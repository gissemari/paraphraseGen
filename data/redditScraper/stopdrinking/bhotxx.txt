Hey there - had intention of posting more and reading more posts but this week has been insane - posted earlier about child in hospital - she is HOME! And despite the crazy week of late nights early mornings dispensing meds (a LOT of them) and not sleeping great I still didn't drink. There were moments when it wasn't easy - but with support I was able to not drink ..I know that this struggle is not over. I know that there will be other triggers. But today I am thankful that this past few days were more than okay without that old numbifier-in-a-bottle alcohol ! ..Thank you all - and to friends and family that I reached out to as well - you all rock ! ..IWNDWYT!
