This is the longest streak of sobriety I've ever accomplished and I'm ecstatic!..I couldn't have done it without everyone's support here at stop drinking. So thank you to everyone for sharing your stories and advice with me personally and every one else here that is struggling...I can honestly say that I'm so grateful and happy to be alive for the first time in many years...Much love to everyone  ..IWNDWYT

Massive accomplishment congratulations. 100 felt amazing - it's my longest streak too! 
Way to go! 90 days was when I started to feel free. Keep on truckin'! IWNDWYT

Congrats! Statistically if you make it this far you are much more likely to stick with it. I personally felt 90 days was a big turning point for me. It was right at that point where I noticed the obsessive thoughts about alcohol and the cravings had significantly decreased. Good work! Keep that ball rolling!
You're welcome. :) Cheersing your continued success with my Topo Chico!
