Stuff I've noticed and things that have gone well and not-so-well these last several weeks: ..I was using drinking to numb myself but it was having the opposite effect. Consumption of alcohol has that cumulative effect on mental state- it's a CNS depressant after all   and I had been living under a cloud for a long time. Coming out of that cloud has been educational. It's not magic though. I still have work to do on myself to become more patient more mellow less irritable   all things I'd been blunting with a couple or four drinks after work for years. With all that said   I highly recommend to those of you considering it to figure out what it's like not to be hung over at all   not even a little - for several days or weeks in a row. It's something....Work mixers are just as much fun to attend (maybe a little more) without a drink. I'll grab a diet coke or some sparkling water and sip that. Lame excuses like  eh medication  or  long drive ahead  work just fine   most people aren't going to push you on that. The fun comes when your coworkers get a drink or so in and let their guard down a little   it's possible to play off that and have 50% of the relaxed attitude without catching a buzz. I'm not sure of the long-term success rate on this but since I have to figure out a way to not skip every one of those types of events it'll be a work in progress. One of my early indications that I might have finally tipped over into  problem drinker  state was a particularly drunken evening with my boss a couple years ago. Since that's the case I have a built in reminder of what not to do and since I'm well aware by now that drink one leads to two three five eight and on and on- best to just stick to club soda....Geez louise but visiting my parents is a huge trigger- had my closest brush with relapse this last weekend with them. Loud kids (my kids) and myself out of pocket/ out of routine stressful interactions with mom and dad over their increasing age worry over weird decisions they're making bad sleep on the road etc. Except for the H(hungry- cause mom cooks great) I was all the other three of the HALT acronym. Totally set up for disaster I spent the $25-30 I would have blown on booze over the long weekend on day passes to a local gym and sweated out the crazy that way. Pretty sure my folks think I'm nuts at this point but oh well   at least I didn't drink. Visited with an old friend while I was up there   spent a couple hours walking around his farm with my kids running wild and just catching up. We COULD have gone to get a beer maybe (it was on offer for the next night but I declined) but it was plenty easy just to talk through what's happened in life for both of us without that crutch. Beers aren't everything and I am glad I got to spend that time with the guy with perfect clarity around what we were talking about.  ...Discussion in another thread about/around  what makes an alcoholic  made me wonder if I'm more comfortable calling myself one (and this is a recent thing) than my wife is. Her realization that she was/is married to someone with a substance problem even if a comparatively minor one has been hard on her. We're working through this   so far we're on the  complete abstinence from drinking  plan for both of us and it's working but I'm the only one with an issue. She has never been much of a drinker and claims that she figured out early on that if she wanted anyone to be sober enough to get us home (!) that she'd have to stay sober herself. Not as sure here but I think she's sticking to the TV/movie/book version of an alcoholic where everything is a total mess nothing seems to go right legal problems lost jobs etc. Since I don't have any of those signifiers it took me a few years to get around her reluctance to label me and go on and label myself. ...Last thing (thanks for those who are sticking with me)- I am a music nerd and will go see a band at a bar if it's one I want to see. In my past that would have meant I'd be coming home late smelling like beer and probably over the legal limit. A few times I'm sure I drove home well well into  we're just going to arrest you right here sir enjoy your DUI  territory. Not proud of it but it happened and I have to own that even though I managed to skip those consequences. Now   I don't have to worry about it. Before I started my sobriety project I bought myself a ticket to see Willie Nelson. It was about week three   I wouldn't advocate anyone on shaky legs like I was go to a bar and see a concert but I wasn't going to burn the $60 either. I went and it was fine. Show was immensely enjoyable I got to see one of my idols play and I didn't drink a drop. Didn't have to fight the line at the bar. Didn't have to find the bathroom 2-3x. Didn't have to worry about leaving a credit card behind or forgetting to close my tab or anything. Walk in stake out a great spot by the stage (again   don't have to fight back to bar so why not?) watch the show go home. It was still fun- he opened with  Whiskey River  and while I cheered along with everybody else I didn't have a drink of my own   and I didn't miss it. ..In summary- life is needlessly complicated by booze. So I'm not drinking today. .

Congrats on your progress. Man your "numb" paragraph really hit close to home. 
Congrats! Looked like we stopped on the same day.  How cool!
