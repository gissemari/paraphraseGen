My girlfriend went on vacation last Saturday an I totally relapsed.  I posted about it a couple of days ago.  Well the good news is that I probably still have my job.  I got a Doctor's note and they said come back to work tomorrow.  The shakes are going away and the headache is almost gone.  I actually went out today and didn't purchase any alcohol.  I'm really going to try this time and I think this sub can help.  The true test is when my girlfriend comes back tomorrow.  She hasn't answered my texts and I think her kids said something to her.  If she kicks me out then my only option is a homeless shelter.  I can't do rock bottom.  Wish me luck.  Day 1 is about to be over!

You can do this man. Just don't pick up that next one.
You got this! We're all right here with you. ..IWNDWYT
If your fingers are typing they can't hold a bottle. Lurk comment post. Isolation is the enemy! We can all do this -together-...IWNDWYT
This sub CAN help! Day one is the hardest by far. Get those first 24 and then build some momentum!
Rooting for you. If they can understand relapse then I think it'll be ok. Take care of the kids and the job.
