Last night I relapsed. Got drunk with a few people. I'd had a mega stressful day and gave in to a couple of glasses of wine which turned into a few more. I didn't do anything stupid but have felt mega anxious and light headed all day. ..My badge has been reset and I see this as a lesson learned. It was NOT worth it...Keep sober guys and girls.

The important thing is that you're getting back on the horse - good job and best of luck.  Remember there's the chatroom in the sidebar if you're ever really feeling the urge.
Good luck today then!  .Maybe you can remember how weird bad anxious you feel today and use that to help keep you from the next time.   .That's one of my tools to help me when I want a drink that I don't want to feel like ass later and I want to be at my full potential at all times possible. Remembering being hung over or even the slightest little bit slower or cloudy; so that it's never worth it to drink now.
You didn't really "relapse" since you have not had a period of solid recovery yet. Notice I said "yet"! It's part of your recovery journey now. You learn from it and don't drink one day at a time again. Best of luck to you!
Relapse is never a good thing. But they do sometimes happen and if we are lucky we can learn something from them. Don't beat yourself up too bad but do not see this as "not that bad" simply because you didn't do anything too stupid while drunk...So what did you learn from this? What do you plan on doing differently so it doesn't happen again?
Good news is that recovery ruins your drinking. Not that it was so good before you quit...
