I am so excited to finally hit triple digits! The first 30 days felt like 6 months - it's been a struggle and a lot of hard work - this has been a battle for 20 years - seriously started to work on it 3 years ago.  I've never gotten this far - and I never thought I would actually enjoy being sober.  Fact is I am a better mother wife worker all around person.  NO - life's not perfect but everyday gets better.  This sub has made all the difference.  I read it every night...thank you!  Looking forward for the next 100!  I won't drink with any of you today!
