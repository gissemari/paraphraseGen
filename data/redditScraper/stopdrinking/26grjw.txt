I've been sober since early April. Definitely before the 10th I think the 3rd or the 4th was the day I last drank but honestly I can't remember. I've had a lot of stuff going on that I doubt I would have been able to deal with if I was going out drinking every night. I'm kicking ass at my new job I moved learned a lot of new things on the guitar and just generally feel better and happy and I'm in a position to be able to do those things because I'm sober. I even made it through my 22nd birthday sober. Last year I was really wanting to be sober at 21 but I ended up caving. I'm bummed and pissed at myself that I spent another year making the same mistakes but I'm glad that I'm not drinking today. Reading everything everyone posts on here helps a lot. I don't go to meetings but this really supplements it for me...I've even gone to a couple parties where friends of mine were drinking and I felt no need to drink and wasn't pressured to. The thought entered my mind but was quickly dispelled and it wasn't even a willpower thing it was like "Why would I want to drink? I know that I'll have much more fun and be happier sober." I am so glad at how much less stressful and complicated my life has been because of this...After more than a year of struggling not to drink and never making it more than 27 days I am feeling great. All of my friends are supportive and my life is quickly becoming centered around many other things...My flair is wrong way wrong. But whatever...I'm rambling but we do that a lot. Thank you everyone. I believe in you all so much. If I can make it this far you can all make it. Everyone here is an inspiration to me. The people with more than 20 years and the people with 1 day. Thank you so much and way to go.
