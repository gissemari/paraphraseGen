Over the past six months my anxiety disorder and my regular out-of-the-blue panic attacks progressively got worse and   surprise!   so did my drinking. Despite having had stretches of sobriety in the past the alcoholic part of my brain which is to say the part of my brain that has no tolerance for pain took over. Eventually   13 days ago   I would reach a bottom that I hadn't yet experienced. It got to the point where the pain of drinking surpassed the pain of my anxiety and panic for what felt like the first time. So I had to stop. This has been the longest I've gone without a drink since late August. I've always caved around day 7 or 8 which is when the anxiety becomes  intolerable . But this time I had to push through it. I had no choice. I do not have another drink-hangover-despair-repeat in me I just don't...Needless to say the last three or four days have been incredibly difficult. My anxiety keeps getting triggered so so so easily and pre-panic attack symptoms are present throughout the entire day. I keep feeling like I can't breathe another anxiety symptom even though I know I obviously can (the mind in pain is a cunning thing like that). There are other symptoms too but you get the point...But! Despite what feels like walking through mud that's thigh-deep sometimes I am filled with relief hope and even joy for the first time since last August. I know that I can't drink and if I do it won't kill the anxiety it will just come back. I mean I've *known* that this whole time but again   the mind in pain is a cunning thing...So I was wondering SD if any of you guys can relate. What helped you? What kept you going? I know this is a pretty mental health heavy post so it may alienate some of you guys but if any of you have any advice at all I am all ears...Thanks and I won't drink with you guys today...

Exercise was so so important in easing my anxiety early on. Even if it is just a walk around the block it can be super helpful...And I wish I had known about meditation in the beginning. I can't even tell you how that has changed my brain. I was able to learn enough with the 10 free headspace sessions to do it on my own now. OMG! It is amazing...After the first month I saw a marked decrease in my general anxiety just from the elimination of alcohol from my system. Now I have almost no anxiety at all. ..It takes time but you are going in the right direction. Congrats on 12 days. Keep going!
