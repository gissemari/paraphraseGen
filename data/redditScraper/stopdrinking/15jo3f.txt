and NO it is not alcohol. I used to play music on and off the past several years. I would say I can play Guitar and bass at an OK level I suck at drums and I struggle with playing acoustic but in the 5 days I have not drank or done drugs I saved enough to buy a cheap but decent acoustic guitar and put an electric one on layaway at a local pawnshop. I'm not gonna lie if I say I was tempted to go and have a drink or call my hook up but I walked into the pawnshop and went for the guitars..It feels good it feels really good AND thank you reddit for being here with me..

That sir is a damn good way to go!..As a drummer there are few ways outside of speedbags or firearms for relieving stress and forgetting...what needs to be forgotten about. ..Well met!
Good start. Keep staying sober and things will just get better.
Congrats HouseofX!  Good choice!
that is awesome man! I played mostly bass but guitar as well for about 7-8 years but since my life got really rough and my drinking became a huge problem I have watched my guitars collect dust for too long... Music is one of the best hobbies there is - stick with it! You inspire me
I started playing before I quit drinking but I've definitely upped my skill level since I quit. Practicing is something I look forward to most every day... Here is my [soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/phlebotomy) if you guys like electronic music.
SO AMAZING how fast your curiosity and creativity comes back when you didn't even realize it was gone...I actually love being sober.  I obviously love booze too...but I am really not having ANY trouble staying away.  Of course...that remains to be seen but for now.....Congratulations!
