Hey SD! Happy Monday! Hope you enjoyed a lovely weekend...I recently read this article http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/connecticut-homeless-man-returned-10k-check-big-reward-article-1.3654636 that tells a lovely heartwarming story about *paying it forward*. A business owner lost a $10K check; it was found by Mr. Elmer Alvarez a homeless gentleman in Connecticut. Mr. Alvarez didn't think twice - he promptly returned the check to the rightful owner Ms. Roberta Hoskie. As it turns out Ms. Hoskie was also homeless at one point in her life. She immediately expressed her thanks and gratitude to Mr. Alvarez in such an amazing way - she offered a scholarship to real estate school career counseling and job interviews! And it doesn't end there: she also offered transportation services and schooling for English as a second language! And Mr. Alvarez wasn't even expecting anything in return! What a beautiful AoK :)...What really stood out was her statement: *"This winter you don't have to worry about being out in the cold".* It immediately reminded me of SD; we will never leave our family members here 'out in the cold'. If you're struggling lonely happy or sad **you always have a home here at SD with us!** Take advantage of it - **lean on us** **let us carry you**. We *get it* and you'll never be alone...Do you have anything to share this week? Have you experienced any Acts of Kindness? Let us know we'd love to hear it!..Love Peace and Sobriety Lee &lt;3

Love.Peace. Freedom. Sobriety. To is all
We had a group this weekend who assembled  care packs  for some of our shelters.  We ask everyone in our organization that when they travel collect the single use/disposable toiletries from where they lodge. ..We created several hundred  bags  with basics that people need - things like toothpaste soap shampoo toothbrush combs/brushes personal hygiene items etc.  ..We deliver them to shelters.
Oh that's so cool. So sweet.....And there was a story last week about a young couple that raised 150k+ for a homeless guy's housing etc... because he helped the woman who was stranded in her car one day. With his last $20 he bought gas for her car... and kept her safe...http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/24/us/couple-raises-money-for-homeless-man/index.html..As for me not sure if this counts but I had a friend over and let her talk and talk for hours about her relationship trouble. We also had some fun though -- made tea and I ordered food :) But yeah I was listening *a lot*! .....
I recently joined the board of a non-profit that provides inpatient and outpatient treatment for women recovering from addiction and behavioral health problems. We have a lot of great non-profits in our community and it can difficult to bring attention - and funding - to an organization that focuses on helping women find their own resilience. It doesn't have the media attention that cancer does or the cute factor of a kids' charity. But having worked so hard to achieve my own sobriety I know this program is much needed and life changing. As usual giving back has a boomerang effect!.
My daughter and I went out to eat and we split a dinner and they gave her a biscuit and some corn.  Then they said they'd clean up after we left.  It had the bus bins set up kind of implying that you bus your own table...  That was really nice of them because they didn't have to do any of that.
When I pick up my oldest son after school we pass the same expressway in Chicago. There is the same homeless man we see day after day.( Here in the Chi...the same people will work the same exit/entrances) I talk to my 7 year old candidly about homelessness. He understands some of the reasons of why it happens but is also taught that regardless of why people end up in that situation we should be kind less judgmental and more charitable. Some days we pack him a lunch with sandwich gatorade granola bars etc. .My kids are very fortunate as we live a pretty comfortable lifestyle...I want them to have perspective. Plus people just need kindness and to know someone cares. 
There was a Marine vet that had just started a business similar to mine in one of my FB groups looking for answers. so I called and offered to give him all of my secret marketing tools for free. So appreciative and a great guy. Day three sucks.  But I will not drink with any of you today.
