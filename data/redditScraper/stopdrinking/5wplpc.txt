I had been experiencing some pretty bad cravings this past weekend. Not sure why I've been pretty good about managing urges over the last 50-something days but suddenly...all I could think of was having a glass of wine (hah "just one" - ya know?)...Anyway I voiced this to my SO on Friday/Saturday and he was pretty good about it. We switched dinner plans from going out to a restaurant to ordering in to remove the temptation. He let me talk through how I keep thinking "well I just feel like I'm going to drink eventually what's the difference?" and we stayed active --went swimming at the pool went for a walkand watched a movie.(Fundamentals of Caring on Netflix - I liked it check it out!)..On Sunday I had dinner with my big family who were (almost) all drinking red wine and joking about my sobriety: "you'll SO regret this 'break' you're doing when you're pregnant!" Hah. They don't think I have a problem which is ironic because two of them went through AA and are still sober. They just don't want to see me as an alcoholic too I guess. It's a long story but mostly I think they want me to be the "good one" after one of my sisters struggled through several drug rehabs. ..Anyway I white knuckled through dinner wanting to cave so many times but just thinking about how close I was to 60 days. Even yesterday I was struggling with the "oh what's the point I'll never keep this up" but kept coming back to not wanting to reset and just making it through today. It was actually my dad someone I consider an alcoholic who still drinks who finally said he was proud of me (....as he opened more wine and made a joke about "look how much we have in stock since you quit!!").  His way of being supportive so I wasn't mad...Today I finally feel like the cravings have subsided and I'm so so happy I didn't cave. I think reading the Naked Mind was helpful to me as my brain has now switched back to "why drink poison" and "one day at a time mode." Feels good...Just wanted to post for accountability and for anyone out there who keeps thinking "oh what's the point" to remember that the point is taking care of yourself everyone else be damned!..Thank you all for being here I think I checked this sub 10x a day the last few days. You are all great day 1 or day 10000! <3..Edit: spelling ..

Those challenges make you stronger each time! The best part is that it gets easier. It really does.
Congratulations that's a lot to get through! I struggled a lot with tempting thoughts this past weekend as well. 2 months is usually the time I cave and relapse so reading this was really encouraging. Thanks for sharing.
