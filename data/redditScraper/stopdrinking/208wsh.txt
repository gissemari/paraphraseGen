I passed six months of sobriety on February 19. I was having a really hard couple of weeks (hard month really) around that time and I found myself and feeling pretty shitty. A couple of weeks ago I finally ended an extremely detrimental and toxic relationship (one I had posted about before). I was a mess. I asked my doctor for antidepressants and started weekly therapy and I am feeling worlds better. I miraculously qualified for free weekly therapy at a non-profit in my city. I wish I had done it sooner. I feel like my support system is much stronger. Quitting alcohol has brought a lot of painful childhood/adolescent memories to the surface. Quitting alcohol has not healed my pain but I can now work on healing it. I'm so glad for the opportunity to actually be a real person with feelings and goals (who reaches these goals!) with the ability to be there for myself and for others. I'm also glad that I was finally able to remove myself from that toxic relationship. It took way too long which I'm definitely not proud of and it was a real threat to my sobriety. ...I started therapy just in time because we found out that my mom's cancer is back so I'm definitely going to need the extra support. I also ended that relationship just in time. It's crazy how the universe works but I feel like these things kind of happened at the "right" time if there was ever any "right" time. I just mean the timing could have been much worse. I'm not looking for any sympathy as we've been dealing with this for two years and I also have an extremely complicated relationship with my mom. ...I went out to eat at a fancy Mexican place last night. Someone sent over frozen swirly margaritas for us at the end of our meal despite our earlier declination of the drinks. I did not drink and I am immensely grateful that I didn't. It was an extremely weird feeling when he came over and set this admittedly pretty tasty looking swirly pink and white very strong smelling drink in front of me. My dining partner moved the drinks to the other end of the table so I couldn't smell it at my request and then returned them to the bar. I just felt very strange about it afterwards like it spooked me a bit. I didn't feel like I was in danger of drinking it. I didn't *want* to drink it. But I came home and read this sub for about an hour last night to try to shake the feeling. That's also why I'm posting. Margaritas always gave me a headache anyway....I hope everyone is having a great Wednesday. Hopefully this might serve as a reminder to at least one person that if you're struggling it's okay to ask for some extra help. And to not stay in a relationship with someone who treats you like crap. :)

I'm so glad you checked in; and I'm so glad you're able to be fully  there for your Mom and family in this tough time.  Hang in there.
Bravo for six plus months. Sounds like you're taking recovery seriously. I enjoyed your post. It reminded me of an Easter brunch when someone put a glass of pink champagne in front of me. The iridescent bubbly loveliness didn't fool me. I was able to see through the glass to what I knew alcohol did to me when I drank it. The poison was so cleverly disguised. Like you it was an unsettling feeling but reaffirmed my commitment to sobriety. ..I'm sorry about your breakup. I too went through something similar and it was rough. My sponsor said it gave me an opportunity to use the tools of the program and it sure did. Therapy is also a big help and am glad you have that support in light of your mother's unfortunate illness. ..Don't be a stranger. Be well.
