That title was snarky wasn't it? I could just post "Oh hooray for me 7 months!" and wait for the congratulatory comments but I think I'll post something a little more useful. So here it goes:..How my life has changed over the past seven months:..Externals:..*  Bathroom and kitchen remodeled (I'd been putting off since I moved in two years ago)..* I'm down 35lbs.* I'm able to commit to a fitness lifestyle.* I'm killing it at work and currently waiting on being promoted into a new position paperwork is processing.* My house is clean. Always..* My dog is happy..* I'm no longer broke by pay day..* I have money in savings..* I'm a better friend flaking on people is a thing of the past. When I say I'll be there I'm there...Internals:..* My sleep is the best I've ever had..* My depression has not been back since I quit drinking. Do I have shitty days? Yes but doesn't everybody? No big deal..* My anxiety has gone from overwhelming to just "a little nervous every once in a while"..* My self esteem is getting to where I want it. I'm making far fewer bad choices I've developed integrity and I'm learning that it really IS true: Life is what you make it. So I'm making it..* I'm identifying my core values (integrity perseverance love commitment responsibility and joy) things I could give a flying fuck about when I was loaded...What it's like now:..* I have no cravings. Once in a while I'll have a passing thought about drinking but that's just it. A passing thought..* I AM NOT STRUGGLING OR SUFFERING. I simply am not drinking. It's no hardship there's no deprivation I see alcohol for what it is and for what it's effect has been on my life in that past. No thanks. Bye Felicia..* I can go anywhere and do anything with no fear of accidentally getting drunk. In fact I can drink if I want to. I just don't want to. Having said that bars are boring and drunks are irritating. I don't go to bars..* I don't miss my "friends" I didn't have a lot of true friends I had a lot of people to sit around and get drunk with we all gave each other permission to stay boozy and just being around each other validated our life choices. Soooo..I don't have a lot in common with them anymore and they don't have a lot of common with me. Awkward..LOL..* I cannot see myself going back to it. I don't see the value in it anymore. I know that it's a life stealing time stealing trap. I've done my time. No thanks...How?:..* Read This Naked Mind.* Had enough.* Changed EVERYTHING. Morning routine negative and damaging self thought defeatist attitude (fake it til you make it kinda WORKS) quit smoking TV watching habits quit Facebook stopped comparing my insides to other peoples outsides I READ before bed sometimes now it goes on and on. I guess what I'm really doing is EXAMINING everything and weeding out the shit that doesn't serve me...I sound smug as hell and I'm sorry for that I just want you to know that it can be done there's no magic to it. Life is DIFFERENT but FAR BETTER now. I'm still learning who I am and what I like I don't have all the answers I just know what quitting has done for me. I'm hoping the same for you...I read this sub every day. Every. Day. I want to thank ALL of you for your posts. You're inspirational. Thank you...EDIT: FORMATTING NIGHTMARE I'M TRYING TO FIX IT.
