I naturally have anxiety. I've struggled with depression on and off also. I've felt the urge- especially when things become tough. Some issues arose with work and it was upsetting but I was able to cope..I went on a very nice date with someone I was excited to see / be with and it was great. She ordered a drink. I mentioned when asked that I won't be drinking...But for whatever reason I was struggling to resist going "Ahh I'll just have one." Or "I'll just have A sip just to try it." All these thoughts started rushing to me...Then I became more and more anxious as I became more self-aware of these thoughts now I had to hide this while on this wonderful date and try to maintain my composure. Negative feedback loop. It was a terrible feeling...I feel guilty for whatever reason looking back. I don't know why..This is new to me. I'm struggling to cope with my emotions. I feel I'm more susceptible to irritability and mood changes let alone whatever response I underwent when I was in the presence of a drink...This isn't very coherent but it's new to me. I don't know what's normal and what's not and it's been 3ish months. I guess I just had to share- see if others have any similar experience.

That's s tough new position to be in. I have found that the best way to deal with situations that you would normally drink in is to have a plan and be prepared.  I have answers to questions that might come up. I plan on what I am going to order.  Something special to occupy my hands and drinking habit.  I do these things casually and with confidence as if it's totally normal. And it is. Also have an exit plan if things get dodgey. ..Planning will help the cravings and anxiety loop. It's early in your sober life so don't get down on yourself you survived and sober to learn from it. 
Hi there!..Power through! 6 months got very difficult for me. Suddenly I couldn't see the point. And anyway would I ever stop wanting to drink?..It's crazy eh?..I wreck my life and then 6 months and I want to wreck it again...I got very difficult. I was managing but resenting it. I told myself just get through another day whatever I can drink whenever I want but I won't today I won't now...It's suddenly gotten easier.
