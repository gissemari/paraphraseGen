I hate to say it but forced sobriety is better than none at all.. I'm really struggling here. I haven't had a solid 48 hours since my last visit to a psych ward in summer of last year. Especially since it's my weekend where usually I'd drink myself into oblivion. Usually I'd be passed out at this point of the day. .But I didn't drink yesterday went to work and stayed as productive as possible. Didn't drink today instead finally did the dishes vacuumed and mopped the floors and the hardest part cleaned out and threw away all the empty bottles... it really hits you in the face seeing all that money spent and time wasted thrown into a waste bin..Despite struggling with cravings and withdrawal I feel.. almost relieved. Relieved that I no longer have an excuse if I drink I could fail a random UA and go to jail and get into worse trouble. I'm not risking it. I'm not giving alcohol that kind of power over my life anymore..Tomorrow is another day and I will power through it as hard as it is for me in these early stages.. I know it's not as impressive as a week a month or even a year. But I know I can get there..IWNDWYT.

I believe in your recovery. Everyone does recovery one day at a time. 
Understanding the power of alcohol is huge. Now you can start to look at it for what it really is an addictive chemical that lies to you. You just have to remember that and fight off its urges.
