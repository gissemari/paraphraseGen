I don't really have anything profound to say.  I just wanted to acknowledge this somewhere and I'm not one to walk around telling people IRL about a sobriety milestone.  I feel like I actually broke free.  It's weird because there isn't this actual MOMENT when you know you're done.  It's a gradual change and one day the struggle is gone.  Maybe not for everyone but for me it is.  Getting a badge here and then failing over and over really helped me along with reading This Naked Mind and generally just wanting to not waste any more of my life being drunk and stupid.  Anyway thanks to everyone for sharing their stories and helping good people turn their lives around.
