I'm pretty sure I've been in denial about my relationship with alcohol. If there's alcohol in the house I'll drink it. Doesn't really matter what it is. I'll sneak it behind my SO's back. ..Every time I tell myself "Just one beer" it's never just one. It's usually "as many beers as it takes for me to reach the point where I realize 'wow ok that was one too many'"...I can't stop once I've started so I'm going to stop starting. I don't know if I'll ever have a responsible relationship with alcohol again. I managed to stop drinking entirely for the nine months my wife was pregnant but relapsed after the baby was born. So I'm going to try again.
