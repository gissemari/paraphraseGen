I was having a particulary bad week with some medication changes and feeling agitated and abnormal. Convinced myself that drinking beer was my only option to feel better. I drank 3 and then quit. I am 6-6 300lbs so I didn't feel even buzzed but did get quite a headache.  I am a little concerned that this happened and I want to prevent any full blown relapse.  I am surveying how this happened and what I can do about it in the future.  I just feel so abnormal at times and want to feel normal.  I was waiting on my mood to lift but it seemed relentless.  Alcohol always seemed to reset my mood for a few days.  Anyone else have mental illness and struggle with this problem?  When I feel good no problem staying sober and I love it.  I look at alcohol with disgust and wonder why I ever drank it.  I am taking this as a very big learning experience.  I can't even imagine how I would have felt if I had gotten drunk.

I drank for many reasons but one was that I never felt quite comfortable in my own skin. That feeling of being "abnormal" could trigger me at times too. Therapy helped a lot with dealing with those sorts of feelings. Best wishes!
Well it totally sucks when your body chemistry is out of whack.  I'm still working to get my life and balance.  I think you can view this as a one-off especially since you already see alcohol for what it is to you - namely toxic...On those times when I did indulge "just-a-bit" I had to redouble my efforts to find balance and really focus on my sobriety.
