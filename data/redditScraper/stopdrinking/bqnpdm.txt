Hi there ..I saw your post just now on my way home from work and I just wanted to say I'm glad you posted. I've pledged for my day one over and over and I've posted and deleted my comments here many times over because I feel embarrassed too - even when I know this is the least judge-y nook on the whole web!..I'm going to be strong for another Day 1 and stay sober tonight (and it's probably because I was lucky enough to see your brave post)..Thanks!!
Welcome back.  Not everyone makes it back please see this as a gift...For me the whole journey has been about repairing and rebuilding my self esteem that wasn't good in the first place and then was trampled by shame guilt and the people I drunkenly picked....
