I was always a heavy social drinker in college and into my late twenties. A little over 2 years ago I found out I was pregnant with my first child and I abstained from drinking during the pregnancy. After my daughter was born 18 months ago I struggled with PPD and anxiety. I wanted to go on medication but my husband did not want me to. I turned to something much worse- drinking at all times of the day to try to sleep. ..I went back to work after my maternity leave but didn't stop drinking. It's only gotten to be more and more as my tolerance had built up. My employer doesn't suspect anything because I'm very much a functioning alcoholic. My husband doesn't even know when I'm drinking because I hide it from him. ..I've stopped drinking a few times over the past year- anywhere from 5 to 10 days at a time but this time is different. I'm committed to staying sober for my family and my health (I've had all sorts of health issues lately due to the drinking). ..So now Day 1 is complete. I had some shakes and anxiety but actually slept better than I have while boozing. I took melatonin and I'm feeling pretty good this morning. So onto Day 2 and many more days to come.

I'm proud of you. As a mother who has a drinking problem as well I can relate. Stay strong. You got this! 
Welcome and congratulations!  ..The secret drinking is something I was very good at.  Very freeing to not do that anymore.  I haven't lied or let anyone down in 4 months.  That feels good.  Do this for you first.  I just had to be very aware of the timeline....when I got to several weeks and then several months thought I had this licked and the negotiation in my mind began again.  I did not cave this time.   It will get easier and better.  The I CANT DRINK will turn into I WONT DRINK.  ..Keep us posted.
That's amazing! Way to go. I will not drink with you today.
