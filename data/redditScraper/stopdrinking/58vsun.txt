Dark Days: A Memoir - D. Randall Blythe..https://www.amazon.com/Dark-Days-D-Randall-Blythe/dp/0306823144..Richmond Magazine July 2015 ." Dark Days brings readers deep roughly 500 pages deep into [Blythe's] bout with alcoholism and through the still-surreal story of being arrested jailed and tried on charges that he caused the death of a teenage fan injured at a 2010 Lamb of God concert. ..This book really got to me in a very positive way. Metal hardcore and all forms of heavy music are a touchy subject with me. I'm still a big fan but sometimes it reminds me of a time when my only goal was to wake up do as many drugs and drink as much as possible until everything went black. Every single day. It's hard for me to disassociate this type of music with my past as it's a constant reminder of certain situations states of mind and overall mood of that time...Reading Randys struggle with that part of his life really spoke to me. Being a huge fan of LOG at one point this served as a much needed reminder. Alcoholism can grab a hold of anyone.  Any shape and size. Any religion. Rich or poor. Famous or not. You're not a piece of trash. You can turn things around...I will not drink with you today SD! Have a great Saturday night!

Just ordered it from the library :) Thanks!
Will look at it
Amazon Prime has As the Palaces Burn. I would be curious to see how he comes across in text. Sometimes easier to read. For example Meet the real me by Dave Mustaine from Megadeth is a good read. He certainly has a way about him but the struggle and recovery could be anyone. I want to read the Duff McKagan one next but am to cheap to buy it. May be the library has it.
