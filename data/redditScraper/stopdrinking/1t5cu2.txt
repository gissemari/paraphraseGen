This by Brandi Carlile and about a family member of hers who has struggled with alcoholism. She is one of my favorite artists in general and this has been one of my favorite songs about recovery as I've gone through treatment for depression over the past year and I thought I'd share it here...[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNmo8I4dEQE) is the music video on youtube and [here](http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brandicarlile/thatwasntme.html) are the lyrics...> When you're lost you will toss every lucky coin you'll ever trust..> And you'll hide from your God like he ever turns his back on us..> And you will fall all the way to the bottom and land on your own knife..> And you'll learn who you are even if it doesn't take your life

Haha this is the song I thought you meant at first .https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXNynSG5--g&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player (shaggy:wasn't me)..Needless to say I was a bit confused..Good song though:)
I went to a Brandi Carlile concert this summer; oh man. Really good...She didn't do her cover of [Forever Young](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Awi_KWs1o4) at the concert but it is my favorite of hers.
