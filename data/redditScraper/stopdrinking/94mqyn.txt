This is weird as hell. I was going about my business on this bank holiday weekend; cleaned the house listened to music read a book and then BAM! FOMO hits me like a train wreck. ..What did I do to bring this on myself? Instagram. Full of pictures of gin tastings bbqs with lots of beer and the general merriment of the long weekend depicted by my normie (and not so normie) friends...What do I do to combat this devil? I let the feelings pass me by post on SD and hit the hay. I'll go for a swim tomorrow morning in Dublin Bay while most of this town will be dying of a hangover and regrets of drinking...Thank fuck that's not my life anymore. But fuck you FOMO. Fuck you...Night peeps stay safe. X

good job letting it pass! that is why i haven't been on social media for a while now and i personally am more at peace because of it.
Fuck you FOMO. Love that. I get anxiety just opening FB so I've stayed away. 
Get some JOMO  **Joy of Missing Out**  wake up tomorrow knowing where you are who you are with no warrants no cringy texts maybe some money in your pocket
