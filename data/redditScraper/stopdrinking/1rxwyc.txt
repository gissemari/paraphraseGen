Running was always my one-upping method. I was good and will be good again. My ex drank since he was 14. His friend started him with peppermint schnapps. When I was 21 my ex gave me my first sip. I liked the energy it gave me. I was always a bit drained from running so much. Soon it became a weekly routine to drink. Then drinking started to take over and ruin us. I moved away and he followed and the drinking got worse. I dropped out of grad school and began isolating and running away from everything. We moved back home and the drinking was totally a part of our lives. Yet I could still run like the wind. I broke up with him and dated somebody else quit the drinking and reached some major running milestones. However the drinking mentality was still there. It came back and I ran away again and self isolated for about 3 years...avoiding real work and struggling with relationships. I know I'm smart. I know I have strong morals. I stand up for everything I believe...when I'm drunk now. I run...sometimes. I have trouble holding a job and relationships and am making my current relationship difficult. My communications skills are awful as I tend to hide behind the Internet. BUT......I was thinking about what made me confident and how I lost that. I think getting some help and starting Cymbalta has brought this back. I have a running skill that takes me places. I have intelligence and love self-teaching and self-improvement. I have huge life goals. I'm different and better than so many lazy quitters I know. I can one-up so many people with my accomplishments and take pride in myself. BUT I CAN'T IF I DRINK...So I'm going to be better than the rest again by quitting my drinking. It may sound arrogant but I've been given some unusual gifts that I refuse to waste. I'm pretty descent looking when I'm in shape. I have a sharp mind when I'm in shape. I get to travel and earn income when I'm in shape. I'm not like the lazy quitters.

As a broken down former marathoner and current avid road cyclist; I had been sober and working a program of recovery.  Perhaps I would have been able to utilize the tools of recovery and the wisdom to have prolonged my athleticism.  Don't get me wrong I'm thrilled to still be riding after all these years but I do get a little wistful when youngsters blow by me along the road...There is a tremendous synergy in athleticism and sobriety.
What ever it takes.
