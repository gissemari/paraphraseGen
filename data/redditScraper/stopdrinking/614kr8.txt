I came across this thread yesterday and a lot of stories I could relate to.. I have been struggling to stop for a few years now but it has only gotten worse. Now I'm in jeopardy of losing my SO and job if I don't stop. Reading stories from here helped me get through yesterday and also today. Friends and loved ones don't seem to understand that it isn't as easy as it sounds but hearing others here talk about their own journey and success is a big motivation! Its only day two but I feel good about it this time.. I know I can do it!

Well Day 2 is not "only" anything. It is two days of not drinking. Well done - there is a chat room too - the link is on the right hand side. ..I hang out here and in SD chat and go to online Smart Recovery meetings and read lots of stuff. Any thing to fill up my time so I won`t drink...Good luck with your recovery I hope it goes well for you.
Great job on the two days!
That is fantastic!  Great job :D  I've found too that friends &amp; family don't really get it.  And/or if they maybe do or a little bit they're only interested to such a degree.  I find /r/stopdrinking gets it far better and I've found a lot of solace and wisdom here.  and that's after years of lurking too.  Welcome to SD and I know you can do it too!  I won't drink with you today :)
I stumbled across this feed by reading an article and it changed my life. Knowing others are going through this struggle gave me hope. Not drinking with you today.
