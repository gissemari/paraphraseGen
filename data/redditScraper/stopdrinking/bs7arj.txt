Wow. I've been reading a lot about the  addictive brain' on this sub and in books like  This Naked Mind' but i've never really noticed it in real life.. until yesterday...We visited a place that is special to us over the years it has become our default spot to have a nice walk have fun and sit&amp;relax...It's also a place we're drinking for me was standard. For years...When we where there yesterday (and i've been there sober before i know it's fun without drinking) my brain immediately started to trigger very stronge urges. ..It was  telling me' that this was a good day for a drink that the summer is coming and drinking here will be great that it's never going to be as much fun as when i was drinking and it kept on going.....This is something i've experienced before but the big difference now compared to previous times is that i am still very early in sobriety (9 days) and this time day 1 was the worst day in my life... i knew right away that these thoughts we're fake it's out of the question that i'm willing to have a drink a week after that day 1...The fact that i could distance myself from these crazy urges and see them for what they are was very special. I've been sober for 65 days in the past and when something like this happened i tried to reason with it thinking it was my own desire and then i relapsed...An important lesson learned! IWNDWYT

Congratulations!  ..I remember that I am **not** the voice in my head...I am the person who can **hear** the voice in my head...It's up to me whether to *listen* to that voice!!
I discovered that my brain was playing tricks on a really hot day last summer. My brain made a *big* mistake though and screwed itself in the process. It gave me cravings and memories of sitting down and enjoying a beer or two on my back deck during a hot summer day. It was telling me that this was the best idea ever that it would be a great reward to myself for doing so well at keeping sober and that I should immediately do it again since I enjoyed it so much in the past. The problem is is that I hate the heat I hate being out in the sun during the day I hate being out there in the evening when the Mosquitoes come out. I've never sat on my back deck and had drinks of any kind in fact I don't even have a table and chairs back there because I would *never* use them. ..My brain outright made up fake cravings and memories out of thin air in an attempt to get me to drink. After that realization those cravings have never held any sway over me. The predator had no teeth.
