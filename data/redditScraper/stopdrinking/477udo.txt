So I have come to a point where I drink alone and pretty much everyday. I've had at lease one drink everyday for about 2 weeks. Sometimes 5-6 drinks. I drive drunk. I work drunk. I see my girlfriend with a buzz. I feel like I can't control it. I'm currently at work and just want to buy some alcohol and go home on my lunch break and have a few drinks. But I won't. I'm struggling. But I've already told myself I can do one day. One day with no drinking. I don't know what will happen tomorrow but today I chose to be sober.

 I'm glad you're here! Everyone will tell you it gets easier and they're right. Just focus on today and distract yourself as much as you need to with whatever you can distract yourself with as long as it's not alcohol...so that you can just get through today! I wish you the best!
Good for you. 24 hours. You can do this!!
Awesome! you have come to the right place!..Have you done the alcohol assessment quiz in the sidebar?
