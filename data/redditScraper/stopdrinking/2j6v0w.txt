He's depressed and he just told me he's been going to a different friend's house every day to get drunk. I don't think he's told anyone else and although I myself have struggled with depression I'm not certain how to help him address the alcoholism. He can't see a mental health worker for quite some time due to scheduling. How can I help him get through this?

Just keep talking to him. Find out what he needs. Some doctors have after hours for this sort of thing too. Make suggestions but don't get discouraged if he doesn't follow through with them. I'm good at making excuses of why I can't get help when I want to keep drinking. Just help him find some resources but remember he has to get help for himself not for you. Opening up to you might be the first time he's reached out for help. Sometimes it takes a long time and many attempts. Be patient and understanding... and try not to enable him. Ask him out to sober activities too. Good luck. You're a good friend
Sadly there is very little you can do. Alcoholics have to want to want to stop and I have yet to see an external force powerful enough to make that happen. I would recommend not drinking with him and maybe check out Alanon for yourself.
