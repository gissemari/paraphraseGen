Giving Sober October a try; what can I lose? I'm almost 60 and drinking for 30 of those. The last many years a half a bottle of Scotch a night. Functional; hasn't affected work no DUIs (I drink at home and usually bed by 10:00). But feel spent and unhappy with myself as many of the posts I've read here and I know I am not the best husband and father I can be. And even though my physicals are OK every year I have to be hurting my health. I quit for a whole year about 6 years ago but when that was up I really wanted to drink and went back at it without much regret. A year later I went 4 months but this time I was let down by the relapse caused by one glass of wine with a dinner. I'll be reading a lot here and hope to learn and maybe eventually give advice myself. Best wishes to all here. I've lurked for a while and finally created an account to post.

Thank you all! I know I can do it for a month. That's the first step. I appreciate finding this subreddit.

I'm also giving sober October a shot! We can do this. My choice of poison has always been wine but iced tea is just as good right?!  ..Sending you strength and positive vibes!
