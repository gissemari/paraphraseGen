... We met in outpatient same sobriety date and have a lot of fun together (straight gal gay guy no 13th stepping involved :) ).He shared tonight that he'd relapsed for just a weekend and is back with a sponsor ..Celebrating 90 days w/o him tomorrow. Proud of myself but sad that we can't celebrate these milestones together now

Sounds like you both keep progressing!  Nothing to be sad about.  You can celebrate being sober TODAY!  That is the most important day sober anyway :)
I'm sorry that happened. Relapse is a bitch. At least he's back in recovery now.
May not be in lockstep but still on the same path in the same direction. Could have been much worse. Gratz on keeping it together for the nine-zero.
Great milestone!
Can share every day together. One day is all we have!
You can still share it with him and he can share it with you. Nothing has helped me more than learning from others (good and bad) we grow regardless.
