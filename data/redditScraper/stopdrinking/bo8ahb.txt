So a little context - I know I'm drinking too much. Have been for the past few years. I get somewhere between tipsy and shitfaced three or four times a week. I want it to stop and today was the day.........So of course I had to have a few drinks last night. Nothing drastic for me just mickey of whiskey. Anyway a friend posted something on Facebook that he apparently meant in better humor than I took it. A few angry posts later...I wake up this morning to his messages telling me I'm a shit person and he doesn't want to be friends anymore. I've known him for 40 years...It's a shit pickle on top of the shit sandwich that is my life. I'm in my mid-forties obese deeply in debt stuck in a job I really don't like but can't leave because of said debt. I have no family (other than my parents - and they are pretty much the only thing that's kept me from ending it one way or another) and a small circle of friends. I've struggled with depression and anxiety for a long as I can remember. I manage it with medication but all that does is keep me barely functional...I'm trying very hard to make small incremental changes to make my life better. I'm paying down my debt. I'm getting interested in new hobbies. I'm eating better and I've lost a bit of weight....but the drinking is sabotaging that of course. ..I'm trying I'm fucking trying but all I'm doing is swimming against the current.

It's a tough swim but one it sounds like you're making progress with...You've probably heard it a million times but your life WILL change for the better without the booze...For your friend - I would call or meet with him to discuss the changes you are making...It helps when you have support from the people that care about you the most.
