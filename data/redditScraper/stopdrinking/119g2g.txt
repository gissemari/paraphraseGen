I've really let myself down.   I'm having a hard time dealing with this.  I want to turn my relapse into a learning experience but I'm too busy beating myself up over it.  I feel like an absolute failure.  I've lost my hope...I need to call my sponsor.  I am waiting for a break at work.  I hope he can offer some guidance.
