I think I've only had a couple of days without drinking recently but I do want to tone it down and eventually stop. It's become a habit self medicating with it before I went back onto antidepressants turned into just drinking. ..I went out on a night out last night and I would usually have drunk everything. I had a couple of glasses and then stopped drinking by 10 when we got to the place where there were three free bottles of spirit on the table. I didn't drink anything apart from coke until we left at 2. That's the first time I think I've turned down any alcohol let alone free alcohol. I feel great this morning and I had a nice time with old friends and new friends. The last time I went out I was a mess. This feels new and different and I've just proved to myself that I can say no - something I've always struggled with. I get such huge Fear Of Missing Out too I always want to be part of the stories rather than hearing about them but I didn't miss out on anything by not drinking and still got to see all the fun. ..This feels good. I just hope I can carry it on.

That's great to hear initially even after I managed to stop myself from buying itfree alcohol posed a challenge for a bit.  Keep up the good work and don't forget this victory.  Let how good you feel this morning fuel many more such days. .IWNDWYT !
