I've had a lot of anxiety in this journey over what my friends will think and do when we're hanging out and they want to drink and I tell them I'm not drinking. ..I posted a while ago about being pleasantly surprised when one friend not only didn't care she also said I inspired her to give up drinking for a few weeks. This was a phenomenal feeling but what about all my other friends? ..Well this weekend I've had my biggest test so far--out of town for a girls weekend with my best friends from college--and I was so worried I would want to drink because I would see them drinking and having fun. To my surprise once I told them I wasn't drinking anymore no one made a big deal out of it no one pressured me or questioned me and no one even offered me any alcohol for the rest of the trip! It just wasn't a big deal at all and I felt like they fully respected my decision and had my back. We even at one point had a frank discussion about all of our habits and how we struggle with feeling in control of our lives. It was amazing and I just wanted to post to say how grateful I am for my dear friends and how it's worth doing something despite your unfounded (or lets face it in some cases founded) fears about how others will react. Now I know why our friendship has lasted for almost 15 years.

that's great to hear.  good for you.  i had a very similar experience.  i was nervous to tell my friends because i was afraid our friendships would change.  well our friendships did change because now i don't drink and they still do but we still hang out and laugh and enjoy each other all the same.  i feel supported and respected too and it's really nice to find that while i was afraid we would turn out to be just drinking buddies we are actually good friends...&lt;3 great job on 86 days!  iwndwyt :D
I saw an old friend today who I haven't seen in over a year and he said I looked so much better than I did a year ago even though I've gained some weight he said he sees a confidence that wasn't there before. I attribute that to me not hiding in my booze shadow anymore...It's scary to tell old friends who may not understand. I'm so glad your friends are supportive :)
