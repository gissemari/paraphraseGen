Well I have paused long and hard looking at that title and thinking: oh maybe you think the badge is to blame for your relapse so that is shifting blame from yourself to something else but really your self is to blame? Don't blame the badge numbnuts!..Last time round the badge took forever to climb out of single digits. Around the 30 day mark I stopped coming here daily because I didn't even want to even *see* the word 'drink'...Anyways I popped back every now and then until one day I saw my badge was 97 days... wow coming up to **triple** digits! ..A week later a big trigger sent me ballistic and I hit that poison...Somewhere in my mind I think that knowing I had over a 100 days dry under my belt made me too confident in my sobriety and that contributed to a relapse...So I'm thinking I'm gonna try this again without a day count. I know roughly when I stopped so I think that will work for me...If I doing this wrong please do tell ;-)..And yay nice to say I will not drink with any of you good folk here at SD.

I'm not using a badge either. I want to take each day as it comes and live in the moment. I know that's the best approach for me and may not be so for others...Glad you're able to have 100 (!!) days under your belt which I'm sure contributed to your decision to try this approach this time around. I will not drink with you today day whatever of a lot more!
For me I feel it's hard to make an endless goal for myself. I love numbers. I love goals. I love attainable quantifiable goals. It's how I am motivated. 
All that matters is that we won't drink today!
