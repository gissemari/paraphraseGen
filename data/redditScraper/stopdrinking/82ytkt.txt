Hi guys I'm new as of yesterday so I'm  on day 2. Will it get easier? I'm close to losing my husband I'm so anxious my apartment is a mess and I'm in NYC so alcohol is everywhere. I'm trying to head to a meeting in an hour but I'm struggling. I feel like I won't be able to live forever like this.....Edit: thank you all so much for the words of encouragement. Each one of you helped me get up and go to a meeting. For me that's a huge deal I've never gone. I'm really hurting because I just got out of a 30 day detox/rehab so my body hates me. I'm trying to be kind to myself today...By the way since I just did rehab will I recover faster? Thanks again!

Yes. The first week is hell. It takes time but eventually you will acclimate to an alcohol-free life and not drinking will seem perfectly normal. I know it's hard to conceptualize that right now but it WILL happen if you stick with it. The anxiety goes away too. Hang in there.
Yes it really does. You'll still have moments &amp; days (I kind of am today!). But you won't feel anything like you do right now. The trick is to remember that you'll never get to experience the "next phase" if you don't make it through this one. I'm excited to see what 90 days feels like. Sometimes that's the some thing that gets me through a day. Stick with it &amp; you'll start feeling the benefits roll in!!
it gets better.
My badge is day 2 but I'm really on day 3. Today is already so much easier. It's not perfect. I was tempted last night. My situation is different because my SO has been as bad as me. I'm sure the stress of that doesn't help but try your best to be patient with him pain also. You have to take care of you first but understand it's harder for others not to be able to help "fix" our problems. Just remember you are two days stronger!
If you drink again it'll get worse.   Guaranteed. 
It definitely gets better.  Just focus on today. Hang in there.
Do you have a sponsor? I know that for me finding a sponsor who was big on the big book and working the steps as soon as possible was the key for me. Ive tried so many times to get sober by just going to meetings and sitting there for an hour and then going home... It just didnt work. It wasnt enough for me.
Hang in there! You can do this. Just keep it simple. One day at a time. Whenever I am tempted I tell myself to sleep on it. I can always start drinking tomorrow. Then when I wake up I feel so happy and good that I didn't drink. Like everyone here says you will never wake up and regret NOT drinking. Please keep checking in here as often as you need to. Let us know how you are doing! 
It will get so much easier! Stick around here! It'll be out of your body at 10 days so you're really in the worst of it right now.
Hey there I just reset my badge yesterday so Im also on day 2. Please let me know if you want to talk. 
Yes! It does! Keep going out of curiosity if nothing else... you'll see how much better you'll feel without all those toxins in you body very soon... and you'll be so proud of yourself!
It certainly feels easier for me now than it did in the first few days back in December. I think once you notice the positives it does become easier for me it's not spending half the weekend drunk or asleep whilst it's been easier for me to lose weight as well.
It doesn't just get easier....It gets better too!
Yes. It gets much much easier over time. 
Yup - it gets a lot easier. I found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2sf5jm/my_attempt_at_an_alcohol_recovery_timeline/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/36cgmh/faq_timelines/) helpful and motivating :). ..Hang in there red.
It's already so much better for me!
