I've been going to AA meetings for about two years but up until recently haven't been following the standard advice - read the big book get a sponsor and work the steps.  I had about 5 months of sobriety this spring and summer but fell off the wagon in a big way.  After the first relapse I got a sponsor but didn't really take advantage of his advice or time.  ..In the last month I have been meeting with him and he indicated that my relapses are a step 1 problem.  I have used the Hazelden worksheets and did a step one inventory.  On paper it's quite clear that I qualify as being powerless over alcohol and having an unmanageable life.  ..However I can't get it straight in my head.  There's a part of me that believes that I can control my drinking but there are many cases I can cite to prove the opposite including a 3 day bender last week.  ..I've always heard that the first step is the only one that you have to get absolutely right.  Any advice on working step 1?

I always remember my last drunk. While not spectacular in any way I do remember how I felt and tell myself that I never want to feel like that again
I've been "playing the tape forward" for the past 4.5 months at times multiple times a day. Whenever I get the urge to drink I logically follow through in my mind what the end result is going to be which is me unable to stop drinking. Once I take a drink I have no power over when I stop.
