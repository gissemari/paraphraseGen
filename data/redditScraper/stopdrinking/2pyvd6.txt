If you do enough searching (go to Saturday Shares) you will find lots of stories of use and abuse.  ..The great risk with asking for other peoples' using history is that we as alcoholics/addicts are prone to comparing ourselves **away** from recovery.  By that I mean that we hear what other people did or the amounts they used and say..."I'm not nearly as bad as that guy/girl.  Therefore I must not have a problem...."  Be careful if you find yourself thinking that way.  That kind of thinking added 10 miserable years to my drinking career...Good luck..   .   ..|Score|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|----|---|----|.|19|Nika65|*Did any of you entirely skip holiday events when you were newly sober?

Not many people are that lucky especially when there's a car accident involved. I'm one of those lucky ones too. On October 23 of 2013 I ran my car into a house with a BAC of .26. Here's what I did. ..I moped for two months. I isolated and drank on my own. There was no where further down I could go. I had no car so I'd walk to get my booze. I got fired from my job. When I went to parties I was blacked out by the time I got there. I lost two months of my life. December 23rd of last year I got into a physical fight with my mother when she tired of my hiding and isolating tipped my last bottle of Jack Daniels down the sink. As I slammed the door in her face absolutely disgusted with her thinking "why the hell would she even fucking care" I realized that I had to stop. ..That doesn't have to be you and your story. The legal stuff will work itself out. What we have done is what we have done and there's no changing it. What *can* be done exists in you. You have recognized that something needs to change. That's wonderful. ..There's a wonderful chat in the sidebar--> over there for when anyone feels weak or lonely or happy or just wants to talk. There's AA SMART recovery and other resources that will help you to go through this process with *others* because you most certainly are not alone. What worked for me was making a decision to not drink now going to AA and gathering around me a sober group of people who give a shit about me. ..I wish you all the luck in the world.

I don't drink because I said I wasn't going to drink anymore.  That's it. I have never had another reason. Other reasons can be argued with. It sounds like you quit because you wanted your life to improve.  You don't feel it's going as you expected and your addict brain has already seized that and is running with it.  The same thing would have happened if your life DID improve. It would be "I wanted my life to improve it did I can drink again." That's how this works...So first yeah reasons are bad. But also notice what else is going on here.  You think you want to drink again because your life isn't great.  But you'd think that same thing even if your life was going well. Your reason is a red herring. It ain't the real reason. Don't waste too much time on it.  ..Taking alcohol away leaves a void. That void needs to be filled.

The last time I did it was after 104 days of sobriety. It was so easy I convinced myself that I wasn't an alcoholic after all and surely I could drink in moderation now. So I had a six-pack. Two weeks later I did the same. One week later I did it again. Not long after I was back to a six-pack/day. Then I spent 2 years chasing this elusive moderation fantasy. It was frustrating and exhausting trying to limit myself count days until I could drink again and live up to the little rules I had to create for myself.
