I'm proud of everyone posting and lurking here. It tells a lot about our relationships with ourselves that we've recognized a problem exists and want to either identify it or suppress it. Whether we're going through the anxiety and guilt that accompanies those relapsed/relapsing or we're going through the struggles of cravings it screams of strength to me that you come back here share react read learn and most importantly grow. ..We don't need luck where we're going or with what we're doing today. We need to find confidence to know that we're not going to succumb and our resolve for even just today is stronger than the addiction that surrounds us. Keep kicking ass.
