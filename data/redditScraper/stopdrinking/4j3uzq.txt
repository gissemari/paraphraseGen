Hey friends!..So I just got my sober days marker/flair/thing and i feel like its a tangible start so i just wanted to thank the reddit for that! I been struggling and failing a lot but i think ive been failing less and less and may be on the brink of making really good progress..I just sometimes get overwhelmed with the thought of having to live life without something to help me deal through it and was wondering any ideas to help me in those moments when i just feel like i need to drink. ..I think im going to start talking to my therapist about this and stuff because i made a realization today. i started having a problem with alcohol after i got hospitalized for being suicidal. Up till then I only drank on holidays and very little so i was pretty much sober living... but i was miserable every day and knew i was going to kill myself. i couldnt take life anymore and i decided to do it. but ended up in hospital instead after a friend talked me out. ..thing is i never dealt with the fact that i didnt know how to deal with life. and i just drank. .so i never had a coping mechanism..and like i feel this is a huge realization and i just wanted to share that..and ask how others overcame the fear of not having alcohol to rely on when they cant deal with life?..Thanks!..edit: still kinda confused how spacing in reddit works edited in a few more spaces to make sentences clearer

I think that is a good realization to have. I think too that you are trying to conceptualize how to stay sober forever but that is a hard question to answer... I personally don't know how to deal with life either but it is easier for me to deal with life today when I remember to instead of worrying about life in general...I don't know if that helps. I know a lot of us struggle with depression as well as problems with alcohol. ..Best of luck on your journey.
Hey there. I wanted to let you know you are not alone on the fear thing! Besides the other 25 emotions I have coursing through my veins fear is #1 for me. The big thing for me not to drink and I'm only going to worry about today. And then when I wake up I will make another daily pledge not to drink tomorrow..All the best
