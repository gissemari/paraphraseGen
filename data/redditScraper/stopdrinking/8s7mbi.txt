It's been a week since I've been sober after relapsing from a month of sobriety and I am not sure if i'm actually experiencing withdrawals or my mind is playing tricks on me. My eyes feel heavy and drowsy my abdomen hurts and I don't feel like I have any energy. Anxiety has also been really bad for the last few days. I don't feel the urge to drink and my sleeping pattern has been fine until now with a few weird dreams here and there. Can someone help me out? Am I just overthinking and making a big deal out of nothing? Thank you in advance :)

That doesn't sound like anything terribly out of the ordinary for detox week.....'Kindling' can mean that the withdrawal symptoms get worse every time you go through it unfortunately!..If you're concerned or the pain is really bad or it persists it's always a good idea to have a checkup with a doctor.....Hope you feel better soon!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
It may just be a crappy week and nothing to do with the booze. We all have them. 
It took about 2 weeks for my anxiety to drop. I didn't trust myself at first..You could do more relaxation stuff to see if that helps?
