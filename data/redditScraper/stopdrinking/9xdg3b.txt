So this is my first shot at quitting.  The long awaited 30 days is upon me.  I find it to be a good feeling but I still have many odd feelings.  I have a large fear of failing and the results of said failure.  I am still fighting through DUI issues and the fiscal hardships associated with it.  My relationship with my ex is still somewhat alive (we broke up due to her father becoming terminally ill and me being in another state). I find myself isolating for the most part but I had my bandmate over last night which was nice.  I just am far less social than before.  Lost weight. No more palpitations fear of smelling like booze far fewer anxiety attacks and more sleep.  I can hang around others drinking and have turned down booze several times and even went to a bar to eat and watch The Flyers.  Life seems somewhat better but the future is terrifying.  A lot has to unfold and with that being said it creates a lot of uneasiness that kinda sours the celebratory aspect of sobriety.  BUT I shall move forward and keep reading this sub.  I find so much strength in these testimonials and seeing the similarities in issues I'm having really helps calm me down when I'm feeling hopeless.  Thank you SD and all of you still struggling and those who have found what works for you.  The combination between the two create such an amazing team of individuals suited to assist any and all types of people wishing to stop drinking. I love you all and thank you for not drinking with me! Let's do another 24 hours!

I myself face DUI issues I let go too far I'm also in a band. I feel that worry man I really do. I had urges yesterday but I feel much better today. Never know what tomorrow may bring. But keep reading this sub! I'm reaching day 5 tonight and it feels great! So much energy. Its good you're losi g weight have you considered intense cardio or lifting weights? Personally I felt a lot of anger and the exercise is benefical. Time to get ripped. I'm on that caffeine nicotine and burning mode everyday now. Hope to get rid of that nicotine someday but there are larger issues at hand. Good luck you got this!! IWNDWYT
