Without any interesting context ie. the party or friends alcohol is boring as fuck. I couldn't walk as straight and couldn't focus as well. The buzzed feeling wasn't so enjoyable that I'd want to constantly induce it. I neither hated it nor loved it but preferred the clarity of mind before I downed the drink. It was just boring. And the ethanol ruined a perfectly good coke &gt;:( ...Good luck to all those struggling.

Thank you for sharing! Glad it stopped with just one. 3 years is amazing!!!
After three years I'm curious why you would even consider drinking? ..I say that because I am convinced I have a chronic disease that goes into remission but is never gone. Do you believe the same?
Drinking a glass or three was always boring. That's why I am addicted to it to begin with. Because I needed many others to start having fun. And that's why I know I can never moderate. 
Thanks for sharing.
