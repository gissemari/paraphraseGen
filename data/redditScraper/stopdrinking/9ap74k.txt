The last three weeks have been messy. I started drinking and the subsequent binging made me gain 15 pounds. I did that thing where I drunkenly feel like messaging people I shouldn't at night and have to wake up to the embarrassment/unwillingness to continue those dialogues. However one thing I did do while drunk was tell someone in the politest way possible to F off. This was someone who was slowly ghosting me in the most aggravating way possible ie. never bothering to respond and when they did it was like 'sorry I've been so busy' without asking me any questions or wanting to follow-up. So drunk me wished them well and sober me is now coming to terms with that decision. Has anyone ever experienced something like that? anyways my goodness is being sober ever better. Here is to waking up clear. iwndwyt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Hey belladonna welcome back.. .For me being sober required me to think more clearly and logically about the way I *reacted* to situations whether they were good or bad....When I cut off friendships while still drinking it never ended well because my head was always in a fog. I've never reignited most of those friendships....When I cut off friendships in sobriety I was thinking clearly; I thought deeply about why I didn't want to pursue the friendship and how it would affect me / the friend. ...Be being able to reasonably know and understand my feelings I was better able to deal with the emotions without picking up. I had to find another outlet (mine is the gym)....Hope to see more from you!
