I'm approaching my one year (Sep 6th) and was just reminded when I opened my cupboard of what life was like before I quit. I used to drink these $4 energy boosters (a lot) when the "party" was "great" and I needed to stay awake. I needed it often you know once that drunken state came over me.   ..I haven't had one since and I can't possibly fathom the need to drink one ever again.   ..PS - I stay up past midnight every weeknight and super late on weekends. In fact my struggle in today's world is time itself. Sincerely there is so much more I want to do and never enough time in a day to enjoy it all.   ..I will not drink with you today. Or tomorrow. Or any day thereafter. Thank you for being there with me...[5 hour energy](https://imgur.com/gallery/RP2PF)

Congrats on making it so far.  I'm just starting to appreciate all the time and activities open to me in the absence of alcohol-- it's very exciting.  
Nice post. Thank you for saying it.
