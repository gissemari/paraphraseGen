I'm almost at 30 days sober and been thinking about my previous relapses. I found out they made me stronger each time even though I felt much weaker the days following them. I'm happy I was willing to bounce back and give it another try relapsing is not necessary for me in recovery and I don't want to go there anymore. For all serial relapsers don't ever give up you can do this!.. .["Failure usually works for me in the end."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTidn2dBYbY) David Hasselhoff...Have a nice weekend :)..Edit: I didn't relapse but was thinking about it just a word of encouragement to those in this situation .

Thanks for shaving and congrats on the upcoming star!!! Enjoy your weekend! :)
I'm glad you gave it another go too :)
Congratulations! And thanks for the video - what a great way to start the day :)
Great post for all of us. Thanks!!
Yep! Not this time for me. Keep up the good work! 
Thank you for the encouragement this is very helpful to read today!
It was harder this time to get back to quitting. No more relapses. Congrats all around! I will not drink with you today!
I also learned a lot through my past relapses.  Mostly like you that I think I don't need to do that to learn anymore.  All the learning I need to have about drinking can be done...by not drinking.  I'm on track with you and /u/RedHeadedRiot to get that star in a couple of days!
