So I'm fresh off another one. I'm on sober day four and there are a few common things that always happen to me right after a Vodka binge. I was curious if these horrible terrible oh so regrettable things are common:..1) **The Smell!** What exactly is that horrible sour stench? It almost seems as if I've been ingesting poison for a week and my brain is screaming to my pores to do their damn job. Which leads me to.....2) **The Sweat!** This greasy mess of sweat that doesn't drip but instead sticks to every part of my body while ever more comes out my pores. And I'll lump in whatever that gloopy stuff is in my eyes that builds a beach of sand whenever I try to sleep. Speaking of sleep.....3) **The Dreams!** Horrific nightmares full of people (and other more pants-shittingly terrifying things) trying to FUCKING KILL ME. I can't explain to you how...it's like my brain is telling me  you wanna fucking kill yourself? Fine. HAVE SOME.  The brain also feels.....4) **The Burnout!** Just fried to a crisp up there. Can't think straight even though you're technically sober. Can't walk straight even though you're technically sober. Can't concentrate enough to so much as read Reddit on the toilet. Which is really a shame because of.....5) **The Constipation!** For me at least. Might be diarrhea for you (don't worry that still comes for me later). Either way we're gonna be on the damn throne for awhile. It is the absolute worst. I think I'm going out like Elvis every single time. Now I know what having a baby feels like. And speaking of babies.....6) **Just kidding!** Why oh why do we keep doing this to ourselves? Well not today my friends. ..Not today...That's all I got!

Hey there I'm on day 2. All of these things are happening to me today and I'm also struggling with my nerves burning which is probably neuropathy and not a good sign at all. If I can make it to Wednesday I never have to feel this way again so just trying to hang in there and get through it. Tonight is the night I will soak my sheets and have shitty dreams but  IWNDWYT!
**7) The Feeling of Being Poisoned** This has definitely been a big catalyst for my sobriety. I don't get normal "headache and nausea" hangovers anymore. I literally feel like someone (me!) has slipped me some horrible poison the day after. Really really awful feeling.
I always call it the 3 S's shits shakes and sweats. Ugh it's awful.
Ugh.. I'm saving this to read when I get cravings. I just went through all of this as I'm on day 3. Worst shakes I've ever had at work yesterday had to hide my hands from co workers when I was grabbing things. I'll stay sober with you today every minute of sweating tonight is one step closer to freedom.
Saving this post as a reminder of the things I don't want to experience yet again.
Thanks for posting this. I came very close to relapsing (45 days without a drink) this weekend.  I need to remember what it's like and this helps.
