Well as the title says I'm 4 years sober today. If you had asked me if I'd have made it this far on 2-1-12 I'd have told you you were crazy. As it happens though I made up my mind with a little guidance from a court appointed substance abuse counselor on the following day 2-2-12. From then on alcohol never stood a chance. ..The phrasing makes it seem like this has been a knock-down drag-out fight but it hasn't. Sure I struggled the first year like nearly all of us do. The 2 after that had their flair ups where I'd have to remind myself of what it took to get sober. The subtle thoughts of "if it was this easy maybe you never had a problem" were the worst but still easily out reasoned. ..This past year though has been different. I haven't struggled. I haven't been forced to outthink my alcoholic brain...I go to bars with friends and family as the all-time DD. I eat and order a coke like usual and watch everyone around me do what they usually do. My sober life has just become my life. My sobriety is the status quo. ..This is only ever challenged when I meet someone who doesn't know I don't drink. It's funny watching them try to wrap their heads around the concept of me an alcoholic in a bar not drinking. ..Many people will consider what I do as dangerous but it's not. Not really anyway because I don't have to fight against the status quo any more. ..I mostly lurk around here these days so shout outs to OTR raevie and the others I'm undoubtedly missing that were there when I needed them most. Thanks and good luck to you all.
