I haven't drank since July 15th and honestly it hasn't been THAT tough until now. I am really missing the social aspect of drinking. I miss sitting around with friends and the atmosphere becoming more drunk at the night goes on. And I keep thinking "maybe since I had the self control to stop I'll have the self control to drink in moderation like a normal person". I am only 22 and a part of me is really bummed that I can't enjoy drinks like everyone else in a responsible way. I think when people hear that I'm an alcoholic they don't take it seriously. I've blacked out more times than not when I've drank which was for 3 years nearly every day. It almost killed me and caused me to try to take my own life. I have a son. I know what's at stake. So why do I still think "maybe I could handle one drink"?

Girl I tried the moderation thing after 18 months and shit-ton of "work" to make me think I could swing it. Nope. I mean I didn't end up as bad as I was before the 18 months but that's just because I knew the whole time I shouldn't be doing what I was doing. You can click my handle to read how it went for me. I posted it 18 or 19 days ago...Have you tried reading This Naked Mind or Alan Carr's "Easy Way"? My first extended sobriety Alan Carr's book had me seriously at a reformed-smoker level of self-righeousness about how people who drank were just misguided. Really it helped me a lot when I started to have thoughts like yours. But I'll admit I'm older and know I've had enough to drink for a lifetime. I bet some of the younger folks on this sub will be a ton of help for you...Anyhow good on you for reaching out. May you find something that gets you another 24 hours! :)
I feel the same way too sometimes. I'm 25 and yeah a lot of social events revolve around alcohol and I would love to just be a normal young person and get drinks on a first date or have red wine at dinner - but at the same time I know that for me alcohol would be the kiss of death. And when I used to drink it'd be fun for the first few hours until I became absolutely obliterated. The good times seldom outweighed the bad times and it's just not worth the risk for me.
