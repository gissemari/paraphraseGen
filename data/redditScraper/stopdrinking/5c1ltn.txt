I broke up my days into tiny bits. Like an hour or so to make it more manageable. I totally get where you are coming from but taking that drink now really does not solve a thing. Once we don't take a drink under pressure it can be seen as a huge victory and it builds stamina. I found that looking at it from that angle made it easier to push through. A lot of smaller steps amount to a huge journey in the end. ..It would not mean a thing if it were easy. Instead of giving in do the exact opposite. Why not go for a run or gym or meditation session? Get your mind of it make a habit of countering negative emotions with constructive actions. Days like these are the foundation for our future. Hang in there I'm not drinking today as well. Hitting the gym in a minute join me in breaking the cycle?
I'm doing the same...my danger zone is 5pm-7pm. Tea tv exercise read color...won't drink with you!.
I'm at 8 days too and also hitting a point where I feel it's getting harder again. Just hang on and let it pass. ..Just think of how much harder it will be to pursue a new career drunk or hungover all the time compared to sober you solving this problem. Alcohol might temporarily numb the pain but it's just putting a bandaid over an infected wound. 
I wish I had a good answer.  The most I can offer is that you're not alone.  A lot of us drink to cover our fears.  From a few wise ones I've met along the way facing them is apparently a better way of dealing.  (Not that I've by any stretch of the imagination mastered that yet).
