Tonight was an interesting night to say the least. Without going into too much detail I'm guessing I said something to one of my family members and what started out as an okay/meh evening (not a bad thing generally just not great) turned into them just flat out ignoring me. The only response I got when I tried to bring up a subject for conversation and then the TV got turned on and they were staunchly ignoring me. Up until this I wasn't aware that anything might have been wrong. It was pretty demoralizing and when I went somewhere else in the house all I could think about was wanting a drink. I struggled with this for a few hours and got pretty depressed as a result and realized that this has happened with relative frequency before and this is the first time I've resisted the urge to go get a drink. I'm on the upswing now and feeling a bit better before I crash out for the night...Stay strong brothers and sisters.

I hope you don't take this the wrong way.  What you're describing sounds a bit like the perceptions of someone with Borderline Personality Disorder.  If you [read this over](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder) and agree you may want to talk with someone. If you don't then I'm wrong. I've been wrong before and I'll be wrong many more times.  I just wanted to mention it because it's something that many folks here never realized affected them at least until someone else said something &amp; they talked to a professional...Great job on staying sober.  Keep on keepin on. 
What great thing to recognize a trigger!  Now you van deal with that trigger easily.
