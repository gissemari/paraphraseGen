I'm 33 years old and have been trying to quit since I was 20. I recently had 9 months of sobriety in 2016 which was absolutely amazing. Since that relapse I've gained 60 pounds and am completely lost I'm ready to give up! The only reason I continue to fight is for my kids but I think sometimes they would be better off if I left them alone. Never thought my life would turn into this.

I'm new to this so I can't give a whole lot of advice other than I won't drink with you today. If I were you I would consider checking into a thirty day rehab. I know that can be a big pill to swallow and might be one of the most difficult things to admit to however it could be one of the best things for you. Have an open mind and stay good friend 
I've sometimes thought my kids would be better off without me. But that is wrong. That was the booze and the loathing and the depression talking. The truth is they are much better off with me they just need the me **without** the booze...Do you have any support network you can reach out to for help? You've recently had 9 months sobriety. That is no small thing. What worked for you last time? What didn't?..I've just stopped being drunk after a 3 month sober stint and before that a 6 month stint. I feel like a jerk and a real piece of shit for getting drunk. I've just been to my first AA meeting reached out to a couple of friends and been reading and posting here. I'm just taking it day by day at the moment. We can do this I wont drink with you today.
