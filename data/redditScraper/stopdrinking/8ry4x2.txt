Super anxious for no particular reason getting urges to drink guess it's time to workout/go on a very long walk till the feelings pass.

Suck dick instead
We all strugle in on our journey to becoming the person we want to be. The important thing is to acknowledge when we take steps backwards and to keep our eyes on the goal. You CAN do it and so can I!
Workouts are always good bit of fresh air and a change of scene often works for me. Either way I hope you feel better soon. I woke up anxious and went for a run its calmed me down a bit. Hope you find a bit of calm too...
