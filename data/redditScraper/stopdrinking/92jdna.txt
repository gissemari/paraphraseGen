The Daily Check-In for Saturday July 28th: Just for today I am NOT drinking!..We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!..Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!..I'm pledging myself to not drinking today no matter what happens good or bad and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others...It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours let's not drink alcohol!..This pledge is a statement of intent...Today we don't set out trying not to drink we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!..What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up...What this is:..A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning...What this isn't:..A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread...This post goes up at:..US Night/Early Morning..Europe Morning..Asia and Australia Evening/Night..A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar....I had lunch with my younger sister today.  She is recently out of a halfway house and is getting her life together for the first time in her adult life (She's 25 I'm 39).  I've always had guilt because I moved out before things got worse with her dad/my stepdad.  I wasn't really around when her struggles began in earnest as a teenager.  She is now working a 12-step program and just got her 5 month chip.  We talked about how time seems to move at different speeds now because we aren't blunting our senses we compared notes on some of our shitty behaviors we talked about things that sobriety doesn't necessarily make better.  I felt closer to her today than I have felt in years.  It was good to see her really see her.  IWNDWYT!..Today marks my last post for the week.  Anybody interested in hosting please reach out.
----------immediate responses--------

I didn't drink in Aus with you today and I won't tonight!..Thanks so much for hosting this week u/msmith83
IWNDWYT 
I've made it to Day 30!  ..Hooray for SD! You've inspired me all the way to a month of sobriety. I can't believe I've done it. ..I am so excited and feeling so much better physically mentally and emotinally than i have in a very long time..I will not drink with you today my friends! 
I'm gonna spend my Saturday with a clear head working on building myself a worthwhile life. IWNDWYT in Chicago!
Well done and thank you IWNDWYT!
IWNDWYT.
Feeling angry confused and sad over some shit with my partner but dealing with it sober is so much easier than dealing with it drunk. IWNDWYT!
IWNDWYT 
One month! I made it a month sober for the first time in 5 years! Wow. Now to drink this water! 
I will not drink with you today
Got thru birthday 47 yesterday without a drop on one of the hottest days in the UK I remember in all those years...makes me realise I've got this...IWNDWYT...
I will not drink with you today 
IWNDWYTD
My team won and I didn't/won't drink today   winning all round!
Doing my first 5k today!! I might collapse after but I will not drink!
It's 11:50 on a Friday night and I'm not sitting on the couch half paying attention to a rerun while browsing Twitter and feeling sorry for myself. Instead I'm puttering around the house doing Mom Shit* while my family sleeps. I love this and I'm gonna keep it up with y'all into Saturday. ..*Folding laundry misting plants refilling the dish soap bottle...can be performed by whatever partner happens to be up the latest. I'm a mom so I'm calling it Mom Shit.  
Love you all and IWNDWYT
Starting today with a parkrun - new (to me) course. IWNDWYT.
I will not drink alcohol today 
Day 2/3 @ a music festival in Derbyshire UK today. One of my fave bands Catfish and the bottleman headlining tonight. IWNDWYT so bring on being sober in a mosh pit haha! Lets have iiiit :)
Morning from Scotland /r/stopdrinking! After a few days of unspeakably hot weather it seems that whatever cosmic deity operates our meteorology realised his mistake and we've been returned to the summer that our country knows and loves - grey skies and rain falling so hard that it leave bruises...I will be watching the landscape slowly sink from the window of a train as I travel down to an all day punk rammy with my partner. An old pal who I haven't seen for many years will be there and I can't wait to see him again! We used to gleefully share stories of getting trashed back in the day but we're both sober now (him for just over a year omg) so it's going to be a new chapter of our friendship. Delighted...Today's day 209 - IWNDWYT!
Hi there SD. It's a beautiful morning. It's a great feeling waking up without a hangover. Day 6 for me.  I'm all in. IWNDWYT:-)
one more day
Good morning fellow sobernauts. I hope everyone has a great day. As per usual: I will not drink with you today...Stay strong this weekend!..  
Hey SD! I'm not drinking today...Wishing you all a beautiful weekend! &lt;3..Thanks again for hosting u/msmith83!.
Up and out in the sun this morning. IWNDWYT.
Good morning from Norway! I will not drink with you today. 
Still sober. IWNDWYT 
A new day one here. I will not drink with you today.
I will not drink anything with alcohol in it today.
I'm in! Saturday is a perfect day to stay alert aware and very in the moment! I've absolutely no plans today so just letting the day unfold with all my brain cells firing properly is going to be a real treat!..IWNDWYT..feather
I have a couple of unavoidable events today where people will be drinking but I'm going to have sparkling water. ..IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT 
Have a few events where people will be drinking today. I'll be enjoying a clear head without alcohol. ..iwndwyt!
Good morning everyone! If feels good making it to an other Saturday having not drank all week! Now today is my niece's birthday and we are off to my sisters house for a barbecue. This will likely mean beer will be on offer. I'm feeling good and strong though right now and am looking forward to drinking refreshing soft drinks. But I also know my feelings can switch very quickly right now and I may find myself tempted. So my plan is to take a nice bottle of a fizzy drink with me so if I get offered beer as soon as I arrive then I can say I have my own drink...I will not drink with you all today   
Iwndwyt!
Day one again. I will not drink with you today.
I will celebrate life by not drinking with you all today.
25 days today here. I feel so refreshed after dinner. Ready to enjoy the evening with some iced coffee. IWNDWYT
Missed my one month mark but I'm one month and three days sober now! IWNDWYT 
Good morning everyone I hope you all have a safe and sober day IWNDWYT 
I am not going to drink today . 
IWNDWYT 
IWNDWYT 
I will not drink today.
I'm in!
I will not drink with you today. Excited tomorrow is double digits! 
The rain has arrived at long last and it is finally much cooler in London . The sweet sweet relief of stepping outside and not being covered in a light sheen of sweat after about 100 metres! Not drinking with you wonderful people today! 
Here.
IWNDWYT
New High Score!   .  .I ended my last 110 day streak with a night out at the bar for a work meeting... Tried to set rules on my drinking after that (take as many days off as drinks had... Only drink once a week... Etc..) which just lead to "Well if I'm only gonna drink x numbers of times per week I may as well make it worthwhile" and proceed to get black out...  .  .Happy that I've made it this far. I can't say that I won't ever drink again - Just that I won't drink again until I know that I can control it and not let it control me. I haven't gotten there yet - And so I will not drink with you today :)
I will not drink today
Really starting to get the hang of being sober. My anger restlessness and anxiety are all decreasing slowly and I'm actually starting to enjoy alone time and family time again. I feel like I'm changing and calming down more each day. I'm very glad and lucky to not be drinking with you all today. 
Count me in :)
Life is grand minus the poison ivy. I will not drink today SD!
Thanks u/msmith83 I will not drink with you today!
I'm looking forward to a hard workout this morning after my coffee. **I will not drink with you today!**
4 days.
Good morning.  Not drinking today 
I will not drink today .
I will not drink today.
I will not drink today SD!
I'm heading out for a 6 mile training run shortly. It won't be fun but I will get it done and at least the weather has cooled off. IWNDWYT.
Happy Saturday fellow sobernauts! My house gets inspected today for the sale. I don't think the inspector will find anything major but it's nerve wracking. Meanwhile my plan is to work all day and get caught up. Work is kicking my ass as it has been for the last 6 weeks. I bought a book on Amazon this past week "Hiking the North Shore" and have it near my desk. End of the month and beginning of new when we have to transmit our financials to national is the hardest. I just have to get through this next week and then can breath and can plan to go hiking on the north shore next weekend. ..Thanks u/msmith83 for checking us in all week. I will not drink with you today. 
I will not drink today.
No drinking here!
I had a good day yesterday. So good I missed check in. Today should be just as good. But I got up earlier just to check in. Tomorrow well I have high hopes for that too so just in case I promise IWNDWY on Sunday either. *Welp* that covers *my* weekend. I hope yours is covered too.
Checking in on day 24. Made it passed Friday night. I had a few cravings but redirected myself with other activities...I love this sober life so much better. I can see how you and your sister really got to enjoy a true moment. Alcohol  the magic wonder fluid that can make you happy give you great relationships  make you the life of the party etc. etc.. I have been really watching the advertisements for this stuff . What a huge puff of smoke LIE. It is poison no matter what label you put on it. Sending good wishes to all- Stay strong all. Love you all and thank you for the support!..I will not drink with you today.
I'm in I'm not drinking with everybody today  
Checking in this sunny Saturday. Not drinking with you all today :-)

I will not drink today 
I will stay free from alcohol today.
I've stayed up until 2am every night for the past three weeks to watch the Tour de France from Australia. Two nights to go. So glad I'm not drinking or I would a) not be able to deal with the sleep deprivation b) not remember the stages the next day or c) be passing out halfway through each stage! IWDWYT
IWNDWYT - bless you all! Much love 
So I was looking all over for the Sunday check in. I'll be darned it's Saturday. I WILL not drink with you today this  SATURDAY.
I will not drink today!! I will go attend a face-to-face meeting of some sort to get support.
Coming up on my one month (again)! Feels different this time. Feels right instead of forced. ..I won't drink with ya'll today  
Made it through Friday after work social.  Closing in on 30 days!  IWNDWYT!
I will not drink today. I'm just glad I have today and tomorrow off from work. That job is the worst working experience of my 39 years of existence.
Happy Saturday. IWNDWYT
My life is better without booze. Iwndwyt but I'm about to go serve bloody marys and mimosas to hungover people. It's much easier to do when you aren't hungover yourself.
Last night I didn't get enough sleep and I think I woke up in the middle of a REM cycle. When I woke up I felt intensely tired and it reminded me of feeling hungover. Thankfully that feeling went away quickly. IWNDWYT.
Morning everyone! IWNDWYT! 
I will not drink today!
Had a good night's sober sleep and want that for tomorrow. I will not drink no matter what. 
Haven't checked in for a long time. Still sober still visiting here often. iwndwyt
40 love round numbers. Got to say this is the longest I've gone and SD has been a huge part. The stories just like mine the ones that are worse the ones that are less the ones that are different all of them give me the feeling that I'm not alone. So thank you whoever reads this little block of text from a stranger. You're part of making my life a little better. I hope yours too. ..IWNDWYT
I will not drink today. I will work on a few chores around the house and be the best person I can be just for today. Thank you 
Today in Vegas with my 3 days or so I will not drink with you.
Didn't drink last night - first Friday in god knows how long - instead I baked banana bread danced to 90s pop and watched a movie. Today my friend is hosting a cocktail party day drinking event which my boyfriend and roommate are going to but I'm thinking I'll take advantage of the great weather to bike to the farmer's market and get fruits veggies and sunflowers. IWNDWYT!
One year ago today I drank too much wine ended up with my head in the toilet and decided to "take a break." The "break" continues today - I will join you all in not drinking today or tonight.  
Started off the morning early with a 10 mile run. First day of a 3 weeks vacation. Going to spend the day packing for my upcoming backpacking/road trip. And going to pound seltzer water. Because fuck running in 95% humidity but fuck trying to hydrate with beer even more. 
I will not drink with you today.     
i will not drink with you today.
Wow slept late today. As long as it's not hungover sleep it's good. I will not drink today.
So grateful I made it through Friday night with relative ease. I'm coming up with a plan for the rest of the weekend. I got into a nasty fight with my husband last night which is making all of this a little more difficult but I know drinking will not help. I will not drink with you today!
Well done all of you and have a wonderful day - I won't be drinking with you today!
Not drinking with you all today.
I will not drink with you today.
Blue leader standing by. 
IWNDWYT....Peace and Sobriety All!
Up early here in AZ. I love Saturday early morning might be my new favorite time of the week. IWNDWYT 
IWNDWYT 
I will not drink with y'all today!
Way too much fun stuff going on today so glad I'm not hungover. And I won't be tomorrow either. IWNDWYT.
Good morning. Slept in and lounging in bed. When I feel like it I'll get up and get my coffee eggsand bacon going. Later I'll go to the gym. My day is wide open. I love Saturday mornings. I will not drink today or ever again. 
I will not drink today!
Hello from Australia. Today I didn't drink and I'm working towards finding sober things to do that are different from watching Netflix at my house. So my boyfriend and I went to see a film at a newish independent cinema and it was great. I could definitely see myself rekindling my love of film and cinema going. I got a bit sad when we stopped by my old fave craft beer store to get him a fancy beer.. but although I miss beer I am feeling better every day without it.. IWNDWYT.
I will not drink with you today
Will not drink today.  
I will not drink with you all today!.
Not drinking today!
Hello fellow sobernauts!  IWNDWYT
I loved your posts this week! Thank you for hosting. I'm glad you had that time with your sister. I feel like these are things my brother may think of me now that I'm sober. ..On another note- only a few more days of NATIONAL ICE CREAM MONTH...I will allocate my once-alcohol calories appropriately this weekend! IWNDYT!
Going to make some mikes this morning on the trail. There's a touch of Fall with leaves falling everywhere nicer temps. Nice day to be sober! I will not drink with y'all today! 
Forty days and forty nights sober!  I will not drink today! ..https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WN-wZ6gdchc
Six hundred days without a drink. A few years ago I would have thought that was impossible. Hell I would have considered it some kind of cruel punishment. Now I see it as the blessing it truly is. IWNDWYT.
Glorious sober morning soberniks!  IWNDWYT 
Not today. Not today. Not today!!!!!!!
I will not drink with you today. Great job hosting this week msmith!
Up early cup of coffee and vape in hand. Day 20 is looking good. Last night was very difficult to not drink
Wow u/msmith83 what a touching post about your sister. Thanks for sharing. I'm so warmed to read how well you're both doing and wish you love and deep connection with her...I do not drink; therefore I will not drink with you today.
I will not drink today.
It's my first checkin! Today I'm getting a pedicure with my sister continuing to declutter and organize my house (which is helping me to do the same to my mind) and have a NA meeting planned for 7pm! With help from my sister and bf my bedroom looks like an adult bedroom (mostly) and I slept until 7am!! My face isn't as red or puffy and I don't even need eye drops! IWNDWYT! Go us!!
I choose to stay away from wine today I will not cave in...                              
I will not drink with you today because I do not drink. Change of plan for today but trying to roll with it. Have a good weekend everyone!
A lot of fun planned today. No time to drink no desire to drink not gonna drink.   
I will not drink with you today!
good morning fine folks! So pleased to be joining you all in today's journey. IWNDWYT!!!

Coffee cheers to all of you! IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT 
22 Wahoo! And I will not drink with you today. Stay strong!
IWNDWYT  
30 days today! It feels really good. Gone are the days waking up feeling like shit and reaching for a bottle to function. First time in 3 years that I've gone more than a few days without drinking!!!..I will not drink with you today! 
today i am grateful for determination. ..i will not drink with you today.

It's nice to enjoy a breezy morning in the shade. I will not drink with y'all today!
Just finished work and it's nearly time for bed. I will not drink with you today.
Good Saturday morning all from the Mississippi Gulf Coast.  I will not be drinking with you today! 
I will not drink with y'all today!
Woke up at 3:30AM yesterday and flew with my wife and two boys to the Pacific Northwest.   Then drove us 3 hours to a remote cabin in the mountains.  It was hard but not as hard as walking away from the wine / beer case at the little store down the road was last night...Instead of drinking with my wife on the porch under the stars my wife went to bed early and I stayed up with my oldest son teaching him to play pool.    We were all in bed asleep by 9:00pm.   Forgot to look at the stars but we'll hit that tonight.  Sober...I won't drink today.
Been a while since I checked in but I'm still going strong. Love y'all! 
Going to a wedding today and we all know how those are. Excited to be the one that remembers everything and to get my dance on and to wake up in the morning not hungover! I will not drink with you today!
Around the world in 80 days!  Or just to work and back...regardless I will not drink any alcohol on this day of the journey.  
Enjoy the day. IWNDWYT
Day 27: I will not drink with you today.
Good morning! Woke up feeling great with no addictive poison in my body! Instead of nursing a hangover I'll be helping my boyfriend with some yardwork before heading  to my friend's wedding this evening. Excited to be clear-headed and healthy during the wedding reception- shirley temple here I come! :) 
How very sweet.  Thanks for sharing and hosting.  I won't drink with you today. 
I will not drink today. 
I will not drink with you today!
Day 2 the anxiety is serious. 
&gt; really see her...Really beautiful words here. IWNDWYT!
9 days in. 
Not drinking today!
Happy Sober Saturday all!!!..IWNDWYT!
IWNDWYT on my day 3 here yesterday I actually read a book and it felt great because I hadn't done that in a while. I have a few more to read as well to keep myself preoccupied. ..Have a wonderful day everyone  
I'm with a lot of you on here. I have been sober for over 1 month. A couple days ago I was at (The last  ) Warped Tour and my buddy and I were waiting in the pit for Simple Plan. I was cracking jokes and we even started a  Sound Check  chant that went through the whole pit. The stage hands fucking loved it and couldn't stop laughing as they were getting the instruments ready for the band...After a couple minutes of being a goofball my buddy told the people enjoying my  show  that  AND IF YOU THINK THIS IS BAD THIS IS HIM 100% SOBER! ..One guy grabbed his girlfriend and said  See! I told you! I fucking knew it! ..I yelled  HELL YEAH! Over one month sober baby!  And high fived anyone in arms distance. People were fucking ecstatic for me. They shared my joy in being sober. I joined this subreddit the day I was hungover for the last time and I even put it back one day from then when I was officially sober because I had been drinking late into the night. This is the first time I'm posting. I doubt you all will see it. I'll be posting more though. This is my daily checkup now! Thanks folks! You all are so inspiring!
I won't let the liquor win today. I will not drink! 
No drinking today or the next 24hrs.
I'm not drinking today.  u/AntsyAngler pointed out my flair and I had to see what the angels said about it:..&gt;Angel Number 939 is a message for you to let go of any situations in your life that are no longer serving a positive purpose. Push aside limiting beliefs that hold you back in any way and take control of what you wish to make of your life. Look to more suitable alternatives that will enhance your life and your spiritual path. Do not cling to situations out of fear and do not allow any negative aspects to hinder or stop you. ..It really fits for some stuff that's going on for me but I think it's generally great advice for anyone!  Blessings on your weekend. (FWIW I'm really not very woo-woo really but I love horoscopes tarot angel numbers stuff like that; I frequently find they reflect eerily well what's going on in my life...) 
Second Sober Saturday!  ..IWNDWYT
Im stressed out but no idea why. Whatever i will not drink today :)
Saturday morning with a clear head after a long hard week at work and a little more remote work to go. It's a refreshing feeling to go to sleep with physical and mental exhaustion no alcohol haze. ...Coffee and breakfast in the morning some productivity (after just a week the weight loss improvement in skin and diet are noticeable). Not always easy but I'm feeling it and I will not drink today...
Fuck drinking and letting it ruin my relationships and life... not drinking today... my mess is still salvagable thank GOD for that... IWNDWYT
Not drinking today. 
Reached out to an old friend who I recently heard was getting sober. Nervous to hear back but if not with her I'll just not drink with y'all :) Happy Saturday! 
Good morning SD. I will not drink with you today
The birds outside chirping away outside my window don't drink.  They feel the sunshine on their backs as I do.   I'm not drinking with them today.  
I will not drink with you today.
Hello SD I won't be drinking with any of you today!  
I've gained almost 5 pounds since quitting which is a lot (and very noticeable) when you're under 120. Fuck this so much I'm hungry all the time. I've also been waking up with headaches which makes no sense to me. Ugh I just want to get over the hunger and weird cravings and be healthy again. 
IWNDWYT
I *will not* drink with you today!
Thanks for hosting msmith! It sounds like you and your sister have a good bond...I will not drink today no matter what happens good or bad.
I will not drink you today!
IWNDWYT    
115 days today and went to a great meeting this am. Got a lot done by 1pm! 
Day Two. IWNDWYT.
IWNDWYT!   
I will not drink or use today 
Still here still sober! ..I don't have internet at home so I haven't posting much...IWNDWYT.
IWNDWYT
Not drinking today. 
 I won't drink today 
Going through alcohol withdrawal symptoms and feeling like hell but I will not drink today. 
I will not drink today no matter what my alcoholic mind can come up with to justify it.
I almost slipped last night-- but didn't. Checking in for the next 24.
IWNDWYT!
Luckily there's no 24-hour liquor store near me last night was arduous. But nonetheless I made it through. Today I'll maybe play some tennis with the wife. Another day down another day for the betterment of myself.
I can't believe how much money I have saved. There's actually some let's over at the end of the month after my usual savings contribution. Get in! Here's to another day ladies and gentlemen. 
Morning all. IWNDWYT...Side note: were did everyone's badges go?
Decided to spend my not hungover morning doing yard work and cleaning. Keeping up with the little things like household chores when sober is so much easier...I'm not drinking with you this weekend. 
Just like last Saturday... I will not drink today!!!!!
IWNDWYT 
Day 1 for me. It's been on the cards for a while and I'm actually excited about it! There's too many things I want to do in my life that drinking is preventing me from doing. Today I'm going to hit the gym and make hot sauce. IWNDWYT!
It's Day 1 for me again. Time to do better. ..I'm having a good day so far and I'm looking forward to a steak for supper. ..IWNDWYT
Came super close to buying a bottle of champagne for hubby and I as we celebrate our anniversary.  But I didn't.   And I won't drink with you guys tonight!  
Drank a couple glasses of wine yesterday so I'm starting over.  It's weird because I only ever have one or two drinks but when I do I feel guilty about it the whole next because I really do intend to fully quit.  Oh well no drinking today!
I went totally off the rails last night but recommitting myself today to trying to get sober. Here goes Day 1 (again). IWNDWYT!!
IWNDWYT. I love seeing the days on my badge keep climbing!
2 months for me today and in all the excitement I nearly forgot to check in!!! IWNDWYT 
Not drinking today
I will not drink with you today.  Fuck alcohol.
I will not drink with you today.
IWNDWYT 
I will not drink today.
Day one. I finally made the decision to stop. It took a year of me thinking it over and rationalizing my behavior. I stopped for a month in January and thought I had it all under control. Of course it took yet another massive mistake on my part to set me on the right course but I'm finally here. IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT!
43 months alcohol free! I won't blow it tonight. 
Another great day. .I will not be drinking with you today and I will never drink again and I will never change my mind. 
Barbeques 1 year old birthday party hot weather - there's 99 reasons to drink today  but I'm not giving into any of them...IWNDWYT!
Been a few weeks now :D 
I will not drink with you today!
Good evening everyone 4 days was my previous record the other week but I'm just about to go into my 8th day straight now did think a little this morning about having a beer but that small little voice is getting easier to drown out thank you everyone

Lying in a tent on a Welsh hillside sober for my 6th day in a row. The weather has broken after a UK hot spell and now its raining cats and dogs! Perfect camping weather.   I think it's some kind of metaphor for me coming to a crisis point in my drinking. ..My Brother and his wife are in the tent next door having come especially to see me which is wonderful but I feel so guilty as they had to come so far out their way to see me and are now stuck on a soaking hillside with a 6hr drive back home tomorrow. I guess they must love me very much. I feel so lucky...My feelings are all over the place and I have to face work Monday and deal with HR and occupational health etc about my drinking problem. Fun times :/..At least if my tent does not leak overnight that will be something!..IWNDWYT
Today is Sunday here in Asia. It's the morning. I will not drink today! Today is the start of a new week and I'm going to make it the best one in a long time! Clean and alive.
IWNDWYT :)
I forgot to check in this morning so I'm doing it now!  I got up early this morning for an 8:30am meeting and then ended up venturing out for craft supplies and a trip to the speciality pet store (got a new toy for the pup) and then went to the movies to see Blindspotting (awesome!!!!).  I will not drink with you guys for the rest of today which for me will end in like an hour once I venture to bed because I'm exhausted from a full day of great sober activities! 
Spending this weekend with vidya no alcohol. 
Well here I am on my 29th day. This is actually my 5th Sunday in a row waking up fresh without a hangover. I'd like to say I'm getting up and attacking this day but I'm taking it easy watching some tv and keeping warm. ..I hope everyone is enjoying their weekend. ..IWNDWYT .
won't drink today
I'm struggling right now to not have a drink. Saturday with the friends who are all drinking is very tough. But I'm here and I'm pledging that I won't do it. Playing the tape forward really helps and I'm 17 days I'm which I'm so happy about. I can do this :)
Great day today day-hiked a marathon through the Teton mountains. Though I've done this before as a drinker it was so much better this time and I finished so fast I had time and energy leftover to run all over the yard with my son. Have a wonderful evening everybody.

Here and still sober! 
Technically in time for Saturday!..Actually was at a social thing where I didn't drink. Just hanging out with friends but I almost always have 2-3 drinks at their place. Never enough to make me impaired while driving (we usually stay quite late and I cut myself off early) but a couple  cause it was fun. Water and crystal light again. Going good. 
Another weekend of dd  ng for my friends.  Fun for me and fun for them!  IWNDWYT!
Sunday morning here already so my Saturday is done.
hope everybody is having or had a great weekend!!..**IWNDWYT** ..=\]
Good morning from Scotland!..So uh hey stopdrinking. I'm back. I hit 60 days on June 1. To be honest those 60 sober days completely changed my relationship with alcohol. After that I decided to moderate with the condition that if I ever woke up to a nasty hangover again I would stop for another 30 days...That hangover was yesterday. I'm proud of what I've achieved so far but I can't let myself slip back into old habits...So I Will Not Drink With You Today. :)
Happy Sunday SD....I will not drink with you all today!!
Sunday night here but enjoyed my 8th sober weekend. IWNDWYT &lt;3
