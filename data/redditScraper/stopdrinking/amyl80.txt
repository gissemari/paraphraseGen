Hey everyone. To preface I was sober for 10 months before relapsing. After being on a 5 month bender I got back on track which started 5 days ago. Today was pure garbage. I went to a Superbowl party hosted by my work and that was a big mistake. I stayed sober but dealing with all of the drunk people and not drinking seriously drained me. It got so bad that I had to take a walk around the neighborhood just to collect myself. I also feel like I forgot how to be myself. I'm in a weird spot. But I want to share something that I wrote during my first 10 months and it helps me keep calm and going forward. Maybe it will help you too....I'm afraid..Prone to panic it's manic can't stand it a lunatic in disguise I keep quite in the eyes of the unknown. Barriers set in stone unable to siege the inner workings of a man who had potential but who has never grown...Just skin and bones. A skeleton in the closet can't pause it cant turn back time to the day that I lost it but there's no profit in dwelling on fuck ups just stop it and focus on the immediate roadblocks ahead just toss it...Can't tell if the shakes are from withdrawls or all the coffee I've ingested I've been bested by a better life in reach if I can breach the past hold fast and steady the broken mast this ship can still sail no matter how choppy the waves I won't fail. ..No matter the barrier I'll carry 'er I will not break even if it's scarier to go this path alone. Atone for my mistakes and open the gates I must push through the rapid current and earn it...I will never fall fuck it all. Cock the hammer don't stammer let the anger resonate within and swing down again like I used to. Get loud get proud obliterate the persona before myself and get down and dirty turn the key and open the door to be free I will come back from the brink of insanity...Oh calamity coming from a place so pathetic don't let it define the person I am becoming it's stunning how much I've accomplished in such little time don't forget the night I drew the line and forged a better me. ..Created and crafted to be drafted to a better place in existence without the assistance of the bottle throttle the ravenous hunger malicious blunder be vindictive in my approach to silence the once overpowering thunder...Under the influence of a newfound tenacity but life laughs at me captures me and spastically throws nothing but cold stones and wishbones to set the tone of living without a crutch but I can feel the touch of something grander no delusions of grandeur I'll better myself and become commander of my own fate...It's not too late It's stiched in my skin and drilled into my head instead of waiting around in bed with spoon fed depression and a compression of anxiety don't lie to me I got up and took the path of sobriety to clear my mind and find what defines me unbind restrictions set friction to the locks on the blocks and me don't flee from this prison first understand the cause creation and corruption of self destruction then take the step to the junction where I'll invision a new mission...Fission be damned I've regrouped from my stuper and man can't say it's been easy but damn when something is worth a fuck you need to stand tall through it all. Force past the gargoyles spit back at the turmoil the wretches the incessant voice that catches and stretches your skin thin enough to burst blood from hell to above. What you need is love. Love yourself take your passion down from the shelf and reintroduce it to your world. Hurl your fears deep into the ocean poach em encroach your own mind and find out what you've been missing. It will take more than a stitching but I promise it's a life so much better.

Wow! You are a great writer...Also kudos to you for being willing to share something so personal...Here are few things I picked up from your story:.1) While you may be frustrated that you got overwhelmed at the party tonight you did a really reasonable and healthy thing by taking a few minutes to yourself to go for a walk and collect your thoughts. Good job!.2) I am definitely not the most creative person in the world but have been known to occasionally turn out some better than average writing art school project etc. I would often drink in order to focus and then incorrectly assume I needed to drink to set my mind free and be creative. You wrote what you shared during a sober period! Think about how much creativity passion and cohesion alcohol takes away. Without sobriety you may not have been able to do that...IWNDWYT! Thank you again for sharing. No one said this would be easy every day. That's why we come here to support each other.
