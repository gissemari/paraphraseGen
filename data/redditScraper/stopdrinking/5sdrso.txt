I wrote this and posted yesterday but it's still weighing on my mind so I decided to share here. ..This post is a reminder to myself. When I first decided I was truly going to get sober I frequented a subreddit on #reddit called r/stopdrinking. It saved my life. It was a group of people who knew what I was struggling with. Who were there with words of encouragement and direct messages of hope and cheering each day of sobriety on. I'm not on it as much as I used to be but sometimes I still check in just to see how the community is doing. This was the first post I saw this morning. ..A person just like me who has been sober for four years just like me decided to try again. I would be lying to you if I told you I hadn't thought about it. What's one drink out with friends? They can handle it like normal! I should be able to too! But I'm so fucking thankful that I know myself. It wouldn't be just one. It would start out that way. Then I would sneak to the liquor store after leaving wherever I was at and drink. And then the next morning; waking up and not remembering  anything from the night before. I have nightmares weekly that I've relapsed or that I'm trying to hide alcohol from those who care about me. ..I have lived with a little voice in the back of my head for as long as I can remember. Telling me I'm not good enough that I'm not going to amount to anything. And I will not let that voice take over my life again. I do not need alcohol in my life to have fun. I do not need alcohol in my life to ease the pain of whatever I'm dealing with at that exact moment in time. I have promised myself that I will never go down that road again. And I'm keeping that promise no matter what. ..Thanks for reading. Just some early morning thoughts I needed to get out. To my sober friends: stay strong. To those struggling: if you want to change you will. But you have to want it more than anything in the world. Don't let anyone make you feel bad for having a problem. If they do they're not meant for your life. And if this post makes you uncomfortable let's talk about it. .

Thank you for your AM post!.Love it  
Well put and thank you.
And to any of those among us who stumble and fall know that it does not undo all that you've achieved so far.  We learn each and every day.  Here's hoping that we all choose not to drink today.
Well said.  Taken to Heart!..I don't take my wonderful Sober Life for granted!..I don't have to be *Vigilant* like the early days which was tiring and time consuming.  I **do** practice my daily disciplines.  I **don't** listen to the little whispers.  I **do** go to a meeting or call a sober support person if some crazy idea gets into my head.  ..When I start each day with some mindfulness when I include some Kindness when I own my "stuff" and move from 'reaction' to people places and things toward 'responding' to life.......  when I do my inventory each evening.......  I'm *On Track* and Grateful!..I don't ever take it for Granted...Sober On!!  
Great post. I'm glad you came back and checked in with us again. 
Thank you for writing out what I was going through as I read grumpie's post as well!  I was tempting myself last night with boozy milkshakes but didn't do it.  Going on 2 years and it's amazing how that little voice still pipes up.  I don't even really want any freaking booze but that pattern is so instilled to associate drinking with relaxation and fun.  That is definitely not where I was at when I quit!  Here's to many more years of vigilance and sobriety.
