I have been sober for nearly two months and nearly sober (<weekly relapses) for about 6.  My wife is understandably terrified of another relapse.  ..I understand (now) that even a single drink can reset some of the repair to alcohol dependant networks to prime one for heavier relapse and as such bolstered my dedication to eliminate alcohol from my life entirely. ..My wife who is an incredibly intelligent woman became upset that I had eaten the 5 brandied cherries that came with my desert last night.     I told her she was being silly which was a mistake.  I don't like brandied cherries enough to eat them again if it upset her but could not relent that they did not constitute a relapse risk.  I told her that the 5 cherries likely had less than 0.5% of an ounce of alcohol between them which didn't help things one bit. She thought that any amount of alcohol was too big a risk.  I said I agreed in principle but in reality the body naturally produces over 25 times that amount of ethanol an hour as a by product of metabolism... I was promptly told to sleep on the couch and she still isn't talking to me.  ..Though her fears of a relapse are fully justified it is difficult for me to view this particular concern as anything other than an irrational over reaction.

I agree with your wife.  1000%.
I used to think (and argue) like you just did. But after coming back from a 10 year relapse I totally agree with your wife. Not sure about the part about sleeping on the couch though. Or maybe we are missing something ...
Much like the debate with non-alcoholic beer I think its got barely anything to do with the amount of alcohol in the chocolate and whether it will actually have any noticeable effect but rather to do with the very fact you are consuming alcohol. And consuming alcohol that tastes like alcohol too. Personally I avoid them just as much as I avoid alcoholic drinks.

My paranoia is such that I won't even use hand sanitizer with alcohol in it nor will I use the solvent grade ethanol in my laboratory if I have another option.  Maybe I'm going overboard but I don't see the harm.
I think we all need to draw our own lines and question our own behavior when it comes to this kind of thing...My line would be to put foods which are prepared with alcohol as part of their very gestalt on the same side of the line where I put beer wine and whiskey.  This is regardless of the amount of alcohol they may contain and would definitely include these *brandied* cherries.  On the other hand foods that incidentally have alcohol and in small amount like soy sauce I put on the "safe" side of my line...But more importantly I think what is needed is self examination.  Ask yourself **why** do you ingest something prepared with alcohol and with a type of alcohol in its very name?  What does ingesting it represent to you?  What benefit are you getting from it?  What are you thinking about when you see it and ingest it?  What are your plans with regards to it going forward?..
As a part of making amends I did everything possible to allay any fears of the people who loved me. Because my drinking caused them worry and suffering for years it was the least I could do to not cause any more grief. Not eating brandied cherries would fall into that category. Your wife deserves your respect. Honor her wishes without argument. The couch is an appropriate place for you.
Why risk it? If it's not a risk you lose nothing. If it is a risk then you're in course for a relapse. ..Therefore the only logical step is to not risk it. ..I personally advise my sponsees to avoid anything with alcohol in not necessarily for the physical effort but for the psychological one. Like 'Fred' in AAs big book who thought no harm could come from just having a nip of whiskey in his next glass of milk we must learn not to trust our justifying ego. 
You owe your wife an apology. While you're busy discussing the rational (not much alcohol etc.) You are ignoring the emotional (why are you playing with a lit stick of dynamite). She's telling you how she feels and you're telling her why she should not feel that way. Instead of telling her that you understand how she feels and why. (Almost aside from the point that she has a damn good reason to feel that way.)..I get it that you don't think of this as drinking behavior. Though I would disagree; if you're relapsing every couple of weeks and brandied fruit even comes up as a question I think it's drinking behavior. Still maybe this is not a drunken rationalization as much as a male one--reason instead of emotional connection...Source: I am male and do this **all** the time except when I don't.  
Acknowledge that is about BOTH of you not just you and not just her. You are going through this together in different ways with difference experiences. There is give and take on both sides and one of your "gives" should be to not argue with someone who has seen you in that state don't explain things away if that was something you did before because she'll most likely not listen to or believe a word you're saying. 
Yah they kind of are. You have some solid advice in the below posts. Good luck kiddo.
