Mother in law came over last night to watch the kids and saved the weekend by taking it with her.  Wtf is wrong with people step mother in law knows I'm trying to quit and I'm struggling.  That's some passive aggressive shit right there or maybe I'm reading too much into it.  Just wanted to vent.  IWNDWYT!

Most people have no clue what it's like to be an alcoholic. They don't realize that if they leave behind booze it will turn into you drinking it all than going to the store to buy more and before you know it you've blown your paycheck doing stupid things all night long 
Its frustrating but try not to sweat it.  Pour it out it'll be like a sweet revenge.  I guess that would be passive agressive resonse to passive aggressive behaviour?  ;-)
Since she  knows you have quit I put it into the P.A.S. as well as unkind and impolite.There is nothing wrong about venting about it either.IWNDWYT.
My drink of choice was beer.  My spouse hasn't quit drinking but it hasn't really bothered me since he drinks wine so I'm not that tempted.  Last night he asked me to pick up a case of my favorite beer for him.  I watched him drink it.  I even smelled it.  I was SO TEMPTED to have 6 and buy a pack of smokes (I quit drinking and smoking on the same day since they are tied together for me.)  But I resisted and didn't give in.  ...I think they probably don't understand what it's like for you - especially since your FIL can just drink one and not the whole six pack like I would!  There's a saying:  Don't ascribe to malice could just as easily be attributed to ignorance.  Don't make a big deal of it but DO ask them to take any alcohol they bring with them back to their house.  Good on you for not giving in!  IWNDWYT.
