Everything is going well. I want to thank and express my appreciation to all the folks that offered me encouragement and kind words when I was really down. There's nothing worse than the guilt shame remorse regret etc that exist with a relapse. So Thanks friends! Y'all are the best!

Glad you're back! I'm grateful for my relapse because of the consequences. It could have been much worse but I ended up calling in sick to work the next day. I knew before but now it's really fresh that no matter where I am or who I am with I will abuse alcohol and experience repercussions. Hopefully you got something out of it too! Congratulations in getting right back on the horse--it can be hard to admit you fell but honesty really does help.
hey man good on ya. just remember you are in control and evidently you're doing pretty good. idk what kind of support system you have but thats huge!  even just a friend you can vent to is all you need.
