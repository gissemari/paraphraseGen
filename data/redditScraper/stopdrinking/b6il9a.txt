I've struggled with drinking for a long time now and I'm tired of being tied to the bottle. Today I am going to be sober. Tomorrow I am going to be sober. I know I can do it... ive done it while pregnant. I don't think I've ever fully WANTED to do it but now I do. I can't risk losing everything over essentially nothing. ..I've looked up A.A. meeting near me I'm going to go on Saturday morning. Swallow my pride. I think I may enjoy it- having people around me that understand. ..I'm ready to be better and be the woman mother wife daughter that I know I can be.
