...that won't seem to go away lately. I'm going to a meeting later today to talk about it. My old record of sustained sobriety was 82 days. I'm in bold new territory here. The past week or two I've had really strong urges/thoughts to drink. Go get say just a pint and drink it slow. Continue the meetings and everything else don't let anyone know you drank. It will just be that one pint...Luckily I've been able to play the tape forward. I know I'd feel like complete shit the morning after the slip. The guilt and the shame. It would not end there either oh no. I'd keep drinking until acted upon by an outside force. Probably another trip to the hospital. I'm grateful for the clarity I have now and I don't have to act on these pervasive thoughts. I can talk about it. Thanks for listening to me vent I will not drink today!

Relapse thoughts have no power over me any day I remembered to commit not to drink TODAY.  Adding an AA meeting is doubly powerful.  Good luck you may find yourself turning a corner today or tomorrow since this post and your commitment to a recovery meeting reflect honest self insight.
Congrats on 105 days sober twin. I had a craving on Saturday I was lonely and tired; I didn't realize it right away but when I did the craving already passed. Later I played the tape forward and thought darn - if I would have given in I would have ruined my first sober Memorial Day weekend (and would have landed in the ER once again)! I made it and I'm glad you're making it too :)
