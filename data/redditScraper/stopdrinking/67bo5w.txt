Hey everyone. I'm trying to stop drinking. There is a problem with that: It's the only "medication" I've tried that "treats" my bipolar disorder. Whenever I'm in an elevated mood state I get irritable and I hurt people close to me. So I drink and it stops the mood swing. I'm a better person when I'm drunk...It's why I relapsed yesterday. Maybe this isn't the best place to post this. Still I'm not going to drink with you today. Good luck everyone...

Have you tried a wide variety of medicines to treat your condition? 
Yep...I have been medicated on and off most of my life. Here's the thing I have noticed meds do NOT work when you are constantly wasted. ..Withdraw will be a bitch. My mood swings were probably the most crazy intense shit I have dealt with in a long time. But after my body got used to the meds sans alcohol and I got them stabilized I started feeling so much better. Find a doctor you like and will listen to you.
