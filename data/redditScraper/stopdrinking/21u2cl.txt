As you might imagine having spent 5 months in federal prison 6 months on an ankle bracelet and 2 years "on paper" for my alcoholic failure to file or pay taxes in the midst of a 7 year relapse--doing my taxes is still an annual moment of extreme stress for me.  This year was complicated by payroll at my office going online and accessible by password username--all of which I could never find.  I just completed my much more simplified tax returns and apart from owing the city I reside in $.03--I'm done!   R-E-L-I-E-F

Wow - so do you write a check for that? :)..I'm very glad you're done with it. Now my turn... 
Alleluia!
Aw shit - thanks for reminding me it's April.
Yea.   I missed some years but they owed me so no consequences. 
Nice one. 
Hooray!!
