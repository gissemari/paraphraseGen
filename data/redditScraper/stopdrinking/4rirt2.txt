I just woke up from a dream where I was chugging Bacardi rum and chasing it back with Guinness. The worst part about this dream was that the alcohol seemed so appealing. Well it was just a dream. No reason to get drunk over it. I'm gonna go clean out my car now.

I've had these dreams before as well. The meaning I created around them was that even my subconscious was alcoholic. I have no reservations about what happens when I drink. So I never drink. 
I've had so many of these. I wake up and I'm like "I'm still sober right?!?" In a moment of panic. ..I need to clean out my car too.
It really sucks because of how vivid they can be. It may cause you a bit of anxiety when you wake up but remind yourself that it's only a dream. ..My relapse dreams usually occur when i'm slipping on my program but i understand that not everyone in here is in AA. If you are i recommend talking to your sponsor about it. If you're not maybe find a way today to be of service to someone else. That is usually what helps me. 
I had these so often when I was sober my first time. Usually they subside by the end of the first month. Check out the sidebar for more info on drinking dreams.
