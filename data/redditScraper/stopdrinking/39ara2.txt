My best guess is this may have been my fist alcohol free year in over 30 years.  A year ago I woke up hungover and decided I had enough.  Little did I know then it was the best decision of my life.  My life has improved in uncountable ways new job new city better health better relationships and a much better outlook on life.  I want to thank everyone in this sub.  I check in daily.  You keep me motivated..For anyone struggling in early day's of sobriety stick with it. It will get better!

Congrats! Said nearly the same thing to my son this morning - first time in probably 25 years that I've ever been able to say that I haven't had a drink in a year!  Not everything is roses and rainbows today but I'm in a much better place personally. I raise a seltzer toast in your general direction - Slainte!
