...My last drink was October 24th 2016. I almost forgot this account existed but man what a trip it is reading my old posts. I was an absolute fucking mess close to death in my early 20's. I was sure back then i was going to die soon and even worse I felt like i deserved it. I could talk all day about how absolutely terrible it was but I'm sure all of you know the feeling it's your own personal hell. Nowadays I rent a house with my girlfriend got a great job and my health has for the most part come back. Things aren't perfect but that's fine that's life. ..I honestly think a huge part in my getting sober was the Antabuse it's not for everyone but if you're struggling talk to a doctor about it. Thanks to everyone on this subreddit so much. Life is beautiful when you stop clouding your mind.
