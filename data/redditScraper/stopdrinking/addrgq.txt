Sorry if I haven't been popping in to SD as much as I used to. Life can get busy and complicated when you aren't ignoring it in favor of getting hammered.  ..Well here we are. Every 100 days I ask myself the same question. "How about it? Go back to drinking?"  ..Still even now the idea of quitting forever and ever is not easily entertained. So I commit to staying sober for 100 days. Forever is in 100-day chunks for me and every time that badge by my name trips over to an even hundred I revisit the question. And I post here. [This](https://old.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/8tf8xs/is_today_a_good_day_to_start_drinking_again/) is my 1900 Day post and there's links in it to earlier posts if you want to go through them.  ..So is today a good day to go back out?  ..I don't think so. One of the things I have been doing is asking myself before I take any action "To what purpose?" I want to go shopping....to what purpose? To pass some time or to get that thrill of a new purchase? I want to say something unflattering about a colleague. To what purpose? To feel taller by making them shorter?  ..So when I consider taking a drink I ask myself "To what purpose?" I know the answer it's "To get drunk." But *why*?  ..Am I feeling lonely or irritated or angry or tired? Am I bored? Why? Why am I feeling drawn toward taking a drink? And what other options do I have to deal with whatever has me unsettled?  ..Another reason I have for passing on the booze is something I have learned lately in a course called "[The Addicted Brain](https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain)" that I have been studying. The damage done to the brain over a period of addiction to drugs and alcohol can take a long long time to heal. Do I really want to re-injure my brain for the sake of a few hours of intoxication? To what purpose?  ..By the way this course is offered by Emory University a leading medical research university and can be audited at no cost. If you are interested in the neurochemistry of drugs and alcohol and exactly what happens in the brain then I recommend it highly.  ..So the answer once again is "No." Today isn't a good day for that shit. And once again I commit to staying sober for another 100 days. When you get down to it it's just a bunch of Day Ones in a row really.  ..For you fellow SDers who have some time in I am proud to walk with you. To you new people just stay sober until bedtime and have some faith in yourself. There's lots of us that went through the same struggles you're experiencing and if we can do it so can you. You aren't alone.  ..For now I am going to have to bring this post to an end. My course lesson and quiz is due tonight and I have been dragging my ass until the last minute....as usual.  ..I might be sober but I am far from perfect. See you in 100 days if not sooner.

I'm on day 5. ..Thank you so much for this.
Wow thank you for this! I love the 100 day idea because I too just can't fathom myself saying I'm done forever. Forever is a long time and it seems unachievable. But 100 days? Then revisit? I think I can do that.

I love this. I get stressed by the idea of "forever" too. So once I have 90 days then 90 more days then a year I'm going to start thinking of it in 100-day chunks maybe. Thank you. 
Wow. Excellent method for you old timers. .I love the idea of the course. So you can follow it for free? .But if you want the official certificate you have to pay? Is that it?.I'm very tempted.  Just to start the thing off and see where it leads.  I'm not versed in science but have a good general knowledge. Do you think I could attempt it?
I like the "every hundred days" idea. Great post. :)
Wow i like the "to what purpose" question. It can be used for anything you're about to do. And happy cake day!
