I started with wanting to hit 30 have kept it rolling. ..I'm still having ups and downs but overall things are trending upward. Still no weight loss still lots of sugar binges and still having mood swings. But I'm less depressed overall sleeping better and thinking about alcohol less...This is uncharted territory for me never been this sober (no substances) for this long in my adult life. ..This community has been huge. You all are awesome and I appreciate all the perspectives--hearing the long timers people just starting and the recent relapses--it all helps. IWNDWYT!

Every day's a victory. You're doing awesome.
Congrats! You'll be at 90 in no time! Your mental health needs time recover. Be patient...you will feel better and better I promise.
This is great. I feel like I could write something similar. I am close to 60 as well! I am getting excited for 100 days alcohol free! 
Glad to hear this as I approach 30.  The PAWS were bad this weekend.  Worst cravings yet.  I held it together.  Thanks SD for the support!
