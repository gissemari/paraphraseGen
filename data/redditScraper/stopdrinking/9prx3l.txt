I've spent this week thinking about my worst points over the last year particularly when I relapsed or when I felt like I might. Somewhere I saw HALT (Hungry Angry Lonely Tired) and nearly every memory includes one of those themes preceding when I would drink into a hole. Anxiety pops up too but it was when I was hungry or alone that I used to drink most. Those triggers still pop up for me but since I stopped drinking the anxiety switch is collecting dust. I do feel a lot better than I did...Now I'm working on Anger which is mostly 1) I made this into a problem when it used to be a hobby and 2) my frustration at being unable to enjoy something I still like to taste. There's always something new I guess. Of course my frustration and self-anger make me want a drink! But that only gets worse if I pick up the rope and try to fight or obsess about it. Gotta let it pass and carry on with the good things like proper food good company and enough deep sleep. Drinking wasn't a problem until I made it a problem. Now stressing about it does not need to be a problem and that's where I'm at today.  For all the people putting in the early days things do get easier if you stick with it a day at a time!
