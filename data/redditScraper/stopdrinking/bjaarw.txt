I'm an early-50-something who never really drank until college and then just weekends for another dozen years after that.  Top grades in competitive private schools then a demanding job but one that I loved where I eventually became amongst the best in my field.  Came from a long family line of heavy drinkers so always had in the back of my mind that I didn't want to fall into that trap.  That said I started to ramp up in my early/mid-30s when my wife and I had kids.  I'm somewhere on the autistic spectrum and am a neat-freak perfectionist who likes things just so and whilst I'd never say that the constant din clutter and noise associated with children drove me to drink now that the kids are both away in college I have to admit that that was clearly a factor.  Note that my wife has always (and continues) to drinks about five bottles of wine *a year* max so I was definitely drinking for two.  How much?  I never developed a taste for hard liquor found I was allergic to red wine over time then found I was just pretending to like white wine which just left beer.  And man did I love beer.  Four .33 liter bottles a day every day (that's two shots of pure alcohol methinks) with perhaps as much as double that on some weekends.  The place I live prices beer as a foodstuff so it's dirt cheap so there was never a financial impact.  Only drank at home or events where my wife drove home or I could take public transport.  That said whilst I was pretty scrupulous about not drink driving nor operating power equipment and was never pulled over nor got in any trouble with the law I definitely sailed pretty close to the wind driving with too much BAC the next day...Why was I drinking so much?  1) I think a lot of high-performing people drink for the challenge of being able to "pull off" a hard-drinking lifestyle.  Type A personalities tend to be contrarian and not like to be told what to do.  It became a bit of a subconscious challenge; I didn't miss any work (although there were a few times I knew I was too hung over to get away with it and worked from home) and I sometimes liked the little rush that I'd get when I'd be a bit hung over and still manage to stay stuck in and concentrated at work and still get a lot accomplished.  2) I am an expat in a foreign country and whilst I'm fluent in the language it became a great way for me to tune out a culture I found never really accepts foreigners. 3) Related to that I had the perfect excuse of being borderline unpresentable to avoid having to go to local weekend social events; my wife (a local) and fully-bilingual kids would go and I'd genuinely staying home enjoying the peace and quiet and lack of hassle of speaking my second language.  4) I already mentioned it was a great way to tune out the constant din of home life with two children.  5) I think there's a social class aspect; working class people are "drunks" whilst upper class professionals can "hold their liquor".  Ha ha.  In some social circles not drinking indicates that you're some sort of uninteresting religious nut or health freak.  This loops back to #1 above and I have a theory that this is why the British drink so much...Why did I decide I wanted to stop?  1) In your mid-50s you start noticing the world splits into those who drink heavily and those who don't and it becomes easier to tell which camp one's in by physical appearance.  I also started noticing that a lot of people my age who "took early retirement" or "changed careers" were more likely than not drunks eased out as they started to look less professional. I love my job too much to potentially have that happen.   2) About three years ago I had a serious gout attack in my big toe.  It was the most painful experience of my entire life.  When told beer was a cause of higher uric acid in one's bloodstream I didn't stop drinking completely but every time I'd feel a tingle I'd cut back a lot for fear of triggering it again.  I haven't had another since but I thought to myself "well knowing that couldnhappen again certainly takes the fun out of drinking".  3) At 50 I had a full physical including colonoscopy EKG blood work etc. and everything came back normal (ex-the aforementioned uric acid at the borderline for chronic gout).  I have had mild high blood pressure my whole life I've had to monitor but they put me on light medication which I didn't like to have to do ... another incentive to quit alcohol to perhaps be able to wean myself off them. 4) After a 50-year drinking career my mother quit cold turkey with no fanfare nor fuss and I figured I could too.  My father is 80 still drinks a lot and now has mobility issues exacerbated by being overweight ... had he quit I'm convinced he would've been better off and I felt I might have been on the same long slow slide.  5) I became interested in celebrities such as Alice Cooper and others who are high-profile tee-totalers who seem to still lead interesting lives.  I read three quotes that stuck with me:  "Bitterness is drinking poison and hoping the other person will die" "I got tired of having five-dollar reactions to nickle provocations" and "you never meet anyone over 70 with a beer gut".  6) My kids have to make their own life choices but I felt that if they came home to a less boozy household on breaks they'd be less inclined to start drinking heavily themselves.   7) I live on a little farm with a lot of outdoor work to do and I found I was starting to procrastinate on projects with the excuse that I'd started drinking for the day and didn't want to push it ... mind you I'd always cracked a first beer on weekend days around lunchtime and sipped my way through the afternoon still accomplishing lots of stuff whilst sozzled but over time I found I'd rather jut sit around drinking and surfing the web.  8) I've gotten more into hunting again in a place where it's highly-regulated with zero tolerance for any BAC and found myself wishing I could go out at dusk but couldn't because I was a few beers in the bag.  I also restored a classic car that doesn't have seatbelts nor any modern safety equipment and felt I needed to be extra-alert whilst driving it.  9) My own vanity:  I noticed I was having some spider veins lasered off was developing rosacea my gums were receding and my coated tongue was giving me bad breath about which I was becoming increasingly self-conscious.  Plus I was no longer able to hold my college weight as I had before and was too cheap to buy new fat man's clothes ... I'm no runway model but I started seeing myself in photographs and thinking "is that the way I *look*"?..So on this past New Year's eve I finished my last beer but the bottle neatly back in the returnables and haven't opened one since.  I was braced for all sorts of seizures cravings relapses crying jags DTs etc. but much to my amazement none of those things happened.  I kept thinking back to how I'd finally figured out I was allergic to red wine and just stopped drinking it so I created the same mental compartmentalization for beer ... something I used to enjoy but simply couldn't anymore.  And that was it...Pros:  I've lost a bunch of weight my head appears to have deflated I think I'm marginally less grey. I don't have to worry about keeping my distance at work. I notice my equilibrium has improved I don't end up with mystery overexertion injuries I didn't feel as they were happening whilst working outside. I sleep better and actually remember dreams for the first time in decades. I perspire less. I can drive and shoot whenever I want.  I take the dogs on longer walks through the fields. I think my wife and kids like me marginally better.  I *think* I'm getting long better with people at work.  I definitely feel physically better...Cons:  I find it harder to concentrate on boring repetitive tasks such as hacking my home finances into my PC software a job that was just *made* to go with heavy drinking.  I have a strong craving for sweets and salty snacks two things I avoided my whole life.  Drinking like a fish on transcontinental flights and in airport lounges was fun and I find being sober makes jet lag much worse.  You realize that some of the hard-drinking acquaintances you used to out up with are now insufferable so you lose some "friends" along the way.  My mother and I agree that the amazing transformation one expects doesn't really materialize ... the world's still the same crappy place with stupid people but you're in a better frame of mind to let stuff roll off your back...In closing I'm still a grumpy old git but I find I have more patience.  I actually find Reddit pretty annoying in general so this is the only thing there I visit.  Even this place can be a bit repetitive and I don't agree with everything I read (I'm an atheist and whilst I acknowledge AA may work for some I don't like anything involving God-botherers and find their perpetual addict approach condescending the "IWNDWYT" thing is a bit odd I tried LaCroix on a trip to the States and was surprised how crap it was "you got this" is gramattically incorrect etc.)  However if there's one place a "hive mind" appears to be appropriate it's a support group so I let things slide in a way I never would've before...Thanks to the folks here for helping me through; I found myself in "moments of micro-boredom" skimming through the posts and feeling I wasn't doing this on my own.  Everyone is on his own journey but I hope I can give a bit back by providing some encouragement.  I've started subtely "outing" myself with friends and acquaintances and what amazes me is how many people appear encouraging and even inspired rather than judgemental or critical ... sometimes I sense people are *relieved* to not *have* to drink with you today.
