Been struggling with booze since last summer and as of the past few months it's been really bad. Finally putting in the effort to slow down or stop all together and I'm on day three. I quit cigarettes in the past and after the third day the cravings started to subside. I'm wondering how long alcohol cravings last. And I mean like crazy strong cravings like I've had the last couple days much like what you get with cigs. I've read that it can takes weeks months years even. Anyone have any input on how long it took them until the cravings were short and not very powerful?

I don't know but I am having one helluva craving right now.  Man!  Feels like if I could just have a glass of wine the world would right itself again.  ..I know that's addiction talking. And I know I am worth fighting for. So for now.....IWNDWYT..Would love to see some responses to your question from those that have BTDT. ..
Alcohol leaves the body after about ten days. After that things got easier for me. But I still get some ferocious cravings. I have about six months sober. I expect I'll get them forever.
