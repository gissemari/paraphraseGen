Just finished up a nice workout. The weather is perfect here (Chicago). Walking past a lot of bars and restaurants that are packed with winers and diners but I actually don't feel left out tonight. Going to eat a glorious chopped salad and tuck in early. For today I've made positive decisions the most important being not to drink. Tomorrow is another day but tonight I'm sober and grateful. ..I hope everyone is enjoying a peaceful night and to anyone struggling  I wish you well and I promise not to drink with you tonight.

Needed this encouraging reminder tonight! Thanks for sharing.
Sounds like a great evening!
A long day 3 for me..glad u made it:)glad I made it:).good night
Hellz yes!! Good stuff. 
Having a party on a Mtn Bike early tomorrow morning with friends.  Drinking the day before does not jive with keeping up with that group.  Little plans like that keep me from drinking TODAY. 
Cutting out alcohol gave me amazing gains in the last weeks..Good job!
Changing habits and routines has been my number 1 assist in kicking the booze.  Sounds like you are doing just that.
