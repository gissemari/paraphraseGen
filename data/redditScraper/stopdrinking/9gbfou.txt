I have been subscribed to this sub on and off never being able to fully commit. I am ready because I can't do it anymore. This is a long read but it will be therapeutic for me to write it all down. Here's my story: .I was the quiet one all throughout school but I did well and participated in sports. Teachers neither loved or hated me but I was never the one who they were glad to avoid just a  nice child' on the periphery. As soon as I reached the working age I went out and got a job as a lifeguard. This job offered me a lot more exposure to things I'd never even thought about. It was also my first time having beer and hard liquor and more so my first taste of  partying.  My summers for the next 8 years become one big lifeguard themed party. Working 11-7 were the perfect hours to drink at night any still be able to wake up for work. No hangovers. I was a kid. .Under the influence of alcohol for the first time I felt included and I felt like I was comfortable with myself. People talked to me more. Apparently I was a fun drinker and my personality did a complete 180 degree turn when I was a few drinks in. You wanted someone to talk to you about your interests and ask an insightful question. That was me when drinking yet sober me didn't show much of an interest in anything. Then my college years came and by then I was a  seasoned teen drinker .  I thought college would be like the movies and I'd find another great group of friends and we'd party our way to a degree. Life doesn't always work out and college hit me like a bag of bricks. I had multiple issues related to school and my mental health. I struggled and had to transfer to a community college back home. But I still had my summers. I continued to drink heavily but now I was in the comfort of my home town and my old friends so it always escalated. .I got a job that didn't require a lot of thought or training. I lived for the weekends. I would binge drink Friday through Sunday and then come into work Monday exhausted and hungover. This has gone on for years all the way to present day. But I am so sick of waking up full of regret worry and shame just hoping I didn't do anything pathetic the night before. My few friends that I have pressure me to drink and I am to scared to say no because I don't want to lose them. .Now I am engaged to a wonderful woman and I am so lucky to have met her. Unfortunately every weekend I still use it as an excuse to get as drunk as I can stand. All of my problems can be traced back to my drinking. I am so done with it. I want to wake up early with the birds and sit with a cup of coffee without having to chug it because I am late for work. I want to go to bed on my own not wake up on the couch at 4 AM wondering what the he'll happened. I don't want to think that drinking by myself is fun. I don't want to see how quickly I can get drunk. I want to remember and I want to live a sober life. I am ready for the journey. .I will not drink with you today. ...Thank you for allowing me to tell my story.

I relate to this so much. I'm a natural introvert and I felt like I became a much more dynamic and likable person when drinking...I honestly don't know if I would've made any friends in college without alcohol making me  fun  and chatty. Unfortunately by my mid twenties I'd also lost a lot of friendships due to alcohol and most of my self-worth too. I'm newly sober and part of me is worried that I won't be fun anymore and my friends won't like me but a larger part is ready to finally accept myself for who I am no matter what happens. Thanks for sharing your story and best of luck! IWNDWYT. :)
