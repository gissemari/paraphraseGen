My girlfriend of three years has decided to quit drinking. She got an intoxication ticket a couple weeks ago and decided that enough is enough. Being that I live with her I decided to stop also to support her decision. It's been a week with no struggles but I do have a question. ..Both of us are in a dart league which is at a bar weekly. She has decided that it would be best if she didn't participate anymore to prove to herself and others that she's committed. Now I'm not sure what to do. Should I go and not drink? Should I quit also? I know my team is counting on me. She has told me to go and wants me to go. I would quit for her in a heartbeat and I've expressed that to her. Any suggestions?

Her not going sounds like a great idea (wise woman!) You going or not going sounds totally up to you.
&gt;She has decided that it would be best if she didn't participate anymore to prove to herself and others that she's committed...I like your girlfriend...she sounds like a mature serious proactive person.  Please tell her I wish her luck (and no I am not hitting on her...I am sure I am at least twice her age :) )
You guys sound like an awesome couple! Good luck with everything.
