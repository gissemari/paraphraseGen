----------immediate responses--------

**TRIUMPH** ..Went to our favorite wine bar last night and it wasn't awkward! I asked the bartender for a soda water and he simply shrugged nodded and got me my soda water. I wish all reactions could be so nuetral. Not drinking wouldn't be so bad if not for the constant prying and pressure.   ...**STRUGGLE**...Boyfriend said he misses drinking wine with me. *sigh*. I miss it too of course. I explained that while I could totally have a glass of wine and not go home and secretly chug the gin in the cabinet (barf) I'd use that successful night as rationalization for the next time. And the next time. And eventually I'd binge compulsively and destructively like I did on that sunday night a few weeks ago. and I'm so tired of it hanging over me all the time. He understands. I asked if I was less fun (dad says I'm less fun sober. Cool. :() and he said of course not. So there's that.   ...**NONSENSE** ..Guys. I finished my sock the other day. [YIPPIE KIYAY MOTHER FUCKER](http://imgur.com/e69cjJQ) I've started the second and hope to have a pair in a week.   ...Favorite band right now is Elle King and Gin wigmore. Lots of independent strong woman type songs. :)
*Triumph:* 4 months sober now and the cravings are very few and far between. I'm reaping the benefits of a sober life and loving it!..*Struggle:* Plantar Fasciitis is making walking painful and running is right out. I'm trying to exercise more but this foot pain is making it difficult to do the things I enjoy doing for exercise. ..*General Nonsense:* I love Send Me On My Way too - it's on my walking playlist! I listen to a variety of music: dance pop hip-hop when I'm exercising; folk and "singer/songwriter-indie" when I'm relaxing or cooking. Nick Drake is a favorite.
Happy Hump Day!..**Triumph:**Taking names and kicking goals at work - even better I'm gaining a sense of fulfillment and a job well done. Have some new challenges  a pay rise and general super cool stuff! I have lost 20kgs since Christmas and seriously look awesome! I have started seeing a personal trainer and I think I may actually have some consistency!..**Struggle**: I struggled to find my thing! Drinking was my thing and it has taken some time to understand. I really think I used drinking as my excuse to just check out - to do nothing. I've started oil painting I am currently shit at it I love it!..**Nonsense**: Two boxer dogs three cats a turtle and six baby chickens.....need I say more!..Heard Kings Of Leon on the radio this morning - remembered I like them. ..Hope all is well SD
Triumph: Nice going places without having to have the acquisition of alcohol be my top priority...Struggle: Weight...General Nonsense: If you are in your 40s and went to video game arcades buy "Ready Player One".  Nostalgia City Baby!..I really like:..Hamilton Musical and DMB right now.
Triumph: Started a boot camp and while I'm not going as religiously as I should.. its nice to get my body moving again. Also this is the first time I've exercised as a non-smoker (I quit smoking the same day as drinking) and can totally tell the difference...Struggle: EVERYTHING haha. I've been really cranky yesterday and this morning. Mad at my husband mad at booze mad at AA mad at my leggings etc...General Nonsense: As I want to get to know you what is your favourite music / band / song these days? Be Healthy by Dead Prez has been my morning motivation before I go into work the past few days.
Horrible nightmares last night.  Woke up this morning sore and sad.  I will not drink today though.  ..T- on day 3..S- still coping with possible alienation of entire fam..GN - Haven't listened to much lately.  Maybe Run the Jewels.
16 days...most consecutive days in about 5 years. ..Feeling great! Hope everyone is well today.
**Triumph:** Last weekend I attended the wedding of my best friend from High School.  I was shocked and saddened that my friend wasn't as understanding about my sobriety as I thought she was (this was someone who initially made me realize I had a problem and needed to change).  After being continually pressured to drink the entire night something finally clicked inside me.  I realized that ultimately it didn't matter that this friend doesn't get it.  I'm so proud of the sober person I've become.  Nothing is going to convince me to drink again...**Struggle:** I'm starting to slip into procrastination mode again putting off tasks and situations that are anxiety inducing.  Not sure how to snap out of it...**Nonsense:**  Seeds  by TV on the Radio has been on heavy rotation lately..
Triumph: down 2 sizes and got a whole new wardrobe (it's nice to have $ in my wallet instead of on a bar)..Struggle: Ran out of space at the office so I'll be working from home for a couple of weeks..I get to be my Mom's sole caretaker and it's not easy; she's an amputee on oxygen with severe dementia. It's physically and mentally draining. But hey she's my Mom and she took care of me :).General Nonsense: Politics at work. The writing is on the wall that the company is being set up for an acquisition so the drama is at a ridiculously high level. .I've gotten back into Vivaldi particularly because it both relaxes and motivates me at the same time. Great stress reliever during commuting :)
*Triumph* - not drinking after getting home from work late last night...*Struggle* - Lice. I'm having a service come to the house today because I'm concerned I can't get all the nits from my daughter's long and thick hair - after washing and combing etc - and the service costs a small fortune)..*Music* - The new Radiohead album that came out this past Sunday. It's absolutely amazing and I can't stop listening to it.
Triumph:  I went one day without drinking..Failure: I drank the second day. A failure is a failure but I feel slightly less guilty about it since I "only" had three drinks spaced out and went to sleep sober. Still feel bad though..Music:  General pop music eighties classic rock. 
**Triumph:** One week!  .**Struggle:** Felt my first pang for a drink from one of my habitual places. Felt it. Owned it. Moved past it. There will be more.  .**Nonsense:** Catching up on Frank Zappa as of late...I don't know why I've never listened to him before!
Triumph: Decided to stop drinking yesterday.  Told my husband and therapist. Got thru day 1 in one piece..Struggle: Now it is day 2!..I used to live in upstate NY and saw Rusted Root in various venues - love that song!..Have a great day everyone!

Triumph: Not a lot triumph this week. I have been getting up on my own without the aid of my wife the last few weeks. ..Struggle: I have been struggling with my ego. When I feel good the old cocky me comes back and I don't like it. I get that icky feeling. Need to work on some humility...General Nonsense: favorite musician is Tom Waits. But I have been listening to Brian Fallon (lead singer of The Gaslight Anthem) more recently. ..Happy Wednesday!
**Triumph**: An acquaintance found out through a friend that I've got some sobriety under my belt so she reached out for help for her own struggle with alcohol. I brought her out my AA home group last night and she had an amazing time despite being incredibly anxious about it going in. She thanked me profusely afterwards and seemed genuinely excited to continue coming out. She even picked up her own Big Book :)..**Struggle**: Seeing a very good friend of mine continue to drink though him and I share the same destructive characteristics of how we consume alcohol. He's just not ready to admit defeat yet but I'll be standing by with a helping hand when he is...**General Nonsense**: Current ear worm is [Robyn](https://soundcloud.com/lawrencetaylormusic/robyn-2) by Lawrence Taylor. So so good!..Also  I'm reading Dr. Michael Greger's book [How Not To Die](http://nutritionfacts.org/book/) concerning plant based diets and am LOVING IT.
DAY 3 BABAAAAAAAY!..**TRIUMPH**..Waking up hungover everyday before work made me boring as hell in the morning. Theres a girl at the bus stop every day who I always want to chat up but no conversation topics ever come into my head. Today was the first time in 6 months of seeing this girl that I had the mental clarity to show the true side of me make her laugh and get a date for tonight. Holy hell I never understood the affect alcohol had on me before...**STRUGGLE**..My roommates still don't know that I'm not drinking anymore (to avoid them pressuring me into drinking) and last night they drank HEAVY. All I had to tell them was "Eh I don't wanna drink today." And they were chill I guess they figured I'd drink this weekend but I'll give them that news when the time comes around...**GENERAL NONSENSE**..I'm launching my own business in about 2 weeks! ..Want a smile on your face? Can't go wrong with "There She Goes" by The La's...Oh yeah and I won't drink today.
**Triumph:** First day working from home. USually I'd use these days to drink cranberry-vodkas all day but nope! Having fruity iced teas all day. Also my first day of IOP treatment is today. ..**Struggle:** It is hard though.  Also I will probably be mentally/emotionally spent after IOP and want to drink. Also I need hobbies. I need to rediscover my interests and passion for something in life to pursue. I need to find that aspect of myself. Right now I got nothing. I was just all about alcohol...**General Nonsense:** I like everything with a strong complex punchy bassline like Rush and Primus. Also a fan of John Denver James Taylor and folksy artists.
**Triumph:** I never got a "pink cloud" early on. I don't know if I'm on the cloud now if it's my new normal or I'm seeing the fruits of my labors but life is fucking awesome right now. Even when it sucks...**Music:** [The National's Morning Dew](https://youtu.be/KLVLCXgTx3o) was on the radio when I turned it on yesterday. [Pink Floyd's "See Emily Play](https://youtu.be/5R8EpAv4miA) was on this morning. Great ways to start the day.
Triumph: People that I thought would never let me back in to their lives are talking to me again. Friends that I thought I lost years ago even are willing to talk with me again or go get something to eat. Hell they are even supportive of me being sober even after the shit I've put them through. ..Struggle: Infrequent liver pain (at least what I think is liver pain) is a bitch but I literally just paid off my ER bill a couple days ago and don't want to get in to more debt. Probably going to bite the bullet and go to urgent care soon to at least get a rough idea of what is going on...Nonsense: Been getting back in to hip-hop recently pretty heavily. Favorite hip hop artist is a tie between The Coup or Dead Prez but my favorite song atm is probably Lowkey's "You can't take my Soul".
**Triumph:** I don't immediately want to drink when things get bad. huzzah! it took constant work to recondition my brain but something happened in the past couple of weeks. during a stressful moment my mind goes to deep breathing and positive imagery instead of bathtubs full of wine. ..**Struggle:** I'm an introvert and really need to find some "me" time before I lose my shit. two of my dearest friends are getting divorced simultaneously and need a lot of support. I also manage five people in an open office and if I'm at my desk people treat it as an invitation to come talk. I want to be helpful but I'm totally drained. ..**General Nonsense:** can't stop listening to weird instrumental post-rock like Mogwai Explosions in the Sky This Will Destroy You Red Sparowes.....
Triumph: Got an offer for a new job and start tomorrow! After struggling through freelance gigs for the past year I am so excited for steady reliable income.  .Struggle: Migraines have been popping up in the afternoon which are never fun.  .General Nonsense: I'm a huge fan of punk rock (mid 90s So Cal). Strung Out is probably my fav.
TRIUMPH: Things are going better at work. I even got a raise before my annual review at the end of the year so I was very surprised. ..STRUGGLE: Figuring out school and other important things I've been procrastinating on. I need to find an outlet besides drinking..GENERAL NONESENSE: I absolutely love Breaking Benjamin and Red. \m/
TRIUMPH.Deciding to do the thing!..STRUGGLE.The monotony daily life..NONSENSE.I work in a high school. No shortage of nonsense...Shakey Graves. And up-and-coming awesome group And The Kids. Check them out...
Triumph:  I took my kids (age 2 and 4) on a 4 hour car trip yesterday and did not get angry or lose my temper once..Struggle:  I am starting to feel lousy on a day-in day-out basis.  I really really really don't want to admit that I may have a problem with depression; but maybe it's time.  I'm going to have a little time to exercise and be alone with the wife in the next couple of days so I'm sure that will help.  I know how to be an alcoholic.  I don't know how to be a depressed person..Nonsense:  Just got turned onto Portishead.  (I live under a rock.)
Triumph: I've gone to several events recently that had alcohol and not drinking felt so natural for me. I feel like being sober is really becoming part of my identity...Struggle: Ugh finals. ..General Nonsense: I'm really digging Muse and Radiohead right now. ..
Triumph - I passed my certification exam last thursday..Struggle - we had to put our dog down the same day for aggressive pancreatic cancer..General Nonsense - in my car rotating Breton (war room stories) Karnivool (sound awake) and Refused (the new noise anthology)
**Triumph:** feeling great looking forward to exercise tonite.   ..**Struggle:** i think deep down I'm lonely as fucking hell and my kids are my best friends lol. Last night Wife said a coworker told her "wow ospreysoaring seems like a really well rounded guy." Which isn't that uncommon a compliment...i love doing and learning things but homebody wife doesn't like me hanging with anybody outside her social circle and pitches fits if I want to engage in a hobby somewhere as "wasting time/shirking duties." Need to reconcile that.     ..**General Nonsense:** nothing really new or dedicated. Been rocking playlists on phone and certain songs bubble to top I can realky jive to....     .Depeche Mode - Clean.    .Lucius - Born Again Teen.   .Section25 - Looking from a Hilltop (classic EBM from '85 that showed what an 808 could do)   .New Order - Temptation.    .Kid Rock - American Badass.    .5Finger Death Punch - Jeckyll &amp; Hyde.    .Anything by Chvrches and The Chainsmokers.    .Getting into Schoolboy Q.I could go on
**HUMP DAAAIIIUUY**..No drinking last night or today I promise!
Triumph: Well I'm not drinking today so there's that!..Struggle: I got overwhelmed with a variety of things (work drama house drama family events) and went back to drinking thinking I'd have "just one or two" which is/was rarely ever the case. A little alarming how quickly I could just talk myself out of several weeks of good decisions in an instant instead of going straight to my support system as would have been healthy. Guess I should've seen it coming. ..Anyway didn't feel good fell out of my healthy routines I was building not worth it do not recommend reset my badge onward and upward. Trying to figure out what I'll do differently this time...General Nonsense: Really into Andrew Bird's new album 'Are you Serious?'. Love all his stuff though.
**Triumph:** The weather was very nice today. Spent most of the day out with friends :)..**Struggle:** I'm still pretty pissed (no pun intended) about having to do urine and blood tests for the next 6 months...**General Nonsense:** The starters for the new Pok mon games were revealed yesterday: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn25hijDL7c
**Triumph:** Made it through the move and didn't kill anyone...**Struggle:** Struggling with some depression and just had my first migraine.  I think these last couple of months have been harder on me than I thought...**Nonsense:** I really haven't been following music that much lately.  I definitely love me some Rusted Root though!
**Triumph :** I haven't done anything stupid/harmful to myself or others while drinking so far. It's a very small victory but I'm glad...**Struggle :** After a sober period of 21 days I started drinking in moderation again. It went great at first but now it's halfway through the third week and I'm already drinking too much too often. I'm really scared I can't do moderation anymore. I'm scared I'm gonna have to quit alcohol completely forever and I just can't see how...**General Nonsense :** The Octopus Project Tobacco and The Foals!
Triumph: Worked out even though I didn't feel like it. Finished grading I had to do. Made a difficult and awkward phone call. .Struggle: My landlords may not renew my lease at the worst time and I had to back out of an obligation which I'm feeling immense stress/guilt about. Very stressed this week. .General Nonsense: Has anyone else seen the DC Eagle Cam? I love them and they should be fledging soon: http://dceaglecam.org/ They are helping me heal ..Happy Wednesday everyone! I will not drink today. 
**Triumph:** I went on a long run today. I mentioned in a previous post how I've been tracking my progress: taking mental note of which driveway I make it to everytime I go up this long ass hill. Anyway today before my run I told myself "25mountains you *will* make it to the top of that hill without stopping. Forget about the next driveway; make it to the top of the freakin thing." I visualized myself doing it and well it happened! I had a personal Rocky moment at the top then continued on my merry way. Longest run I've been on since I started again. Took months to get to this point but I feel great. I'm proud of myself...**Struggle:** I'm trying to reconcile with a lot of mistakes I made in my past. I'm learning that though I *think* things I've said in the past will not come back to haunt me they do. And as much as I want to erase those things I realize it's not that easy. And it really sucks. I brushed a lot of stuff under the rug and it's all kind of gathered into a little monster of issues that I have to confront. To those of you early in recovery and in your first days like me and even to those of you lurking and considering taking the plunge just know that with every thing that gets better it seems like there's a thing that comes to counteract that and haunt you from your past. Stay strong though. The serenity prayer is really coming in handy these past few days...**General Nonsense:** Okay let's talk music. I'm digging the new Lumineers album. One of my favorite musicians is Andrew Bird. I've been revisiting some of the Shins catalog lately. Bright Eyes was HUGE for me growing up so I've been taking some nostalgia trips into his catalog too. I'm also really into this Australian gal named Courtney Barnett.
Triumph- I've been open and honest with those closest to me about my intent to quit drinking and I've only had love and support. Finding the community on here to be full of the GD greatest people in the world. And I seriously rocked it at my dress rehearsal last night (and said no when I was invited to the pub.)..Struggle- migraine today so was bed-ridden for most of the day. Went to babysit my beautiful niece with my mum grabbed some snacks on the way and thought I'd try alcohol free wine just to see if I liked it. Mistake. Didn't realise it had &lt;0.5% abv so isn't totally alcohol free. Lesson learned- always read the label. I had half a glassful before I realised- poured the rest away...General nonsense- super into Hamilton the musical. Also rediscovered Travis yesterday and fell in love again- their music always reminds me of my godfather who died when I was 11.
Triumph: Got a clean bill of health yesterday from my doctor. Everything checked out perfect with the exception of what cigarettes are doing. Overall my body is healthy. I took my dad to see The Jungle Book for his 60th birthday last night and it was fucking awesome! My old man's first 3D movie and he loved it. I love my little pit bull and I restrung my 12 string guitar after a year of putting it off...Struggle: I had a relapse dream last night that woke me up in a panic. Jumped up after hearing a loud bang and grabbed my dog. Scared the shit out of her. My wife and I are still undecided if we want to go through with a divorce but we are in counseling together. ..Nonsense:..Right now my favorite music is Folk/Americana. Really digging The Lumineer's new album. The song Sleep on the Floor really gets me motivated when I feel down. 
Triumph: Business continues in the right direction...Struggle: Youngest daughter has a sickness bug. Tomorrow's struggle will probably be the rest of the house has the sickness bug.....General nonsense: For a musician I listen to very little music. Currently into speech radio as I drive about during the day.
Triumph: I suspect I am in mid to late stage cirrhosis and I stopped drinking from Sunday..Has been 3 days and it already has been awesome. Got up earlier than ever went to gym and was this new confident person at work..Struggles: I miss out on networking as most people who I want to network look down upon me if I don't drink. Fuck them! I like the Sober me. 
I've gained weight since I quit drinking. Damn sugar cravings are getting the best of me.  Any advice?
T.  Finally got a decent grade on a microbio exam..S.  Time!.Gn.  The Beatles  white album.  Bjork...  anything by her.  The Knife.  
I'm late to the party oh well. ..Triumph: 3 weeks. And almost through the first part of work training. There is no way I would have able to survive this if I was drinking. Onwards and upwards!..Struggle: keeping my brain from focusing on other shit which hangs over me. It's not immediate; future shit best thing I can do is keep brain focused on sobriety day by day and worry about shit later--- but it's really difficult. Second panic attack since I quit was yesterday. ..Music:..[League of Highland Gentlemen - D p che M d ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP_e_eWvGks)
