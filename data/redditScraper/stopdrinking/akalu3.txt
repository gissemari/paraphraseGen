 I think my 14 years of alcoholism legal &amp; life dramas then becoming/fighting to be sober has kind of motivated me to want to help others suffering the same. I currently work in construction &amp; am undertaking study in that field but I'm considering studying a dual diploma in Alcohol &amp; Other drugs / Mental health next. Not at all in my field and wouldn't know a thing shout it (except my life experience) but I really want to help others even if it was just one day a week volunteering while the other days are at my usual job! Sooo has anybody used/ been motivated by their life experiences to help others struggling with the same addiction?
