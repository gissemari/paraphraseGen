So as of today I have 90 days and I have to say that my overall outlook on life has definitely improved over this time of being sober.  I have struggled with depression for a long time and it was made worse by always being drunk.  But now even when things aren't going that well I am able to actually think about them instead of wallowing in self-pity.  I still have the same problems as I have always had but now I can deal with them without just hiding in a bottle.  Thanks to everyone out there in the community.  I will not drink with you all today..Edit: I realize that my 60 day post was 25 days ago but that was just the day I picked up my chip.

90 is a seriously big deal. That's about where sober started to just be part of normal for me. Congratulations to you.
Congrats on the 90days! Can't wait to reach that number! As for today all that matters for now is that I will not drink.
Congratulations!!  Big Milestone!
Congratulations on your big day!! Not drinking with you today :-)
