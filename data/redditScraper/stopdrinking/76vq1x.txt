There is no shame in asking for help.  BTW you have just done so by posting here.  This is a disease and with any disease we need to seek out professional help.  There are many things that doctors and therapist can do to help you.  I sought out a LCSW at an addiction recovery center and it was the best thing I did.

When I hit my bottom I went to an NA meeting and spilled my guts to this old junkie who was committed enough to his own sobriety to chair a meeting during a snowstorm even though he figured no one else would show. He listened without judgement and saved my life. From there I migrated to AA because alcohol had become my drug of choice. In those rooms I have often felt ashamed of my behavior (when it's particularly shitty) but I have never felt judged. These days when I see someone come in thoroughly defeated what I feel for them is a glimmer of hope. When someone is so desperate that they are willing to do anything to get sober they usually succeed...Of course it's not the only path to recovery but for those who truly commit it works.
As outlined in the community guidelines we ask that you only post when sober. For this reason we had to remove your post. But we'll be here tomorrow if you want to come back then.
