Happy &amp; Safe New Year's to you all. I wanted to check in and give encouragement to all who are new and struggling. I quit FOR GOOD on Dec 18 last year and so have 378 days in my new life. I am so glad to have made it this far and will never go back to putting poison into my body and mind. I tried the Sober January in 2015 and made it 5 months and then Sober January in 2016 and made it 3.5 months...  I knew I had a problem with alcohol and tried to quit starting in 2001/2002 and was in so much despair for 15 years with my failed attempts...I read so many books to try to get to the bottom of it all went to counseling and read this site constantly. As far as books what has helped me a lot is "This Naked Mind" by Annie Grace. ..Anyway I'm going back to watching movies on this New Year's Eve -- staying in staying safe -- after making warm soup and bread for dinner along with some lime-mint-elderflower seltzer and later chai tea (with eggnog!) and ginger cookies.  I'll check in again soon and I do wish you all well... keep your spirits up because if I can do it YOU CAN TOO!!

Thanks for your words of support for others. I went through 2017 and 2018 without smoking any cigarettes. I hope to make it through 2019 without any alcohol either!
