So I had initially come here tonight to vent about work and AA and I was furiously typing out all my frustrations. I went to a 26 week Step Action group on Monday and I had all these reservations surrounding the program that I was here to whine about. ..But then it hit me. I had a moment of clarity where I realized that I did try being clean & sober without AA or NA back in 2006/2007. I relapsed when my sister tragically passed away and self-medicated the next 7 years. ..So then I started to think - well what can I do differently this time around? ..Well I can do this damn program that's what. ..Tonight I'm going back to the Step Action group which runs Mondays & Thursdays for the next 25 weeks. I am going to commit to doing this because I know I can't afford to lose my life by relapsing if I'm faced with tragedy again. And I will most certainly die if I relapse again. ..Tonight I'm choosing life. ..

That is how recovery works: action in fellowship.
Yes!  Recognizing what didn't work before and trying something new.  Glad to hear it!
Excellent. Whatever it takes right?
