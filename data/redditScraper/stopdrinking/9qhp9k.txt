The last few days my mom's been visiting.  She's a wonderful person but I used to drink wine  nearly every night with her and it's been harder than I expected seeing her drink and not participating. Yesterday this waiter kept trying to fill my wine glass too with comments like:  Are you sure not even a little?  and sad faces. It ticked me off but I stayed polite and repeatedly said  No  and didn't explain. I refused to explain or justify it. I made one grouchy comment to my mom at the beginning because she was starting to order a bottle of champagne (knowing that I'm not drinking now). I kind of snapped:  You know if you get that you'll be drinking it all right? Because I'm not drinking anymore remember?!  And also made kind of a snarky comment about alcohol packing on weight which I think was uncalled for. It's just hard feeling like I can't participate in this social aspect of drinking and being stigmatized for it. I don't even really miss the taste or experience at the moment but it's just unpleasant feeling like people are implying you can't be fun or loosen up because you don't want to drink. This may really be all my interpretation and not about their actual impressions of my not drinking but it frustrates me. The same waiter ended up hitting on me at the end of the night and I was internally thinking:  Seriously life? Because someone pressuring me to drink is the last thing I need regularly in my existence right now so why is this happening?  I want to attract people who are supportive and I'm scared it may never happen. I have a real talent for pulling people who will drag me down or encourage me to waste my time. It isn't usually that apparent immediately so I guess that at least was a blessing. ..Just needed to vent folks. ..IWNDWYT awesome fellow sobernauts!

&gt;Yesterday this waiter kept trying to fill my wine glass too..Sober ProTip: when dining out turn your wineglass upside-down... this is like a secret signal to any server worth their salt who *should* in theory whisk it away without a word.....That particular waiter you describe sounds like a dick not to put too fine a point on it!..It gets significantly easier as time goes on you're doing great so keep going!!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Wow my mother alway is such a huge trigger for me. And as you say you have had some wonderful times drinking together...Even just speaking to my mum on the phone makes me want to drink. It is also because my mother has been drinking daily for over 60 years! She's 83 now and starting to lose some marbles but the point is for me I learnt to be ultra on my guard because I know how triggering us talking together can be for me...Anyways it's far better to vent with us than turning back to booze so well done you!..Concerning social occasions we can be a bit too over sensitive to what we may think others are thinking. When people start getting drunk they don't even notice what you are doing imho...A tip I used when going to a pub and was offered beers was to say; "Oh sorry I can't: bloody antibiotics but a diet coke no ice would be great!".
