I hope this the last time this relapse has been painful I've resorted to drinking listerene cooking extracts and trying hand sanitizer. I might very likely lose my job but everything happen for a reason right.... feeling low and depressed but I hope this is it. I've done it for 2.5 years before I can do again.... thanks guys
