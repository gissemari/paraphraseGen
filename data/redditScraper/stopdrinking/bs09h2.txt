I told my wife after 2 years of my struggle. She was surprisingly understanding.  Seriously it dosent sound like much but this is the biggest step I've taken even.

It was the same for me but it took a trip to the ER for me to talk about. Good for you feels good doesn't it?
Absolutely - was a key factor in my success this time around. We have only mentioned it a few times since but knowing that my wife knows was a very liberating feeling.
Lucky your wife is supportive... my now ex said I was a sneaky weak liar. And if he ever found out I was drinking again even moderately he would end it. .I am not drinking now but I think gee what an ass thanks for the support   .Love your wife you've been brave.  IWNDWYT
I'm proud of you!  Telling my girlfriend was a big step for me. I'm rooting for you!
Telling my wife was the first step in actually stopping. After I told her I felt like I had so much more power over alcohol. Like another person said it was liberating.
Great victory! Congrats.
I did the same thing at the start of this year and it was a huge help! She's been supportive and has quit with me (even though she didn't drink much). It has helped to keep me honest. It's scary I know...you can't go back...but really it's for the best!
