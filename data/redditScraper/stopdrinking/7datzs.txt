That buzz. That feeling of superiority. That feeling that no matter what it's gonna be all ok...I'm sitting here with a FREEZING pint of Stella.  It's hard to swallow for the 10th time tonight. Conversation isn't flowing the ones that at are wondering what's wrong with them well.... The others snuggle into their BOYFRIENDS.  Everyone else? Looking at their phones (including me). ..I was sober 2.5 years my life was incredible. This year the last 6 months I wondered what if? Maybe I'm wrong... Maybe  my friends/family overreacted.  They didn't...I struggle with alcohol I am funny I am sensitive but I have people that make me question my ethics...Take out school god and everything in between maybe I should be a better person. Scratch that. I want to be a better person. Bottle down now. Positive energy elsewhere...

Drinking never works. Boy if it worked like I think it would it would be magic in a bottle. Unfortunately it's just deceptive poison. I imagine you know where it leads if you crack that egg. 
"Let's be honest"..&gt;That buzz. That feeling of superiority. That feeling that no matter what it's gonna be all ok...Alright - *Honest* as you mentioned...All the characteristics described were lies.  To exacerbate the issue after the empty promises that my mind told me came the regret remorse and guilt..."I have people that make me question my ethics"..I'm intrigued!  Can you elaborate?....
Are you sober now?
