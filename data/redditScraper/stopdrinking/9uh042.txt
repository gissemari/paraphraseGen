I'm depressed today. Visiting family across the country and I don't have my usual coping mechanisms here that I have at home. This visit is stressful. Just needed to share. IWNDWYT!

Well if it isn't too much bother could you elaborate a bit?  Specifically which coping mechanisms were at home that you don't have with you?..I have an upcoming out of town family visit and I'm totally freaked out about it.  Working on a list already.  Taking everything with me except the kitchen sink.  Still feel like I'm going to be unprepared for the stress...Maybe there's something we could do to fortify ourselves that we haven't thought of...
Uhgg.  I hate that too.  It is one of my mahor triggers.  I go late and leave early.  My trouble is when I get home I want a reward for putting up and getting through the visit.  Do everything you are able to distract yourself. Mine is eating whatever I want.  I also have some good reading material and just get in my car and head to Star Bucks if I get too "crowded".  I wish you well.
