100 days ago I decided to get sober. Most days since I've logged on to /r/stopdrinking and written down my thoughts. It's probably impossible for me to think of a single decision that has had a more positive impact on my life...I share my story in the hopes that folks here will relate and anyone who's on the fence will take the first step to living the sober lifestyle and as a tribute to those of us who are struggling to stay on the path.  This is also the culmination of a writing project I've been working on that I intend as a thank you to the /r/stopdrinking community not just for your relentless positivity but also for making relentless positivity look appealing enough for a curmudgeon like me to embrace it fully. ..**How I Got There**..Drinking started for me in college and intensified as I moved to a new city to start my life as a professional.  Suddenly 10 years passed and I was an adult with a 401k who was still binge drinking every weekend.  I'd come to terms with the fact that I had a drinking problem years ago during those 10 years but always managed to come up with a reason not to quit--I'd moderate I'd quit eventually drinking was too fundamental to my identity to abandon or I'd just eventually end up killing myself and that would be that.  My life didn't have much value to me; what mattered was keeping myself numb. ..By the time I was 30 every weekend (often beginning on Wednesday or Thursday night and ending Monday morning) began with vodka consisted of cathartic oblivion and ended with a crippling hangover through which I could vaguely pantomime an imitation of a functioning adult. It didn't start like that but it ended that way. Of course it wasn't always that bad but after 10 years of a professional existence where I could get away with it it eventually became not just the norm but seemingly necessary. The anxiety I felt when I wasn't drinking went hand-in-hand with the exquisite planning and care I put into arranging my next binge. I hid this from everyone I could with varied success but on paper I was a functioning and talented professional with a good job.  On the inside I was nauseous aching fearful tasting bile--miserable...I knew intellectually that I couldn't possibly keep up the drinking financially or in terms of my health. The drinking was actively limiting my ambitions professionally and in terms of hobbies friends and potential romantic partners. I was completely miserable and unhealthy and if I looked at my life honestly I couldn't see myself being anywhere but dead in five years--a wish that was almost granted when I was diagnosed with cancer at 28--which was quickly cured after which I immediately went back to drinking. I spent weeks out of the year unable to walk from gout attacks I blamed on the cancer treatment--when I knew it was really from the drinking. ..I lazily hopped from one embarrassing weekend to the next blasting my brain cells so I wouldn't have to contemplate the wages of my actions while drunk or hungover. Every morning was a miserable slog through what I maybe had done and every commute was a terrifying totaling of sums in thick cognitive fog. I wouldn't say I was suicidal exactly just convinced that my life had no prospects because I was locked into a cycle of eliminating self-reflection with oblivion--always followed by days of miserable anxiety before starting another binge. I have memories of a cognitive dissonance so extreme that I would watch myself like a stranger looking through my own eyes buying another bottle of Grey Goose on a Saturday night to continue a binge I knew I couldn't afford--in terms of money my health or my sanity. I'd cancel trips get out of obligations and avoid all contact with people in order to prolong the time I could spend out of my mind alone in my apartment. Why? I thought I deserved it needed it and didn't want to face life without it. I was a servant to the binges and my life's direction was determined by the inertia and hopelessness that follows when a man abandons his own agency...I was remarkably talented (but not nearly as talented as I thought I was) at keeping the depth and severity of my problem from everyone around me while meeting my obligations professionally so I convinced myself it didn't matter because this was the only way I could exist. I could manage to maintain a veneer of functionality so how I felt didn't matter. A small handful of friends were honest--but most people at least tolerated me when they weren't actively encouraging or enabling me...**Why I Quit**..In late summer of this year I took an honest inventory of myself and saw only a bad pitiable person.  I used my intelligence the high stakes in my work and my exceptional qualities to justify a sickness that was eating me alive. Every day began with unbearable anxiety and ended with cognitive oblivion and one replaced the other in a constant cycle that felt like a prison. There was **nothing** to look forward to but a longer binge that would continue the cycle. Ultimately the fact is I didn't want to stop because for all my ego creativity and intelligence I couldn't conceive of an alternative to that cycle. Most importantly though I didn't want to stop because I didn't think I was worth it and I lazily accepted that constant hazy misery was the only reasonable way to live in a world so fucked up. I never seriously considered the idea that my problems were my own and sabotaging my own life was not a constructive approach to the--admittedly fucked up--problems around me...Compared to my previous drinking escapades this summer was rather uneventful. I didn't do anything particularly objectionable. I didn't drunkenly slice my hand open on a broken mason jar while careening over a fence (again) I didn't throw friends out of a party after accusing them of plotting against me (again) I didn't shatter my skull on the tile floor of a bar (again) and I did not even order $200 of food at 1am twice in a row stiff the delivery person and then wake up with my head in a pizza box (again).  There was no waking up in prison no wrapping my car around a tollbooth and no dramatic moment where I screamed in the rain. ..There was just a quiet moment of honesty with myself on the subway. I spent some time on /r/stopdrinking and did some reading notably of Bill Corbett's and Chris Hardwick's experiences with alcohol.  I'd done both before to no avail but this time a logic switch in my brain flipped. I realized that I wanted to stop drinking because of the possibilities such a move would open up--and the fact that there seemed to be nowhere to go but up.  I guess a quiet moment alone with myself was my "rock bottom." And if I'm honest quiet moments alone with myself were part of what I had been trying to avoid by drinking...I made the decision that life might be worth not just hazily stumbling through but actually experiencing. I realized that I could go to work Monday morning without crippling anxiety and NOT spend Sunday night terrified of things I might have said or done during a blackout. I could interact with my friends without worrying that I'd said or done something to hate myself over. I could remember every conversation I had and imbue those conversations with meaning they would never have had when I was drunk. I could make plans that were more than half-baked ideas born in drunken mania and forgotten in a hangover the next day. If I stopped drinking I could work toward living without hating myself and hating the world. Maybe I could even get into shape or get another chance at loving someone. Suddenly life looked a lot more appealing...I've mentally compared the change in my thinking to a religious conversion without the religion. My life and experience have undergone a complete transformation without alcohol.  But more importantly I think is that the desire for alcohol is gone because now I've had the chance to see the promise that sobriety holds. And it's pretty fucking impressive promise...**Where I Am Now**..After 100 days I can hardly believe how much better I feel. The physical changes have been dramatic.  I've dropped 32 pounds in 100 days lost some of the bags under my eyes resumed trimming my beard regularly and even relearned to brush my teeth without retching. I sleep like a normal human being pleasantly wrapped in a comforter with my head on a dry cool pillow. When I walk up a flight of stairs I'm not winded instead I feel a bounce in my step.  I feel young...My credit score has gone up by 50 points. I spend my weekends being active in my community. I always know what I've said and to whom and what I've done and why--and where I want to go next and who I want to work toward being. Everything is clearer. I am slower to anger--friends and family have made it clear that I'm infinitely more pleasant to be around.  I can be angry without uncontrollable rage; I can be excited without mania. Sobriety has also bestowed astonishing discipline I recoil from procrastination and lean in toward moderation in all things. I'm better at my job and even at video games. I feel like the promise of my life is finally being fulfilled--I'm writing again and today I caught up with an old professor and was able to tell him honestly--my life is going great and I'm genuinely enjoying it. ..The world is still appalling--that certainly hasn't changed. But when I wake up in the morning and go to bed at night I know for sure that I'm not the reason it is and that I'll have the strength to handle whatever nonsense it throws at me.  I'm still me I'm just a better me...tl;dr: I used to drink way too much and I stopped 100 days ago.  Best decision ever.  You should totally do it...Thanks SD.

This is totally amazing.  ..&gt; By the time I was 30 every weekend (often beginning on Wednesday or Thursday night and ending Monday morning) began with vodka consisted of cathartic oblivion and ended with a crippling hangover through which I could vaguely pantomime an imitation of a functioning adult...I could've written this myself.  I didn't think of them as binges.  I did it until I was 38 years old.  I'm glad you're getting so many benefits in your life.  I won't drink with you today!..By the way have you considered making this a Saturday Share?  If you do just mod mail the mods and ask to have this made into a Saturday Share.  It'll get 'flared' and then kept in the 'Saturday Share' sidebar for posterity.
Congratulations! I loved reading this! Thanks for sharing! 
You are a really good writer. You have expressed a lot of how I am feeling in a much more articulate way. I too was stuck in that miserable cycle of poor work performance anxiety anticipating and planning my nightly binges and then going all out everynight- just to wake up and do it again. Alcohol took away my ability to enjoy everything else and made me unmotivated to try and find anything else to enjoy. Its good to be back in the world- even if it is still fucked up.
tl;dr:  Congrats on 100 days
You write well.  I really like the Why I Quit section.  You mentally prepared for this.  Was there anything else?  How did you handle the anxiety?  Thanks for sharing this and congrats on 100 days.
