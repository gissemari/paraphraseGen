While my badge says 140 days the truth is that I have been on off benders for the last couple months.  I went back to my old job as a bartender thinking I could handle the late night surroundings and avoid temptation.  While I have avoided many of the troubles alcohol has led me to in the past I still find myself reverting back to old behaviors.  My brother's wedding was this past week and I was able to hold it together long enough to fulfill my duties as best man and deliver that speech on his big day.  A large part of my family struggles with alcohol especially my cousin.  My uncle told me that he no longer enjoys being around his son and that he has to look at baby pictures in order to remember the child he once loved.  I crept into my room and broke down immediately because I never want my family to feel that way about me.  I want to be a better friend brother and son to those who love me and no bottle in the world is worth giving that up.  Time to reset.

Admitting we slipped is hard &amp; I'm proud of you for doing it.  Even if you think you messed everything else up if you got thru the day sober it was a great day.  That was where I needed to start.
Wow. What a way to come back. Welcome back friend. 
A powerful post. My best wishes to you.
Welcome back. Every day gets better when you are going in the right direction.
