So you want a night of sloppiness you cant remember followed by a day of pain nausea anxiety zero productivity and poor dietary choices. Drink. The fun comes from preparation it comes from the going to the shop the breaking up the ice the clink of the bottles. The fun is the nostalgia of party's and to a time where it worked in blocking out my pain. The fun does not come from being drunk. Its a here we are again and nothings changed feeling. A cold beer is a trick it never refreshes me like I remember and it certainly dosnt taste better than a ginger ale or a fruit juice.

THANK YOU. **I should read at least one post like this every day.** Quite many of us probably should...I'm glad you're back.
So glad to read this post this am. I can always feel a relapse coming on a day or two before- this helped me a lot this am!
Great post to come back to again and again
Keep coming back.  
&gt;A cold beer is a trick..As the Who sang - [Won't Get Fooled Again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYMD_W_r3Fg).
i'm in the same boat and beating myself up right now - really helpful to hear how you're turning that feeling around.  thank you!  IWNDWYT 
"... and to a time where it WORKED..." man that is the key of all keys. When all else fails i need to remind myself that at some point the alcohol stopped working. 
Good point - I sometimes try to recapture the fun times I had drinking 15 to 25 years ago. I can't recapture that. I guess I ruined it by overdoing it 
All true...How long did you go before relapsing?
&gt; The fun comes from preparation it comes from the going to the shop the breaking up the ice the clink of the bottles. The fun is the nostalgia of party's and to a time where it worked in blocking out my pain. ..I read somewhere that when planning a vacation the anticipation of the vacation is more satisfying and exciting than the actual vacation for many people. ..I totally get what you are saying with this statement and you romanticized the nostalgia very well. Then you wake up right?..Glad you are back and thanks for sharing your research! Happy to stay sober with you today.
I second you on the ginger ale or juice!  Once I broke the brainwashing and really looked at it the taste of (all types of) booze really does suck. Bring on a ginger ale over crushed ice!  I will not drink with you today.
