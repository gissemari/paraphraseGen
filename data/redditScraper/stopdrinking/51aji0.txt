I have been lurking around here for months and just recently everything came to a head..Girlfriend of 9 months just left me struggling financially job seems to get harder and harder each day. Fell out of a contract on a house. I feel so out of shape and lame around friends and family. Life kinda sucks right now...Drinking has seemed to be the easy way out but I know the path to a better healthier and even cheaper lifestyle will come from stopping drinking...It's just too bad I like craft beer so much. ..I know I will feel better. Today is that day. No more beer no more wine no more liquor...Advice is always appreciated. You guys are awesome.

Welcome home man. I'm proud of you...I'm on day II and the withdrawals are bad but finding this place has given me hope. Today is the first day of the rest of your life. ..I'm here for you.
Glad you are here.  I started reading The Naked Mind the other day. There is a link in the side bar and it is free. It really helps to put into perspective just how bad alcohol is for me.  They just kind of shredded all of the reasons I thought I drank (stress relaxing for fun etc.) and talked about it truthfully. Well worth taking a look at.  ..This place really is a great place for support. 
I really love beer too I feel you. Unfortunately a little too much. Congrats on making your decision. Today I won't drink with you :) 
I'm only a few days ahead of you and I really feel that this time I have a chance.  The people here are great.  I have connected with both veterans and newbies. It has been my life line..Hope to see you back tomorrow so we can not drink together!
