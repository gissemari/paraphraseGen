There are some layers to this and I am on mobile so I apologize for any rambling or formatting issues. ..We've been married for 1.5 years together for six. I've always had a drinking problem and he's been along for the worst of it. In addition to substance abuse I'm also pretty bad with money. I have student loan debt a 401K loan and personal loans to pay off consumer debt totaling near $80000...I've been thinking about inpatient care on and off for years now and I brought it up with my therapist and one of my managers yesterday to further look into what this decision would look like regarding work etc. I've been working with outpatient care therapy and medication to better myself but I'm struggling. I feel very alone and overwhelmed so I think if I went through a 30 day program in which I focused on nothing but myself and getting sober things might actually start changing for me. I'm very depressed and every passing day I think more and more about just ending it. My therapist encouraged me to talk about it with my husband and get the ball rolling if I was really serious about it. So when I got home that's what I did. The very first thing he said was "We can't afford it." The conversation was frustrating and short-lived. I looked into it a little bit by myself with insurance coverage and different facilities then cried myself to sleep. ..A little more background on the financial situation: last summer I came clean to my husband about my issues with credit card use. He was furious especially since I didn't tell him before we got married. About two years before we got married we took out a personal loan together to pay off my credit cards which I paid entirely on time about six months before the wedding. So when I told him last summer about it it wasn't really new news because he did know that I had overspending issues before.  This solution was obviously not a solution at all but just a temporary fix. It didn't stop my spending. The confrontation lead to a relapse after 230 days sober and I haven't been sober for nearly as long since. ..I want to get better and I am motivated to get better but I just feel like I can't do it alone and without the extra tone and help that I'm interested in getting. All he sees at this point is the increasing debt this time being medical. And I get it but at the same time I feel like I need this. ..Thanks so much for taking the time to read and offering any thoughts or advice. I love this sub.

Wow you made it to 230 days sober? That's wonderful! What habits methods of thinking changes in beliefs etc. led to you being able to get the long consistently without drinking?
I went to intensive outpatient rehab and it worked great most insurance companies make you try that first. Maybe a good compromise?
