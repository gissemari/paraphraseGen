Last time I had 7 months without drinking the truth is had two streaks of 3 and a half months divided by a two-day relapse. But I was still telling everyone I had 7 months dry...This time it's actually been seven months without a drink (following a pretty extreme relapse). I don't want to get too excited because I can't see the future but I do feel glad that I've made it this long...I don't really have many friends in real life to talk about this with so I figured I'd mention it to you SD!..I really hope to make it to a year just one day at a time. Wouldn't that be wonderful-- a whole year without booze!..This sub helps me A LOT-- I read it every day. Usually multiple times a day. So thank you guys. I really don't think I could have done it without you...Endurance and warmth to all of you...Saludos :)

:) 7 months of sobriety. No blips to hide just fucking 7 months of straight sober. Love it!
That's fantastic and an inspiration too as it seems soooo far away! I am very thankful to have found SD. I check in every day and read all the posts. It's keeping me honest and accountable as I too have swept the occasional indiscretion under the mat...like nobody knew...really! Keep up the good work one day at a time. I will celebrate your success by not taking a drink today.
Congratulations! Great job!
