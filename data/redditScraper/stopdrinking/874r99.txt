Hey all I posted on my other account (since deleted after discovered IRL) about my step dad who was diagnosed with liver cancer. I had 61 days and slipped when we got the news. Back at 23 days now and in those 23 days it's gotten worse. They stopped treatment today and he's on comfort care now. My mom is with him and I'm giving her her space but I'm struggling with accepting that there's nothing I can do. I basically feel like a lunatic chanting the serenity prayer to myself because in this situation it's absolutely accurate and I know no one gets to keep their parents forever but it fucking sucks. I'm not drinking because I know my desire is self centered and self serving. I just need good vibes or encouragement or something. IWNDWYT.

(((hugs))) Sorry you are going through a tough time.
Yes it sucks to lose a family member.  Sorry to hear you re going through this.  Hang in there the best you can.
Hang in there and remember alcohol doesn't ever make anything better it just gives you something else to regret!  You will be so glad if you remember being fully present for your mother and your step dad through this and not off hiding in some bottle.  I feel for you all and I will not drink with you today.  
I'm so sorry. Please take good care of yourself and your mom. She'll be grateful that you're sober and present for her in this time. Losing someone so close to you is very very freaking hard. Be proud of those 24 days protect your sobriety. I hope that's encouraging.
