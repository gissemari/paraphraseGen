I am a long time reddit user but it's time to explore and address my dark side and get it to see the light again.   I've been in the shadows too long with this.   Not even my wife knows how deep the rabbit hole goes...As I type this I long for the bottle of wine that is sitting on my filing cabinet.   I have had at least one bottle a day for the last couple of weeks.   And I've taken more than one long lunch break a week for the last 5-6 weeks that involve a couple of very large top-shelf margaritas each time...I've been fooling myself into thinking that I had things under control.   The bartender knows to cut me off after two.   And if my wife doesn't suspect anything and I am able to function in my job without anyone noticing then I must be doing something right.  At least that's what I thought until yesterday afternoon when I almost fell asleep behind the wheel after one of those long lunch breaks.   It was just a split second.   The tire bumped the lane divider and jolted me back to alertness.   I promptly exited parked and took a catnap.   Someone is looking out for me.   That has never happened before in over 34 years of often irresponsible drinking (I started when I was 14 - cutting classes chugging on a bottle of Jack Daniels that to this day I can't recall how I managed to get)...We all have those defining incidents that wake us up to our problems.   Aside from yesterday's near-death incident about a year ago it was almost the loss of my marriage because my wife caught on to the fact that I was sneaking out at night to pick up a six pack of beer to consume after she went to bed.    I made every excuse I could for my snoring until one evening she found the receipt for the convenience store and noted the day and time of the purchase.   I was able to drop cold turkey for 90 days.   Then I began to casually introduce "socially" over the last 6-8 months.   Well that has gone full relapse now.   I drink practically every day (at least I did - haven't had anything in the last 24 hours but I can't guarantee I won't "purge" that last bottle from the house - trying desperately to keep myself occupied with reddit as a distraction)...Why am I at this point again?   Like many I have an addictive personality.   And it's not just with food and drink but also my hobbies.   I tend to go all out no matter what I choose to do good or bad.   But I suspect I can fix much of that if I am able to get a clear head again.  We shall see.

Welcome! I've found this community to be an incredibly helpful resource for committing to sobriety. You made the right choice posting here...People asked me this question when I first showed up so I'll ask it of you:..What are you going to do differently this time so you don't just complete 90 (or however many) days sober and then get yourself into the same mess again?
Come get addicted to sobriety friend ! Welcome !
