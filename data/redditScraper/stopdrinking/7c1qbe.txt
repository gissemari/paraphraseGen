"*Cognitive dissonance refers to a situation involving conflicting attitudes beliefs or behaviors. This produces a feeling of discomfort leading to an alteration in one of the attitudes beliefs or behaviors to reduce the discomfort and restore balance etc.*"..I write this post both in gratitude to the people of SD and also in the hope of reaching a subset of people that I know are here quietly observing.  You are the people who like me 100 days ago are struggling with the conflicted feelings of:..- on the one hand  other people's stories about DUI's blackouts losing jobs etc don't resonate with my experiences so perhaps I don't have a problem ..- on the other hand  I am not feeling comfortable with how many times I wake up promising myself I won't drink today only to frequently find a good reason 10-12 hours later why it's OK to have a drink today.   A drink  that turns into 4 or 6 or ....**That's cognitive dissonance.**..You might also be struggling with the label  alcoholic  a term that comes with a certain stigma and a stereotype that you don't feel you meet.  Yet you are increasingly uncomfortable with your relationship with alcohol and are concerned you might be at a potential tipping point...**That's cognitive dissonance.**..That was me and if you recognise yourself in the above to you I would say that the notion that you need to  find your own bottom  isn't always true.  You can grab control and take decisive action before then.  You can avoid getting to that point.   I feel today that I have accomplished that and have set a new permanent direction for myself.  Two powerful resources helped me to do so:..1)	For me the first half of This Naked Mind was a lightbulb moment.  It just flicked a switch in my attitude to alcohol and helped me to understand our societal and personal relationship with alcohol so much more clearly.   Armed with that understanding the cognitive dissonance I had been wrestling with just melted away and the battle to change my habits become much easier...2)	This group.  To everyone else here your selfless sharing of your struggles triumphs and experiences have powered me through 100 days.  I thank you wholeheartedly.  This is surely the very definition of a support group.  I will continue to visit here daily...Some here share their experience of a massive transformation in their lives once they stop drinking.  I don't have that to share but I have undoubtedly emerged from 100 days a better and happier person with perhaps 100 smaller upsides as a result.  If you are interested then I will share a few highlights:..-	I am coping with **stress** so much better.  Alcohol never helped me de-stress.  It merely numbed it for an evening after which I'd wake up to greater stress because a) I'd taken no affirmative action to resolve whatever I was stressed over and b) because that's another morning I'm chastising myself for drinking when I promised myself I wouldn't..-	My **performance** has improved across so many facets; work parenting my running hobby as a husband.  I won't pretend I'm twice as good at everything but I am better in all areas.  I'm more rested more focussed and more present..-	The **crappy memory** that I have always had is notably better.  I just thought that was me a guy who needed to make notes about everything because his memory was poor or his attention span weak.  At 43 I am definitely more able to remember detail that I ever was...-	My self diagnosed **early onset arthritis** has vanished.  It's no longer painful to open a tight jar or to squeeze a fist.  I don't know why perhaps minor gout or some other joint inflammation but it's definitively gone...-	My **self esteem** is greatly improved.  I feel like I am in control now and have achieved something.  That is powerful..-	And I feel so **healthy**.  I sleep so well.  For decades and decades I would regularly be awake reading for an hour or two (mostly on days where I hadn't drank of course) and sometimes longer.  Again that's just something I accepted as normal.  Not so.  In fact I'm frustrated that I often don't get more than a couple of pages into my book because I do love to read.  I have more energy I am more likely to exercise and enjoy the benefits of that. ....So that's my story.  It's not terribly interesting and there are no shocking stories or heart rending experiences to share.  I haven't overcome great adversity. I'm just a bloke who felt himself ever so gradually slipping a little more and more over many years.  Despite the lack of a full blown physical addiction it wasn't easy to break those habits especially when they are so ingrained into the drinking and pub culture we have here in the UK.  But it has been so very very much worth it and I hope that my sharing will help other people who were in the position I was in 100 days ago wresting with your own **cognitive dissonance** and unsure what to do...

Awesome post!  IWNDWYT 
Great post. Thanks!
So with you on so many points (including approximate number of days). Congrats and lets keep it going     
Thank you for sharing your improvements!  It helps me to have such things to look forward to especially in the self-diagnosed arthritis department.  I'm finally coming out of the fog and in this for the long haul.
Awesome! I can't wait to get to 100! Good job
You articulated so well what I have experienced man. Thank you. 
This is similar to what I found in my first hundred days. This includes my back and neck pain that went away. Why would I ever want to go back to that?  So I kept sober to find more benefits. Hoping you'll find the same. It gets better and easier. Rooting for you.   
Good stuff. Now you have your ton keep your concentration.
