Why the hell not come by to celebrate and say thanks for the support in reaching 78 days? I had a lot of rough ones getting here and today was just really splendid. There will be other shitty days ones in which I may come by here to complain and vent; why not come by to spread some positivity? It seems worth making a post to say things are good right now in this moment and I'm really grateful for all of you...I lurk a lot and I really appreciate you taking the time to share your stories struggles strategies and solutions with your internet friends. There's a lot of wisdom in you...I'm off to pick up some mail from my old place and then head to an AA meeting with the hopes that I won't walk out of it wanting to drink but if I do wanna guzzle I know how to handle it now. Today I took the long walk home to smell raspberry bushes and stare at the trees and I just simply felt nice. It was rad. I haven't simply felt nice in a long ass time.
