Hi guys. I'm living in Melbourne Australia and am struggling to find some accommodation with sober people since I've been in Rehab. I was wondering if there's anyone living in my city that can direct me towards some advice. I've been on the waiting list for supported accommodation for 9 months now and I  have concerns about moving into boarding houses because I've heard they are full of drugs and alcohol. Any advice would be greatly appreciated as who and where I live with will play a massive roll in my on-going recovery. Thanks and IWNDWYT
