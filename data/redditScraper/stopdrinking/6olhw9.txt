Ok this is a just a rather dull vent im sorry  but I'd welcome any helpful hints on how to manage a little better please. I had 3 drinks between jan and march. Nothing since. It was sort of unintentional that I quit well that's my story anyway! Mum is visiting haven't seen her for 2 years from 5000 miles away. We've drunk together for 20 years now I'm not. I'm sensing I'm being a little uptight and she's finding it weird that I won't join her. It's stalling the whole 'having a nice time together' stuff and I'm struggling to make it happen and feel good about her being here. im desperately trying not to be selfish about it but she doesn't seem happy for me. I'm so happy for me. And that's not going to change. But how do i loosen up a little and chill with her without booze??
