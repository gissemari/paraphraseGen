Something I've noticed lately here kind of has me irked. Who the hell down votes anything posted to SD? I can understand that we are not all going to agree on things all the time but seriously? Why? Are there people here that insecure that consider non-affirming people who are struggling a worthwhile thing to do?  Make me understand this mindset.

I always try not to read to much into the points. I don't know who or why I've been downvoted however I'm certainly capable of making up fascinating stories which probably have no basis in reality - Jez it could be someone who's drunk family member has disappointed them again  it could be another sobernaut who failed to get soberity on a similar path I've chosen people may not like my language being fairly enamored with the word fuck in all its forms - hell someone may of put their phone in their pocket without putting it to screen and pocket down voted me. ..I could waste an inordinate amount of time wondering why a number on a screen is going down or I could choose to ensure I'm speaking from the I and that my words are written to encourage others who are struggling with an addiction that currently our society puts on a pedestal!
Just a thought...  I down voted somebody the other day totally by accident on my iPad Mini due to the "fat finger syndrome".  I think I was able to correct it but I'm not sure.
Eh people are gonna peep.  :)  I try to keep in mind that I have no idea what is going on in someone's life when they react negatively to others; I just try (as hard as it is sometimes) to have compassion for them.
