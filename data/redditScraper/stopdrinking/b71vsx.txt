This is the first time I've ever needed medical help due to drinking. I had 3 years through a combo of AA and white knuckling. Relapsed a couple of years ago was able to stop during pregnancy. In the past 6 months longest I've been able to go is a couple of days. ..I got lightheaded in the store today and went to a walk-in clinic. My BP is 168/110 so they sent me here to the ER because of my BP high heart rate blurred vision and shaking...I can't believe this is happening. I'm a single mom but have a good job and a nice new boyfriend who has no clue that I go home from our dates where I've had 2 glasses of wine to polish off another couple of bottles and top it off with vodka...Not sure what's going to happen next but I can't do this alone.
