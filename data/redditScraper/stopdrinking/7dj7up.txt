I was reading through here wondering if I would contribute something when a friend rang through. .We have both struggled with alcohol and have touched on it before. I was having trouble communicating how I have been thinking and feeling with people close to me. Granted I have only been sober 4 days this time around..The convo lasted 2 hours and as we were hanging up he thanked me for being there. I had to thank him right back because he gets it. it's effortless to talk about what I am going through because he gets it. and I get it. I realized its not everyone's job to understand and how important it is to have people that do. .So here is to sober convos at midnight about being pissed and sad and laughing at it at the same time. .Keep talking everyone! Happy to be around here.

You are lucky to have a friend like that!
I have come to realize that "coincidences" like well-timed phone calls are a normal part of my everyday life and for that I am tremendously grateful. Thanks for you post!
Fantastic!..This is the essential element on which AA is founded: "I can't stay sober.  You can't stay sober.  Together We can stay sober."
