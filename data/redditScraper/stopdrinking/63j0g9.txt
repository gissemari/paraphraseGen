Hey folks been lurking here for a few months. I was in inpatient last year in August and relapsed about a month after. It was a rough couple of months to end the year. Someone in treatment told me that it's like an elevator that only goes down and you can get off at any time. This was quite true in my case I got back on that thing and went strait down. I have tremendous gratitude for my mom who happened to be visiting over the holidays. She saw how bad I was even though I was trying to hide it (like that ever works) and saw my onset of withdrawals the last morning. She took me into detox where I got a lot of help from a counselor who made sure my insurance was sorted out and I had outpatient scheduled before I left. ..This time after actually admitting defeat and actually trying to improve myself while helping others life is good. I've been in outpatient where I'm opening up and meeting people I can trust. I forced myself to go to meetings until I started to enjoy going to meetings. Got a sponsor who is insightful and genuine. And discovered one of my biggest fears about sobriety was just being a dry drunk. I thought it would be impossible for me to be happy or kind without that liquid courage and problem solver...Anyways I'll be here not drinking with all of you. Thanks for being there for one another and being there for lurkers like me who get a lot out of just reading the posts on here. Peace and love

Fellow lurker here. Mad respect. I am a big fan of the elevator metaphor too (it makes a ton of sense to me). Congrats! I won't drink with you today or tomorrow.
Great job on 90 days! A huge accomplishment.
Happy 90 Days!  That's really great.  I will not drink with you today.
Congrats on 90 days. I won't drink with you today.
