Today was one of those days. Currently I'm studying for mid year exams struggling to pay rent/food so a real barrel of laughs but doing it sober. There were moments today all I could think was scotch scotch scotch but I stopped and realised what I had to loose and so just went about my day clenching my fists but better that than waking up tomorrow hung over regretful and right where I was in the first place. Sorry for the pointless rant just needed to get it of my chest. Thanks SD. I will not drink today!!!

Congrats on riding it through and not picking up a drink. Stress drinking was what got me in trouble for years. It'll take a while to retrain your brain to look for healthier outlets for stress. Exercise and meditation does the trick for me - I hope you find what works for you.
Nice job! Good luck on your exams.
Every hard day that I didn't drink it got easier to stay sober.
I know my tomorrow self always thanks yesterday's self for not drinking. No matter how awful the situation alcohol does *nothing* to change or improve things.
