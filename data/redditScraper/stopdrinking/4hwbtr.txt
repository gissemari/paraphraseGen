I'm new here and awfully glad this resources is available.  My husband and I are both problem drinkers; we'd drink excessively together most nights of the week.  Both of us know we are addicted to alcohol and both want to get control over that addiction.  We've both tried to moderate for several years and both have failed.  I have made the decision to try abstinence.  He hasn't.  I texted him today from work to say I was struggling and his response was "moderation whatever I decide to consume."  He's trying to be supportive but what I need is "don't you fucking dare think about drinking!"  Anyone care to shout that at me?!

I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling. I found I needed to figure out what I needed from my wife and communicate it to her. Sounds simple but it took me some time to figure it out. Without me telling her she had no way of knowing. ..Best of luck to you.
Hello! I'm not going to tell you not to drink because it has to come from inside you. Relying on a spouse who abuses alcohol is not going to be productive and is not fair to him. I got support by getting a therapist and going to AA. Being with people who understand is encouraging and comforting. Thanks for your post and kudos for 37 days! I hope you find the support you need and deserve. 
I had to 100% separate my sobriety from my partner's. He still wanted to try moderating for another few weeks after I was both feet into AA. It was really helpful for me to have other sober alcoholics who were on the same page to support my efforts. My sponsor was absolutely a rock for me. ..Fortunately my partner is also sober just about 3 years. We all have our own journey.
I have used something I learned on here...playing the tape forward. I kept notes on my last binge and what it took/how I felt sobering up. Wasn't pretty.
