Started running the first time I quit drinking one of those couch to 5K programs and it really helped started up again after a relapse and did a 5K and just signed up for a 10K. I am not fast but have been consistent with the training and am amazed I can run for 45 minutes to an hour without stopping. Drinking I would never be able to do it. I also found it helps with urges I run right when I get home and by the time I get back and take a shower I am relaxed and feel pretty good.

Pretty much everyone.  Even Ambivalent_Fanatic is doing it.  Talk about your lowest common denominators.
Me too. Just got back from the gym- 4th time in 2 weeks ran only 3K again and thought I was going to drop dead at the 10 minute mark but it was great. Im still buzzing. Maybe next week I'll up it to 5K.. And yeah- drunk me would have not even considered signing up for the gym let alone going to one....Amazing how much changes.....

Not me. I started running (consistently) for about a year when I was still drinking. Stopped drinking during the last couple of months of training before my first marathon last fall but started drinking again **the week before** the marathon. Stupid or what? Ran a sub-4 hour race went out clubbing/drinking that night. Finally got things back on track in January. ..I am over 50.  Running is crucial to my sobriety but in my case it helped me **get to** sobriety. I had many a hung-over training run along the way. My way of kicking my own ass I guess. I never skipped a training run because of hangover. ..I can't underestimate how much confidence running a good marathon  (and running in general) gave me in the knowing that I could take on the long challenge of sobriety. ..I look at anyone out on a run -- such as people who are carrying extra weight or fighting for sobriety -- as heroes who are taking care of what they've been given. 
Along with going blind I am paranoid about messing up my knees. So I speed walk or bicycle. I am thinking about trying barefoot running seems like it would be less straining on the joints.

I'm actually in my car waiting for my GPS watch to sync up.  Like sunjim I was a runner before getting sober.  Running is a big part if my sanity and even a part of my spiritual practice.  No joke.
I started running about the same time I hit a long stretch of sobriety. Got up to ridiculous distances got really tan and lost a ton of weight. Women actually started asking me out! (I'm single so its ok)..Then got injured not from running and was not able to run at all for several months... the temptation for just one beer set in and it escalated to pretty heavy drinking a couple months later. I'm running again a bit heavier now but yes it certainly helps keep life in balance. ..I've come across a few very long distance runners who are alcoholics and use running as their balance. The conversation always leads to the question of switching one addiction for another. I don't really consider it that much I just like to run. ..
