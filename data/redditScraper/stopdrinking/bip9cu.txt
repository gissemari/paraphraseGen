This is the kind of stuff I said to myself to get through my days after I decided I wanted it to be easiest as possible not hard as possible:  Don't worry.  It's going to be OK.  Feel hope today even for a minute.  If it hurts today try to imagine it won't soon enough and the hope will bring the relief.  Then be present just focus on the task or scenery in front of me without judging it.  Get lost in the moment those are more peaceful sober moments that add up to the hours which add up to the days.  Because that will bring me the time I need to get further along and the further along I go the better I believe I will feel even if I'm struggling right this second.  I will get ideas that will help me out.  They will help make this as easy as possible because that's how I want this to go.  So I'll listen to the ideas and it will help.  This *is* getting easier every day.
