Ha.  Still me drinking until I couldn't stand up by myself staring at whatever was on TV not understanding it or remembering it wasn't much of a 'party'.
I read your title three times to the tune of Beastie Boys was that intentional?  Either way....I'm here not drinking with you and who says that can't be a party? ..Seriously though I know it is a struggle....  but as you'll hear others on here say and I agree: I never once woke up sober and wished I drank the night before. 
Gotta live some old school Beastie Boys!! It was definitely intentional lol. I am very happy that I woke up sober this am. IWNDWYT
