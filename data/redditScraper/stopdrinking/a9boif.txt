I have struggled daily with incredible cravings my brain tried to fool me hourly to have a drink for the last 19 days thankfully this time I didn't succumb and today was great the cravings subdued a lot and I was finally able to get through the day comfortably when I woke I immediately noticed my brain fog/headache was drastically reduced and I was hopeful that the day would be better it was..I'm lucky that I really don't want to drink anymore it's something I don't ever want or need in my life anymore so the only battle I have are the cravings. I'm really very hopeful that this is it. I'm done drinking
