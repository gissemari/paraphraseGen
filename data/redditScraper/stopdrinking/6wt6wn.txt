I made the decision to stop about a month ago. Did well for 3 weeks had a binge night last weekend that turned violent and into what it should not have and had about one malt beverage a night through last Thursday. My counselor has me on Vivitrol and Campral I'm due for my next shot of Vivitrol in a couple of days. Also on an anti-depressant and a sleeping med. Struggled with depression and anxiety since I was about 7. ..I just turned 34 and it seems that not drinking is more difficult for me than I thought it would be. Even on the anti-depressants my depression seems to be worse and hitting hard. Yesterday my brother asked me if I thought I was addicted to the alcohol or addicted to the feeling it gave me. I agreed with the latter. I determined a few weeks ago that alcohol has been my friend; it's always been there for me and makes me feel relaxed and happy instead of anxious and depressed. And now I don't have it and I am lost. It's scary. I've never had to deal with the real feelings before because I don't know how because I have always used alcohol to bury it. I know alcohol is a depressant but it rarely was for me. The reason I decided to stop is because my counselor believes that the alcohol is fueling my depression as I have been borderline suicidal and gone through crisis about 6 times since the end of June. We agree to disagree on that fact but I agreed to give him a year of sobriety so we can figure out what is really wrong. ..I do not really have a support system. Everyone I know drinks all my friends and neighbors gather in the home bar in the garage 2-3 nights of every weekend all my family is over an hour away I do not have any friends locally who do not drink. This past weekend I took off work and drove 90 miles to my old college roommate's place who is more supportive than any of my friends here and spent the weekend with her. I also took this Friday off but have no plans for other things to do. I also work second shift so that makes it difficult to be involved in anything. ..I'm just scared. I never had to deal with the real feelings and I do not know how to handle it. Yesterday at work I had coworkers asking what was wrong said I looked tired knew I was not right. I confided in one or two but I am not sure how much I trust them. I have a tentative appointment with my counselor on Thursday if that falls through (depending on if someone else shows up or not) I do not see him again until September 7th. I know they preach "one day at a time" but one day feels like a week... it's having to go one second at a time for me an hour feels like a day. I guess I don't know what I am looking for... I don't know what I am doing... I just know that the depression is much much worse since quitting drinking. Even one beer after work at night helped me relax and not be so depressed.

* Alcohol slows you down. Dulls you. It doesn't *really* relax or take away stress; it hides it and the things that caused it. Compare: "Drinking really helped me not feel my toothache and now that I don't drink it really hurts." Well...yes...because the source of the problem is still there...* Alcohol is a known depressor. A physical depressor. There's no scientific question about it. Depression + depressor = things get worse. You may not see it because you think "well I drank Monday and I felt OK"..thing is you don't make a long term connection with the long term drinking..* The depression *may* be compounded by drink withdrawal blues. But it's also possible that for the first time in a long time you actually *feel* what's going on...* If alcohol really would help at any level you wouldn't have the problems you have. Instead you have to be under the *constant* considerable influence of alcohol to *not feel* the problems you have. This is very different from therapy and/or medication...* It *is* scary. This whole "so what do people even *do* all the time" sober thing is scary. We weren't chucking The Duller because we were so good at being clear.  ..* I find the book "This Naked Mind" *tremendously* helpful. Much of what you say is addressed directly in it. You can buy it online or get a digital version for free from the sidebar (on the web; on mobile on the sub's front page hit the 3 dots at the top and select community information)
You're not alone.  I struggled by myself. I needed a new mode...I finally realized that it wasn't *lack of willpower* as my issue but rather *Lack of In Real Life Support*.  That's all I needed!..I went to meetings and immediately found people who understood what I was experiencing.  I got tools resources support and fellowship to first stop drinking and then to live sober...Now I just forgo ONE drink today - The First One..Never been happier!
