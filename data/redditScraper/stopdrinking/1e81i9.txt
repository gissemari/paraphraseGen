Well here I am 5 weeks into sobriety (on my second attempt) and it's been awesome. After my relapse I promised myself that I was going to actually **do the work** of AA and that started with a commitment to do 90-in-90. I did 43 meetings in the first 30 days.  ..The effects have been tremendous. I've lost weight and gained a new perspective on almost everything. My job was a little shaky but the increase in my level of performance has resolved that. I've had some troubles with my love life and they are sorting themselves out. And I was an isolated drinker now I am gradually developing a bit of a social life through the people I've met in AA.  ..It hasn't been easy and there are still issues I struggle with primarily related to ego but I'm aware of them and working on them. I am 100% committed to sobriety and I feel great about it.  ..Here's where I need your advice particularly you guys with a long time in. The Big Book and The 12 & 12 have proven to be excellent blueprints for growth but I'm beginning to feel that I have taken most of what I can from them. I'm looking for additional reading materials YouTube videos podcasts any additional materials that can help me remain inspired and dedicated to moving forward. Music is a big influence in my life and I am particularly interested in any recommendations for music that you find inspiring. Here's a couple of songs you guys might like:  ..[Frank Turner - Recovery](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjaxXNGu1QI)  ..[Blue October - Hate Me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDxgSvJINlU_)  ..[Holly Cole - I Can See Clearly Now](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_Iy3VoWJM). If I can recommend anything it's to listen to this song at the beginning of your day.  ..Okay I'll sign off this post with gratitude for your efforts in advance and a deep gratitude and affection for all of you here the ones that have helped me and the ones that I may have helped in some small way.

Kudos for so much progress in 34 days. As someone with a "long time in" I have a brief comment. Easy does it. Slow down. Work the steps with a sponsor. Write them out. Breathe. 
If you like I Can See Clearly Now you'll probably like [Echoes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2fsipYS_Xk).  Maybe there's a slowed down coffee shop version out there somewhere. 
Congratulations! I too like to totally immerse myself in research literature blogs whatever I can find. Here is a post from earlier listing a bunch of [sobriety-related blogs](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/137knw/what_are_some_of_your_favorite_recoverysobriety/). Also I know there are a bunch of sobriety-related podcasts; a few showed up in iTunes searches last time I checked. Good luck!
The twelve and twelve continues to be my guide.  I have been through the steps many times and still find applications in daily life.  .For what it's worth....I have as a hobby written some recovery books available online free - requires flash at [odatbooks](http://odatbooks.com)
