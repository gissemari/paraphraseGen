I've been to a few AA meetings now and have 8 days of sobriety. The only problem is that I am deeply and thoroughly ambivalent about AA. ..I'm still going to go at least in the short term. I just feel like it's the wrong program for me. ..It's really social. I'm really introverted and being around people - esp if I've been at work - is really stressful for me. ..People at the meetings I've been to seem to have absolutely zero boundaries and they are so pushy. I had a guy offer to drive me to a meeting in another town the first time I met him. ..I made a polite excuse but I was just thinking am i the problem? Is it normal to accept lifts from random strangers in the program?.. Another dude said I should go to meetings twice daily once a day at a minimum. In both cases my reluctance was taken as lack of commitment to staying sober. ..This is kind of what I'm thinking - if this is what the program requires I'm thinking it just really won't work for me?..And then I was thinking I have to keep going because otherwise they'll think I relapsed. Then I thought so what? It's a bit scary that I'm already in that mindset of worrying what the group thinks of me. ..I guess I'm just feeling very confused and a bit worried at the moment. Can any of you recommend alternative approaches? I've spoken to my doc about secular alternatives and he's given me a few numbers. ..I'm not bashing AA or any similar program - more wondering if AA might work better if you're a more social extroverted person?

I think you have appropriate questions and boundaries. I can also tell you are confused. Check out SMART Recovery. Also if you look at /r/alcoholism there are lots of links in the sidebar.
