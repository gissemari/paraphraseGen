I'm a little over four months sober. I did AA very briefly and have supplemented a lot with intensive therapy meditation running and a lot of reading. My husband has been supportive and understanding and even stopped drinking as well for a bit. He's a 1-2 beers a week person and does not have any problems with substance abuse...We've been very close and open during the last few months. We've had four weddings since my sobriety and they've all been triggering exhausting and hard. My husband left out of town last weekend after we attended a wedding together and I found myself suddenly on the brink of a relapse after finding a bottle of tequila in the back of our closet. I ended up calling my dad (6 years sober) to literally just come sit next to me until I was ok and got myself to a meeting and made it out alive thank god...This weekend two of my husbands high school friends who I've never met or heard of (we've been together ten years) are getting married about two hours away. I don't have it in me to go. These weddings have just been too hard for me. They're all so boozy and I just feel like a loser and I leave in a shame spiral. I told him I don't want to go and he was totally supportive and said he would just go alone which caught me by surprise. I asked if he would mind missing the wedding too because being home alone last time led to disaster. It led to a fight and neither of us can see the others side. I just need some help and advice right now. ..I need help. I feel like such a drain on him and in everyone around me. I feel pathetic for not wanting to be home alone but I still just don't feel safe with myself.

You're feelings are valid.  You don't want to be alone. His feelings are valid too.  He wants to be there for his friends.  Can you go visit your Dad during this time?  Have a friend stay with you?  Perhaps there is another solution.  Perhaps you could go travel to the place of the weddings but skip the actual event meet the friends the day before for brunch?  Maybe these aren't great ideas.  I bet you can come up with a solution.  Best wishes and super congrats on 4 months.  
Talk to him and say you are scared about relapsing when he's going away but also say that you feel bad for wanting him to stay home because of this. Maybe you could work out a plan for when he leaves maybe you could stay with your dad for those days? Or with someone else? Im sure he could help you find a comfortable solution if not though choices has to be made. Always put your sobrerity first it will get easier. ..My bf turned down a weekly job away because he was scared I was going to relapse before I had the chance to talk to him about it. My plan was to stay with my brother during that time which I think would have worked. But I did have a lot of thoughts on relapsing. Feel bad for my bf who decided to turn down the job.
