Hey everyone!..I went to my psychiatrist yesterday she fitted me in for a short appointment. She's not inclined to change my diagnosis until we determine whether this is an ongoing issue and also because I'm not presenting as any one thing. We added a medication and we're going to give that a trial run. If it helps I'm gonna stay on it for a couple of months and then taper off to see if it reset my brain chemistry. Man I *loved* screwing with my brain chemistry at the time I was doing it but this sorta sucks. Anyway it's at least a move in the right direction we'll see how it goes. ..I'm feeling more myself again anyway. I'm currently under a lot of stress from shitty situations at work my endless divorce and various other life things and my pdoc pointed out that I've had several other significant life stressors over the past few years so that's probably not helping anything. I do think that I fucked up my brain chemistry smoking all that weed during my last relapse though. ..So I went to a Marijuana Anonymous meeting last night. It was a mellow crowd. I talked to people afterwards and actually a girl I'm friends with through AA was there so it was a double bonus  cos I got to see her...The meeting that I chair tonight has a half hour overlap with a CMA (Crystal Meth Anonymous) meeting in the room next door and boy that's a boisterous bunch. No judgement it's just interesting how different fellowships have different vibes depending on the drug of choice...I liked the MA crowd. Like I said they were pretty chill. The twelve steps are the twelve steps that doesn't change but the literature they use is different and they seem to have a somewhat different take on things. ..I have an old friend who I haven't seen in several years and probably won't again (she's a friend of my ex and lives in another country) who was the first person I ever met who openly talked about being in AA. She loves AA and is active in the program but the last time that I saw her and we were talking about recovery she was saying how prefers NA (Narcotics Anonymous) meetings. She's active in both and identifies as both an alcoholic and an addict but she prefers the NA crowd. Alcohol is very much my drug of choice and I like AA but I can see now how she'd have a preference...One of the things that I liked a bunch about the MA meeting was that they have a short piece of literature that they read out loud at the start of every meeting called  The Dangers Of Cross-Addiction.  It basically says that this is an MA meeting MA is focused on marijuana use and there is no official stance on drinking or other substance use. However the experience of many many people in MA has been that even though they thought that they were able to drink or use other substances responsibly once they gave up smoking weed their other substance use got out of hand many of them eventually went back to their drug of choice and that continuing to use substances prevented them from really being able to recover...I appreciated that because that's how I ended up in that meeting in the first place. I only started smoking weed after a long period of abstinence from alcohol. I knew that I couldn't drink but I had never really been into weed at all so I thought that it would be fine. Once it was my only option however I started using it pretty much how I'd used alcohol with equally disastrous (but slightly different) consequences...Many people there were straight-up into MJ although a handful identified as both alcoholics and addicts. One of the guys at the meeting talked about how he'd been a sober alcoholic for 20 years before he started smoking weed again and that after several years it led him back to drinking. I'm sure that if I'd kept going I eventually would've gone back to drinking too...I enjoyed the meeting a lot and I want to get a copy of their book  Life With Hope' which is *waaay* cheaper through them than it is on Amazon so I'm sure that I'll go back. They gave me a little keychain a black plastic with the MA logo engraved in gold on one side and  Welcome' on the other. I love my recovery tchotchkes so I appreciate that. Otherwise life keeps trucking sobernauts. Gotta bolt some food down before I head out for my meeting. I hope you're all well. Peace and love!    ..Ginger_Sprout Out
