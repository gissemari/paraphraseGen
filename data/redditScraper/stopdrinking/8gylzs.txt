Hi Everyone..It's been a REALLY hard last week. I have the immune system disease called Multiple Sclerosis. Last Friday I could tell that I was in the middle of what is called a "flare-up." From last Friday until Wednesday I could not move my left leg or my left hand. I got placed on some handy-dandy steroids and I am getting much better now. But the days in between...I wanted to pop open our liquor cabinet open one of those bottles of Rum Gin Whiskey that are LITERALLY always here and drink to not feel the pain. My wife and I went out twice this week to get our of the house and deal with the harsh reality that she has never seen about my disease; and to also get the roid frustration out. In both of those nights it would have been SO easy to order that G&amp;T get that sweet delicious Margarita from our favorite bartender in the wold or to order a quick and cheap beer. ..I didn't. My wife has been coming around to the IWNDWYT which is so helpful. It has been a REALLY hard 7 days but I wanted to say that I made it. Now tomorrow is Cinco De Mayo and my sister-in-law's brewmaster boyfriend is bringing us some beer. I will resist with all I have. ..I want to say that the struggle is hard and that I do not have a lot of the same issues that a lot of you struggle with every day. I just wanted to share my story for the last few days...You all can do this. It is hard but look at the days next to people that have more days under their belt than you. They made it--you can make it too. Best of luck!.

Sounds like quite a frustrating week. Might not have been easy but the end result is you made it through without a drink just like the one before. So congrats on two weeks!..Let Cinco take care of Cinco... I will not drink with you today!
I have many chronic pain issues to deal with and yes I self medicated with vodka.  What I came to realize was that it really didn't take away the pain I still hurt but the damage it did to my relationships with others and myself was more damaging then the effects of my physical aliments. That is not even taking into effect the damage the alcohol was doing to my body and the risk of the medication I am taking mixing with the alcohol.  I give you props for not giving in! You can do this we both can.  As for the holiday well there's always a reason to drink holiday or not I tell myself to  get over it!  I will not drink with you today!
