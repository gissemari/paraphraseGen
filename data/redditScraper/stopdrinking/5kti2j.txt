I've been struggling with a moderate to severe problem for about three years now and as much as I hate the idea I think it's time to call it quits! Don't really wanna do AA don't have the time and don't really think I need it. Also I hear they talk about god alot alot. Wish me luck? Haha

Good luck!
"Luck chance and coincidence infer that your fate is in someone else's hands. .." I have read this recently and it really resonated with me. You're in charge of your sobriety. So keep fighting :).Coming on here is a great step there is a lot of support and helpful information.
Coming on SD is an awesome step. Everyone on here is amazingly encouraging and it's so cool to see how people root for and help one another. Helps to know that you're not going through it alone. Best of luck to you!
All the best!! Today is also my day 1 :) 
Wish you the best.  I have never been to AA but know it helps many.  Some folks might say that if someone has time for drinking then they could likely find some time for a meeting. It may take some time till you figure out what you need...I think most folks attribute something to their success if able to stay off the sauce for an extended time. For what is worth I am on SD a lot and read This Naked Mind.  I don't think I would be where I am without either of them.  Wishing you success.  After 30 years of heavy drinking I could not be happier with my decision to quit....

One thing to look forward to is the transition between hating the idea of getting sober to basking in the greatness of this idea. I started to feel that at about week 2. Good luck champ and I hope you check in often!
I can always moderate my drinking until the first one.  If AA is not your cup of tea try other secular sober groups (for example SMART recovery LifeRing SOS and others).  .Good luck and be strong!  We believe in you.
