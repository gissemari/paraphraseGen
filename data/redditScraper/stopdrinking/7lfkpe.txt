I had to share this realization. For years I've been in the habit of casually getting tanked at home alone. Or ending up drunker than my peers on a casual night. This usually would lead to a bit of a bender. I'm now in my late twenties and just got dumped by my girlfriend. I took it hard. We had been having a lot of issues and I dealt with those by drinking too...My immediate reaction was to get trashed for 9 days. I've been going to a therapist to deal with this relationship and my own personal issues for two months now and today I finally realized what I've always known   I have an alcohol   problem. I haven't been dealing with many emotional issues because I masked them with alcohol. Anger? Alcohol. Sadness? Alcohol. Fun? Alcohol. Loneliness? Alcohol. Boredom? Alcohol...I always thought that because I could quit and stop drinking after a couple drinks or a bender that I didn't have a dependency. While I'm not physically dependent I do rely on it emotionally in a way that is destructive and abusive to my friends and family. I act like an asshole far more casually and expect everyone to put up with it. I'm struggling with the shame from this. ..I make no promises that I won't ever drink again (I don't think I'm ready for that commitment yet) but it's time I really look at my behavior and make a whole hearted effort to change. I won't be drinking with you guys today or many days to come.

Sorry to hear about the gf.  Drinking can easy become a "solution" to many of my problems - because it works so well for them all!  It's a very reliable drug to take...It sounds like we went through some of the same stuff.  Not the easiest ride in the world and very eye opening.  Lots of stuff getting ignored for too many years.  Oops.
Good job on addressing your drinking issues! As far as sadness and depression go I find they they would just return once I sobered up; and as far as fun goes well I'd rather have a vivid experience of fun than a numb one of fun that I won't even remember the next day.
