I'm planning on moving into a sober living / half-way house in my town. This is the first time that I've been in any kind of residential recovery environment outside of a week-long detox a while back. I'm excited about this but understand what I'm getting myself into as much as I can...&amp;#x200B;..I like the place a lot and am revisiting the house with the manager tomorrow. I'd like to get as much of the information that I need to consider during our 1-on-1 so that I can make an informed decision. I also want to make sure I really understand how the house operates so that there's not a bunch of surprises after I move in...&amp;#x200B;..Any thoughts about questions that you think I should be sure to ask? I know some of you have been in spaces like this before and probably have lots of experience. I welcome input from anyone though. ..&amp;#x200B;..Thanks!..&amp;#x200B;..More info if you're interested: ..It's a single home with a handful of LGBTQ-friendly people. The manager is social worker who is there regularly from day to day and a licensed therapist works 1-on-1 with residents too. There are some shared meals outings and activities. It's surprisingly affordable. Expectations include recovery meeting attendance drug screening working a program etc. ..Personally I'm already in IOP and have been working the 12-steps with a good sponsor. But I'm really struggling with getting much more than a month behind without relapsing. I've spent a long time trying to solve this on my own and have finally really accepted that I can't do this on my own. ..I'm in my early 40's single without kids and work from home. I'm very open-minded and love living in community-oriented spaces.

I think you sound like you are doing really well. I am not sure what else you can do / ask. Maybe how do they sort out conflict / differences between the residents. I think that's important. And if anyone else has interesting hobbies. That's what I would be interested in : how to handle the good times and the bad
Don't be afraid to ask the people who live there what they think. They know it better than anyone.
