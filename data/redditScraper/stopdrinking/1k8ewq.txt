Requested a reset for my badge and posting so I have no way to excuse or explain this to myself tomorrow.

Congrats for getting back on track.  So what's the plan this time around?  
Hang in there. 
Don't refer to it as your first relapse. That suggests there might be a second one. Don't set yourself up for failure by leaving that window open.
Get back on the horse and start again.  Good Luck.
Well that is one way that didn't work. How will it be different this time?.
