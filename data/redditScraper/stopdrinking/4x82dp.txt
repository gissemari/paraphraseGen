**TL;DR** I've been struggling with general apathy and malaise for the last few weeks but if I've learned anything since getting my first badge in March 2015 it is that how I *feel* is much less important than *what I do*...**Back story**..My life was closing in on 5 years of uncertainty last March when I decided that my reliance on alcohol had to stop. I visited the sub frequently those first few weeks but as my life finally settled I stopped reading/commenting. After moving for my dream job last summer and getting our family settled in our tenure (read: ten year; I'm a uni prof this has been a long running family joke) home I felt the weight of the world had lifted. Life was good. I thought "Hey I didn't have a drinking problem I had a problem coping with the stress of life. Now that life is settled I can drink again." That was in October. By January it was clear that I have a problem with alcohol...**The present**..Stopping this time has been a mixed-bag. I do not have all of the chaos excitement and fun of selling/buying a house moving states and starting something new to distract me from my thoughts/desires to drink. I'm learning that I am terrible at doing nothing; relaxing is a completely foreign activity. For that matter life with out the extremes of alcohol and day-to-day uncertainty is completely new territory. ..As I explore this new land of sobriety and life stability (in as much as life ever really stable) I am going to keep my wits about me and trust that each step each day will bring me closer to true appreciation for the life I have and those wonderful people in who make the journey all the better. I will also continue to visit this sub so that I don't make the mistake again of thinking that I can moderate my alcohol intake...**Gratitude**..I am thankful for all of you at /r/stopdrinking. In the last 90 days sobriety has allowed me to..- support my kid through an ER visit 24-hr hospitalization (the food was not terrible) and help her navigate new medication (she has epilepsy).- be there for my kids to celebrate their triumphs and provide consolation during their struggles .- make meaningful progress at my job (supporting students submitting research for publication).- take daily action towards better physical health (diet running and strength training).- make good financial decisions for our family.- be a member of this community..The list of good choices and good moments is actually much longer. Thank you for embracing me as a member of this community. I share this in part to remind myself that even if I don't *feel* good right now my life is measurably better now that I'm not drinking. A drunk might give me a few hours of chemical euphoria but that is not worth the consequences of withdrawal and shame. Eventually my feelings will catch-up  with my actions and I want to be sober to appreciate the return of joy and deep appreciation for this one life I've been given.

Great post /u/curiousquant -- keep doing what you're doing my friend.  There's life out there!
&gt;how I feel is much less important than what I do..I am working on this as well and find it just as important.  As CC says "act your way into better thinking".  ..Congratulations on 90 days and thanks for being a part of this journey with me.
Congrats on 90 days! It looks like you have learned a lot and are taking it all in even the down days. We all have those days and they do eventually pass. My attitude changes just from morning to night. I am much more irritable at night and have to be conscious of that. I work at a college too with students who are about the same age as my kids. Rewarding most of the time exhausting other times. I have found I am dealing with all of life much better these days though! ..Happy for you!!
Way 2 go!!! Happy for you as well. I will not drink with you today!
Nice one. After commenting on me I went in search of you. Together we struggle together journey - together we stay sober.
