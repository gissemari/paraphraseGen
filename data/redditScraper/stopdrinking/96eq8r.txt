Tell it to f*ck off.  
[This](https://i.imgur.com/5g7B6bd.jpg) is how I feel about moderation.
Kick that demon voice on your shoulder into touch.  You are more powerful than that voice!  That craving that you have for me of an evening can be beaten and the feeling when you wake up sober and realise it was the best decision you made last night to remain sober.  You can do this best of luck and IWNDWYT!
 Shut the fuck up you pathetic piece of shit that wants to drag me down. I'm better than you

Sometimes....'awh ok then' but i am working on it ! 
I say "Die little voice!  You will die of thirst!"
A very firm "No!"  Then walk away from it and do something else. 
The mind has a mind of its own. When that voice or vision pops up I'm like."Oi you bugger off I'll do the thinking round here" Then I play the tape forward think of something else direct my mind elsewhere and not caught up in that fatal fantasy. 
"we've tried that doesn't work."
I firmly remind that voice that  we have tried it your way. This time we are sticking to my plan. Thank you for your input however the decision has already been made that we aren't drinking today . ..Sometimes my drinking brain just has to have a temper tantrum and be upset that everything is unfair. That's alright. It's all part of the journey. I can feel sad upset whatever comes to the surface. However those feelings do not change the underlying decision that we aren't drinking today...IWNDWYT 
It's just not worth the risk.  I'd much rather live to my potential these days.  If we hang in there for more time and appreciate - I mean *really* appreciate - every facet of our new experience without drinking being involved give it a fair chance we can see how much better our lives truly are getting on without it.  I won't go back.  That voice is a liar.  **iwndwyt**
I picture the last time I drank and what happened afterwards - Me huddled pathetically over a toilet bowl at 6:00am in a cold dingy apartment somewhere in China intermittently gagging and throwing up. I remember the smell of it - it smelled of stale cheap red wine. And the color was bright red - like blood. I remember taking ibuprofen (which did nothing to help) brushing my teeth gargling with mouthwash and then having to get on a bus full of people to go to work for 12 hours at a job I hated. I tell myself "Do you really want to go back to that?"
Ah the Lizard brain...   Tell it to shut the fuck up that ain't you anymore.
