I've tried a couple times this year already to cut down/quit. After a brief 7 then another 3 days sober I went all out for 2 weeks. Sunday was day one again when I asked my girlfriend if she thought I had a problem. She said she knew I was struggling and that I was addicted. I think hearing that out loud really hit me hard and makes me want to overcome this again. So Sunday night I went to an AA meeting for the first time. Not sure how I feel about it yet but everyone there seems supportive which is nice. Picked up This Naked Mind yesterday and I'm planning on going to another meeting tomorrow. Here we go for real this time I think. IWNDWYT

Good luck. AA saved my life. Don't be afraid to try different meetings. Each group develops its own personality. 
Glad you are here and thank for sharing! "Hearing it out loud" can be so huge - but so many people hear it out loud and then uh... ignore it or fight against it. Props to you for hearing the call and taking action...Naked Mind is great - reading through it myself!..It's a privilege to be on this journey with you - IWNDWYT!!
Any proactive action in support of getting and maintaining sobriety is a huge step in a good direction .All my best!  I will be very happy not drinking with you today    
The first step you can take (and I don't mean of 12 just generally) is to admit to yourself that you have a problem. Kudos to you for hearing it from someone else and internalizing it I know I just made excuses when I heard it from others.
