*For the record this has nothing to do with actual war "war stories" is just what we called our bad experiences in rehab. This is also going to be very long so please bear with me...This story is mainly a warning for any lurkers who may be out there who are still in the throes of addiction and still looking for motivation to get sober as well as a warning for anyone currently sober who may be developing a case of the fuck its and is thinking of picking up again and to those who may have already picked up again...I have been toying with sobriety for the last 2 years now getting sober for a time and then drinking again...repeatedly. I had 6 months at the longest then one month then a few weeks then 3 months then 1.5-2 months--its been a back and forth song and dance for too long. NO MORE after this experience...As the majority of us know every time you come off of alcohol the withdrawal gets worse. I guess I thought the people who told me that before were full of shit or something because I kept playing with fire. And then a few weeks ago I had an experience so unholy that I'm afraid to even LOOK at a vessel of alcohol ever again much less put it in my mouth...About 2 months ago I started having a really difficult time dealing with my mental illness. Then my fiance and I broke up (we're working things out now thankfully)...then I got evicted...then I lost my job...then I realized I had to move back in with my mom...which means I'm also losing my cat temporarily as my mom and stepdad apparently hate animals. So I started drinking again. I got wasted every day for about a month straight until one day I was like "What the hell am I doing? Enough is enough"...Thus started the withdrawal process as soon as the booze had made its way out of my system. Now I've been in withdrawal plenty of times before and I never really had it all that bad. I had also heard of Delirium Tremens but I had never really experienced that before so I figured I'd be okay and just feel sick for a few days...WRONG. So so wrong. I should have gone to the hospital but once I really got into it I knew they would just put me in a coma temporarily until it was over and I wanted to be awake and fully aware and suffer so I would learn my lesson once and for all. That was probably very stupid of me but I mean...my method worked...I could not eat for two weeks; any attempt at doing so even just for the sake of my blood sugar was immediately rejected by my stomach. Awful nausea for a solid week. Every muscle in my body was cramping at some point or another and it wasn't a slight cramp it felt like full blown Charlie horses all over my body. I could barely walk because I was shaking so hard so I couldn't shower for a good 8-9 days. Forget about using my hands they were out of commission. I couldn't regulate my body temperature. I was either overheated and sweating like crazy or I was bundled up in two pairs of pants a sweatshirt a robe and four blankets and STILL shivering; there was no in between...And that was just the easy part...I could not sleep properly for a good two weeks. Any attempt at sleep ended in my having severe nightmares waking up while convulsing or the best one waking up suddenly because I had stopped breathing. It took all my energy to prop myself upright comfortably but I had to because every time I tried to lay flat I would start to fall unconscious and stop breathing. When that happened and I would wake up (to this day don't know what woke me up) the first thing I would do was naturally take in the biggest gulp of air I could manage. But it was in vain and not satisfying...because my lungs were starting to fail. And that's not all: I was trying to force myself to guzzle water and keep it down so I would at least be hydrated and yet I could barely pee for days--it was a real struggle to feel like I had to go let alone get anything out...because my kidneys were starting to shut down too...The dizziness and confusion really got to me. I didn't know my face from my rear for a good 8 days and I was seeing and hearing a lot of stuff. I suffer from bipolar with psychosis and I'm no stranger to hallucinations but I have never had them on this level. I could see and feel bugs crawling on me; I heard my family calling for me; I was seeing all sorts of bright moving flashing lights which would have been a great free personal light show if I didn't have a headache delivered directly from Satan himself. ..Then once all of that is over and you start to feel vaguely like a human being again along comes stage two: violent gastrointestinal distress on the other end. Which clearly isn't as bad as stage one but still sucks and you better pray you don't have to make any long drives during those few days...I can think of very few things I've lived through that were more horrifying than laying in bed barely able to move or breathe begging God not to take me yet because I genuinely thought I was gonna die and I'm just not ready yet. I'm sure He laughed at me because I told him it wasn't my time yet and that's y'know kinda up to Him not me. But dammit I was not ready to go and the time I didn't spend with my head in a trash can I spent pleading for my life. I really fail to understand how I managed to make it out of those scary-ass proverbial woods without any medical intervention or calling an ambulance though I dialed 911 a few times but chose not to hit the call button. But here I am breathing peeing and sleeping again and eating literally anything I can get my hands on xD..As assholeish as this is gonna sound I hope my story scared someone out there enough to put the bottle down once and for all because the experience scared the shit out of me enough to do so. My grandfather was a recovered alcoholic for something like 15 years and I swear on his grave I will never touch another drop...I realize this was incredibly long and I apologize for that as well as thank anyone who stuck with me from beginning to end. I just really needed to get it off my chest and I really hope my experience can help at least one other person join me in saying "Enough is enough. No more."

Came here off of the /r/askreddit security camera thread. Read through the whole thing and damn man much respect right there...&amp;#x200B;..I like the taste of beer but have only ever really drank non-alcoholic beer as to not let it mess with my medication.
