 ..*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*..**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**..I'm pledging myself to not drinking today no matter what happens good or bad and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others...It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours let's not drink alcohol!..**This pledge is a statement of intent.**..Today we don't set out trying not to drink we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!..What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) we're not ready to give up...**What this is:**..A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning...**What this isn't:**..A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread...This post goes up at:..US Night/Early Morning..Europe Morning..Asia and Australia Evening/Night..A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar...\--------------------------------------------------------------------..Happy International Workers' Day! Is it a holiday where you live? ..To me it's a day to reflect about the power of collective action and support. That's what I get from r/sd and my offline AA meetings. Very often we don't share much else apart from a shared struggle with drinking and a desire to stop using this harmful substance. Reading all the check-ins is inspiring and bracing to me - so know that you're helping somebody else by checking in. :) ..Today's quote is from a guide on how to practice meditation but it applies equally to me with sobriety. My sobriety is my practice or is one of my practices and the sobriety muscle is growing stronger - it's easier to just let go and do it. ..&gt; Seeing our practice as our life we just let go and do it. We just practice a steadiness in our daily meditation. Without expectations of any kind we just practice day in and day out through the high points  and the low. ..I will not drink with you today no matter what happens.

IWNDWYT
It's a national holiday here in Finland and what a great day to not drink. IWNDWYT!
Thank you to TCSongs for our check in and all who post weather in support of others reaching out for help or perhaps just saying you will be sober...Power of collective help. How powerfully it can be. I think of any group with a common purpose like a box of matches. Take 1 and it can be broken. Two and break them a little harder. Three a little harder again. 10 very hard. Take the whole box. I don't think it would be humanly possible to break them all at once...Put 2 or 3 alcoholics together they may drink. 10 most likely not. 50 everyone is safe. ..I some times look at a post and add up the total sober days. It can be amazing. There can be a lot of collective wisdom and expiriance and importantly a lot of strength...So if we all come together and remain focused on not drinking. Working on ourselves and helping each other we will be safe. Or at least much safer than being alone...Together we can move foward with strength and security. My purpose is to check in and show my hand held out to all. This will help maintain unity perhaps help another. But beyond this it will put a little insurance on my sobriety. I like to have that insurance...So I am pledging just for today to be sober with you. ..Your Friend John.          
No booze just blue skies and sunshine today   
I've been going through the worst withdrawals I personally have had. I am scared of kindling and I've seen that my withdrawals will keep getting worse after each relapse. My father had DTs by my age. I have had similar heavy drinking episodes. Sunday was my last heavy drinking day on monday I had a sixpack to calm the shakes and on tuesday 3 small beers. Getting close to 24 hours sober now and it's another try with kicking alcohol out of my life once and for all. I'm so tired to live like this. I pray to God this time I would succeed...IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT. Have a great day/evening all.
Very cool lecture at uni today met my urgent work deadlines also and there's rain about. Kiddo home from school for tonight and all is well with the world. No booze today none tonight and I won't be drinking with y'all tomorrow either.
Morning from the UK!..No we don't have a holiday for international workers day today- could do with one though- workload looks frightful today!..Pinch punch first of the month! Have a great day sobernauts!..I will not drink with you today

Nope. Not on labour day....Staying sober.
Not drinking today. Exercising taking my supplements reading working on the business. Starting to feel good.
IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT. Been to the gym this morning feeling positive.
Managed a long haul plane flight and a dinner with a colleague last night. ..IWNDWYT
Ok wow my first post. I commit for today. Scared
Totally didn't realize it was the start of a new month! Looking forward to a sober May. My one month is on Cinco de Mayo go figure! IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you today
Happy May Day! ..I'm hoping y'alls is better than my last day of April and my first day of May. Molar cracked. Nerve exposed. Pain OMG! About to drive an hour in heavy rush traffic to be an oral surgeon's first patient today *May Day* when I should instead be dancing around the May Pole with my dear Knitwit and bbq-ing something tasty. It'll be gruel for me I'm afraid. Last night all I could manage was a bowl of soft noodles...Luckily though I'm sober and not hungover and so can deal with life's ups and downs in a responsible manner to the best of my ability.
**IWNDWYT!!!**
I will not drink with you today!

Good morning everyone. No poison for me today. IWND  WYT.
Edging ever so close to two weeks and I'm pretty darn proud of myself. IWNDWYT.
I just looked at my counter and I'm at 118 days. Yay! Not drinking today to celebrate. Have a great Wednesday everyone.
Morning! First sober birthday in 20 years. Thinking it could be the best present I've ever given myself...And y'all are the icing on the cake :) I will not drink with you today friends &lt;3
Back to day one allowing myself free reign on carbs to get through the cravings. Once I'm through the first week it gets easier. IWNDWYT
No drinking with you today

IWNDWYT
Had a dream that I drank wine. Then was disappointed that I broke my streak. But it was only a dream   IWNDWYT
I'm not going to drink alcohol today
I will not drink with you today.
Good morning friends! Today I am helping my son with his final year dissertation (about leitmotif and branding). Small things like this really hammer home how r/stopdrinking has changed my life...In the past I'd have struggled to help him. I'd be fighting a hangover. I'd be grumbling. I'd have one thing on my mind (and it wouldn't be the dissertation). In the present everything's changed...I am so happy to be here for him. This is a small but simple pleasure...It is joy in a simple act...I'm bracing myself for a day manning my phone as my son calls me on what he's termed the  Dissertation Crisis Helpline'. I'm looking forward to being that Dad I always wanted to be. No going back...Friends as per usual: I will not drink with you today. Stay strong everyone... 
I will not drink today.
I couldn't do it yesterday. I feel really ashamed and frustrated with myself I didn't need to drink at all but I kept justifying it until I caved. If anyone can offer some words of advice or support it would be greatly appreciated. I'm not going to drink today.
Day 90 and all is well. Saw the doc yesterday and he was impressed with the improvement in my mood and temperament. As well as doing lots of outdoor stuff I now also keep bees. Did a few courses etc over the last couple of years and now the time is right so heading up there now to fence in the area and check on how they are doing since I got them 3 days ago. Stay strong. IWNDWYT.
Feel like I will crave today. Ive been working like Ive got superpowers. But I will not drink today. Might eat candy ;)
 Day 5 in Troy NY no hangover!
I am staying sober with everyone today!  Make it a good one.
IWNDWYT!!
IWNDWYT
I will not drink today.
IWNDWYT
I will not drink today.   Especially won't get suckered in by the liquor store as I drive past it...&amp;#x200B;..Yesterday felt like suck today feels better I think I'll stick with better.
I will not be drinking today
Not today. Not today. Not today!!!!
I will not drink today!
I will not drink with all of you today.
Holy shit. Just thought to check in here today. It's been 93 days since my last drink?!?! ..Holy Shit! In the past 18 years the longest I went was 30 days. Once. ...Used to drink 10 drinks a day everyday for atleast 10 years. Now I'm getting up at 5:45 everyday so I can chill by myself in the living room and have a cup of coffee before the rest of this crazy family wakes up. ..93 days ago I was at the lowest point of my drinking life. For sure. Today I am proud of who I am. Of the father I am. Today I will not drink.
Three weeks! IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT.

Good morning! It is not a holiday here in the US. I am looking forward to Memorial Day late in May. That'll be the first holiday we've had that is recognized by my work since New Year's. And I am tired. I went to bed at 8:30 last night and was drifting off around 9 when drunk BF came in and put his cold feet on me and otherwise woke my right up. GGGGRRRRR. Then I had drinking dreams all night. Am a bit grumpy on this May Day! But won't drink with you.
I drank last night. Was awful to people I love. Texted my ex in a most embarrassing fashion. I kind of want to crawl in a hole today. Over a month free In  the trash.  But IWNDWYT.
I will not drink with you today!
IWNDWYT!
Just not going to drink today. Simple. Instead I have done some tasty home cooking for my boys and going to plan some exercise challenges over the next few months. .THIS IS HOW TO LIVE .big love SD

Work is a zoo but I won't be an angry chimp by boozing
Hi All..Im sneaking off work this afternoon to go to a baseball game.  This is definitely a trigger for me but Im NOT going to drink any stinking    today!
Hello all! Had a strange wobble last week a few things rattled me that I didn't quite understand and I think maybe related to my upcoming one year anniversary and my sleep and waking routine went to absolute shit...However! I kept plugging away not drinking not doing drugs exercising journaling etc etc. The good habits I've picked up this last year have helped me stay on the right path more than once and one of those good habits is popping on here to read and post every few days!..IWNDWYT!
I laughed while out for a walk yesterday because the coffee shop I frequent is right next door to the neighborhood bar. Crossing the street felt like having the angel on one shoulder and the devil on the other in a way that was so heavy-handed and obvious that it made me giggle. I went in the coffee shop. Not drinking today folks!
Not today.
2 weeks today. A modest achievement but I'm proud of myself
Not drinking today  
Good morning SD!..I'm not drinking today!  ..Stay strong!
Howdy friends! ..IWNDWYT  
Day 31. I have one month under my belt and I have earned that 1 in my star. :) I will be collecting my 30 day chip tonight. My next mini-goal is 5 weeks (35 days) so I will not drink today.
4:45 AM alarm. Shoes on. Out the door. 3.5 mile run to kick off a six week mileage build with nothing but easy miles. ..IWNDWYT ..https://www.instagram.com/p/BwaVZTdAUc4/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=p1l5nm3vmnlo

I will not drink with you today.
Lots of things to celebrate today! May Day hump day...but sobriety is always tops!! Happy sober hump May Day!    
I will not drink today.
I will not drink today.
IWNDWYT!!!
Two days down starting day three for me here. Thanks so much for all of your inspiration. No matter how bad today gets I will not drink with you today.
IWNDWYT!
No drinking today or the next 24 hrs.
Good morning from California!  Early morning here and I'm enjoying my coffee and scrolling SD.  89 days.  Inching right along.  Good people of SD IWNDWYT    Gigi
Another day sober
I will not drink with you today!

I will not drink today!!!
Back on day 2. IWNDWYT.
I will not drink today.
Checking in still here still sober still living and enjoying life. An amazing journey bring awake and kind if happy. .Peace. .IWNDWYT
Day 3! 2 nights in a row I've actually slept like a baby I hope that sticks this time around. Last night I was craving pretty bad but shook it off somehow.  I am NOT going to drink tonight!
Thanks for this quote Threechordsongs. I've always believed my meditation isn't limited to a defined time and space but rather a purposeful state of mind throughout my day. And today IWNDWY. Enjoy the holiday! (I'm in the U.S.--no holiday here.)
New month and I'm starting it sober. IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you today. Have a great day everyone! ;)
Another day sober .And already feeling better/healthier .I will not drink with you today!!
iwndwyt
Day 5. I will not drink today :)
Need to get back into checking in every day. Lots of temptation out there. Glad to have you all for support. IWNDWYT
Okay. Day 1 came and went and the world didn't collapse in on me. Just some anxiety and mild tremors. Getting even this much distance and having a place to type things out makes it easier to see that alcohol doesn't help my problems get better it just helps me hide from them. ..On to Day 2. IWNDWYT
The world is a far better place for me to stroll through sober. Therefore I will not drink with you today. 
I will not drink today!
Day 4.  One more day until much needed meeting.
Yesterday was a success! Not feeling great this morning and I'll likely want to drink tonight but I can't think of a good reason to. One more day.
45 is halfway to 90 days which is halfway to 180 I hope I'll be able to enjoy both and keep going and definitely I will not drink with you today!
Day one.
Good morning SD I will not drink with you today!
I don't believe in god but sometimes I address my serenity "prayer" to "goddess" which for me refers to the best part of myself. Basically I need my inner wisdom or the part of me that is stable and resilient to help the part of me that is anxious and fearful to get through another day with all the challenges it brings. I call that part of myself out explicitly which can be helpful...I will not drink with you today.
Iwndwyt   
IWND  WYT.
'The sobriety muscle is growing stronger' - yes that is exactly how it feels!  On day 25 and I will not drink with you today.
No drinking today !
Day 6 and I feel Amazing! Good luck everyone you have my love and support!
Ugh every time I walk into work I'm filled with dread of the day ahead. I want to just breathe and realize nothing is gonna happen that will make me think I need a drink. IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you today.
It's my birthday and for the first time in 24+ years (or something) I won't drink on this May 1. No matter what happens.
Meditation is something I have picked up as part of my recovery so I really like the quote today. Good morning from the west coast SD I will not drink with you today.
Day 314 no mood or mind altering substances. Life isn't perfect but it's worth living.
Checking in. IWNDWYT
A whole new shiny fresh month! May is pretty one where I live; I'm planning to enjoy it without fuzz-brain! IWNDWYT
37 hours!! Or on day 2! Small steps is where it starts!!..IWNDWYT
Good morning! I'm almost at 2 months. Graduated from my intensive outpatient program and am proud and excited but nervous for  normal' life after rehab. I have a plan and great support including you all so I can make it through. ..IWNDWYT
Day 9 and it will be another dry day
Good morning world!..IWNDWYT
Love the quote today u/threechordsongs! Thanks IWNDWYT
Today I will experience whatever comes my way without the knee jerk reaction of instant solutions or fixes. I am patient and I will not drink today!
IWNDWYT!
IWNDWYT!!!
I will not drink today
Not drinking with you all today!  Enjoy your day!!  &lt;3
IWNDWYT!
Here in the US I'm afraid we're way too individualistic and wed to capitalism to acknowledge May 1 as anything just another spring day!..Thanks for the meditation quote. I started practicing meditation about four months ago and it definitely helped kick start my sobriety. I keep discovering connections between the two and marveling at how one supports the other in a kind of symbiotic relationship. ..Looking forward to another day of relative clarity and hope here on Day 7. IWNDW Y'all T!
Having a friend over to help us clean out our storage unit/prep for our upcoming camping trip. I will be sober the entire time. IWNDWYT!
I love this community!  IWNDWYT
Day 1 but motivated. I think I'll manage it today. Depression is strong and I know the only way out is to not drink today!
Had a weird relapse dream last night. More on guard than ever not to let it happen. IWNDWYT
I will not drink today.
Checking in!
Day9! IWNDWYT
Day 213 of not drinking. IWNDWYT
/u/threechordsongs despite only sharing a struggle and a desire I have been surprised at how much I feel the fellowship with virtually everyone here on SD and at my meetings.  I'm so grateful for that!..Off to go do whatever it is I'm supposed to do ;-)..IWNDWYT
Yesterday was a bit of a mental struggle after work. However I did not drink. I will not drink again today.
I will not drink today!
Checking in for day two. Back at work so my triggers are going to be tested but with you guys help I've got this.
Checking in not today
IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you today.  I'm already have thoughts of "how am I going to NOT drink this weekend and say no to temptation".  UGH.
Good morning.  I will not drink any alcohol today.  Nope!
Today begins month four. I need to make it a great month. IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT
Nice quote! I will stay in the present today and continue my practice...IWNDWYT

I'm not seeing my number but I'm at 21--three whole weeks. I will not drink with you today.
I pledge to stay sober another 24 hours here in New England with all of you amazing people!! Stay strong everyone!!
I've had enough of it.  I'm wasting my health and my life with drinking.  There is just no good from it.  I need to find healthier ways to deal with my stress and angst.  Today I am taking that first step and committing not to drink at least for today.
IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you today. Another stellar day in Colorado.
Work up today feeling kinda bad almost like I'd been up late drinking.  Not sure why I think I might be a little dehydrated and coming down with something.  Unlike if I'd been drinking I recovered pretty quickly after my morning coffee and a shower.  All in all a good reminder of why I'm doing this as I start my 5th month of sobriety...I won't be drinking today no matter what.
I will not drink with you today
Just hit 8 months sober! I'd like to say I'm on cloud 9 but I should probably save that for 9 months sober ;) It's been a busy week packing up to head to Italy on Saturday! I've never been to Europe before so it's a big trip for me. I'm sure that there will be plenty of temptation when we're over there but I have my sobriety tools in my back pocket and even learned how to say "I don't drink" in Italian (sono astemia)! I'll be toasting all you awesome SD-ers in a few days with some delicious Italian coffee but certainly not with alcohol!
for the fifth and hopefully last first time (in two weeks) IWNDWYT.
Day 45! This is how far I got last time. Intend to get to day 46 (and beyond) this time. IWNDWYT!
IWNDWYT.
I will not drink with you today.

Still sober and gonna stay that way.  ..Iwndwyt
I'm in.
I will not drink today  !
Damn back to Day 1 again. I convinced myself I'd quit later - in a few months. Nonsense! I'm quit now. And so I will jot drink with you today. I will however do a lot of reading here today. Thank you for the support brothers and sisters.
Day 2. IWNDWYT.
I don't want to drink but I want to be drunk. Fuck everything but I'm not gonna drink.  IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT!
Someone said that they can tell I'm healthier especially around the eyes. I love sleeping. I mean ACTUALLY sleeping finally. And waking up not wanting to die with the daily scaries. IWNDWYT.
I will not drink today.
I will stay sober today.
Afternoon SD IWNDWYT

First of the month the beginnings of a new and changed life.  IWNDWYT
Court date tomorrow. Very minor violation so nothing bad can come of it but can at least go in saying I've been sober since the incident...Not drinking with any of you today!
I won't drink today.
Day 92 IWNDWYT
Another day another commitment to not drink. Thank you all.
Have the day off work and waiting an hour at the auto shop to get my tires changed. Next door happens to have a pizza place with lunch special of a free slice with each draft beer. Off work on a nice spring day and the beer is calling. But I played the tape forward and am sitting here drinking coffee instead of going next door. Funny mind trick is I told myself I should go next door just to watch the Barr hearings on TV. Silly me. I can catch up on Twitter here. No need to go near the beer to keep up on the news. Silly brain tricks. I will not drink with you today!
Sober like a fox!
I've become less diligent about the daily check in thread the past week or so. Getting back to it as I find it tremendously useful for my own accountability...IWNDWYT.  
I will not drink today!!     
I will not drink with you today.

IWNDWYT! Day eighth!
IWNDWYT
I stopped on Monday I'm loving hangover free mornings and productive days I jest wish I could sleep a bit better!!!!..On the sparkly water instead of Malbec...IWNDWYT
Not drinking today!
Day 500! IWNDWYT!
Today it feels like a real one but I will not drink with you today!
Had a little bump in the road over the weekend. Back and I'm committed!  IWNDWYT!
I will not drink today.
Day three lets go I will not drink today!
Trying to push myself into not thinking about alcohol. ..skipping check in...ain't working. .spend more time trying not to think about it then I spent checking in every day and participating. ..so..I will not be drinking with you today and I will never drink again and I will never change my mind. .
Guess it's been... 8 months? I didn't record the exact date because I was pretty sure I'd try and use it as a "oh I've made it X00 days maybe I can try one" excuse. But haloweeen wad the first big company party I didn't drink at so that's my rough benchmark. ..Can't believe I made it. Meds have helped tremendously but sometimes I'll use weed in a similar way to how I used to use booze. It feels like cheating but now I've got some accountability and perspective on why and I can catch myself in the moment. Plus no hangovers is a plus.
IWNDWYT   
I will not drink with all of you today!
not drinking today
IWNDWYT!  
Day at the park planned with my daughters and their friends then home for my wife's birthday party. It's gonna be a long one but a good one and more importantly an alcohol-free one! IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you today.
I am sober for almost 24 hours now. I know it's not much but it's the absolute longest I've gone in such a long time. IWNDWYT!
Not drinking today because it is totally not worth the anxiety and depression the next day!
I haven't and won't drink with you today! :)

Posting from bed. My lovely wife is already sleeping peacefully beside me. My happy daughters were out cold a long time ago worn out from soccer practice. And I'm fighting our boxer and two cats for my share of the blankets...I made it through another day. Just barely at times but I made it nonetheless.
Not drinkin today. Almost 60 days not drunk
I did not drink on Wed but it was a holiday in Portugal!
