The last time I drank I ended up having a complete meltdown because it was my third relapse in 2016. I first put a month together after a trip to the ER for an alcohol-induced panic attack. Then I tried moderation and I failed. Then I put together two months right after that and thought I had this under control. I tried moderation again and failed. After this relapse I decided to seek out an anti-depressant because I used to be on one and life was okay back then. I certainly wasn't drinking like this. ..Fast forward to 3.5 months dry and it's December. I'm on my medication and I'm feeling just like my old self. I tricked myself into thinking maybe I was just depressed and that's why I was drinking like an alcoholic. I ended up unraveling faster than ever before after that first drink. I ended up taking a leave of absence from my job for a week because I was in such bad shape. I was begging my family to put me in rehab while I had insurance. My mom and brother ended up taking me back to the same ER I went to earlier in the year. Haha I was assigned the same room I had before and the same Social Worker. I was so embarrassed but he was very understanding that something wasn't working obviously. This guy (me) is 29 and should know better. ..So I ended up spending the weekend in a Psychiatric hospital to get my strength back and just take a break from life. I got out on a Sunday and went to work the next day. This was a week before Christmas too. I didn't go back home to see relatives because I was so ashamed of myself. I couldn't hardly look anyone in the eyes for weeks. I'm doing pretty well right now but I just wanted to share my story in case someone has been pondering the idea of drinking again.
