I am writing this from an apartment we have rented in Sedona where my wife and I are spending a couple of months as "snowbirds".  When it is over we will return to a wonderful little house in the woods of New York state where we have many friends and are respected members of our community.  ..Life is good.  I am spending my time here taking photographs writing and working at staying right sized.  ..I would not be here probably would not even be alive had I not gotten sober 30+ years ago.  Every day is a gift - a gift I try to share because that makes it all the richer...Those of you who are struggling I am here to tell you it gets better easier and often in truly unexpected ways.  The only trick is to hang on stay sober and use the lessons that are provided in the process to help enhance the journey...It was about this time of the year that I first tried to get sober - chronicled here:     .https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/7uz4yz/an_agnostic_alcoholics_miracle_in_a_third_rate/..It took me to September 1 to find a way to stay sober.  It was not easy (in the beginning) but I am here to tell you it is so worth the effort.  .

Slip thanks for your steadfast support f everyone here!..We want to see some pictures!!
Go meditate on the Airport Mesa! It is magical.
Wow I read your linked post about getting sober. That was very eloquent and also funny.  The miracle of the titty bar.    Congrats and thanks for your wise words. 
Thanks for this read your old post and really identified with it. I am 35 but not far off from where you started your journey. Also an agnostic but things like AA and being sober help you see the miracles in life and my higher power is this amazing life and universe and my dog. Every day gets easier. My parents' house (always a bottle of vodka open) is usually a trigger and an irresistible temptation but I was there for a few hours yesterday and didn't think about touching the bottle because it would violate the new truth I've accepted about myself. I do have a disease and as they say in AA if you don't want to be a drunk it's simple don't take a drink.
This opened my heart. Thank you for sharing this Slipacre. I always pay attention when I see your username! Your contributions here are invaluable. I'm happy you're having an expansive adventure in such a wondrous place.
Thank you.
Thank you for sharing that. I'm glad you found your miracle. Wish I'd found mine sooner but at 46 I will take it. I'm an agnostic also &amp; perhaps my dogs can be my higher power too. Congratulations on your progress &amp; I really appreciate your story. Day 31. 
I think I would die if I stopped seeing you post here.
