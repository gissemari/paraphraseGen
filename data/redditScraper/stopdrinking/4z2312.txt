Kind of sad to wait to see the badge reset. I guess the good of it is that I have drunk less since January than in many years. I don't know if was the end of the honeymoon phase with s/d and non-drinking (is that the "pink cloud"?) but I haven't committed to the Daily Pledge nor read much here...I think by my lack of commitment I drank on vacation which led to cold beers on hot days. Finally sick and tired of feeling sick and tired. ..Thank you all who share here for your honesty and support. This is a good thing for me and I need to remember that. Here's to the first step of my sober journey!

 It IS great that you have all those days of sobriety in your pocket.  I know the day count is rewarding but a relapse doesn't take away what you accomplished this year already.  I think it's easier to quit again having that accomplishment in your past.  Congratulations for that and for starting again. 
My summer of relapses was followed by sobriety. I had sober support lots of positive brain washing etc. Before the summer of relapses it was years of buzz so that summer was my training wheels.
I'm right there with you buddy. Relapses aplenty. Hopefully a normal work agenda will help me. Good luck.
