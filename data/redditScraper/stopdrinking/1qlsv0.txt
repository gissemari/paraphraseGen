**But today it's mine!** One freaking year I would have never thought that I'll be able to archive that. Unbelievable. /r/stopdrinking was a huge part of this success story. Thanks to all of you you've helped me when I've struggled and gave me the opportunity to develop myself/sometimes even help others. ..A little more than one year ago I was at my personal bottom. I have .archived so much since then it's unbelievable:..* I've learned a lot about myself and accepted that I'm not perfect. I've expected that I'm not a loud and extrovert person. I've learned to be myself...* Feeling healthy and good. I've started to listen to my body how I feel. I've lost a significant amount of weight and enjoy looking into the mirror again. That's not only weight related but I've gained self-confidence and don't feel ashamed anymore...* A healthy relationship with a beautiful girl (met her shortly after I became sober and even wrote about it here in this subreddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/162p1d/ive_just_killed_the_main_argument_for_my_inner/)..* Instead of investing my time and energy in alcohol (drinking hiding curing my hangovers blackouts fights) I'm enjoying the simple stuff. Watching a movie or playing video games? Going out for a coffee? Awesome! I love it!...To everyone who is struggling and/or thinking about stopping for a while: It's worth it believe me. It's a lot of work a lot of ups and downs but for me It was definitely worth it!..Looking forward to another sober year!.

Congratulations it's a big deal! I see a lot of keeping it simple and great self-care in your post along with what I'm sure is a huge shift in your outlook on yourself and life in general from a year ago. It's called transformation. And here's the cool part: it's just beginning!
