It's been creeping up on me for a while.... Finally the Metamorphosis is complete and I Am Become My Own Mother.... that woman has Lists of her Lists!!..I've always struggled with procrastination and poor 'executive function' and been generally disorganised and bad at structuring my day/week/month etc.... Wonder if all the cider I was guzzling might have had something to do with it?..Earlier this week I made a To-Do List everything from 'Get up and shower' to planning a few meals and all the Odd Jobs around the place that have been piling up while I was drinking...Even big scary ones like 'Stop Smoking' and so on and other longer-term goals......Feels great to cross them off one by one and was able to pay a bill today on time that might otherwise have been forgotten about... Phew!..Hope that helps for anyone feeling a bit lost and disorientated today and not quite knowing where to start Life After Alcohol......I won't drink with you all today not on your Nelly!..Woody :>)>.
