I saw that somewhere not sure where but it has helped me to repeat it if I'm struggling with the urge to drink sometimes I repeat it out like like a mantra because I definitely don't want to! I'm on day ten or so have asked for a badge more than once but I can't seem to get one!   IWNDWYT

That's a saying I often forget usually when I need it the most and when it would help the most. Thanks for the reminder!
Here is [the link](http://sd.bot.nu/badgedate/) for the badge and make sure to hit the send button at the end. I've never had issues getting a badge/reset.
