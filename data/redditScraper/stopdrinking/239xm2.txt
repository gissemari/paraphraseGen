There I said it. Go ahead and freak out...Yes I know I'm doing sobriety for myself and I'm working the steps for myself but there is no way I could have done--or be doing--sobriety without the support of my wife. ..She threatened to leave me due to my drinking and then made the appt and drove me to detox. She voluntarily stopped smoking weed in support. She attends Alanon weekly. But most importantly of all she's there every night to "check me in" and make sure I've not been drinking. That's one hell of an accountability. Oh and did I mention that every night before bed she tells me how proud she is of my progress...Yes I need to fix myself. And I go to IOP and 5 or more meetings a week and am working the steps. But I also know that if I relapse the chances are damn good she'll leave me. So far that works. Whenever I bring this up the AA folks start to bristle and protest. While I know they mean well I say that not every person needs the same prescription. And not everyone is lucky enough to have an Elizabeth. Sniffle. ..Thanks dear...tl;dr: thanks to the wife for helping me get to 34 days!
