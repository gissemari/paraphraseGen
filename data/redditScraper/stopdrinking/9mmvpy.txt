I quit drinking for almost 6 months and relapsed about a year ago. I started thinking I didn't have a problem or could manage it but the reality has begun to hit me lately. I'd take my prescription naltrexone and Antabuse off and on to control my drinking but when I'd stop doing that I just got worse. I recently took a nasty fall and definitely will scar and might have some permanent damage but hopefully not. I also saw charges on my card from buying a drink somewhere I didn't even remember and don't recall anything about that night which is a first. I'm starting a better job soon and will have to get a car to commute and I haven't owned a car since my drinking got to the level it has now and I don't want to worry if I'd make a bad decision and drive when impaired. As I signed up for reddit again I saw a post on r/pics that showed a bride taking a photo in her wedding dress next to her fiances grave who was killed by a drunk driver. I think I should take that as a sign and I need to get serious about quitting. Thanks for reading.

That alcoholic brain of yours is a crafty one alright. ..What will you do differently this time round to avoid relapsing hard again?

Good for you!  Good luck!  IWNDWYT
Naltrexone worked for you in the past. Why not get a monthly vivitrol shot or naltrexone implant? No more skipped doses for months!
