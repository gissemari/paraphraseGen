TIL there are support groups on Second Life. I completely forgot that place existed. Outside of their definition of what complacency is (I don't agree that contentment is the same as complacency...complacent implies stagnation but that may just be my interpretation) good recommendations for fighting complacency here...Thanks for the link!..
Its nice to see you are vigilant and arming yourself in anyway possible to prevent relapse. I fell complacent last time and thatll get you without fail. It all starts with remembering only the good things about alcohol and turning a cheek to the inevitable bad. Everytime I catch myself thinking that way I force the bad thoughts in.. always prevents me from waving that 20 at the bartender or reaching at the shelf.
