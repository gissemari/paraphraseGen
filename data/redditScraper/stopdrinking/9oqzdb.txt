So I am just about as low as can be drinking and depression have ruined my life thrown in with some good old fashioned poor judgement.  ..I started AA and had a few good days unnder my belt and the bam huge fight with the ex I stormed out of the house and gave my kids a bit of a fright...All I wanted to do was go buy whisky and find myself some oblivion I have a meeting in the morning and need to be on form but the little voice said start drinking now you will have time to sort yourself out.  I struggled all the way home and managed to drive past the shops.  ..I eat and then the white knuckles were out the drinking was calling but I got in the car and went for a long drive and listened to an audio book.  ..It passed.  I did it I didnt do the one thing I have always done when shit goes south.  ..But I need to apologies to my kids.

Great job working through that one. Those are very hard situations to work through anytime but more so in the begining its extremely hard and you should be proud its a step at a time. Yes you need to make peace with your kids thats important speaking from experience. No drinks with you today.. Peace
Awesome job getting through the tough time! Driving past the stores and not turning back is hard!
