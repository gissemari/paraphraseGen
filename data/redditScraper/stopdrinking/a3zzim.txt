It's been that long since I've had a drink. That's crazy. I wouldn't have accomplished all that I have if I had been drinking. I'd most likely be dead by now. ..So here's my advice. Find what works for you but don't be afraid to try something new. If you don't like AA try SMART. I will tell you one thing that helped a lot was counseling. If you can't get to the root causes of why you drink you're more likely to relapse. ..Keep going. If I can do it so can you.
