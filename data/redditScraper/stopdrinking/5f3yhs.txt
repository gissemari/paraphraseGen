I drank last night and wasted today as a result with a monstrous hangover. I made it about a week sober before relapsing. Monday I seeing a new doctor and from the get go I'm going to tell her I'm an alcoholic and need support. I'm new to the area and don't have any sober friends or support for this. It's a start. I'm hoping she can refer me to some places. I've tried AA but it's just not for me. ..I will not drink today.

I will not drink with you today. This subreddit is a good place to find support.
I found stopping drinking became real when I was totally honest with my Doctor. Speaking to her and this community have made all the difference. Glad you're here :)
Awesome!  Honesty was my first successful step...I got tools resources support and fellowship and I've never been happier!..I wasn't keen about AA.  It however had been suggested by multiple sober people.  I stuck with a while and then 'magically' it became an essential component of my healing.
Good on you for being honest. You're on your way!
