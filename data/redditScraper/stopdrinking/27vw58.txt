The week's half over. Share your triumphs and struggles!..**Triumph**: I've been married for 17 years!  My wife and I just spent a wonderful weekend away to celebrate our 17th anniversary.  It's been an awesome 17 years with my best friend.  I'd say over the last few years of my drinking she worked hard to get to each next year.  But these last two have been earned by ME!  (I know it's silly but I've worked hard to be a better person and a better partner).  We had wonderful meals sat by the pool played some tennis and had some alone time.  It was fantastic...**Struggle**: I've got nothing...**General Chat**: I hope the weather holds out for my tennis match tonight.  My match last night was rained out.

My triumph is that I am on my second week of sobriety. It is almost miraculous to me...My struggle is that I wish life would stop for a bit and let me get a handle on living without alcohol--I wish I could just take it easy for a few days and wrap my head around this...but work is actually getting more and more stressful right when I would like a break.  I am going to tough it out but if it seems that my sobriety is suffering I will have to cut back on work...In general I am awfully proud of myself.  Inside I feel the sorta sadness of finality because I have come to accept that I cannot drink alcohol.  It just doesn't work for me and I have given up the fight.  Which is a relief but is anticlimactic as well.
I am three days in and feeling confident healthy and happy...I graduate in two weeks and my 100 page thesis needs to be at the printer's by Monday at the very latest. I can't edit fast ennnoouugghhh!!..Finally watched the Lego Movie last night-- "everything is awesome!" ;)

**Triumph:** for the first time I can remember I turned around after deciding to head to the liquor store.  I've never changed my mind at that point before.  I avoided a relapse and honestly felt pretty good about it after the craving subsided.  (I wrote about it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/27q7o3/help_me_not_drink_after_work_tonight_please/).)..**Struggle:** going through a divorce.  Wife is moving out at the end of the month.  I honestly can't wait to move on but it sucks at the same time too...**General chat:** I'm getting a lot more done and feel great but I know I have to be vigilant.  Getting cravings most days and it sucks.
