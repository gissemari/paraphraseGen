I'm 22 and a chronic alcoholic. I've quit more times this last year than I can begin to count. 2 days sober relapse. 5 days sober relapse. 11 days sober relapse. Sometimes I make it 30 days but usually I break at 1 or 2 weeks. I'm fed up with it but I'm going to try again. When I quit heroin two years ago I used AA and NA but I moved to a remote island with no meetings and decided I could drink because "I'm an addict not an alcoholic". Within a month of that first drink I was drinking 24/7 fighting off DT's and heart palpitations every single morning. I would shoplift a half gallon of vodka every day. I'm grateful I'm not like that anymore the last few months I've only drank about once a week but its NEVER my decision to do so. I just want to quit for good. I don't know what to change but whatever I'm doing now isn't quite cutting it even though I do see progress. Just checking in I guess I need to. Today I wont drink and I will concentrate on the days I don't drink instead of beat myself up about my seemingly constant relapses. Even if I cave tomorrow nothing can take away  from the fact that I spent today sober. Fuck. I hope I make it this time.
