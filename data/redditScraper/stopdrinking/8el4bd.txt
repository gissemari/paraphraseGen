Not sure what type of advice I am looking for but here is my story in short..My wife is struggling with a serious alcohol problem and it is ruining our marriage and family.  The daily pressure of dealing with it is really getting to me....

Hey - So sorry to hear. Sounds like you need some support group? Or are you trying to find a way to help her stop drinking? 
Have you tried Alanon yet? https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon..It might be helpful to hear from people in similar situations.
Where is your wife at on stopping?  Has she attempted to stop or is she still in the denying it is a problem mentality?  I ask because supporting someone who is trying to quit is far different from trying to convince someone to quit...A few years ago nothing you could say or do would have made me stop. I might try to hide it from you but I was set on getting drunk every night.  But now I am trying.  I have my weak moments and go back to drinking for a day or five days but I know I need to stop and I appreciate those who support me in that effort.
Al-Anon has a lot of resources and is for family and friends of alcoholics.  Maybe introduce your wife to this sight?  I can recommend the book This Naked Mind by Annie Grace helped a lot of people here look at alcohol in a different light.  She has a Youtube channel too.
