Wow!!! That's truly inspiring. Keep it up!!!!
And weed? Wow
Fucking amazing. Proud of you. I'm at 76/28. Days without alcohol/days without weed. Which was harder to quit? I'm craving the reefer hard and it's tough 
Great news. 
That's six years! A single relapse doesn't negate the whole year before it imo 
Congratulations! 
Congrats!.
