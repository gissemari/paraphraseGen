When I was 21 22 and 23 I made the same New Year's resolution every year: to not drink on more days than I drank. Every year I failed to follow through and I became progressively more disappointed in my inability to spend more than half my time sober. Looking back I knew I had a problem since I was of legal drinking age. But I thought I was  too young  or  too stressed  or  too whatever  to quit drinking. ..A bit more than a year ago I attended a friend's birthday party at a bar. I had been drinking every day for a week prior and I told myself that just for that party I wouldn't drink. I couldn't do it. Ended up having several beers. I can still taste one in my brain sickly sugary dark and tinged with a whole lot of guilt. ..Though I didn't know it at the time that was the last beer I'll ever have. The next day holed up in bed with a serious hangover I Googled  benefits of not drinking 1 day.  The search engine led me to stopdrinking I read a few posts took the test in the sidebar and my heartbeat got progressively louder in my chest. Surely I couldn't be an alcoholic! But I was trying too hard to talk myself out of it. I posted and commenters suggested I try to quit for 30 days. I did. It was a struggle. At the end of 30 days I felt so good I decided to stay quit. It's now been over a year. ..**Here are some things that have changed:** ..1. I got engaged! My relationship improved a millionfold when I stopped drinking. I stopped cheating yelling and generally being an idiot. ..2. I took up weight lifting and learned to windsurf. I've never been stronger or more active.. .3. I now get up early in the mornings like some sort of  adulting  robot it's actually f**king weird. I enjoy my weekends. ..4. I am no longer paranoid about ruining my friendships by saying stupid things while drunk. I haven't ruined any relationships with coworkers by making inane sexual comments or crying all over them. ..5. My relationship with my family has improved and my mom is proud of me. ..6. I no longer live in filth. ..7. I learned how to do so many things. I'm more creative.. .8. I feel free from the black cloud of anxiety guilt and sadness that was following me around and directly caused by alcohol. ...**Some things haven't changed:** ..1. I still feel really awkward at parties and I don't have SO many friends. Not drinking made some of my friends less inclined to hang out with me. That's okay. ..2. My job is still stressful as hell. At least I'm not adding to it with substance abuse. ..3. Occasionally I'm mean annoyed or annoying. And I have to confront it sober. ..**Here's what worked for me:** ..1. I'm a researcher by nature so I read everything I could find about quitting drinking. Allen Carr was useful in reframing alcohol as poison but I got the most emotional mileage out of reading Caroline Knapp's Drinking: A Love Story. Any study on the internet about the benefits of not drinking I read it. ..2. I told EVERYONE that I didn't drink anymore. There was no sneaking out of this. ..3. I essentially stopped going to bars. I go to bed early. My mom always says  nothing good ever happens after midnight  and I basically believe her...4. I poured all my booze out. Even though my roommate wanted to cook with it. I don't buy it for parties. LA CROIX and mocktails all the way! ..5. I took steps to make myself mentally healthy. I practice compassion. Like I literally practice feeling compassionate emotions. I try to make commitments and follow through. Committing to not drinking made me realize that I can do anything. ..I'm so much happier and healthier. Thanks stopdrinking for showing me the path I needed to walk down. I am really grateful for this community you ALL are the best. .

Nice post!  I appreciate your honesty about everything not being 100% rainbows and butterflies when you got sober.  Sometimes life is still annoying and hard but it doesn't mean that we have to drink. Thanks so much for sharing and congrats :)
