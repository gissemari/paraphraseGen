We all fuck up sometimes. The fact that you want to stop shows there's a fire inside of you still lit. Brush the dirt off and keep trying! This early in my sobriety I'm really distancing myself from my friends that go out to focus on myself. I don't really care if they think I'm lame or whatever I want to work on being sober. These early parts of sobriety are an uphill battle don't beat yourself up. Just keep looking forward!..IWNDWYT
