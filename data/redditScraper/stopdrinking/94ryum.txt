I've been waiting to post because i'm shy and i was reading around seeing how the community is.  I've been watching prison shows to scare me straight and its working. i have BPD and when i drink its never a good time. i'm terrified ill end up in prison one day...I was sober for 1.6 years because of my horrible dangerous binge drinking. i didn't really count it as sobriety because i didn't think i had a problem until i started "reintroducing alcohol" again and my behavior went completely insane. i drank to black out every two days (i had to skip a day to sleep). Quit my job  in one weekend i pissed myself twice at my in-laws threaten to kill myself to my husband multiple times started self-harming almost had an affair and that's just the stuff i'm willing to admit.... all in the span of three months.  The thing is i used to do the same things before i was sober and i completely forgot!..What i'm learning about myself is that i have a problem and I've always HAD a problem.

i'm glad you're here. ..&gt;The thing is i used to do the same things before i was sober and i completely forgot!..it's amazing how our brains manage to draw blanks on the major reasons why we don't drink. i've experienced this too. i think most of us have...&lt;3
Welcome back!..I am back after a relapse too. Sometimes I get into a state that I can only describe as  psychosis' where I completely lose touch with reality when drinking. I see things and believe things that aren't real; I feel like being in a  dream' where I can do everything without consequences (like stabbing someone). It truly terrifies me because I can get so out of touch (believing I am part of an CSI episode if I have watched that often) that I think I could actually harm someone  playing out/being in a csi scene'. ..No idea if this makes sense to anyone but it terrifies me.
