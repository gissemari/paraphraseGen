I have been so encouraged by the posts from you all; those struggling like me and from those doing so well.  I just wanted to check in this evening. I have felt aweful today...just overall aweful. But I made it past my craving hour with actually no desire for a drink and felt so much better after. I know I'm going to do this!!.Love to all...Nite..
