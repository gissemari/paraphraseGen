When I had my last dance with the devil my decision to stop drinking simply came down to asking myself: "Do I want to live or die?" I thank my guardian angels family and friends to see me with nearly a year and a half of sobriety under my belt. I was given a second chance at life and I am forever grateful for this.  My father on the other hand is being moved into intensive care and the doctor said it does not look good. It's not a death sentence yet but he's literally got the climb of his life right now...It's not easy folks. Drinking is a choice but for most of us here we have to climb Mt. Everest to choose our lives over the bottle. We are all on the same journey to summit sobriety only our own two legs can carry us there. No one else can carry us on their back to the top. If you succeed though life is fucking beautiful at the top I promise you that. Sure life can still get ugly after finding sobriety but nothing can knock you down as hard as alcohol (or drug of choice) ever did...I'm praying for my Dad. Hopefully he gets the opportunity to see the top...Much love and empathy to all of you who are struggling. One foot in front of the other one second one hour and one day at a time. You will get stronger even if you lose your balance on the way to the top.
