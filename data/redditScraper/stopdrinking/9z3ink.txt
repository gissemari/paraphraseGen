Hi all! It's been some months since I've posted -- and since I've really worked on myself. I just feel really lost and depressed and I could use a few internet hugs...I'm tired of drinking but it's something I find myself *doing* anyway. It's like that with a lot of things though like dieting and exercise accomplishing things around the house. Even in interpersonal relationships I find myself wondering why I do the things I do and say the things I say. I just feel like I'm in this place where I just float along letting things happen to me...I already took a shower and brushed my teeth and I'm half dressed (I actually stopped to post here lol). I have a ton of cooking to do today and a couple errands to run so I'm just trying to take it all one step at a time...Thanks for listening
