"Keep the issues and take away the drugs.And I had to find out who I really was" - Macklemore..I'm fighting my demons left and right these days.  Well left right and in front of me behind me and all over...Some days are good.  Many days are not.  I'm trying to surround myself with friends and people that care for me but even with that my struggles feel so deep I feel like there is no hope even though I know that is not true...It's been 174 days since I've had a drink and months since even marijuana or anything else illegal.  In the meantime I've become addicted to caffeine chocolate and nicotine.  Doctor prescribed Lexapro and Remeron which seem to have some positive effect but my average day feels "4 out of 10" on the happiness scale...Four months after I quit drinking my biggest demon came out. Sexual abuse that started at age six.  I had repressed this my entire life essentially.  I never even told my lovers about it I told myself it didn't impact me at all.  Amazing how we can lie to and deceive ourselves so well.  It wasn't until age 32 (I'm 36 now) that I came out as bisexual and just this year that I came to terms with my sexual abuse...When this demon surfaced I got very very angry at religion and my parents.  My parents are conservative and my father still hasn't come to accept my identity.  My mother doesn't even use the right term (gay vs bisexual).  We currently aren't speaking largely due to my hostility with them (started when the demon came out).  I have no idea how to approach this.  I try not to think about it.  They don't feel empathetic to me. ..I'm seeing good doctors and they are helping but I am frustrated with the slow pace of progress.  The past two years I've had suicidal ideation most days.  And a lot lately.   Even though I'm intelligent and financially secure life just feels difficult and uphill at every turn.  I'm confused about my role on the planet.  I seek out discussions about free will determinism philosophy etc. I enjoy helping people so I try doing that.  But it is only a minor dopamine boost .. nothing compared to the reliable consistent boost that drugs and alcohol provided. ..Is the six month mark always this hard?  When will life ... feel more rewarding?   ..I really want to stop feeling like I want to die so often.  ..I no longer desire alcohol. It simple isn't a path I want to follow anymore.  The urge to use marijuana is there however.  But I abstain nonetheless.  I almost feel like I was overall happier when I was drinking.  This is so confusing and hard.  I'm tired of feeling dull and sad.  I'm tired of the uphill.
----------immediate responses--------

I had and have my own array of issues and demons. Getting sober didn't resolve them but I believe it stopped the downward slide. Since then I have learned over and over that my best recourse is to associate with other people who have similar problems. I identify with and relate to them and many further along the curve than I am set examples from which I can learn. For me this has been participation in Alcoholics Anonymous which is central to my recovery and for which I am grateful. I'm glad you're availing yourself of outside help and wish all the best to you.
