Checking in - today was the first day it was hard for me. Yesterday I went bar hopping with friends but was so into making the bartenders make me mocktails everywhere we went (if anyone in NYC is ever at the Library Hotel Bar and needs something delicious and dry they made me several killer virgin mojitos).So that was easy. .Today I was having a lazy day around the house - just went to the gym at 10 got home at 11.30 and basically struggled all day. I kept myself as busy as I could - laundry cooking threw some things out watched a horror movie read a little bit of a book read this sub a whole lot showered napped planned my outfit for tomorrow checked work email - and it's crazy because that sounds like a lot when I type it but I'm realizing just how much time I spent being drunk and feeling shitty because of it. There is so much time on my hands that I'm not used to and today I spent more time than I'm comfortable with thinking about having a drink. I didn't! And that's awesome! But I really really thought about it a lot. I just kept reminding myself how much work I have to do tomorrow (was out sick most of last week) and how much better id feel if I just didn't start in with the bourbon. It worked today! I'm trying not to get ahead of myself and start worrying about all of the days to come that it might not work the talking myself down and convincing myself I've made the right choice to abstain. I'm trying to just be grateful it worked today...So here's to Day 8 finishing up and to a hopeful Day 9 tomorrow..IWNDWYT
