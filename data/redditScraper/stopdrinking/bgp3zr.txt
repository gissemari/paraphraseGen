I've tried a few times before to stop drinking lasting anywhere from 3-10 days but usually my partner would continue drinking and therefore I'd give in to my cravings and falter..His family picked him up early on Monday and took him to rehab it'll be his first time there. .We live together with our dog and I haven't been alone in the house for years. I took off work for a few days to give myself a less stressful environment to go through my mild withdrawal symptoms but I'm realizing it was probably a bad idea. I've tried reaching out to friends but I cancel plans at the last minute because I can't stop looking around the house and crying. He's not here. I know he's where he needs to be I know he's getting the help he needs with his alcoholism and his depression I logically know this is the best thing for him - but now I'm struggling. .I don't know what facility he's in and I'm not allowed to contact him. His family was quite cruel to me when they picked him up and they said they'd call me next week and give me an update but that he would be gone at least a month if not three. Add a 15000 multiplier to my anxiety when I heard that last bit. .I openly admit that I have a problem. I'm in therapy and I'm trying to better myself but it's so much harder with him gone..I'm really committed this time to quitting drinking once and for all I just didn't realize how much worse it would be alone. .Everything online says not to do it by yourself but I don't have any other option. My family is far far away and I'm not open enough with any of my friends to ask for their help. In fact they were all shocked to find out my partner went to rehab (he asked me to tell them so they wouldn't worry when he didn't answer his phone).I just can't go to rehab myself. Someone has to take care of our dog. I can't afford a kennel or a dog daycare I can't afford to take time off of work and even if I could I absolutely can't afford rehab with my crappy insurance. .I guess I'm just reaching out to a community full of people who can relate hoping for some words of support or wisdom or both.

I'm so sorry for what you are going through. I have no advice other than to keep reaching out for support. Find an AA or SMART recovery meeting in your area and keep checking in here.
