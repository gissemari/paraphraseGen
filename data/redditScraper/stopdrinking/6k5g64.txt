Last night I was leading a group for recovering addicts mostly alcoholics. I do not disclose my own struggles with addiction to clients mostly due to my chronic relapsing. (I expect the next question to be "Oh how long have you been sober?") ..One lady in particular was talking about her own job and working with those in recovery. She said "I work with people who have been sober longer. I feel like a fraud." This struck me because my own clients have been sober weeks months *years* longer and yet they're coming to *me* for help with their recovery? I can't even get my own shit together...I could not relate more to a client's words. I feel like a fraud. I'm leading groups and seeing individual counseling clients and encouraging them and building skills... so why can't I do the same?..Anyone out there in the same boat?
