I'm 8-months out and haven't drank any alcohol.  I do have a long history of heavy drinking on nearly a daily basis.  There's no question that I was addicted.  I read the book 'This Naked Mind' and I've applied the principles the author recommends and I can say without a doubt that it works.   I'm not going to say that I'm never tempted to drink.  However  I don't drink anymore and I don't ever plan to do so again.  Its just not a struggle anymore.  I understand that a lot of people have a stronger addiction than others.  I just took it to heart that I'm not going to be a perpetual 'recovering' alcoholic.  I'm done with it once and for all.   I highly recommend the book and applying the principles as directed.

Congrats! I'm also a fan of TNM. 
Congratulations on 8 months. Awesome. IWNDWYT   
Great work! I also credit TNM for changing how I view alcohol and I remember its teachings whenever I start getting cravings or FOMO. IWNDWYT :)
I wish my family and friends would read this book. .It's definitely a life changing book if you use alcohol in a social setting. It takes away the stigma that you're the one with the problem if you decide not to drink 
It really changed my mindset completely - read it twice!
