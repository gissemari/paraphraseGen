Hello all I just want to get this feeling off my chest. Trigger warning: cocaine use. ...I had a super vivid drinking dream the other night- the second I've had so far. This time I was sipping beer and it tasted so real. I was disappointed in myself for relapsing and the shameful feelings continued even after I woke up. ...I think the dream was triggered by an event I went to last week with lots of booze. It was at a place I used to get smashed at and all my friends were drinking big pints. It was a special occasion so I stayed until a little after midnight but the party raged on. I abstained but I still felt bad I missed out on a "good time" by leaving early. My partner stayed up drinking and doing lines with our friends and I was actually really jealous of that. He said he felt horrible the following day and wants to try to take a break from drinking/ drugs. I'll support whatever he wants to do! He stopped using coke for months before this night (I've been clean about a year now) but he admitted he's been thinking about it non-stop lately. I want to share with you what he said because it sort of helped put some things in perspective for me. He is talking mostly about coke but I think it applies to our obsession with alcohol too:...&gt; I woke up today feeling like death but this is what I wanted. This exact shitty feeling is what I've been obsessing over and craving for months. So I told myself I deserved it you happily made this bed now suffer in it....It's harsh but sort of true. Of course I consoled him and I could relate. There's nothing quite like the anxiety of the day after and I've had my share. He is doing fine now btw. But now I'm trying to think of what he said when I want to taste beer to socialize with a drink in hand and laugh drunkenly with friends. That's never the whole truth of what I'm craving because those positive memories go hand in hand with crippling pain and the darkest times of my life. ...It's Friday and although I'm tempted IWNDWYT! Tomorrow is too precious to waste.

Wow that's an interesting way of thinking of it! Congrats on 38.
It's friday night and I have just had a feeling of wanting a drink. I'm currently fighting it. I've always struggled with crippling anxiety the day after. Hellish times. If coke is involved im even more of a wreck (used very rarely). ..I wonder if a self loathing part of me feels i deserve it. Any sorry for moaning. Well done on not drinking today!
