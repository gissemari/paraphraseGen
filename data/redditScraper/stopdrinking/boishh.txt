My days is consecutive. My sobriety date is August 10th 2010. One white chip. Many blue...Were I to relapse on a drunk I feel I would need to go back to day 1. In my community of sobriety people who keep a count going after a relapse are considered to be liars and having a fake sobriety date. The count that seems to matter to most is days consecutive not accumulative...To those who count the combined days with relapses in between does this hurt you? Also what justifies your count to you? I'm purely coming from a place of wishing to understand that I may be better at being supportive.

The count is just a number.  So is I've been 99% sober the past few years.
For my part I don't see why I would care how anyone else describes their  count 
Eh not my badge not my business. It's too exhausting
Each to their own.  If it doesn't impact me it's not my place to have an opinion...Whatever method someone uses to keep fighting the addiction is okay with me so long as it doesn't negatively impact others.  It is an individual battle after all.
