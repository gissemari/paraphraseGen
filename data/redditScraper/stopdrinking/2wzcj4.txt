I was a chronic relapser and one of the things that I found was that I was lying to myself about how much I was relapsing and what effect it was having on my life. Two things that really helped change my perceptions and understanding included:..* Print out a year calender and use a highlighter to mark the days I drank. I don't try moderating so it was any amount of drinking. If you are trying to moderate then use two different colors to distinguish between the two. It was eyeopening to **see** just how few days I was actually staying sober and how long each relapse lasted. Print it out and put it somewhere you can see it. Make it real. ..* Track your drinking against things that are important to you. For me it was sleep. I made a spreadsheet to track what time I woke up against whether I drank the night before continuous days sober and continuous days drinking. In hindsight I would have added amount I drank and time I went to sleep. I used the data to make a graph and do a correlation analysis. It soon became clear just how much of a negative impact drinking had on my sleep how sleep deprived I was and how much of a positive impact continuous sobriety had on my sleep. ..Neither of these will keep you sober but they do help to remove a layer of BS and create some clarity with simple visual messages. Before these I thought I was drinking maybe 50% of the days each month - turns out it was closer to 90%. Just a thought.....

Good suggestions.  Thanks for sharing this g_f.
Yes we need use any tool at hand to cut through the rationalizations justifications blame and outright lies we tell ourselves.  I for one was quite deluded 
Nice!  Thank you

Very cool. I am definitely a fan of charting intake. Thanks for this!
The calendar is a great tool.  For me it changes stark numbers into time which is much more effective for me.  Binged? Mark it.  A shot with cocoa? Mark it. Here's my [attempt at moderation](http://imgur.com/AkVhCVK) after the holidays. I thought I was doing pretty good too but really that's a lot of black. (Yea I need a '15 calendar just using the back of the old one for now). Looking at the last couple of weeks though makes me feel damn good despite that little blob on the 14th :)
Good advice - I started keeping track of every drink I had and it was very interesting to me.  So I usually drank at home and it was easy.  Basically I kept a notepad by the place I make my drinks.  I'd measure out 2oz of alcohol into a glass then mix it and then before I'd start drinking it I would put a tick mark on that notepad.  That's all....something simple and easy to do...After a few weeks I looked back and found I was drinking more than I thought I was.....so I quit reviewing the stats and just drank.  HOWEVER I continued to keep track of my drinking for 2 years doing this same method.  I just never reviewed the stats...When some shit in my life finally went sideways I began to look at my history and the patterns were abundantly clear.  I kind of surprised myself that I was drinking as much as I was and as often...I remember a 5 day sobriety period and thought "Oh that was only a few weeks ago I'll do that again."  Well it was more like 3 months before and I'd pretty much been drinking every day since that time...I couldn't deny the data tho and it's one thing that really helped me see my drinking patterns and it helped me.  
Very helpful! One other shocker I've have is measuring my 'drinks' against a real 'standard drink' amount. It ended my free pour days and really made me stop and look at what I was doing. That 'double scotch' I was pouring for myself was really more like 4-5 drinks.
There is an Android app simply called Stop Drinking Alcohol that works like your calendar/highlighter idea.  You click the day green if you haven't drank or if you did you can enter how many drinks you had and the day slowly changes to red the more you enter.  It also marks your sober streaks for you.
I like habitbull for android.
I did a similar calendar thing &amp; it really helped me! I started cutting down one year ago I would put a big black "x" on the dates on the calendar when I drank and a green smiley face on the dates I was sober. Wow at first it was mostly black "x"s. Over the course of the year I had more and more green smiley faces. Progress! Now I'm all green smiles &amp; in it to win it. Congrats to you and thank you for sharing! :-)
For me what works is reciting Step One with a small modification...  .."I admit that I am powerless over alcohol * **and always will be** * and that my life had become unmanageable"  ..By transferring it to First Person it hits deeper and by adding those 4 words it becomes more permanent.  ..Sometimes it's easy for me to be sober in good times but when trouble hits I need this to remind myself why I don't drink. Also February is easy...what's hard is walking past a patio in the hot summer sun and seeing the people enjoying their frosty lagers. That's when DrunkVoice starts to whisper in my ear that just one wouldn't hurt me after all this time. Nope. I was powerless when I quit and any thoughts that I can moderate are lies and will lead me into a relapse. No thanks. I had enough when I quit I've had enough today and I've had enough tomorrow. I'm powerless and always will be.
Great post!..Using the Sleep Cycle app had a very similar effect for me.  The app tracks when I went go to bed how long I sleep for the quality of my sleep etc.  The app also allows you to set up sleep notes things like "drank coffee" "ate dinner late" or "drank alcohol."  It enables you to see how certain activities effect your sleep...It was very eye opening to see the negative effect alcohol had on my sleep.  As gelastic_farceur mentioned it was also very eye opening to see just how few days I was sober.
I'm a chronic relapser and I really like your calendar idea. I've been seriously trying to quit for two years now and was roughly adding up the days I'd been sober it is almost 200. About 25%. I've been looking at it the opposite way as you it made me feel like even though I've failed a lot I still have made progress as a daily drinker for 10 years...I can see how looking at it negatively can be more helpful though because more often than not my relapses last longer than my sober days. This last one was nearly a month after 12 days sober...The tracking idea I like this as well though I might not get scientific with it. One reason I have had so much sober time relative to other parts of my life is by repeatedly trying I've come to legitimately like being sober. *A lot* of that comes from the different things I enjoy sober.. I drink coffee more I eat better I eat treats and juices and generally do more than basic feeding + beer. Just all around get to enjoy life more and I miss it when I drink now. Some way to tangibly remind myself of that sounds like a good idea.
I have been using [Drinkaware](https://www.drinkaware.co.uk/mydrinkaware/dashboard) for almost a year. You input the amount you drink into a calendar and it gives you some stats. I agree that keeping a history of your drinking can be helpful and I sometimes look through my history and find extra motivation to stay sober.
