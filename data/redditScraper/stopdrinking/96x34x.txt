* 90 AA meetings in 90 days - You dont necessarilyneed to say your name or share just sit and listen learn as much as you can. Personally I am almost a year sober I still go to meetings and love them. 90% of my network/friends are from AA and I wouldn't have it any other way..* Therapy.  Find a good therapist. Try CBT..* Make new sober friends (seriously let go of all your drinking buddies at least for the first 3-12 months.).* Whatever you do don't walk into bars or restaurants that are built for drinking/partying..* Find new hobbies.* Exercise.* If you're a guy find an AA mens group.  If you're a girl find a women's group. They are different from unisex meetings. I suggest doing both for a diverse experience..* Read the Big Book.* Do the steps as best as you can.  Take what works and if you must leave out the rest..* Bathe hygeine take care of yourself and if you dont know how to google it. Not even joking..* Let go of toxic friends family jobs.  At least for first 3-12 months. You'd be amazed..* Eat well.  Fruits salads seafood water.  You're prob deficient in vitamin b12 b6 omegas magnesium. .* Get a physical.* Have depression / anxiety?  Talk to a doc about getting meds if that resonates with you. Find new activities therapies and exercise regimes that help combat this.  Get the blood endorphins dopamine oxygen flowing in your body/organs.  This immensely helps with restlessness irritability discontent sleep problems depression anxiety..* If you choose rehab or detox...its helpful but not the cure!  Have a recovery program during and after you get out of any facility.  AA is a good one as it provides a sober network and tools to KEEP you sober teach you how to LIVE sober...once you get out of rehab/detox.  .* Ask questions lots of questions on SD its anonymous and a good way to get answers if you are too afraid to open up about struggles in therapy or in a meeting..* Clean your home move if it helps..* If you live with people who drink or use you could be enabling each other.  Help yourself..* Yoga meditation journalling..* Seek people older and wiser than you in a recovery program and ask them lots of questions..* Get a sponsor but select a sponsor wisely.  Its okay to upgrade sponsors as needed..* Get as much sober time as you can under your belt.  The longer you are sober the better you feel. and if you dont feel better...thats normal.  You will after 6-9 months...all it means is you have to work through issues and keep making changes to yourself your environment ppl you hang out with etc..* you WILL get out of debt.  I paid off a substantial amount quicker than I believe I would..* Miracles are inevitable..* Quit beating yourself up!.* Listen to music its therapeutic. .* Cry and cry as much as you need to - you WILL be feeling all those feeling you numbed all those years..* Yes it is normal to cry or be bored/irritable for days weeks months.  This WILL pass. I am just over 8 months sober and so many positive things in my life have happened.  Little miracles and big ones..* You will grow in massive ways for the better. Even the little growth will FEEL like massive growth. Either way it is positive. .* Get the 'quit drinking' app..* Find a new reward system..* Yes you will eat sugar or be hooked on coffee for a few months once you stop drinking.  This too shall pass.  Try a fruit smoothie..* On social media? Hit the block button on any old drinking buddies or toxic friends. You dont need peer pressure. You need supportive healthy people.  Don;t be afraid to add more mentors and positive influencers into your life..* Youtube 'The Doctors Opinion AA" on YouTube..* Write a gratitude list daily..* Give thanks for your sobriety..* Try Al-anon if you had an alcoholic family member..* Call / google the AA 24 hr help line if you have questions. .* Getting help is an act of courage strength and hope - not a weakness.  .* Most importantly you cannot quit an old life without building a new one.  You MUST replenish the space by creating a new life new habits new thought patterns take initiative to HEAL yourself with professional help. (Develop a sober support system and take the suggested action steps.)  Otherwise you may leave yourself susceptible to chronic relapse pain and the cycle of shame/trauma/stronger addiction/hopelessness.  .* Find alcoholics that have built a new life and be open to following their suggestions.  Their transformation is living proff that what they are doing works.  Take suggestions from multiple *recovered alcoholics.* They are often a better resource than therapists and doctors *alone.  Hence use* ***combination*** *therapies support systems tools action-steps.* It will build and solidify a stronger foundation for you..* Hope that helps. :)

Great list!  This is very helpful. Thank you!
Copied and pasted to my Notes thanks!..IWNDWYT
Such a wealth of wisdom! Thank you for sharing.
Massive appreciation to you for writing this list. It's a great resource - so much of it is stuff I feel is helping with my recovery. Glad to know I'm not alone. 
Great list.   Thank you for sharing it. I feel like the separate remarks on tears sugar and abstinence being the remedy were important to me. Keep on keeping on. 
Amazing list! Thanks!
Every single line is inspirational. I can  imagine you have learned them from trial and error for a long time which makes this list invaluable. Thanks very much. IWNDWYT. 
Great list! I was wondering when will somthing simmilar appear and here you are with your post! Great job keep pushing! :) 
I heard someone I respect say the following about treating depression and I think it works here also:.."Pull all the levers you can to make yourself better"..This is a fantastic list of levers. I'm learning alcoholism is a persistent and odious disease and throwing everything you can at it is the best way to increase your odds of beating it. Thanks for your insight...IWNDWYT
Wow this is huge. Thanks for compiling this even nearly 5 years in I found a few things in there that I can add to my own program of recovery. ..&gt; Bathe hygeine take care of yourself and if you dont know how to google it. Not even joking. ..I'm not at all ashamed to say that this is a very good point. It took years but finally I am able to do my laundry regularly and shower daily even when I feel shit. It felt so validating to learn that I wasn't alone on that one...All the best!!
Thank you so much and Happy Monday!
Very awesome list. Thank you so much for sharing!
Really helpful.Thank you 
This is a wonderful list - thank you! I really like that you've included so many things.  Someone may not want to do ALL of these but you have provided so many options to choose from.  It is always a nice reminder to be kind to yourself.
