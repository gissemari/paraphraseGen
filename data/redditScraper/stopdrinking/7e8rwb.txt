The last time I quit drinking I became a hermit for almost 3 months because I was terrified to leave the house.  When there is booze everywhere it's hard to trust yourself.  Even when I did start venturing out I was extremely anxious and uncomfortable for quite a while.  My family could not understand it...They thought I was just being anti-social.  ..I went over two years sober but unfortunately recently had a relapse.  I'm back to 5 days sober now and hurting.  It was a stupid mistake and I'll learn from it...I don't have the luxury this time of staying home for a few months and am venturing out today for the first time.  Once again I'm terrified.  There is still booze everywhere.  Ripe for the picking...My point is this: booze makes me terrified to leave my own home and see the wonderful world outside.  That's insane.  And stupid.  I'll be glad when I regain some control over it again.

Good news is that we're right here with you and so you have someone to talk to about this stuff provided that you are sober enough to put a few words together...I didn't go out much when I was drinking and that was actually a good idea for me. I got in so much trouble after I drank and went out side so staying in was much safer. Other people instructed me that was a good choice in my case..
Good luck with gaining control. They do let people who have been drinking into most AA meetings. They often ask that you do not share because they believe that it will be the booze doing the talking not you and don't want to hear drunken rambling.
