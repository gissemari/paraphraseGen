Need to play the clock forward realise I'm not that person any more but my body keeps saying just get drunk one last time then quit. Even though it will fuck up my plans for today and tomorrow. I got a month sober and was changing in to the person I wanted to be until that one drink slowly got me back in to the rut I was in. I can't drink again I've had my last drink it's like I'm subcnciously scared to admit that to myself. That I can never curl away from the world clutching a bottle of rum. I'm not the mistakes I made I am the person here right now saying I will not drink.

my sobriety only lastas 18 hours or so...after every binge i say "its not worth it I'm over it now"..then the next night something just gives in me and I decide to just go for it again whats another 6 pack..I really must hate myself deep down or something.. maybe I think I'm worthless
