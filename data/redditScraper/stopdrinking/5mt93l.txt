I've been at this for 3 years but for the past year I genuinely have wanted to be sober more so than I have wanted to be a normal drinker. This has been the major difference in my mindset. It was difficult for me to come to terms with the fact that I would never be able to moderate. Those days are in the past and there is nothing wrong with looking fondly upon them as long as you are okay with moving forward. This time around I had to ask myself "how many relapses am I willing to endure before I finally accepted that drinking was never going to be the same as it used to be? How many times am I going to have to learn this lesson? How many detoxes IOP's and half-assed efforts was I going to put in?"..This time around:..No weed. For me I could not get over the mental obsession component of addiction if I was redirecting it from alcohol to another substance as harmless as people claim that it is...No half-assed efforts. I have to be all-in on this. There is no more picking and choosing which parts of treatment I'm going to do because they are convenient for me and my mindset. My mindset is warped from substance abuse. In what way is it trustworthy? I opened my mind and listened to the people around me who had figured out a way to stay sober. Something I had yet to achieve. ..Long-term Treatment. For me I had to change my setting. I went to an in-patient treatment facility for 30 days. I learned about the biology of the brain in regards to addiction. I opened up to counselors and new friends about my struggle and was honest about how I felt for the first time in a long time. I attended AA and did everything that I was asked from the staff. This included going to a half-way house for another 30 days after treatment. There I received the education I needed on how to live successfully in sobriety. I tried to be as much of a sponge as possible. Fuck my instincts they are driven by ego lust and self-centered fear. I decided to let other people make decisions for me for a little while. And low and behold my life has gotten better. I currently live in a sober house with friends I met from that half-way house. For me I had to get away from old friends who wanted to bring me down with them convinced that I was missing out on their amazing lives of smoking weed and playing video games all day. ..Continuing the process. There are a lot of mixed feelings about AA on here and in other threads but for me its been working. I've met some very good people in the program who have a lot of sober time and what I'm looking for in life. (Healthy marriage fulfilling career kids nice things spiritual fulfillment.) I go to a meeting every night and socialize with like-minded people. I have a home group that I go to every week and have a job in that group. I did my first commitment last week and while nerve wracking at first felt amazing afterwards. I have a sponsor who is about 6 years older and has 7 years sober. I am beginning to work in the book and am looking forward to learning more about myself and this process. ..Life is good everyone deserves to give themselves a chance. Again I am not preaching my process but this is what has been working for me so far. Listening to the people who know what they're talking about and having an open mind about what has worked for other people. Over the past three years I have put together 1 month then 40 days then four months and now 5 months my new personal best. ..Happy Sunday and good luck to you all!
