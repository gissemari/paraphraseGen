In my lifetime (I've survived 32 years thus far) I'm hoping science and technology are able to manipulate the aging process enough that I can out-sober /u/badgebot. I would never wish relapse on any person but BadgeBot I look forward to the day you post "RESET" and then like 22000 years later I hit 7.9 million days.
