I'm somehow still sober and the urge to drink has just left me. I was away from my home for 10 days and went to only one meeting during that time and my recovery routine quickly became non existent. ..The urge to drink crept back over a period of 2-3 days. It went from random thoughts to longing idolizing stomach-churning and finally to planning a relapse. I never stayed sober before when I got to the planning stage. Right now I'm sitting on a ton of money and I just don't understand how I'm sober. I know how I'm sober but I will never really understand.....I was on a plane for 16 hours and it got to the point where my head was just lying to me. My relapse was going to be different it was going to be only one night nobody will know and I will return to my group like nothing had ever happened. I believed it. I was sold. I could taste it all. It was going to be beautiful. Throughout that flight I would occasionally pray and try to think of my family and friends of another job I will lose being homeless broken again etc...None of that really registered. ..Then I opened facebook and saw my friend's post: "18 months clean and sober. It works if you work it!" I don't know why that post brought be back to reality but it did. My relapse plan suddenly became a reality and not an idiotic fantasy. I felt that well known misery despar confusion hopelessness agony and fear. The urge went away.. .Thank god for AA and everything it has given me. I hope I never forget this day. Deep down I think I know why my urge went away for today. If it can happen today it can happen on any day. Thank you all for this community.

Finding stuff that helps out in a problematic situation is gold. And what to avoid--neglecting what works for you maybe. ..I don't get scared a lot but I get uneasy when I start having random thoughts about how easy it would be to have a drink. I run back to some aspect of my routine and sort of re-up my commitment. ..Glad you made it through today OK. 
&gt; I will return to my group like nothing had ever happened...This thought really scares me because it's one that pops up all the time... just one sip one little drink; you can still tell people your sober... ..The fact is... it's not really about anyone else any other group it's about Myself/Yourself it's your health your life your integrity your conscience. Learning not to lie to myself is one of the hardest lessons that will forever be the backbone of this course alteration...
