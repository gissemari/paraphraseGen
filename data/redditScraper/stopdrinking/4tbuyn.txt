So I am making another go of stopping drinking I have tried a few times and always relapsed and when I train for a marathon I will usually stop for a few weeks and then start drinking from the finish line. ..I think none of my friends take me seriously when I say I have a drinking problem I never get in fights or hurt myself when I am blackout drunk so I think most of them can't see the problem. One of my closest friends is a non-drinker her father is an alcoholic thankfully in recovery and she is adamant that I don't have a problem. She is happy that I want to quit and she knows the reasons why but compares me to her father who some of her siblings still refuse to speak to because of his past drunken behaviour and insists that I don't have a problem. Other friends laughed when I mentioned it a few nights ago over beers of course there is no problem with having a few post-work beers and how could I be an alcoholic I am an athlete. Of course I get home to my apartment drink alone until 2 am wet the bed and turn up late for work...I have lived in several countries and I always found that the best way to make new friends was to go out drinking in bars where the foreigners hang out. I've always been known as a big drinker when I visit friends back home their wives roll their eyes because they know I'm taking their husbands on a bender. I am the excuse for these guys to go out and have fun. ..I need to quit for various reasons but I always found my friends were tempting me too much and I would break. I don't want to cut everyone out of my life but I don't know how to handle this.

It seems like there are some people who would describe you as someone with a problem whereas some would not. ..We are social animals and the way I see myself is in part framed by how others see me...But when it comes to my mental health and addiction: people can't see the real torment I put myself through. ..They might have seen me have two glasses of wine at dinner and leave early because I had to work. If I approached these dinner party guests and said I had a drinking problem they might say "uhh no you don't you had two glasses of wine and turned in early for work!"..What they don't see is me going home and drinking a bottle of vodka and calling in sick...People see parts of my story and make characterizations of who I am based on that. But they don't have a clear vision. 
Hi and Welcom /u/Itsalloveranyway you have found a great place. I can relate to your story. I also go out to meet people in bars and end up drinking way too much. I found a post by /u/coolcrosby called baby steps it has helped me greatly. You can find it at https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2gg9tp/where_to_start_stopping_the_baby_steps/ . Also I find that hanging out here and meeting people in the same place helps me get there. Some people really helped me yesterday getting through a rough patch. I will really like not drinking with you today.
