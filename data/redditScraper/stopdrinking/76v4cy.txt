It's been a little over two months since I've last drank. I'd like to go over some of the benefits I've experienced just to motivate some of you who might be struggling with this issue...The first thing I've noticed is my weight loss. Nothing too dramatic. I've lost about 6 to 8 pounds. The weight loss was immediate but did slow down after a few weeks. I've not changed anything in my diet. In fact I've been eating a lot more sweets as I'm craving sugar more. So now I find eating sweets is a new (bad) habit I will have to address in the future...My mood has been much improved. I rarely feel anxious depressed or angry now. I'm a pretty mellow person to begin with but now I feel much more calm and content. I feel happier. And I feel euphoric a lot of the times. I realize that the euphoric feeling won't last forever. But it's been good for now. My self-confidence has also improved...I have a lot more energy/motivation to do things that were burdensome in the past. Things like cleaning/chores shopping exercising.  I feel so much more positive and motivated nowadays...I've had some minor improvements in my skin complexion. I'm in my 50's. So any improvement (however small) is better than nothing! I had one co-worker say that I'm looking younger the before. She hadn't seen me in about six months...My liver tests (ALT) have greatly improved. They went from 27 U/L to 18 U/L in just two months!..My relationship with my wife has improved slightly. We don't fight anymore. We still get irritated with each other from time to time. But we're able to bounce back very quickly and the irritations don't turn into huge arguments or fights that last five days ..The most profound benefit in my opinion is all the money I have saved by not spending on alcohol. I'm so astonished at how much money I have left over after paying my monthly bills. I've been able to purchase some nice little toys and have been able to pay them in cash - and still have money left over. This has been one of the greatest benefits/motivators I've experienced...I cannot guarantee that you will experience these same benefits if you stop drinking. You might experience different ones. But I do think there is a great potential that you will reap these and other rewards by quitting alcohol...Later I will post tips/tricks I have used to make my first two months successful. For now I just wanted to highlight some of the benefits that I've experienced - just to motivate some of you out there who are struggling with this issue.  Good luck.
