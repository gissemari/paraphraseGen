I'm so fucking scared. I really don't want to have a seizure. I really binged drank yesterday and the days before. I'm a fairly small guy. I weigh 160lbs. When not addicted I have a fairly low tolerance. I will be drunk after maybe 4 or 5 shots over 2 or 3 hours. Now a half gallon lasts me 2-2.5 days max. No less. I drank about 3/4 of a half gallon yesterday. Maybe a little under 30 shots. I woke up feeling fairly hungover. Got my day going fairly well. Decided I would try and taper off alcohol today. Mildly atleast. I'd try to refrain from drinking until around 2 or 3pm. To substitute my lack of gaba and overexcitability of said receptors I would take some GHB which more or less will cover up the withdrawal. As soon as I took it (withing 20 seconds) I felt a huge zap go through my whole body. Then it hit me again even stronger. ..The best way I can describe the sensation:.In my eyes I felt a jolt sensation similar to going from a dark room to looking directly at the uninhibited sun. I felt a zap that felt like a split second of an the most intense anxiety attack imaginable. Such a powerful and scary sensation but in a "zap". It was strong enough that I fell to the floor. It hits me again. Then again. Immediately out of fear I try and stand up but slip and fall. I quickly pull the cabinet door open and grab the shitty bottle of Monarch and gulp down 3 massive swigs. I quickly run to the bathroom. I feel the zap again and the primal fear. I am anticipating it to kick in. Another intense zap. I take another 2 sips. This is a really scary situation. So much dread. ..I need to taper off of this diabolical drug. I don't even enjoy the effects very much. I am getting off of opioids and those withdrawals are so painful. Alcohol helps. I've relapsed on opioids over a dozen times so I always keep alcohol handy to "turn down the volume"...Now I feel the low dose of ghb taking hold. So now I'm getting nauseas. I planned on having a good day. Guess not...I can't believe that I need to drink this nasty shit just to stay away from a potentially life threatening situation. Been drunk every day for 11 or 12 months now. Not a great way to start my adult life. (Only 18 yrs old)..That's the only withdrawal symptom that I feel. I don't really have an above usual level of anxiety. I don't get shaky hands. Maybe the most mild of hallucinations (though I have HPPD so it's hard to say) Well fml. Gonna decrease my intake by 30ml per day. Starting at about 500ml. .....Well thanks for reading ladies and gentlemen. Guys and gals. Finally my heart rate has gone down. My hands aren't shaking anymore. ..Anyone ever had a similar situation. What does the onset of a seizure. I still am getting that sensation in my eyes that seems to leak and spill through the rest of my body but to a much smaller extent. Fml. Hopefully I can get some alplorazelam or something that aids better than ghb for WD (Unfortunately effects a different set of gaba receptors limiting it's effectiveness as a medium for serious withdrawal prevention. I feel like I can't drink enough to stave away this wierd "Jolt sensation" ..What a miserable withdrawal......Thanks for your time. As mentioned prior is this what the onset of an alcohol withdrawls seizure feels like? I can't imagine that this feeling is caused by anything else. I've heard that you could feel the seizures coming on. This just isn't how I imagined it to feel.....

Personally I would seek medical attention right NOW if I had the same type of symptoms.
Can you see a doctor about it?..It's better than leaving it up to chance or trying to self-medicate.....If you're only 18 I'd be surprised if you'd been drinking enough for long enough to really be in seizures territory yet but as far as I've heard they can strike without warning so it's best to see a doctor to be on the safe side.....Even a relatively run-of-the-mill case of withdrawal can be pretty miserable it's the sort of thing that you only want to go through *once* if you can possibly help it!..Best of luck and keep us posted.....IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
