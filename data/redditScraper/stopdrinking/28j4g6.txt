I woke up yesterday afternoon about 10 mins before my local nooner and I had to seriously had to ask myself if i i was sober and if I had been on a another serious bender...Usually my alcohol themed dreams have been casually drinking beers and thinking "this isnt so bad" or "damn i need another coin."..However this one was cold hard truth of the pain i felt after a bender. I had real intense imagery of me having insane anxiety apologizing to my new girl friend over something i had no idea of deleting drunk induced embrassing facebook comments and statuses and just flat out crying uncontrollably...I realize I didn't drink but for the whole day i felt like i had a legitimate reason to be feel guilty and shook. I am so grateful of how everything in my life has been revealed and being rebuilt and see now just how easy it is to step back into the self destruction and delusions. ..Was this a warning shot?

Maybe more of a reminder. This as your first *unpleasant* drinking dream makes it sound like sobriety is becoming more a way of life for you. If so drinking loses its attraction and becomes more consistently representative of just purely bad stuff. Nightmarish stuff. 
Drinking dreams are so common. There isn't a week that goes by on this Sub that one or two posts describe drinking dreams; this is a [link to a prior post and my comment on the question.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/20bm2h/i_had_a_dream_that_i_started_drinking_again/cg1mprd)  I'm not leaving it here because my comment was so brilliant as much as because there's an embedded link that you might find interesting...BTW I had sort of a "drinking dream" the other day.  I dreamed I was late ill-prepared and not properly dressed for an AA lead.  Yikes!
