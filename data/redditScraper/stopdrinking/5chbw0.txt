Hey all. ..I'm nearing week two of my sobriety and I've been spending a lot of time thinking about things I used to do. I've started to feel so angry and disgusted with myself for all of the things I've done that I can clearly see now we're not okay. ..Everyone is telling me how great it is that I'm making changes and moving forward. And I think so too. But I can't help but feel so pissed off with myself too. How could I let things get so bad?!..I guess I just needed to vent but I'm also wondering if anyone else has had these feelings and how they dealt with them.

We can't change the past-try to make only good Karma for the rest of your time-that is my challenge to myself. I think of it often. Good wishes.
" but I'm also wondering if anyone else has had these feelings and how they dealt with them " ..I beat myself up for so long. Through several past attempts at getting clean. It's rough but at some point you have to use that negative as fuel for the positive. You can't worry yourself to death over those past mistakes. Remember them learn from them and keep doing what youre doing! I wont drink with you today!..
