Dude hey you're so not alone. Happened more times than I care to mention but as the saying goes nothing worth having in life is going to be easy. .So  go easy on yourself this shit is fucking hard - ut saddle up and get right back on that horse. Unfortunately in my experience the longer the binge lasts the shittier I feel and the harder it is to then stop that steaming train (why? because fuck it that's why)..Rooting for you over here. 
Not today but sure. Who hasn't talked themselves into "just once" or even better "I'll moderate!" Not drinking today is the hardest straightforward thing I've done. You can do this.
I have relapsed several times myself. This time I plan to make it stick. I also feel pretty sad today because I've let myself down and I'm starting over. We can do this! Let's both be kind to ourselves and push on. We got this. 
stop now. don't let the binge progress - THAT would be letting yourself down (a hole)
