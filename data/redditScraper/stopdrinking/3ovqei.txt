Was the best thing that happened to me so far. I went through a treatment facility AA got a sponsor a therapist everything. But still I relapsed and it only took two days and I lost my job wife kicked me out the works. Beat myself up for about a week. Then I realized I did it for the wrong reasons. Not for myself but for how people saw me. It really opened my eyes. I am now spending every chance I get spending quality time with my family. Not just being there quality time. Savoring every moment . I know what I am looking for in work.  Without  my mistake I would have been doing the same thing just existing. It really was the best thing for me seeing how I can lose everything from that first drink to the span of a couple days. I will not drink today .

Sure you can hide it from people for a little while but in the end it's all about what matters to you.  Booze makes it really hard damn near impossible to see that.  Glad you've got your head in a better place this time around.  I'm a firm believer that you've only got to get up one more time than you're knocked down.  Good luck.
Wow it certainly sounds like you have come quite a long way from where you were. Keep at 'er cos you're doing awesome. Thanks for sharing your words of wisdom :)
What are you doing differently this time? How long had you been sober for - and what precipitated the relapse?
