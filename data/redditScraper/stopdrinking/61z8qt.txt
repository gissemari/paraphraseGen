I am finally starting to feel human after my relapse. I had a dream about drinking last night. This has never happened to me before. I've also never been this desperate to get sober either. In the dream I was being offered to go to happy hour (cause of my last two relapses) and I was weighing over the consequences in my mind. I woke up before a decision was made. ..If I am offered to join for happy hour today or tomorrow which I doubt will happen again because I think my new work mates see I can't stop when I start I am not going to weigh it over mentally because today I took a 24 hour pledge NOT to drink. I am going to an AA meeting tonight. Tomorrow I will take another 24 hours pledge not to drink as well. ..Being new in town and lonely and having no friends here is hard but making an absolute asshole out of myself with my drinking is harder. Forgiving myself is the hardest thing of all. ..I won't drink with you today.

&gt; Being new in town and lonely and having no friends here is hard..&gt; I am going to an AA meeting tonight...I'm really thankful you posted this.  I've been pretty lonely lately myself and I'm thinking of going to a meeting for that reason.  I hope you find some comradery there.  Thanks for this and I won't drink with you today!
I have found some comradery at AA. It just helps me to remember I am not the only person in the world with this problem this shameful secret I am not a terrible person. I have a drinking problem and I am doing everything in my power to solve it. ..I won't drink with you today.  
"Forgiving myself is the hardest thing of all". I'll be damned if that isn't the truest thing I've read today. I'm sending you my support buddy and I'm not drinking with you today!
