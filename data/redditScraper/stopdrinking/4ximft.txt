Hey! ...Just wanted to commemorate my latest milestone with a post. I am writing to remind myself of my achievements over the past 3 months. ...Despite reading similar posts early on I never really believed any of these things would begin to happen to **me**!...I really hope that this encourages and resonates with others at the start of or at any point of their journey!...* **I can think so clearly now** for the first time in many many years I can concentrate for a useful period of time...* **I am getting so much done!** this has only started happening the last couple of weeks but I have soooo much energy motivation and focus. I was just drifting aimlessly before....* **significantly reduced depression and anxiety** I have struggled with these conditions for the last 15 years they kept me stuck trapped hiding from life. I'm now off my anti depressants (not saying this is a goal for everyone but it was the right time for me) and my mood is so much more stable!...* **I look great!** My skin is so much different no flushing clearer. I've lost weight and seem to have lost cellulite/belly fat. All of this might be down to being able to maintain a healthier diet without alcohol fuelled binges but it's all related....* **I DO STUFF** I go out of the house (?!) go to art fairs galleries conventions etc meet up with friends even my old drinking buddies and do stuff that isn't poisoning myself! ...I could go on but these have been the most life changing amazing things so far....If you're struggling right now I just want to say (as I would say to myself in the early days) please don't give up **it's worth it**. As people say here whatever is going on in your life there's nothing that alcohol will make better....xxx your fellow kitty sobernaut ...((edit: thanks for the lovely comments guys got a bit emotions from reading them in a good way!))
