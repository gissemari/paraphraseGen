Hi all ..I was on here many many months ago but I started seeing a guy I really like and he drinks so I stopped my sobriety. I really like him but I don't want to keep drinking. Last night I was struggling with severe anxiety I felt like I was going to puke all day (I wasn't hungover) and I was supposed to meet him later that night so because I'm me I went out and self medicated by drinking a bunch of whiskey very quickly to try to calm my nerves. By the time I went to meet him I was drunk and I don't remember much of anything of the night. Luckily he was with me so he drove us back to my house. But I did fall asleep in my clothes and apparently took my comforter that had been in the dryer out and put it back in the washing machine last night (?) I told him this morning I was sorry I was so drunky and he asked if I was ok and I said yes and asked if I did anything stupid which he said I did not. I'm so worried I came across as a total trainwreck because I definitely feel like one now. I was in school this summer and made straight A's which i am so happy about and school is starting again in a couple weeks I want to keep doing good and I want to be responsible. I don't want to keep doing this to myself. I feel absolutely awful today. Not only am I hungover but I'm feeling extremely vulnerable and worried this dude thinks I'm crazy and will never want to see me again. I hate this and I'm so sick of these things happening. So I'm back and I'm ready to try this again.

Even if there's no second date don't let it upset you too much. Keep it together and stick to soda. Best of luck!
I hear you. That's not a nice place to be in. You sound like you feel cornered trapped and just *wrong*..So that sucks -- I acknowledge that and there is no silver lining that...Now the good news? It doesn't have to be this way the rest of today. It doesn't have to be this way tomorrow. It never needs to be like this ever again...You can stop drinking one day at a time. Think you need a drink anyway? Not today; tomorrow is another day...You fell off...OK get back in the saddle. It's worth it and you *can* do this
