Typically in the past day 2 I would be feeling pretty decent again but they say it only gets worse if you continue. Home alone sick from work today and working from home tomorrow so my head is telling me I should go grab a pint to taper off and feel a little better. Trying to trick me but I'm remembering how much this sucks. Maybe I can get some food in my stomach to feel a little better. My stomach is all in knots. Not gonna drink today.

Thanks for your honesty but you already know that it will get better if you don't pick up the next drink!
It's not your head telling you that but that nasty addiction hobgoblin who squats rent-free in there. Tell that SOB to hit the road. 
Hope you're starting to feel better. Imagine how great you'll feel tomorrow waking up hangover free. Hang in there - you've got this. I will not drink with you today. One day at a time!!!
