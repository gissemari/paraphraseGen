I've been fighting an uphill battle against myself in all of these areas for most of my life and I think my helplessness in controlling my mood/focus/energy issues was a big contributing factor to my drinking and weed smoking. I was and am continually frustrated by what seems like a total inability to control these things despite knowing better following prescribed advice and generally trying to lead a healthy lifestyle...Well I went to a doctor recently and had some tests done. It turns out that my mental issues are all well-documented symptoms of chemical and hormonal imbalances caused by hypothyroidism and its associated autoimmune disorder. ..I'M NOT CRAZY! I'm SICK!..Don't get me wrong - I'm not happy that I'm sick. Hypothyroidism is robbing me of my life. But I'm SO RELIEVED that my mental issues have an *identifiable and treatable physical cause* and I'm not nearly as much of a horrible fucked-up person as I thought. Just a physically ill one. It allows me to take a lot of blame off of myself. Time for some crazy self-care...Of course I never would have had the motivation to do this if I was still drinking and smoking which allowed me to sweep my problems under the rug and helped me feed into the idea that I was struggling with a truckload of demons. If you have a similar laundry list of symptoms go to your doctor and see if you have a thyroid problem. It could change your life.

I am so happy for you that you went to the doctors and that they were able to help you. I also have been through the ringer with doctors had my thyroid checked A LOT but I finally was told yesterday I have Angry Liver. I didn't even know that is was a thing but it involves a lot of mental/emotional things as well. I hope you get to feeling better!...High Five:)
