So the first time I relapsed started with some people drinking whiskey in a game I was playing. And now it's the cause of a very strong and sudden urge after a month in the clear. It might not sound like a weird trigger but I hate whiskey. The first time I'd ever gotten utterly trashed was on a bottle of Jack Daniels. Ever since every whiskey I ever tried had turned my stomach. Now it's kind of hard to get away from alcohol in TV and movies and it never really bothers me but the first time I've seen a glass of whiskey since the time I relapsed has caused a very strong urge...Whiskey of all drinks. Not screw drivers or straight vodka which was my choice of drink when I drank. Whiskey...Sorry I just wanted to talk about that. Thanks for listening...Whiskey on TV or not I will not drink with you today.

Stay strong!.And there is a lot of drinking in movies and shows... definitely been noticing that. Even on the TV show Mom where the main characters I guess are in AA the boyfriend will be sitting on the couch having a beer. Or drinks that look alcoholic in kids movies even...But there is life beyond that..IWNDWYT 
You know I can totally relate to this. I was not a whiskey drinker either (also a vodka person) and one of the strongest urges I had right before I came up to my one year soberversary was wanting to drink like a beer and a shot of whiskey (or 5). It was right before Christmas and a Guinness and a Tullamore Dew or Jamesons neat sounded really really good. I occasionally drank a shot(s) of whiskey like if that was the only booze being offered but I never chose it usually while out. I totally get this. I think maybe there's something about WHISKEY that = DRINKING you know? I dunno. It's like it's the most drinkiest drink you can have or something. lol
