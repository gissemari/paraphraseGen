Potentially triggering also a bragging story...This is been the biggest obstacle thus far in my young new journey in sobriety! I live in a town where St. Patrick's Day is not even arguably the biggest holiday of the year. It is THE holiday. I went to the parade and walked around looking at all the goofy green stuff for sale. With all the revelry going on I was wracking my brain at all the people with cans of beer in their hand. Seemingly everyone had one and it was all I could focus on. As early as 9AM people were beginning to swill and commence the ritual. It was part shock and part envy. $2 drink specials abounded. I almost gave in so many times. What's one can of beer? A Red Bull costs more than the specials today. Do people know I'm not one of them anymore (i.e. that I can't be a normal drinker)? It's St. Patrick's Day dammit! Can I not have one drink on this the Mecca of drinking holidays? I had begun the twisted rationale and reasoning that I know all too well and that which has caused me to reset my badge more times than I wish to admit. I went to the ATM and withdrew cash. I had made up my mind; I was heading to the liquor store for a bottle of Jameson heading home and downing it all. Throw on a good playlist and tune out. It was St. Patrick's Day after all. As long as I drank something Irish it was okay (more twisted thinking)...Except I didn't I went home and told a friend that I was thinking about ending my longest sober streak in years. I was expecting something along the lines of "do it! You've made it this far you can totally do it again after St. Paddy's Day!" Instead I was welcomed with something along the lines of "No. Don't do it. That is more money in your pocket for other fun stuff." It honestly made me tear up. I also read this sub and saw all the wonderful sobernauts who would not be swilling green beer and Irish whiskey and it made me realize I wasn't alone...Admittedly I drank NA beer and smoked cigarettes but I plan to kick those too. All in time. As the old saying goes: "non-alcoholic beer is for non-alcoholics."..I will always say how valuable this subreddit is to me and without you wonderful people all your amazing triumphs and trying struggles I'm confident I wouldn't have made it through the most trying and taxing day of my journey. Thank you all and I hope you have a wonderful weekend.

Awesome job!  I too live in a place where St. Patty's Day is THE holiday.  Road race with thousands of people today parade with 200000 attendees tomorrow.  I'm really not feeling envious of drinkers though... If anything they remind me how gross drinking is because people are pretty much drunk all weekend here wearing stupid fucking green plastic hats and leprechaun outfits and starting fights and pissing behind trees.  No thanks...Again great job on hitting this milestone!
