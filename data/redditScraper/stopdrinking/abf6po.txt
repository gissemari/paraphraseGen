After being diagnosed with Pancreatitis in May I gave up alcohol to save my life. I've cheated a little here and there but have been relapsing for about 5 weeks now. Last night I blacked out and don't remember a concert on my anniversary. I've been throwing up all day. In 2019 I really do want to quit for good. It took until now but I really want it and believe in sobriety this time. I finally truly believe I'm better off without it. Fake it till you make it I guess! Wishing you all a sober 2019!!!
