Hey all. Just had a drink today and made all the usual excuses to myself: I'm on holiday I hold down a good job got my finances in order blah blah blah. I know tomorrow I'm going to feel awful. I broke because of boredom. Thing is I know that I am the best version of myself when I'm not drinking and I want to get back to that. I had a 8 week break which to be frankly honest I only got to because I had a bout of illness that broke the cycle and it completely changed how I felt. I didn't even want to drink and I was scared of drinking again because I didn't want to get back into that old trap. I know I'm hurtling back into it again and I don't know what to do...Also I just want to say thankyou to all the people who contribute to this sub. Reading your messages has really had a huge positive influence on me and kept me sober for a longer time than I have ever managed before. I feel I struggle because I don't have anyone around me that I can rely on to help. Not that I think people should firstly they don't really understand it and I appreciate it and also they have their own lives to lead. I've had friends deliberately put things infront of me when I asked for their help to stop and they laughed so I can't count on them. I hope this post is coherant because right now I'm just pouring out my heart hoping someone knows what I mean...Thanks for reading...If anyone is on the fence about having a drink today I honestly WISH I Did Not Drink With You Today...Stay strong and don't do what I did.

If I were you I would do this. Pour the rest of that drink down the sink. No last sip no downing the rest. Just get rid of it quickly before I can talk myself out of it. Then I would dump any remaining alcohol out too. I would leave my house and do something to distract myself. A walk a movie grocery shopping maybe get a hair cut. Literally anything that isn't drinking. If I couldn't leave I'd start cleaning anything and everything in sight. Most important thing would be to stop the drinking cycle. You can do this!
Congratulations on your 98.2% sober 8 week period!
