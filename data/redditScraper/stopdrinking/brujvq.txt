I had to tell my family I wouldn't be able to make a trip we had planned.  I just can't afford it.  I made some lame excuses like needing to get my car checked out student loans going up blah blah blah... They told me they were proud I was being responsible and living within my limits.  ..The truth is I'm broke because of alcohol.  Every spare cent I had and didn't have went to booze.   They don't know this is something I struggle with and I'm not ready to come clean to them.  ..On any other day this would be an open invitation to drink.  I wouldn't think twice about where the money is coming from or what was being neglected to afford more wine.  Today I'm sitting with these shitty feelings of guilt and shame and hoping I don't go back to where I was.   ..On a positive note I don't wake up wondering how long it will be until I puke my hands are much steadier I'm having planful sleep (bedtime routine complete lights out) and my skin is happier. ..Thanks all for being here and helping me stay accountable.

I thought my family didn't know but they certainly suspected something was amiss. Lying always made me feel worse. My family was proud that I was getting help for my alcoholism.
