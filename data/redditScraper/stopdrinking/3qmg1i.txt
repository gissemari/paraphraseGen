I have been struggling to do it by myself and I simply can't do it alone.  It has been over a decade since I was active in recovery.  I feel a bit of a sense of relief because I finally have given up however mostly I feel pitiful and incomprehensible demoralization.

Good for you.  I hope you update us after your meeting.
great choice!  it took me about 30 days to finally try a mtg and I'm sure glad I did.  Hope it's great for you too
