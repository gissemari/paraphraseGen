Today I should be celebrating my second time having two weeks sober this year which is kind of a huge accomplishment for me. Relapsing after 90ish days was hard to handle and I'm really proud of myself for bouncing back into the double digits. I've been going to meetings being more regimented about my exercise and eating better this time around (basically the things I wasn't doing the first time).  I feel like when I'm in meetings I'm really absorbing the messages and I'm getting to meet people and hopefully finding a sponsor/temporary sponsor soon so I can start working the steps. I'm noticing my feelings this time more and I'm starting to process them write them down analyze them and not just numb them.  Relapses suck but I really feel like I may have discovered how bad my problem was and I feel like I'm doing things right and even though I'm exhausted and still trying to figure things out I proud of myself for working hard. It's not perfect but I'm learning not to have expectations. I'm even working on getting a therapist again (which I guess I didn't realize can be a process akin to a weird form of dating). All good stuff...And then I went to my intensive outpatient program (IOP) session tonight...Don't get me wrong my evening IOP was really helpful to me when I got sober the first time. But as the initial 5-night a week sessions tapered off I noticed myself getting less out of them. Even before I relapsed I was at the point where I was mostly going because the psychiatrist there gives me my Naltrexone and Antabuse and since I'm between psychiatrists right now I think its important to stay involved to get the meds. When I take them they help. Since my relapse I've been bumped back up to 3 nights of IOP a week which has been incredibly hard given that the location is extremely inconvenient to my work (where my schedule has become more involved) and home (not to mention the fact it's cutting into my ability to get out to more AA/SMART meetings gym time and other habits that are going to be more sustainable long term). In fact this week I let one of my counselors know I wanted to switch to a more convenient location in hopes of continuing the program but also my out-of-IOP recovery work. Tonight when I got there late of course because of work one of my counselors pulled me aside to let me know I had two urine screens test positive in the past two weeks. She didn't indicate what it was but asked if I'd been drinking. I said no and offered the piles of evidence to the contrary. I was breathalyzed urine screened and sent away without being told anything else. When I asked she pretty callously said she couldn't get the results out tonight and that she'd tell me in IOP on Monday. ..At this point I'm devastated. I stay around to wait to speak to another counselor about the location transfer and when the second counselor realizes how visibly upset I am I tell her about the positive screens. The only thing I can think of is that one of my other medications may be responsible. After my first detox I was given a prescription for Hydroxyzine (or Atarax) an antihistamine now commonly used for anxiety and sleep (especially for people detoxing or people with addiction issues). The prescription states "For use as needed for anxiety" and given a few anxiety-provoking events post-relapse I chose to use it twice both around the times of the positive test results. Somehow unlike the first counselor (who clearly wanted nothing to do with me) the second counselor was willing to pull up the test results to reveal I had tested positive for benzos twice and EtG (an alcohol byproduct) once. After some searching and reaching out to some folks familiar with the medication Hydroxyzine can cause false positives for benzos. ..I can't explain the EtG result at all and I'm assuming that's some form of false positive or something I consumed accidentally (hell I've been on Antabuse and after relapsing 4 or so days after stopping taking it I still had a minor reaction so trust me had I been drinking during the time they suspected I was drinking I'm sure I would've been more sick). I've never ever in the entirety of my life taken a prescription drug that wasn't prescribed to me.  More importantly I've never lied to this program. Ever. I was upfront about my medications when I was first processed I was honest when I relapsed and also reminded them of all of my medications and before the first positive test I even approached their clinical director and staff psychiatrist to remind them because I was concerned that the Hydroxyzine could be an issue (they told me it wouldn't be). Also I've had no reason to lie. I'm there completely voluntarily because I want to get better. Now they've been sitting on the two positive tests for weeks/days without notifying me and I have a feeling they were going to blindside me with them in front of an entire IOP group on Monday had I not asked for more clarification tonight allowing me to wait completely anxiously over the weekend and basically be publicly shamed for the results...I feel really hurt right now. This week has been a struggle and tonight made me miserable because I feel like I'm getting in trouble despite doing nothing wrong. I feel disrespected and I feel like I've lost trust in a program that I thought was helping me. Knowing that my family is fully behind me and believes me has been encouraging but it still feels like people see me as an addict that can't be trusted and it's hard. I've been more honest in the past few months than most of the rest of the past few years. It's demoralizing. Furthermore these people are supposed to be experts in addiction and not only have I had to remind them on multiple occasions about my medication history they not only didn't seem to know I was even prescribed Hydroxyzine or what purpose it served. ..I'm dreading having to go back on Monday not just because I'm embarrassed but because I want to confront the counselor who basically treated me like shit tonight and tell her how I feel. I'm considering quitting the IOP program altogether and finding a new one (I'm lucky to have several options locally) even though going through the intake process and getting used to an entire new IOP seems daunting. But for now I'll keep up with my meetings my exercise my reading my research my journaling and know in my heart that I know I haven't had a drink or drug in the past two weeks. And that's something to celebrate...If you made it through that sorry for the long rant. I didn't drink tonight. And I will not drink with you tonight. Have a blessed evening y'all.

I'm sorry this happened - how frustrating. Like you said - you know in your heart you've been clean and sober and that's absolutely what matters most   IWNDWYT 
Sometimes we need to make changes or mix things up to continue in our sobriety. Sometimes we make rash decisions in the heat of the moment. I would encourage you to think carefully and several times between now and Monday about changing programs...&gt; I've been more honest in the past few months than most of the rest of the past few years...This is a really hard thing to accept. **We** know how significantly our behavior is changing. **We** know how different it feels this time. But other people? All they see are our actions and often not our current actions but all the accumulated history of our behavior. In the case of your IOP counselors they may not see *you* but all their past cases. This is in no way meant to justify that behavior. It is meant to remind you that all we can do is try and choose how **we** react to others not how we think they should act.
