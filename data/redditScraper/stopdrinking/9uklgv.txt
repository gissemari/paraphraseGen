Made it almost 2 months. Ended up getting a bottle Saturday night. Was struggling and not happy and finally gave in. Things were great at first when I quit drinking after a few days of withdrawals and the horrible nightmares I had nightly for the first 20 days or so. Felt better had more energy happy everything better. Then for the past 2 weeks I was in this this unhappy mood i just couldn't shake.  Shifting between that and anger about anything pretty much. Back and forth.  I was miserable and I really don't know why.  That has been the same kind of thing that has happened in past when I tried to stop drinking.  I get into that disposition and then start drinking again. I mean is that my normal self now?  Did I mess up my mind after all the years of drinking where now that's all I can feel is nothing unhappiness and anger?  Can anyone relate to this?  If so did you get through it and how?  I can't stand the thought that that's how it's going to feel all the time in long sobriety.

I think it's the chemicals rebalancing and the ticket be leaving the body.  Plus apparently my brain had been using alcohol as a source of food so it had to get used to using whatever it was actually supposed to be using for energy and fuel.  I didn't feel all that shit hot.  But I kept a positive attitude and I had pretty decent days and good things to focus on in the meantime.  I took my vitamins and stayed hydrated.  I did my best with what I had.  It really did take a few months to sort out the moods and whatnot on the whole but in reality I still felt better than when I was drinking.  How can you beat not waking up hungover ever?  I mean that just takes the cake.  
I just whiffed in the face of a similar dynamic after 45 days. Off track for three days back on track now.  
Look into paws I kept relapsing at two months before I researched that
