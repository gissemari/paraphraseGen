Good morning afternoon evening Sobernauts! I'm running late as usual    but better late than never...**Theme:** Light bulb moment..**Quote:** "Strength and growth come only through continuous effort and struggle." - [ Napoleon Hill](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes_of_the_day.html)...**What it means to me:** Basically sums up my entire sober journey  getting through my divorce and well-  pretty much my entire life. For example I don't stare down every liquor store I drive past hunker down on the wine aisle when grocery shopping - thinking "what if" or cringe to everything that reminds me of my ex.  I had to make an effort to not drink distract myself find what *truely* made me happy keep moving on &  I know you know *the struggle is real* my fellow sobernauts. I am now stronger than I was years ago day one & yesterday because everyday little by little I've grown...Bonus quote from rehab round one that I have managed to hang onto: "If we don't change we don't grow if we don't grow we really aren't living." - [Anatole France](https://goo.gl/images/JxhvWs)...High five!
