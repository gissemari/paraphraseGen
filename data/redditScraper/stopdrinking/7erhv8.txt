I had a reset after about a month! Before I was drinking daily and dealing with fatigue bad acid reflux in my throat and ribs weight gain and a massive attitude problem. Plus that stressful stalker who  triggers this shit. For one month I slept great had no pain had energy and was able to ignore my stalker and think clearly to keep that problem under control...Well I relapsed the other day and EVERYTHING CAME BACK TEN FOLD. I got drunk. Freaked over my stalker. Woke up the next morning with nasty acid reflux and an awful mood. I couldn't concentrate at all. And now I'm STILL itching all over while I detox. My swollen eye even showed up again. I don't know if this is some kind of kindling but it sucks. Don't quit and go back to it. Hell is waiting right there for you. Now if my ribs would loosen up and I could stop itching...that would be great. Plus I have to go through the week-one mood swings again.

Thank you for posting this I really needed a reminder this week.  I have a family history of kidney disease so I need to stay sober and stay off the PPIs which I'll have to go right back on again if I pick up the bottle.
"Don't quit and go back to it. Hell is waiting right there for you." - i believe it.
Thanks for the reminder. 
Thank you for sharing this. I'm having a really hard time today and feel like I'm planning a relapse in my head. Today it feels like so much work to stay sober. Iwndwyt. Not today. 
Welcome back. Good to have you here. IWNDWYT
