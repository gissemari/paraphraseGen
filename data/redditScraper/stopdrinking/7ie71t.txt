I've been sober for just over a year now and about once a week I dream about drinking. I just woke up feeling disappointed because last night I dreamt that I relapsed. ..I feel good now after fully waking up and realizing it was just a dream. I'm thankful for these powerful reminders of what could be if I do choose to drink.

I have then we all do I have been told they go away in time. It weird to wake up thinking man I fucked up only to realize it was just a dream....IWNDWYTD!
I recently had my drinking dream of my whole life.  Never had one before.  I wasn't the person drinking in the dream but it was about drinking nonetheless.  Congrats on that wonderful relief that comes with realizing "it's just a dream."
