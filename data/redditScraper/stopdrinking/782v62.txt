I did it! I got here! ..From the night screaming and crying on the phone to samaritans...From the anxiety fuelled fights with my boyfriend...From almost relapsing on my eating disorders...From spending all my money and falling into debt...To now 6 months no drinking. Building up savings. No relapsing on my eating disorder. ..I have a new dog. I still have my boyfriend. I don't drink. ..I'm happy and I will not drink with you today..Thanks for all the support...Edit: Oh and I am training to take part in a half marathon next year to support Samaritans in thanks and already raised over a  100 in one week - yaaay!
