I've never ever managed to get more than a week without drinking in my life before  (25 started 17). After discovering this sub I'm on day 9 and feeling motivated as hell. I know that motivation won't  last forever but I'll be able to find solidarity in my struggles here. Thank-you r/stopdrinking !

Sobriety is a journey and it's a decision we make every day. It's not easy but it's worth it. I will not drink with you tonight.
