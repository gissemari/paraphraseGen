I'm a distance runner and I have several "pick 'em up put 'em down" "relentless forward progress" "one foot in front of the other" etc. I also do mindfulness meditation and have several that I use there "Be here now" "just breathe" etc...I don't think mantras are mind control but they are mind focussing. They aren't laden with some message that you aren't aware of they aren't nefarious or insidious they are what they say... it's not like someone some how backmasked a phrase. ..Even though I'm not an AA person I find "one day at a time" helpul and even before getting sober I used to use "it works if you work it" as my mantra when I was doing P90X...Words have power....  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|33|3|PJMurphy|*On moderation: I *don't* want to drink like a normal person* by urbanrunnner|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/26u2yz/on_moderation_i_dont_want_to_drink_like_a_normal/chujgl3)|.I wish I could drink like a normal person.

That's a strange way to put it. .Why should AA be the default option?..AA only works for some people and it didn't work for me. I spent almost two decades going in and out of the meetings - at one point I went to a meeting every day for two years. AA could only help me become a 'recovering alcoholic' but I wanted to be a 'recovered alcoholic'. ..There can be this assumption that people ought to give AA a try and if they don't they are not serious about recovery. This makes no sense to me. Does everyone who is serious about recovery need to try cognitive-behavioral therapy or Christian rehab? It's a bit like me saying 'you are not serious about recovery unless you try my magical moon juice'. ...  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|22|3|coolcrosby|*3 weeks sober but wife still won't trust me..* by orange1690|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/26m0xw/3_weeks_sober_but_wife_still_wont_trust_me/chs9rra)|.> If she won't trust me in this I will eventually fall of the wagon...No wonder she doesn't trust you.  ..You don't change minds with words and promises.  You change minds with consistent sober daily actions.  I changed minds by going to AA meetings listening beginning to practice the principles that I learned and by not making my sobriety CONTINGENT on anyone else's feelings beliefs or actions.  ..Good luck....  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|21|0|NotThisTimeDave|*I don't drink but my dad died last year from drinking and I never had the chance to ask him to stop.

I don't need a personal trainer.  I know what I have to do at the gym and I do it.  I'm happy with my results.  Most people who go to the gym don't have a personal trainer.  ..Your question makes it seem like you believe that it's impossible to be happily sober without AA. Is that what you think?  ...  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|20|3|Nika65|*I didn't wake up in a ditch today* by withasmackofham|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/26pt20/i_didnt_wake_up_in_a_ditch_today/chtbnul)|.>if I continue down this path of adjusting my definition of alcoholism to exclude myself from it...That is a very common occurence with us alcoholics...Welcome Ethan.

But in analyzing any good conspiracy you have to figure out who stands to gain. Follow the money. In the case of AA it doesn't make for a very exciting conspiracy. Nobody is at the top. I'm personally guilty of exploiting your addiction as a means to conquer my own and the way I do it is by trying to help you get sober. Scandalous. ..That said I've totally left some meetings alone because they had a more culty vibe than I wanted. I'm fortunate to live in a big city with literally thousands of options. I've come to no longer hate on those meetings I'm glad that they are there for the people that they work for. The groups I attend are the ones that work for me and I love them. I think its crucial to check out all the options available to you. ..Last point- if you are just hitting the meeting and not making outside connections then you're likely missing the best stuff. Talking to good people outside of the context of a meeting is where I've had the most enlightening conversations regarding issues such as these.  As they say "the fellowship is golden!" ;) ...  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|19|2|SOmuch2learn|*I miss drinking.* by zeeginganinja|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/26m4ld/i_miss_drinking/chsb27o)|.Thanks for your post. You are not alone but.....Drinking is of course always an option. Think about why you stopped in the first place. Drinking will get you back to that in a heartbeat. Is that what you want? And how will drinking help your career relationships and student loan debt? Do you see the insanity of your thinking? Find some things to do. Journal. Go for hikes. Explore the country you are visiting. It sounds like you need more support. I couldn't do it alone. With the help of a therapist and involvement in AA I maintained sobriety. ..It's ok to miss drinking. It is normal. Luckily you are protected by the culture right now. Stop romanticizing drinking so your thinking is realistic before you have access to alcohol. Browse the subreddit and keep posting. It helps to share how you're feeling. Read recovery literature; see Alan Carr's book near the bottom of the sidebar. ..Take action and your thinking will change. ....  ..  ..---.^this ^report ^was ^automatically ^generated. ^contact ^/u/offtherocks ^with ^problems.
