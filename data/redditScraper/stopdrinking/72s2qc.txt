It feels good to share the burden doesn't it? I always had a feeling that I didn't want to burden people people with my problems. For those that understand it is not a burden and it actually helps to listen and be there for others. 
Awesome!  Inspired by your introspection and choices!
I have been there with the text: PING! and then too scared to read it. I hope it goes well. You are making the right choice for your life and your health.
I am glad you told somebody rude. You don't have to walk alone. And of course you always have us! Looking foward to update!!
How did it go?
I came clean to my GF and told her all the dirty drinking secrets I held. I also told my close friends and family of my alcoholism. I felt it was needed to keep myself honest during my recovery. 
&gt;I will keep you updated on this...so??
