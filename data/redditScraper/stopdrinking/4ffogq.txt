I had cravings at the end of my shift today. I've been dealing with a lot of anxiety lately and a general feeling of not being "good enough" which is actually shit I've always dealt with but when I was self medicating with alcohol I was pretty numb to those feelings. 2 weeks into sobriety I feel like kind of a mess. I keep trying to focus on doing things to lift my mood in my free time. Mainly being outside with my dog. I've also however been extremely tired and craving sweets and junk food...So I got home tonight after a stressful day (nothing in particular just feeling the anxiety and fatigue and all that fun stuff) and made supper then decided to take my dog for a run. My boyfriend and his son had already gotten home and were finishing dinner when I got back. I hadn't been on a run in probably a year or so and I was really tired when I got home but my craving was gone (yay!) so I went to take a hot bath. I was feeling better and sat down on our bed to chill out and recoup from the run. ..My boyfriend came into the bedroom fussing about how much laundry was in the hamper. He has been out of town for National Guard since last Thursday (big cravings there too. I loved my alone time drinking.) and expected the house and laundry to be in perfect shape when he got back. Admittedly I neglected the laundry a little bit. I was working all weekend and honestly was too tired to bother. It's not THAT much. Just one full hamper would probably take me one morning or evening to do. Anyways I guess I should have just brushed it off but a huge argument ensued and now I feel absolutely shitty. I've been struggling almost daily to not pick up a bottle of wine but resisting. I tried to explain how hard these past few days have been to my boyfriend and he told me I need to either "get a grip" or go to the doctor for medication which I will do if I need to but I want to see if my emotions will level out on their own first with a few more weeks of sobriety. Has anybody has similar issues with your SO when you first quit drinking? My main priority right now is to do whatever I can to prevent myself from drinking again and I don't necessarily think it's a bad thing to let the laundry and housework go a little bit. Keep in mind that ..Everything seems overwhelming. I don't even have that much to stress out about right now and it feels like too much. I've been using alcohol as my main stress reliever for years. Now it's gone and I have to find other ways to deal I guess. Going for a run felt pretty good my muscles feel pleasantly tired and sore. Having 2 weeks sober feels good too but I think the extra clarity has just made me realize how much work I have ahead of me. Posting here is super therapeutic for me in itself so thank you to anyone who has read this and please let me know if I'm not the only one who is an emotional tired hungry mess in early sobriety! Random sidenote: I am addicted to lime Lacroix and is the grapefruit really the best flavor? If so I am definitely going to have to ask my grocery store to order some for me..

I had some pretty intense mood swings for he first two weeks especially right around the 2 week mark. I totally slacked on a bucnh of chores for the first two weeks. I just didn't feel up for anything. I remember at day 17 I felt noticeably more calm less irritable and really clearheaded. I began working more (I work from home and had been slacking in that dept too) Now I'm on week 3 and I feel even better! Going for a run or walk in the sunshine really helped too. Sounds to me like you're doing really well keep going!
A doctor once described the effect of quitting drinking to me as being like pulling a blanket off the brain-- everything that had been muffled suddenly fires up. I certainly had a lot of extra-intense everything the first couple of months or so. My pet name for the process is "the spin cycle." ..It took me longer than you to discover that physical activity helps quite a bit.
