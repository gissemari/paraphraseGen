#preach ..Not drinking with you today 
Thanks for the chuckle. 
This really made me laugh! So true :) Never read a story about someone relapsing having a wonderful night and realising they can moderate after all. Then living happily ever after. 
Thank you for posting this I was actually thinking of this yesterday.  My addict brain went "Hey man it's ok to relapse!!  Come on plenty of people succeed and have a great time."..*crickets*
YUP!..I briefly thought it would be a rad idea to tag the relapse posts so that I can just read a concentrated amount of them when I have cravings.......but maybe that's not a thing to call attention to.  :P 
AMEN!!!
