Still a struggle but better. Had to fill out a questionnaire and got to circle no on the do you drink question for the first time ever.  I circled it 3 times. I'm calm my cool is coming back and I don't reek of alcohol. A little worried about these hot summer nights but cold lemonade sounds good too. My new mantra is day by day choose the sober way.

&gt;got to circle no on the do you drink question for the first time ever...I remember the first time I got to put that down it's pretty awesome isn't it! No drink-maths-fudging required :)..I keep my pantry stocked with sparkling water I've got some sparkling grapefruit in for a special treat :)
