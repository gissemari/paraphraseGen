This is a first for me but I made a sandwich and got a big glass of water instead of a beer. Just thought that this might help someone else out there struggling with the late night.

Good job getting the sandwich. Food helps a lot. Depending on how long you've been drinking your blood sugar might be pretty screwed up so snacking is going to be a great way to get over cravings. Sugar is also good for this...You can probably write off doing very much sleeping for a while. I don't think I slept for the first 36 hours after I quit though it probably just felt that way. The plus side is that what sleep you do get will be solid as hell so you'll be ok...While you're still up why not go check out the chat room? Or read through archives. There's a lot of great information for you to peruse there. Either way keep up the good work. Don't forget why you're doing this. Be well.
Damn I want a sandwich now :P Good job!
Yep.  Insomnia sucks.  Congrats on the sandwich.
Instead of looking at the computer or even reading you may want to learn about relaxation techniques. Carbs Before bed can help aid sleep but also add to your waistline :)
Bad sleeping is very common especially in the early days.  Keep in your thoughts that it will get better.  I went through sleepless days too but now almost always sleep like a rock.  If I do have trouble sleeping I go for some Sleepy Time tea (actually Trader Joe's equivalent) or some other relaxing tea like chamomile.
