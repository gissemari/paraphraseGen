Hi all..I relapsed last week and while I only drank on one night I drank pretty heavily. I felt like *garbage* the next day. Physically I felt much less sick on the second day but mentally and emotionally I felt depressed drained and anxious all at once. I feel like I'm just now getting back to normal (well normal for me anyway) - and it's been a week. ..Has anyone else experienced this? It's absolutely an experience to keep in mind to help  play the tape forward' and prevent future relapses. I remember feeling extreme depression right after I first quit drinking a month and a half ago and it eventually subsided. This feels similar but seems to have been triggered by a night of heavy drinking (as opposed to the years of consistent drinking I'd fallen into before.)..Tl;dr are emotional after-effects (beyond guilt remorse shame etc.) common following a relapse? How long did they last for you? Mental health issues are scary and I want to know that I'm not alone.

I don't know if it's common after a relapse but I felt that way every morning after I drank. Since quitting I'm realizing how much of my self loathing was really just pure liquid discouragement.
I had a relapse last weekend after 75 days and this may be the most depressed I've ever felt. 
Yes if you look up "kindling" you'll find more information. You're probably feeling some PAWS -- Post-Acute Withdrawal Syndrome. The good news is that if you stay quit it will eventually get better. I won't drink with you today!
