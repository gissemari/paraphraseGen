I've just realized that I'm entering the dating game again and for the first time in a decade it will be sober. I haven't been in a relationship or dated without drinking in 10 years..and honestly that thought scares me. I know that alcohol is a problem for me that's why I'm here. But that doesn't mean that genuinely good experiences and moments didn't happen with it. I miss playing strip poker with my ex we would brave the winter in my apartment listening to music playing fun drinking games kissing sitting in the car smoking and having a few while guessing the music that was playing. Sitting out on the deck drinking margaritas and talking about what we wanted from life and each other...but she's gone and I'm a drunk...I suppose that is the trade off though sacrifice the small good to get away from the crippling pain it brings..  I'm in tears thinking about it maybe I'm just missing her. Today or really this week has been a struggle. My brain clicks to having a drink before I even realize it's not going to happen.  ..I haven't entered a relationship sober since I dated my high school sweetheart who I went on to be engaged to 3 years later.. fast forward 10 years and I'm facing down the paralyzing fear that some of the most intimate and happiest moments of my life are over and gone perhaps forever. But just remembering some of the small things the fun had while drinking.. it hurts to know I let it get this far. Idk. It's a hard Friday night...

I am sorry you are having a rough Friday night. I believe that the right person will be someone who respects sobriety. IWNDWYT. Hugs.  
The world is in constant change this last year has been the biggest change for me in 30 years we just finalized our divorce back on the 12th. I have come to accept the fact that just because I want something or someone dose not mean I will get it \ them. It's a struggle as we go on the sober road I like the fact that I will remember  all of my next serious relationship. I hope I can be a better partner next time I do believe if I remain sober these will come true. IWNDWYTD!
