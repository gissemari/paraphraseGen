I relapsed after only one pathetic month of sobriety. Of course it started out small   I'll just have a couple of drinks   then I inevitably moved onto 250ml of Kentucky bourbon about every other day. I tell myself I can't help it this is just the way I am. I barely even have the desire to stop anymore. I'm only 24 I don't wanna die like this. The despair feels endless unless I'm drunk. But I will not be drinking today.

A whole month ain't nothing to laugh at. Focus on the days you didn't drink rather than the relapse. Focusing on the bad things only leads to drinking off the bad things. Develop a "who cares" attitude about mistakes and think forward.
I haven't managed to make it to "one pathetic month" yet. I'm on my third badge reset. clearly you've shown the strength and ability to do better than many of us here. You've got this  
That month wasn't pathetic it was one huge step in the right direction.  One slip doesn't have to mean sliding all the way back.  You did one month that means you can do one month and one day.  ..Godspeed and IWNDWYT
You came to the right place.  Hey the key is you are back.  24 is young.  Don't despair.  You did thirty days so that is a good start. The key is to have some tools ready and anticipate the crave.  Smart Recovery has a lot of free literature under the resource tab.  I went to an online meeting tonight. They discuss different tools and strategies.  One of them is DEADS: Delay escape avoid distract substitute.  IWNDWYT
