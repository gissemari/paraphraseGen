...is that I have amazing friends...Today one of my best oldest friends sent me a message to ask me how I was doing.  I almost replied that I was fine.  Instead I told the truth - that I was really struggling yesterday and today.  That last night I'd pictured grabbing a glass grabbing a bottle and drinking.  I white knuckled through it.  I told her that some days I feel great and some days I feel nothing but shame.  ..I talked to her about all the lies I'd told about my drinking all the things I'd done to try to hide it.  Because I knew back then if I'd told her the truth she would have tried to stop me and I didn't want to stop yet.  I told her sometimes the idea of telling other people what I've done hangs like a terrible specter over my head...She listened and she told me how she felt - about all of that and how she feels now.  She shared some of her own struggles with  me how hard it is sometimes to deal with anxiety or depression. ..I feel a lot better now.  Sometimes I forget that if I'm just willing to talk about what's bothering me I know some wonderful people who are happy to shine a little light on it.

Thanks for reminding me that we're only as sick as our secrets.
