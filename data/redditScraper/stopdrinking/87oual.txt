I am not sure what my badge says. I know there was obviously a reset that was needed two years ago. ..BUT I have two years today. If you asked me what I was going to accomplish in two years time I would have severely underestimated myself. My career is thriving I married my best friend we closed on a house in August and we're expecting a little boy this week. (*fingers crossed he doesn't make us wait much longer*) ..I had some time before &amp; relapsed because I got complacent and thought I knew better. I feel hard and fast. ..This time around I embraced recovery. I am apart of narcotics anonymous. I love the friendships I have made. I have a great sense of self. I have a genuine appreciation for life today. I hope with the help of my higher power I continue this path I am on. ..Thank you everyone for being here. The ones before me &amp; those of you after me. There is only one way this is done no matter how many days we have and that is one day at a time.
