I had 125 days and I drank starting two Mondays ago. 125 days is a very long time for me. I've been drunk 4 nights and 2 days since that time. Sunday night into Tuesday afternoon is a blur (because I was still drunk from drinking all day Monday) and I cancelled an appointment Tuesday morning with a lie. I feel awful remembering all the dishonesty of drinking come creeping back. It's not as bad as it was last May but it's pretty bad. I'm terrified and feel way out of sorts. The old dark thoughts are creeping back. I'm hoping this is the low point of stopping this relapse. Not drinking with you all today.

Welcome back. You didn't lose those days and you didn't lose the clarity they brought you. Hop back on. Hugs. &lt;3
A slip is just that you did the right thing by posting here. Don't beat yourself up! If you were running a marathon and tripped and fell no one would make you go all the way back to the starting line. You just pick yourself up and keep going. IWNDWYT 
Glad you came back which means your still on the road. Forgive yourself and move forward. Stay strong my friend we are all here to help one another.     I will not drink with you today. :)
The guilt and shitty feelings will pass once you get some days under your belt again. Get yourself back up try to learn something and let's finish what we started!
Welcome back! 4 months is awesome you still have all that time.  I am amazed every day I manage not to drink and I'm glad that you were able to stop and keep fighting.  You have so much worth and I hope you show yourself the same kindness and support you would to another alcoholic who relapsed
