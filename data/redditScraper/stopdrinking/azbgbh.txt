I just recently crossed the one year mark.  One year was something I wanted to achieve since 2013.  Now that's over now what?  Unfortunately my brain is saying to me louder than it has in a while "recovery is OVER you can go back to normal now!"  But my drinking was never normal.  Its been a story of DUIs lost jobs countless blackouts and hangovers withdraw symptoms hospitalizations and counselors.  And through all those consequences the idea that I could control and enjoy my drinking kept coming back around and my history shows that it wont work.  I'll end up pacing the bedroom debating whether to get more driving to the store before it closes at 2AM buying more than I need and waking up on the floor or worse...&amp;#x200B;..I got a year by learning first and foremost to tell on myself so I'm doing it here first.  I've also learned I should reach out to others daily and that mental exercises which keep me focused on patience and gratitude get me though any situation.  I've learned to live a day at a time and that is what I'll have to do tomorrow as well.   There's no reason for me to consider myself "cured" by a trip around the sun but the thought of taking a drink comes in strong each day.   There are too many things I am able to do today which I would sit on the bar stool and daydream about for years so I hope posting this helps.  Thank you all.

Hi I stopped by to tell you that you're not alone. I felt this same exact way almost as if something was "finished" or "ended." But all your memories of what will happen if you have a drink again are correct and you know it. It just sucks and the realization of that is finally settling in for a nice extended stay at least that's the way it felt to me. Keep walkin. One of my favorite expressions I saw going around a while back was this: "Don't look back. You're not going that way." ..Congrats on a year you did something huge and important and this shit is HARD. I'm right there with you. But I have a feeling things are going to expand even more. I really do. Hugs.
