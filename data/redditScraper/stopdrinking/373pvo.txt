I am excited that I have hit 2 months without a speed bump. For the past few years I have been struggling to get a week sober. Every Friday it seems I would relax. Relapsing made my anxiety depression and shame out of control. Furthermore I was destroying my marriage...I know that it has been said here time and time again but it has been true for me that I could not get sober for anyone except myself. My spouse would beg me to stop drinking so I started hiding it. It wasn't until I wanted sobriety for me that I was able to stop...Everyone's timeline looks different. Meaning we experience different things at different times. What I can say for myself is that I have a lot more serenity than I did two months ago. The universe still throws crap my way but I can deal with it better sober...The SD chat room and subreddit have been a big part of my sobriety. Thank you all!..Sally on chat
