Went out last night with another married couple who knew about my not drinking and so no one drank - yay! Dinner went fine then we went bowling and of course it's one of those fancy bowling places with a server and the people across us were drinking and there were drink commercials (during football games) and drink specials on all the screens flashing away in my face. I tried to stay calm but it really bothered me. I kept my cool though we played 3 games and headed home...On the way home I just couldn't stop thinking about drinking. It was the first time I can even remember going bowling sober (usually we would go bowling after visiting a brewery or something) so that was probably why. Talking to my husband about it he understood my frustrations and it keeps coming up that I'm trying to do this for 30 days...he thinks I can go back to drinking at some point but I'm not so confident in myself...Tonight is a game night/watching The Walking Dead night that we've been doing with our friends for a few weeks now. Normally everyone has at least 2 drinks. I'm starting to feel nervous and like I want to give in but there will be people there that know I'm trying to quit for 30 days so I'd be very embarrassed if I drank. That idea is not enough to overcome the craving though. ..I know some of you will tell me to just not go but it makes me really sad to not see my friends as much as I used to. I know there will be at least 1 other person there not drinking but we aren't that close. ..Anyway that's my day 6 rant. *sigh*

I had to make not-drinking a priority in the early days. You don't have to cut yourself off completely from your friends but if you're wavering now I'd personally not go. You might feel lots better and more secure next week.
