Hello all..Just checking in to share a milestone of 40 days of living a more positive healthier life.  For 40 days I have had my eyes and my options open.  I am living life on my terms.  No more excuses no more deception no more lies.....I can't help but think about this experience overall and draw parallels in my mind to a personal favorite movie of mine (Although I know a lot of people thought it was a horrible movie...).  I think about the movie The Matrix...**When I first started thinking about stopping drinking:**..Trinity: I know why you're here Neo. I know what you've been doing... why you hardly sleep why you live alone and why night after night you sit by your computer. You're looking for him. I know because I was once looking for the same thing. And when he found me he told me I wasn't really looking for him. I was looking for an answer. It's the question that drives us Neo. It's the question that brought you here. You know the question just as I did...Neo: What is the Matrix?..Trinity: The answer is out there Neo. It's looking for you and it will find you if you want it to...**When I was making a list of Positives/Negatives of drinking:**..Morpheus: This is your last chance. After this there is no turning back. You take the blue pill \- the story ends you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill \- you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit\-hole goes...**Early posts and discussions with people on this sub:**..Morpheus: I'm trying to free your mind Neo. But I can only show you the door. You're the one that has to walk through it...**Fighting triggers and temptation to relapse:**..Cypher: You know I know this steak doesn't exist. I know that when I put it in my mouth the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy and delicious. After nine years you know what I realize?..\[Takes a bite of steak\]..Cypher: Ignorance is bliss..There are tons more.  Watch it and think about the addiction of alcohol as the matrix it's interesting...  IWNDWYT!
