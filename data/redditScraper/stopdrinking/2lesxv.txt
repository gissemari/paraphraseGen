I wanted to tell this story to my friends but have realized I don't have anyone in my life that would laugh at this story. And that's because it's not funny not when I've been struggling with this for years...Last night I had 6 'tall boys' spent time with my girlfriend and went to bed. I woke up and actually did get a good amount of sleep. I woke up kind of hung over so I started drinking a few glasses of water. I got to work and started working (computer programmer allows me to sit at a desk unnoticed) with green tea in hand. Then I was feeling warm and started getting that wet mouth feeling. I end up leaving the office and throwing up in the bathroom and the outside four times. I got back into the office and got through the rest of my day. I struggled through an online quiz for school struggled through producing code and am now in class unable to pay attention long enough to learn...All I can think about is how I just need a beer to sober up. I have as I said struggled with this for years. I have went to AA for awhile but the group I meet with is when my Thursday night class is. I've tried other groups but just cannot find another one I 'like'. ..I was doing well when going to AA and then school started and I said it'd be ok to have beer on the weekends that's what college kids do right? They can do it so I can do it too! Slowly but surely I didn't care about the rule and went from One 24 oz can a day to a 6 pack almost daily. ..I'm going into my last month and a half of college and now more than ever need to straighten up and flight right. One day at a time! Here we go again!..I should also mention yesterday my DUI was finalized in Civil Court which is why I drank the 6 pack. Kind of adds more importance to the story...

You never have to feel like this again.
Hi there. Do you want to stop? It doesn't have to be so terrible.
