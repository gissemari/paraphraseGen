Made it to 9 days (a big deal for me) and when I got invited to drink margaritas last night I said yes. Didn't even think twice. So had 2 margaritas and was like okay not so bad. It felt nice to socialize. I thought maybe I can moderate. But then on the way home I stopped at the store. Picked up more alcohol. I didn't want the buzz to stop. Woke up hungover and anxious and disappointed. And now I remember why I cannot moderate...Anyways I will not drink with you guys today. Got a wine glass with sparkling water and some chocolate. One day at a time.

Can't go wrong with sparkling water &amp; chocolate! I will not drink with you today :)
Hey welcome back so soon! I saved your post for the future because this is always me. I have one decent experience with alcohol and think I've managed to get a handle on it and inevitably end up with that terrifying anxiety. ..Hopefully next time I get the urge to dip my toe into the waters of moderation I'll read your post and relate to it as I am right now.
made it to 308 days and had to start over because of last night. Here's to not drinking today.
9 days is a big deal for any drinker babe. Good for you that you came right back here. For me moderation seems like even more effort than not drinking. So I'm just gonna not drink now. No not today.
Ok this same thing happened to me. Margaritas and stopping at the liquor store on the way home. That was like 3 years ago but I remember it so vividly. Glad I do because now I know. Lesson learned. 
9 days was massive and you did it so you can do it again and surpass it. I've had a lot of trouble relapsing recently. I'm trying to take positivity from recognising it and climbing back on the wagon for as many stops as possible. It's better than not getting back on at all.  I'm not drinking with you.
