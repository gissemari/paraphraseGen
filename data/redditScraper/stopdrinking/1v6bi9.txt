Wow. Days start to fly by when your life fills up with the gifts of recovery. And I certainly received many of those gifts. A homeowner. Gainfully employed with my organization wishing to promote me. Friends. Family. Ladies interested in me... and they're attractive. ..I'm not here to boast though. Just feel those new should know sobriety brings gifts. Gifts I thought reserved for others. Not me...But year 2 has been a struggle. I guess it's growing pains. I've made some stupid decisions at times. I do feel I'm in a much better place today. Life means something at last. With growing pains comes growth so my struggles bear fruit. It helps to remember that in spite of how I feel on the inside I can still do good...Thank you r/stopdrinking for the stories some tragic some inspiring some angry some melancholic. The range of human experience provides nourishment necessary for this alcoholic to stay sober. My inbox is always open. Hope to hear from some of you on the path!
