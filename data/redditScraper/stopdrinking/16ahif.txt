Hey SD.  I am so grateful to be here today and just wanted to give a shout out to the community.  Thank you!  ..Thank you for your stories of success that allow me to believe that I am on the right path and reinforce everything I am doing.  ..Thanks to the newly sober ones out there for having the courage to post your struggles to remind me that I too was in your shoes.  Keep fighting because it does get easier.  Thank you all!  ..Today I can honestly say that my name is sgreenha and I am a very grateful alcoholic..
