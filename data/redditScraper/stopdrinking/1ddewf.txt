To say it's been difficult is an understatement it's still proving to be very difficult. I'm proud of myself though as this is the longest I've ever gone without drinking since I started. I even managed to go to a pub/bar and stay on soft drinks while my friends drank alcohol made me realise that while it still wants to draw me back in I do have the ability to say no. It's also saved me so much money that I've actually been able to save some for once...I have struggled on the Friday nights which I'm dealing with by going to the gym which is taking my mind off the drink and making me too tired to even think about going for a drink afterwards so that seems to be something I can use to keep me going. I'm usually just a lurker but I thought I'd say hello :)....

Hello to you! I'm right about where you are (though this is like the millionth time I've tried). Good luck to both of us. I think reading and commenting on this sub has really helped. 
Say hello more often! Seriously though I can't credit SD enough for giving me the support I needed to make it this far. ..Glad to hear you are hitting the gym. I've been lifting weights at home and it has made a huge difference. I don't just feel sober I feel great. ..Keep up the good work!
Thoughts of drinking eventually became less and less for me. But also as they were less frequent occasionally they have been even more profound. I had the strongest urge to drink a few weeks ago my feelings and events of that day were practically the perfect storm. It was mostly the feeling of self-pity I wanted a pity party for myself...Keep on keeping on the benefits are there when you stick with it. Plus any relapse you know is not going to be worth it.
