Without changing my lifestyle too drastically much aside from filling those extra hours I now remember during the day with walking I've lost ~30 pounds just from cutting drinking out of my life. I sleep better my skin is clearer I've got more energy and I'm not nearly as depressed as I used to be. No real exercise regimen for the weight loss I'm just not drinking half a fifth of whiskey/8-10 beers a night anymore... https://imgur.com/a/lmlTq..Edit: it's been about 2 months now with a couple of relapses... which is why my badge is where it is

Good job. The difference is really noticeable in your skin and face.
That's a huge difference. Well done.
Congrats! You look great. 
Keep going. Doing great!!!
No offense but it doesn't look like you lost 30 lbs!
I'm glad you're so much happier now! I can't wait until your face gets the news
Hey good for you!! You look great. Glad to hear that you are feeling better too.
Congrats!  You look more cut :)
I can really tell the difference in those photo's. You may not of been photogenic when drinking but you sure as hell are now! Keep up the good work - I've found the rewards of not drinking continue.
Keep up the good work!
Great work.  You look like you have been doing some serious exercise even though you haven't    cutting thousands of calories of alcohol does amazing things to our bodies.
Awesome congrats! Use that as motivation to stay sober if nothing else!
Good job bro! Keep up the amazing work
Good job. Start lifting and you would be cut as fuck. Your not really that fat so you have an advantage. I took up lifting after I quit drinking in January. It's insane how much my body changed. Gotta replace all that drinking time with stuff to keep busy. Good job and good luck.
Good Job.........Keep up the great work!
Way to go!!
