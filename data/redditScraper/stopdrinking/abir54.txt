2 years ago today it was time. I was finished. Alcohol and I had gone as far with each other as we could possibly go. I don't know exactly what made 1/1/2017 any different from the countless other days I resolved to quit/curb my drinking but this time it seemed to stick...Thankfully the physical withdrawals weren't severe. Thankfully I didn't do irreparable damage to my body and mind. Thankfully I never killed myself or someone else while driving drunk. Thankfully G-d gave me the strength to be bored sad angry and sleepless without having to turn back to booze. Thankfully I had supportive family and friends. I am so thankful. For all of it. ..I've written before about how not long after I turned 21 I knew I should stop drinking. I didn't stop until I was 31. I don't know why this attempt to quit drinking has lasted for 2 while the previous tries lasted a month weeks days or sometimes merely hours. ..But I do know I try to operate with as much graditude as possible. I try to think through my words and deeds and the motivations behind them. I work hard (it's hard work) to be as aware as possible of other people's feelings and perspectives. I've also worked hard to stand my ground because what is right for my mental and physical well being might be annoying or seemingly stupid to others. I work really hard to say sorry often and forgive freely. I wake up everyday and tell myself that the world doesn't owe me a damn thing. ..These last two years have been the best of my adult life. There has been no downside to quitting drinking. Quitting drinking has been one of the best decisions I've ever made. ..I am eternally grateful that I've been able to not drink for the last 2 years. I'm thankful for my family. I'm thankful for my friends. I'm thankful for the love of my life who is currently sleeping in the next room and who I plan on asking to be my wife this year. Thank you to this subreddit. ..Happy new year everyone. If you're thinking about quitting alcohol do it. You will never regret it. If you've quit and you're struggling: go easy on yourself.
