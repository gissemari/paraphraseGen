I relapsed pretty hard and drank about 4 bottles of wine over the course of Tuesday/Wednesday. But I am not giving up. I have done some hard drinking this year but also had the longest stretches of sobriety and have began to look into the issues that cause me to drink more deeply. Grateful to still be here and not drinking with you all today.

Thank you for your courage to post!..&gt; issues that cause me to drink more deeply..In my case it was very simple to learn what caused me to drink more. I was addicted to alcohol. The reasons that lead up to that addiction became unimportant and got lost overshadowed by the damage that alcohol was doing to me. Later on I returned to those underlying issues but not until I had some time without drinking...Instead of thinking of myself as a failure a fuck-up and a monster I had to learn to see myself as a sick person. You wouldn't beat up on another sick person would you? That's how I began to learn to treat myself with love and kindness unconditionally no matter what. I had to become my own loving parent...Here are lists of top-voted stopdrinking posts on various topics and the last link is for immediate relapse prevention: ..[consequences](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=consequences&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[alcoholic](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=alcoholic&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[relapse](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=relapse&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[moderation](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=moderation&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[humility](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=humility&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[atheist](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=atheist&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[decision](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=decision&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[attitude](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=attitude&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[prison](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=prison&amp;restrict_sr=on)..More Help: [Steps_1_2_3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/477gm4/demystifying_the_steps_simply_a_set_of_tools_part/) --.[12 Steps No Religion](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3wdrft/after_some_editing_in_the_dino_den_an_agnostic/) --.Having an urge to relapse?

I'm glad you're here and back at it!!! Twenty victorious sober days - good foundation for your journey. Wishing you well. I will not drink with you today.
Glad you're back! And I'm glad you realize you're not starting over from nothing. You've learned a lot and spent a lot of sober time over the past weeks. That will make the next stretch a little easier. I will not drink with you today!
Welcome back friend! I'm proud of you for returning!
