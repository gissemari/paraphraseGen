I'm sorry I keep posting here so often. But I've really been thinking about quitting. The only problem is is actually doing it. I can't seem to take that first day off. The stress of quitting isn't helping me and then I over think so much. I haven't had some major event happen to slap me in the face but I don't want to live with this habit any more. I feel pathetic that I'm not strong enough to stop for an entire day even though ever part of me wants to. I'm super conflicted and confused and sad. ..Edit: when I drink and sober up I feel the strongest about not doing again. It's in my sober moments that I relapse and can't help myself

This used to happen to me too. I would take a few days off I'd start feeling great again and then I would get drunk because I was feeling so great. The first few weeks are the toughest. ..I broke through those first few weeks by setting much smaller goals. One day at a time. Not drinking today. Not drinking this weekend. Not drinking for 1 whole week etc. My goals have been getting long but the strategy is still the same: I won't drink **today**. ..If you're interested I won't drink with you **today**. 
You are here and you are posting. That's a great start. This place is brilliant and everyone here is so supportive of success and stumbles alike. ..I decided that I would never know if I could do it if I never tried. Don't think ahead and predict failure. Just look at today and only today. The amazing feeling of going to bed at night on the first day without having drunk that day was a very exciting feeling for me and I felt so proud. ..I now realise that I had nothing to fear and everything to gain.
There is a great book called This Naked Mind that many people decide to just stop drinking after reading it.  There is a link to a free download in the sidebar.  I won't drink with you today.
Keep posting! As often as necessary! ..There's always a reason to keep drinking if we keep looking for one. It's really difficult to take the plunge... especially if you over think it. Quite the cycle we get ourselves stuck in huh? ..I only told my husband and 2 friends that I was going dry. Mostly because I was embarrassed that I'd gotten myself to that point but also because I didn't want to hear any "I told you so"s if/when I relapsed. Once I felt stronger in sobriety I started talking to others about it. I didn't find SD till I was dry for 4 months... by then I'd done a lot of the heavy lifting alone. You're lucky to have found SD to help through (what I considered) to be the most difficult time. We're here to help! Take care of yourself I won't drink with you.
Don't apologize for posting! I am here ALL THE TIME. This sub is seriously the only support I've found that helps. I was on a 3 day cycle: .Day 1: drink to excess.Day2: feel sick and depressed and vow to stop.Day 3: pride for not drinking today..Ugh then day 1 again. ..I am doing a "let's just make it thru today. If you change your mind tomorrow then fine. But today no booze." So far it's working. Like a mini- challenge. Everyday. 
The Naked Mind really touchs on the conscious mind not wanting to drink and the unconscious mind not getting that memo. I'm reading the book again for the second time. I also don't want to drink but often end up drinking too. &lt;3 you're not alone.
I didn't have a particular aha moment. People ask me why I've stopped did I get hammered one night and said that's it! For me it was an accumulation of things and basically I was tired of my drinking life. Things had to change and then I said one day at a time. I don't say never again as that scares me and I honestly don't know what's around the corner in my life. So one day at a time. Yes there are hard times but then there are fab times. I have a new saying live the moment don't think about next week or when I'm slim I'll be happy I live for that moment today and enjoy it. All I can say is it's so worth it. Good luck oh and I posted more and read more on this sub than I do now because to had got easier. But I still look everyday and thank his sub every day. 
Different methods work for different people. For me AA just sounded like daily self torture. I discovered Rational Recovery RR and the AVRT (Alcoholic Voice Recognition Technique) it made a lot more sense to me. Try reading Rational Recovery by Jack Trimpey it might be worth a shot.
