Hes not my boyfriend...just someone I've been seeing since July. He was really supportive of me being sober and going to AA. ..I was sexually assaulted in July 2017. It destroyed my life for awhile. But I've been stronger now. I had a more positive outlook on life. But the other dayit hurt. The assault. I was shaking and paranoid he would come hurt me again...So stupid me went and got a beer. I went to my boyfriends (easier to call him that) and cried to him. He was really confused why I had a beer and tried to take it away from me several times. I tried to tell him I was assaulted but shame kept me from doing it. I drank the beer and got high and went to sleep. As far as I know my boyfriend did not drink that night. He always does. Every night. It's no big deal to me. ..I think hes going to break up with me soon because of it. I feel so stupidlostand lonely. One relapse and its changed my life. Are you fucking kidding me? My boyfriend has gotten drunk a bunch of times in front of me and has said some hurtful shit. But the one time I relapseI'm all of a sudden unattractive? BtwI dont hang out with him anymore when he drinks a lot...I'm going to AA all next week. I don't know if I'm ready to work the steps or have a sponsor. I'm in therapy.

Hi there I'm so sorry to hear about your assault that's something no one should ever have to deal with. ..I've been working through some of my own past trauma in therapy and my therapist has told me several times that it's not a linear process. Sometimes I make progress and feel good about where I'm at sometimes I struggle with things that I thought I'd resolved and go back to old coping strategies. It's not steady upwards progress. She also reminds me that healing happens in it's own time frame and it's a real kindness to myself to give myself the time that I need to process and heal from trauma. It takes as much time as it takes it's not something that a person  should  be over already...From what you described it sounded to me like your boyfriend was concerned more than anything. It might be worth talking to him about it.
