It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-----------------------------------------..**Struggle:** I have a house guest who is French and who smokes. Even though I quit smoking (with great difficulty) many years ago sometimes a cigarette after a meal looks *very* tempting. I haven't weakened and won't but damn! Why do I still get the urge to smoke after all this time?..**Triumph:** I participated in an art show over the weekend. It sounds corny but is totally true that I thought about you guys here at SD a lot because it's the encouraging words some sobernauts have said to me about my art that have kept me going. ..I'm pleased to report that **all three** of my pieces sold. Here's a (not very good) [photo](https://i.imgur.com/gFo5kwT.png) of two of the collages. (Sorry about the glare on the glass.)..**General:** Recently I have learned the power of saying (in a pleasant but firm way)  I know but *I don't care. * ..Here are some examples of actual conversations I have had over the past few weeks:..**Fellow Art Show Volunteer:**  Peggy Professional is annoyed that you are enforcing the rule of three paintings per artist. She feels that she should get special treatment. ..**Me:**  I know but *I don't care. *..AND..**My Mother:**  You're a pretty girl. But you would be even prettier if you wore makeup more often. ..**Me:**  I know but *I don't care. *..AND..**My Inner Critic:**  If you had applied yourself harder over the years you probably could have done better in your career. ..**Me:**  I know but *I don't care. *..I have found that this phrase can be a surprisingly effective way to put an end to a conversation there is really nothing else to say. (By the way did you notice that the voice of my mother and the voice of my inner critic are almost identical?).
----------immediate responses--------

Nice work!  I'm not surprised that you did well at the show.  Rock on girl!..**Struggle:**  While standing in line today to get ice cream I told a friend of mine "Today is a day that I definitely would have ordered a shot and a beer after work if I was a drinker.  But I'm not.  I'll have some ice cream instead."  It was a rough work day.  Just new job stuff.  The adjustment is rough on many levels.  The voice in my mind asking if I made the right decision is gaining volume.  It can fuck off.  ..**Triumph:** 2 months cigarette free.  And I'd be chain-smoking like a drunk-ass chimney if I was drinking for sure...**General:**  I really need to give less fucks. I'll try and fit in a few of those "I know but *I don't care" comments myself.  .
Congrats again on the art show u/sfgirlmary - those pieces are beautiful!..**Struggle:**     We thought I had a cyst on my knee so my doc sent me for an ultrasound yesterday. It's not a cyst so next up: MRI. The struggle? It's preventing me from running and working out :(...**Triumph:**     On Sunday SO took me to his work sites to show me how much he's done (builder). He thought I was upset because he's been working so much - so I thought it was really nice that he made the effort for me to see his (very) successful projects :).  ..**General:**     "I know but *I don't care*": I usually say IDGAF ;). Now where's that bar of soap for this mouth?! 
All great... yu guys make me laugh. And very nice pictures sfgirl.. congrats on the show your sales and your Post... cause that opens the door for the witty commentary.  I'll keep your line ... in my brain for use when those at times pointless conversations need to be concluded quickly. 
My go to is always "I do what I want." It used to be a great catchphrase for being a party girl. "I do what I want so I'm gonna buy 3grams of cocaine and 10 shots of tequila." Now I'm trying to move more towards a "I do what I want so I'm gonna go to bed at 8pm tonight and the world be damned." It's a process...Struggle: Sobriety in general. I keep dipping back and forth between abstaining and getting annihilated but I also keep coming back here so there's obviously a big part of me that thinks there's value in not drinking. I just need to convince my lizard brain of its value at 10pm on a monday when I'm like "I'll just go out for a few that's a normal thing to do." Not normal for me. I can swing from the chandeliers and order a bunch of shots the second I start talking to a bartender and mysteriously still be awake at 5am when I'd intended to be out for an hour. But a few drinks.. that's a pretty rare occurrence. ..Triumph: In my bouts of sobriety and non-sobriety I've been learning a lot about myself. I've been getting better at identifying triggers and reasons for my self-sabotaging/self-destructive behaviours. I stopped self-harming a few years ago after about 13 years on-and-off pretty much without even trying. It was just a behaviour that fell away. Earlier this year I went a substantial amount of time without doing drugs the longest stretch of time without since I'd started doing them. My binge drinking is nowhere near it was a few years ago. I feel like I've started to value myself more slowly and with that certain things have become less appealing. So even though I have relapses I'm less anxious because I know that I keep coming back and I'm hoping eventually it will stick. Still disappointing but it doesn't make my feel like a huge sack of shit anymore because I see how far I've come.
Lovely photos SFgirlmary!  Congrats! ..Struggle: Had a cousin (I come from family of drinkers) visit this past weekend.  On my way home from work Friday I had that convo in my mind 1 glass won't hurt just sip it slowly etc.  ..Triumph: I didn't drink I told her I quit.  My cousin opened up about her own drinking and struggle with depression.  In many ways I feel that talking about our family history of both helped her feel stronger and not so alone.  It sure helped me!..General: 60ish days sober and damn I feel so happy!..
&gt;  I know but I don't care. ..This!!!  Good for you!..**Struggle:** Coming to terms with the idea that I am definitely one of those people who should not drink and actively doing some work to figure out why I drink.  Past attempts have been half-hearted and I have been reluctant to follow my doctor's advice to get on anti depressants and seek counseling.  After all alcohol is the only issue...right?  Wrong!..**Triumph:**Actively seeking help now.  Have been on a low dose of anti depressants and I have an appointment with a counselor this afternoon.  I also stopped lurking here and am actively participating in the community. ..**General:**to quote r/AntsyAngler &gt;I really need to give less fucks. I'll try and fit in a few of those "I know but I don't care" comments myself.  Also I am very thankful that my relationships with my husband and sons are very strong and I started doing something about my drinking before it damaged our family..
Struggle: Work is piling up and getting annoying. Just got to get through it - I suppose busy is better than bored!..Triumph: I made myself a budget and am planning to track spending to see what can be cut to increase my savings. It'll be handy to be able to remember exactly what I've spent rather than estimating the spend on drinks/ food/ Uber at the end of a night!..General: Can't believe it's already August! Back home on the weekend which should be fun. Trail race Sunday which will definitely be fun!..IWNDWYT 
Struggle: It's increasingly looking as if my mother might be coming to live *with me*. After I've worked so hard to get and maintain my home -- a sober refuge from her mood swings and yes her alcoholism. I can't say no but I will need to be strong in enforcing some rules. 
Good morning u/sfgirlmary and congrats on the art show! That's terrific! Also my inner critic sounds suspiciously like my mother as well . . . hmmm . . . ..**Struggle** First 3 days of a new month are the toughest at my new job and everyone is looking to me to see a spectacular failure I'm pretty sure. I've been dreading this week and I'm happy it's here so I can get it the fuck over with...**Triumph** All systems are go on our home sale and our home buy it appears. I'm proud of how I've held it together doing my job at the busiest time of year and doing it well while being the Realtor for BF &amp; I myself. Would not be doing nearly so well were I drinking. ..**General** Just getting ready to move!
Fantastic art work and congratulations on a successful show! Art is certainly more than making money (cue Van Gogh's life) but financial validation has it's own particular charm doesn't it?..**Struggle:** I'll be going to a large Charity Gala tonight with my core group of friends. Nobody really knows that I'm not drinking. Conveniently I'm on antibiotics and when asked I just say that I can't drink for the time being while I'm on meds. Works for now...I have often referred to myself as the "Life of the party" and there is a certain expectation amongst my friends that I "perform" for them at these type of stuffy events. I worry that without this veneer of careless frivolity that I will no longer have a primary role in our highly social group. I am also beginning to understand that I play this game out of some deeper need to be liked and accepted. That being the class clown/court jester is the role that I have been assigned and the role that I "must" fulfill. I truly feel like I'm letting these people down by not playing my part. The struggle is real...I grew up with an alcoholic father who had a very similar personality trait and I see more clearly now that I am unconsciously following in his footsteps. ..**Triumph:** I am playing the tape forward and look forward to seeing Day 16 on my badge tomorrow morning when I check in! IWNDWYT...**General:** I read a great deal of acknowledgements on this site about gratitude: I am so grateful that I found SD. I feel like it was the missing piece of the puzzle for me to truly embrace sobriety and change my life for the better...Rock on everyone with your badass selfs and I'll check in tomorrow. Be well. I love you.
**struggle:**  I'm having a really really hard time picking up the phone with regards to AA.  A woman who I admire and would like maybe to ask to be my sponsor gave me her phone number and told me to use it but I just can't get myself to call.  I don't want to bother anyone.  I'm socially awkward.  I'm planning to call her after work today but I'm terrified.  I feel like a 15 year old trying to call someone for a first date...**triumph:** I've made it 6 weeks!  I feel like I'm building a life that doesn't involve getting smashed on the weekends.  I feel like I'm struggling way less when it comes to thinking of things to do on the weekends sans drinking. It's a nice place to be...**general:** I'm pretty tired this week.  I tested positive for mono a few weeks ago and I'm trying hard to keep up with meetings and all of the things that keep me sober but I'm definitely feeling the fatigue.  
Your collages are beautiful Mary! Congrats on the art show!..Struggle: I finally found something that seems to be improving my IBS situation but it makes me feel sick to my stomach for a while after taking it. It's like a big F you from the universe I can't just feel good all of the time I have to feel awful some of the time in order to feel normal most of the time. ..Triumph: I was able to plan out and coordinate a (hopefully) awesome little getaway for my husband's birthday this weekend before he leaves Monday for a work trip. I usually get pretty worried for my sobriety when he's away because I could drink and nobody would ever know about it but that doesn't seem appealing to me at all right now. I will stay vigilant when next week comes though. ..General: My grandson's pet hamster passed away last week. We got him shortly after moving into our house 3 years ago and I kind of got used to having him around. R.I.P Sasquatch he was a good hamster. 
Oh gosh!  How many times have I heard "If you would just do/be/......"  My favorite is "If you would just lose weight..."  ..This has hit me harder than I thought it would... I will not drink today.
Oooh Mary!!! Look at those!  I'm hypnotized by the sweet lines in the trees and mountains- it's pretty special stuff.  You got it don't you!  XO thank you for sharing these!!          
**Triumph:** I'm off to a great start with my financial goals this month!..**Struggle:** My knee's been acting up since this weekend. It's feeling alright now but I haven't climbed on it for the better part of a week and the earliest I can bike'll be tomorrow. Fingers crossed...**General (also another small triumph):** Last night I had sex for the first time :)
Great job at that art show! Your pieces are great no wonder they sold. ..I really feel you on the "I know but I don't care" about makeup. My mom has probably told me the EXACT same thing. I  don't care! :)..\*\*Struggle:\*\* I'm feeling pretty confident about not drinking lately but I feel like it's time to get my sweet tooth under control and take the last 15ish pounds of my weight loss seriously. But it's so hard when ice cream exists... ..\*\*Triumph:\*\* This weekend I made it through 2 back to back parties including people I didn't know at both events without drinking a drop. I volunteered to drive between them so there was added accountability. I said some awkward stuff because I'm an awkward person but I didn't feel the usual crippling anxiety about it that I would have if I had been drinking. Three cheers for La Croix!..\*\*General:\*\* I'm really trying to get myself to slow down in life a bit. I have trouble not looking to the Next Big Thing all the time which for me and my SO is trying to purchase a home. The truth is homes in our area are completely out of our reach financially (literally condos go for $800k and detached houses average $1.2 million and they're not even big) and we're not even sure we want to live in this area long term. However job wise it makes no sense to move right now and we have a pretty good and affordable rental situation at the moment. The thing that makes the most sense is to sit tight for a few years and save. But I find myself itching for the next move....trying to practice gratitude for what I already have and patience for the next thing.
**Struggle:** I hit my rock bottom Monday night. I'm having trouble going cold turkey though because I get very sick and throw up constantly until I have a drink. I still have a job to go to so I am doing my best to taper but one drink leads to a 5th of Vodka...**Triumph:** I went to my first meeting last night. I'm agnostic but I saw a comment on another thread on this sub that made me look at the higher power differently. The person described AA as their higher power and as of right now that seems like the way I need to look at it. ..**Personal:** I can't lose my wife. She and our dogs are my world. But she made it explicitly clear that if I continue on this path of drinking she WILL leave me. And if I do I very much feel that she should. I don't at this point feel that I'm worth making her worry constantly. ..Thanks for letting me share. 
Turns out alcohol wasn't the source of my depression. I'm an absolute mental mess. It's getting amplified thinking out of of control I must have been drunk. I don't want to drink again but damn dude I can't get away from this hell in my head
I love your art and congratulations on selling all your pieces! Thank you for sharing...**Struggle:** I'm working way too much early in the morning and late at night. I need to figure out how to balance out work and life. I feel that since I'm not drinking I'm pouring all of this energy into work and I need to chill out. ..**Triumph**: I don't really have cravings anymore. The reasons I used to drink to numb pain and awareness of anything difficult in my life are going away. I want to be aware and in the moment and I don't want to feel drunk anymore...**General**: We built a house last year and it's ended up costing us a lot more than we had originally budgeted for. We are in a dispute with the builder so it may end up costing us even more than we've already spent. I don't want to be house poor and am seriously thinking that we need to abandon this 2 year plus project and move into something smaller and more affordable. I hate that we've wasted all this time on a house we may not live in but I think long term it will be better on everyone. I've had so many fights with my husband about money and it's not worth it.
I freaking love your work!!  You are so talented.  Congratulations on the show!  And can confirm that inner critic sounds much like well-meaning mother...**Struggle:**Well-meaning mother reminded me how I'm not doing what I like in a career and that she really wants me to live nearby.  Trying to beat back my inner judge and guilty feelings.  She wasn't mean about it just really wants to see me get a neat job and wants her daughter to live closer.  But man that is a sore spot for me.  Trying not to feel like a loser and beyond hope for change in this arena...**Triumph:**  Still staying on the fitness focus.  I usually go a few months successfully and then let my feelings determine my focus.  I'm really working on increasing discipline in various facets of my life and have been running and hitting the gym regardless of what my id is saying.  And it shows!  Allowing my emotions to run the show about what actions I take in life is my biggest weakness.  Learning discipline to meet big picture goals is so intertwined with my sobriety I cannot imagine drinking again and losing all of this hard-earned commitment!..**General:**  Did you know that Shania Twain grew up in poverty lost both of her parents at a young age contracted Lyme disease and lost her voice and lost her husband to her best friend and STILL is country music's best-selling female artist of all time?  Got free tickets to see her unexpectedly and she was never any favorite of mine. But both her performance and story was inspiring!
**Struggle/Triumph:** I saw a new therapist for my depression issues on Monday. I called that morning pretty desperate and was able to get an appointment for the afternoon. As I told the therapist "I'm not sure if this is proactively recognizing I've got my hands full and asking for help or that I've dropped everything and am figuring out what's shattered and what can be repaired." I continue to swing moment by moment from thinking of it as a triumph or struggle...**Definitely Triumph:** Despite depression-related major brain-fuck ups I had a great time at a running race over the weekend. I had hoped to finish faster but I'm pleased with my performance. Both during the race and socializing before/after...**General:** I've been imagining using  mary's "I know but *I don't care.*" I don't think it would have the desired results either with my 8-year-old or nominally adult coworkers :/
Struggle: Work is picking up and internal resources are being mismanaged again which happens every month or two. Going to be a fun couple of weeks trying to keep my head above water here. And unfortunately I have several side gigs lined up over the next week as well giving myself extra work. Whoops...Triumph: I biked to a new trail last weekend and got some photos I'm pretty happy with. Also having the side photo gigs lined up is technically a triumph as well but not without its own stress haha. ..General: I've been feeling mostly content the past two months or so. It's weird. I swung from probably the most depressive I've been all year to the best I've felt in even longer. I'm cherishing this happiness but wondering how long it will last.  I started feeling kinda down again last week but some self-care over the weekend fixed that...Just need to stay vigilant. 
Struggle: I have three weeks to buy a car before I go back to school to finish my degree and I'm stressed out because I dont know shit about cars...Triumph: I got promoted at work and my schedule is changing to mon-fri. I no longer work weekends! I can do shit again and go to punk shows!..General: Im going to lunch today with my partner his cousin and his cousin's husband. The cousin is pretty cool but the cousin's husband is a concicted sex offender and makes me really uncomfortable because he is so fucking weird in a "this guy is obviously a convicted sex offender" kind of way. I dont know what he got convicted for other than it had something to do with minors.
**S:**  NCLEX in less than a week! Dog's skin condition is flaring up exhausted still from bringing daughter down south and turning around and coming back my ex is still psychotic and still hasn't paid her phone bill got some really bad neck pain mail gives me really bad anxiety all kinds of e-mail  i've created multiple e-mail accounts so I don't have to deal with e-mails my primary account has over 18000.  And my dryer is still broken and the laundrymat in my town is horrible...**T:**   My daughter is at her Mom's and I have some time to study...**G:**  My daughter was saying that I'm mean and she asked me why I'm so mean and she asked "Can you please just not be mean to anyone for two days?"  I told her yes and she was all happy.  Then I told her when you're gone I just won't talk to anyone for two days.  :)
sfmary So happy that you were rewarded with sales for taking the risk and entering the show. Lovely collages! .Struggle: My feelings of enthusiasm and interest have taken a summer vacation. .Triumph: De badge de badge!.General:  Wanting external validation. Which may actually belong under struggle. 
Struggle: While depression drove my drinking and the drinking definitely made it worse even without drinking the depression is still there. I've been exercising more and spending more time outdoors but it's certainly still a struggle. ..Triumph: I went to my first AA meeting this morning. I was terrified but i met some amazing people and will be going back to the next meeting as well...General: Big thanks to SD for helping give me the motivation to quit and for the courage to find a meeting.
Happy Hump Day y'all hope you're being blessed with decent weather (last week it was pouring here so at least we get to see the sun today)..**Struggle:** I'm currently at war with my outpatient rehab center.  I requested a transfer from the facility I go to currently to one closer to my home and it's been an uphill battle ever since. Suddenly my drug screens are testing positive for benzos (which they gave me during detox) and EtG (its a metabolite of alcohol that implies you've been drinking but positives can come from any exposure to alcohol such as hand sanitizer and perfume so it's controversial to the point that FDA and SAMHSA have research implying it's not entirely useful in determining alcohol use). I only used my detox benzos as prescribed and I haven't had a drink but now I'm being told they won't initiate the transfer until my drug tests are clean and they've cleared up any potential use. Each interaction with a staff member over these tests/the transfer has been condescending patronizing or completely dismissive. No one there seems to know my medical/medication history and I keep getting a changing story. I'm upset because they initally helped me get sober and helped me bounce back quickly when I relapsed but now it seems like I'm being put through this absolute Hell. I know I didn't drink and I know it's their job to call me out if they have reason to believe I did but I DIDN'T. I know I didn't. It's so annoying. I think it's sort of ironic that my rehab center is my main source of stress while I'm being told that I should be reducing stress to avoid another relapse. GAAAAAH...**Triumph:** Aside from my rehab center issue the other areas of my life seem to be going pretty well. I've been working out almost every day since my relapse a few weeks ago I've been getting to SMART/AA/rehab meetings work is good my relationship with my parents is good and I feel pretty good. Between work/rehab/working out/meetings I'm also trying to find an individual therapist psychiatrist dentist and doctor because I'm finally trying to be an adult and take care of myself and while it's challenging to fit it into my schedule I'm not losing my mind over it. I'm getting better at controlling my reactions to situations that I would usually completely overreact in. ..**General:** I don't want to say I'm grateful for my relapse but I feel like something is finally clicking when it comes to my sobriety. I'm actually willingly getting out of my apartment on a regular basis. I'm starting to develop a structure in my life that I haven't had as an adult ever.  I'm starting to develop a momentum for moving forward in my life without alcohol. It's not happening as fast as I want it to but I'm realizing it's ok to make progress a little bit at a time. It's interesting I'm doing things I used to do when I was drinking that I wanted to do sober but I'm doing them sober and without regrets or anxiety. For years I've been saying I wanted to get a tattoo long before I ever started drinking. It was my go-to thing when I was drunk and we were out to be the one to scream "LET'S GO GET TATTOOS" and I'm grateful no one let me do that. I got my first tattoo right after I got out of my second detox because I wanted to and I could. I did it sober and I have no regrets about it. I'm texting guys (I know I technically shouldn't be doing this but I used to only do it drunk and was always to anxious to do it sober) I'm meeting people to go to meetings with....it's like I sort of feel more alive and present in society than I did when I was drinking or when I was sober before my relapse. I don't live in my bed and eat take out all day on Saturdays I work out and go to my meetings. I think before I thought about sobriety as just trying to get from one day to the next and watch my sobriety counter app add up days one by one....sort of making sobriety just a sober day-by-day countdown to my death. Now....it's like I'm realizing this is going to be more a journey than a destination. ../longcheesyrant
