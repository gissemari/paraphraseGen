Hey SD! unfortunately it's been a while since I've posted here due to some shitty decisions and relapsing. However I can happily say I'm on day 4 of no alcohol! Which is fucking awesome because fuck that poison. So I've been soooooo damn tired these past few days like ugh all I wanna do is sleep!! Did anyone else experience this with early sobriety?  And happy New year to all of y'all I'm glad to be back and sending everyone positive sober vibes ! Xoxo

Welcome back. Sounds like your body clock might be readjusting? A small price to pay!..Happy New Year...IWNDWYT
Girl!!! Great to see ya! Glad you came back to ring in the new year with us ;).
Even one drink can interfere with proper REM sleep. Your brain is probably trying to adjust with the absence of the depressant. Soon you will require less sleep and feel well rested. Hang in there.
OMG. I have been SO tired.
