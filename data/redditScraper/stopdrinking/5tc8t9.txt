I don't have an official sponsor. Rather I had a sponsor that I worked with for about a year and then she moved. She said she didn't want to be my sponsor because she was so far away and she wanted someone closer for me. She really valued the in-person meetings. But we have reconnected recently and are talking everyday. She has me reading the big book going to meetings and reading the Daily Reflection everyday and texting my thoughts on it to her. So she isn't officially my sponsor but she does everything she did before as my sponsor. Except working the steps. I have some resistance to that that I we'll explore. Because I would really like to work the steps...What I like about my sponsor and what I like about this sub is the acknowledgement that different people need different things. My sponsor agrees that I also need a psychiatrist and a therapist that twelve steps would not be nearly enough. My sponsor also allows me to reject certain things in AA if they bother me. What I mean about that and this is probably very common is that we recognize it was written a long time ago so there were some problems with it such as I think the disease model is a little over simplistic although I do believe alcoholism is a psychological illness based upon DSM criteria...I also really struggle with the chapter to the wives because it assumes all alcoholics are male and in heterosexual relationships. But this is a product of the times...I even was really freaked out about the God thing until I figured out my higher power was a non entity but rather the universe. It's bigger than me and I believe the universe has some kind of order. It's almost like science is my higher power if that makes sense...My sponsor also encourages me to go to NA meetings because I find them sometimes even better than AA. There's a level of desperation in the NA meetings I attend that I don't know that I see an AA and damn I feel desperate. I guess that's why I'm drawn to the AA meetings filled with people who are just out of jail are homeless Etc. I resonate more with their stories for some reason. Even though I've never been homeless or in jail. Well except the drunk tank I guess...I'm sort of rambling here but what I'm saying is that I have tools that work for me and I have a sponsor who is flexible enough to allow for a variety of tools in my toolbox. And this is something I wish for all alcoholics and other addicts. That we are flexible enough to try new things and see if they work. Wishing you all the best!
