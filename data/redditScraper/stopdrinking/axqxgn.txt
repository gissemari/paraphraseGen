I've been stuck in a loop for a while. Drink one day stop the next drink one day stop the next. I finally got over the hump of day 2 and today is day 3. I'm already having urges but am taking some comfort in the fact that last night even though I had the urge it felt easier to quell than normal and I didn't drink. I'm going to keep that in mind as the day winds down. I want to thank everyone on here for sharing their personal stories of struggle and success. It helps a lot!..&amp;#x200B;..IWNDWYT

Day two is crushing me right now but I will not drink with you tonight and I'll be in your shoes tomorrow for day three!
Day 2 and 3 were hard for me. Day 4 was better. Normally I'd start craving right about now and it hasn't hit me yet. So hoping that will last! You can do it! IWNDWYT
I hope you have a pleasant schedule to keep yourself busy tonight hanging out here and reading might be good too. See you back on day 4
