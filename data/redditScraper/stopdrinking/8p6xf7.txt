So my mom is having some major alcohol addiction problems. She started when her and my dad got divorced(his decision) which really messed her up. She later remarried and I thought that changed that because I hadn't heard of her drinking anymore. Occasionally she had a relapse but I've always dismissed it as her new husband being a jerk (which is he)  and spreading shit about her or taking crap out of proportion. However lately I've been hearing from my brother and sister in law how she has been getting wasted in church parking lots or graveyards just so her husband wouldn't know or whatever. Didn't really believe this until today when I saw her drunk getting out of the car with 4 empty wine bottles. I'm seriously considering that rehab might be an option for her that or maybe more counseling but according to new husband the counselor recommended rehab for her. I talked with her a couple times in the past and I try to not be too aggressive when telling her how I feel because I feel like a little alcohol is alright but at the same time drinking 4 bottles of wine and driving when you're 50 years old just because something bad happened in your day just is not okay. So I want to know if any of you have any experience with this or what suggestions you have that I can do to try and help her whether it be rehab or whatever because honestly she's my mom I'm only 25 and I can't imagine life without her

My father was an alcoholic....but I was too young to confront him. Thankfully he pretty much quit by the time I was an adult. But if I had been an adult when he would go on his binges...I would tell him exactly what you said....I am afraid to lose him because I love him so much. Maybe it would have changed him. Maybe it would not have. I don't know.  But I do know that you cannot change your mom you can just encourage and support her. Help her find resources. Tell her you love her. Hold her hand. BUT....you are too young to take the weight of this on. YOU are not the parent here....so make sure you set up some boundaries also. BIG hugs to you!!
Ugh this sounds so sad and overwhelming. I'm sorry your mom is going through this. ..I'm a recovering alcoholic and control freak. My controlling demon recommends you to force her down to have her watch a video of her behavior and drag her to rehab. However that is scarily insane and would not work...What I would suggest is going to an Al-Anon meeting and listen to what others tried. They should have resources available too for if you do confront her you'll be equipped with knowledge. ..Wish you luck!
