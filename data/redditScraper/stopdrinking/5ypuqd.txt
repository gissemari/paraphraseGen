I've missed more than 9000 shots in my life. I have lost more than 300 games. 26 times I have been trusted to make the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over agian in my life. And that is why I succeeded. -Michael Jordan...          Never give up any of you. I just saw this quote and had to share it here. It reminds me so much of my struggle for sobriety. Keep on coming back friends. Never give up. You only fail when you stop trying!!!
