Really struggling with lack of work and money issues. The idea of drinking is creaping back into my thinking. I have just set a mental goal of staying sober a day at a time for 300 days . Hope you all have a drink free day . Slainte

The devil is talking to you. Alcohol can't help with work and will drain what's left of your finances :-( xxx don't do it friend x
You can do this. Try to make some plans for alternative activities like reading or playing a favorite video game or going for some long walks. Having non-drinking plans to take me out of my head is always helpful for me. Good luck.
You've broke the back of this.  Keep going
You can do this. The struggle is real - but you're not alone. I will not drink with you this day..
You've got this.

A thousand thanks for all the encouraging replies . It really makes me feel that I am not alone in this struggle
&gt; The idea of drinking is creaping back into my thinking..This is natural and I'm sorry to hear you're going through some trying times. ..Be tough and fight off of these ideas with the knowledge that if you go back to drinking you will have less energy focus stress tolerance and quality sleep - all of which you will need to accomplish your goals! Stick to the grind. You'll eventually come out on top!
Hey dude - it's the answer to nothing can make any situation worse and if you're like me you want to drink loads not just a couple of beers. Find another way!
