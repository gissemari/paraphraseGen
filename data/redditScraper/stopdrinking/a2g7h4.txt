The last two times I hit 30 days I relapsed. I ended up in ICU both times. The first time I was in a coma as well as the second time. I technically died once. I'm so blessed to be here. Alcoholism is wicked. Please pray for me to stay strong and sober this time. I'm doing this on my own with no emotional support. I'm also bipolar which amplifies everything. Thank you for caring. Much love Diana

You can do this! 
How longer have you been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. It also was a struggle for me.
You can do this. You did it 29 days you can go one more and another. I just made a 48 hour pledge to not drink with another sobernaut and I will make the same pledge with you if you want to join me. I will not drink with you today or tomorrow. All the best to you.
Why were you in ICU? What happened?
How are you doing laroo?
