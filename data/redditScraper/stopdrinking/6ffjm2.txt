I have posted in the past about my own issues and i have become increasingly better at staying sober for long stretches of time. I slip now and again but i am healthy and feel relieved and blessed to have met a community of like-minded individuals who WANT to get better. I have tried my best to be a positive role model for my nieces and those around me who struggle against the poisonout bottle. But my best friend has serious serious problems. He drinks every day for the better of 20 years and never takes a day off. It's 3 nips and then god knows how many beers. Every. Single. Day. He has high blood pressure and was diagnosed with a fatty liver 15 years ago. High triglycerides you name it. At a concert last year beer stands were shut off early due to the late start time and he apparently didnt get his fill. Before the ride home he guzzled a couple nips because he told me he needed to get something into his system. This scared me as my own issues with beer in my 20s never progressed to this. I never had any shakes or anything but he confided in me he gets shakes and has liver pains during the day at work. I am not sure how far long he is but it seems to me that he is in late stage alcoholism. He says he might drink less if his wife wasn't so disorganized but that seems like his diseased brain is misleading him. Can anyone relate to his plight?

I always used to blame outside forces for my drinking too. If my life wasn't so goddamn shitty and stressful I wouldn't have had to drink so much. I'd quit once things got more stable. I have no idea how a disorganized wife could drive a husband to drink but boozers sure can turn *anything* into a reason can't we? ..That logic is exactly what keeps active alcoholics chained to the bottle. I don't think there is a good way to explain that to someone who isn't interested in hearing it. My liver hurts for months so I stopped taking Tylenol because of course Tylenol was the problem and not the vodka. Denial is serious and it sounds like your friend is right in the middle of it. ..I drank right up until my body began to shut down and it was terrifying. I hope your friend is able to get help... I honestly don't know how you could help until he asks for it though. :( You're a very kind friend. Does he talk to you about your drinking/sobriety? I think him seeing you happy and sober would be the best "advice" you can give him without forcing it on him. Does that make sense? 
I never got to the place your friend is at but it was enough of an issue that a variety of people over the years would give a little hint.  Like a friend once gave me the AA serenity prayer.  I was heavy smoker at the time and not a daily drinker at all but would have too many not a binge but over consumption.  I asked is this for my smoking?  I can't remember the reply.  The same person when I told her I got NLP CD to help quit smoking 3 years ago asked "Did you get CD's for anything else?" So I've known all along that these people were saying you drink too much.  Not one person ever said anything direct to me.  I guess one old friend said "Don't quit everything at the same time" That was 1998.  He was totally sober and had never drank.  I kind of wished someone would of had the courage to have a frank discussion instead of dropping little hints to me.  My 2 cents.  I won't drink with you today.  There is a chance this guy could turn it around. I've read some amazing come back stories. I've also been invited to AA 3 times over 30 years.  Non one said "I'm concerned about your drinking because of XY and Z.  I won't drink with you today.
