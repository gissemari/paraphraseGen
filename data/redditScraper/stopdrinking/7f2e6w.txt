I am so grateful to write this sentence  six months sober.  And I am so grateful that I have stumbled upon this thread and met this living and kind community. Had I not met you all I wouldn't have written this heading today. Thank you so much guys! ..I would like to share what I did to get here in the hope of helping someone else. ..1. Meditation.Daily meditation before I even tried to stop drinking helped so much in facing emotions and being mindful. This helped so much with quitting alcohol. My main triggers are emotional nature so being mindful really makes a huge difference. ..2. Self hypnosis for quitting addiction .I did this (https://youtu.be/zM5ynnc7f4o) selfhypnosis every morning for a couple of weeks before I quit drinking. Until I wanted really wanted to quit. It helped so much in seeing the me I'd rather be. ..3. This naked mind by Annie grace.I read this in the first and second week after quitting and it really shifted my perception of alcohol. Huge game changer for me. ..4. Journaling .Every day morning and night if it was bad even during the day. ..5. Affirmations and visualisations.Love to use these to see the best version of myself and have a positive something to work towards. ..6.  The 30 day sobriety program.I loved this book it has a task for every of those 30 days and has helped me so much in figuring out new values dreams and goals in sobriety. It was a great way to spend my evenings. It's full of great tools and strategies. I totally recommend this to everyone who wants their sober life to improve. ..These 6 month have gone so quickly. And it  is amazing how much better I feel. It surely has not been easy all the time but so worth it. And with every struggle and every emotion and fear I faced along the way I realised more and more how strong I really am.  And there have been plenty of reasons and opportunities I could have used for drinking. ..If you read this and are still in the very early stages keep going it will get better and better. I cannot even imagine what the future will hold. ..I will not drink with you today.Nic.
