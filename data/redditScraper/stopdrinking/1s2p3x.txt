Hey everyone it's Wednesday that means the week's half over! How's it been going? Share your triumphs struggles or just general chat!..Triumph: My relationship is going well it's by far the best I've been in ever.  There's no way I'd be with her if I were still drinking...Struggle: Feeling the holiday stress - much to do with little time...General chat: 20 days to Xmas!..Have a great 24 hours folks!
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph: I finally came to the conclusion that I'm an alcoholic after nearly nine years of drinking eels good to know I'm not alone...Struggle: I'm debating who in my life I should tell this to or if I should just keep it to myself for now.
You too mate!! Had a rough weekend and slipped get back up again on the horse though!! Sometimes I wish I could fast-forward but I'm sure we all do when we've goofed.

Triumph:Hosted Thanksgiving for 9 days sober. HOSTED THANKSGIVING FOR 9 DAYS SOBER. Struggle: Cravings. I think my alcoholism is more long term than I thought. General chat: 19 days  Baby! I'm as happy as that camel on you-know-what day!!
**Triumph**: Life is awesome.  Thanksgiving went well.  I'm still doing a lot of Krav Maga and have been able to get in some tennis too despite the cold weather...**Struggle**: I've got nothing.  See above...**General Chat**: Bring on the Spring.  I want moar tennis!
Good morning!..**Triumph**: I went to my first AA meeting last night. I was so nervous about walking into that room but it turned out to be a really positive experience! ..**Struggle**: The job I had been offered fell through so I'm back on the hunt. It's very frustrating but I have noticed that the longer I go without a drink the more drive/energy I have to get out there and take care of business. Still no regrets about leaving the brewery I was working at. No way I would have 12 days under my belt if I was still being tempted by free beer and industry events every day. No. Freaking. Way...**General Chat**: The weather has been amazing here for the past few days. Mild temperatures and gorgeous snow-filled evenings. There is nothing quite like taking a walk at night and watching the snow blink past the street lights. Everything sparkles!
Woo Wednesday!..Triumph: Ever since deciding to moderate rather than stay completely sober I have felt no desire to drink. So still going strong. Might have a beer during the big game this weekend (Go Green!)..Struggle: today is a good day but I struggled with eating over the holidays with my family. ..General chat: Big Ten needs to get it together tonight if they're gonna beat the ACC. Go Green!  again. :)
Triumph: life is feeling pretty good. I'm enjoying looking for things for the kids for Christmas. Physically I am doing great.  I'm going to turn 40 next month and I'm going to be in better shape than when I was 20...Struggle: nothing much.  My daughter is moody which is developmentally appropriate but I haven't figured out how to maintain patience with it.  I get exasperated with her when I would like to be more supportive.  We'll get through it.  She's like Longfellow's girl with a curl...General chat: something about not owning a tv makes the holiday season SO much more pleasant.
I'm still waiting to start a job I was supposed to begin on Monday. ..but my recruiter is lazy and unorganized so she didn't request my background check until the last minute and its not done yet. However by not drinking I see that she screwed up and I'm not depressed and twisting this into being my fault somehow. I feel confident and I can't wait to start my job so I can shake of this horrible recruiter. .
**Semi-triumph:** Finally asked my mom not to get me booze for Christmas but in a way that downplayed my situation. She still has no idea of the extent of my alcohol use. I told her I was just taking a break for a while because I didn't want to gain any weight (sort of a silly thing to say I'm in quite good shape). Sort of felt scummy to lie and a teensy offended that she said it was a really good idea for me to cut down for weight purposes haha (she's a little fixated on weight since my dad just constantly calls her fat even though she isn't). But hey it's out there now and I don't have to worry about boozey gifts...**Struggle:** now that I'm lucid at all times I have to like you know think about things. Very overwhelmed by the future feeling directionless and so alone. I don't know how to start my life it feels too late...**General Chat:** Going to Canada today! (I live in the US). Gonna see my boyfriend who is quitting too. I'm a little worried about some stuff but I have to let go and see what happens.

Struggling with life right now but not with drinking. Yay! 
Triumph: Not fucking up this semester as much as I did last semester. ...Struggle: I can't seem to stay sober. I keep going 3 days and then drinking. I want to get back into AA but I am having a hard time finding the time. But I need to get back in if only to get some numbers to call when I feel like I am going to drink. ...General Chat: Does anyone see a bright side to being an alcoholic?
Triumph: My fiance and I have saved 3000 dollars this month for the wedding. So grateful we can pay for this on our own...Struggle: Cutting my excessive sugar intake. Instead of dessert we have some delicious teas from David's Tea. I miss jelly beans...General chat: I should probably start Christmas shopping...
Triumph - planning yet another booze free birthday breakfast. doing stuff in the morning never loses its appeal. ..struggle - an acquaintance died from alcoholism. I recently lost two people in my life due to accidents - one was a car accident and the other was a police officer that was also in a car accident responding to a call at work. I am dealing with a lot of anger and resentment towards people who do not get help or turn down the help that people try and give them. life is so short and so fragile I just dont get it. anger is a trigger for me I am currently using my tools to get over this bump. ..general chat - just want to wish everyone another 24

Triumph: I've been killing it at school. Everything is getting done on time and it looks like it'll be another successful semester...Struggle: I still can't get over the fact that I pushed my girlfriend out of my life with alcohol. I don't think I'll ever be able to forgive myself...Have a good day everyone.

**Triumph:** I'm in the process of being hired. I've been able to complete an application in for a research fellowship. Had work featured in a more than nationally significant publication. Recognizing that these things might not be a fluke that I can feel good about them is a big step for me. Although I do kind of feel like a jerk now for mentioning these things...  .  .**Struggle:** Personal life is not going so well--still feeling heartbroken and insecure. There's so much static in my head and heart and it seems I just have to sit still and feel it out. A few troubling drinking dreams where I take a drink and then tumble through space. Not sleeping well. Poor appetite.  .  .**General chat:** Hi.
Triumph: This latest attempt at sobriety I have managed to stay completely open and honest with everyone involved in my recovery. And have let go of the last few reservations I had....Struggle: Thinking too far ahead Trying not to get 'pink cloud syndrome' because everything is going so well and I feel so right about sobriety this time.
**Triumph:** I am feeling so much better in the mornings and in the evenings and my disposition has improved a great deal. I may have known it at some level but I didn't fully comprehend the extent to which my getting drunk every night contributed to my depression. ..**Struggle** What do you mean all of my other physical issues have not yet resolved themselves magically on their own? I thought I would have dropped 20 pounds by now my vision would clear up and my greys would disappear.  What gives?  (grin)  ..**General chat:** I've been lurking on the chat line a bit and it's helpful just to know that there are others out there in real time giving each other strength when we need it..
Triumph: work is going well I've been given some additional responsibility which I like..Struggle: worrying I'm doing too well at this too soon
**Triumph:** Longest stretch without consuming any booze for months!..**Struggle:** Cravings are starting to kick in big time. Also worrying about how I'm going to handle staying sober during the holidays. :(..**General chat:** Somebody please save me from uni assignments arghhh!
**Triumph**: Work goes well. I'm still sober still working the steps. On Sunday I'll have my first first date in six and a half years...**Struggle**: Motherfucking snooze button...
Triumph: it's my 10th day sober which means I've beat my personal record. It feels great to wake up in the morning (well before noon) and not feel like death. I am so motivated to see this through!..Struggle: I miss my friends and although they don't question why I quit it's hard to not go hang out with them at the bar after work. Lots of free time on my hands. The holidays are rough visiting family and abstaining from drinking. ..General chat: any good recipes for non-alcoholic holiday drinks? ..Edit: my badge says 9 but it's really been 10...I don't know how to fix that...
Triumph:  Successful Thanksgiving this year.  No family blowout fights.  I didn't have any desire to drink (aside from one night when it was cold and we all sat around the table talking all night).  But no real 'I need a drink' desires.  Work is going well.  My cardiology appointment (and holter monitor) went well.  Things are going swimmingly...Struggle:  I feel very broke right now and having to buy Christmas presents exacerbates the feeling.
Its been 37 days but its felt like so much longer for some reason. Other than that im trying to think of an xmas gift for my father. he likes gadgets. any ideas?
Day 2 Wednesday.  Reporting in!..Have a great day everybody.
triumph: i have actually been rather productive lately in the creative sense. i've decided to make 90% of my christmas gifts this year. I usually procrastinate and flake out on myself anytime I begin a creative project but i've actually got a good start on it this year and have finished a few things already. i'm surprised at myself...struggle: anxiety. sleeplessness. back pain. i've been hovering in a state of almost getting sick for the last week and its driving me crazy. sniffly weak congested achey. sucks...general chat: hi. i've been lurking for the last few weeks but haven't really posted. day off today and i'm home alone so I decided to check in...
Triumph: Feeling better each day. Booked a Physical for the day after Christmas gives me more motivation to stay Sober. I want to get a good bill of health..Struggle: Overeating at night. I'm not big but really want to drop weight..General Chat: Read and responded to r/marjin's post it made me realise what a dirtbag drinking made me. 
Triumph - one month sober.  Feeling good and love not waking up hungover..Struggle - Not really sleeping any better but have a lot of work stress going on that I'm not numbing with alcohol every night... Not sure how I'll handle Christmas with the family and not drinking.. thinking about telling my folks so it's not a surprise..Chat - Anybody got beverage alternatives that don't have caffiene or sugar in them?  Getting maxed out on diet ginger ale and I'm not a hot tea person.  Peace everybody...
Triumph: Managed to maintain my sobriety through being dumped by the woman I love a week ago and dealing with a booze filled family Thanksgiving the day after..Struggle: More holidays.  Letting go of her isn't going easily ..*Edit - Got my 30 day chip. WOO!
Triumph:  Half a month sober!..Struggle:  Mood swings.  The past week has been terrible for them.  It's not uncommon for me to be incredibly happy and optimistic one minute and intensely angry over something that's of literally no importance the next.  Even when I realize my thoughts are ridiculous and actively try to calm myself it's difficult to stop the tidal wave that has already been set in motion.  The highs are too high (far higher than they have any reason to be) the lows are too low and I'm finding it difficult to keep an even keel.  I really hope this fades and that I can become the calm and collected person I want to be.
Triumph - my doctor noticed a healthy change in my appearance and seven pounds lost without trying. I'm losing the doughy face. ..Struggle - mood swings of a premenstrual teenaged girl. One moment I'm prancing around gleefully like Homer Simpson in The Land of Chocolate and the next moment I'm raging like Moe Szyslak getting prank-called by Bart. ..General chat - I am temporarily immobilized because there are two sleeping hefty orange tabbies on my chest. I'm being smothered by a warm purring pile of cuddles. No really and I have to pee. ..Be well everyone!
