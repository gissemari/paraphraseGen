Last summer a friend of mine told me that he had a brother who struggled with alcoholism back home in Ireland. Yesterday I found out that his brother had died after falling down a flight of stairs. ..I've fallen down flights of stairs on multiple occasions while drunk. Once I fell face-first like a chess piece being toppled onto a concrete patio floor. Only the presence of a plastic bucket placed there for God knows what reason broke my fall. And literally saved my face...My tumbles down the stairs were played for comedic effect. It *is* funny in a slapstick way to witness. But like so many of the other things that happen when we're drunk it is deadly. My education my supportive family and my job   all the reasons I convinced myself I wasn't a *real* alcoholic that I was just someone who liked his drink a bit too much at times   amounted to nothing at the moment I was falling down a flight of stairs. All I had was providence...I'm grateful every day to be sober. But today I'm especially grateful just to be alive.
