   Sitting here worn out limbs are shaking eyelids are sore muscles are aching breathing feels heavy... so so so tired .. all from .....(trying to drag this out here and failing) Muay Thai training! I know I had you going there! :-).....   Yes well one year ago I certainly would not have thought I would feel this good in myself this positive and clear-headed. I am really happy. Its been a rough ride getting here not gonna lie. The past few years of my life have been the most traumatic I've ever experienced. So much abuse so much anger hurt and sadness. I can't even describe it. But one year ago today I decided that I could not have alcohol in my life anymore because it was contributing to a downward spiral of destruction. Little by little I made improvements in my life to make things better and its a daily struggle. There is no final destination. There is no finish line. Its a daily process. But I have learned that this is actually a part of the joy of it. Each day that passes and I lay my head down to sleep at night and think to myself "I didn't drink today" ... it improves my self-confidence my self-esteem my happiness.. everything. I make mistakes just like anyone. I can be an asshole. I can be ignorant. But I didn't drink today. And that **is** something to be proud of. We are all human here and we all struggle with the same burdens but those of us who chose this life of abstinence from alcohol *do* deserve a pat on the back. Because its not fucking easy. In a world consumed with self-gratification slavery to the senses and gratification of any desire.. in a world with marketing designed to make alcohol look so goddamn cool and free of consequence .. in a world where almost all of our friends are quite actually borderline or full blown alcoholics WE ARE THE ONES WHO STAND UP AND SAY NO IN THE FACE OF IT ALL. This is a goddamn battle. We are in a motherfucking war ladies and gentlemen. And we are doing it. We are winning. If you have one day under your belt. If you have ONE HOUR under your belt and you are telling yourself "NO MORE" then you are my comrade in this battle. I want you to know that you too can do it. If you are reading this and feeling like you are too weak.. if you feel like you've only one got one day or one week sober under your belt and that demon is whispering to you that its nothing and you are going to fail.. I am here to tell you that you can do it. ......   You look yourself in the face in the mirror and you congratulate yourself on that one goddamn day. One day is a big achievement. A bunch of one days adds up to a year people. A bunch of years adds up to a lifetime. Its up to **us**. No more will we be slaves to alcohol. My mantra and something I learned in the 2 AA classes I went to once upon a time is "one day at a time". And this has gotten me through some tough times. When I start to think of the years ahead of me in my life(we won't get into some existential debate about the brevity of life here) and I start to feel daunted by it all I **STOP** and say no! .. only one day just today...I can manage that. I cannot stress this enough. Its absolutely vital to your mental well-being and strength because a lifetime(even a year) is a very daunting prospect folks. So take it easy on yourself. One day just today. You can do it. And if the day seems too long my next tip is this.. break the monotony. Whatever you are doing at that exact moment break out of it. Go outside get a walk. Put on a TV show. Do some house cleaning. Anything at all that will snap that mental loop out of your head. Stay focused and remember.. *you are in a goddamn battle for your life here* .. its no joke. And you have many comrades and supporters behind you. YOU ARE NOT ALONE. Don't let your thoughts make you feel isolated. Speaking of thoughts.. you are the master of them. Don't let them control you. You are the one in the drivers seat! As I maintained my sobriety I found myself more and more in control of my emotions and my thoughts and this was one of the biggest things I was thankful for. This one was a tricky one because it actually took a few months before I really noticed it and realized it but I am telling you.. when you get there and you feel it. Its invaluable. It really is. We don't realize what a quivering wreck of spontaneous emotion we are when we are drinking regularly..until we stop. This touches on my previous point about being in the drivers seat. In a sense its easy for me to say it now with a year behind me and perhaps some of you who might be in the early stages are wondering how the hell you can be in the drivers seat. You still feel helpless. I say this to you.. first of all positive reinforcement.. congratulate yourself each day on being sober it didn't happen by mistake. **You** fucking made it happen. ALL YOU. No one else. No *thing* else. YOU. You fucking rock. Secondly just hold on .. the clarity of emotion and thought **will come** but it does take time and you're doing it! Be positive and proactive.......   I found that developing hobbies and finding extra curricular activities to do was good for me. I joined the gym and I go there regularly. I started eating well ie. lots of whole grains fresh meat and fish taking various vitamins and supplements and so forth. I recently have started Muay Thai kickboxing. I have started watching TV shows religiously(I was never a TV person I don't even own one.. I just umm *obtain* them from the Internets) just for fun because why not? Going for walks in nature. Just random stuff to shake things up. Its important that you maintain a routine and you stick to it you don't have to do the same stuff constantly but you need some discipline in your life because you are filling a void here. Time previously spent drinking and recovering from drinking is now spare time and we know what they say about the devil and idle hands. So.. **do stuff**. Anything it doesn't matter it really doesn't. But you must keep yourself occupied and particularly in the early months until your emotions and thought processes start to come back into balance its critical. Do not sit around being mopey and doing nothing. Be active. Sometimes you will feel absolutely crap. Once again its okay. Feel your emotions don't be afraid of them. Let them go through you. Observe them and know them for what they are. Resonance of previous experience manifesting in the present. They are not the boss remember that. You are. And when they pass breathe. And breathe some more. Observe yourself. Feel yourself. In the moment. This is you. Get back to knowing yourself again. For so long we were alienated from ourselves. Yes its scary to get to know yourself again. But hey you are your own best friend and who else would you rather know this well. Forgive yourself for the wrongs of the past. We have all made mistakes. And even just now with me typing that I hesitated because of my own past and my mistakes. But if we can't forgive ourselves and move forward into a better future then the cycle of pain and regret simply continues. We have chosen to make it stop by making a decision to not drink anymore. ......   There is no secret to not drinking. You just do it. This is my point of view and others obviously may differ but in my opinion turning it into some big issue and struggle for yourself is simply giving more power to alcohol than what it deserves. You have the strength and the ability within yourself to do whatever you damn well choose. We have been taught and conditioned to give our own power away for so long whether it is to authority figures and politicians with "all the answers" or whether it is to drugs and alcohol.. anything which takes away your own personal power to change your life for the better must be seen for what it is.. disempowering and ultimately unnecessary to you in your life. Stopping drinking is about taking back control over your own life and the direction it is going. If you feel the need for support groups and so forth you will never find any argument from me in that arena but I will stress that people must recognize that is ourselves that ultimately make this choice and it is ourselves who say **NO** to that drink. No one else and nothing else. Its you. This is liberating amazing and beautiful to me. I have found great peace and comfort in the slow dawning realization that I am worthy and able to do this for myself. ......   I could keep typing but I shall try to bring this to a close of some sort. I just want to thank r/stopdrinking. I want to thank each and every one of you. I don't post on this sub as often as I should but all of you are in my thoughts on a daily basis and I am so thankful to have found this community of people. I hope I didn't rant on too long! Most of this is aimed at the person sitting there with one day one week one month under their belt and feeling that its all too much. I want you to know you can do it. Believe in yourself. Take it one day at a time. I really can't stress this one enough. One day. Just today. Don't drink today. Don't even think about tomorrow. None of us are promised it anyway. Be easy on yourself. Forgive yourself your mistakes and just make it through the day any way you can. This life isn't easy sometimes but drinking will never make any tough situation any easier it will only make it worse. You are worth it and you are well able for the challenges ahead. Life is better being sober. Its just as simple as that. It really is. I love feeling my emotions(the ups **and** the downs) I love being in control of my thoughts and my actions and taking responsibility for myself. I love knowing that perhaps I can inspire people around me that I care about to maybe in some small way make a positive change for themselves. To all my comrades out there I salute you and when the going gets tough we all have each others backs. I'm glad for that. .....Thank you all..

Wow - &lt;standing applause&gt;  Thank You for taking the time to share this. It is inspirational.   I relate to so many of these points.  It helps me confirm Im on the right path.  Going to save this one for future reads.  Though I am just getting started I can relate that this is a War.  It is not a passive low emotion endeavor.  The SOB in my head is an Adversary and he is going to loose.  There is not way that little F'er is going to win.  I am finding other things to do.  You link this to societal pressures and the billions of dollars spent on advertising to entice.  Yeah this is a war and every day sober is a victory.   Well Said.  Congratulations on One year!
