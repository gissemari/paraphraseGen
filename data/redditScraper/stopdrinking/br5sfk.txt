Literally any and All of my problems in life stem from alcohol. I try to be a good funny honest person I really do. There is nothing harder in this world than putting the bottle down. I was in the Army for 11 years even tried the deputy sheriff life for about 6 months. I have multiple DUIS. I'm awaiting Veterans Treatment Court in 2 weeks. As long as I can complete that I can hopefully start over. I've been trying to hide my drinking from everyone in my family. There are times where I'd honestly prefer to not be alive. My wife keeps finding my cans and bottles only to be left with constant broken promises of " it's the last time I swear. " She tells me that I'm making a choice by buying and drinking it every time. She's probably right I don't know. I wish it wasn't a "choice". I'd love to stop making that "choice".  Believe me I'd love to stop making that choice. My life has been a living hell thanks to alcohol. The moments when I can not drink alcohol for maybe a week at a time life is great it couldn't be better. My constant relapses are a living hell. I'm VA disability connected for multiple things to include PTSD. I'm sick and tired of letting everyone down I hate who I am because of it and I wish it was easy to stop making that "choice".

I read this book high price by Carl hart. Check it out. You might find it interesting. Also dont do this for anyone else but yourself. Sure you're letting other people down. But you've gotta do it for yourself. Good luck man. Get back to it.
Hey man hang in there!   Your wife doesn't understand that you're addicted to a fucked up substance that is really hard to quit.  Nobody understands unless they have been addicted themselves.  She just probably doesn't understand and the last thing you need to do is feel ashamed.  You're only human.  ..Now I don't know if you have gotten help for alcohol or your PTSD but there's absolutely no shame in it.  When I quit I needed therapy to get over my anxiety problems.  I'm still in therapy...its the best thing I ever did.  I wish I had gotten help dealing with my baggage years ago.  I also talked to my doctor and got on some medication which helped in those first couple months.  I've read some really great books on mindfulness which has helped a ton.  The Mindful Way Through Depression is a good read and teaches some good techniques on how to be mindful.  Also another book called "Daring Greatly" which talks all about how fucked up shame is...and how you can combat shame with being Vulnerable.  I highly recommend giving it a read.  The author has a couple good synopsis Ted talks you might find interesting...[https://www.ted.com/talks/brene\_brown\_on\_vulnerability?language=en](https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability?language=en)..[https://www.ted.com/talks/brene\_brown\_listening\_to\_shame](https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_listening_to_shame)..&amp;#x200B;..Anyway just being here posting is a step in the right direction man.  Hang in there one day at a time. IWNDWYT
I think most of us have quit over and over again and woke up at the starting line. It's a weird auto pilot when you head back to the store for more. The voice in your head gets drowned out by primal urge to go. ..Every time I fail I realize again that I never filled the empty space with anything. I think that's pretty important. This time around I'm playing a lot of music and writing and working towards something. I'm getting back to the gym and going to AA meetings. Being bored and alone is my worst enemy. You're still on the right track. You're here and you know that this thing in your life is the reason you keep backtracking. So you're in a great spot to keep moving forward.
Hey Brother - I'm very similar. I'm 70% with some of that related to PTSD. I've struggled with alcohol since my last deployment in 2005. I've never been able to go to therapy or seek treatment (for the PTSD) and I know I should but it's just not in my nature. I'm working up to it finally but I wasn't even willing to consider it that is until I quit drinking. ..One thing that I can say that helped me (this is just me I'm only sharing my experience) was to own up to the issue. I used to blame alcohol for all of my problems. But after hitting bottom and doing some serious introspection I realized that alcohol isn't the problem I AM the problem. Alcohol was just a crutch and an excuse. I need to fix what's wrong with me... What's really causing my anxiety unhappiness and desire to escape...That said I've finally scheduled an appointment to speak with a therapist. Granted its over the phone... But hey baby steps right?..IWNDWYT. Hang in there.
