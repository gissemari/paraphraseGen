I've been trying to live sober for the past eight years and I've been failing at it. I had not had a drink since January when last week I slipped up and got drunk. This past year I've been relying on kratom a couple times a week as an alternative to alcohol well the DEA banned it so now I'm back at square one. I guess I was scared and felt like I needed something. I didn't really enjoy drinking like I thought I would. It made me feel sick and it wasn't fun so I haven't returned to it. ..I have huge problems with depression and wanting to self medicate that. I am on anti-depressants right now but It's been a struggle to find something that works. I have a counselor I've been to smart meetings and AA more times than I can count. I practice meditation and lately I've been exercising. I just want to find some peace in sobriety. It's been such a long hard road and it isn't getting any easier. I don't expect life to be perfect all of time but it's not supposed to be this hard is it? I don't want to give up the amount of alcohol I can drink is dangerous and it will kill me. But it's hard because I feel like I'm failing at this.

I understand your your dilema. I'm kind of new to acknowledging I have a problem..but I just wanted to let you know I read you post and my heart goes out to you. It isn't easy but from what I saw at my meeting and have read it is doable. 
Glad you're here...I have compassion for your struggles...I see you experience depression.  While I don't have a solution a contributing factor is that alcohol **is** a depressant.  I guess you know that already...What are your choices?
I'm sorry for your struggles. I fight this battle one day at a time. Some days are harder than others...On this day I will not drink with you.
