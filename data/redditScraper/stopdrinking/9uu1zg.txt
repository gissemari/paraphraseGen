I was six days sober and in the midst of an initial withdrawal after years of heavy drinking. Last night I binged and almost ended up in the hospital. ..Will withdrawal start all over again or be milder? Anyone have experience?

Here for answers this also happened to me.
From what my doc has said a day or two wouldn't make me receive dangerous withdrawals but that was after I'd been sober for a few weeks not 6 days...You're still gonna get some after drinking from my experience. 
I would seek medical advice just to be sure. 
The only thing that any one of us can do is to tell you to see a doctor. The internet is not a good source of medical information and withdrawal can be dangerous even deadly. We have removed your post and hope you'll seek medical support.
