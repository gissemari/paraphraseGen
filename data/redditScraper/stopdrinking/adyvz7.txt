Evenin' all after getting a decent sleep last night today has been much better. Finally seeing glimpses of the benefits and why I will never go back to boozing. For anyone struggling or not at day 6 yet - keep going! It's gonna be worth it!! IWNDWYT

How great is good sleep? One of the best things about sobriety. Stay strong.
