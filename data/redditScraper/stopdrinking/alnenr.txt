Hello  ...I'm a 24F I had a long term romantic partner whom I lived with for a year who suffered extreme alocholism and suicidal attempts. I spent a year financially supporting him his daughter and myself while working full time and starting a graduate school program.  .Finally after multiple detox attempts and my own mental health deteriorating because of my Anxiety Disorder I decided it wasn't healthy for us to be together. I saw how much the alcohol affected him myself his family his daughter.  ...Every since that relationship drinking wine in the evenings have been my coping mechanism to not process all of the overwhelming emotions guilt anxiety and boredom that come with my thoughts. After dating a second partner I realized was exhibiting all of the traits of the first and examining my own drinking habits I recently ended things with that partner recognizing I cannot help another before I am in a good mental place.  ...This weekend after about 1.5-2L of wine every night for months I got so sick I had to rush to the doctor for a rupture in my stomach lining due to being so ill. It was my wake up call for needing to stop to get my life back on track. My doctor put me on Ativan and wants weekly check-ins.  Tonight Day 3 I had an emotional breakdown earlier seemingly out of nowhere. Guilt overwhelming shame worry stress everything I'd been suppressing the last few months just flooded out. I think I needed that catharsis. After this emotional breakdown i drove down to the store I bought a bottle of wine -- knowing this used to almost always make me feel better -- but then i felt ashamed when I returned home I was ashamed that I'd failed I gave in why was I so weak? Why did I even really feel like I needed it?    ...I opened the wine. I took two sips and then I put it away. I felt wrong I felt shame I felt like sipping it reminded me of the change in how I felt this morning was (I would lose that light relaxed wake up feel sick and depressed). My anxiety frequently gets the better of me. So I put down the wine but I was just more anxious that I'd slipped at all...I am currently struggling with the guilt over having slipped at all while trying to see that in a few days that is still 90% less than I have had in months. I have had my first two nights going to bed with clear thoughts I have spent the first few days not controlled by hungover slugishness or crippling anxiety and acid reflux in the morning.  ...I'm here to see if any one else lost needs someone to talk to or alternate perspectives on what is going on? I don't beat myself up over a slip up but i also want to be grounded in realism.   ...Any tips thoughts or advice?  ...&amp;#x200B;

Amazing job on not drinking that wine.  Really that took a lot of strength....I found a nice comment on reddit a few days ago that you can apply to lots of situations.  'The only person you should compare yourself with is Yesterday You'.    I really love this mantra.  You just have to be slightly better than yesterday that's it!  It could be the absolute tiniest thing....How about tomorrow you can feel less guilt than you did today.  Or maybe listen to an anxiety podcast or some guided meditation on youtube?  Tomorrow you will be better than you are today.
I tried to quit on my own about a hundred times. That number may sound inflated for dramatic effect but keep in mind that it was over more than thirty years. I'd have a day or two here a week or two there sometimes a few months but always wound up back where I'd started. When I finally realized that it was stronger and smarter than me I stopped fighting and found some help. I started with SMART psychiatry and Antabuse then added in AA and Refuge Recovery. Sitting and talking with people who understand my problem was a big help to me. If there are no convenient recovery meetings near you they're available online.
