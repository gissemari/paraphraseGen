Still feeling like crap but I've made apologies to those I hurt during my bender yesterday. I'm still so ashamed but the knot in my stomach has loosened up a little bit. .The truth is that I've been having a particularly rough time lately. I'm overwhelmed and just super unhappy with myself. I'm an alcoholic and an addict. I'm in love with these substances but I know that this path that I'm on is one that doesn't end happily. I can't talk to my family about how serious my issues are because I would scare them. .I've always struggled with addiction and my family has been there to help me. In the peak of my drinking I would disappear for days at a time and they still get paranoid when I don't answer my phone. Right now they all think that I'm doing well and getting passed these issues but I'm progressively getting worse. I had 8 months drug free (not including alcohol) but I relapsed in September. Now it's becoming a regular part of my life again and I know that if I don't do something about this soon this is the relapse that I won't come back from..This has turned into a vent session which I apologize for. I guess that I just needed to get this off of my chest. I'm ready to commit to being sober. I'm ready to go to meetings regularly and maybe even see a doctor. This is it. It has to be..Thanks for reading and wishing the best for you all.

Welcome back! I have my share of relapses. And I hate that on the Daily Check In I can't say "sober today" because other addictions still have me "by the short hairs" but at least I can say I will/have not drink/drank today. Baby steps here. I would love to take it on leaps and bounds but it doesn't work for me. One step at a time for this girl... which I also despise that saying cuz it sounds so cliche but it is none the less so true.

I wish you strengthened peace; lean on your sober friends in here and any where you can find them...I felt like crap at the beginning too; I also had PAWS (post-acute withdrawal syndrome) for awhile which sucked BIG-time. But keep at it we are all here for you. We've been there and we all know that we can  never never ever turn our let our guard down on alcohol again. It is a seductive cunning and vicious "frienemy." It took me some relapses before I started seeing doctors to get over some of my major hurdles so that I could "get my feet under me" to be able to walk away from the booze......as they say one day at a time! ..Keep going...day one is a beautiful start:)
