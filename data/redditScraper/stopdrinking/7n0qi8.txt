Does anybody who struggles with maintaining sobriety/is trying sobriety for the first time (like me) have a certain mantra they use at the moment in which they're contemplating reaching for a drink? ..It doesn't have to be pithy profound or complex; I only ask because I seem to be able to resist drinking right up until this critical juncture. ..Thank you

I play the tape forward: will this drink be worth the feelings of worthlessness and disappointment? How terrible will I feel in the morning? What rubbish will I say when I'm drinking that I'll regret and feel ashamed about?  ..If that doesn't help I'd go to bed! Don't want a drink when I'm in bed. Bit dramatic but helped me out in the first couple of months!
"Don't drink today". Sounds boring and silly but that's mine. After a hard day thinking about just having a drink. I think that. Tomorrow I don't care about worry about that then. But I can do the next few hours. Make dinner go for a run. I can drink tomorrow if I really want but I won't today. Not tonight. I'll play some zelda. ..I tell myself that every day. Over time the days built up. Until I don't really think about it anymore which I never thought would happen but glad it has. 
When urges/cravings hit that hard I would step back from "just for today" and change to "for the next 10 minutes I won't drink"... Keep repeating until the urge subsides. 
I hanged my phone unlock code to SS4(my intitials). It's my constant reminder to stay sober for myself. ..It sounds stupid but I also will mediate and sort of chant to myself "stay sober for -" and run through the names of people I love. So mom dad fianc  brother etc.
