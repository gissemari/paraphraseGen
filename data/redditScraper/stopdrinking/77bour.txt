So I have gone a month before without a drink but never much more than that.  So far I haven't had many cravings and things are going well.  Right now I honestly don't see myself relapsing and I am surprised how easy it has been.  I just need to stay vigilant and never let my guard down.  Thanks to everyone on SD for the advice and success stories to keep me going.

I've been feeling similar. It hasn't been THAT hard  but I'm definitely keeping my guard up too. I worry about being over confident. ..
