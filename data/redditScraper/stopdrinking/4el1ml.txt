Years and years of on again  off again binge drinkinggot my first DUI last October and swore I wouldn't drink after thatwent 100 days with the help of SD and that memory. then another relapse got back to   40 days. now I am working on rebuilding again but I am struggling again forgetting the lessons of last October forgetting the threatsforgetting the law. The question is why???  why do we continue to make the wrong choices knowing what can happen to us..EDIT..Much thanks for comments thoughtful and focused on recovery..

Alcoholism like heart disease like diabetes--is a CHRONIC disease.  We are NOT responsible for the genetic pre-disposition or even the early onset of the disease but we ARE responsible for treatment.  That in a nutshell is all there is.  I spent too many years complicating this by theories and speculation and pop psychology but plain and simple I needed to make a daily decision not to drink + pursue recovery resources.  That's always what the [Baby Steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) represent for me: taking responsibility for my recovery!
&gt; why do we continue to make the wrong choices knowing what can happen to us...For me I think some of the reason I kept drinking was that I kept looking to people with worse problems to rationalize own addiction. I knew people who had drank themselves to death had horrible accidents and maimed themselves and others lost their jobs become homeless. Sure I was well on my way to all of the above had lost relationships and was fat and mentally and physically ill but I was not as bad as "X".... Yet...I finally realized that I should not be comparing my life to the worst addicts I should instead look at how people without my problems were living. This opened up a whole new world to me. As the months went by and I began looking backwards at my my old life it became clearer how deluded I really was. Alcohol had never done me any favors had never benefited me at all..
Echo u/ThreeBlurryDecades on the "Yets".  That's the "why" for me.  My drinking mind will justify every time.  It whispers to me.  ..Echo u/coolcrosby on the "what" which is Treatment!  I'm responsible for  the treatment.   I actually have type-2 diabetes and I'm responsible for the Treatment.  ..Similarly with my Sobriety.  I have to continue my regimen.  Daily reflection (like measuring my glucose); mindfulness (conscious of my choices and behaviors/intake); going to meetings (continuing to grow my knowledge of the disease and tools available  to me); fellowship (staying connected with similar people who understand what I'm going through); and service (helping others who may be just starting out or are struggling with staying on track)...I'm responsible for the Treatment!..Do you have a regimen?
