Good morning/afternoon/evening!   ..*Theme:* Thriving    ..*Today's Quote*:  **"My mission in life is not merely to survive but to thrive; and to do so with some passion some compassion some humor and some style."**    ..  [Maya Angelou] (http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/m/mayaangelo634520.html)    ..*What I get from it*:  There have been times when I probably could have been called a "functional alcoholic."  If you define "functional" as keeping a job and avoiding arrest that was me.    ..But if you told me as a kid that one day I would have a job and not get arrested I wouldn't be pumped.  Since getting sober I've seen that those things that made me functional are only there to support the other cool stuff that life has to offer.  I wouldn't say I'm thriving these days but it feels good to aim for it rather than merely struggling to survive through another day.  I can still laugh on a bad day.     .   .Have a great day!

Love Maya. Thanks for sharing.
Maya will always have a special place in my heart.  Awesome and empowering quote as was she.
Love it!
I am personally lacking a "mission statement" but if I was to make one I think it would have most these elements. Happy Tuesday!
Great post!  Thanks.
