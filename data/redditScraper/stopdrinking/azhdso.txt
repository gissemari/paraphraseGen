I went to a wilderness therapy center and got 3 months sober then within two hours of leaving it to go to my aftercare in another state I got drunk at the airport.. Almost got kicked out but they were kind enough to let me stay. I felt ashamed for relapsing but I'm proud of myself for jumping back into it.

Well done you are stronger and wiser. I believe this. If I may ask what were the steps that led you to the drinking? And what is the wilderness therapy like?

Similarly I made it 3 months then fell back into old habits.  I figure if I can make it 3 months once no reason I can't repeat it and make it even longer this time.  Bet you can too.  Wish you well on your journey.  I will not drink with you today.
