Longtime lurker (this is a new account BTW).  I quit for almost 3 months.  I never really count days because I don't even want to have that minimal link to the past.  I found this site and realized that everything I was experiencing was not unique to me.  I found comfort in that.  I was also a little disappointed to find out I was not unique.  Not a unique delicate flower.  But that is okay.  One of the things I read that really hit home was on a post I read a while back.  Summary:  I have always blamed my failures on alcohol.  I am terrified that I will stop drinking and still fail.  Then I have to blame myself. .Anywho I relapsed several months ago after I witnessed a shooting death.  Close up.  It brought back memories that I thought I had filed away and put in deep storage.  Not deep enough apparently.  I have not been sober since.  But That is about to change. I did it once.  I can do it again.  There is not really any point to this post except that if I write it down and share it it becomes real.  Tangible.  A written promise to myself.  Thanks for indulging me.  Unfortunately I don't get on Reddit that often but I will make the most of it when I do..

Welcome and hello /u/SoMuchForThatIdea. I'm glad you're here. I realized that in order to stay sober it was important to get treatment for trauma I'd experienced. I hope you will do so too. Therapy treatment and AA saved my life one day at a time.
