I attended my third AA meeting today and asked one of the guys I know there to sponsor me. He told me that if I didn't waste his time he wouldn't waste mine. I told him I wouldn't ask if I wasn't all in. We're all gonna make it. Anyone that is out there struggling stay strong. There is support and you CAN do it!

How wonderful to hear that you are surrounding yourself with a good safetynet. It'll surely help you!
My sponsor read out loud to me from the Big Book for like 30 minutes.  I felt loved after that.
