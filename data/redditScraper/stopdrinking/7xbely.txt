My buddy sent me a text today "hey are you still doing good? Staying sober and sticking to the gym?" I was so happy to let him know that I was still in this sober. He is the only friend I have that has never had a drop of alcohol nor has tried any drugs. (While I struggle with both) I admire the kid. It's been fantastic feeling clear headed for once in my adult life. I went from using the snow as an excuse to stay home and get trashed to using it as an excuse for not going to the gym. Lot of snow in Michigan lately so I've been messing around on the guitar and reading the book Choke. The sun is shining and life is good.

Congrats!!  I'm in MI also and it's tough sometimes with the lack of sun... Keep up the good work. I'm thinking of taking guitar lessons starting next week....Good luck my friend. You can do this!!
Glad you have a friend like this in sobriety! IWNDWYT 
You are YOU. If you are like me you feel this weird feeling. It is a mix of pride confidence and lack of some guilt and self sorrow.  It is an amazing feeling. Congratulations. I am proud of you and you deserve to be proud of yourself!  
Your friend is priceless. It's good to have someone who truly cares enough to check in on you. Congrats. I'm in Chicago so I think we both got the same snow storm over the weekend.. depending on where you are. 35 days till spring. Good luck with everything. I will not drink with you today.

Choke is so good. Palahniuk is a great story teller. I have enjoyed all his books.
