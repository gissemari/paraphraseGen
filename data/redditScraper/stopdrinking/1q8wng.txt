Woke up at 5 to my daughter telling me she had a sore throat. Got her squared away and tried to go back to sleep but couldn't- dammit! Stomped out of bed and took the dog for a walk saw a beautiful sunrise. No hangover no "what did i do last night". Now i'm in a better mood. Still struggling with a lot of guilt. Have a fun sober 3 day weekend planned though. Day 4 here I come!

A sober three day weekend sounds great! I hope you have fun!
Guilt is normal but also a waste of energy. There's nothing we can do about the past. Saying "I'm sorry" at this point is also a waste because my apologies were a broken record. In early sobriety we have no credibility. Apologies and amends are only appropriate and effective after a lengthy period of solid sobriety. Only then do we become believable. It takes a long time to rebuild trust. ..The best thing you can do is stay sober today and work on personal growth. A counselor or support group is very helpful in this regard because it is difficult to get honest perspective from just our own point of view about ourselves. No matter how smart or intuitive we think we are external feedback from a professional is valuable. ..Enjoy the rest of the weekend.
