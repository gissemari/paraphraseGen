Winter solstice to Spring Equinox and not a drop to drink. ..Things had gotten really bad. 3 detoxes in 2 years and many many relapses that almost sent me back- I spent whole weeks at a time  in bed with a bottle by my side not knowing day from night and only sobering up enough to be in good enough shape to get back to the liquor store. I white knuckled my way through many withdrawals. My job is long gone but somehow my wife stuck around. ..3 months sober feels good. I can think straight and it's a tough road ahead to put the pieces back together but one step at a time. ..

Congrats! First 3 months were the hardest for me.  Every day is a little easier now.
