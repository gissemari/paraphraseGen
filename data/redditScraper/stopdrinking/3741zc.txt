I'm only on day 5 of being sober but it's the longest I've intentionally gone in years and it feels great! I've got a clear head and lot's of energy. Had a bit of struggle last evening as my wife was out of town at a bachelorette party and it would have been so normal and easy to pick up a 12 pack and zone out on the couch. But now it's Sunday morning and I feel great and ironically it's my wife on the couch feeling the booze from last night. She's not a heavy drinker so no issues there it just feels good to be on the other side of things for once! ..I guess this is my little introduction to SD and I hope to be an active and contributing member of this sub from here on out! Here's to the long weekend with no booze and taking each day at a time.

Welcome!  I'm a relative newcomer myself and the site has been very helpful to me.  Indeed it was a post on this site that encouraged me to take the first step.  If you are on day 5 you are on the way.  Best wishes and have a great holiday!
Welcome. One day at a time worked for me. Good luck!
Nice!
Congrats. Glad you are here.
Congrats! Welcome to the SD party. This was my first full weekend as well... felt so odd Friday night not loading up on the usual stuff on the way home. Keep strong! I will join you today in not drinking.
