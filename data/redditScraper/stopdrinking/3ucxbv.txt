Today is the first time I woke up not sick on Thanksgiving for the first time I can remember. I'm not smiling because I'm supposed to but because I genuinely want to. I absolutely love this feeling and I wouldn't trade it for the world. I hope all of you are having a great Thanksgiving. To those struggling stay strong. It really gets better.

Congrats! That's great news!! 
It's so worth it isn't it? I was just thinking about a long-ago Thanksgiving when my brother and I stayed up all night drinking the godawfulest (I'm southern. Can't help it.) Arkansas wine. Both of our digestive tracts were doing cartwheels all the next day. Today we both felt great. Hang in there everybody.
