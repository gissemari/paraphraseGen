My dad is still here - he'll be here a few more days and has been drinking (brought beer & wine with him) - not to wretched excess which is good...I'm doing fine as far as that goes - no close calls or struggles - although I expected there might be. I had a very stressful day today but the great thing is that when I felt the stress I craved quiet and a calm space - things that would actually *help* with relieving the stress not alcohol which would have only added to it. ..I've got a couple more days of this unexpected visit to get through. May is always a busy month for me and this visit just piled more on. I'm really looking forward to stringing together a couple of days of pure rest in a few weeks. I'm going to buy my son the new Wii U Donkey Kong game for his birthday and will probably spend some of that rest time playing that with him. :)

Sounds like you are handling it well.  Hang in there and rest &amp; relaxation will be here in no time (especially when you are busy - time flies).  Good luck.
You are doing fine double-D--you got this pal!
Thanks for the good-news update.
