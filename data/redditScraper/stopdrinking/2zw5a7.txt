Welp at three weeks again. That's a good start. Honestly I'm staying sober but I'm struggling with sobriety. I know it's for the best. I know I need to stay sober. I don't actually want to drink not at all. But part of me wants to be drunk.

Oh I know that feeling!  But I still remember what it is to be too drunk to have days pass by without enjoying them because I'm relatively stuporous to be isolated by my drinking and to alienate people by my drunken actions.  
I would have been drunk too had it not been for the support of a therapist and involvement in AA. Maybe you like most of us need more support.
