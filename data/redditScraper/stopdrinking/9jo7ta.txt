NOTE:..I wrote the following paragraphs in a journal at about 2:45 AM today.  I am totally sober right now but I did have to do a badge reset today...I've been reluctant to make any long posts on SD yet \[SD has been my FIRST EVER significant foray into social media\] but I felt like this narrative was important (in terms of insight into *why* I drink which I think I have to understand in order to *stop* drinking) and that maybe sharing it with all of you fellow sobernauts might help me to process everything...I appreciate any and all (constructive) feedback.  But no one has to reply; maybe I'll just feel better knowing that someone else may have read my thoughts...===================================================================================================..I made it all day w/o drinking despite the lost cat drama and stress (Fiona aka  Fi  aka Baby Girl). Probably managed it because I was out virtually all f'ing day from 6:30 AM (9/27)  til 1:30 AM stuffing  Lost Cat  flyers in mailboxes and hanging posters. I didn't use RunKeeper but I know that I covered at least 20 miles b/c of all of the zigzagging and having to re-walk the same roads a couple of times when I ran out of flyers and had to reload. I took a quick break to eat a PBJ sandwich and print more  Lost Cat  flyers/posters. Then I took another  break  from about 8 PM to 11:20 PM to eat a plate of pasta and complete the assignment that was due at 11:59 PM (online Bachelor's degree program) for my forensic accounting class. Bob (father-in-law) put Theresa (Bob's mother) to bed then I told him I would be going out shortly to set up the new wildlife cameras (hoping to spot Fi so that we could confirm that she's still in the area) and walk the immediate neighborhood tossing some of Max and Toothless's used cat litter into the woods along the edge of the road in hopes that Fi would follow the scent trail home.  You're going out *now*?  Bob said sounding totally disgusted that I hadn't gone out at 10 PM like he had suggested. I reminded him that I had been working on an assignment that was due by midnight. Apparently the 20+ miles I had covered during the day (after sleeping less than four hours the previous night) wasn't enough effort yet...I know that Bob just forgot or else hadn't heard me say that I was doing schoolwork that had to be turned in that night but I already felt so shitty because I hadn't *fixed everything* yet (Fiona was still missing dammit)...So I struggled with the two new cameras for maybe 45 minutes before I was confident that they were set up and aimed well enough then I scattered the cat doo through the woods behind our house leading down the hill toward Keith Lane where the scent tracking dog seemed to have found her trail the day before. I tried to be careful not to get too close to the house on Keith's backyard though since apparently the wife there had called the cops on my husband and the dog handler or me (we're not sure exactly when she called them). I also went up our street scattering litter. I thought I saw a person standing in a doorway across the street at one point but dismissed it as either a Halloween decoration or a figment of my overtired imagination. I skulked around for a moment or two trying to find the opening to the drainage culvert to put some litter there (we know our cats sometimes travel through those tunnels) and when I looked up again after I saw that there definitely was a man peering at me from the doorway. I thought  Wicked awesome I might have *two* neighbors call the cops on me within like 16 hours because I'm trying to find my Baby Girl. ..Point is I have been killing myself since Tuesday trying to do everything possible to bring Fi home When I finally called it quits at 1:30 AM I desperately wanted to rest. And yet I felt so horribly guilty and ashamed *for wanting to rest* that I just couldn't let myself.  Hell I don't *deserve* rest yet Fi's still out there somewhere!  my brain shouted...And *that* is when I had to drink. Alcohol might help me get to a place where I could let myself rest without the guilt and shame keeping me awake. That guilt shame and anxiety would force me to keep pushing myself until everything was okay; but I just couldn't anymore. ( The fuck you can't!  shouted [R.

----------immediate responses--------

Alcohol is never the only solution. I know how a missing pet feels. But after searching all day you did deserve to rest. You need to wake up clear headed and come up with a plan to find your cat.
 I can relate to that feeling a bit. It's a form of self-sabotage. Often drinking for me became a way of accelerating the negative aspects of myself/my life to  get it over with  in a twisted kind of way. When you get into a depressive cycle the brain can prioritize feeling bad over getting better. It's a feedback loop or a confirmation bias...The reality is that whatever our goal is we are much better able to achieve it when we are well healthy rested sober. For myself self-sabotage is never about not deserving  the break  it's about feeling that I don't deserve the happiness (or other good things) that achieving the goal would bring. So I would punish myself by making it harder or impossible to achieve my goals...It's just an excuse though. It's driven by fear. The  need  for alcohol is the brain trying to recreate the negative feelings that seems to justify our unhappiness...I hope you find Fiona soon!
