I'm strictly a mobile user so I can't see my star but it should say 6 months! ..Things are great so far and this remains the best decision I've ever made in my life. This post is going to be brief but let me say that 6 months feels like 5 years ago and for anybody struggling out there just remember that if you take it one day at a time you'll creep up on 6 months or a year before you know it. It happens fast but it feels slow (if that makes any sense). ..I'm just checkin in on ya! Hope everyone else is doing great this crazy weekend!

Congrats on 6 months! I'm glad you are headed on a good path ;)
Congratulations!!..Your star is awesome take my word for it. 
Congratulations on 6 months and thank you so much for posting and inspiring people early in recovery and people with lots of recovery time. I found the first 6 months to be absolutely crazy what was your experience?..Six months is a great amount of sober time. You have a lot to be proud of! In my opinion you got through the really really really hard times of kicking this poison. I also found that my first year of sobriety had a lot of ups and downs that have stabilized a little bit. So I wish you even more success in the future!
It's Shining Brightly!
Congratulations on 6 months! Your star is shining brightly looking beautiful! :)
Am I the only mobile user who doesn't use the mobile view? It means I'm zooming in and out a lot but I can see your star! Congrats!!
