Hello Everyone! ..I've started to notice a lot of people posting about not felling comfortable at AA/NA mettings because of the "Higher Power" part of the program. There is another proven process that I wanted to bring to light for those who struggle with this. ..Its called [LifeRing.] (http://lifering.org/) ..Heres a snippet from the website:  *LifeRing Secular Recovery is an abstinence-based worldwide network of people who are choosing to live in recovery from alcohol and other drugs. We encourage individuals to build their own personal recovery programs based on three principles: sobriety secularity and self-direction.*..I hope this helps some of you looking for other options!

If anyone is looking for alternatives [we have a FAQ that lists a few other programs](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index#wiki_resources_and_groups)
Read We Agnostics in TBB.
I've been going to SMART meetings (Self Management And Recovery Training). It's totally secular and has been very helpful for me.
I ditched AA after a while because the "elders" recommended that I leave my wife because she wanted me to drink again. I can understand why she wanted it she thought I had control over it (and who knows? maybe I do? but not *now*) and I got disgusted with my home group. I went over a year got my brass coin reset after a small slip-up and am just doing my thing.. .I stick to SMART now. . .It has nothing to do with a higher power. That as a UU I can accept.. .It's the dogma and the politics and the self-righteousness of AA that I couldn't take any longer. . .

Smart Recovery its based on rational Emotiv Behavioral Therapy which is peer reviewed empirical science driven cognitive behavioral science. You can do it without the meetings if you want I'd suggest "3 minute therapy" as an easy read for an introduction.
I downloaded a workbook that helps deal with relapse and recovery. It's helped me see myself in a very different way and brings no higher power into it unless you want it to. It focuses on the mental physical and emotional ways we became addicted. You are forced to look at when you had your first drink the triggers what you want from life and what you think your plan should be. It also offers understanding of how the people around you dealing with your addiction and to "not let it get to you". You make your own 3 month plan and if you work with someone you trust to help you you then have accountability. It's called Make Your Last Relapse YOUR LAST! I'm working on it now and I'm making good progress(so far) and see things a little differently now. Support groups are wonderful but sometimes I can't make them and then the AA 'friends' find me and think I skipped because I'm feeling over confident or went on a binge when in reality I was at work. It put more pressure and anxiety on me to go to the meetings than work with my family through this time. It's made a world of difference. This is my first week in a LOOOONG time.
