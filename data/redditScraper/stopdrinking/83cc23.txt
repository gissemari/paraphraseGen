[Background].I'm a 21M whose been drinking recreationally for about 4 years and i've recently become terrified of what it might be doing to my body. When I started drinking I would drink copious amounts of anything me and my friends could get our hands about two or three times a month. I think I developed a problem at age 19 when I began drinking 6 12oz beers nearly every night after work (about 4-5 times a week). Since the beginning of 2018 I've been drinking 5 or 6 16oz cans nearly every night. I was only able to go 4 consecutive weeks without using but slowly got back into my habit of drinking a 6 pack every night. ..[My Problem].This past New Years Eve I drank way to much beer and experienced some very terrible alcohol poisoning that very night. The next day when I went to use the bathroom I shit out about a teaspoon worth of blood in one sitting. The bleeding proceeded for 2 days until it stopped. I was (and still am) terrified. I refrained from drinking for 4 weeks until I relapsed. After a trip to 3 different General Physicians and a Gastroenterologist I was told I have a slightly raised liver enzyme count and acid reflux. The bleeding was result of a fissure caused by severe dehydration and straining. Im certain these are all due to my alcohol consumption but I dont know how to stop or what I can do to help myself. ..[My Question].Can anyone here give me some advice on what I should  do to better my self and take control of my life and wellbeing? I never used to care about my health but now im looking to start a family with and marry my Girlfriend and I have alot to look forward too. I want to be there for her for as long as possible and I know alcohol is only gonna make me even more unhealthy. ..TL;DR .I wanna get clean and start a family but im struggling and could really use some advice....
