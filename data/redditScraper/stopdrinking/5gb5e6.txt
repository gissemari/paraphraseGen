I'm 37 years old.  I have been trying to get sober for 10 years.  I have done counseling medication outpatient rehab AA read countless books all of it.  *Somehow* I have been able to maintain a professional career and avoid being arrested or placed in the hospital.  I don't think I will avoid these things much longer.....I string together a few sober days but bounce right back to alcohol.  And the reason I'm writing this now is my alcoholic behavior has gotten worse.  It's gotten scarier.  For years I could sort of fake being in command but recently I've exhibited a total loss of control.  Like I'm a completely different person...Something happened last night.  I went to visit family about 45 minutes away for a dinner.  This is a yearly event and I have been drunk/stupid at these events in the past and I was looking forward to being sober.  Like I had genuinely eyed this specific event to be sober and present.  To help sort of increase my accountability I invited my best friend to come along who knows about my struggles.  I offered to drive in an additional way to increase accountability.  When I arrived at his house he went to get a bottle of wine to bring to the dinner and I noticed a vodka bottle in his cabinet. (He's not a big drinker *at all* but does drink).  I'm sober though.  And I'm driving.  And I'm going to see family.  And this is an event I specifically planned to be sober for.  And I'd like to repeat... I'm driving...I take that bottle and drink as much as I can in the 4-5 seconds I have.  ..**WHAT. IN. THE. FUCK.**..As alcoholics I think we all know that this moment was essentially the end of it for me.  I drive down seemingly ok and upon arrival I am offered bourbon.  And I do this odd thing where I explain I'm driving but also accept it.  And proceed to pour myself more and more as the evening progresses and by the end of the night as things get fuzzy the host is asking me if I'm really ok to drive.  The rest is... blurry.  I make it about 3 blocks on the drive back before my friend notices something is very wrong.  I pull over and he takes over the wheel.  I blame some "medication" I'm on...And that's it.....Despite years and years of tremendous fuck ups it's this one that is uniquely horrifying.  I am used to hurting me.  I have been abusing myself for well over a decade with alcohol.  I have let alcohol beat the shit out of me... and sadly come to accept it.  But in this occasion against 100% of my intention I put my best friend in danger.  And I put every single person on that road in danger.  Real harmful serious potentially fatal danger.  *That* is not me...I'm a 37 year old man.  And I'm crying as I write this because I'm somewhere between scared and shamed and hopeless and sick.  Like I don't know what's happened to me but it feels like I have completely lost control and I can't get it back.  It's not just taking me down anymore it's taking my loved ones along with it.  ..I've been fighting this battle for so so long and I keep losing.  I can't consume alcohol safely - period.  I can't.  But at the same time it is everywhere I turn.  I have always felt resistant to the notion of living a life where my sobriety comes above all else.  I've hated that concept.  It doesn't sound like "living" at all to me it feels like exhaustive resistance until the day I die.  But I'm coming to the realization that not just for myself but for the safety of others that may be my only option.  And since I've sucked so bad at achieving anything close to it... I'm terrified. ..I'm sorry to everyone.

There's nothing to apologize for. I'm glad you're here. What does putting your sobriety first look for you? What are some things you can do today to demonstrate that you're ready to make a change? 
That sounds horrible.   I am 37 also - and have also managed to not get arrested/dead yet.  I am also a chronic relapser - 1-3 weeks sober drink repeat.  My therapist suggested that there are two areas I should focus on: Accountability and Support - whichever one is lacking is the one I need to put emphasis on to turn this around.  ..Take care - and avoid the bar if you can.  Hugs! 
The scariest part of my alcoholism was when I was doing things while mentally screaming at myself to stop. It was like I was one of those marionette puppets with the strings moving me.  Into the liquor store I'd go screaming silently for my legs to stop to turn my body around...You list all of the things you've tried (rehab AA etc). Maybe you're ready to try them again with a different frame of mind?  I had to figure out that I needed to do the work rather than expect something to fix me.
I think fear is the ingredient that helps us protect ourselves. I bet it led most everyone here to open their eyes that somthing was wrong. My fears of what alcohol has or will do if I continue are many. Some the same as yours.  *Setting out not to drink and doing it anyway. * buzzed driving .... ( guilty). My health then became a fear. *Heart palpitations *stomach problems... Fear is actually our friend. We need to listen to our friend and honor its warnings. Then I think pride will replace that fear. I wont drink with you today!!!  
I think a lot of us here have done the same things you have. I know the shame and hopelessness well and that's what finally brought me here. Yes the thought of staying sober for the rest of your life is exhausting and daunting so only worry about not drinking today. ..You *can* get control back. You know you have a problem and are seeking help. If you cannot avoid the bar tonight think of how relieved and alive you will feel waking up sober tomorrow. I tell you there's nothing like it!  To get through the evening get a coke or a club soda with lime in a fancy glass and have as many of those as you like. ..You only have to forgo one drink...the first one. 
I'm your age bud and in a similar boat.  So first.. *bro-hug*..Take a step back and just state to yourself that --- It's a disease.  We both have a chronic condition.  I know full well the thought process that happens when you pull back on the throttle a bit and think "Ok I got this!"  But we don't.  We never will.  And you know what?  That's incredibly liberating.  ..Spread your wings brother.  Let's let this bullshit be history.  Be hopeful.  
I don't have much to add but just wanted to say thank you for sharing I relate to this story a lot and I bet a lot of us do.  I honestly didn't think I was going to properly quit a month ago (too many attempts and failures couldn't get past a couple days sober) but for some reason it clicked and I'm doing better than I have in a long time.  You got this whenever you are ready to and here's at least one internet stranger rooting for you. :)
I understand that you've hated the concept of putting sobriety first...but it doesn't have to be continual white knuckling nail biting resistance -- in fact if it were I think hardly anyone would ever succeed in quitting for good. I had to learn to treasure myself treat myself well love myself...Gawd it's so cheesy but it's true for me. It's where I had to start and build outward from there. Far from being some kind of continual pitched battle I have peace and contentment to a degree I never really thought possible before. Removing the drama of alcohol from my life has restored me to sanity. I truly wish the best for you and it sounds like you've had an epiphany. Keep coming back here and keep us posted!
I'm 44 right now. I felt exactly the way you describe when I was 37. In August of that year I went to an in patient rehab and as a result of that and following the program of AA to the best of my ability I'm still sober today. ..Today I view the way I felt at the end of my drinking as a gift. Without that desperation without truly having nowhere else to go and nothing left to try the only two paths in my life were to try recovery or to die. Honestly if there had been any other choice I probably would have taken it. I didn't want to "put sobriety first" either. I didn't want to be an alcoholic...But it turns out I can now see that my mind wasn't functioning very well. In the grips of my addiction I was no longer the right person to decide what was best for me...Today I'm sober and surrounded by a host of friends. I have an amazing family (recently remarried) and a challenging job. I do put my sobriety first and it is an amazing uplifting thrilling way to live. I have never felt better in my life and I owe it to other sober alcoholics who showed me that I didn't need to keep living the way I was living...Thank you for sharing your story and please keep checking in. 
Hey brother. I know where you're coming from. I sobered up at age 51 after a LONG. history of similar antics. ..This can be done. It's the hardest thing you can imagine to do but it can be done. And once it happens it becomes really difficult to imagine a life that includes alcohol. ..Keep trying. Don't quit don't give up on yourself. But it takes work. ..Work is something you don't want to do because you want the results. That means attending meetings even when you'd rather watch the game. It means calling people even when you'd rather not pick up the phone...And above all it means getting completely and unreservedly HONEST. And that takes the most work of all. ..My problem was that I was an expert liar and I was my own best audience. Now when I look at a bottle of booze I know what will happen if I touch it. I can't lie and say it will be different this time. It won't. It'll be the same shit show it always was. I can't lie and say it's okay because it isn't. I can't lie and say I want the buzz more than all the good things in my life  because I don't. ..If you want sobriety you're going to have to work really hard because it sounds like your disease has taken a firm grip on you. But you can do it. It had me by the cahoolies and I managed to do it  and if a complete fuckup like me can manage it so can you.

This post and all of the ones that followed really touched me. What an amazing supportive group of individuals. 
Hang in there...You can do it.
Dont be sorry. Be SOBER. It's not what we think it is like at all. I don't feel imprisoned by being an alcoholic I feel free. I will never underestimate the power of this disease again. It is so much stronger than I imagined. It's scary strong really. But I am alive and only I can give my disease life and power over me by drinking again. I have that life! It's mine and I'm keeping it. Fuck you alcohol!
Brother..I don't often post on this subreddit but I feel compelled to respond to your post because it resonated with me on so many levels and we have some similarities...I am 36 years old; although I am not a professional just months ago I was in a graduate program (as a non-traditional student) and at the top of my class (literally); I had fought drinking for 14 years; and towards "the end" during my last few benders my behavior became *exponentially* more outlandish horrifying and atrocious. So we have some commonalities. Oh and you're not the only one who ruined a once-a-year family function that was supposed to be special...I can only say that you 100% **do not** have to drink again if you don't want to. I began periodically blacking out as far back as 2005 and by 2009 or so I was drinking every day morning to night. That lasted until August of 2015 at which point I realized that I had to stop drinking...Over the next fifteen months I tried with every ounce of my being to stop drinking on my own: I couldn't. I was seeing a therapist; I was fasting; I went to a handful of AA meetings; and I was on Campral. At most I would reach four or five weeks of sobriety before tearing my life apart on a truly lycanthropic bender. Finally my last bender caused some administrative problems and led to my forced "withdrawal" from graduate school. (If for any reason you are curious as to my state of mind at the time you can read about it in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/54l106/firsttime_poster_just_an_intro/))...In God's providence shortly after I made that post a professional association helped me to get into an inpatient treatment center: I quit a few days before going down and I stayed for eight weeks...I've been out of rehab for nine days and I am currently living out my 70th sober day...I can only tell you that enjoying life and being happy without alcohol is 100% possible. It's 100% doable...And ya' know what? You literally *couldn't pay me* to drink right now: it would only decrease the happiness and joy that I feel just from being alive in God's world and under God's care...All of us who have tasted the depths of alcoholism know the helplessness; the self-hatred; the despair; and that black black darkness. I spent years resenting the fact that I ever came out of the womb with the ability to say the word "I": with all of my heart I resented God for allowing me to enter this world...However all of that is gone now. I know that I'll have bad days but over the past couple of weeks something like not to use a buzzword *serenity* has begun to flower within me. I actually *enjoy* being a person in this world. As *tr s clich * as this sounds simple things give me actual *pleasure* each day that alcohol could never hope to rival: e.g. the sound of leaves crunching under my shoes; the sound of the wind in the trees; sunsets; watching my dogs lay in the floor and breathe; the tastes of even simple foods; sleeping...I'm rambling. I just know that you don't have to drink again...Have you considered going to an inpatient treatment program? I went through the Professional Program at [the Farley Center at Williamsburg Place] (http://www.farleycenter.com): it saved my life brother...Reading back over this post it wasn't nearly as helpful as I had hoped it would be. I feel like I left out 90% of what I had intended to say and garbled the 10% that actually made it into the post...I do have a question though. When you say that you have "done . . . AA[]" what do you mean by that? It *seems* to be in conflict with your final full paragraph wherein you state that you hated the notion of putting your sobriety first. Have you read the Big Book? Did you try 90x90 (ninety meetings in ninety days)? Did you have a home group? A sponsor? Or did you just sporadically visit AA meetings a few times after various benders? Prior to treatment I had only done the sporadic post-bender visitations and I thought that I had "tried" AA...Truth is I had never tried it. It sounds like you are experiencing new depths of awareness as to how truly *powerless* you are over alcohol: *and that's a good place to be!* Only recognition of our powerlessness can cause us to cling to the AA program with the desperation of drowning and dying men and it's that "clinging to" and wholehearted working that yields results...Brother I have been through so many changes in the past couple months that I can't say for sure what has "worked" for me. I just know that without the Lord Jesus Christ and without the practicality of daily AA meetings daily fellowship with those who share in a common suffering I would still be drinking myself into a suicidal oblivion...You don't have to live this way. There is an Escape. There is an Out. And despite what your disease is telling you **it is fully possible to be happy without alcohol! Truthfully I have tasted more true *happiness* in the last couple of weeks than I had experienced in the last eleven years!**..I wish you the best brother.
Are you at a place in your life where you could do a 90 day live-in rehab? They can be rather cheap in some places particularly if you have insurance. If I were you that might be the best way for it to stick long term. You'll have the confidence and tools to do it for another 90 days and I think things will look very different after a full 6 months. ..I know it's hard but when you're this fragile but I told all my friends I was getting sober and I had to refuse any events where there was alcohol. If my friends didn't respect that they weren't my friends anymore. I lost a bunch of friends but in retrospect they were horrible influences and I've replaced them with friends who are great influences support and less emotionally draining in many ways. I firmly believe that you are who you associate with and it's exponentially harder to maintain sobriety around people who drink. I will not drink with you today!

Towards the end I did things I would have never imagined myself doing.  I threw up blood told myself I was going to die if I didn't stop but I still drank.  But that feeling of horror eventually got me to a place where I really wanted to stop and I was willing to do what it took to stop.  
Having a badge and doing daily pledges really helped me.
I've been where you've been and I'm now sober over 4 years. I too lost hope. Strangely it's a good place to be - because at that point of total fear overwhelm powerlessness - I realised that I'm totally fucked and definitely cannot control alcohol.  At all. In any way. On any level. It opened the door for me to get help. Clearly what I was doing was not working. AA has definitely worked for me but only after a few years of frigging around - I just had to reach that place of desperation first. You're on your way
