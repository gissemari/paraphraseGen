I have never experienced this but alcohol withdrawal can be very dangerous! I would try giving your doctor a call and see what they say! ..Is it itchy? Sometimes people feel very itchy when they withdraw. Your body kinda goes into shock from lack of alcohol. But call your doctor. 
another SoCal person here and yea that heatwave sucked. not sure about the rash but welcome back and keep fighting it WILL eventually stick. I will not drink with you tonight.
Hey there! Welcome aboard again. Rash means itching? Personally I never experienced something like this. I believe you know this but it's unlikely that you will get any good advice about your issue here because like you stated it is not a medical sub! ..Mostly people will tell you to seek the advice of a professional which is a good idea if you feel concerned. ..Stay strong! 
I know exactly what this is! YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO ALCOHOL! Just kidding I'm not a doctor but would it help you to stay sober if you told yourself it was an allergic reaction and to stay away from it?!?!.;-)
If you're concerned about the rash you should talk to a doctor. We cannot guess as to what that is.
