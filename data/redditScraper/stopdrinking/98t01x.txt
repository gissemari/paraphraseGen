Today is day one. I'm sitting in my car before work feeling like crap. I didn't write last night or read or draw. I want my life back. I know it will be a struggle but I can't keep going like this. I can't let myself get too far down this road. I'm already farther thanI ever thought I would be. So for just today IWNDWY.

I did the same thing. I went like 60 days but never posted other than to congratulate other people in the comments. This time around I started a completely new username and I have decided to post whenever needed.
