Longest I've been sober in a few months..Had close to 3 years in February and took things for granted relapsed and have been on and off since then..I'm staying with my parents for a few nights and I start school again on Tuesday (I had to defer this semester due to alcohol use/depression/anxiety).This morning I woke up went for a swim hot tub took my parents dog for a walk..I still feel light headed at times and very anxious..I know this will pass as I've had long term sobriety before but I was hoping it would be gone by now..Kindling effect is real and scary the more I stopped and started and stopped the worse the withdrawal is..I can't stop eating which is fine I was underweight-ish at 6 0 145lb male have struggled with disordered eating in the past so I gotta watch myself but I'm basically giving myself free reign to eat what I want up until the 2 week mark (Sunday).I'm grateful my parents invited me to stay with them my dad even said he revisited some of his al-anon workbook after my relapse.Anyways sorry for the ramble.Feeling grateful today   ..IWNDWYT
