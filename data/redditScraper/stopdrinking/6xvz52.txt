I made it 135 days and I'm back at day one. I had this strange idea that I would get back into it and it would be fun again. It was not. I ended up sneaking booze into the house like a teenager to hide it from my wife. What I will do different this time is go to meetings and continue to mediate more. I would see posts on here about people relapsing and always told myself that that wouldnt be me. Well it was. Now I''m geting back up and dusting myself off. Thank you all for this awesome community. I won"t drink with you today.

Hey glad you're back. Day one should be easier now that you have 135 days of experience. 
Glad you're back!
Glad you're here; not drinking with you.
