My drinking slowly started becoming a problem about 3-4 years ago.  Over the months and years the thoughts that it might be a real problem persisted.  A number of personal struggles influenced me to continue to drink more and more even though I knew I was in danger of it having complete control of me.  ..I've tried to quit altogether 3-4 times in the past 6 months sometimes making it a few weeks others over a month.  Now I know I can't do it alone.  I need counseling and support from others going through the same thing.  I should have done this a year ago maybe two but better late than never.  I know that drinking has nearly killed my motivation spirit hope drive and abilities in the past and I'm tired of letting it own me.  Didn't drink last night even though it meant not falling asleep until after 5:00am.  First AA meeting is in about an hour!

Welcome aboard!..My first step was to talk to my doctor honestly about my drinking and intention to stop... I was prescribed medication to make detoxing safer and easier... There are also medications which can be used to treat alcohol dependence so you could explore the various options with your doctor.....I found the book '*Alcohol Explained*' and the book/YouTube '*This Naked Mind*' really helpful for understanding my drinking problem and permanently changing the way I view alcohol - they are well worth a look.....Regular contact with other problem drinkers in recovery can make a huge difference - you can do that via r/stopdrinking and/or AA SMART or one of the various recovery programmes.....It boils down to not putting the first drink into the hole in your face one day at a time and working on dealing with any underlying issues and current challenges with help from other people.....Best of luck and keep us posted!..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
