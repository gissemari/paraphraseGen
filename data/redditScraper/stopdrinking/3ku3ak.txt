Thank you...Thank you so much...As a community you have helped me over some of the hardest parts of all of this. Knowing what you have shared with us has helped me overcome the feelings of distance and loneliness that were a huge part of my rewiring...Having access to stories and struggles like my own 24 hours a day was a huge sense of relief for me (seriously feeling like no one understands is really hard to overcome without constant reinforcement.)...I've weathered a lot of storms in three years and know there are more to come but I have my sea legs now and it appears as though I can move forward with clarity and peace of mind...Thank you all so much.

Thank you for being part of our community.
What is the most important thing you learned in three years? ..What had been your biggest issue in your first year sober?..What had been your biggest issue in the second year sober?..What advice of someone's did you take about recovery and you decided that was bad advice after?..What advice of someone's did you *not* take about recovery that you decided later was actually good advice?..Thanks!
Amazing achievement well done!
