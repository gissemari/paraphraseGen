I'm in a funk & starting to realize a lot of the reasons I drank so much. For one I'm boring. I way too reserved I'm afraid to lighten up & I feel an incessant need to display an image of professionalism. I'm too big picture. I need to shed more light on little things & become more engaged with those around me. Drinking narrowed my mind. It took away the need I felt to remain professional it allowed me to focus in on stupid silly things I'd lighten up & act loosely with people I cared less about how I appeared & how people would judge me. I'd even open up to strangers which helped minimize my reservedness. What I need are ways to achieve this without alcohol. It's sometimes hard to talk about these things without appearing to be a pretentious asshole. Especially this next subject. I feel like I'm a good deal more intelligent than most people around me (See? I'm a huge asshole!). I hate small talk. I sometimes feel like I'm being brought down by casual conversations like I need something more substantial (Continuing to sound like an enormous asshole... and now to tie it all together!). Drinking "dumbed" me down which sounds like a HUGE negative. Why would someone want to be less intelligent? It made me feel like I could relate to people on an equal (reduced) intelligence level. This is my biggest struggle. I need to find something I'm passionately educated about & put it to use on a project or within a group of peers. This way I have a place where I can feel like an intellect & and casual remedial conversations won't feel like something that entirely defines me because it won't be my only form of communication with the people around me. Although it might sound like I'm looking down on people that's not my intention. This is just an honest portrayal of some of my triggers. An unrestrained blunt confession...Blahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...

Well I don't know you from a groundhog however it sounds like you judge everyone and yourself quite critically.  Humans engage in conversations often to gain approval and social acceptance from peers; the subject matter itself is largely irrelevant.  Of primary importance is the act of communing and feeling a part of a larger group.  When you judge others and yourself you separate yourself from your community and that is a lonely place to be.  Having said that I wish you luck and forbearance with yourself and those with which you associate.
