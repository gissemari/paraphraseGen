Hey. I will try to keep this brief...&amp;#x200B;..Me: Long time alcoholic 5 year baclofen user. Almost never get cravings any more but boy I used to you know the ones...an all consuming need for one drink then the next one and so on till oblivion...Right now I work from home to launch my own online business and am having difficulty ending 'work'. I stop the tasks for the day and then struggle to stop 'work mode' until there is a drink open. Ive put more sober time together since I found this subreddit than in 2 years before but I still go a few days then have half a bottle to a bottle of wine...then rinse and repeat...&amp;#x200B;..Heres the thing Ive been noticing. Its not a craving for the wine. It can be a craving to 'stop' the anxious maelstorm of work thoughts and slight stress.... but its also about not having a drink open...  .As I type this I have a glass of wine on my desk. I poured it 20 mins ago then started answering emails and then realised I didnt 'need' to drink it but my need for it reduced once it was there next to me...I have no idea what this means... does anyone have any relevent experiences with triggers like this?..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;

I would have a similar feeling overcome me as soon as I could pour that first drink. But I realized sometimes I would pour it but then get distracted by something (kids phone calls etc.) and wouldn't actually start drinking it for another hour or so. But yet the relief or reassurance as you said had already set in as I knew my drink was there waiting for me. ..Based on a few things I've read lately it was my 'desire' to drink that drove me to maintain my drinking habit and not the drink itself.  The book Biology of Desire is based on this. I just started reading it though so I don't have any more insights to share.  But I know the fear you describe well. Who wants to give up their nice warm fluffy blanket right? Thankfully I've had a mental shift happen and made it one month. I don't know if anything I said helps just wanted to say 'I get it'.
Thank you for this. I will look into getting a copy of that book. 
Some of the best relief is after purchasing alcohol but before you drink it. Like such a rush sitting in the parking lot even though I wouldn't drink any until I got home. Just knowing I had re-upped my stash did wonders. Sad really.
