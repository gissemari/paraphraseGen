Hi guys I really dont know where to begin. I was 7 years sober from alcohol and relapsed some time ago. Now I can't even go 2 weeks sober and it's really creating problems between me and my family even with some relationships. I can really use someone's help right now someone to check in on my sober status since I now vowed to never drink again. It's not for me and I'm serious about this. I want to be healthy again and I want to live better again. Thanks and feel free to messege me I hope you guys can understand.

I absolutely need multiple people places and things to support me in sobriety. This sub helps but I need most of my support in 3D.
Glad to check in with you...As u/pretendingtobenormal shares I get great support in real life from my sober network and free recovery meetings helped me build that network!
I'm  glad you are here. You are not alone. I was sober for 10 yearsthen slipped back in for 10. My drinking was also driving a wedge between me and my family. It definatly was a progressive thing. SD is my only support group besides my family..I am fine without face to face meetings but many find them crucial for their sobriety. The book This Naked Mind really helped me.  Journaling and my family and that's about it. Those 4 things have helped me get to the point of realizing my life is far better without alcohol. I don't  want it as part of my life anymore. I will not drink with you today.
