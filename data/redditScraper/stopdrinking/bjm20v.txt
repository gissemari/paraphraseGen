This time last week I posted in /sd after coming off a three week (at least) binge. I'd like to report that I've now been sober for 8 days and feel of course great. I visit this group every day and the sense of community is wonderful. Thank you all...The first three days were tough. I'd never made it past 3 days sober in the last three years. The fourth day felt like a triumph and maybe it was something surrounding that day mentally but after that it's been more or less smooth sailing. A week ago being sober for seven days straight sounded impossible. Now one more week sober sounds doable. I imagine after this next week one month sober won't even sound like that big of a deal (whereas prior this would have sounded like a death sentence)...I'm lucky that I haven't experienced too harsh of withdrawal symptoms though I do have headaches each night - maybe withdrawal? I also experience a lot of anxiety as night time approaches. This happens for me and is one of the primary reasons I'd drink - night time means the next day is approaching (and whatever duties that all includes) I'll soon have to struggle to sleep (insomniac) I'm running out of time to complete whatever is on my list for that day and on top of that - this is my time to relax! I'd find myself drinking 1/2 a liter of vodka a night and watching Netflix into the wee hours of the morning before turning around and going to work at 9am. ..I've been combatting this anxiety by following much of the same routine as before sans alcohol. I can feel the anxieties start to subside and have hope that eventually they'll slip away. Each day sober I'm able to tackle more and more and thus I don't feel a panic as night comes but am able to actual enjoy it. I'm not totally there yet - but I look forward to the day when it actually feels natural to lay in bed with a book. ..As I've seen others remark the sheer amount of time you have available to you when you're not drinking is mind boggling and sometimes anxiety inducing in itself. It's not so much that I have more time but that I have more self-aware time. I'm not spending 6 hours a day drunk! This past weekend was definitely a challenge with the looming question of "What to do?". I wouldn't say I "passed" this weekend - I was so bored! But after spending hours alone in my room it showed me how much time I have and what can be accomplished in an hour. I can slow down and enjoy simple things. I can indulge if I want to. I can spend an hour laying in bed on my phone and it's still less time wasted than if I was on a drinking binge which lasts no less than three hours if not several days. So who cares if I sleep in a bit? These little things no longer cause me to panic because I can now clearly deduce and divide the time I have in a day between leisure and productiveness. ..One more thing I'd like to mention/vent about is avoiding drinking in social settings. This past week I was worried because I had three opportunities to drink with my office. We hosted two events and also went out for drinks another time. I was worried the temptation would be too much but to my surprise I not only didn't drink but simply didn't want to. Beforehand I saw these as opportunities to get a nice buzz before departing and seeking out more alcohol. This meant my day would be over by 5pm and it'd be a steady descent into drunkenness from there. ..I do get annoyed by justifying my option to not drink though especially when the expectation to drink is pretty high in my office. Now that I'm not drinking I find it pretty baffling and inappropriate that anyone in a workplace should be looked at quizzically for not having a cocktail. Most people here are 25-30 in age and damn. Nothing like having to repeat "Oh I'm not drinking" over...and over...and over again. I've opted for the mocktails seltzer with a lime whatever! But yet the expectation is to hang around for a few hours - and eventually people catch on that you're the only one not with a beer. Alas - I don't care if it makes them uncomfortable! I'll take pride in my mocktail lol. ;)..Happy hump day everyone and I look forward to my second week of sobriety!! IWNDWYT.

Well done. I am also happily amazed at how much more time you have sober.
