YOU CAN DO IT! I BELIEVE IN YOU!..Having trouble with drinking doesn't make you a bad person! It means your a human being who has had an adverse chemical reaction to a legal substance! Don't be embarrassed about getting help! Your not alone so many people struggle with this even if you can't see it in your daily life! You can come here for guidance if your embarrassed about it in person! There is no right or wrong way to get sober only whats right for you! Feel it out! ..Just wanted to share some positivity because I'm having a good day and feeling strong! I don't crave it anymore and at parties I don't feel pressure! I've lost 20lbs and I've been open with my friends about why I quit! I feel so freed and I want to share that love with all of you today!..I will not drink with you today!
