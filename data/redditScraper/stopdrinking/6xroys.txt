*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*..***. .**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!. .What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up...***. .**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.. .**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.. .---..**Good morning! Long time no see right? Since there weren't any volunteers to host the DCI this week the mods have given me the go-ahead to host for the next seven days as well.**..**I'm pleased to be hosting again and would like to let everyone know that should you be interested you're welcome to give the mods a shout out. Then we'll go ahead and get you on the schedule for the next week.**..***..I hope everyone had a great start to their weekend yesterday. I know I was able to knock out some work around the house that I've been putting off for a while and it definitely felt good. Playing some golf with a friend this afternoon and definitely looking forward to getting out in the sun and having a good time. Luckily golf was never an activity I traditionally drank during so I'm not too worried about feeling any temptations...Regardless of what you are doing it's always a good day to make changes and make good decisions. Whenever I read a post about someone who has slipped and and had a few drinks (or even gotten very drunk) I get a little upset with how much they seem to beat themselves up over it. And while I was certainly that person for a long time it doesn't mean that sober time prior to the 'relapse' (if you want to call it that) is lost. Instead I sincerely believe that each stint of 4 days here 6 days there etc. was a learning experience that taught me lessons which have allowed me to get to where I am today...Long story short my message for the day is to be kind to yourself. No matter what your circumstances are I don't think it can ever harm to be kind to yourself. There's just no point in beating ourselves up over the past. The past is long gone and we can't change it. All we can do is reflect upon our experiences identify things we would've done differently and use that knowledge to avoid repeating our mistakes...Have a great Sunday all and I look forward to hosting again this week. I'll do my best to come up with some good stuff for you to keep things fresh and (as best I can) provide some new viewpoints and thoughts about sobriety. Happy to say that I won't be drinking with you today!

Good morning. Not drinking today.  Nope.
Hey SD! I'm not drinking today. It's pouring rain my SO just left for work and I'm having a cup of coffee in bed on a lazy Sunday morning. Sobriety *rocks*! Have a great day!..Thanks again for your continued service dear u/xJToews19! Have a great time swingin' the sticks today :). I used to be an avid golfer (lived on a golf course in gated community) but I haven't hit any balls since I got sober (drank all. the. time. golfing) but I'm sure I'd have a lot less balls in the drink (*huh pun!*) or on the beach when on the course lol! Enjoy yourself babe you deserve it ;). xo
I won't drink today.
I will not drink today!
Hi SD staying sober with you today. Cruising through this holiday weekend. Getting things done in the garden getting ready for autumn. 
I will not drink today.
Hello SD..Thank you for being there for me yesterday. As always you have shown me nothing but support and well intended advises...I will not drink today.
Good morning all. It's a chilly Sunday morning where I am in the UK. It's nice to get another fresh weekend under my belt. The wife was out partying last night she drinks on a weekend but only out of the house so that makes it easier. Still not tempted. Rock on guys looking forward to a fresh Monday!
I will not drink with you today.
Just relapsed again nothing really bad happened just really ashamed of myself over the past three days. Hurt someone again and feeling sick of myself..Tomorrow I'll call the GP to get more therapy since I'm drinking to surpress emotions I don't know how to deal with..Not drinking with you today!
I'm hanging in - no booze today :)
Not drinking with you all today!
I will not drink today!
I'll not drink today. Have a fantastic Sunday troops.
Thank you for hosting again /u/xJTowes19 I am very grateful :)..I really like what you say about 'relapsing' - I have a saying for myself that I have used on previous relapses - "Each time I try I get that bit closer to being the person I want to be &amp; to the life I want to live" :)..I didn't drink this morning or this afternoon &amp; I won't be drinking tonight :) And I still feel proud writing those words!
I will not drink today. 
I will not drink today 
Not drinking today &lt;3
What a profound message- thank you for that. We do beat ourselves up and that achieves nothing. Rather- looking forward and learning from the good and bad is what makes us stronger in the end. Here's to another great sober day! ..I will proudly not drink with you all today!!
Thank you for your message. You are right little victories can help make us stronger as we walk the road. I choose not to drink today. I will not drink with you today.
I will not drink today SD...Have a lovely Sunday!
Day two! Had real real trouble sleeping last night and what I did get was filled with intense and stressful dreams. I'm so exhausted...I really just want to stay curled up in bed all day but I am trying to not cancel anymore plans. I have done enough of that...I am not drinking with you today. 
I will not drink today!
Good morning everyone! I swear in these early stages I'm always feeling my resolve slipping at night time. Not so much that I'm about to actually drink but it's once evening hits that I begin to doubt that I can do this for good. But when I'm awake at 6:30 on a Sunday feeling great and well rested I'm gratefully reminded of why I'm doing this..I will not drink with any of you today! (Or tonight)
Thanks for hosting again u/xJToews19! ..I'm not drinking today!
Hey hey hey! Thanks for hosting again this week you rock! I will not drink today.
I will not be drinking with you on any  golf course today. Welcome back and thanks for hosting again.  Good point about be too tough on ourselves. Hard not to..but serves no purpose. God knows  the rest of our world is rough enough on us . Stay focused. Swing easy. No three putts. 
Great message "be kind to yourself" - still learning that one thank you!.Very happy not to be drinking with you today :-)
I won't drink with y'all today! We're getting an early taste of fall where I am and it's going to be a beautiful day. I'm so happy that I don't have a hangover so that I can enjoy it!

Week three down quite amazing. Big thanks to all the SD crew for helping me plough on through.
No way am I drinking today. Time for a bagel coffee and a B complex vitamin. Treating my body right is a great feeling.
I won't  drink today - victory is mine! And yours!

I will not drink today!
Sober Sunday- now that I got my first experience with what that was like last week I wouldn't have it any other way. ..I will not drink with you today. 
I will not drink today. 
I'm divorced and my son spent the night first time being sober. We watched 3 movies and played video games all night. And I don't have to hide bottles this morning. This feels way better than drinking does. I will not drink with you today.
won't drink today!
Good morning SD! I will not drink today.
It's pouring here. I'm kind of wishing I had the Sunday Times to read but I'm too lazy to go out and find a copy so I'll just read here and enjoy my coffee. Still trying to kill the plague but it's a persistent bugger. 
After hurricane Harvey sunshine days are back same as after those terrible alcoholism days. From Houston Tx I'm ready to move forward  as an former active alcoholic I feel stronger than regular people  to do so. Of course I won't drink with you today. We're on!     
Great to wake up sober on a holiday weekend in Canada. I had hoped to get some chores done this weekend but am struggling with motivation. I agree 100% with being kind to ourselves as we heal from decades of alcohol abuse I'd love any recommendations on good reading resources - most that I've found are on becoming sober not the long term psychological relearning which is needed. IWNDWYT 
Thanks for hosting and the insightful comments concerning being kind to yourself and not dwelling on the past.  Great advice!!  We are all human and make mistakes...every new day is a blessing and a chance ...I will not drink with you today!!!
Not today people!
It's my son's birthday today definitely not drinking today   
31 days today. One month+. I have been lucky in that it hasn't really been all that hard for me. I have had moments but my perspective has thoroughly changed. I took my girl out for a celebratory dinner last night and really enjoyed staying clean and lucid throughout...From here forward every day is the longest I've been sober in over 20 years.
Had a dream about drinking. I have never dreamed about drinking before. I woke up thirsty. I will not give in. I will not be drinking with you today! 
Going to work! I will not drink with you today!
 I'm going to my first social event where there will be alcohol since I stopped drinking. I will be strong because I want to be sober. I like being sober. I will not drink today!
I will not drink today.
I often got a stubborn defiant attitude the day after a "relapse". Voice in my head said "yeah that's right I fucking drank last night. It happened. Leave me alone".   I guess I didn't want to beat myself up but put up a wall so I wouldn't face it either. But I agree wholeheartedly that whatever period of sobriety you built up matters and is forward progress. Even if you are sober for a week and then drink for three months. You will remember that week and know you can do it. Once I was sober for three weeks. I then proceeded to drink every day for six years. But I never forgot that three weeks...Last year I set my record at 120 days then did not make thirty again for over a year. I asked myself just now how much better off I'd be if I had just kept that 120 days going. The truth is as much progress as I'd made I just wasn't ready to quit for good. I knew that I would drink again. And I did. This time I set a new record every day and I feel my mindset has completely changed. I don't feel that I will drink again. Not going to be cocky and say it can't happen. I have a healthy respect and fear of the power of that addiction. . I will not drink today. 
I will not drink today.
Happy to wake up without a hangover. I won't drink today.
IWNDWYT.
Checking in at 3 weeks! I will not drink today.
Hi everyone good morning. I'm not drinking today.
Yes good reminder to be kind to ourselves. I won't drink with you today as an act of kindness to myself. 
Good morning! I will not drink today. 
Just joined this today. I'm happy to be 244 days sober. I am not going to drink today. Happy to wake up clear headed make today's sermon and to the gym things I couldn't do on Sundays for years. 
I will not drink with you today. 
I'm not drinking today. 
I will not drink today!
Hello SD! It's raining out. I am bruised and scraped up and sore from my last night with alcohol. I slept 12 hours last night and I'm feeling more positive about moving forward and less self-loathing. I'm not going to drink today. What I AM going to do is have a nice walk in the rain look after my friends' cats tidy up my apartment and maybe finish reading The Girl on the Train. And have a shower.  Oh boy do I need a shower. 
Let's give it a shot. I will not drink today!
Today marks 14 days the longest I've gone on my own accord.
I will not drink today!!
Starting the day with a large DD black coffee...I will not drink with you today.
Feeling great this morning! still have a tiny bit of sickness going on but it's almost over. Already went out and hauled two truck loads of woodchip for my garden worked on some art fundamentals drank some earl grey and got some house work done. Looking forward to dog walking painting fiddle playing reading play time with my little girl and lots and lots of tea drinking. Good I am so grateful for finding free wood chips for my garden in my area and for not putting ethanol in my mouth for 66 days so that I'm not hungover and I have the energy to go out and collect them.  I will choose to not poison my body nor my mind today I will eat healthy vegan foods today I will not put ethanol in my mouth today!
I will not drink poison today. 
Not drinking today!
I won't drink today. 
I am not drinking with you tonight!
Ah my coffee is tasting so good right now in Ca. .Still getting used to waking up and not feeling horrible from the night before. First time in years. .I will not drink with you all today.

Feeling better every day and will not be drinking today!
Hey everyone  glad you all seem happy   I've had a good day too and am not drinking with you all today.  Went out for a nice lunch and having a snack for tea in a bit washed down with tesco fizzy flavoured water!

Closing in on 1 year and looking forward to a couple of days at my cabin in the woods to celebrate. Not drinking. No siree Bob.

I will not drink today. I'm feeling quite alright at the 2 week mark.
No drinking today or the next 24 hrs.
I will not drink today 
I'm not drinking today. I have a question though. This is day 6 for me. When does this burst of energy come in that I've been hearing about. I'm not motivated to do anything this weekend. Basically I get up eat smoke watch Netflix and peruse Reddit then back to bed. Repeat. 
I am having a horrible Sunday.  A psycho work client that won't leave me alone and I'm so stressed out about it even my younger dog can feel it and is reacting to it.  Let alone my wife who has left for the day to get away from me...Regardless alcohol is not on the menu.  I will not be drinking with you today.  I just doesn't help anything...Try to have a good day everyone.
I will not drink with you all today.  Try to have a great day everyone.
Will not drink today. 
I will not drink today.  
I will not drink today. 
I will not drink with you today. I am also proud that i have made it month month of September you're going down too!
Not drinking today!
Today is Day two. Long journey ahead. I want a drink but instead I am about to head out the door to the gym. We can do this. I will not drink today.
I cycled for 2 hours today and my plan has worked - I'm too knackered to get off the settee to go and buy any wine  :)  I will not drink with you all today!
Hey everyone been awhile since I've been here. Gotta say it's good to be back. Made an ass out of myself drinking on Friday and probably will have to deal with some fallout on Tuesday for it but no drinks today. Spending the weekend in the mountains with my beautiful fiancee and going fishing. Thanks for being here! 
I will not drink with you all today. It's been an up and down road but i'll get there come hell or high water.
I won't drink with you all today. Struggling with cravings but staying strong.
I will not drink today.
Not today. Not today. Not today!
This weekend has a flurry of activity - almost all of it fun - but I'm stopping by to say I won't drink with you all today! 
Today I am not going to drink. 
No matter what happens I will not drink today. 
Sundays are the hardest. I will not drink with y'all today. 
I'm not drinking today I've got a long run tomorrow that I plan on nailing and wine today won't make that any easier.
I will not drink today. 
I will not drink today
Not drinking today 
Just picked up "This Naked Mind".  On my second read of "Rational Recovery ". With that said. ..I will never drink again and I will never change my mind. ..have a great Sunday everyone !  
Starting over again. Not drinking today.
Thankful to be back. I will not drink that poison today. 
Late check in for me. I haven't drank today and I'm about to go to bed...See you all tomorrow. 
Yesterday we installed a slat wall in our garage and organized it and accomplished a lot. Today my hubby &amp; I got to go ocean kayaking with an old Groupon we had and I've never done it before. I LOVE OCEAN KAYAKING! I may have found a new hobby I truly enjoy. Today was perfection...I'm not drinking today. 
I'm celebrating the anniversary of the day I met my boyfriend today :)..I will not drink with you today 
Nearly bedtime in my timezone. End of second day. Been a weird one...Went for lunch and a long walk with a close friend. Told him I was stopping drinking. Told someone else too. They didn't realise how bad I'd gotten but they're being really supportive...My boyfriend cancelled plans because he was too hungover and it feels really strange to be on that side of things. It's usually me!..Had some periods of super fast heart beats this evening. That was really stressful. Drank some "immune booster" herbal tea and sat in a steamy bathroom until I felt better. And I did feel better...Now I'm going to put some ice tea to infuse in the fridge for the morning go outside to check the plants and the cats and have a cigarette. Then hopefully sleep...I did not drink with you today. Thank you. 
Good afternoon! Checking in to not drink with everyone today.
As I stand at a wedding  next to a table of mini wines I say: I will not drink today.
Not today!
I will not drink with you today. 
Not today
I will not drink today!!
Still here still not drinking today 
I will not drink today! 
I feel like I'm more hydrated than ever. Been going to bars with friends and drinking nothing but water. Every time I say I'm not drinking my friends congratulate me. This has been a great experience so far...Since I just hit double digits I guess I should keep this going. I'm not drinking with you all today.
I will not drink with you today
Day 14 here to all my brothers and sisters at SD. It's been ridiculous and I can feel my will power slipping away. I need to make 2 full weeks and for that I will not drink with you all today. 
Just finished my first sober weekend in a while   
My first difficult day. No work tomorrow and I'm all amped up and feeling great from BJJ.  Kind thoughts would be appreciated I will not drink today.
I will not drink today 
I will not drink with you today.
Not drinking with you lovely people today :D
Today is day one. I will not drink today. Thanks to everyone for being here I appreciate having things to read. 
34 days &amp; counting. Have not and will not be drinking with you today!
61 days of not drinking and I won't be drinking today either!
I know I'm a bit late I gotta bunch of stuff done hung out with a kid/adult that I used to work with. Had a wicked supper with my wife and folks..and I did it all sober. 
First day today. Drinking far too much and am determined to quit it! Have been drinking 3/4 days a week for a while and now almost every day. Time to stop me thinks.
I will not drink today!
This day one is coming to a close for me. Was my first day with a new sobriety date. I haven't drank since March but as of 9/3/17 I also quit weed so I'm clean and sober now. I used to go to AA and my closest family still does but I am keeping it low-key just focusing on health and peace and letting go of anxiety and fears. All of life is much better because I quit drinking lots of stupid poison. I like the sub thanks!
