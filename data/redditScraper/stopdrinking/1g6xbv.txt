good morning!  ..Triumph:  Day 4!  Woke up tired but not hungover so that's a win!.Struggle:  Back strain making it hard to stay busy around the house to keep my mind..General:  things waaaaaay better with my hubby...My Goal today is just NOT to drink straighten living room and have a nice dinner ready for hubby when he gets home.  Have a great day everyone!.
Thanks for posting this!  Glad things are going well for you... that's exciting about your upcoming move!..**Triumph**: I made it through my ~2 week cruise without drinking.  There was a ton of pressure from waitstaff and I constantly had alcohol shoved in my face (was even made to feel bad about it a few times).  But I handled it and came out the other side.  Also I gained 4.5 pounds during my vacation.  I started the vacation at 214.5 and weighed myself when I got home (4 days ago) and was 219.  This morning: 213 (my lowest yet!).  Since returning home I've ridden 65 miles on my bicycle (over 2 days) gone 12 miles on the elliptical at the gym (over two visits) attended a Krav Maga class and smacked tennis balls against a wall (with a tennis racket) for 20 minutes.  Glad I didn't fall out of my new lifestyle of exercising!..**Struggle**: The cruise was quite stressful.  A few frustrating things happened early on: my new sport coat which had to be adjusted was ready 5 minutes before my shuttle arrived to take me to the airport (24 hours later than promised); my Maryland Bridge (false tooth) came loose and out on our first night in Rome; our bed in Rome was so stiff I felt like someone came in and beat me with a baseball bat -- all night long.  And a few of the waitstaff on the cruise really tried to make me feel bad for not drinking.  Then there were a few occasions that I really did want to drink (which hasn't happened often in almost 7 months).  But I didn't.  I knew what it would lead to.  So I stuck with my pineapple juice (or water)...I've noticed that I'm reacting in a negative way (sighs or cursing under my breath) when frustrating things happen and the people around me are reacting to that.  "What wrong (now)?"  To me the feeling of frustration is fleeting but apparently my reaction has a lasting impact on the people near me.  I need to learn to minimize those reactions I have...**General chat**: We're set to batten down the hatches at home.  They're using that "durecho" word that was thrown around here (Washington DC) last summer again.  Hopefully the storms won't be as bad as they're saying it might be.
Triumph: hit 200 days without even realizing it! ..Struggle: none this week everything is pretty fucking awesome..General chat: I'm training for a tri and loving it!
Triumph: still kicking ass on the sobriety front...Struggle:  feeling at loose ends.  Plenty of things to do but no major goals.  I need to find one...General chat:  good god y'all summer has made it to the south. I'm fixing to drown in my own sweat.  Ugh.
Happy Wednesday everyone!..Triumph: just made it past 2 weeks. Never thought even 2 DAYS could happen...Struggle: going to Las Vegas this weekend - not extremely worried at the moment but know there will be numerous numerous numerous situations where I'll be surrounded by drinking.  Staying positive though!..General: Well unintentionally I haven't eaten meat in about a week and a half - I've been changing my eating habits quite a bit and am loving how I've been feeling lately.  I've been learning a TON about nutrition too.  It feels good to care about and pay attention to what you're putting in your body...Have a good one folks!
**Triumph** Almost 3 weeks without a drink. Have ridden my bike to work every day for this period slept well and haven't been tempted to drink...**Struggle** Learned I might be facing jail time for my DUI. Fixing my finances which I managed to screw up pretty badly. Legal bills etc. don't help the situation...**General Chat** Dating someone who also doesn't drink. Not sure if I'm ready for a relationship though.

Triumph: Finally got motivated to do some spring cleaning over the last couple of days. (living in a ~500sq Ft apartment means it doesn't take long) Almost finished!! Should finish it up today...Struggle: Still trying to find the balance between AA and SMART recovery.  Mostly due to SMART not being as convenient...General: The Calgary Stampede is fast approaching.  My boss has given me the 10 days off and I have found a job for those ten days at a very popular very upscale restaurant.  It will mean 10 days of ~16hrs a day but also a massive amount of money to go into the bank.  Maybe a new Omega or a Grand Seiko when it is all done!
Triumph: bought a new car found our wedding venue my powerlifting program is going well and I'm enjoying life!..Struggle: trying to trust that I have what I need. Not much room in our budget for clothes or fancy hair appointments. Reality check!..General chat: chicken is delicious
Triumph: Lots!  Told my friends and family that I'm done with drinking for good made it to the 3 week mark.  And last night I even spent some time in a church basement... taking a boxing class!  The first couple of weeks were spent mainly just figuring out how my life was going to be without alcohol (and that's still ongoing) but it's time to stop using "I just quit drinking" as an excuse to fuck around and not accomplish other things...Struggle: Ongoing struggle with sticking to my ketogenic diet.  I used to satiate my hunger with scotch but now I've been hitting the chocolate HARD.  Most people keep asking if I'm losing weight when I say that I've quit drinking and the answer is that I'm packing it on :(..General Chat: Going to my first sober wedding this weekend.  I might smoke a little pot later in the evening depending on what the crowd is like but it's going to be very interesting observing a wedding without alcohol.  I definitely have trouble sitting still for a long time so we'll see how that goes.  
Triumph: Sober and guilt free for 2 weeks yay!  (I actually look forward to Sunday mornings now how weird is that?)..Struggle: Work stress but I survived recent layoffs!..General chat: Please Sun come back so I can go outside and work my dogs?..Take care everybody!.
...I keep having dreams that I go to an AA meeting and pick up a desire chip and walk out the door to have people I know congratulate me...WTF
**Triumph**: Passed six weeks sober now. Haven't thought much about drinking lately even on the weekends...**Struggle**: Trouble in pretty much every relationship in my life. Common denominator is obviously me but I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong...**General**: Summertime (almost) and the living is getting much much easier.
Happy to hear you're enjoying sobriety!..Triumph: I decided to quit drinking yesterday.  No more breaks no more half assing.  I'm doing it...Struggle: I decided to quit drinking yesterday.  And it's summer. And all my friends love to drink.  And I have 3 festivals coming up in a row that are saturated with alcohol and I'm nervous about it.  ..General chat: My britta water bottle is my new best friend.  LOVE that thing!
Triumph: Didn't drink today or the other 15 days before. .Struggle: I work in an Emergency Room and one of my fellow nurses died yesterday riding her motorcycle. We see lots of wrecks at work many of them motorcycles. So frustrating that it was one of our own. She was a damn good nurse.   A truck hit her as she was pulling out of a parking lot. Very sad....General: I've been catching up on Arrested Development...perfect viewing pleasure for anyone who needs a good laugh. 
Triumph: Started lifting a little bit every day again. It's nice stress relief..Struggle: Been thinking about old times quite a bit and some alone time I'm going to have in the next few weeks..General: Looking forward to the cup starting tonight life is good when I am sober. I just need to remember to keep at it.
triumph: walked my daughter to school and hit the gym going to make a habit of that...struggle: feeling sad and alone and confused..general: getting to understand that drinking (even light beer) is not going to stop me feeling sad or lonely

Triumph: After successfully moving out of my alcoholic father's home and into my mother's apartment 3 weeks ago I FINALLY have a job. After being without a computer for a month I'm going to buy a new one for myself as a treat for staying sober...EDIT: HOW COULD I FORGET A BIG ONE?! I quit smoking!!! 12 days strong!! I can't believe I gave up alcohol AND smoking. Who am I becoming???..Struggle: After dealing with a wave of new emotions that come with early sobriety I'm feeling a sort of "identity crisis" these days. Struggling on what behaviour is acceptable in regards to how other people treat me. I've been used and walked all over my whole life and I'm finally starting to see with clarity that I do not deserve to be treated like crap. (I guess its not really a struggle but it's sort of a conflict.) ..General: I reallllly like my new coworkers. Everyone is so friendly to me and my job is great. I finally feel like a productive member of society. 
**Triumph:** Went out for "drinks" last night and was totally fine being the only one at the bar not drinking alcohol. I lied about the reason (told them it was for health reasons) but other then that I felt good about it...**Struggle:** Not sure if it's PAWS but I've been feeling "off" this week. I'm tired all the time having a difficult time concentrating and having a tough time getting motivated to do anything besides work/sleep...**General Chat:** Looking forward to a weekend of doing stuff instead of spending the whole thing drunk/hungover!!
