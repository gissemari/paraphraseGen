Third time's a charm right? For the third time this year I can carry my red 30 day chip with me in my pocket. I don't mean to make light of the multiple relapses I've gone through - that shit's serious business - but something this time genuinely feels different almost as if I don't even think of it as a real achievement just one more day of not drinking down. I mean that in the most positive way possible way of course...I know the opinions on SD regarding AA vary widely but for me the  way I feel today exists only by the grace of my Higher Power the strength of the Fellowship and the work I've done with my sponsor...I could be walking around with a 6 month chip in my pocket but today I'm more than overjoyed to have this little red piece of plastic on me...So for today I will not drink with you SD!

Congrats I too are beginning again. Only 29 days to go.
Sorry I too am. Sister Mary Rap My Knuckles turned over in her grave.
Congrats!  Good work.
I relate so much with this! I could have a 7 month chip. Or a 2 year chip. But I don't. Just this green 3 month. :) We get sober at the time we're supposed to I guess. ..Something's different this time for me too. This is the first time I've done AA and I do think it's working. ..I also think that those times before when I relapsed or tried moderation. I was still doing the work and it was still a process of recovery. I just found a lot of ways that didn't work. And I had to go through those relapses to see how serious my disease really is. ..I still look back fondly on February 22 2016 and although that's not my sobriety date anymore that was when I first felt the willingness to change. I didn't know how yet but I was starting to really want sobriety. ..It's a marathon and not a sprint. :)
