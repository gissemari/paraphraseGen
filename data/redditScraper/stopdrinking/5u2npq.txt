Hi all ..My first testimony here in reddit I am a 43 years old male father of 2 and married to a wonderful abstemian woman...I have been a heavy drinker since my teen years and nevertheless I managed to build a family and career...For many times I tried to quit drinking but for some or another reason always relapsed and got drinking more and more on a daily basis I could easily drink 12 33cl beers and some 3-4 whiskies or other spirit...Before this last Christmas I decided enough is enough and took a decision to offer me a once and for all solution to my drinking...I have seen a doctor while on vacation in Portugal (i live in Angola - Africa) and trough reddit I managed to download the book "This Naked Mind - Annie Grace" have read it and it opened me a new door to understand why I drinked and why I do not need to drink to have a full life...My doctor prescribed me a daily dose of Disulfiram administered by my wife...Have also engaged into a crossfit program...8 weeks after I am clean and not feeling the urge to drink happier as i have never been going out to parties and bars knowing that no matter what I cannot drink so I could see how sad and strange a drunk person is...Will keep on disulfiram for at least one year to avoid fall in another trap but for the time being I am in love with the sober me I am a wonderful father son brother colleague and a serial entrepreneur when am not drinking or drunk and will keep it like that!..I won't drink tomorrow...
