Hi guys  .This might seem like a bit of a daft one but it's something I'm having a hard time with and I wanted to see if anyone else was in the same boat.  ..While I was drinking it felt like the only things I was capable of feeling were anger shame or this weird empty state that I'm not sure how to describe.  .After being sober for 2 months I'm finding out that I'm not the angry robot I thought I was and that I am capable of having emotions.  ..My little sister has been having a hard time recently and has just been diagnosed with MS so I went home to my mum's for the evening to visit her. I get to my mum's and my little sister has made me cookies and is waiting to give some to me. This is a 15 year old girl who's too cool for anything and she shared her cookies wkth me and I wanted to cry. I dont remember the last time I've felt so appreciative of anything. It was really nice though I definitely felt like a pillock trying not to cry over cookies...This is great right but as nice as it is to be able to have all the good emotions I've found I'm not so great at dealing with the bad ones.  ..Work in particular is a big cause of this. I've been making some big strides since I've stopped drinking and started picking up some more responsibility. I pushed for it because I want it but now I'm starting to get it I'm struggling to keep things together. I'm regularly sneaking off to the toilet for a bit of a mini freakout/crying session and I don't know how to cope with it. Normally I'd have a beer and shove it all deep but that's not an option any more.  ..Any of you old pros got any tips for me?..Cheers

My tips towards surviving our burnout culture without touching alcohol..&amp;#x200B;..1. **Know your escape routes**. If you find yourself heading towards a stressful situation know how you can leave it if it becomes too overwhelming for you. Of course it's hard to just leave work whenever you get stressed but having a ride home/ knowing you are in charge of where you are is important during moments of panic. .2. **HEALTHY COPING MECHANISMS** are not unobtainable fantastical creatures touted by talk-show hosts and therapists they're real and accessible you just need to find what works for you. Music art exercise a fancy bottle of mineral water. It's important to treat yourself and its easy to find a non-alcoholic way to do that. You'll find you start looking forward to a break at work where you can eat the mousse that you packed for yourself or getting home so you can take your dog out on a walk and listen to that new podcast you're stoked on. Sometimes coping with stress looks a lot like distracting yourself from stress at first if you find your mind trailing from your work while you are exercising or eating a meal with your SO then thats a sign that the healthy coping mechanisms are working. .3. **Strive for honesty and self-awareness**. Above all else! This is sort of a subjective task but when I switched gears from drinking to not drinking I noticed I stopped deceiving people as frequently I had less to hide about myself. This honesty with others and myself ended up fostering better lines of communication in work and relationships. The extra energy I had from not being hungover all the time made me feel like I was a superhero of some sort. This is where the self-awareness comes into play. Know your limits reward your successes learn from your failures. Getting sober is a feat that will likely boost your understanding of your own willpower but you still are human. *Don't save a drowning person if you don't know how to swim yet*. Strengthen your skillsets take on challenging projects but learn the difference between goal-oriented obstacles and vocational blackholes...&amp;#x200B;..I could go on and on about this stuff but I digress.

Oh boy sounds like a lot. I don't have any tips for you but wanted to send you encouragement to hang in there. You are doing great! IWNDWYT
Time. Depending on how severely you were drinking it can take up to a year for your brain to repair itself and your hormones to return to equilibrium. Cut yourself some slack it's not just "you". Your body is literally changing.
