Friend of nearly a decade or so. We've drank together the whole time until my sobriety. ..I notice now that he might love drinking but not the same way as me. He drinks a good bit. Binges on special occasions general drinking activities or drinking dates...We still go out to eat often and he doesn't even get a beer every time. What the fuck. Not because of me but because he doesn't want one. How could he not want one? I always want one. Guess he's just normal. ..I even smell his craft beers just to flirt with the past. Certainly not relapse material as I'm quite confident at this point.

Right!  I can't really afford to flirt at this point. I have a couple friends who honestly love drinking but can stop after one.  Hell they can go months with out a drink have one at a dinner date and then not drink again.  I would be blacked out on the curb asking a passing delivery pizza guy to take me home.
I don't know how those people do it..
