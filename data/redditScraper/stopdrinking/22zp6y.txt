Hi.I just found my way to here..I'm trying to catch up with all the info out here..I'm struggling for over a year now with my newfound drunkenness..I've been a normal drinker for the last 10 years but in the recent year I've increased the amount too much and it seems I can't stop...I really appreciate it if you answer my following questions with your .experiences..This my second sober day. .How do I break the habit how can I resist the urges?.What to do when the booze thoughts came?..I'm trying to start my recovery on my own (please bare in mind that I live in a country where alcoholism is not a big issue there is not much good sponsorship programmes out there and I don't want to go to a meeting) Can I do it by myself?.I don't want to share it when it is still too early with my friends.How to continue to see my friends even though we've always see each other at pubs etc..?.Please send me your suggestions..Thanks

The reason days are counted and people often say 'one day at at time' is because one day is manageable. You're saying 'what if' 'what if'. What happens when I have a wedding? A weekend? A trip to the south of France?..Don't worry about that. Everyone's goal is simple: stay sober for today. Just worry about today - have a plan for staying sober today. ..I have thus far done it by myself although I have used and relied on this subreddit heavily. I also live in a country where meetings are minimal (although you will be surprised just how many meetings there are out there - have a look)...W.r.t. friends at this point I would say one on one works best. Don't meet in pubs - you organise when you want to meet. If you have to leave leave...
I have attended thousands of meetings over the last 10 years another saying I love and live by is "if you haven't been to a meeting you hate you haven't been to enough meetings"...Be glad you have recourses like this to be able to receive so much advise from people all ver the addiction spectrum. The fact that you reached out is awesome. The most debilitating thing about my addiction was never asking for help.
