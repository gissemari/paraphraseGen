I never thought of myself as a big drinker until I realised I drink big! I HAVE to stop or even cut down would be good. The panic attacks are beyond my control. I have quit the weed (unintentionally.. the panic attacks made me feel I was going to die over 5 years I have not touched it) I'm getting that with alcohol now but my brain and my body and my body and my brain are not on the same wavelength! I feel I'm going to die the next day in all situations but the night before my brain is saying... hey your fine look. Let's have another..

Yeah I hated the anxiety too. Best part of quitting has been how much less anxiety I have sober.
