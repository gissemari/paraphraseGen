I GOT MY 1 WEEK BADGE AND I AM SO ELATED. ..Thank you /r/stopdrinking. Without you this road would be even harder than it already is. ..This week has been very happy but I am expecting some intense feelings and struggles in the future. But you guys AA and the support of my family and friends will make it just a little bit softer...Thank you from the bottom of my heart. ..Here's an update (I think I'll do this each week):..-Sober for 7 days...-Told family friends and the internet..-Attended AA each day..-Felt genuinely HAPPY for the first time in a long long time..-Face has started to depuff and I've lost a little weight..-Was around alcohol for the first time and didn't want to drink it..AH!..Smiling as I write this. THANK YOU AND CONGRATS TO ANYONE WHO DESERVES IT...And to all those who are working in the beginning like me... WE CAN AND WILL DO IT.

Congrats on day 7. Thing do get better in time. Change is good. Mistakes or slip-ups may happen. If we fail at anything it should be seen as a tool to learn something from it and take the steps to improve. Keep steadfast in your convictions and you'll do fine. Your effort will pay off in the long run and keep a good attitude. Best wishes!
Isn't it great to get rid of the puff-n-stuff face? Congratulations!!
It's great to have a plan and tick a few steps off. It was a relief to me to just know that I was going to do certain things for myself. That little step turned out to lead to bigger steps. Keep on!
