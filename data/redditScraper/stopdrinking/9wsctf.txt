Been relapsing for a couple months now and I no longer see the point in living. I've completely destroyed any meaningful relationships I once had. Now they just ignore me even when I'm stone cold sober and asking for help. On top of it I'm bipolar as well. I've been in and out of rehabs IOPs and countless meetings. Nothing helps. I've lost the will to live. I guess I just want to put it out there. I'm at a total loss.

I've felt that way numerous times.  Have you tried therapy outside of the inpatient environment?  Can you speak to a doctor about medication options?  Please don't despair.  It can be so much better.  IWNDWYT.
I felt my emotions and hormones were all out of wack when drinking.  When I stopped drinking  my emotions became much more manageable after about 2 weeks.  Life didn't seem like so much of a grind all the time. ..&amp;#x200B;..I know the feeling of how hopeless it can seem but after taking a step back things make much more sense...Good luck...IWNDWYT...&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;
I've been there. I will not drink with you today
