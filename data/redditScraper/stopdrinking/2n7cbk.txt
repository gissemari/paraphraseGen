I love this subreddit and I believe it has been a huge part of my recovery so I would like to share some wisdom I gained in outpatient. The one idea that really helped me stay clean is what they called thought stopping techniques... Essentially a relapse doesn't start when you go and buy a bottle. It starts with a trigger followed by thoughts of drinking then inevitably the liquor store. You can't stop triggers they're everywhere. For me I always bought beer after work at the 711 by my house so driving by it always triggered thoughts of drinking. ..The idea behind thought stopping is recognizing your triggers and having a plan for dealing with and stopping the following thoughts of drinking. There are quite a few ways of doing it. One technique is called snapping wear a rubber band around your wrist and when you find yourself thinking about the sauce snap yourself hard to bring your thoughts back to reality and your commitment to stay sober...The technique that always worked for me is called envisioning. You play out the next few hours in your head and essentially talk yourself out of it. "Alright going out and drinking with my friends would be fun for a couple hours. Followed by drinking too much shame and guilt in the morning and inevitably losing all that I've accomplished. Do you really want to start at 0 days?"..There are a whole list of techniques that unfortunately I don't have on me but there are plenty of websites with different ways to keep you sober.

Interesting thanks for posting. I use envisioning without really knowing it I guess. I just think of all the bad shit that can happen if I were to drink and it usually stops any thoughts right there
I find making little plans for dealing with urges is really helpful. I differ in my experience of what you call triggers and them being everywhere out in the world. My experience is that life as I was leading could be said to be a "trigger" and so the idea is not meaningful to me. Instead I recognize that these urges come from my pattern of thinking and acting. Recognizing the thinking and preventing the acting--that's what you refer to as thought stopping and although I hadn't heard that term it seems right on as far as what it means. ..Envisioning is powerful once I've gotten to the stage of drinking being an intellectual decision. In the early days I didn't trust my brain so I relied more on actions that I didn't have to think about and that sidestepped the decision I had to make. So: Feel like drinking? Have a piece of chocolate right now. Drink a coke (I don't normally drink much soda). Take a walk. --all immediate acts that didn't force me to say no I'm not drinking--but helped me get there...Thanks for this post. 
I think you might benefit from taking a wider view of this whole thing.  You've hit upon some individual tricks that work for you (which is great and is exactly what you should be doing) but there are broader concepts behind each of these actions. ..&gt; You can't stop triggers they're everywhere. ..The next sentence should read [**"And it doesn't matter one bit because 'triggers' are and never were responsible for your drinking.  In fact they don't even actually exist.  You just think they do."**](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2l4n68/i_didnt_expect_to_have_any_white_knuckling_days/clrgko2)  ..When you talk about the rubber band trick you're really talking about two broader concepts. The first is [**using habit as tool to overcome your addiction**](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2gmktv/is_quitting_drinking_like_quitting_any_other_habit/)  The second is having a plan.  Plans allow you to [**avoid becoming overwhelmed**](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2mb629/on_day_4_alcohol_free_day_2_weed_free_feel/).  If you showed up to college and they threw every book and every assignment that you'd have to do in your entire 4 years there at you on your first day you'd cry.  That's why they don't do that.  They break it up into small tasks so you're not overwhelmed with anxiety. As long as you follow the plan you'll be OK.  The second reason plans are important is that they [**save you from having to make decisions when you're not thinking clearly.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2h0a3k/almost_one_week_tell_me_how_you_all_made_it/cko5nop)  That's what a plan is - a decision made in advance.  You do not think clearly when you're jonsin' for a drink.  A plan saves you from having to make decisions in that state...Different things work for different people.  I've heard of people using that rubber band trick before.  Not a lot but I've heard it.  That trick will likely not work for you forever.  One because it gets old and gets less effective but more importantly sobriety isn't a marathon it's a decathlon.  The game changes along the way.  Don't expect your kick ass swimming skills to get you through the biking leg.  (I'm pretty sure neither of those are part of an actual decathlon but you know what I mean. :)  The key is to not get complacent.  If I thought I "had this down" and had no more learnin' to do when I was early on I'd still be early on. I  had to change &amp; adapt.  That will happen to you too.  Based on what you've written here I think you're the type of guy who can easily figure it.  You've just gotta be willing.  Keep fightin' the good fight.  ..
yeah and think about the cycle that you dont have to continue.1) drinking gets out of control.2) quit drinking.3) try drinking again.4) repeat
My epiphany occurred as I was driving in to work a few months in to sobriety. I was starting a new day shift schedule and had to be there for 4:45 am. I am **so** not a day person (my mother said that even in kindergarten I looked like I needed a coffee and a cigarette in the morning when I got up for school)..Anyway driving in to work: there I was grumbling and whining to myself about how tired and crappy I felt. The next thought though  was "imagine how much worse this would feel if I was also hungover". ..That is now my go to line now when things go bad. Works like a charm.
[Gorski was written extensively on this subject.](http://www.tgorski.com/gorski_articles/understanding_relapse.htm)..It's pretty dry but worth reading at least once. I had to read it in treatment as well as outpatient. The bottom line is relapse actually occurs a *long* time before that drink hits your lips.
