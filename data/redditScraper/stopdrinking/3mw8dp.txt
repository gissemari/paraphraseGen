I started going to open AA meetings with my father when I was about 5 possibly younger until the day I moved out on my own. I was strictly straight edge until then. The AA community became my family since dad distanced us from all the drinkers in my blood family...I started pretty slow but eventually became a habitual drinker due to underlying emotional and psychological stresses. Mostly depression and anxiety. I drank 2-3 half gallons of vodka a week usually by myself surrounded by friends that never drank as often. .I've blacked out and made a damn fool of myself often and with a ferocity I've never personally witnessed from anyone else..Though I've come a long way in terms of how often I drink (once every week or two now...) I still struggle to stop once I've started. I will polish off a half gallon in under 48 hours if there's nobody around to stop me. My body has not reacted well to this. Stomach pains can last for days afterward...I am currently psyching myself up to turn myself in for probation violation following a DUI from last year. I don't know exactly what will happen as they stopped trying to contact me and I've been too petrified to contact them...I'm ready to quit and turn my life back around. It will be very tough but I have to. My anxiety is a *huge* issue that I have yet to get help with. So that's my next step...I look forward to posting more and especially reading what you all have to say everyday...**Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change. The courage to change the things I can. And the wisdom to know the difference.**

Yo 26 year old dude here. Been sober for a while in AA. Grew up being baby sat by AA members and hung out in the backs of meetings as a kid. I thought that mattered when I was trying to deal with my legal issues and getting sober but it didn't. The AA I "grew up" in was different than what I experienced as a sober kid. ..My advice? Just find a young people's meeting somewhere of you live in a populated area (any meeting if not) and just get sober. The rest will fall into place. Of course I'll answer any questions or whatever that you might have but yeah. Hit a meeting. ..*disclaimer* some people on this sub aren't big on AA and that's fine. Just my experience. Nothing wrong with their experience either. Also ignore Amy bad formatting or grammar I'm typing one handed in grid lock traffic. 
Hi and welcome!  May I ask is your father still around?  Have you spoken with him about this?..Best of luck to you.
Welcome /u/Mashable-tatoes to r/stopdrinking.  It's going to be interesting to read your post and comments as you go along particularly in light of your childhood exposure to recovery.  At this [link is my post called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) my guess is you will recognize the ideas there as conventional wisdom you heard over and over again from the time you were a child--except for the cool SD add-ons.  Good luck to you.
