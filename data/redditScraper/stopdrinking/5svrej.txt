6.5km in 39 minutes it's really hilly around here. Just under 6min a km. Slow as hell compared to before I fell off the wagon. Almost 100m of elevation gain.. .For the Americans and Brits among you thats 4 miles at 9.37 a mile. I have got very slow since I hit the drink again. It's about 280 ft of elevation gain. ..I felt awful today depressed and anxious but my shoes arrived to my workplace. Feel a lot better than I did. ..Anyone else running?

Heck yeah!  Training for the Providence Marathon in May -- hoping for  under 3 and a half.  I ran in high school but kept going to combat anxiety.  It works better than anything else I've found.  Plus I joined a running group after just being solo since running on HS teams.  It's been a lot of fun.  Glad to see your back getting your miles (km) in! 
Thats good! Don't put yourself down it's not about how far or fast you went. The endorphins you felt after are worth far more than the pride of running fast surely? 
For not having run in 3 yrs 9:37 isn't bad.  After 6-8 weeks of building a base your pace will start to drop naturally.  I'd say just be careful not to force the process and get yourself hurt.  Aerobic runs are the foundation.
Wait.  Brits use miles instead of km? 
Im back at it too and I LOVE it!..Good distance and time considering how long you "rested" ;)
