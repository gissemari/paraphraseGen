I'm officially on "staycation"! "Staycation" because I'm too poor to go anywhere cause for years I've wasted all my money on booze. No more of that shit though. Alcohol can suck it! I feel great being 31 days sober. ..I may struggle on Canada Day and just the thought of it is making me anxious. I'm not ready to be around my friends while they drink so I think swimming and an exhausting bike ride will be my plan for that day.

That sounds like a great day! You could plan a fun lunch or something for the middle of the day? A treat for yourself? :) congrats on passing a month!!!
