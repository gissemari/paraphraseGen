Its been 4 years since I stopped drinking its still a struggle now I am always thinking about drinking  but I remember the man I was when drinking I never want to go back to that it took me a long time to realise I needed help but once I accepted it I never looked back only forward

Congratulations on Your Sober Solar Circumnavigations!!!!
Still thinking of alcohol 4 years later wow. There has to be some way of retuning the brain to forget. I couldn't imagine how hard it is for you. Good job on four big years.
