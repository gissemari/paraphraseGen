I was kicking ass on my sobriety I've felt amazing but am have some business stresses so decided to come home to my home state for relax and vaca. I told myself I'd TRY not to drink and didn't till with family. Felt obligated but I still chose to drink. Been drinking 3 days now and feel exhausted and toxic. It's so pointless. 1 drink is amazing after that it's garbage. But having 54 days under my belt I remember how amazing I felt. And what I'm grateful for is the more I go back to drinking after I stop awhile the more and more I realize I hate it. So those of you struggling let it be and dont stress about it. Because I promise you you'll eventually realize how much drinking sucks and eventually you WILL quit. Keep the faith. I definitely am. Restarting sobriety once home mid week.

You got this!
There is such a huge difference between "I'll try to be sober" and "I will be sober." There was even a post about it here a while back but I can't find it now. I'm so glad you are done with "try" and moving onto "will." IWNDWYT!
It's amazing how every time I say: just the one. It never is just the one drink. ..It never is just the one day...The more than one drink thing I get. The fact that it is never one day flummoxes me.
