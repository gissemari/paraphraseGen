I've thrown away 7 days on a wild bender. Here's how it went. I started with a pint of fireball to settle me down for a plane ride. Then I managed to slam several beers. On the 2nd day I managed to by a liter of Vodka. My sister and brother in law were drinking and I couldn't resist the urge to join them. To their knowledge I was sober but the reality is I was black out drunk. The next several days following were basically rinse and repeat. Non-stop around the clock poisoning my temple... I had to take two days off work to try  passed out my sofa trying to figure out how I returned to this dismal place. Yesterday I barely made it to work. Spent half of the day throwing up and feeling awful. This morning I felt somewhat better but the guilt and shame remains. My body is purging the poison but dammit I am getting back in the game. There's 'got' to be away to conquer this beast! I simply can't be the first or the last to beat this sickness. Peace and blessings to you all! Stay sober and stay in the game. Recovering from relapse is absolute HELL!.

Get back up on that horse and have a go at it again!! Good luck to you and also IWNDWYT 
I am glad you are back! 
Thanks for sharing this as a reminder why not to start drinking again.
Thank you for the vivid gut-check reminder.  I'm starting to have "moderation" fantasies and I know things wouldn't turn out well if I went down that road.  Best to you and IWNDWYT.
Keep at it my dude. You've got this!
IWNDWYT!!
