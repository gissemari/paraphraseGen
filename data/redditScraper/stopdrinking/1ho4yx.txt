I've been reading here in the posts for a couple of weeks and I have to say - I'm extremely surprised...I'm a 24 year old Canadian. I have two black belts four published novels a university degree a family business to take over a college diploma a trade certification and I used to be extremely popular...Now I've realized I can also add "high-functioning alcoholic" to that list of accomplishments...After realizing I've been having a struggle with the bottle almost every morning when I wake up for work over the last couple of years - it's finally dawned on me what's been going on. ..Now it's about mustering the courage to do something about it...Thank you all for your stories - they've been extremely inspiring. I hope to have your strength and soon.
