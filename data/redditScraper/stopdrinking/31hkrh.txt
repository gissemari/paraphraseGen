I wrote this up tonight because I go to a lot of meetings at the detox center and I give a lot of people my phone number but by the time they get out they lose it or lose focus. I wanted an email so they could go back and reference it after they got out. I figured I'd post it here too just in case it helps anyone. I don't have a ton of time (6 month) but I've been pretty lucky to have some really good sobriety. ..(note: I edited it a little as some things were Atlanta area and the treatment center I go to specific)..Here is some info to help you get started. I have put this together and it is neither endorsed nor affiliated with any organization or treatment center. It is a basic outline of how i have gotten and continue to stay sober. If you need any clarification or just need to talk you can reach me at (904)-382-3011. ..The 5 Foundations:- put your recovery first because anything you put before your recovery you're probably going to end up losing. ..(TL:DR.Go to meetings and aftercare get a sponsor worth the steps. do some service pray and meditate)..1. Meetings- attend one 12 step meeting every day. AA NA CA- whatever get your daily dose. This is incredibly easy to do as meetings are literally all over the please. They are one hour long. Each meeting will ask for contributions (traditionally people throw in a dollar) but if it is your first meeting or you simply can't swing it it is absolutely no problem. Your goal should be to at least hit one meeting a day for the first three months. It will make it a habit and set a foundation for your recovery. ..2. Sponsor- Find a sponsor. You want someone to take you through the book and the 12 steps. This is critical in my opinion. You can start with a temporary sponsor. You can find one at almost any meeting. Don't worry about imposing or bothering them working with others is how we stay sober. They do not have to be your sponsor forever but it gives you someone who has been where you are at and has gotten to a place you want to get to. Call them every day (or how they suggest that you contact them). NOTE- it's not their job to do anything but help you. It's their job to provide the water it is not their job to drag you to the lake or to make you drink. They are the resource it's your responsibility to utilize this resource. ..3. Work the Steps- The steps are there to provide you the way to be free of the obsession of addiction help fix the reasons WHY you use and fill the hole that we have been trying to fill with drugs and/or alcohol..4. Spirit- Every morning read page 86 in the big book (upon awakening) and when you go to bed read page 87 (when we retire at night). Whether you are the pope or a card carrying Atheist we're all trying to get out of the prison of addiction and/or mental illness. Also take at least 10 minutes a day to meditate. If you struggle with being able to meditate I suggest sitting or laying down looking up guided meditation on you tube closing your eyes and letting the guide help you through. This will help slow down the racing thoughts and provide some well needed relaxation during a part of your program where this is at a premium. ..5. Service- Being new some people are a little scared of service and don't think they have anything to offer. This could not be further from the truth. If you have two days sober you've accomplished what took most of us years to get to.  If you're anything like me I could not connect with anyone by the time I came in. this slowly makes you feel a part of something again. It takes a while but long term service (working with another person suffering from addiction and/or mental illness) is probably the most important part of staying clean and sober. This doesn;t have to be high level- read at the meeting share put away charis greet make coffee. Do something to make yourself a part of the process....Attached are some links that can help you:..http://www.aaatlanta.org/meetings.php - a searchable tool for meetings in the greater atlanta area...www.primarypurposegroup.net - They do the Monday big book study at ridgeview and a Friday night speaker meeting in Sandy Springs the website has a bunch of AA speakers you can listen to. (It's my homegroup and features a bunch of guys who want to sponsor so if you want to find a sponsor it's a pretty easy place to find one). ..http://www.grscna.com/Meetings/List/area/South%20Atlanta - NA south Atlanta meetings..http://www.northatlantana.org/?page_id=2 - NA north Atlanta area meetings..google.com - seriously this should be #1. Anything you need to know google. it. It's all there. ..APPS:.These apps are available and are free:..Meeting finder - find any 12 step meeting no matter where you are. ..AA Big book - AA big book app from Georgia sobriety. the BIG BOOK of alcoholics anonymous is the basic text of AA and is AMAZING. it's 75 years old some of the terminology is a little old fashioned but the concepts for how to be free are timeless and invaluable. ..My spiritual toolkit -give you a "how long you've been sober" feature along with some prayers. ...This is by no means a comprehensive list and none of these suggestions override the direction of your sponsor or your treatment plan. If it comes down to something your sponsor or case manager tells you and something in this doc listen to them. If it's between something in this doc and your thinking that got you to the place where you are reading this go ahead and follow these suggestions. ..Thanks and good luck .Ray..
