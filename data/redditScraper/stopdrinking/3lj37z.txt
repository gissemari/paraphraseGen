I've found that putting myself down when I fuck up is counterproductive to my ultimate goal. If anything relapsing and knowing it was from boredom gives you an opportunity to realize the importance of having ways to deal with being bored so next time around you're better prepared. You can't help the rate others forgive you but you can certainly be gentle with yourself and build yourself up to come back from this stronger. 
You were doing good you're *still* good. You even know why you had a drink- you can use that for the next time you feel a wobble coming on. The dread will pass you've got this.
Well you came in here and told us about it so that's a good first step.  What's your plan to avoid reoccurrence?
Don't beat yourself up....Get up dust yourself off have another go..  ..It's a day at a time program so u only have the day..  Each day you wake up and don't drink is a bonus..  You can do it and everything happens for a reason..  ..
