I relapsed after eight and a half months of sobriety. I felt it coming because I got complacent and was less active in my recovery. I "forgot" how crappy my life used to be. I'm disappointed and mildly surprised by how bad it got in a matter of a week...I bartend for a living and what set me off was that I got a new job and was trying all the drinks to see how they are supposed to taste. I could have just smelled them but chose not to. I got "accidentally" drunk I knew that it was dangerous for me to even taste the drinks but thought I could handle it. I did not go into work with the intention of being intoxicated. And yet it happened because I chose to drink. Working in restaurants can definitely be dangerous to someone like myself that loses control when they consume alcohol. ..I thought I was invincible to relapse. I had multiple prior attempts to get sober the longest being about 70 days but this time I was over 8 months and I honestly thought I might be cured. Well fast forward nearly a week and I'm cleaning multiple bottles of hard liquor off the table. ..It's ridiculous you guys. I've followed this forum since before day 1 was content with lurking and didn't feel the need to post but I do now. It f-ing sucks starting over. But I'm back and that period of sobriety was not for nothing. I'm grateful that sober is my new normal. This pounding headache bloated belly sweat attack and anxiety is not worth it. I wish I never attempted to drink again but I can't change the past. But I just felt the need to get it out. ..I very much relate to this community. I stopped reading the posts a few weeks ago and it clearly didn't work too well for me. I hope someone reads this and can relate. I think sobriety is fantastic and I want mine back.
