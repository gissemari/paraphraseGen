First i want to start off with saying i have lost 40 pounds and on October 7th i will have 4 months with ZERO alcohol!! I look and feel amazing.  .My dad is still in the hospital; however they are working to transition him into a physical rehabilitation center so he can start working on walking again.  He is very weak and now is loosing his memory. He was telling me in the hospital how he helped someone move into their new apartment.  He has been in the hospital for almost a month now :( He did not and could not have helped anyone move anything..My daughter is still in a treatment center out of state.  The longer she is there the more i realize this is all up to her.  If she come back and wants to remain clean she has to want it.  I have been fighting to keep her from coming back for fear of her relapsing. This is not something i can control so i am letting go of this and praying for her.  My husband and i are making good progress. We are working on getting the business off the ground together.  This is leaps and bounds were i was 4 month ago.  So many of you gave me hope when i felt all was lost i cannot express how grateful i am for that or how much i needed it just at the time you delivered!.Keep sobering on my cool peeps we are not drinking today and it feels fabulous!!!

It's good to read that things are looking up. ..Congrats on persevering through the difficult situations / relationships *and* maintaining your sobriety. 
I am glad to hear you're holding together nicely and making good progress where you can. I know it's hard to accept the things that are outside of my control especially the ones that count (family stuff) so I admire the strength you're showing. I will not drink with you today!
