I don't like talking about  myself a lot but i think posting something here can help me commit more. I am sober since 06.02.2019 (for Americans: 02/06/2019). Until New Years Eve i was sober for 5 weeks but then i went on a one month drinking spree while using pills so i can drink more without throwing up or falling asleep...I hit a crucial point because i started to buy my alcohol while i was really drunk. Normaly if i there is alcohol in my home i drink it. It's easier to pass by it in the store and not take any...I'm very anxious alcohol helps. But the more i drink the more anxious  sober me gets. I realised that now. My withdrawal was and is basically me being in full panic all day. It sucks...So i tried another drug (opioid) to stop my panic as alternative to alcohol. Obviously i took too much so it felt like being too drunk so i thought to myself: This feels exactly as bad what are you even doing. Now i got alcohol and opiods in my house. At least now i know Aclohol is the drug of my choice. Awesomesauce. Paid lots of money for that and the alcohol (while drunk) and i don't wanna see it but also can't throw it away. ..When i was sober before i didn't feel good. I didn't feel healthier or happier or anything. It's a goddamn struggle. You read about all those people feeling happy and good that they quit but i didn't have any of this when i stopped before. It's all a lie. All my nightmares made every morning feel like a hangover whenever i saw alcohol anywhere i got triggered so hard and all i thought about is "oh my god i want a drink to just forget this life". If it's such a struggle it's hard to keep going. I'm not an alcoholic just an alcohol abuser i guess. If i'm happy i don't need a drop. When i was young i just cut myself at some point i swapped it for alcohol...I gained a lot of weight again which sucks because i lost weight before and even scraped the  normal weight  range. I also wasted so much money which i really don't have...Reasons i don't want to drink: to lose weight again; to not land on the street because of no money; because i absolutely hate that feeling when you wake up in the morning and you know you weren't in control of yourself when drunk; because my anxiety is unbearable without alcohol (unless i stopped some days before);..It's hard but maybe i can do it. Who knows. Many other people here did before.

I'm on the end of Day 6 and I still have anxiety and every night I wake up several times from horrific nightmares my sleep has been very poor. I don't know how it is for you but even this troubled anxious terror ridden sober sleep is making me more well rested than the most restful peaceful drunk sleep I've ever had and that for hours longer.  ...I've been reading and it seems post alcohol withdrawal is causing a lot of anxiety for me as my brain keeps expecting me to drink it and hasn't quite healed or rewired itself to create some of its own chemicals it relied on alcohol on before. At least I think I read that right.  ...Long story short I'm going through anxiety right now because for me it seems the only way out of this anxiety is through it. I hope you make the choice to not drink today because I think alcohol wont take away the anxiety it will just delay it for awhile (in my experience). IWNDWYT
I understand your anxiety and panic all day.  I've been walking circles at work (construction) and fidgety and can't sit still.  It has to get better I imagine I'm still early in recovery.  Hardest part is seeing MYSELF without the beer goggles and not having the facade of grandeur from alcohol or the numbness from a hangover.  I believe we're meant to feel the full range of life though and I want to.  Every experience shapes and (can) strengthens us.
