Today is the morning of my day two and I can already tell it's going to be a difficult time. I tried to fix things up with my ex girlfriend and yesterday she told me it's over forever and we can't ever be fixed. All the bad times in our relationship were caused by my drinking and she shouldn't have to live like that honestly she's right I wouldn't want to be with someone like me either. She asked me to be honest with myself and get help so that's what I'm trying to do. I'm hoping the next time I talk to her it can be a success story. I'm not even sure if I'm doing this for her or myself but I can figure that out later I just need to start to make a positive change in my life. Struggling with her not wanting to ever be with me again is making it all really tough but I'm glad that I found this community and hope that I can make it through. I'm hoping for the best and here goes to another day. Just trying to stay in the right headspace.

Welcome. IWNDWYT 
Welcome! I found that fixing myself fixed a lot of the problems around me as well. 
I'm on day two also. I'm sorry you're going through heartache on top of all this. ..I have decided that despite my deep loneliness I can't even consider trying to bring another person into my life until I've learned to love myself. But like REALLY love myself for real this time...I think if you take the time to focus on your recovery you'll be that success story and the right things will come along to complement that.
