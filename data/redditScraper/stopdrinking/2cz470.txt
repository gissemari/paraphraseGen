I have a spiral I keep next to my computer that I keep bits and pieces of all of your posts.  I write down your words  your advice your inspirational quotesyour struggles and triumphs.  In 75 days I have gathered pages and pages of notes.  I also write down my own thoughts my struggles my goals and victories.  I haven't had a real hurdle yet where I was really tempted to drink but if I do I plan on reading all of my notes.  I know it will help me overcome any temptations to drink. Happy Sober Friday everyone :)

Impressive!
Great idea/u/gardenofthoughts ..This is something I may start doing as well. There is so many good one liners and inspirational things I read on here and at the time make such a profound impact on me only to forget half of them by days end. Well not forget but more like a generalization of remembering. Time to start jotting them down like you. Thanks for the post. And happy sober Friday to you too.  
You make me want to post better stuff! Here's my try for today: Alcohol was not the problem it was a solution that no longer works. Thankfully I have a much healthier solution today. 
I always think of this quote from Yoda*"Once you start down the dark path [drinking again] forever will it dominate your destiny; consume you it will!"* 
I think people underestimate just how much journals help in life. It's a great way to get shit off your chest/mind and it's a good reference to go back to.
I've kept my share of helpful snippets too. ..For a while /u/offtherocks was trying to get a collection of bookmarks going at [diigo](https://groups.diigo.com/group/reddit_stopdrinking). There's also a [collected comments thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2cx3ta/collected_comments_part_deux/) for sharing particularly helpful comments.
What an awesome idea!
&gt;  I haven't had a real hurdle yet where I was really tempted to drink...Somehow I doubt that's true considering you've got 75 days and a sober Mexican vacation under your belt....Credit where credit is due.  Achieving 75 days is overcoming an incredible hurdle....A common bad habit we problem drinkers have is finding any reason to beat on ourselves and belittle our own achievements....You should be insufferably puffed up with pride for all the hurdles you've overcome so far....Great job..
I don't know why but this really helped.  Thanks.  
Someone mentioned evernote a while ago.  Lets you copy &amp; paste to a desktop site. Then you can organize etc.  https://evernote.com/
I've been doing this a while too. I've got an electronic notebook (evernote and u/mwants suggests) full of quotes and information from here and the many useful links that folks have provided. I have a pocket notebook too where I keep my ABC and CBA worksheets and other notes. I've flipped through both multiple times when I need some support or strength against temptation.

Take some pictures and post them here.  :)
That is a great idea.  Well done on you 75 days.
If anyone asks you to drink tell them "I'm allergic I break out in handcuffs"
That's a great idea!  I want to try it too.
I do the same! It's very helpful. It's kind of my "greatest hits" of SD and I have all of my favorite posts and replies in a word document. Sometimes I add notes and relate it to my own alcoholism. Glad to know I'm not the only one doing it haha
