I'm obviously only two and a half days in but I had $10 to blow today and I went to buy some earbuds. I let that little voice get the best of me though and spent the change on a beer. I only took a few sips and dumped the rest out on the street then headed home to watch football. I felt absolutely nothing from it other than it made me a tiny bit tired. I'm not counting it as a relapse. Would you?..edit: went with popular opinion and reset me badge. Guess I'll consider it a relapse.

For myself yes I would count it.  Only because I can anticipate the slippery slope as the few sips turn into a few more sips next time.......
I would count it but I'm an "all or nothing" thinker. You should do whatever feels right for you.
If you swallowed an alcoholic drink then yep..IWNDWYT
problem for me is if I let my self "get away with" a couple of sips then I'd get into the numbers game size of sips alcoholic content speed of sips what's a couple?  Can I use a mormon family as an example. How many wives did Brigham Young have?  Yeah that's a couple.....I'm an alcoholic that's how I think.  Still.  ..zero cuts all that out...
Yes.
For me consciously consuming an alcoholic beverage is a relapse.
For myself I would have to reset. Mainly because it was a conscious decision to buy and consume. But it's your badge and your decision...
Yes
I respectfully disagree. I would think that associating being strong enough to dump it out as a failure will lead to negative thinking instead of positive. It's a personal choice on where you stand with it.
