Hey guys.  I've told my story before so I don't want to go into it again but cliff's notes: had been sober for 3+ years relapsed about six months ago drinking off and on again since...I'm making another effort now and I've gotten back in touch with my doctor went back on my anti depressants and he also gave me naltrexone to help with the cravings.  It actually seems to be working quite well...However This is the first of my "restarts" where it feels real.  I'm going through the crazy depression I had back when I was trying to quit the first go round.  I'd usually turn to my wife however she is understandably not happy with me.  I feel like a total failure.  I know that these feelings go away but right now that thought doesn't help.  Don't have much motivation for anything no appetite nothing sounds fun.  ..I don't mean this to be a pity party and I imagine most everyone here has been through this so any words of encouragement/thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

"If you're going through hell keep going" - Winston Churchill ..Have you tried taking a walk? Listen to a new podcast or audiobook or maybe some new tunes. Let your mind kind of glaze over and take in the breathing patterns focus on all the little positive things and beauty of nature (or concrete depending on where you live).
