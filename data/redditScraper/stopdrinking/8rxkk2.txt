First of all why haven't I ever heard of the seriousness of alcohol withdrawal until today? I'm 22 recently graduated college and had NO idea that alcohol withdrawal can kill you. Never heard of Delirium Tremens before today either and that sounds absolutely horrifying. I feel like there should be more education and awareness surrounding this... anyway......I'm trying to read up on it but most sources that I find describing the issue are pretty vague. Such as  heavy drinkers should taper off alcohol gradually as to prevent dangerous withdrawal symptoms . ..What constitutes a heavy drinker? Like I said I'm 22 I drank a lot the last few years in college blacked out here and there in the beginning but since hangovers became worse and I graduated I don't binge drink anymore. However I typically will have a drink or two after work not every day but almost every day. Maybe once a week I'll have 4 or so drinks. Even though I don't drink heavily each day I don't think I've gone a whole week without one single drink in a year or so. ..Does  heavy drinking  constitute being drunk all the time and binge drinking every day? Or are my habits considered heavy enough for alcohol withdrawal?..Also most sources say to  gradually taper off  but again so vague. Does it mean over the course of a week or 3 months or 6 months or??? ..On a final note my father is a raging alcoholic (I am sadly confident his addiction will kill him) and he tries to quit cold turkey every month or so. Refuses to see a doctor or listen to anyone who tells him it's a bad idea. Always relapses. Now I fear he's in serious danger of withdrawal seizures or heart failure. Shit alcohol is scary.

You are not in danger of experiencing alcohol withdrawal but your father definitely is. Having a few drinks and waking up the next day and going about your business means you're not withdrawing. If in your heavy drinking days you ever woke up after a heavy binge and your hands were shaking and you were sweating and feeling feverish and jumpy thats a little taste of withdrawal. If your father truly wants to quit he should do so through a rehab program because it is not safe for him to do so by himself cold turkey. 
If you check the sidebar of the r/alcoholism subreddit there are two self evaluation resources that may help you determine how a medical professional might view your alcohol use.
