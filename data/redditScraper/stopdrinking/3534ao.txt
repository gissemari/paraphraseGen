[First post](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/31kbbj/got_a_dui_last_night/)..[Second post](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/31p43w/update_got_a_dui_last_night/)..[Third post](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/32clu0/a_week_ago_today_i_was_in_jail/)..It has been one month since I relapsed after 106 days got a DUI and ended up in jail. I am proud to say that I am still sober after 30 days. It's been hard  but honestly not as hard as I anticipated. Last time I always had in the back of my mind that "oh this is just temporary I'll be able to drink again" and it helped me get through the each day. I had convinced myself that I didn't have a drinking problem I just needed to take a break for awhile. Well this time I'm not kidding myself this is the real deal and not a temporary stop. I'm in this for the long haul and taking sobriety as serious as I have anything in my life. This time all my friends know my parents know colleagues everyone who is important in my life. I know I can't get through this myself and everyone has been incredibly helpful. ..It surprising how much we underestimate our friends and family sometimes. I was convinced my parents would disown me because I had a problem my friends wouldn't want to hang out everyone would judge me make fun of me whatever. That was the complete opposite of what happened. My parents have been the most supportive people ever my friends have been understanding when I tell them I can't go out even suggesting other non-drinking activities so we could all hang out.  I believe this has made the last month much easier than the last time I tried. Not having to hide (I realize how stupid that sounds now) that I didn't drink. Being open and honest with everyone by simply saying "I don't drink anymore" not that "oh i'm taking a break" has been a huge relief. ..Thanks again for all your support and kind words. This community has been as much if not more help than any of my friends and family. Here's to not drinking today.

Not until my life got to a point of bleak loneliness and absolute terror was I willing to admit that I was sick and needed help...I had tried and failed using everything I could think of to stay sober and for a while I was successful but eventually I had to drink again...Then I realized I'm a very sick man...I got the help I needed in Alcoholics Anonymous. 
Congrats on your realization! Honesty is very important if I want to stay sober. I was so afraid of admitting I had a problem because then there's no turning back. I will never be able to drink and claim that I didn't know what would happen...But that's a relief now. I always knew deep down what would happen: I would get drunk. And I would prefer being drunk by myself than being with anyone else. Thankfully that was not entirely true and something finally snapped inside me and I admitted that I did need help and I am an alcoholic. I am so much happier now and I can connect with those I love! And I can actually love which has been like nothing I could have imagined...One day at a time we can stay sober and grow as human beings together!
This post is very inspiring. I agree 100%...talking to your friends and family about your problem and your plan are so so so important. Once they're all on board life gets so much easier. Keep up the great work!
So inspiring! So much sense in your post. Great changes!
Congratulations on 31 days. Keep coming back!
I was amazed at the support I received from my family too.  They actually knew I was an alkie before I did and I think they were just relieved. They continue to support me and some times even ask me for advice.  Not that is different \o/
