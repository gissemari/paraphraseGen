-Dr. Seuss. ..To me this quote represents my struggle with alcohol addiction and the journey to sobriety. When I've been in the middle of a binge how hard it was to see what I was doing to myself and where I was headed. I thought I was happy but really I was just under the spell of booze and letting it go was like ending a long term relationship. ..Through the withdrawal I certainly wasn't having much fun and making it those few days without sleep and unable to eat was no easy task. When I finally became "un-slumped" I was so relieved to finally feel in control...Now as I type this I feel like this quote represents those weak moments we all have. We may feel tense awkward irritated or a whole other range of emotions when temptation comes knocking on our door while we're in a slump and sometimes it's not easy to look the other way. But the reward for working through it and telling yourself that today is not the day is making the un-slumping easier each time. As we learn our weaknesses strengths and tools to allow our mind to focus on something more positive and productive we become stronger and develop as a better person. Temptation is like a universal drug it's on every corner in every alleyway and in the back of our mind. We as individuals have to remain vigilant in the war on temptation.
