Hey guys!!! Happy Wednesday!! WuW is where we calibrate our week check in and see how our SD buds are doing and support each other in our sobriety.  Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type with us!..**Triumph:** I've been finishing up some rather old and forgotten art projects lately.  Lots of collages I started and hadn't really worked on in months.  Some stuff has been untouched for over a year.  For a while I didn't want to make art or write without drinking because that had often been a part of my routine.  I've found it easier to get into the creative mood without substances lately.  Part of it was just making myself sit down and do it but part of me genuinely feels creative and inspired in a way I haven't felt in months. I'm glad to finish up some old projects while I start brainstorming new ones...**Struggle:**  Two things.  I haven't been sleeping well.  Bad dreams about past trauma long conversations into late hours and adjusting to how my antidepressants effect my energy levels have all contributed to a very sleepy panda.  That and I am starting to regret applying for certain jobs.  It's a vicious cycle where I feel bad if I don't try to change my situation but once I start really applying I feel as if I'm not good enough for anything other than my current positions...**General Chat:** So it's that time of the year. I know some folks are already dealing with holiday work parties and other holiday obligations.  Anything about this season stressing you out already?  Anything about it your anticipating?  I tend to avoid parties and places where people are drinking so that's not really on my list and I don't have family to deal with.  I am holiday stressing though: my amazon tracking says some packages have been delivered but they aren't on my doorstep.  I spent $50 bucks on twinkling holiday lights and I want--nay need--them.  Not sure how I can possibly celebrate the [kittens' first christmas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-clZalhSXs) without holiday lights. 
----------immediate responses--------

**Triumph** - I graduated finally! I gave up on this years back!..**Struggle / Chat** - Family is in turmoil this year so Christmas will likely be a small home afffair which suits me fine. Christmas eve will be with family and new additions (who seem to like their drink) I'm feeling a little uncomfortable so I've got an escape plan locked in. New years I think will be with friends like last year having games to play helped last year.
**Triumph:** I am going to Canada on Saturday! Just finishing up a lot of loose ends at work and only have two days of work before FOUR WEEKS OFF! Super excited to see my family (especially my nearly two year old niece) to meet one of my SD friends IRL in Vancouver and to have a white Christmas. I love Melbourne but Christmas here isn't the same.  ..**Struggle:** I'm on a secondment at work and my contract finished in 9 days. I've been told verbally they will extend it for 12 months have formally interviewed for the role had my references checked etc but I still don't have any paperwork to say that I'm staying in this job. I love this job and think not knowing what will happen when I get back (even though I've been told time and time again not to worry) may put a damper on my holiday. Last thing I want to do is check my work emails every day to see if anything has come through while I should be spending time with my family.....**General Chat:** I legitimately didn't see this post and [just posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3w1og4/not_feeling_great_about_this_work_christmas_party/) something about a work party and skipping it. I'll maybe go to the one tomorrow but will decide that at the time based on how I'm feeling.  
Triumph: Doing ok in community college. Yipee...Struggles: Laying awake at 2:30 in my childhood bedroom at 26 years old because I can't sleep and trying to pinpoint when exactly when my life went to absolute shit. Deleted tinder and okcupid because I'm not kidding myself anymore. It ain't gonna happen...General Chat: I'm a groomsman at a wedding on NYE and have been dreading it for months. I get to hang out with successful financially independent friends who are in relationships and have careers while I sit quietly and wonder when it will be socially acceptable to call it a night and retreat to my hotel room.
TRIUMPH: I'm one essay away from college graduation. Bring. It. On.       .STRUGGLE: I'm new to this and managed only 4 days without a drink but yesterday had to reset my badge. BUT 4 days is the longest I've gone without a drink in years so I'm trying to look at the positive side.       .GENERAL: now I'm close to finishing my studies (it's taken a loooong time) I'm ready to look for a new job. Possibly move to a new city?We'll see. It's kind of frightening to think about.
**Triumph:**  I went to two parties this weekend.  Lots of alcohol served.  I didn't think about drinking...**Struggle:**  my ex won't speak to me even though I am nearly 4 months without drinking.  I had some hope but it is likely not going to happen...**General chat:**  lots of good things planned this month.  Looking forward to the possibility of a sober Christmas.

**Triumph(s):** As I posted about in its own post I made it through my 10-hour office Christmas drinking marathon without actually drinking at all. It was pretty heroic if I may say so...Even better I've made an awesome new connection in the last month.  We've had three dates and we chat nearly every day. ..**Struggle:** My anxiety has been pretty swingy lately. Some days I'm extremely level and other days I just get eaten up. I nearly drank yesterday. I was at a bar with my date and the shot was literally placed in front of me. Somehow I managed to keep my commitment to sobriety. It was a near thing. Luckily I think our relationship has progressed to the point that not every date will involve going out to bars. Although many of them still will I'm sure. I have to be more mindful in the future and maybe beg off the bar on a day when my anxiety is already sky-high...I've barely gotten any work done lately -- my work just doesn't seem important in the context of the rest of my life: sobriety Christmas working on my art this new relationship. But it's getting better. 
**Triumph:**  Day 1 of MM done.  Two units only which is about as little as I've done in six months.  Getting up early to hit a morning AA meeting.
**Triumph**:  I've gone to three meetings this week and am really going to push for 90 in 90.  I also bought The Big Book this a.m...**Struggle**This season tends to leave me feeling a little bedraggled.  I feel like I give and give and give and make sure everyone has what THEY need and that everything is as perfect as possible and at the end of the day I'm left feeling very spent and feeling like I "deserve" to drink...**General Chat** I will be REALLY glad when my 3 years old's birthday party is all said and done this weekend!!
**Triumph**: After years of half ass trying to get back into making music I've finally been able to put in some real time thanks to not going out and drinking! Amazing how much time there actually is to learn what you love!..**Struggle**: Definitely felt some craving and loneliness during the weekend. Wanted to go out and bar hop with friends and etc. but it wasn't too bad. Work during the day and music during the night keeps me occupied!..**General Chat**: I'm kind of terrified of what dating will be like now with out the help of alcohol. If I think back all my first dates or any kind of relationship I've had always had the help of alcohol: "let's grab a drink!" or we met at a bar. Anyone have any tips or insights on what dating is like without it? I have yet to try it.
**Triumph** - I'm wrapping up my first semester in college! I found out that I'll be passing World Lit with a hundred percent! I should also be passing all my other classes with A's minus History. I took several years off after high school to "find myself." I ended up finding myself in the bottle. It's amazing how much better life is now that I'm sober...**Struggle** - Two more finals left. I also went through two breakups. I wouldn't really call that a struggle though because I didn't really let it affect my serenity or sobriety. I'm in control of my serenity and nobody can alter it. Plus now that I'm single I can focus on going to meetings everyday again. 
**Triumph**: I'm almost to a week I have been able to overcome the MANY cravings with distracting myself talking to my wife about them.  She's the fucking best.  Drunk self didn't deserve her.  I;m gonna make that up with sober self.  This is my first attempt at sobriety I wasn't expecting to be "this successful."  At all. You guys got me through it.  I've made it to 4 AA meetings in a row.  This is helping me a lot I think...**Struggle:**  I'm leaving town for the holidays for 2 weeks starting next Friday.  I checked the meeting schedule where I'm going (a beach town where my parents live) and I'm disappointed that I won't be able to go to the same meeting group every night.  The only daily meeting is in the morning which I could make work but my mother has been going to that meeting for the last year or so.  I like the anonymity of my meetings it's not that I don't want to see her in the meetings I just don't think I would get as much out of it.  And awkward?  And meeting people is keeping me coming back to the meetings.  My mom being there could really change that.  And she doesn't like my smoking.  Anyway just lots of anxiety about that.  I don't think I'm acting very grown-up about that but it's how I feel.  Shoot me...**General:**  Just a huge THANK YOU to all the supportive folks on here.  Glad I joined here.  You got me going you're keeping me going.
**Triumph:** I'm under 160 pounds for the first time since before I was 21.  I was 180 when I first stopped drinking.  I've got all these shirts that were too small that I'm looking good in so it's like a new wardrobe!..**Struggle:** I still smoke more pot than I should and while I'm able to be productive my fiancee just sits on the couch most nights and looks at her phone.  I need to be better and more supportive for her because she's not wanting to do anything social has zero hobbies and won't bring herself to look for a new therapist.  ..**General Chat:** I'm not a fan of Christmas and this was the year I told my family that I'm just straight up opting out.  I couldn't afford to visit them anyway this year but I didn't want to deal with any of it.  I'm not a holiday person at all and just always want to get to January 1 as quickly as possible.  
Triumph: I applied for a new job that would pay about twice what I get paid now. I'm excited but nervous. My friend works there and I'm more than qualified but I'm nervous I won't get it and nervous I will..Struggle: my husband and I have been fighting and divorce has been mentioned. Our issues have really come to a boil now that I'm not drinking with him. My sobriety scares the crap out of him I know he isn't ready to get sober and I can't control that. Super scared our relationship has been so intertwined with booze since the beginning. .Chat: although there is never enough money I've been having fun shopping for the kids' Christmas and their excitement definitely makes Christmas more fun. My parents will be out of the country so just our immediate family this year at home. Got to start wrapping soon:)
What's up Wednesday!..Triumph:. I'm still sober and it's the time of year (one of them) that is hardest for me. It's truly an amazing thing for me not to drink. My active participation in SD every day is what keeps me sober. Today I know that. That's my biggest triumph...Struggle: .Life on life's terms is hard for me to do. I'm infinitely better than I was when drinking but I still have a lot to change about myself. Mostly just little things but I try really hard to be my best self and I'm very critical of myself because that is just who I am...General chat:.This is my longest time sober so I'm learning still. I have lots of noise in my head and I question myself but overall I suppose I'm doing all right. I miss my sponsor. He passed away sober in 2012. He was a good friend and helped me a lot he would be so happy to know that I'm sober today though.
