I've been a severe alcoholic for 3 years. It started due to my depression because I already gave up on living and didn't care about my liver or any other consequences. I chugged Vodka all day and all night and actually almost died of it one time due to me falling into a bush wasted and not able to get out of there alone in winter only wearing hot pants and a tank top. I worked on my depression and am still healing but nowhere near giving up but I just didn't stop drinking. For almost one year I stayed away from strong liqueur like Vodka or Rum but frank beer everyday. In late 2018 I fell back into my old pattern of getting wasted every night. I realized that I wanted it to stop completely because I wanted to be a better person for myself my family and my boyfriend. So from Dec 1st 2018 I stopped drinking. I only drank something on Christmas and New Years (Not much very little actually) and will only drink something again for special occasions and birthdays because I know that I have it under control now and won't relapse because of one or two drinks..Fast forward to today. I feel great without alcohol I'm a lot more active take more care of myself and I treat other people better. I don't miss alcohol because I like myself sober I'm a better person. But my addiction is trying to make it back. I think about drinks all the time I have this really strong urge to go into the supermarket and get myself just one beer. I'm not willing to give into this urge I'm strong. But I'm scared..I don't want to fall back and I need some motivation from people that know how it feels that have been where I have been..Please tell me how great sobriety is and how much worth it is to keep going. I need to hear it from someone thats has also been struggling.

It helps me to understand why I think I want that one beer so much.  Is it just flavor?  Is it the buzz?  If it is the buzz I know one won't be good enough.  Is it social interaction to have it with friends?  Is it to shut the brain off (though I know for a fact that takes me more than one)?..But what is the why and then is there another way to get that?  Like today a lot of people have FOMO but I don't have to drink to not miss out.  I can go to the bars and the parties and I can enjoy the day with my friends without ever drinking...Stay strong and I hope you can figure out your why's.
