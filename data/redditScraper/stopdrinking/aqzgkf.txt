In celebration of V day and my 50 Day sober streak I decided to go out with the hubs and celebrate with an over the top high caloric meal (I've also been dieting for 30 days as part of my overall journey to wellness with great results). Of course as soon as we sit down there is complementary champagne for this adorable couple. Without hesitation I pushed my free sparkly boozy deliciousnous towards the hubs and ordered myself a fancy NA beer while explaining to the server that I don't drink alcohol proudly. Lucky hubby got extra bubbly...good for him.  ..I ordered a light dinner of salad and an appetizer to save room for the crazy huge dessert I had been thinking about all day. When the time came for dessert I was soooooo excited for the baked Alaska for 2 (yes 2....and I didn't even share cause it's all about me). When my beautifully plated gorgeous baked Alaska showed up I immediately dig in!!! Before the spoon could even make it to my mouth my nose was burning with the smell of high proof liquor. Obviously used to  flamb   the shit out of the meringue. Also the sponge cake portion of the dessert was literally soaked in a few shots of 151 proof! ..I put the fork down in defeat and pushed the plate away. Told my husband my dessert was ruined and I'd just eat some ice cream at home.  . He immediately wanted to rectify the situation and return the dessert as I was very clear that I don't do alcohol in the beginning. I didn't want to call attention to it so instead we dissected the booze covered sponge cake off the dessert scraped away the top potion with the flamb  boozy crust and I went on to devour what would have been too large of a dessert for one person to eat anyway. ..The server noticed me doing this and felt bad. It was a special and she had no idea there was booze on it. No harm no foul and in the end comped appetizers. ..And that ladies and gentlemen is how I almost relapsed via baked Alaska.
