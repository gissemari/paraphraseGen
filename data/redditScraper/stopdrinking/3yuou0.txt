I've been struggling today with feeling down.  I have no plans for NYE tomorrow.  I've been struggling with whether going out or staying home would be best for my sobriety.  I thought offering to watch my nephews for their parents would be a good idea but as it turns out my services are not needed.  I logged onto SD read some powerful shares and felt better.  Then I looked at the sidebar and realized tomorrow if day 50 for me.  Still don't know what my plans are tomorrow night but I know that I will not be drinking no matter what!

Brilliant the big 50.
Awesome!! Good for you!!
Christmas was my 2 month. It helped get me through a day I hate. Stay focused my friend!
50 days!!! ..By the way alone on NYE I'd go to an AA meeting.  There are parties everywhere among the AA meetings.
Yay! \o/
