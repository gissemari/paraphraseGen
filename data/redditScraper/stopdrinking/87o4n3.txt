I know a lot of people struggle with this too.  This is the time of the evening where I pour my glass(es) of wine and relax.  Instead I'm anxiously pacing around the house and eating almond butter out of the jar.  I'm trying to continue the ritual with seltzer but...it's just not the same.  I'm hoping to one day not feel the cravings and the sadness that goes with it..

You will thank yourself 
When you do the Seltzer do you drink it from a wine glass? I know that sounds silly but I do. Something about holding the glass. Then I light some candles put on some Enya (or whatever chill music you want) and just be. These days I'm over the need to hold the glass and just my sparkling beverage from the can but that came with time and distance on the cravings and learning my new normal. ..You can do this. Only a couple of more hours until tomorrow. And you won't be hungover on almond butter :) ..I will not drink with you tonight. .

That Almond butter jams your mouth up good.  ...It gets so much easier promise.  I don't even remember when I last had a craving or a depression spiral.
