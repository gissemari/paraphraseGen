*Ninja Edit: The title might be misleading. Even though I didn't grab a bottle of beer or a shot glass that doesn't necessarily mean I wasn't close to relapsing. Every thought in my head was my remembering how easy it was to let alcohol kind of calm me. Even though I didn't put a glass to my lips or even think about it I think my body subconsciously was crying out for it. God... it's hard...I just sat there wondering if I would be able to read out Words Against Humanity without stuttering. I wondered if I could say the word Saturday correctly after repeating it in my head dozens of times while watching the 40th anniversary of SNL with friends. It's something I've done most of my life word oversaturation...I don't know what it is. Call it social anxiety. Call it ADD. For some reason my mind races. It might be egotism. I do feel as if a spotlight is on me all the time. I try and shake it off and go out just to force me out of my comfort zone. I believe I can beat my anxieties but fuck it's hard...I didn't come close to relapsing but I sure as hell feel like I'm suffering right now. I miss being able to talk freely and without a worry. I hate that I stayed in my seat and didn't say a word to that girl right beside me. But I know that a shot of alcohol is just a lie. I know I have to fix this the right way. A glass of scotch will just push these problems for later. That bottle of beer will just cause my issues to pile up...I might not be able to do this on my own but Im trying. I don't want to see my doctor and substitute booze for antianxiety meds. Theres a possibilty that I have some kind of undiagnosed ADD. Maybe it's treatable and I may have to see my doctor about it but right now I want to be myself my true self and Im willing to fight for it. Im not complaining really. I'm just saying it's fucking hard. I guess it's like they say anything worth having is worth fighting for. So I'm going to continue fighting tooth and nail...I just thought I'd share how hard today was. Especially when people close to me tell me to loosen up. Just be myself. I wish on every night like tonight that it was that easy...I'm trying man. I'm doing the best I can. I knew these bad days would come. Ive read about it and seen other people talk about it. But I promised myself I would see this through. And I will...I hate alcohol. I hate the lies it told me and the person it made me believe I wasnt. I've always been the same person. I just tricked myself for so long. Now I need to just find myself again. It's so disheartening to see how much of a vice grip alcohol had over me these past 10 years. But I'm still alive. Im going to do whatever I can to find myself again if it takes 10 days or 10 years.

I think you do need to see a doctor re your anxiety.  Repeating words over and over can be a sign of OCD - which is a lot to do with anxiety.  If you can resolve that issue you won't be seeing alcohol as an unmedicated treatment which it's been for you...Let us know if they diagnose anything...Good on you for remaining sober!  :)
I would not dismiss the idea of medication at least temporarily.  Taking a pill to reduce a painful symptom is not the same thing as drowning your symptoms under a bottle of booze.  The medication won't distort your thinking or turn you into a shambling idiot or make you forget what you did last night.  It will take the edge off.  And if you're taking the medication while also engaging in therapy then what you're doing is treating your anxiety--not drowning it.  Booze hides your symptoms shoves them down into a hole of forgetfulness--but they're still their untreated getting worse as time goes by and you do nothing about them.  Proper medication with therapy exposes your anxiety lets you see it for what it is and with luck and persistence helps you learn to deal with it in a healthy and functional way. ..I would also recommend trying meditation.  Find a group near you--anything will do--Buddhism Hinduism Mindfulness if you're not into the whole religion thing.  And learn to sit and breath.  You will learn over time that you are not your thoughts and your thoughts don't control you (unless you let them).  
Sounds like Social Anxiety though it's never good to Dx over the internet good news is Tx is CBT..http://www.helpguide.org/articles/anxiety/social-anxiety-disorder-and-social-phobia.htm
