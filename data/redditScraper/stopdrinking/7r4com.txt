Sorry if the title seems like clickbait!.So I just got home from work and my partner asked if I would go to the shop and get her a Bottle of wine she is in her PJs and there is a foot of snow outside. Anyway I went and bought 1 bottle not 2 or 3 but 1 ! None for me...Feels like I'm gaining some control over this malarkey but at the risk of repeating myself does anyone still have nightmares after 16 days? I'm falling asleep better but waking up at 3.15 ish EVERY night with quite bizarre/frightning dreams then struggling to get back to sleep...So to recap felling better not great sleeping better for a short while but overall loving sobriety..thanks to everyone on this sub it helps so much.

It gets easier each day.  Congrats on 16 days!
Yep nightmares can take a while to go away. I still get one from time to time. Less often as time goes on and they lose power over time too. Eventually it's (almost) a little funny...Good deal on feeling and sleeping better overall. I think you'll see it get even better. Congrats! I will not drink with you today.
I have been having nightmares and waking up also. But still feel more rested than when drinking weird right? ..Tonight I'll toast my water my gf will toast her wine. To not drinking!
