I wanted to try and thank you all with a hopefully helpful hip-hop rap about fighting the good fight. So here's what I came up with. The "rap" song is on YouTube ([Here's the Rap Song](https://youtu.be/tEAT5RvmA0A)) if you simply search:  IWNDWYT Rap    it'll come up...then you can follow along with the lyrics below. I can't thank you all enough for your love and support through this journey!..&amp;#x200B;..Do you wanna be alive or do you want to fucking die at the age of 45..Leaving your loved ones behind.....is that really what you want for your legacy . that you didn't even try?..Time after time we relentlessly imbibe  . On an endlessly toxic water-slide.  . Our shots aren't fired from any Glock 9 but they might as well be since we're drinking turpentine.   . ..Get up off the couch or the bed or the lawn take that fucking bottle and flush it down the john.  . ..Everyone's facing a battle so get up and FIGHT  . Nobody's forcing you to buy that six pack so don't do it all right?  . ..You get one body don't fuck it up.  . Downing beers cuz you're down on your luck.  . ..Know that You ARE loved at the very least by EVERYONE here so please for the love of God don't pick up that beer.  . ..I guarantee you Nothing will come from this elixir its not helpful it ain't here ta fuckin' fix ya...   . It numbs you its a crutch so you can't truly cope..and if you drink too much its like tying a rope.. And that noose will get tighter every time you take a sip.  . You're waging a battle with the devil's (trick)... I'm not trying to be preachy or a prideful dick  . But I'm so much better now that I don't touch that shit..Alcohol is glorified by people with greed..so they can sell it to kids like it's a bag of weed.  . ..Its a drug just the same but its effects are far worse    . Its an endless loop a bottomless pit trust me I've been through it.  . ..Twenty years a daily twenty beers now I can luckily say that I broke free of the hell. Hell I've been saved.  . ..Now I live my life with purpose and a sense of pride.  . I can stand up and be the man that I've strived...To be....or not to be....that truly is the question  . So Don't listen to the demons don't even pay attention!  . ..Life's not without trial or struggle or pain but by living it with alcohol you got nothing to gain.  . ..So I'm done with the poison that once tainted my soul  . No longer will I chug A fifth now I'm in control.  . ..You can be like me too and earn a sense of pride  ..Forgive yourself even if you failed last time you tried.     . ..Open a window and scream with unhinged rage  . That you're sick of being imprisoned in this booze cage!  . ..Remind yourself that there once was a time..when you didn't feel the need to drink that glass of wine..and guess what you were perfectly fine.....So Do it all again don't waste another dime... If I'm going to succumb to disease or germs...  . It's going to be on my mother fucking terms...And  when I do die at the ripe age of eighty  .After having the chance to Hold all my grandbabies.. I won't regret putting DOWN the bottle as the path I took.  . I won't be wishing I had one more drink that's not how I'm signing my book...I didn't say it was easy you know how many times I tried?!..Alcohol creates a WAR inside our minds. Its the source of oppression in our everyday lives...But Freedom is in the palm your hand. So Its time to take our stand let's be this best support group in all the land... and I think we need to give credit. where credit is due  . I'm the man I am today in part because of this subreddit yeah That's you (ha)..&amp;#x200B;..Imagine we're on an episode of Game of Thrones.  . All of us on the battlefield booze bottles broken like bones.   . Let's stand Stand together with pride as you read this on your phones. .. VICTORIOUS we will stand after ALL the turmoil  . wearing the Royal Crown Instead of puking Crown Royal.  . ..So don't just listen to me don't just listen to yourself..Let's stand united in our battle while we exclaim:..For the love of all that is holy I will NOT drink with you today!!!
