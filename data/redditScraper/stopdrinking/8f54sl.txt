Hey /r/stopdrinking...What's on my mind today is the way I bristled for a little while about the truism of your abstinence being a priority. I don't bristle as much to think about it now. ..Because of course it has to come first yes the downside to a relapse is horrific but to me this only seems to be the relief that comes from ceasing to beat a body part against a hard object...But more because not drinking the effort to do it the effort to sit with What I Am Feeling and Doing Right Now What Purpose Does This Serve and How Am I and the Other Humans Here Each Howling for Recognition brings question after question about whether I really enjoy like or believe in what I am doing and what is going on in my present situation. I could spend energy on getting drunk and lose time to it and be back in the exact same place (or probably a little worse). ..And that leads to conflict personal issues reprioritizing and shifting things around in ways that could simply have all been masked by drinking feeling obligated and trapped and losing time energy and mental presence to the haze of being drunk. Abstaining is answering a single question negatively "will I have a drink?" And the practice of answering "no" brings a ton of other questions I would never have expected and the answers to many of those questions are also "no."
