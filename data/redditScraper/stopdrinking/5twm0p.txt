Found this sub from a post on my front page stating "You can't have a hangover if you never sober up." And it really hit home. I have been dealing with alcohol abuse for a couple of years now and having been really struggling with it. I was 2 weeks sober then decided to have a six pack last night and feel like complete shit for not having the control to say no. So I'm back on day 1 and maybe this sub can provide me with some inspiration to go further as far as I can to better myself because I don't want to drink anymore. I hated the feeling of even drinking the beer so I don't even understand why I drank the whole six pack.
