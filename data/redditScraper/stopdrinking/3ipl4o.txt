I noticed a comment earlier this week where someone asked if anyone else had an eating disorder. A half dozen people immediately sprang to mind...We asked about [other "issues"](http://sd.bot.nu/survey/2014/other_conditions) on the survey but that was a while ago.  ..ADD/ADHD Agoraphobia Anorexia Asperger's Autism Bipolar Borderline Personality Disorder Bulemia Anxiety disorder OCD Depression PTSD Schizophrenia etc...I know many people here have struggled with other addictions--drug gambling sex etc...I know some people struggle with issues from growing up with an alcoholic parent (ACOA)...I know some people here are double triple or even quadruple winners.  (I don't know what those mean so if you don't know you'll have to ask /u/Slipacre.)..**Questions:**..1.  What *else* is wrong with you?..2.  Tell us a little about your struggles.  How did you/do you deal with them?..3.  If applicable do you consider yourself "in recovery" from those other issues?  For how long? How does that compare to your alcohol recovery?  ..The lists above aren't all inclusive of course and the questions are not intended to be limiting.  ..So tell us...what else is wrong with **you?**
----------immediate responses--------

1. Depression spatial memory disorder other cognitive functions decreased (I know I know) from years of epilepsy and brain surgery! Only have my hippocampus on the left side of my brain cause the one on the right atrophied!..2. Things are bad sometimes and sometimes real bad. Suicidal ideation rage at frustration due to my myriad memory and cognitive issues. But they have never ever been more manageable than in sobriety!  ..3. I'd say so. I've found ever increasing peace with my mental health. It gets better almost weekly.  My firm belief in entropy as power greater than myself gives me piece of mind (lol) about my brain. The damage is done. The energy spent. I can't get back what was lost I can only move forward.
I have recently been diagnosed with PTSD. I worked for a couple of years on and off in a place where I was often put in some pretty dangerous situations. It affected my regular work in my hometown as I was associating the two (both were nursing jobs). I escalated my drinking in part to try to deal with the trauma. I quit this other job just a few days ago after long discussions with my therapist. I've gone back to my regular job part time I'm seeing my therapist once a week I'm practicing yoga and meditation and I'm staying sober. I don't consider myself recovered just yet but I'm working hard and things are on the up!
I'm kind of an asshole with a bad shoulder and seasonal allergies... ..But seriously I'm very lucky to be in decent health and it's something I don't take for granted. 
Unfortunately all of my issues are of own making... drinking smoking and overweight. I noticed last week there were several mentions of gaming addictions and I could certainly relate though I managed to get a handle on that several years back. After I get a solid hold on sobriety I intend to tackle smoking then move on to my eating and exercise (lack of) habits. I consider myself very fortunate. 
Drugs to some extent but mainly depression and I think some kind of undiagnosed autism spectrum disorder.
FOR ME: people.  It starts with and then goes into orbit around people.  All the other things spring off of that...My core - a self esteem warped  twisted  cracked  armor plated thin skinned under inflated.  I was issued the Korean language version of the manual for a different species.  Even the illustrations made no sense.  This produced isolation fear and ANGER...Drinking drugs a desire to lose myself in relationships were the natural outcome.  To some degree workaholism to prove myself and an outlet for anger too. ..I am lucky I don't like the "high" I get from gambling.  Anger was a constant - towards the world - towards myself.  Socially inept (and born with a skill of being attracted to emotionally unavailable women) I did not get as far into sex addiction as I wanted to...2 though I wanted to blame my upbringing where there were isms - that was not a productive path.  For me AA where for the first time in my life I felt as though I belonged where I was accepted for who I was where people who were like me took the time to help slow the swirling clouds.  Agnostic as I am the tools of AA the slogans hokey as the are the steps the fellowship loving me until I could learn to love myself.  This was hard I was such an isolator - and had a failed marriage which took the first four years of recovery to dig myself out of...3. Think my recovery depends on healing this core identifying anger quickly and letting go - and service work - the prison stuff but sponsees and others (and here) - gives a purpose / provides a satisfaction a foundation for my self understanding/esteem.
I spent a LOT of my adolescence in and out of psych units. I was a depressed severely anorexic and a cutter. I was still those things (although I weighed about 85 lbs instead of 70 lbs) in my early twenties + alcoholism was a powder keg of insanity with psych units ER visits visits by police officers etc...These days I mostly deal with what some doctors consider bipolar disorder and others a mix of depression and anxiety. I *do* consider myself in recovery from both the anorexia and the cutting although I have an impulsively self-destructive streak that I am mindful of. But I am currently off my medications in hopes that of having a child &amp; doing well. No therapist or anything -- I tried briefly in early alcoholism recovery but I've had a LOT of therapy and wasn't getting much out of it...I struggle a lot with comparisons between the recovery process between anorexia/cutting and alcoholism. I could probably write a novel about it but I don't think anyone is interested so I'll leave it at that.
My crippling alcoholism combined with cyclothymia means I'm fun to be around at parties.
1. Type II diabetes; bipolar; slightly OCD; and an orthopedic miracle or mess depending on how you look at it; oh and I'm really struggling with putting on some unwanted pounds this year;..2. I work on fitness primarily by cycling everywhere I can; I take oral meds to control diabetes; and I need to correct some dietary issues.  I've long been off psych meds and I am no longer considered bipolar--although I'm still frequently a crabby asshole.  AA meetings and the 12 Steps are my go to path;..3.  I am in recovery from life on life's terms.
I am a smartass most sarcastic person with no patience that you would probably ever meet.
"I stopped drinking alcohol. I'm still the same asshole; I just have less dents in my car." - Robin Williams
I'm ACOA and going to my first ACOA meeting next week. It's about time! Other than a healthy dose of career inertia I'm a lucky lady and life is good to me. Therapy is my next "recovery" action for the inertia and dealing with the illnesses experienced by both parents at the moment. Other actiobs I take are exercise gardening cooking reading and meditation.
Not me specifically? But in addition to my alcoholism my daughter has borderline personality disorder and PTSD and my partner is currently in a 30-day inpatient for a drug addiction. and I'm a workaholic with two jobs for a total of 70 hours a week. Needless to say I don't get much sleep.
My things:..1. In recovery for my drinking problem (nearly 1 year sober with the support of cognitive behavioural therapy /r/stopdrinking and more recently SMART recovery)..2. In recovery from eating disorders (&gt;10 years ago treated with CBT and I had a crutch to fall back on)..3. Battling dermatillomania (compulsive skin picking I think it's regarded as a form of OCD)..4. In treatment for anxiety (with cognitive behavioural therapy)..5. I get verbal tics. Noone seems to have a clue what to do about that except to treat #4.
Hyperthyroidism anxiety depression I m may have MS still testing for that. Frozen shoulder which needs some injections. I gave up cigarettes a few years ago.  I gave up sugar for a while now that's about all I eat although I'm not very hungry. I smoke pot still working on that. I haven't had a drink in 11 months huh exactly. 
In the 1970s ADD was not yet a thing. I went untreated. Plug into the equation that I'm a middle child (read: attention whore ) a redhead and was chubby (read: food abuser) through high school so that puts bullying and more social insecurity into the mix. My first serious BF relationship was a model for codependency and I stepped into alcoholism when that ended. My dad is an alcoholic so ACOA was great when we still had a meeting in my area. Basically... with action effort prayer and meditation i stay focused on doing one day at a time. It's the only thing that has ever really worked. 
Nothing that isn't my fault I think. 
I suffer from depression anxiety bulimia some neurotic behaviors like hair pulling and skin picking compulsive self harm and some PTSD like symptoms. I've been in and out of therapy since I was 15. Alcohol definitely helps with a lot of the above but it ultimately makes my life worse because it makes everything harder to do. ..I am in recovery from a lot of the above although at the moment my eating disorder is really kicking my ass. I have a team of medical professionals- an MD psychiatrist a couple of therapists and group therapy people that I see multiple times a week. Most of that is for my eating disorder but of course a lot of it applies to substance abuse. ..I feel like alcohol has been easy to kick. It took me a long time to string this amount of time together but it's easy in that I can just stay away from it. All I have to do is not drink. I have to eat multiple times a day and that's quite a bit harder. The anxiety/depression are things that I have to deal with because I'm not drinking. I'm sad/anxious a lot and there's nothing I can really do about it but feel it...Honestly I'm struggling a lot. I'm not one of the people who can just put down the bottle and everything is great. Sometimes I wonder if fighting all of my mental issues is even worth it. Some days I just want to die because I'm just tired of it all. I just want to feel good and feeling good isn't something my body/brain chemistry is inclined to let me do. 
Self-esteem issues. I'm a confident person and generally don't struggle with being assertive. However as a child I was bullied constantly for years at school which I feel contributed drastically in shaping my personality...I'm not blaming childhood issues for my adult behaviour; plenty of people are bullied and don't later turn into horrible drunk assholes. But it certainly explains why I never invite myself along to anything and feel almost tearful with nerves at the thought of doing so. I spent a few years as the target of relentless bullying at school and grew up believing that I was an unbearable person to be around...I had a bit of a 'holy shit' moment just now as I sat down and thought about this. I've never really made the link between the bullying and the issues I have as an adult - fear that people would rather not invite me to social events/feeling more rejected than I believe is "normal" if my boyfriend doesn't make plans with me/etc. I also suffered a depressive episode a couple of years ago...It's minor in comparison to some other people's stories but it has impacted my adult life to a significant degree. I have used drugs recreationally as an adult but somewhat surprisingly this has never been a "problem" or got out of hand. Alcohol is the only substance I've ever really abused.
1. Bad procrastinator and obsess about video games a bit much..2. Currently on a 30 day break from DotA (an extreme obsession I had). Still play other games but I look out for when I start to prioritize games over other more meaningful activities..3. No. I don't want to give up video games as a whole though I would probably benefit from it. I just enjoy them and don't lose too much serenity now that I quit DotA.
1. Psychotic depression and chainsmoking. Apparently if depression gets bad enough you can lose touch with reality and experience delusions/hallucinations..2. I was dragged kicking and screaming to a doctor who immediately put me on an antipsychotic and an antidepressant. They have helped tremendously. As for smoking I've switched to a vape and am stepping down the nicotine very slowly over time..3. I haven't thought of using that terminology for it but I suppose you could say that. I tend to think of it as a medical condition I need to manage. My attempt to manage my mental illness predates my sobriety but it never really got under control until I got sober as alcohol messes with the action of my medication.
**1)** A lot and the whole reason I drank so heavily was to cope with it. Between 4-8 years old I was diagnosed with social anxiety disorder. At 9 I started suffering from OCD panic disorder and constant violent nightmares that would cause serious problems with insomnia for years. By 14 I had severe depression and spent the next 14 years *constantly* suicidal (and actually cannot remember the number of attempts). During my teens and early twenties I also went through a series of very serious chronic physical illnesses. At 21 I admitted myself to a mental hospital where I was misdiagnosed bipolar. At 25 I was diagnosed with severe ADHD (the doctor a specialist in adult ADHD was shocked that I'd never been diagnosed because it was *that* bad). It wasn't until I was 27 that I finally broke down and decided to give therapy one try and it saved my life...**2)** Because I grew up with these conditions I had no concept of who I was yet and so I had no ability to tell what was just me as a person and what was mental illness. My parents dismissed it as attention-seeking and rebelliousness (something which is unfortunately a very common reaction to children who are doing well otherwise) so I accepted that too. I believed that I was weak and deserved to be in pain; everyone told me that *everybody* deals with stress or fear or pain so I believed that I simply needed to suck it up and deal. There was no way for me to know that I really was trying to cope with something very different from the norm...When I got old enough to access alcohol it was a singular focus. It was the one and only thing that made all those horrible feelings go away. I could actually knock myself out. I could shut off. And I realized in a part of my mind I never shared with anyone there was a good chance I could kill myself in the process and spare my family the guilt of knowing it was suicide... I was 27 when I finally decided to go to therapy. I didn't think it would work because I didn't believe there was anything wrong with me that could or especially *should* be fixed. Part of me was hoping to convince the therapist that I was a horrible a person as I thought that I was right to hate myself with a white-hot passion that there really wasn't anything wrong with me that I didn't deserve. I remember being stunned into silence when she looked over my history at the first appointment and said "Wow you've had to deal with a *lot* of trauma." I'd so long accepted that I was exaggerating and whining that I had no way to respond to someone who genuinely didn't see it that way...**3)** It took about a year for me to "graduate" therapy having weekly appointments and using a variety of therapies including CBT and EMDR and eventually prescription medications for depression/anxiety and ADHD. My therapist and doctor both urged me to at least cut back on alcohol (and that's when I was reporting maybe a third of my actual intake) but I really didn't feel strong enough. Once the nightmares stopped and I didn't want to kill myself and I wasn't a ball of walking darkness it was actually really scary because I had no idea who I was without those things. That's how I'd defined myself. So I made attempts every couple months to moderate and I'd slide back down rinse and repeat. ..That was about 18 months ago. I'd heard somewhere that it can take that kind of time for the tools and ideas you develop through therapy to become internalized and I feel like that's what happened. I started realizing that the bad things I'd been drowning out for years weren't really there anymore and it didn't feel as good to shut everything off when I didn't feel that bad to begin with. ..For the first 10 days or so of not drinking my emotions were pretty difficult. The depression felt stronger which I know was my brain's way of urging me to drink. But then it suddenly shifted. And for the first time *in my entire life* I experienced being able to control my feelings. It used to be that depression and self-loathing were just my defaults like when there was nothing else to think that's what I went to without even thinking about it. Now it's almost like a little dog coming up to me and begging for attention like I can see it as something external and choose not to take it on...And for over a month now I have been off my antidepressants (with doctor supervision). There are no words to adequately describe what this is like. I never in my entire life thought that feeling this way was possible. I'm still fairly terrified of emotions and feeling things (and they only get stronger the longer I go without booze) but it's  amazing to me that I can have some say in what they are.
Depression/Anxiety..My mom's dad sexually abused me when I was 11. I never told anyone for the typical reasons - he was an authority figure so he it must have been ok; my parents wouldn't believe me; they would be mad at me for painting him in a bad light. Depression/anxiety set in extremely fast. Bottled it up inside til I was 17 told my mom about the depression (but not the abuse) when she noticed my self harm scars. She loved me and was caring and put me in therapy but no one ever knew the real cause. ...When I was 18 and away at college I got a phone call from my parents saying my grandfather had been arrested and I immediately knew he must have hurt one of my cousins. He'd hurt three. I screamed and cried about how I could have prevented it if I'd just spoken up when it happened to me and my mom got on a flight the next morning to come see me. The guilt hasn't stopped haunting me. They were so much younger than I was - 8 7 and 4. ..That weekend I got trashed for the first time and I got trashed nearly every day since. I drank to drown my own pain from the abuse I'd never healed from and to drown the guilt of not speaking up. ..The anxiety has gotten worse since I stopped drinking but thankfully the depression is already starting to lessen. I'm hopeful that I can move on while sober. I do consider myself in recovery for those issues but I am sad that it's taken me 11 years to begin. My alcohol recovery is making me capable of recovering from the other issues so they're hand in hand right now.
Great topic! It gave me a lot to think about in my own life and I really enjoyed reading everyone else's experiences and getting to know more about their particular challenges and struggles.I really related to a lot of what Slip said. At the root of everything are my issues with myself and with other people. Namely with feeling inferior to and terrified of others and with having a really warped self-esteem. At my core I think that I feel deeply unloveable and unworthy. Everything else is a symptom of that alcoholism included...I've also had a physician tell me that had we met when I was a child he would have likely diagnosed me with Asperger's. (And like Slip said thank god he didn't!) I just did not know how to interact with people. Every type of 'social skill' that I have has been very consciously and deliberately learned: I was so introverted and terrified of others that I was basically mute as a child. Also an Adult Child of 2 Alcoholics which impacted how I relate to others and myself deeply. Could never make them happy or take away their troubles which led me to believe that I was deeply flawed and unloveable. I've struggled with severe depression and anxiety since as far back as my memory goes. I was a suicidal six year old. ..Lots of different manifestations of these issues throughout the years. In elementary school I was obsessed with choking myself with belts till I passed out. Middle school through junior year of high school I was a compulsive cutter with some sporadic episodes continuing until sophomore year in college. Bulimic in high school anorexic in college. Deeply suicidal for years and years. I would never allow myself to kill myself even though that was my number one desire because it would have crushed the soul of my sister but I thought about it nearly every minute of the day. My sister is the only reason that I am still alive today and for that I am infinitely grateful. I've been a problem drinker for as long as I've been drinking and I never met a drug that I didn't try and didn't like. I've seen someone say it here before and it rang so true: my drug of choice was always MORE. I ultimately settled into an addiction to booze &amp; pot morning noon and night but in my college years spent some lengthy periods addicted to opiates and amphetamines as well. Last but not least I was diagnosed with PTSD related to my abusive mother and to two instances where a man that I was friends with for about 2 years prior sexually assaulted me in one of the only places where I felt safe on campus. That really messed with my head in ways that I am only beginning to delve into now. I spent the two years following those events nearly crippled by out of the blue panic attacks sometimes triggered by something as simple as having a man enter my 'space'. ..Recovery from those issues? Hmm. Like I said I think the fundamental issues are problems with myself. I believe that I'm only now giving myself a chance to work through all of the issues that led me here now that I am trying to free myself from drugs and alcohol. Then I believe that I'll get to the root causes. Everything else was an attempt to somehow externalize the internal pain that I was feeling in one way or another...I no longer harm myself because at a certain point I realized that I was sending exactly the wrong kind of a message to a self I was trying to learn how to love. I don't actively restrict or purge as far as eating goes but I do still catch myself being proud when I realize it's 6:00 pm and I haven't eaten yet for the day. I'm body dysmorphic in a serious way: I can close my eyes and feel bones protruding but when I look in the mirror all I see is fat fat fat. Currently working to kick the drug and alcohol habit. ..Oh and health issues? Celiac disease allergies to dairy/corn/eggs/peanuts/tree nuts/soy IBS arthritis (at 26 grr) and chronic migraines. No appetite whatsoever and some unresolved GI issues - chronic nausea vomiting diarrhea (still envious of those of you with your normal poops!)..Boy typing this up really made me realize I need to find a therapist and stat! But to end it on a positive note I've never felt so strongly that I am FINALLY where I need to be in order to work all of this out and happily move forward :-)
I've got depression. Turns out that thinking about suicide daily is just as abnormal as blacking out daily. Other issues too but that's the only one severe enough to require treatment. I haven't found a solution to being an asshole yet...I've been [open about my depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2jxkki/taking_the_first_step_again/) on SD. The [advice and support](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2l2euu/alcohol_as_antidepressant/) I received has been hugely helpful...I am in recovery. For me it's all part of recovery and improving my mental health. Like my alcohol addiction I think dealing with my depression will be a life-long project. I've used the same tools for depression as I did for alcohol--cognitive behavior therapy exercise mindfulness--with the addition of antidepressants. 
Most of my bad drinking habits were learned from my dad. I also have a history of alcoholism on both sides of my family but I still think the main challenge for me is behavior not biology...Other than drinking though I'm in pretty good health. I eat poorly and too much sometimes but I lift weights too so it's a push. I have a great marriage excellent career and I'm about to finish my second master's degree. Really I just have to find better outlets for stress than getting drunk alone.
I'm just generally kind of crazy take an ssri self loathing perfectionist self centered with low self esteem little ocd little body dysmorphic disorder. I can be manipulative stubborn feisty too proud extremely judgemental and the worst of it is directed inward. I used to lie a lot I have intentionally hurt people. Im also highly sensitive (hsp) loving and have too much empathy. I can feel others pain especially animals' in my soul...I have a little bit of like five disorders and a lot of a struggle with depression anxiety and ptsd/grief over losing my dad who was my best friend. 
My first thought was to answer celiac disease because I spent a few years very confused by the severe symptoms I experienced from beer. I'm actually really grateful for it because it stopped me from drinking for periods of time even if the reasons weren't the greatest...Seriously though I've been struggling with depression for the last year that's worse than any I've had before. I stopped drinking for the last time 6 months ago because I knew it was making the problem so much worse but now... I'm honestly scared that I'm still SO depressed after getting sober again. Six years ago quitting drinking launched me full manic speed out of my depression and I still have the job that I got and a lot of the friends that I've made. I would get down at times but through relapses and sobriety I always felt that I was depressed BECAUSE I drank and stopping has always coincided with my depression lifting...I didn't post a 6 month check in (and I was really looking forward to that!) because I spent the day crying in front of Netflix. I have weeks when I barely work 15 hours because I just can't stop crying enough to go in or find the energy to get out of bed. I should be at work right now but I slept until 2pm had a massive sobbing shitshow thing over how bad I am at life and now I'm watching BBC. I still feel exactly how I did a year ago when I had just been broken up with by someone I love very much; being genuinely brokenhearted set off this crippling depression but it's been over a year...I think I'm scared because I've tried so hard to make a life that doesn't cultivate depression. I gave up alcohol I changed out (most of) the junk food for fresh vegetable juice and other nutrient heavy stuff to help heal the damage I'm sharing a house with friends and our animals instead of isolating myself. I'm *trying*. I'm at the point where an antidepressant is the only other thing I can think of but I've only had bad experiences with them in the past and I don't have insurance. ..I know a lot of us struggle with depression and I feel for every single one of you. You're not alone in that rut and if you don't drink today hopefully the rut gets a little shallower. ..
1.  I am recovering from xanax addiction and alcohol addiction.  I also have dermatillomania (I just learned this word on this thread.) I am recovering from childhood trauma...2. It has been terrible. I have therapy group meetings supportive friends meditation and recently yoga.  I have to "reconnect" my brain and body because I dissociate badly.  All of the things I am doing have really helped me because I would have committed suicide if not for them but I am still feeling pretty badly even one year later. ..3. I think I am in recovery for the addiction and childhood trauma.  For a year. The two go hand in hand for me the addiction was to cope with underlying unprocessed trauma and to help me dissociate.  .
1) eating disorder and anxiety disorder (that's a newly diagnosed one)..2) well I used to deal with the anxiety and depression with alcohol but well.....I do yoga and try to exercise a lot. I just started taking celexa just 10mg a day and it will take a while to kick in I'm told. ..I guess I'm in recovery for them but I'm working the hardest on drinking for now
ADHD and I am very close to ASD (autism spectrum disorder) without ever testing more than close to it. Like every human though I am at my best when I am sober well rested get enough exercise and remember to eat like an adult. It's difficult because I often forget to eat and sleep since childhood...I'm what you would call and *on again off again Ritalin survivor.* Second thru seventh grade on Ritalin. Eighth through college I was on tea and coffee. Being able to function both on and off medication is why I had to start *operation teetolar* without medication. The next phase will be back on it. Not sure if it makes sense to most and that's OK. I am just glad my adopted parents (RIP) forced me to talk and interact with others...What works best for me? Meditation exercise music reading journaling writing and art. Medication helps for certain things.
I'm to sexy for my shirt.
1. I suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder and Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder. Also grew up in an emotionally abusive household but have happily been no contact with my family for a little over 3 years now (about twice as long as I've been sober)...2. BPD has been much more of a challenge than alcoholism (which in my case is arguably just a symptom of BPD itself). I've done therapy on and off for the last decade which has been helpful but a lot of what I've done has just been reading and researching as much as possible about the disease and how to manage it/recover. Supposedly the single best predictor for the prognosis of people with BPD is whether or not they engage in substance abuse. My struggle with BPD has definitely been a lot more manageable since I quit drinking...3. I do consider myself in recovery from BPD. When I quit drinking I met 8 of the 9 DSM-IV diagnostic criteria (personality disorder classification got funky in the DSM-V so I still go by the IV). At this point I would say I only meet 3 of them. I was in therapy as recently as last year but for the time being I am traveling and not seeing anyone consistently. I will probably go back at some point in the not-too-distant future though. Therapy is awesome (provided that you have a good therapist). As far as DSPD I was working 3rd shift for a while so that helped. The only other thing I do to manage the disorder is make sure I never build too too much of a sleep debt even if that means taking naps at weird times. I can manage not sleeping well for a few days in a row when I need to but it's important not to let things snowball. I guess I'll be put to the test again when I start my next job. Not drinking sure helps with my sleep schedule too!..Also I'm not super active on here but I do check reddit every day or so if anyone ever wants to PM me about any of this. I'm happy to chat about my experiences.
Anxiety and eating disorder related stuff. When I'm drinking I don't have thaT anxiety about what I'm eating and my weight. Guilt the next day? Oh yeah. ..I find whenever I'm not drinking I'm more controlling with how I look and with what I put in my body. Almost obsessive calorie counting. I wish I could be normal with both drinking and food. 
I'm medicated for anxiety...My drug of choice was always "more anything". I consider myself in recovery for everything but alcohol is the most dangerous for me. Where I am in my life I kind of grew out of smoking pot for example if that makes sense. Alcohol is the only drug that requires vigilance at this stage in my life probably because it's socially acceptable.
I am an adult child of an alcoholic (my dad passed away from it 8 years ago when I was 20). Now that I've gotten sober I need to work on quitting cigarettes and ohmigod the SUGAR. I have eaten cookies or cake for dinner three days this week... Other than that I am doing pretty well loving my new job and loving working the Steps! So grateful to be sober. I can't have anything without that.
1. Recovering cocaine and freebase cocaine (later known as Crack when some genius figured out how to make freebase without an expensive and highly flammable chemistry set) addict. I got up to 1/4 ounce per day (something I once considered impossible) and once stayed up for like 11 days in a row. I used to smoke cigs but gave that up at about 5 years sober. I also have this little issue with gas pedals--they all look like ugly bugs to me so I have this tendency to stomp on them. I'm also a workaholic but that suits me well in my profession and it's still "working" for me and I can stop anytime I want--lol. In early sobriety I was diagnosed with all kinds of psychiatric conditions but none of them stuck for long after enough sobriety and time spent working on myself via:..2. AA and therapy...3. I consider myself in recovery from everything except mistaking gas pedals for ugly bugs and workaholism (but even with that I've made great improvements). My clean date from all mind altering substances is exactly the same as my sobriety date...
I can't go into a henhouse and just have one :(
Pain ranging from slight to ungodly on a nearly daily basis. No healthcare. But that's fine I guess... I can't afford the prescriptions and would surely get hopelessly addicted if I could...I have incredible anxiety that can't be ignored. I worry about everything always. I'm paranoid every night that a burglar a methhead or a swat team will burst through my window and hurt my family and myself...I feel wary and distrusting of people and prefer to stay as far away from them as I can. Yet I'm always online trying desperately to replace the human contact I deliberately tried to avoid. But online people don't judge you so obviously. They don't know you enough to cut deep...And those are only the visible part of my iceberg of problems. I could go on and on for an hour but I'm already too depressed just thinking about these problems...Nearly every part of my life is total shit and alcohol is what got me there. So why am I craving it so bad that I fuckin dreamed about resetting my flair last night?.
I have bipolar generalized anxiety disorder and panic attacks. I deal with them through therapy self care and not drinking. In fact the best thing I could have done for these illnesses is stop drinking. They haven't gone away and sobriety but they haven't gotten worse. No more trips to the emergency room due to suicidal thoughts and behaviors. They are manageable with medication therapy and sobriety...I also have bulimia. This is a weird story but I have struggled with this since I was a young teenager. I am almost 40. I have been putting on weight lately and couldn't figure it out. I'm eating relatively healthy and not drinking. I realized the other day I haven't purged in a really long time. I didn't intend to stop. It was my go-to coping mechanism. And I haven't used it. The only thing I can think of is I am managing my emotions better through sobriety.
Too long of a list and not really eager to name them all.. .Sometimes I get discouraged as I don't think I will ever be 'normal' then I have to remind myself what someone once told me. ..Normal is a setting on your clothes dryer...Basically I just keep fighting the good fight and try to remember to not be so hard on myself.
Raised Catholic and other stuff. Nothing clinical though those were the good old days and so walking both ways uphill through the snow is all we did and no truck with your fancy modern diagnoses.
Generalised anxiety disorder w/ co-morbid depression...High blood pressure in my early 30s (not great)...

Heroin.  13 years clean which incidentally was around the time the drinking started.  I've been told by a therapist that I probably had manic depressive or bipolar disorder but it seems like everyone has a disorder of some sort these days so I feel pretty normal.
OCD/depression bipolar anxiety/panic attacks (especially with medical procedures).  Relationship struggles with someone who still drinks.  I'm the primary caregiver for someone whose health varies day by day. I struggle with manipulative/control issues and a poor me mentality.  ..*shrug*  ..I'm a sick person but I am trying to get better every day.  Sometimes I have more success than other days.  That is the way it goes. 
OCD. Generalized anxiety and of course Panic Disorder!..Treated myself with alcohol for a long time till all it did was make my problems much much worse. Things aren't perfect now but they're better than they were!
&gt;What else is wrong with you?..Diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Anxiety. Maybe some disordered eating. Periods of emotional disregulation. I sleep 12-16 hours a day and it never seems to be enough. My parents are both heavy drinkers with their own undiagnosed problems so I'd say I'm in the ACOA category...&gt;Tell us a little about your struggles. How did you/do you deal with them?..I struggle with self-acceptance abuse and validation. Right now I deal with them through techniques learned in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and I lean pretty hard on my IRL support group that includes my little sister and a few close friends. I used to deal by drinking to hide from my problems which include unbearable anxiety. Now that that "tool" is gone I use other ones. Self-soothing tracking meals tracking moods trying not to sleep through alarms trying to do basic self care. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it takes a week or more to bring myself to shower. That hasn't changed since I stopped drinking...&gt;If applicable do you consider yourself "in recovery" from those other issues? For how long? How does that compare to your alcohol recovery?..I went into crisis and nearly shot myself in maybe 2011 which is when I made a critical choice and decided to go to the E.R. instead. I was put on meds and into therapy. I was in and out of therapy until 2014 when my last therapist moved to a facility I can't afford. Now I'm in a bit of a low place but I've got this...I decided to stop drinking on Monday August 5 2015 when I had a serious conversation with my primary care provider and then my sister. I hadn't had a drink in maybe 48 hours at that time and then I realized I never could again. I feel a little resentful the same way I resented my family for wanting to keep me around when I was suffering but I know that will pass just from my experience with suicidal ideation...It's still early in the game but it's hard to do things for myself. I haven't driven a car in 2 years and it's very limiting in Los Angeles. I'm a grown-ass woman 24 and I haven't been to work in a week. There's beer in the refrigerator again because of my parents and it's very hard but ... again I've got this. Living with a bunch of problems I have little control over is nothing new. When there's a choice offered to me when I get an opportunity to say yes or no to living or dying or not drinking or drinking I've newly chosen the harder route and kept on trucking.
