 Sobriety is starting to feel like normal. But I also want to say that I don't want to be defined by my sobriety I just want to strive to be a better person all-around. I am an EXTREMELY emotionally stunted person of which alcohol abuse was one of my defining symptoms. This may sound like excessive negativity toward myself but it's an HONEST assessment. I'm trying to start to live my life by being defined by my honesty be it to myself or to others. Once we start getting an honest picture of what our shortcomings are we can start to chip away at them piece by piece. I've known a long time what I need to do to improve my life. Drinking made it a point to de-prioritize and put off all the things I can do to improve the things that I need to work on. ..As of right now I'm still working on trying not to obsess over things I have no control over. Last week at my low-bottom drunk I hit someone who I love dearly. And since then that person has completely cut me out of their life cold turkey as is their right to do in the interest of their own safety and emotional self-preservation. I am struggling with giving that person their space and not contacting them to try to talk about what happened and tell them that I would never consciously ever physically hurt them. But in me trying to contact them I am emotionally hurting them. This is a completely selfish way to go and I am absolutely struggling with it. I know I can't make it better but I want to fix it so badly that my emotional actions even while sober are still bordering the inappropriate. So I am very far to go in life. Impulse control and delaying gratification are two major areas that I need to work on. ..If anyone has any exercises or thoughts on how to start to rein in these impulses or put them on the shelf for the time-being PLEASE respond or send me a message. I'm also always looking for phone numbers and have been texting with a few sobernauts and sharing about our days and small struggles and victories...Be good.

Welcome. Thank you for sharing. Trying to rid ourselves of guilt and shane by making amends too early is not a good idea. Until we are sober awhile we don't have any credibility...In early sobriety our emotions are all over the place. I had trouble with impulsivity too. What helped me the most was having a counselor and going to AA meetings. Working the steps is an excellent way to address issues such as guilt and shame and when it's the right time to make amends. I learned coping skills received support and guidance made friends and had fun. Maybe you would too...You can try an imagery exercise: Imagine a box. Place the incidents or issues that feel overwhelming in the box. Put the cover on it and slide under the bed or put in a drawer. When it's the right time you can take out the box and open it. Your problems will still be there but you will hopefully be better able to cope. When you open the box it can be helpful to do this exercise with a counselor or sponsor.
