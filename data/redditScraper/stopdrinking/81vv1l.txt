I had a bit of a challenging week (relationship drama some entirely bad news re my job struggling with my mental health) and with it came strong cravings to drink. I started to fantasize about drinking briefly questioned my .reasons for quitting and wished I had wine or beer or anything really to make the trying nights feel easier...But today!..I worked out (and mentally contrasted my positive experience with some of the miserable hungover workouts I've had over the past few years);.I took care of my dog (cutest dog of life);.I went to a training for my volunteer group;.I had some wonderful conversations with good friends;..And I didn't fucking drink. And it's *Saturday.*..I know there will be good days and bad days but I just wanted to celebrate a day on which sober life feels like it might not be so bad. Thanks SD for your ongoing support not just for me but for everyone who seeks it here.
