A month ago I found this sub-reddit of SD desperate and  looking for a way to stop drinking . From 0 to 30 days sober for an alcoholic like me that's a big achievement. So today  I feel so happy  so thankful with all of you who have helped me  every day to stay sober. For almost 2 years I tried to control or stop drinking  failing all the time. With no place to go to resolve my problem since already in the past I had tried AA in the spanish version  I stayed sober several years but struggling with the spiritual part of the program and the pressure of my fellows to achieve a spiritual awakening. I'm atheist. So hard to find secular meetings and the inconveniences like my long working hours and the language but personally I feel safe more confident and with more freedom with all of you at SD. My problem is the alcoholism and some how this is working for me. .P.S. I'm a native spanish speaking so I'm sorry if I'm running short to express all my thoughts feelings and thankfulness to you.
