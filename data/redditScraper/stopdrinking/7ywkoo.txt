You picked your self up and started over. That's all you can do. You can do this!
Relapse is apart of treatment for some people. It's not about the drinking incident it's about how you recover from it. You can do it! 
           
We are still here with you :) Get back up and dust yourself off. One day at a time my friend :) IWNDWYT
You can do it. I'm in day 12 and no guilt or anxiety. It's so worth it.  
I like the phrase "Badge Reset" better than relapse.  I just reset my badge.  It's a process.  Try and be kind to yourself.  IWDWYT
You're good and you've got this. I too just recently relapsed after a stint of 121 days. It's all about the bounce back.
I just reset my badge too after 28 days. It sucks but guess what? We don't ever have to reset it again. Let's move on. IWNDWYT. 
It's only you that hates you. Get back on the wagon and carry on. We are still here for you
