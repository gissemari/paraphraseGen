I don't really ever post on here but I read posts every day. This is the 3rd or 4th time I've gotten to 30 days. I have always relapsed before 60. This time I'm determined to get there. ..My new favorite tool when I feel like drinking (or using) is to think about H.A.L.T: am I hungry angry lonely or tired? Whenever I'm tired I want to smoke pot. Whenever I'm isolated I want to drink. Anger leads me to benzos. ..I'm getting better at taking inventory throughout the day to see how I'm feeling and take care of myself. And of course checking in to read posts here often :) thank you guys for all the insight and advice I've gained on here!!

congrats! .and now you never have to do these first 30 again :)
Just keep those thoughts with you daily. I never let my guard down. Every day is just another step closer. Then just keep moving that bar. Before you know it you will get past that 60 and keep moving forward. As cheesy as it sounds. One hour.. one day... at a time. Those hours and days lead to months. Good Luck and hang it there. 
HALT is such a great tool. Really helps me be mindful of what's actually going on when I feel any cravings which to be honest are getting pretty rare these days. Great job on 1 month that star looks good on you! 
Congratulations on 30 days! You don't have to live like that anymore.
Just don't drink today.
