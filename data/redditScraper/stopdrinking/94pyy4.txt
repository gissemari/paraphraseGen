When I first stopped drinking my partner was really supportive and encouraging. He didn't keep alcohol in the house and if I said I wanted to drink the response would be "You don't need to do that" and he would not participate with me...Of course I relapsed several times...Now I have told my BF that I need and want to stop and he just changes the conversation. He keeps alcohol at the house and he will bring up the fact that he is going to drink and tell me to deal with it. If I say that I want to drink he just asks me what kind I am drinking...I can't really fault him because I know that I have been back and fourth with it but I need to stop and feeling like nobody gives a shit just makes it worse for me. I don't know how to fix that or get more support now.
