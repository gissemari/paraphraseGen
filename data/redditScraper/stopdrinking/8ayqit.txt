I posted a couple weeks ago that I had been sober for 6 months and relapsed. I had my assessment done and I start orientation today for an intensive outpatient program. I also start an all Women's AA group this evening. I needed to taper down at my moms to avoid the horrid withdrawal.  This was by far the worst withdrawal I've ever had. I've binged longer in the past but this relapse took me down hard. I'm looking forward to healing and getting back to who I know I can be. I can't wait for the clarity to be back. The treatment is 6 months long which I chose since I relapsed at my 6 month mark it scared me to think what could happen after letting my guard down. Anyways thanks for all of your kind words of support on my last post and I will not be drinking with you today.
