My mother has had alcohol problems for my entire life she is a nightly drinker at home. She has seriously injured herself a couple of times in my childhood once she was coming back from a party at 4am couldn't find keys so climbed through a small window pane that had a shard of glass sticking out of it which sliced her entire leg open. Luckily the neighbours heard the noise or she would have bled to death. She spent 4 weeks in hospital and it was confusing for us as young children...*Side note: i do have sympathy for her struggle and wish she would get help but she also has a personality disorder and has just been abusive to me my entire life (think spitting venom at your 13 year old child about how they are a whore type behaviour)*..Anyway I've been sober for 113 days now (whoop!) and even since the early days my mum has been less than supportive. She was asking me to get her a cold beer from the fridge while I was only days sober and we recently spent a week away on holiday (along with my husband) in which she kept saying stuff to me like  ooh I wonder if this restaurant tonight does nice cocktails?  Or  Oh god I can't WAIT for a cold beer!  I've just seen her for the first time in a while and she was telling me about her wine tasting that she's booked 2 tickets for...I bit my tongue a LOT but what I really wanted to say was this.......I see you jealous mother who probably wants me to stay as sick as you are and I raise you my lovely glass of cold cloudy lemonade. Cheers to breaking the cycle of addiction and not developing pancreatitis!

Good job!!!  Yes I can relate to the childhood confusions I faced when I was young.  :(  I don't talk to my father anymore.
Yikes sorry to hear that your Ma is.... less than supportive.....Have you ever come across the [Laundry List](https://adultchildren.org/literature/laundry-list/) from Adult Children of Alcoholics? It's a good read and might resonate with you in some way.....A noted trait of ACoAs is that they either go on to develop a drinking problem themselves or marry someone else who does so it's worth being aware of.....r/adultchildren r/JustNOMIL and r/alanon might also be useful sources of support and insight as someone being affected by a parent's drinking/general narcissism and craziness......Fizzy-Water-Cheers to your sobriety long may it continue!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Congrats on your sobriety! Yes...
You are wise beyond your years.  Your concerns and questions are totally appropriate.  My father is an alcoholic and is living with Alzheimer's.  It took me years to figure out the boundaries I needed to set up to protect myself.  He has always been a narcissist.  It took me until I was 50 to figure out how to protect myself.  Good luck to you and don't let you mum yank your chain.
