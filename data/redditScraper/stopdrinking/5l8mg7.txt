I did pretty much the same thing with the same amount of sober time under my belt. It sucks to reset and also to feel like we blew it but the important part is that we are here brushing ourselves off and starting again. That takes strength. Well done. I won't drink with you today x
You know as a relative new comer to this stuff I don't have great advice or a "been there" story but one thing I can tell you is you can only move forward. You slipped up you learned something about yourself you'll make the adjustment and move forward. That's all we can do just keep moving forward. I won't drink with you today
The alcoholic brain is the slyest if tricksters. I've caught on to mine more often these days. As we speak I'm struggling. My little voice has given up trying to be sneaky right now and is instead shouting at me demanding I drink to ruin not having a drink at all during 2016. It wants to see me crash and burn at the last possible second. Too bad for it that I now have an amazing support group and it's fighting all alone. I won't be losing this fight as much as that voice bitches at me. ..I like to think we learn from our relapses. That whatever trick our alcoholic brain puked will not work a second time. Eventually it'll run out of tricks...
Glad your back. I know the support here is amazing. I won't drink with you today.
