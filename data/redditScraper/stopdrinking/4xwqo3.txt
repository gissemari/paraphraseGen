Hello today marks my third day sober after relapsing following two months of sobriety. I have been drinking heavily since I was 16 and by the time I was 21 I was drinking one-half to one entire bottle of vodka a day. By the time I turned 22 (current age) I had managed to cut back to 4-5 shooters on a good day and 8-10 on a bad. Following my relapse my habit came back and it came back hard. Definitely had more bad days than good and was starting to feel the physical effects. But that wasn't what stopped me. The panic attacks I was having nearly everyday that I quelled with alcohol about my health didn't either...On the day that I stopped I drank about five shooters too quickly and passed out in bed. I awoke with this really overwhelming feeling that I wasn't supposed to wake up at all. I still have no clue what that feeling stemmed from but it's one I've never ever felt and definitely hope to never feel again. The horror of realizing that I could have easily died so young doing the same thing day in and day out without having given my life any sort of chance at all straightened me up pretty good. (Is that weird by the way? Has anyone ever had that happen?) Following a pretty heavy night finally realizing the path of destruction I'd set myself on for what it was and holding myself accountable the urge to drink just dissipated. I haven't experienced any noticeable withdrawal symptoms following my stopping except a staggering amount of irritation and I'm able to keep my money on me without worrying about buying any alcohol. Which is something I wasn't able to do for at least two weeks the first time I stopped drinking. ..I've decided to attend at least one AA meeting this week and allow myself to eat and sleep to my heart's content. I'm spending a larger amount of time alone and doing nothing but researching ways to better supplement my time and deal with the trauma that led me down this path...My question is do you feel that this confidence I have as far as stopping drinking is misplaced? Should I be more cautious? I'm avoiding my triggers and refuse to be around alcohol for at least this first week but feel pretty confident I wouldn't allow myself to give in even if I was. Did any of you experience a pretty easy road at the beginning of your sobriety? The last time I stopped drinking was much the same as this but an urge to be "normal" and give drinking a try led me right back in (which is something I hope to avoid by finally giving AA a chance). Also how did you treat your first week sober and what would you recommend?.

There are a lot of questions in there that I don't want to answer too specifically because I don't know you personally...I think confidence is a good thing provided you have something to back it up. If you are going to approach your sobriety the same way you did last time and hope it works that to me would indicate misplaced confidence. But if you've got a plan that you think is going to work for you and you're implementing lessons learned from past failures then I'd say that's the good kind of confidence. And this kind of confidence does not necessarily preclude being cautious. ..For instance I have a savings plan for retirement. I'm confident it will work because I keep to my budget I've run the numbers I've got a stable job and I'm motivated. That said! I'm still cautious because one of those factors could change and I'd need to adapt to make sure I'm still pointing at my goal. (Does that make sense?)..My first week was rough. I was anxious very irritable and I had a pretty decent bout of insomnia. I found that meditating was really helpful and so was jogging. I'm not a big fan of jogging but damn if it doesn't make cravings go away...Best of luck and keep us posted!
I think a lot of the time our mind and body will give us warning signals that something is wrong so I don't think your feeling is a coincidence. When I look back at the last year I realized all of the times my body has screamed at me to stop drinking.
