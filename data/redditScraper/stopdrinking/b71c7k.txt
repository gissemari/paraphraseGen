I still have not conquered an extreme sense of shame regarding my alcohol abuse. Because of this I find it difficult to communicate with people in my life about it. I have chosen one trusted friend as my secret sponsor and they have been tremendously useful in talking through the urges... But I do not feel the confidence to ask my friends and family to hide their alcohol from me. A family member works at a brewery and the house is stocked with 100's of bottles of beer at all times which makes pantry control very difficult. This is an aspect of their job and I do not think I will be able to change it. We do not have a relationship where I can safely communicate about my addiction either. It would be a fight and a nasty one...I do think I have the strength to make it. For those 5 days until I had the classic thought of "I'm doing so good that a beer couldn't hurt" I had maintained a stable perspective about why I was quitting. I have that perspective today too. I just had to tell people that I failed and intend to keep trying in some public capacity. If you have any advice please feel free to share.

Could you reach out to others beside your family? I am thinking about AA SMARTrecovery or the like. Going there can also help with feelings of being alone in your struggle. I am also thinking about professional helpers like a doctor or therapist. They have obligatory secrecy...I haven't told too many people in my circle about my problem just my husband and best friend for others I just abstain because it gives me a more stable health (I suffer from a chronic fatigue-style of disease). I don't know how they would react if I told them the truth and tbh I don't want to find out either. I have my own support system and that's sufficient for the moment. ..IWNDWYT..
