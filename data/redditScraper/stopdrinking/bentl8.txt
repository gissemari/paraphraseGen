So I ran into an old client just randomly and we got to talking. He had lost a lot of weight and was looking great. I almost didn't recognise him...After a bit of work banter I mentioned that he had lost a lot of weight. He said that he was into running now days. Turns out he had quit drinking two years ago after his grandson was born. It was the event that gave him the strength to quit and running has been his main stress outlet...He briefly talked about the years the he struggled with the up and downs of addiction. Heavy drinking and wasted days. Hurt family through lies and deception. Careening loss of control. AA meetings followed by week long binges. It all sounded really familiar even though the plot points were different to mine. There was an event that offered him up the strength and he took it...It was really heartening to have a random encounter that strengthened my focus. I know I wont always be able to feel as strong as I do now but I can use these stories to take it day at a time. He said to me he had had days that he didn't know if he could make it. He just always tried keep it in mind - he only had to not drink for the day in front of him. Just one day at a time...I was really happy for him. I'm only just coming up on 90 days soon. To have someone who I didn't even know as a drinker open up to me felt entirely serendipitous. I was going ok not having a hard time with it but being sober left me aware enough to hear his story and remain receptive. He opened up and there was a give and take of experience. It was quite affirming.. .Thanks guys. Thanks for all of your help in the various ways you do. Keep in contact with yourself and those who can strengthen you. Remain open if you can bare it even when you want to shut yourself in. You never know what is next. All thing pass if you let them...One day at a time.
