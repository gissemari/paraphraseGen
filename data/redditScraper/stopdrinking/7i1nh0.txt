Today's marks 30 days since I relapsed. I can honestly say I was at a real low a month ago but I feel fantastic today! I had some help from my good friend marijuana. I don't consider smoking weed a set back at all. If anything it helps me come home from work and relax. Instead of cracking a bottle I just light up a joint. Before anyone judges me I don't use marijuana as a substitute for alcohol. I use it for balance. I have been an avid pot smoker since I was 15 I am currently 25. Just an FYI it hasn't made me want to pick up any hard drugs either..

Cannabis is a thousand times better than alcohol. If it's working who am I to pass judgement. Congrat's on the 30...
Well done - thirty days is certainly an achievement. I will not drink with you today.
