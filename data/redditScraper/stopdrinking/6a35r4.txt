I've been drinking and smoking weed for the last nine years. I've known I had a problem with alcohol for about 8.5 years and have tried to stop on my own many times. The longest I went was 3 months and its was a huge struggle...For the last two or three year's I've drank 3-5 beers a night and smoked enough to put my to sleep about .5-1 gram a day. My mental and physical health as well as my relationships had been getting worse and worse. I was miserable knew I needed to change wanted to change but found myself in a drunken high stupor every night as self hatred increased and I wondered if I was ever going to be able to stop...Last week I finally had enough. I was gearing myself up to go to AA meetings and was mentally prepared to do so. At that time I ran across a book on amazon called Stop Drinking Now. I laughed when I read the reviews because they and the book itself seemed absurd. "How the hell could a book make me not desire getting drunk anymore?" I thought. The notion seemed ridiculous for a problem that had been seriously affecting my life for the better part of a decade. But I wanted to give it a try and bought it. I read it over two days...Since finishing the book I have not had a drink. I have not craved a drink. It still seems weird to type that I don't have cravings. None. But as of now they are gone. My mental attitude towards drinking has done a complete 180..I applied the same concepts the book took towards booze to pot with similar results. I've had one medium sized craving for weed but have abstained..I've long held the conception that quitting would be hard. Near impossible. Doable but very very hard. This book changed my mind and showed me how easy it could be...I am taking things one day at a time. Hour by hour. I'm trying not to get caught up in the trap where I think I am clean forever or that I can have just one drink. One day at a time..I feel so much better mentally and physically. This weekend I did yard work! I went outside! I was not stoned and drunk before noon! Last week I was able to drive to get food because I was hungry and not impaired! It feels so so so so so so so good to be sober. Life is enjoyable again. I don't dread getting up hung over. I don't have nausea spells in the middle of work where I have to put my head down for 5 minutes a few times a day. I don't have to put in eye drops every morning. I don't have to pretend and lie to anyone about why I can't go anywhere. I am FREE!.I wanted to share this because it is unlike any other time I have tried to quit my addictions. For one it was easy which still surprises me. And something feels different this time. Instead of fighting my cravings and battling my addictions I feel like I have changed my attitude towards the drugs I used to do...Today is day 7. I look forward to seeing how day 8 goes...I will not drink with you today.
