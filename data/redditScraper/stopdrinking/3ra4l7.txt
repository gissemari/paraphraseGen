I am a young person working among young people...I have experienced things which set me apart from my peers...One is a struggle against alcoholism...Another is a long battle against depression...There are others. There are scars...Today someone in passing remarked.."You're such an old soul."..I have heard it before...I am never quite sure how to take it...On the one hand it is compliment of sorts...On the other it drives home the point that I am *different.*..These days I am okay with being different...I am isolated though...An island...I see other islands on the horizon...I cannot reach them...Maybe I should build a boat.

&gt; "You're such an old soul."..When I was growing up--I'd hear that a lot.  My wife (who I've been with for over 30 years) says that even when I was young I wanted to be old.  Now I am old.  I heard Tom Waits say in an interview with NPR (public radio in the States) that he couldn't wait to be an old guy when he was younger because old guys always had the cool clothes and hats and could pull it off.  So all in all being a 61 year old geezer is not so bad.  My advice live each day well and by time you get to geezer status you will have earned it.  
I totally relate. For me AA was this hidden oasis secret society of other old souls like me who can relate. We alcoholics share a unique experience and bond normal people cannot comprehend. 
This reads like lyrics to a song. You're a good writer. .Imagine now how much shittier you'd feel if you were still drinking. 
People used to say that to me all the time. Even when I drank which I thought was odd. But it can mean that you're wise beyond your years. I used that and got sober at 23. At 35... I'm not an island. I never was. I became my own mainland and have created my own version of my happiness.
