I have finally come to terms with the fact that I have a problem with alcohol. It hasn't interfered poorly with my job or relationships but I have issues controlling how much I drink. I seem to be able to stop drinking for a couple of weeks at a time but I end up getting the craving to go out and binge drink again. It's very frustrating. This past Friday I decided to go out on a date with my partner and get a drink with my dinner thinking it sounded nice... But that one drink turned into 10 drinks. I had 10 drinks between 5pm and 1:30am. I really didn't want to drink that much... And honestly until I just now counted how many drinks I had I didn't even realize I drank that much. I totally lost count. I never really felt like I had a problem before because my life still seems to be in order but it is a serious struggle to moderate my drinking when I start drinking. And it's hard to not get cravings to go out and drink. It just feels so amazing in that moment. I think about how it feels like everything in my life is just going great.... And then I wake up with a hangover and guilt and I swear off alcohol once again just to fall back in the same pit at some point. So anyway after this past Friday I have decided to download a sobriety app to encourage me to keep going. I don't want to drink. I want to stop and I want to live my life with a clear head and focus on reaching my goals. I have also been thinking about possibly doing some sort of outpatient rehab program. If anyone could give me their thoughts on that that would be great! I'd like to hear rehab success stories.

Welcome. The sidebar of the r/alcoholism subreddit has links to all of the major recovery programs. They exist because they work. AA was really the only choice when I quit but I couldn't have quit without the fellowship I found in those meetings. ..It's not hard but it's not easy either. It takes some effort. I wish I would have quit when my drinking resembled yours. It would have saved me years and years of misery. Finally I lost more than I was willing to lose. ..Good luck. There's a daily check in here that helps develop a positive habit. IWNDWYT
