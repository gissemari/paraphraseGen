I hit my psychological rock bottom last night. We had some visitors last night around dinner time - my friend and her mother. The first thing out of the mother's mouth was "you got fatter and fatter". It didn't exactly shock me because she has said that before. Some folks just think they have a right to say whatever maybe it is a cultural thing. I know that the wine and my thyroid problem has added 10-15 pounds on me. So I just told her that I didn't have time to exercise...We visited for a bit and as they were leaving she commented again about how much fatter I am compared to a few months ago seemingly demanding an answer. So I just talked about my thyroid problem. After they left I was fuming about their inconsideration and crudeness. ..But it suddenly become crystal clear to me - I haven't been happy with my weight for a year and I was actually fuming at myself. The outward weight problem is just a manifestation of my drinking empty calories wine. But the inward problem is that I am disgusted at myself. I avoid all cameras I got mad when the kids want me in a photo with them (how pathetic is that of a mother). I avoid mirrors even when I am brushing teeth. I thought back at all the obstacles that I overcame in life without any daily alcohol. I am really disgusted with what I am doing to myself. I hated the person that I have become. I didn't care much about finances bills investment kids' homework when I drink in the evenings. Sometimes I forgot to brush their teeth. ..I am ready to become the strong clear-minded dare i say beautiful person that I once was. ..I had a good cry and took my last sip of wine and spit it out and poured out the rest of the bottle. Re-printed an hourly chart (checked off each hour that I didn't drink). Calculated all the empty calories that I would have saved. Sent a heart-felt thank you note to the moderators to reset my badge. ..**My mind is calm this time.** The internal dialog has stopped. I try not to think about "never having a drink again". I just think an hour at a time. I re-read the babysteps from /u/coolcrosby...I am still not ready to attend regular AA meetings but will drop in a few more and listen in more...I silently thank the mother and daughter for calling me fat that was my psychological bottom.

I will not drink with you today. 
I could have written this exact same thing.  I've got 8 days now. I still haven't looked at myself but I can tell when I look at my hands that it no longer looks like I'm wearing puffy winter gloves. I can tell the puffiness is going away and that is encouraging. You can do it!
