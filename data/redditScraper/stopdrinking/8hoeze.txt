My brain feels maybe 80%. And I had my first normal bathroom experience. I also smoked one or two cigarettes when I was blacked out drunk. I haven't smoked more than a few times in the last 7 years or so. I could still feel the difference in a bad way today when I was on a run. Wow it is not worth it.....All in all though I'm really grateful to have another chance. I need to remember how horrible I feel when I relapse the next time I am tempted...

A week in and I feel years younger.  I was even around other drinkers this weekend and I have to say I feel so alive an full of energy. ..Keep up the good work!
Yes keep that memory fresh.  The benefits of having some drinks do not and WILL NEVER outweigh the negatives.  Imagine how good your runs will be in 2 weeks and 3 and 2 months etc.  You're going to feel so good!  Good luck to you and stay strong!  I will NOT drink with you today!
