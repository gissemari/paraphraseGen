Day one of no weed or alcohol. A try anyway..Dear Redditors..I have struggled with substance abuse since I was 15 years old. I started drinking alcohol and smoking pot at that age. By age 24 I had been to rehab for alcohol then benzos then injecting heroin and cocaine. The last stint was in early January of last year. I continued using afterwards so I moved up to a rural area a few hours away from the city I'm from to live with extended family. IT worked and I have been clean from heroin and cocaine for 6 months. The cause snd some of the results of all my addictions has been my high sensitivity both physically and emotionally anxiety depression fear of abandonment from losing my father at a young age (which I carry into romantic relationships) and some kind of social awkwardness or inability to sustain deep friendships. This last part is perceived and I'm not exactly sure what this issue is but the result is a life long feeling of lonliness of being on the outside looking in even though I have had friends and boyfriends that have loved me. Upon moving here a woodsy place with lots of old people and not many young motivated people has exacerbated this feeling of lonliness. I also lost many friends in the course of my addiction and had to break up with my heroin-using boyfriend whom I still love and miss very much but am totally out of contact with (which is for the best). I have a creative streak and have wanted to be an artist and a fashion designer so am trying to focus my energy there but a lot of times I have this underlying feeling that I am wasting my time will never be a successful artist or designer and probably wouldnt be happy even if I did because everyone knows these days that success does not equal happiness. The one thing that I have not been able to quit no matter how hard I try is marijiuana. And when I do try I just end up drinking more and drinking makes me depressed without weed but I always feel the need for "something" I have tried cutting back and I can't. I tried getting activities into place to meet more people but then got in a wreck and lost my car and am too traumatized to get a new one so im stuck walking back and forth from work. I have been in therapy for 10 years and 7 therapists and have not found any to be helpful for this issue- they help me quit heroin for godsake why can't I learn from them for this? I have been in the leaves forum. I really dont like meetings because I find them to trigger my drug use. I am willing to try anything to quit smoking. When I don't have it the world seems bleak and dreary especially without friends my age to share true joy with. I try to quit and revolve my life around work and art but I just feel like I'm in the rat race with no real purpose. Weed makes me feel like the world is whole and satisfying and easy to appreciate. Without it I feel like cold and empty. I wish I could make it far enough for my dopamine receptors to recover but I can't. My family knows I have wanted to quit 100s of times and just cannot take me seriously anymore. I would just keep on smoking but I can't afford it and it makes me tired and confused a lot of the day. I would love to enjoy it in small doses but my body just takes over and I find myself smoking barely an hour after I wake up!!! I have to quit both alcohol and weed when I quit smoking. I will be moving to more of a city at the end of the year because I just dont see great career or social opportunity here. Any thoughts or advice on mental health lonliness staying happy when life circumstanced are not that great marijuana addiction or depression is greatly appreciated!..TLDR; I have mental health issues and am struggling to quit smoking pot despite having quit heroin and benzos. My life fell apart during heroin addiction and I am rebuilding it in a new place struggling with lonliness and depression. I want to quit smoking pot and have failed many many times. Please help!

Hi welcome  self medication is something we know a lot about.  I too would smoke in the morning if I had access...and it does not work.  no matter what the substance. ..perhaps see a doctor to determine if you require psychiatric meds - and a therapist to work some of the shit out...  As for the isolation and other social stuff AA worked well for me yeah I know....
I'm a lot like you. Just moved to a new state where I don't know anyone besides my boyfriend. We have acquaintances and people we play pool with in the game room but nothing solid. I have no car and no job. The lack of social interaction on top of quitting alcohol has caused my anxiety and depression to multiply. What I've been doing is taking baby steps. I'll walk my dog for 30 minutes and while i used to just stare at my phone or the sidewalk as I passed people I will force myself to make eye contact with at least ONE person and say  hey how are you?  One person will eventually become two and so on. It helps get me out of that comfortable and sturdy box I've built for myself. I've done this before and it made it so much easier for me to begin interacting with people on a more personal level without even thinking about it. Which also helped my depression a lot. Hope this helps some and I will not drink with you today!
