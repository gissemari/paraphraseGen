Hey everyone I just wanted to write about my experience. I had been sober for a year went to meetings 3-4 nights a week had a sponsor the whole nine. the very night i picked up my one year medallion as  i was in front of the whole group telling them how i did it I knew I was going to drink that night. That night lead to a jail cell which lead to a month long bout of repeated drunkeness hiding from AA and nearly another arrest. Also lead me to blow my budget for the entire month of july. ..Thankfully My arrest charges will get dropped i still have my job and my apartment. But I no longer have the desire to do AA anymore. the meetings I used to love so much now only make me want to drink. I know that alcoholism will kill me and that my drinking is very dangerous for me. I haven't had a drink in 3 days. Any advice/experience with relapse and a sudden lack of willingness to do AA would be appreciated. thanks

Aww geez. Sorry to hear about your misfortune. I wish I had advice or experience in this area but I don't.. just hit 6 months on my first (and hopefully last) go-around. I did want to leave a comment just to say that there are options outside of AA! Al anon ACA SMART... .....maybe you have no desire to go back right now because of guilt/embarrassment/let down? Or maybe you need a reminder of why you started this whole process in the first place. Good luck friend!
Ask yourself why you don't want to go back. Are you embarrassed? Don't feel like starting over? Think it didn't work? .Relapse is okay and happens to many if not most people on the path of recovery. In my experience AAers are just happy to see that someone comes back and don't care otherwise. You didn't lose your sober time just changed your sobriety date. They liked you because of you not how much time you had..Maybe AA isn't right for you though. If so then I would encourage you to try a different path. For me going it alone has never worked. Fellowship and encouragement from other alcoholics has always been of paramount importance for me. No matter what though don't drink today. IWDWYT
