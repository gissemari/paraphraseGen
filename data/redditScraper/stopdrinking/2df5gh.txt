[Fourth edition of Alcoholics Anonymous aka the Big Book](http://www.aa.org/images/items/b-1_bigbook.jpg)..*The Family Afterward Chapter 9*..After the historically interesting but wildly-dated and frankly erroneous detour of *To Wives* we turn next to one of my favorite chapters in the Big Book *The Family Afterward.*  I should add a caution this Chapter continues the error that "Dad" or the "Husband" is the alcoholic beginning with the quaint construction "Our Women folk...."  Yikes!..Still this Chapter has some profound ideas that bear making the historical allowance for sexist archaic-isms. Today's reading contains my favorite passage from the Big Book which was constant solace to me as I went through the major life alterations of my return to sobriety and legal consequences that sent me to federal prison.  .________________________________________..**The Family Afterward**..OUR WOMEN FOLK have suggested certain attitudes a wife may take with the husband who is recovering. Perhaps they created the impression that he is to be wrapped in cotton wool and placed on a pedestal. Successful readjustment means the opposite. All members of the family should meet upon the common ground of tolerance understanding and love. This involves a process of deflation. The alcoholic his wife his children his  in-laws  each one is likely to have fixed ideas about the family's attitude towards himself or herself. Each is interested in having his or her wishes respected. We find the more one member of the family demands that the others concede to him the more resentful they become. This makes for discord and unhappiness. .      .And why? Is it not because each wants to play the lead? Is not each trying to arrange the family show to his liking? Is he not unconsciously trying to see what he can take from the family life rather than give? .      .Cessation of drinking is but the first step away from a highly strained abnormal condition. A doctor said to us  Years of living with an alcoholic is almost sure to make any wife or child neurotic. The entire family is to some extent ill.  Let families realize as they start their journey that all will not be fair weather. Each in his turn may be footsore and may straggle...There will be alluring shortcuts and by-paths down which they may wander and lose their way. .      .Suppose we tell you some of the obstacles a family will meet; suppose we suggest how they may be avoided even converted to good use for others. The family of an alcoholic longs for the return of happiness and security. They remember when father was romantic thoughtful and successful. Today's life is measured against that of other years and when it falls short the family may be unhappy..      .Family confidence in dad is rising high. The good old days will soon be back they think. Sometimes they demand that dad bring them back instantly! God they believe almost owes this recompense on a long overdue account. But the head of the house has spent years in pulling down the structures of business romance friendship health these things are now ruined or damaged. It will take time to clear away the wreck. Though the old buildings will eventually be replaced by finer ones the new structures will take years to complete. .      .Father knows he is to blame; it may take him many seasons of hard work to be restored financially but he shouldn't be reproached. Perhaps he will never have much money again. But the wise family will admire him for what he is trying to be rather than for what he is trying to get. .      .Now and then the family will be plagued by spectres from the past for the drinking career of almost every alcoholic has been marked by escapades funny humiliating shameful or tragic. The first impulse will be to bury these skeletons in a dark closet and padlock the door. The family may be possessed by the idea that future happiness can be based only upon forgetfulness of the past. We think that such a view is self-centered and in direct conflict with the new way of living. ..Henry Ford once made a wise remark to the effect that experience is the thing of supreme value is life. That is true only if one is willing to turn the past to good account. We grow by our willingness to face and rectify errors and convert them into assets. The alcoholic's past thus becomes the principal asset of the family and frequently it is almost the only one! .      .This painful past may be of infinite value to other families still struggling with their problem. We think each family which has been relieved owes something to those who have not and when the occasion requires each member of it should be only too willing to bring former mistakes no matter how grievous out of their hiding places. Showing others who suffer how we were given help is the very thing which makes life seem so worth while to us now. Cling to the thought that in God's hands the dark past is the greatest possession you have the key to life and happiness for others. With it you can avert death and misery for them. .      .It is possible to dig up past misdeeds so they become a blight a veritable plague. For example we know of situations in which the alcoholic or his wife have had love affairs. In the first flush of spiritual experience they forgave each other and drew closer together. The miracle of reconciliation was at hand. Then under one provocation or another the aggrieved one would unearth the old affair and angrily cast its ashes about. A few of us have had these growing pains and they hurt a great deal. Husbands and wives have sometimes been obliged to separate for a time until new perspective new victory over hurt pride could be rewon. In most cases the alcoholic survived this ordeal without relapse but not always. So we think that unless some good and useful purpose is to be served past occurrences should not be discussed. .      .We families of Alcoholics Anonymous keep few skeletons in the closet. Everyone knows about the others' alcoholic troubles. This is a condition which in ordinary life would produce untold grief; there might be scandalous gossip laughter at the expense of other people and a tendency to take advantage of intimate information. Among us these are rare occurrences. We do talk about each other a great deal but we almost invariably temper such talk by a spirit of love and tolerance. ._________________________________________..Questions:..1. Does the large and charge newly sober "Father" remind you of anyone else from the Big Book?..2. Why should we not fear the "spectres" from the past?..3. What is the key to life and happiness for others?  How might this work?...[Prior posts introduction and disclaimer](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=Big+Book+Study+Group+Series&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)
----------immediate responses--------

The insistence that marriages survive - is not **my experience.**..As an active alcoholic with a side addiction of co-dependency I had married the wrong person and we were hanging on as stubbornly as I had maintained the fiction that I could handle drinking...For me a failed marriage and living lies as a consequence was not a foundation on which I could build a strong recovery.  I was 4 years sober when we separated - it was not easy but in the end it was the right thing to do...*This is my experience only it is not to be construed as advice or a model for any one else....* ..
