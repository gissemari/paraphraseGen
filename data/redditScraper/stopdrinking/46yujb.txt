This is the first relapse in our relationship. I have gotten nothing but a half dozen text messages from him about it - he's isolating. I'm heartbroken. I was feeling shaky so I went to an AA meeting. I don't know why he did this I know it's not my fault if only I'd said yes when he asked me to go over last night I just wanted a night in it's NOT my fault but oh I am so so so... sigh. Something. ..Won't drink today though. I'm strong enough for this. Nothing else though today I hope. This is enough for today.

My heart was breaking watching my ex go in and out of recovery. I remember seeing his car at a motel around the corner from my apartment and just wanting to run in and save him...Thanks for sharing. This must be really difficult. ..When I talked to him about his relapses I just let him talk. I listened. I didn't push. I don't know if it was the right thing to do...but I couldn't be responsible for his sobriety.
Nothing you would have done would have stopped it--take it from a chronic relapser.  Either I am willing to go to any length or I'm not; if not nothing will stop its whispers in my ear..Wishing you the best
Do you think it is part of us wanting to drink again that feels left out and feels cheated out of a good time when someone around us relapses? Sometimes when I read relapses I go through a mix of shit.
I'm sorry. Can this be a learning moment for both of you?
That sounds hard.  It's definitely not your fault. You can't say yes every night and so it was bound to happen eventually. He's probably got a lot to think about right now. Hopefully he comes around and makes a real choice not to drink. But I agree with everyone that you have to give him space and it sounds like you already know that. I just hope he makes the positive choice.
