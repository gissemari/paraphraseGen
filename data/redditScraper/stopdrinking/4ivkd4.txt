If anyone feels like talking about it could you describe what exactly happens when you have say over 5 or 6 months of sobriety and then relapse? .What thought processes can you remember? Did you just think "Well I'm in the clear now I'll be fine" kind of thing? Or was it exactly the same as relapsing early on in sobriety (being depressed trying to moderate again etc)?..Thanks. .

Yes its a slippery slope. Brain rationalizes that "Oh come on just one drink is OK you are in control." Tricky the brain is. Then there are stress situations or an emotional situation or social pressure you rationalize away.
I went 7 months and then relapsed.  In retrospect it started with my deciding that I would allow myself to reconsider drinking after two years of sobriety.  I started thinking about that more and more.  Before long I was romanticizing it.  I was thinking about how wonderful life would be after getting in better shape being more productive etc. and then celebrating it all with alcohol.  Allowing those thoughts to develop was a huge mistake.  Within a couple months I decided it'd been long enough and went back.  This time I'm refusing to think about whether I'll drink again some day in the future.  I just won't entertain the thought.  The one-day-at-a-time thing for me is totally crucial.  
I was 15 years sober.  I had stopped going to recovery meetings a couple of years before convinced that I knew how to stay sober.  I began rationalizing various scenarios about choice freedom what normal people do watching foodTV and preparing meals with fancy wines smelling the bouquet of my wife's wines and finally going into a bar and drinking two beers.  See I can drink just 2 beers!  That lasted for 2 weeks and then I descended into a dark hellish place.
