[Guess what day it is!?!?](http://memecrunch.com/meme/V83V/professor-complemented-my-humpday-camel-impression/image.png) ..Good morning fellow sobernauts! Hump days are where we calibrate our sobriety check in see how our /sd buds are doing and support each other in our sobriety...Here in WuW we all share our struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations in the format below. Let's talk about it!..**Triumph**: There were a few times this past week when my brain decided to think "Hey I could just pop into that liquor store right there and grab something and check out for a few hours." I haven't really had those thoughts much lately so it's a triumph that I didn't even really consider them and before I even started playing the tape forward it skipped right to the end which was full of shame and regret and probably lots more trips to the liquor store. It might seem like a small triumph to say "I didn't drink this week" when I've got 226 days but I feel like it's an important triumph and I'm gonna take it! ..**Struggle**: My brain is giving me all kinds of struggles this week. I "realized" that one way I could "get out of" difficult situations in my life is to just fall spectacularly off the wagon. If I did so it's like I would be abdicated of all responsibility and the fallout of the relapse would be so encompassing I couldn't possibly be expected to keep up with these increased expectations in my work family and personal life. It's important to say that I'm not really thinking about doing this and I am not going to relapse over this but it's just weird that my brain is like "Well however stressful life gets remember there's always this "out" you can take by torpedoing everything that's going so well for you right now and just holing up on the couch with a bottle." I guess this may be a hint that I need to take a step back from some things or find other ways to give myself a break. I'll work on that this week. ..**General Chat**: I really like learning that celebrities that I admire are sober. Has anyone seen the [Colin Farrell interview on Ellen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5l1Z0ocnNs)? It's a good one. Who are some of your favorite sober celebrities?..So how are you guys doing? How has this week been for you?

HERMP DRR..nothing but triumph.
What's up!..**Triumph:** It's grad school acceptance season and yesterday I got accepted somewhere AND got a full scholarship. So that has me pretty jazzed! The whole application process was sober so I'd like to think not drinking had a role to play in this. :)..**Struggle:** I feel like I have no time for anything. I've had to split my work days between two offices in the same city but very far from each other. And everything has to be set up for some workshops I'm planning before I go on vacation this Friday. AND I am writing essays as part of the application to the Foreign Service. Luckily all this running around means there's no time for me to drink -- even if I wanted to...**General Chat:** Anyone have advice on how to stick to a workout routine? I do the same thing every time -- start off two or three weeks of solid progress then I travel and everything falls apart. There has to be a solution...Happy Wednesday everyone!
Triumph: I'm suddenly grateful for my recovery after a few months of ego pandering. A surprise side effect is the simultaneous return of my sense of humor and stop taking myself so damn seriously. ..Struggle: exterminators in the apartment striking deals with professional launderers. Everything but everything needs boiling. I've evacuated to family house with cat in tow. ...General chat: it's my birthday. ..Thanks for the interview - my favorite sober celebrity?..Rollins. Hands down. .
**Triumph:** I feel great. My brain is in less of a haze each day and I went to the grocery store for the first time since I stopped and didn't even think about going down the booze aisle. Didnt realize until i was leaving. I also got back into workouts after a week off....**Struggle:** Sculpting is one of my favorite hobbies. I love it and the things I create make my family giddy. But I ALWAYS drank while sculpting. I have an unfinished piece just staring at me from my desk and I need to get back to it without a bottle. Maybe I'll try some tea instead ..**General chat:** I like some of the things Daniel Radcliffe had to say about drinking and sobriety. But if I Google it it's all just 1 intereview about sex! Pfffff.

**triumph** 30 days!..**struggle** I got nuthin'...**general chat** Update on our fat cat: He continues to meow when he wants to draw our attention but I've realized that he meows at the location he wants us to come to not the location closest to us (i.e. Outside our bedroom door) so I'm grateful with that. Cattie does not accept life on life's terms but I will leave him to do his own cat inventory...Sober celebrities: I like the things Russel Brand has said about sobriety and I like a lot of the things he says in general. 
w00000000000000t Hump Day plus it is going to be 70 degrees here today hoorayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!..**triumph:**  I got 6 months.  Fucking craziness.  I can't believe it...**struggle:** I am feeling kind of crabby complacent and bitchy.  I'm judging and isolating a bit.  I cancelled lunch with an acquaintance today bc I just don't fucking feel like it and I have been having to force myself to go to meetings and smile at my significant other.  I don't know why I am feeling like this especially with 6 months of sobriety and spring right around the corner but I do and it is annoying to have to work at shaking it off all the time.  Dammit...**general chat:** RE: sober celebs I love Rob Lowe so much.  And Anthony Hopkins.  Edie Falco Chris Hardwick.  
Triumph: Hmm. Not feeling very triumphant. I've been hanging in and I've re-acquired a slightly improved work ethic again. These seem like little things but they are still things. Not every day can be a sprint towards greatness. ..Struggle: I'm having trouble wiping a particular slate clean without putting old marks back on it. Not quite sure how to quit doing that even sober. ..General Chat: Should have a new grandbaby today or tomorrow if things go as expected. I'm pretty sure this will be the highlight of the ~~week~~ ~~month~~ year :)
I love what's up Wednesday!..**Triumph** I've been off of work mid-week and haven't been tempted to drink so that's been great.  I just ordered some new running shoes (well actually a second pair of the ones I already use indoors at the gym) so I am looking forward to jogging around the lakes near me as the weather gets even nicer.  When I moved here last summer I was too overworked/stressed/probably drunk to do it so I am going to take advantage of it this year.  ..**Struggle** Still feeling a little overwhelmed at work but trying to breathe and stay positive.  I also haven't heard back from any of the other jobs I've applied to in order to get more "regular" hours and hopefully more sanity.  I've also gained a little weight which is odd when I've cut out my drinking calories - but I honestly think I was living in a near-constant state of dehydration so that likely contributed to the number on the scale...**General Chat** I love learning about sober celebrities as well.  I'm a huge Lana Del Rey fan and have always been interested in her sobriety - she got sober at fairly young age after some hard partying years.  One of her quotes also resonates with me ....."When I write about the thing that I've lost I feel like I'm writing about alcohol because that was the first love of my life..." -Lana Del Rey ...It was my first love too.  And what a cruel fickle one it was.  
**Triumph**: I've been dealing with a lot of stress lately: being busy at work having some rough-ish waters at home some injuries not sleeping well.  And through it all I have maintained my sobriety.  I feel good about it.  I don't want to drink and I don't have thoughts about needing escape which I used to.  Or even that I "deserve this" for one reason or another...**Struggle**: Like /u/cake_or_radish I have had some thoughts like "I could go up and just grab a drink" or while picking up dinner the other night "I could have a beer while I wait for them to finish making it".  While these thoughts aren't serious to the point that I actually consider doing it it's weird to have thoughts like this because I haven't really had any like that in a year and a half or so.  But again like /u/cake_or_radish I play the tape forward and see that I don't want alcohol to take away this new life I have that I enjoy so much...**General Chat**: I really like Eminem.  He talks about his sobriety in his music.  In fact on *Recovery* he apologizes for his previous two albums stating that with *Encore* he was high and with *Relapse* he was just getting sober.  To be honest I didn't think *Recovery* was all that great either.  Now *The Marshall Mathers LP 2* on the other hand is fucking awesome.  I can't stop listening to it.
**Triumph:** I paid off my license reinstatement fees!!! I can start driving as soon as it turns the 17th and I have an SR 22 filed at the DMV yay me!!! ..**Struggle:** School. I bit off more than I can chew and now I'm literally doing homework every off-second I have a chance. I do homework at home at work at meetings before I go to bed right when I get up and I never have enough time to "get into the groove". I reddit on mobile when I have a chance usually in classes which doesn't help heehee. If I fail this semester I'm going to be devastated. I don't think I will but it's always a threat. I found myself thinking this morning about how if I got into a car crash I would be able to have time to get all my homework done from a hospital bed. If I slit my wrists would they give me a medical withdrawal? I'm starting to get a little scared by these thoughts and I'm not quite sure they're normal. I have to focus on the positive. ..**General Chat:** My favorite sober celebrities?? There are sober celebrities?!?!?! haha jk I knew that. But I really like the fact that Macklemore is sober. 
**Triumph:** My **wife** had a drinking dream dreaming I was puking drunk late at night. Her first dream-thought was "he's going to be so bummed he lost all that time..." Counterfactual win!..**Struggle:** My sobriety feels solid. Time to step up the vigilance and work...**Chat:** I'm not much for celebrities but I like browsing the [list of teetotalers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_teetotalers) at Wikipedia.
**Triumph:** Went out this past weekend to a bar to see some friends play in a band. Wasn't tempted to drink and even found myself annoyed by the drunks I used to embrace in those settings...**Struggle:**   Patience. Never had much trying to work on that...**General Chat:** In the market to buy a new car thinking of a Kia Optima. Anyone have any advice on them?
**Triumph:** Life is pretty simple and I'm not experiencing a lot of urges to drink. Like hardly any at all. Still employed still living "well".    .**Struggle:** Life is pretty simple and I'm pretty fucking stagnant. I definitely don't want to chase reckless excitement but I need a good change still. Periodically still battling "single-ism" and "loneliness".  Dry drunk?  .**General Chat:** Wondering if I should go turkey hunting or striper fishing this spring.  .edit: fising to fishing
**Triumph:**  I've moved into a place mentally where I am no longer bitter with those that can drink normally and I feel no need to lecture them.  This tells me I have drifted into the stage of acceptance and maybe beyond.  I am embracing my choice...**Struggle:**  I found myself being less understanding of our new members these past few weeks (in my head only) I just felt like I was on a never-ending carousel of answering the same questions again and again.  But you know what I'm happy and honored to be allowed to help I just need to step away sometimes...**General Chat:**  I'm pregnant.  I just found out.  ..I am over the moon we've been trying for nearly 2 years and I had a breakdown over it last month.  I am terrified because of my miscarriages but so damn glad to not be thinking about alcohol or worrying how it will influence my parenting...  
**Triumph:** Today was/is absolutely beautiful weather- and life-wise. Boston is finally showing some glimpses of spring. I have seen GRASS for the first time in a looooong time. My job is (as) wonderful (as a job can be). My student tells me she loves me every day. My family is (relatively) calmed down. I have friends and an AA community to feel like I belong. Gunna go do some roller skating tonight :D I'm also soooo close to being done with my fourth step. I've moved on from a guy who wasn't that into me. Dating is weird. I'll just return to my regular ol' sober single life. Or maybe I'll just look at that in the sex inventory I'm about to start. ..**Struggle**: I'm tired because my life is big and full and I want it all so I stay up late haha. Guess I can't complain :D..**General chat:** Craig Ferguson is my homeboy. I remember Bradley Cooper saying something about it coming down to either dying or getting sober that I wasn't ready to hear at the time but maybe I'll re-read now..
**Triumph**-- I've got to list two:  1)  getting through a rough spot with my ex-husband his new wife and my children over the weekend **without** being crushed by a craving to drink and 2) successfully nursing an injured leg back to running health and getting my longest-run-to-date in (16 miles)..**Struggle**-- Loneliness/fatigue.  No matter how you cut it being the only hands-on-deck for two elementary-school-aged kiddos as lovely as they are takes a lot of energy..**General Chat**-- I'll give a nod to sober celeb Robert Downey Jr. he mentions yoga as part of what's in his sobriety tool box.
**Triumph:**  My discrimination lawsuit is inching forward incrementally which is easier for me to survive because I found a new stopgap job which pays twice as much as the former stopgap job!..**Struggle:**  In my training class (paid!) for the new stopgap job there's a woman sitting next to me who seems to be intoxicated all the time and makes inappropriate comments and outbursts in class.  I'm pretty sure she's going through some kind of rehab program through Workforce and the intoxication is from some kind of psych meds she's taking.  The instructor is tolerant but getting less so...It's a particular struggle for me because I've made so much progress on my personal boundaries in the past year or so.  Formerly people who were ultra-needy or non-functional used to target me to become their personal crutch and I used to let them.  I'm working on the right balance of being polite and occasionally helpful without slipping back into my former role (learned in childhood) of feeling responsible for everything or everyone.  And also not taking it personally - she would be just as disruptive if I weren't the person sitting next to her...**General Chat:**  Motorcycle weather is nearly here!
Triumph: Feeling good about being sober. This week I think I turned a corner with regards to resolve and that feels good...Struggle: Asking for help and getting it IRL. Asking for help and NOT getting it.  Suffering through problems because I'm not good at accepting support.  Working on it though.  Trying to not feel "alone" remembering/trusting that there is support &amp; trying to remember to ask for it IRL.  ..General chat: Favorite sober celebrities hmmm... Henry Rollins Johnny Marr of the Smiths. I like Nikki Sixx sober (not a huge Motley Crue fan but I know he helps Covenant House in LA &amp; I support that).  
Triumph: I finally decided to sober up really recently because I could see what my heavy drinking was doing to my body..Struggle: I might sound petty to some people but my boyfriend still drinks around me. I asked him if maybe he could cool it for like a week but he refused. He's not an alcoholic like me but it feels like dangling a mouse in front of a cat. I can feel the pull of that beer in the fridge calling for me..General Chat: I'm new to reddit and would love some support. Everyone seems cool here =) sorry for bad formatting if there is any:/
Triumph- well compare to how I was this time last year...everything is a triumph. I spent six months in Guatemala this winter same as last winter only this time I didn't drink. I was nervous about coming back hereand whether I would be tempted to drink...Nope! Getting ready to go back to the States shortly. Feeling sound and ready i my sobriety. So glad to be so do e who just doesn't drink. That's who I am...Struggle- worries about the future. My husband to be and I basically need to pick a country- he's an illegal immigrant in the US and it doesn't look likely that he'll get his papers any time soon as a result of entering illegally. I have a great job and life in his country- why not just settle here? The struggle is I am thinking about this alllll he time and sometimes miss the present moment. Anyway working I. Relying on my higher power to see me through this all. ..General Chat- just in transition time between my life in guatemala and my life in the states. Sobriety is friggig amazing- it helps me recognize and sit with my feelings and handle the big shift coming up. Rather then stress and drink...
Triumph: I am sober. I have an appointment with a psychologist next week and have told my outpatient counselor and that has taken a load off of my mind. Sadly I have to go back to high intensity outpatient for a while but at least I'm being honest and getting myself some more help....Struggle: Anxiety. I am thankfully not experiencing the panic attacks like I was the past few days but I am still wired and feeling scared. Anyone have experience or suggestions?..General chat: I love Rob Lowe and even though he's a grump Mark Maron.
