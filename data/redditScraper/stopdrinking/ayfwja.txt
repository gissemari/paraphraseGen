It will be 3 months on St. Patrick's day and I've been dragging ass feeling depressed manic exposed vulnerable bored restless down and out. And today finally after 80 days I feel GOOD. I feel like myself! Last time I quit it took a month. This time it took 3. Last time i dropped weight immediately without changing anything. This time I'm staying about the same. Last time I didn't do AA and I relapsed after about 7 months. This time I'm doing AA occasionally reaching out for help and it feels completely different. I guess what I'm saying is don't EXPECT anything. Don't expect it to be just like last time you quit. Don't get frustrated when you're not seeing results immediately. DO eat regular meals exercise and make time for your friends and any family you enjoy that you've been neglecting through your narcissistic erratic behavior. I am enjoying tea puzzles podcasts NEW workouts light yoga going to the movies (used to always be too drunk) NEVER being hungover at work or family functions remembering every detail of my weekend. I finally do things that truly bring me joy and make me happy. I used to escape and find happiness in being drunk af. I used to think having fun was meeting friends at bars and breweries but now I know that was all well and good but it didn't work for me. I always wanted to keep going. I always wanted more. I was irresponsible and irrational. Now I can be accountable trusted and am finally no longer a liability. I feel safe. I almost threw in the towel bc F*CK it last time I was down 10 pounds by now but our bodies adjust and change and the only thing that will make a difference is TIME. Time and patience and being gentle with myself and forcing my ass to go to a meeting here and there. Be nice to yourself today! Maybe by getting your heart rate up for 30 minutes or taking a long shower and lotioning up afterwards. We are our own worst enemy but can also be our own best friend. The latter is way easier happier and freer. I hope we all find freedom through sobriety. Iwndwyt

I totally agree about every time being different. In previous attempts I felt like I was hanging on by a thread but this time I feel confident and rather comfortable with it. I feel every time I quit for a time makes me better at quitting. That's how I quit smoking too. Anyway thanks for sharing and I won't drink with you today. Good luck!!!
Thanks for sharing. I feel the same. Last time was 3 months and felt way better. I am now starting to feel much better now at 4 months. Commitment to exercise and diet over the last few weeks have helped me dramatically.
