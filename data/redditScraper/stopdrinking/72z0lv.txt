Keep going it gets easier 
Great job!!!
Hello &amp; congratulations on your 75 days :-)..Did anything particular happen? Remind yourself why you decided to stop. Each day it gets a little better.  I know it is not easy but you are doing it. I will not drink with you today. .
It does get easier and there may be ways of making it easier - including posting here...Have you considered therapy counseling meetings?
Congratulaions!
