Reading an article in the New York Times on obesity in America. This paragraph is worth noting: "To be sure many of those with serious weight problems have probably tried and failed to lose weight and keep it off leading them to think there's little hope that yet another effort will bring success. But it is worth noting that for most people who managed to quit smoking *it typically took anywhere from eight to 30 attempts.*"..Clearly trying to quit anything is really hard and often requires multiple attempts relapses and resets before it sticks. As long as we keep trying. IWNDWYT.

Wow!  Really powerful to know that it's worth it to keep making the effort that one of these times *will be the one*.  ..Thank you Elle!
Without my past relapses there's no guarantee that I'd be sober today. I needed to keep trying every way possible to moderate until something finally clicked and I had enough. Not everyone has to bottom out but I personally did and I wouldn't trade it for anything. 
The only way to fail is to quit trying! ..I've definitely had my share of relapses and every single one has made me stronger in my conviction to stop drinking alcohol. I can even now say I have more sober days than drunk days since I started. I could not have said that a year ago. ..No one said it was going to be easy just that it'll be worth it. 
Oh man thank you!!! Brilliant info. 
Me too if we were counting that way!
