Hey SD..I've just climbed in bed sober (yusss) and am thrilled with my current favourite aspect of sobriety: my cat sleeps next to me when I haven't been drinking. For some unfathomable reason she doesn't seem very interested when I'm a writhing snoring ball of fitful drunken slumber but every single night that I'm sober she's around...Has anyone else here experienced changes with pets or other animals in sobriety or relapse?

Yay! My kitty is next to me RIGHT NOW! I have a journal I kept during one of my first sobriety attempts and I talk about my cat a lot - saying things like "wow my cat is really pretty and I never noticed!" and cheesy things like that. ..I know I certainly spend more time with him now that I'm sober so it's a win win for both of us. Meow!
My cat has always been very close by my side regardless but being sober every day has made me sad that I took her for granted when I was wasted all the time. Animals are such a precious gift...One thing that is noticeable is less scratches from her getting pissed off when I come home drunk and grab her and screech about how cute she is... yeah she never did enjoy that(!)
My cat and I really became best buddies during my first week sober. Still are.
In November we got brother and sister [rescue kittens](http://imgur.com/jU35evK) and I am *so* attached to them. They were born just a couple of weeks after I stopped drinking so it's been rewarding watching them grow and knowing I've been sober their whole lifetimes. Kind of like a kitten-shaped SD badge :)
Meh my dog still half-heartedly growls at me when I sleep restlessly which is frequent. She's great though truly my best friend. We're both kind of bitchy I guess.
