I drank earlier today. It has since worn off. I am so sad and ashamed and scared. I keep relapsing....going for a week or two then feeling better and going right back into it. I cannot keep doing this to myself. I almost bought another bottle of wine an hour ago....I was parked in front of Trader Joes ready to go in. I sat there in the car for a minute then I left. Luckily I was able to leave. I've been in and out of AA. I feel so sad and miserable. I have no real reason to drink....I need help staying accountable. I try to quit each time with the same resolve and sure enough EVERY DAMN TIME I fall back into it. Please help....

When you were in AA did you have a sponsor and work the steps?

There are local AA H&amp;I/12 STEP lines. If you google your local AA intergroup they'll hook you up with someone. The only requirement for AA membership is the desire to stop drinking but to stay sober you that desire needs to be accompanied by work you gotta put something in to get something out you need to be willing to do whatever it takes to stay sober. 
Do you live by yourself? If you have a roommate let them know. If not tell either a very close family member or someone that you see/talk to frequently. It's embarrassing but once they know you aren't alone anymore and you can share the guilt you feel in your secret drinking habits.
