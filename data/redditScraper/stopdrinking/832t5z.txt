I had it all figured out.  The treatment center wasn't going to test me this week so I thought I could drink a couple days before my next meeting without them finding out.  Turns out my last test was diluted and they wanted one today.  Had to say I was sick and use my one "discretionary absence."  They were cool but I'm sure they know and will be giving me a closer look from now on.  Why do I take these chances?  The relapse wasn't worth it.  It wasn't fun it just made me sick.  I had about 3 weeks clean and sober and was feeling good about myself.  Now I feel stupid and scared and just... low.  I will not drink with you today.

My friend we've all done things similar or none of us would be here.   Take the experience and learn from it.   Don't be to hard on yourself.   It won't do you any good in the long run.   I will not drink with you today.
Are you in a booze-free environment right now?
