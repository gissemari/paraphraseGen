And I haven't checked in yet. Things have been so incredibly busy (in a good way) with school and catching up on all the things I neglected  in the months prior that time has just flown by...Quick backstory: March 02 would have marked 3 years sober with the help of AA but in mid Feb. I relapsed and have been on and off since then...It feels good to be sober again. I feel productive and optimistic and my family is really proud of me but more importantly I am proud of me. ..Thanks SD! You've been a huge help..I think I'm becoming a bit of a carboholic but whatever keeps me sober today!
