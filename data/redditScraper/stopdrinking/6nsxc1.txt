This weekend my wife asked me if I ever anticipated drinking again. I thought about it and realized that any qualifications I would make -- "well maybe I'll reassess in a few months" etc. -- would just be a way of lessening my responsibility for a relapse and return to alcoholic behavior. I could literally feel myself trying to find the right combination of words so that I could appear responsible now but not commit to total sobriety so that I could leave open the door to drinking excessively again in the future...In the interest of maintaining total honesty (which I think is key to preserving my sobriety because it reduces the amount of stress from juggling lies which causes me to drink) I explained this insidious thought process to my wife: That's how sly my addictive brain is and that's why I have to go "all-in" on not drinking permanently. I've got to stay vigilant and remain one step ahead of this thing at all times because one unchecked impulse could mean a binge and a binge could mean total ruin for my family my career and/or my life...In other words I'm not drinking with you today or tomorrow or ever.
