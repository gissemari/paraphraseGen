I've officially hit "two weeks" and I'm struggling. Hung out with some friends this weekend and they had some whiskey & cokes (I didn't drink.) I'm feeling a lot of intense cravings for alcohol and just a general desire to have a drink to relax to have fun to chill out. I'm still toying with the idea of trying moderation so that's helping me rationalize having "just one beer." What do I do is there a way to get past the cravings? They're driving me insane.

This weekend I used some tips from here including stocking up on flavored seltzer and baking/eating cookies. I was stuck home alone after the kids went to bed and just so bored. I never really thought I had a problem with alcohol until 2 weeks felt like a really long time without it
In early sobriety eating something sweet helped me with cravings. I learned I could have a craving and not drink. They are temporary and will pass. ..When did you have "just one beer"?

As much as it sucks I have to avoid people who are drinking and places where there is alcohol. I've gone to bars during previous attempts at sobriety and it never works out. Even if I don't drink that night I end up feeling miserable. Cravings irritability even jealousy that others can drink and I can't... and I usually end up drinking.  ..It might be a good idea to avoid being around alcohol because let's be real... when have we ever moderated?
