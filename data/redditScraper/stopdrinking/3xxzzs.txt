So I had a traumatic incident happen to me back in 2007 which you can read my recollection of it in /r/LetsNotMeet [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/wn3zd/a_larper_gone_mad). The news stories are [here](http://www.10news.com/news/gunman-threatens-to-rape-vista-woman) [here](http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2007/sep/19/gun-wielding-suspect-arrested-in-vista/) and finally [here](http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20070920/news_1mc20vista.html). That last article kills me the most to read...*tl;dr is a man attempted to kidnap me at gunpoint with the intent to rape me as he had been pursuing me for months. I had stopped talking to him because he had invaded my privacy a week prior to the incident.*..This was back in 2007 and he got sentenced to 10 years. That would mean he's out in 2017 right?..**WRONG**..He's out on parole April 7th. The reason I'm posting here is because my 3 year soberversary is on March 24th exactly two weeks prior to him getting out. Now I have people I'm staying with in Australia who will help me fight off the urges to drink. They were supportive when I got the bad news a few days ago from my father...The conditions of his parole thus far is that he's under GPS monitoring for three years and is no longer allowed to return to my county. If he cuts his ankle bracelet off I will be notified immediately. Thankfully I'm in Australia until May. ..Basically what I'm seeking is any words of advice on how to keep the thoughts and fears from invading my mind and how to duct tape shut the voice of relapse. ..I'm  also approaching my 2 years clean off narcotics so I obviously have a lot at stake here to help me keep sober. ..SO basically any words of encouragement are greatly appreciated. Thank you...I love you guys and this sub.

I am so sorry that you are going through this fearful time /u/MorbidlyMacabre.  I hope you stay close to your IRL support network and maybe share with us on /r/dinos as well.  
I don't have any inspired words but just wanted to let you k ow that I'm here we are here for you whenever you need to vent.  I imagine it will be a very emotional time for you so please keep your support system close. The drugs and alcohol will not be the comfort and safety that your brain will try to convince you of at times they would be the opposite. I will be thinking of you and sending positive thoughts. Stay safe and sober my friend. 
Hi M..This is a very difficult thing you are dealing with. I survived a sexual assault by a stranger several years ago. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time and I had been drinking so my instincts were dulled and perhaps that made me an easier mark as a victim. I did not deal with this in the healthiest of ways. I stopped going out. I tried seeing a therapist I was referred to by victim services but I found her to be kind of judgey and unhelpful. I think she was pushing me to confront my drinking but I felt like she was blaming me for the rape. She also urged me to take self defense classes. I stopped seeing her I stopped going out to public events I started to drink alone at home instead of in social settings with others. ..In retrospect I think her advice to me was well intentioned and good advice but I wasn't ready to hear it and couldn't hear it at the time. And was delivered with a large number of "you shoulds". So I am trying really hard to speak from the "I" right now. ..I am not sure if sharing my story is helpful at all but in case it is I wanted to offer it to you...I feel like my (very new) sobriety makes me more fully present in the world. I feel safer in public than I have in years. Thinking about you  and reflecting back in my experience is making me consider actually signing up for a self defense course or taking a martial arts class...I also know that my anxiety is diminished when I do not drink. There are  biochemical reasons for this. It's not just some crazy idea of mine. :)..I wish you peace of mind and heart. 
That's a rough situation and I'm sorry you are going through that. I've never been through anything remotely close to that so I can't offer advice there but for the drinking I think relying heavily on your support system where you are and on the subreddit are key. ..You've been through so much and are stronger because of it...Stay safe and sober good luck!
