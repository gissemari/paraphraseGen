I will give you a few hints:.. - He (and his mates) tirelessly give to this forum on a daily basis.  They often deal with expectations from us that can be unrealistic.  We frequently forget that they are all dealing with the **exact same struggles of recovery** as we are.  They all have their own personal lives and do the work they do here on SD as a service to others without ever getting paid... - He is a wonderful example to those of you who are looking for a way to recovery that does not inclued AA.  He honestly tried it and simply found that it was not for him.  .. - And finally if he were walking down a dark alley and you tried to surprise and mug him there is little to no chance you would be able to succeed...If you figure it out please wish him congrats as I am doing right now.  Also today might be a good day to send a message (public or private) to those people here on SD who do that thankless job of keeping this place up and running for the benefit of **everyone** who comes here seeking recovery...Have a great day Saturday everyone.
