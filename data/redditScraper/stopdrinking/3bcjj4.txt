This is probably going to seem more than a bit disjointed. I'm a 27 year old academic lady in the northwest and i've been battling addiction to various things ever since I have had access to intoxicants. I don't know why but i've never been able to turn them down. I've abused stimulants off and on for five years and have been an alcoholic since the age of 17. I recently got access to a Fentanyl analogue and found myself using it pretty much all the time and have had multiple multiple blackouts on benzodiazipines..I'm just tired of this. People tell me all the time how cool I am how smart I am how caring I am and nobody can understand why i'm not capable of loving myself. I just honestly don't know how. I'm a lesbian from North Carolina and grew up internalizing a lot of bigotry and until recently spent my entire life around rural poverty and a culture that told me that my natural instincts would make me burn in hell. I was raised by a single mother who grew up in drug culture and often sold narcotics to support us..The first time I ever did cocaine was with my mother..I quit drinking two months ago but immediately started abusing my prescription stimulants and anxiety meds. Last night I went to a Pride event due to a supreme court decision that worked out in my favor. It was being held at a popular brewpub locally and I arrived early and had a stout..I met another queer person from North Carolina who started buying me cider and shots. One drink turned into seven. I danced with a couple of people but cannot remember the night..A friend of mine told me while we were dancing I got too close and too flirty. This is not normal behavior for me. It made her uncomfortable and I am very big normally on consent. I would have not flirted with her when sober. Ever. I'm a radical feminist and i'm extremely respectful of other people's boundaries and up until now I have never ever done anything like this while under the influence. I'm not a violent person. It terrifies me that I was capable of that..I feel like an ideological hypocrite and like I lost the battle. I'm in a weird place where my feelings are absolutely crushing me and I would -really- like to drink or do opiates. I would love nothing more than to embrace Morpheus in his warm blanket of love..But I know I can't do this..I want to survive long enough to get my PhD. I want to never fucking drink again. I want to be able to use my meds for their intended use. I don't even know if this is the right subreddit but i've got so many factors at play here that it seemed appropriate..AA and NA terrify me because of the religious component. I grew up around neo-nazis and the KKK and have a very very large distrust of programs that involve faith. What should I do?

Forgive me if I'm wrong...but this DOES seem a bit disjointed.  Are you sober as you type this?..Concerning your situation last night:  When drunk I was definitely inappropriate with friends and people with whom I never should have crossed boundaries.  I nearly lost some friendships this way..and had a lot of guilt about it.  As part of my recovery I've apologized and owned up to some of those friends.  Some relationships were fixed.  Some weren't...but I'm not the same person anymore...On the subject of AA and NA:  There are many ways to get sober many paths and many resources available.  Intensive Outpatient Treatment rehab programs like SMARTrecovery...even Athiest and Agnostic AA or NA meetings (I just went to my first Agnostics AA meeting last night.  As an agnostic and free thinking person it was great!).  ..I found the best place to start was by talking to a therapist and a doctor...and reaching out to family and friends I could trust.  Building a support system was vital for me.  In my case AA helped me make sober contacts and develop friendships.  Religion isn't part of it for me.  I work the steps but do not believe in a specific "god"...and not everyone in 12 step programs do.  There are many of us out there.  ..Whatever way you get there if you know you have a problem and are ready to make a change this is a great place to be.  Lots of supportive people here.  ..You can do this.  
Welcome /u/redgalatea to /r/stopdrinking.  I'm sorry that you have struggled with relapse.  Relapse is a HUGE part of my story.  I also deal with or dealt with manic-depression.  I got sober by doing the things I describe at the [Baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  As far as programs and faith--I hear you.  I'm super happy with my agnostic AA meeting home group which has enabled me to fully dive into recovery...Good luck to you.
i am atheist cannot stand any organized religion and have no trouble with AA meetings.  I love them.
I struggle with a deep distrust and dislike of most Christians. AA became my church because it is the only place I can say 'fuck' and 'God' in the same sentence and nobody bats an eye. 
Do you think you might need to go to rehab?
Finding a support system is the most crucial step. Whether that's AA (there are agnostic groups) SMART Lifering etc. depending on what's available your area. In early recovery it's important to have accountability and contact with others. When we're isolated our problems can seem insurmountable and unsolvable. Group meetings help us to remember we are not alone and others have gone through what we have. This is a great place as well but it's important to have that human contact. You may also want to consider inpatient or intensive outpatient treatment.
Hi of those folk who use 12-step programs there's plenty who are not religious nor even spiritual. There are also secular 12 step groups. A secular summary of the 12 step principles is given [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/39pzpb/the_agnostic_12_steps/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/32knb4/by_popular_request_a_revision_of_the_12_steps/). I'm not religious but they made sense to me that way. There's a /r/AtheistTwelveSteppers/ sub..There are other programs such as [SMART recovery](http://www.smartrecovery.org/) which are secular online meetings are available...Opiates are very addictive tolerance can shoot up quickly and in combination with benzos and/or alcohol can be particularly dangerous. There's also a /r/opiatesrecovery sub. ..There may be other treatment options (inpatient/outpatient) available to you. I find the [Saturday Shares](http://is.gd/rsdss) here inspiring and useful to relate to such as [this story](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/wz6o5/heres_my_story_its_on_the_youtubes/?ref=search_posts) which dips into rehab and has the amaxing quote *"I had no idea I was close to death"* - that's one of my motivators to stay sober...Good luck with your choices!
Hey friend. I was very much in the same boat as you not 150 days ago. I would like to suggest Women for Sobriety. I also grew up in rural poverty and terrifying religious fundamentalism in Central Louisiana and East Texas. I understand where you are coming from as far as that goes. WFS is a secular program that focuses on Women's addictions and recognizes the difference between why/how women become addicted to substances and how/why men become addicted. You have to contact them through this form first: http://womenforsobriety.org/beta2/contact/ as they have to vet out abusive spouses and such. .. I am also a very dedicated feminist and some of the language of AA makes me a little uncomfortable but WFS is very secular and very femcentric. Here are the twelve tenets: http://www.womenforsobriety.org/wfs_program.html.  ..The first thing you need to do however is get detoxed safely and speak with a therapist about your Manic Depressive episodes.
