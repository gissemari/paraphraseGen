I need a badge reset. ..I haven't visited here in some time and I'm both happy and sad to see the number 45 next to my name. I didn't realize it had been that long (it seems like such a long time) which makes me feel happy that I made it that far but also sad that I have to start right over again. ..I had a very stressful few weeks between work and my personal life and I thought to myself "I need to treat myself and just enjoy one beer". But I couldn't even hold it to just one. Which I can see turning into trouble if I continue again down that road...It's kind of funny because when I first started reading all the posts here and some of them being badge resets I saw the same thinking- "I've been doing so well how can one drink hurt?" and remember thinking "No! It's a trap!" but I succumbed to the same line of thinking. Funny how that works sometimes...I've been meditating daily and reassessing my spiritual life and I know that this will pass too but it's still a bit of a downer...I'm not drinking with you today.

Welcome back. A lot of people don't make it back. That sounds dramatic but I've learned that to be the case... the dreaded "I'll have just one" has caused many people to relapse including myself... I still struggle with those cravings. I saying I read on here has been tremendously accurate; "I can say no to the first drink but not the ones that follow." There's been several days I've had to recite this to myself over and over to not take that first drink.
That I'll just have one never works for me even if I pull it off I'm not satisfied and soon lose complete control because the truth is ones too many and a hundred isn't enough
