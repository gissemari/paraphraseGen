My first birthday sober since I was 14. I didn't want to make a big deal about it this year just between finances tension in the extended family whatever...But honestly I didnt even plan anything because nothing sounded good. Nothing seemed worth doing  without fun girly birthday drinks. ..I was not worried i would relapse but worried i was just going to be mopey and self centered. The turmoil kept me up all night finally I got out of bed and went to a 615am meeting since I couldnt sleep anyway. I got some great feedback and advice and accountability partners to help me tackle my day. ..So I survived my sober birthday even had a little fun made some new friends at a new meeting bought some tools and crafta to try making jewlery for fun ate whatever i wanted. ..Ive always been on the skeptic side of the magic of AA but when i had a problem and went to alcohol it never helped anything. AA is taking my problems giving me perspectives about only controling what i can accepting what I cant control. I have had a few close calls but now I have these tools like so many people i can call my safety plan reading the big book hitting my knees it has worked everytime. ..Thank you for letting me share and thank you for nkt drinking with me today.

&gt;bought some tools and crafta to try making jewlery..I'm a little jealous; this sounds *really* fun. A very Happy Birthday and many more.
Happy happy birthday! Sounds like you utilized some great sobriety tools which is one of the best presents you could have given yourself!! (Making jewelry sounds like an awesome present too!!)
