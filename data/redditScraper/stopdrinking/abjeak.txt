Hit 9 days last fall but then relapsed.  Time to start over.  I think this time I may try to pair it with Crossfit or Orange Theory or some kind of exercise and nutrition change.  A few years back I kicked it for 2-3 years straight doing that.  Then I changed jobs moved got lonely fell off the wagon (both exercise and healthy eating) and here I am again...We shall see if it will work again...I will not drink with you today.

CrossFit!!! It has improved my life in so many ways. 
Welcome back! I am also coming off a relapse and the idea of a sober 2019 and beyond sounds fan freaking tastic! IWNDWYT.
