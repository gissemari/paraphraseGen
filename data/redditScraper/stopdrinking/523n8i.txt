Hi everyone ..I'm new to this subreddit. I quit drinking for 3 months for a variety of reasons over two years ago and I felt better was sick less and lost a ton of weight without trying. I'm currently going through a high stress masters program and I'm finding myself drinking more and more. I'm feeling depressed and apathetic more and more frequently. I want to cut alcohol out for a while to see if it helps me with everything.  My biggest challenge will be that a lot of the socializing with my peers happens at bars so it's going to be a struggle. I'm hoping this sub will help me stick to my guns and get through till the holidays. Day 1 here we go!

I'll gladly join you in not drinking today! For myself I'm not looking to start back up at any point it hasn't gone well for me &amp; I'm a better person sober but I've seen people with shorter term goals here. This sub has been great! I use it by committing to post or reply at least once every day and when I'm feeling vulnerable I can always come here and it reminds me what my goal is and why.
