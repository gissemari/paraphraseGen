Dear oldest drinking buddy...Today we have our yearly Christmas drinks thing with all the fellas. You know how it's gonna go. We'll hit the same old bar smash down 10-15 cocktails during happy hour talk a bunch of inane shit and eat ourselves half to death. Today I'll be in fine form laughing slapping you on the back and joking about staying "hydrated" and "well-conditioned" over Christmas. I'll listen to your problems laugh at your terrible jokes and give you sage (yeah right...) advice. ...But the truth is mate I don't give a fiddler's fuck about you. I don't care about your life or struggles or anything you have to say. Behind my hail-fellow-well-met rascally facade is an ever-watchful addict and manipulator. I'm only here to get loaded to satisfy my yearning for more -- you're just preventing me from having to do it in my room alone. I also think your drunken antics are hilarious and I'm happy for you to humiliate yourself in front of the guys today because that means I'll be the second drunkest person in the room and that's how I always have it. ...What's more old boy I don't care that you're dangerously close to the edge of the drinking cliff and that it's ruining your marriage and your life I'm too busy getting my load on and after all that's why we're really here....So here's to Christmas old friend our friendship and the good times ahead. You look like you're about to pass out but listen...I'm talking...traditions like this are important and while women will come and go our friendship will remain. .."Barkeep get him another drink." ..Merry Christmas.

brutal. there is a lot of cold sad truth in this...i cannot think of a single relationship in my life that was improved with alcohol.
