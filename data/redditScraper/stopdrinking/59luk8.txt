I want to quit. I need to quit. I'm so tired of these relapses and I don't want to make those I love go through this again...I worked in a kitchen where everyone took shots during and after their shift. At first it was all fun and games but then I realized I was going into work drunk and leaving work drunker than ever to compensation for the brutal ass kicking we got every night. It was fun at the time but it was affecting my relationship with my SO and my relationship with myself. I was a mess smoking and drinking myself away but we finally moved to another state and I was so determined to start again without booze or nicotine to help me through the day...And so. I quit. I stopped smoking and drinking and I was finally alive. My relationship was what I called honeymoon-esque and we were happy again. I was the person my SO started dating and I had goals again. We were happy and very much so...Flash forward to a couple of months--we needed money and the only opening I could find was in kitchen work. No problem the place I was working for was very anti-drink and anti-smoking. Things were so easy and fun until we actually opened then shit hit the fucking fan. We're disgustingly busy with just two line cooks pushing out 600 covers a night Everyone seemed to fall back into their vices and we're all getting wasted after shift smoking nearly a pack a night. I get one day off and the whole day I'm drinking which fuels my anxiety but I don't know what else to do. I know it's making me miserable. ..So sorry for the wall of text. I'm getting out of the industry I'm quitting drinking. I can't live this life anymore and I can't focus on going back to school if my whole day is wasted with me  being drunk. I want to be happy. I want my SO and I want him to have a fulfilling life too. I'm not bringing us down anymore.

Stress drinking was my downfall.  I didn't realize how much it exponentially affected my already alcoholic tendencies.  Are there some aspects of your life that you can reduce pressure?  My sober journey has been eased a lot by removing as much as I can.  I quit one of my jobs stopped trying to do way too much and made time for myself finally. Good luck to you.
