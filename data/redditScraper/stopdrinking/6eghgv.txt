I have money in the bank again so not feeling too hopeful.

Maybe spend that money on something else like a movie at the theater or admission for you and a friend to an amusement park or a new video game or something nice for your house/apartment/room. Use it to explore the world a little with sober eyes! You can do another day. People are here doing it with you. You already have 5 under your belt!! That's awesome! 
Have you decided already that you are bound to drink?  I ask only because I have dealt this question to myself.  It is hard to shut the door totally.  I'm still working on this.  I have verbally said and typed "the door is shut" but I was lying.  I don't know if anybody can truthfully say it really. Maybe they can.  All we have is today.  TODAY I will not drink with you. Tomorrow is another worry I can put out of my head for now.  I wish you well.  
I will not drink with you today. You can do it!!! 
I have money too - But im getting that new samsung g3 smartwatch instead of firing it off in some club buying ass vodka and beers with strangers only to have a hangover for a week...So. Spend it on something nice! .
