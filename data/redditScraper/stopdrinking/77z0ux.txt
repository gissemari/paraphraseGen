Have you tried AA?
Hey friend proud of you for coming back...I started getting better once I started to truly and deeply analyze my relapses. This not only helped me identify my triggers but also allowed me to develop effective coping mechanisms...The single most important thing is to never stop trying! Sending out some love and positive energy!
I've reset my badge countless times. 94 days is amazing as is 94 hours or minutes for some. Please look at how much you achieved in 94 days with only one occasion of taking that first sip...and we all know  what that leads to. Advertising and our society is ramming this stuff down our necks and into our heads and hearts like it's the most precious wonderful life affirming thing to do...don't be hard on yourself. You just fell for the bullshit lie...like I have and many others. I wish you a peaceful day and today I Will not drink x
94 days is amazing! Don't beat yourself up. You came back. And you're going to keep trying. That's all that matters. I hope you feel better soon. I won't drink with you today.
