There were some exchanges earlier about  does this get easier? ;  will I be struggling and  white knuckling' from here on? ; and u/lonelysnail1956 asked  do some just replace their obsession with alcohol to a new obsession of  not drinking'?  etc. etc.  I shared that I went through some phases and u/Poisonsx suggested I create a new post so here goes:..There have been 4 stages in my relationship to alcohol so far: Stopping   Building   Living   Giving ...Stage 1 - "Stopping" (the early going).  OMG......white-knuckling trying to ride through this craving that craving the pull of habitual behaviors......man that took a LOT of ENERGY!  Needed *vigilance*.  **On Edge** for potential slips.  Changing all my patterns.  Just getting through the cravings at night and the habits at night so I could go to bed and get up and go to the hospital the next morning.  Days were pretty easy because of work.  But right after work:  "BAM!"  The patterns struck.  The wine glasses *whispered my name*    So I focused on  NO..NO NO NO I will **Not** have a glass .. which was "stopping" me having the FIRST drink.  But it was a lot of energy to NOT DO something.  A "negative" energy.  Against something.  A Struggle...Stage 2    Building  new patterns.  After a few weeks of "not" doing things my focus shifted toward 'increasing the positive tools resources activities and fellowship'.  That was a POSITIVE energy in that I was now *building* something.  The struggle *against* alcohol-patterns was subsiding I was beginning to get positive energy from the *new* activities.  Sort of similar to a new exercise routine - really hard at first but then when some results start coming in you get a little excited about it - looking forward to going to exercise...Stage 3    Living Sober .  I now was no longer focused on "stopping drinking".  There was no 'struggle' anymore.  The urges the cravings were virtually non-existent.  An anomalous little twinge here and there but fleeting.  Now I'm **getting** energy from my Sobriety as opposed to being drained from the struggle of Stage  1.  The Sober energy is feeding me.  I'm no longer tired.  It's the new normal.  No longer  thinking of drinking'.  ..Stage 4    Living and Giving .  I'm living Sober and Giving Service.  Service to others.  Service to people with Alcohol Use Disorder who are struggling.  "Whenever someone reaches out for help I want a hand to be there."  Not only have the urges evaporated I stopped thinking about alcohol at stage 3 but now.....and I never thought this possible......I have an **aversion** to alcohol similar to second hand smoke.  ..Wow!  Just Wow!  If someone told me that early on that this was possible  I'd have said "yeah man but you didn't drink like me.  You're different from me.".But it happened.  The promises do come true...I invite other observations and experiences!..Just for today I forgo ONE drink   The First One.

This is such a brilliant post and resonates so completely with me. Thank you :) I feel such hope and strength from you.
Great idea to make this into a separate post! Love the words of wisdom ;).
Great post!..
Good stuff PG!  
This is inspiring! Thanks for sharing  
Thank you for this! 
Thank you!  I needed this and is spot on   
Excellent post.  Thank you.  Inspiring to me.
Excellent post PG I recognise these 4 stages in myself. For those that might be interested here are **MY** timescales for the 4 stages-..1. Stopping- This stage as described above took about a month by which time the pink cloud effect had nicely kicked in...2. Building- The foundations are probably in place now so I'm working on other layers too. I don't think this one will ever completely stop otherwise I might start slipping backwards.....3. Living sober- The last time I thought that being able to moderate would be nice was around month 4 when I was at a social gathering where others were doing just that and it fleetingly felt like I was missing out. I no longer think about drinking and have no desire to touch alcohol again...4. Giving- Much of my giving activity happens through the business community I network with alongside popping my head through these doors each day. This area is absolutely key to me remaining sober. If I let it slip and start to become more selfish that's when I perceive the problems will start...Just for today I forgo the first drink with you.
This really shows a great compartmentalizd wAy to look at each part of the journey . Very cool post.
Thanks for this post - really gives me something to look forward to. I'm in between the first two stages right now can't wait for the next two
Another thoughtful relevant and eloquent post by u/Prevenient_grace.  I've found my experience to be similar with the stages occasionally overlapping in places. I'm astounded at how much better life is now and urge newbies to just keep going...it totally does get better.
Great way to look at it. I love the later stages it is so fulfilling! 
Thank you for sharing your experience! It's so reassuring to read about the other people's experiences with quitting and know that what I'm going through is not abnormal. I'm definitely in stage 1 right now. It's so exhausting putting so much energy into not doing something. Hoping to get to those later stages especially the giving back stage!
This is great PG! Its comforting to see how similar my first few stages are with yours. In fact I honestly feel I am right in the middle of Stage 3 right now. Its a good place to be and I am hopeful for the future. 
Once again...brilliant!
I'm in your first stage and early on.  This post hit me because not only did it describe exactly what I'm going through and all my anticipated fears but described the future in a logical and concise way...Thank you for this.
