Waoh....am in unchartered territory now and i have all my friends on SD to thank for that. I have tried so many times before I care to count to stop but i hardly go beyond day 3. Until now. Until I stumbled on SD. Checking in here everyday and seeing people at various stages of sobriety made me realize that I wasn't alone in my struggles.....I shall not be drinking with you today.

That's a tremendous achievement. 
Congrats on 1 week! Nope you'll never be alone. You've got an army of us backing you up ;).
Awesome!  I share the same feelings about trying many times and only lasting a day or 2.  Checking in here is definitely helpful for me!
Congrats! It's nice to wipe that smile off your circle's face and replace it with a nice new #1!! Hard work I know! Good for you - I won't drink with you today!
Congrats on week one! For me that was the hardest - it became easier and more enjoyable every week after. I will not drink with you today.
That's awesome! Good for you!
