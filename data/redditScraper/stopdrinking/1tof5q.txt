[Here is my original post a week ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1t6e80/on_march_28th_2014_i_will_be_30lbs_lighter_and/) where I established my goal of sobriety and losing 30lbs in 100 days...On the sobriety front this is the longest I've been sober in several months but I'm not struggling nearly as much as I had expected. There were a couple of fleeting thoughts particularly after landing that interview where I thought "I should treat myself with some beer" or when I was out driving and I thought "If I turn there I could go get some beer" but I didn't. And that was that. Now is going to be the hardest part because I have to go to my mom's for Christmas dinner in a couple of hours and she always buys beer for me. I've been telling her to stop buying beer for a long time and I always feel bad that she went out of her way to get it so I cave and drink it anyway. Well this time I won't...For the most part this week I was feeling too sick to notice any physical withdrawals if I had any. I was restricting to <500 calories per day and netting about 8-10g of carbs per day so up until a couple of days ago I was hit harder than I've ever been hit by ketosis flu. And because of that my thoughts were far more consumed by being hungry and needing food than needing a beer hah. ..Anyway I started getting severe symptoms of potassium/magnesium imbalance. From my short stint in cardiac nursing I knew what to look for and monitored my heart. Well once I started getting severe palpitations and my resting heart rate shot up to nearly 120 I decided to reintroduce carbs and bump up my caloric intake to 600-700. I feel much better now and while it'll slow down my progress I'd rather not meet my weight loss goal in time than die trying at the ripe old age of 21...As far as my dream job it's not necessarily my dream job of all jobs but one of the most desirable jobs in my field IMO. It's a new graduate position meant for the winter graduating class but I have a leg up on them because I already passed the boards and have an active RN license hah. So I got the phone interview almost immediately and now I'm trying to study and cram as much as I can before the more technical in-person interview. It's on the neuro unit at our local hospital which is definitely one of the hardest branches of nursing but it's the closest thing to behavioral medicine where I'd like to eventually end up...Hopefully by my next update (probably just after my 22nd birthday about a week and a half from now) I'll have a good idea of where I stand on that. But for now I'm in high spirits and I'm actually enjoying the holidays for the first time. Happy holidays everyone!..**TL;DR**..^Abstained ^for ^a ^week ^with ^little ^struggle ^but ^ran ^into ^cardiac ^problems ^due ^to ^severe ^ketosis ^flu ^and ^had ^to ^change ^my ^diet ^plan. ^Slightly ^worried ^about ^Christmas ^at ^my ^mom's ^since ^she's ^one ^of ^my ^enablers ^that ^I ^can't ^cut ^out ^of ^my ^life ^but ^I'm ^confident ^that ^I ^won't ^cave. ^Cramming ^for ^a ^big ^interview ^on ^our ^hospital's ^neuro ^unit ^and ^planning ^to ^update ^next ^in ^a ^week ^and ^a ^half ^after ^my ^22nd ^birthday..

Don't drink today plan to stay sober tomorrow get to recovery meetings of some sort and one day at a time you are on your way to a happy and successful sober life full of countless opportunities.  Good luck!
Be careful. You're putting your body through crazy.  You dont have to be perfect by friday!  1000-1200  calories is still low and still a lot less than you were prob drinking. Not judging at all i'm a chronic restricter and my health has suffered. Awesome on no drinking.
Happy holidays to you too! As someone else who went on a diet when I quit drinking let me share a little secret: you don't have to restrict your calories so much. I kept mine at 1200 exercised only 30 minutes a day and still lost 30 pounds in 90 days.  The lack of liquid calories and how it slows down your metabolism was key. Being healthy is what is important ya know?  Please be careful. &lt;3
Be strong and confidant.  I just landed a nice med/surg nursing job at the same hospital that fired me in 1999 for having alcohol in my system at work.  Getting that job was at the top of my list of goals.
