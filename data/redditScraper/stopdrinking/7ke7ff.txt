Drank a lot yesterday and got away with it.  Spent the morning hiding the evidence and ringing people who I rang last night to ensure they didn't know that I was drink. Just went to the store and fought the urgent to buy more drink. This Disease is insane. I think that I am drinking because it is such a busy stressful and tiring time. I just wanted to rant.

Sorry you're struggling. Yes I agree this disease is insane and this time of year is especially difficult. Hang in there.
Rant on!  Whatever it takes to get yourself back together.  It is so hard and this time of year is hard on a lot of people.  Keep checking in here.  IWNDWYT
