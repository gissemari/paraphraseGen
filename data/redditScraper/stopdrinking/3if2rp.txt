This is my second round here..hoping to make this time count..So I'm seeing this new guy (6 mo?) he hosted a record signing event Sunday. Needless to say I got trashed due to social anxiety or whatever excuse you want to call it. I got trashed upset at him and decided to leave. He's not the bad guy I am. I left. Drunk. I don't know how this all happened because it's a blur but a group of people in a car managed to flag me over. I apparently pulled over the female in the car was angry and upset about my driving. She then said she decided not to call the cops on me but wanted to drive me home. You guys This woman I don't even remember her name. Drove me in my car home. A good 40 minute drive. Her brother followed and picked her up. I'm a 33/f and could have easily been raped/murdered.. some totally random people drove me home. This is not acceptable and I'm more than lucky that no one hurt me. Holy shit. Tomorrow I start day one. I have not told a single soul.. so here it is. The truth. I am so shamed. I've struggled with alcohol my entire adult life but I'm hoping this is it. No More.

What's the plan? 
It sounds like you're lucky you didn't hurt anyone else either. That was a very nice woman. What will you do to not drink tomorrow? Sounds like you're ready to make a change.
Don't waste your get out of jail free card.
