Hi all.....So I'm glad to say I'm 8 days sober and I have no need to reset my badge. Here's my story **(and I'll include a TL;DR at the end because I know I have a tendency to be wordy)**.....My local bar (a divey sports bar-type) is literally a half block from my home in LA. I've been frequenting this bar almost every single day for the last two years and I actually attribute the convenient location to really pushing my alcoholism past any controllable limit. I used to joke that I basically "own this bar" based on how much money I used to waste there on vodka every night. I've gone to this bar so often every day after 5pm that I have actually made quite good friends with the 3-4 bartenders and many of the regulars that frequent the joint. I'm a lonely guy without many friends and I usually went not only to drink but as my only means of socialization and watching any games that may be on that night. I would sit behind the bar and pound double after double of vodka...Needless to say my drinking reached a point where I couldn't even wait for the bar to open at 5pm anymore and I started buying bottles of vodka during the day just to hold me over until the bar opened (I am unemployed shocker)...I never denied I was an alcoholic and I've done the whole quitting thing multiple times over the last 6 months or so but could only get a day or two before I was inevitably back to drinking. Then a bit over a week ago I decided enough was enough bought and read [Rational Recovery by Jack Trimpey](http://www.amazon.com/Rational-Recovery-Cure-Substance-Addiction/dp/0671528580/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1370457524&sr=1-1&keywords=rational+recovery) bought and started reading [Alan Carr's Easyway](http://www.amazon.com/Easy-Way-Stop-Drinking/dp/1402736479) and checked myself into detox (which not being insured cost me a pretty penny-- all on credit that I have no way of paying back but that's another story)...So the last couple days have been a roller coaster of emotions but I knew this time to expect [PAWS](http://www.tlctx.com/ar_pages/paw_part1.htm) after all that nasty physical withdrawal was over. I became irrationally angry and irritable over small things and I could literally cry over spilt milk (this coming from someone who hasn't cried in nearly 15 years). ..Yesterday was a bad bad day. My car broke down the garage I took it to tried to rip me off and charge me $200 more than the job should have cost I lost my garage door opener and (it sounds silly) but I had no friggen quarters to do my laundry and **damn it I was OUT OF UNDERWEAR AND IF I HAD MY CAR MAYBE I COULD DRIVE AND GET CHANGE BUT NO MY CAR HAD TO BREAK DOWN** (see these are the little things that make me rageful shortly after quitting drinking I actually started punching my bed because of this last one and in retrospect it seems so over reactive it's ridiculous)...Now even though I stopped drinking I actually haven't stopped going to the bar. After all I really have no friends and being unemployed I have nothing to do and maybe if I had a single hobby outside of drinking I could do that but I realized that my only hobby had been drinking and I really didn't have any interests outside of that. But some days during my sobriety I would still go to the bar around 6pm and pound a couple ice-cold ginger ale's and maybe a couple of diet-cokes catch a few minutes of a game catch up with the bartenders and walk home. I know it sounds like it'd be a lot of temptation but I was serious about not drinking this time and even though a few patrons around me were ordering beers I knew I wouldn't be one of them anymore and I just wanted a social place to hang out drink some sugary drinks and walk home after an hour or so. Plus I caught up with my bartender friends. One of them I'll call him S. knew all about my drinking problem and knew I was "on the wagon." He would ask me every day how it was going and encourage me...So yesterday after this "miserable" day I had I went for my usual ginger-ale and luckily S. was working. I told him about my crappy day and the whole time I was staring at my usual brand of vodka behind the counter. I think I made-up my mind that "two shots couldn't hurt" and I just wanted to take some of the edge and anger off. ..I was shaking with agitation. I didn't want to drink I didn't want to undo my week of sobriety but I REALLY wanted those two drinks. But I knew *I knew* I wouldn't be satisfied with just two. I've been here before and I knew that even if it *was* only two drinks I'd regret the hell out of it later and just hate myself tomorrow...You know what I did then that helped actually? I busted out my smart phone and went on r/stopdrinking. And wouldn't you know it [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1fnmk5/1_week_today/) was the top post. The OP had the same amount of sober time as me and the comments were surreal on how relevant they were to my situation. This helped me A LOT. I decided to stick to my ginger ale. ..However about 15 minutes later I guess it just wasn't enough and I still wanted those two shots. I said to S. "S. I want the rest of what's in (my brand of vodka's) bottle. That's only two shots or so right?"..And from behind the bar he said "Don't do it M. Don't do it. Come on man it's not worth it don't do it."..It was like everything in the universe was trying to keep me from relapsing. And I kind of snapped out of it then. I went outside had a smoke thought it over and thought *He's right it isn't worth it at all. In one hour the effects will wear off and I'll just want to drink more. And I'll regret it probably even then but by then it'll be too late and I'll be back for more.* ..I stubbed out my cigarette and walked home. Thanks to /r/stopdrinking and a bartender I didn't drink. I didn't relapse. And I woke up today feeling fantastic. With no guilt and no regret. ..I know most of you will probably tell me how dangerous it is especially in early sobriety to even go to this bar. And I agree it is. But I want to be strong enough that I can walk into a place like that have a ginger ale and be able to have a nice conversation with a few friends or acquaintances and walk out. But maybe it is too early. Either way I need to find some sober friends. I need to get myself to a meeting I guess (even though I really don't jive with AA) and need to find some hobbies...Either way thanks guys. Thanks for letting me tell my little story. I haven't re-read it yet but I'm sure it's entirely wordy and super long so here's the.....**TL;DR:** Had a really crappy day 7 days into sobriety went to a bar where the bartender was a friend who knew I was on the wagon. Had huge urge to drink but instead read this subreddit and bartender told me not to do it and it wasn't worth it. Didn't drink. Went home. Feel great woke up without regret.

Man bless that bartender.  I'm really glad for you and for him too.  He seems like a good guy...It's true that you shouldn't hang out in drinking places early in sobriety.  Another truth is that no one ever follows all of the 'shoulds' in sobriety.  So to give a more limited recommendation definitely don't go to the bar on a day when your feeling that down.  And also limit your visits to when S is working maybe.  If I'm going somewhere where people are drinking having a person who knows that I shouldn't be drinking is a great help...Absolutely you should get some sober friends and some dry activities to do.  Best wishes.
Whooo! Good work!
It is too early.  How often can you count on the amazing luck you describe?  The bar will always be there later and when you have enough distance between you and your last drink you can go there without the risk.  That is if you still want to.  Give it a month or so before going back.  When you can pass by booze in a store without it tugging at your eyes or your mind then you know it is starting to lose its grip.
"Stay away from fucking bars".."Why did I get drunk again at a bar last night"..Two excerpts from a journal I kept in an effort a few years ago trying to get sober.  Please trust my research stay away from the bars!  ..**"If you hang around the barbershop long enough you are bound to get a haircut"**
You were very lucky on an unlucky day...I was a loner misfit blah blah. .I ended up in AA - am agnostic able to tune out god stuff..It replaced the false socialization of bars with real friends though that took a while as I was deeply socially handicapped....
Go you!!!!! This made me smile really big and tear up all at the same time. I don't even know you but I am proud. I'm a week sober and damn it's hard. I'm glad I can read stuff like this and get the motivation to keep going. Inspiring! Keep it up :) .
