Work is over I'm at home and it's my traditional time to kick back and work toward a black out. I've taken a walk I've played with the dogs and I really want a drink. I'm going to read all the new posts and reread all the old posts and I'm not going to drink today.

phone a friend! Get on the stopdrinking chat! Or and I highly recommend this one start a netflix season and watch episode after episode! ..Stay strong friend!
You can do this! Treat yourself...have a  nice bath or order in something delicious or do something you love that doesn't  involve alcohol. ..It is SO WORTH IT to ride out the cravings. I'm speaking to you from the future - its early on Saturday morning for me (I live in Asia) and waking up fresh on Saturday morning *without* the shame and regret and *with* a clear head and excitement for the day is an amazing feeling...and one that you can have too!
I've had a few moments where I really craved a drink much like you they were on a Friday evening after work.  My best advice is to spoil yourself!  Eat whatever you want!  Do whatever you want!  I like to make mocktails (I'll mix pomegranate juice and Perrier) and sip on those if I have friends over or if I'm watching TV.  Give the dogs a bath!  It doesn't really matter what you do as long as you're not drinking.  Remember why you started this journey and remember that we're all here for you.  :)  Good luck.
I am not going to drink TONIGHT in solidarity with you.  
What kind of dogs do you have?
