Hi guys I'm Zack I'm 23. Today is my 100th day of being sober(started the first day of 2018.) And yesterday I broke up with my girlfriend of 8 months. I've got crazy mixed feelings. My life is getting better in almost every aspect but having to cut out someone I care for is hurting me real bad. The urge to just say fuck it to the good habits I've built over the past year(I've been sober 7 out of the past 12 months I relapsed in the fall..) Is overwhelmingly strong. But I think I'll be okay. First time I came on this subreddit I was 20 or so and you guys told me then and there to stop drinking but I didn't listen. The older I get the more your wisdom has sunk in so I wanted to thank you for that. Don't really have a point to this post other than venting and sharing my accomplishment. Hope you are all well peace.

Congrats I wonder where I would be if I had this community to talk to when I was 20 or even 16 and starting to party.... .  IWNDWYT
