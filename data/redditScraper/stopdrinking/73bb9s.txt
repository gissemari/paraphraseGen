A lot of you have reached out to me and been really helpful to me after I've reached out to you over the last two weeks. If you haven't ready any of my posts I was really concerned abt symptoms I thought were associated with Liver disease (bloated hard belly itching muscle spasms/cramps red palms pain in right side under ribcage.)..I'm really grateful and lucky to say I had a bad case of googleitis as all of my labs just came back normal...I hit the two week mark yesterday and removing alcohol hasn't cured me of any of my problems on its own. I know remaining sober is going to be a daily struggle. I've had compulsions to drink even in the midst of what I thought was a life altering health crisis. Having said that I'm thankful to have found this community and hope to continue fighting for my sobriety and my life...I will not drink with you all today!

I almost Googled "googleitis" just then.
