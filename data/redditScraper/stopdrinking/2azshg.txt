Hey Kids I just wanted to check in and say "Hi" again.  120 days has certainly flown by...I apologize for not contributing much lately but I have been dealing with some health issues of my own some ridiculous work stress and now some health issues with a remote family member...After so many years of self-medication I have been very surprised to find how stress can manifest itself physically if it's not managed properly!  I really am seeing the value in making the next step from sobriety to recovery...I'm grateful for your posts; I continue to read the sub religiously each evening and feel "at home" when I do.  I will try to be more active soon...Thanks again for your support and sharing our struggles and accomplishments.

Stress is a peculiar booger. At one point every time I swallowed any thing other than tepid water when it hit a certain spot I had searing pain that radiated from my chest. I thought it might be a chemical burn in my esophagus from not taking a pill with enough water before going to sleep gall bladder ultrasound nothing endoscopy totally clear WTH?? It was esophageal spasms due to stress! That was the beginning of 18 years in and out of therapy. Only good thing was dropping 15 pounds but I don't recommend stress for weight loss!
I'm glad you checked-in. Hang in there and don't let the stress or health issues get you down.
Kudos for FOUR months! 
Happy 120 SuckIt!! I'm glad you've at least reading if not contributing. It's during those stressful periods that it's important to not isolate ourselves and revert back to our old coping mechanisms. So yay for reaching out today! Thanks for keeping us in your loop. :-)
