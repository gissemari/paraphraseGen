Hey everyone ..I had about 5 and half months sober and relapsed about 2 weeks ago. I just cannot do this any more. I am already drinking hard liquor during the day and have called out of work. ..Well lucky me I have insurance and a job right? I will go get treatment. ..$350 a day maximum on in patient treatment from my insurance. I am so fucked. I have called like 4 or 5 places trying to get help but everytime it is the same thing. 4k out of pocket.. 5k out of pocket. One place that is not even very nice told me 11k! out of pocket. ..If anyone has any experience getting help with shitty insurance please let me know. Because I thought I had a great Blue Shield of California Gold PPO and I am currently fucked. ..Currently sober but hungover.

I'm glad you made it back /u/welpimonaride; many don't. You could check into outpatient a therapist and AA. All of those resources were very helpful to me.
