I'm attending training for work and a guy I met in class wanted to have dinner. As soon as we walked in there were a couple seats at the bar so we just sat there. He had a few beers during the course of dinner. We talked for a couple hours and had a great conversation..A little over a year ago I would have sworn to you that this scenario would have never played out for me. Why would I not drink? If I wasn't going to drink why would I sit at the bar? How could I just sit and have a conversation with someone *while they were drinking and I wasn't?*..Yet here I am. It was one of the most enjoyable conversations I've had in recent memory...and the best part? I didn't crave a drink one time. I ordered a regular water and the only time alcohol even popped into my head was when I thought to myself "I'm sure glad I not drinking because if I did I would surely be hungover for class tomorrow"...I just wanted to say this. If you're thinking about quitting or you've just quit or you're struggling for whatever reason...please know that it gets better. It might not seem like it and that might seem like some shit that we just say but I promise you that it does...I won't drink with you all today :)

Congrats my friend! That was one of the best feelings for me when I was able to be around it without bugging out. It really felt like an accomplishment!
