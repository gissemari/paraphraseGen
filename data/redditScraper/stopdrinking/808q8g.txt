I didn't post here before this because I didn't want to jump the gun and regret it. But for the third time in 16 years I've hit the 7th day without alcohol. It feels different this time like I might actually make it over this hill. I'm struggling tonight but I bought some La Croix and I know I'll make it through. I've lurked here a long time trying to build up the nerve to post and get some momentum going. Tonight I won't be drinking with all you fine people. Thanks for helping me know I'm not alone
