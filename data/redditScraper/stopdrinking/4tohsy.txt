No congratulations or anything needed just wanted to say that if you're struggling to stop do your best to make the decision now. Alcohol for us is a haven of poison. It's nothing but a distraction. It's strange coming home after work and not popping open a beer or pouring a bourbon and then zoning out doing absolutely nothing that helps me grow or improve. Use the time you're not drinking to do so. Not trying to lecture I'm only a week in but I already see improvements in myself and my focus and my motivation. It will be a long road but we all have to pick up our bags and start walking at some point. Do your best and stay healthy and thank you to this community not for how you've only motivated me but for how you've done so for others. Stay gold.

The hardest part of being alcohol free for me is having to face the pain and frustration that I used to try and drown. But with each day it becomes easier. With each passing day I hit a new record of sobriety since I started drinking 11 years ago. Glad to see you're making progress! I won't drink with you today :)
first week is huge. you can't make me not congratulate you :)
Good on you man! Yeah I'm excited about the possibilities. I've been listening to some Tony Robbins stuff and studying quite a bit. I've wasted so much time being drunk and avoiding success. I think it's time to make up for that. Hopefully we can meet each other at the top of the mountain one day..
