So over at r/AskWomen there's a question about whether or not it's reasonable to tell a significant other who's an addict that you can't be with them when they're using and that you'll leave them if they relapse. My immediate thoughts were that yes that's absolutely reasonable but it also made me realize that I have this belief that addicts relapse that's just what we do that an addict in recovery will inevitably relapse at least once. Despite that it was true for me that's not something I want to believe. I get that this is why we have to think one day at a time because if we don't then the future yawns open huge and full of these possibilities. But I also get very sad when people set their counters back to day one and when I did not just because of the relapse itself but because it makes it seem like the previous however-many days didn't count weren't the enormous accomplishment they really were...I'm not sure where I'm going with this but it's really getting to me tonight. Have you relapsed before? Do you think it's an inevitable fact of life? Or did you nail it on the first try? 
----------immediate responses--------

The first time I thought I should stop drinking I was able to quit about 3 or 4 days and then I continued to drink for years.  ..This is the first time I've tried AA and so far it's been working for me.
I'm one of the lucky ones. From my first AA meeting I have never relapsed. I know a few others like that in the groups I attend. As I said I feel very fortunate because I am pretty sure that if I ever decided that I'm "cured" or could "moderate" or in any other way be what I am not - a "normie" - that I would be back out there full blast within days and never come back. That's why I just plod along working my program one day at a time. Works for me. Today's a good day tomorrow will be better.
Once I committed to sobriety and started working a program of recovery I have never relapsed.
Went to rehab in 2011 admitted I was alcoholic have been sober over 3.5 years. No relapse.
I relapsed after 15 years of continuous sobriety and NO I don't think relapse is inevitable.  Had I continued to do the things I describe in the [Baby Steps post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) I do not think I would have relapsed.
In the beginning I slipped and slid.  Since then thankfully not...Relationships are difficult enough without the lies and other assorted drama of active drinking/drugs/whatever (including infidelity)...To accept someone else as active is to activate our inner doormat.
I am trying not to relapse. This is my first time to seriously decide to stop drinking..But I think if my husband told me he would leave if I relapsed it would make this battle about ten thousand times more difficult..Why say that to someone? Maybe I don't understand the circumstance. I have always been the drunk in the family surrounded by sober people..I have kicked drugs before to so if you are dealing with that... Well honestly for me anyway it was a lot easier than getting off my baby bottle;)
Before I decided to quit drinking entirely one day at a time I did 30 days sober. ..I then had wine with my wife for our anniversary. Then she went to Tokyo on business and I was sad and alone. I drank alone. ..**The thing about that "relapse" is that it is not as if the previous 30 days didn't happen. Those 30 days sober are a very real part of history. They not only happened but they helped me realize that I wanted to quit for the long-term one day at a time. I drank and it sucked. I realized I'd much rather not. It was amazing. A revelation. I personally on my own volition do not WANT to drink. Amazing. All because of 30 days sober AND A RELAPSE.**..**If somebody relapses and very soon thereafter returns to the sober community I see a net benefit. Clearly they must have realized that alcohol was not the solution to whatever problem they were experiencing in sober life and have decided to come back and address it.**..Personally I think my wife would be disappointed if I relapsed. When I entered sobriety she would have stone-cold left if I drank again. Maybe as time goes on she will be more willing to understand that possibility/eventuality. I hope we never have to address it. 
My wife has made it clear that she would be willing to do anything she could to help and support me as I journey through sobriety even demanding that I enter residential treatment if it ever comes to that; but that she will never leave or threaten to leave me unless the time comes where I become directly abusive.  I find this resolve on her part to be in it for the long haul with me stabilizing and supportive; not enabling.
The first time I quit I went to a handful of meetings maybe a month or so but never had cravings or urges and I stayed sober for two years.  A complex combination of depression and marital problems developed and I got back in the habit of using booze to escape it.  ...Sometime earlier this year I decided to beat back the depression by going to counseling.  I started exercising feeling better physically and mentally but tried managing this while drinking in moderation.  It didn't work.  Eventually the booze started to become the priority again and I just recently decided/realized that I can't handle moderation.  ...It's been a little over a week now and I feel confident that my trial and error methods have shown me the right path.
Relapse is not necessary or inevitable. It has not happened to me nor will it today...Thanks for your wise post and question.
Hey we're close on our sobriety dates :) Let's never relapse together!
I am a newbie still I suppose. I am closing in on 3 months though and I've been doing a lot of thinking over my last 15 years of alcohol abuse. Relapses have occurred *planned relapses* I like to call them...When I quit drinking before it was always for the wrong reasons. The biggest two were to prove to those people who were bugging me about it that I didn't have a problem. See I could stop for one week or two weeks. Sober up for a month sure. No problem here. The second reason was to prove to myself that I was ok when the amount and frequency of my drinking started to scare me...But in my mind I knew I would return to drinking. I had planned my relapse before I even quit. This was the biggest reason for me going back. I **chose** to relapse. I could have chosen not to but back then that wasn't a choice I was willing to make...I guess it's different for everyone and relapses can be learning experiences but the actual relapse happens when a choice is made to do so. No one or no thing *makes* someone take a drink after swearing to sobriety. Only when that person chooses to give in can a relapse happen...I don't think they are inevitable as there are many people who have quit and never looked back. That is the person I am working to be. I just don't want it anymore. I am totally done with it. I allowed myself to accept the choice of never drinking again forever more. That's the difference in this grasp at sobriety this time. Where I always planned my return I am now planning my never return. Total reworking of the brain and how it thinks. That's been the toughest part for me because when you get caught up with alcohol it can become whatever you want it to be. It can substitute for anything so it's always there for you. It always "helps" you until you realize it doesn't help you at all and never did. ..It's a maddening time to be at the decision point. Do I drink don't I drink. I haven't drank in X. Do I want to throw that all away? Do I drink don't I drink? That recording can drive you insane until mentally and emotionally you are scrambling to find a drink just so you can silence it. At that point you have to be stronger than you ever thought possible and you have to choose to remain sober no matter what. It's not easy but attaining great things never is...So I guess that's my take on relapses. I think they are chosen. They just don't up and happen to someone. The are decision points in sobriety. ..I don't even worry about relapsing now. I have the wild craving every now and then or the passing thought of some good time I had drunk and want a sequel but I just don't want to be that person any more. That outweighs my desire to ever pick up another alcoholic drink.
