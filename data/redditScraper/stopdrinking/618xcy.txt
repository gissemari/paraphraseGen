i dreamt that i relapsed and i could feel the disappointment and devastation  even though those dreams feel horrible i think they're a good reminder and just an overall good thing for sobriety. a reminder that a drink is never the answer and it never helps or makes anything better.and a good thing because it pushes you forward if you're in a vulnerable state. it also helps you to be more grateful and happy that you're still sober because you wake up like ahhh it was just a dreamyou feel as if you got a second chance..and the fact is ..all of us who are sober are in fact getting a second chance and it's not something that should be taken for granted ...do you ever get those relapse dreams?

Yes had them for a week straight starting a few days after I first quit.  Had lots of other weird creepy dreams too. Did you have them early on or is this your first one?
Freebies. ..The old drunk dreams.  Comes with the territory. ..They get further apart as you go along  in my experience anyway...They are quite unnerving at times.  It's been awhile since I've had one.  Don't miss them at all....Enjoy today.
