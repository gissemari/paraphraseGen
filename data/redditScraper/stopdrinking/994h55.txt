Been thru a lot during the last year.....personal issues weddings parties travel to Italy dining out....realized that I did not have to drink to experience life. In fact I wasn't really experiencing life to its fullest because I was drinking thru it.  I do not need alcohol it doesn't improve me or my life. Look forward to enjoying what life I have left  (78 yrs old)  without it...For those of you starting out or struggling to get sober  and I see that most of you are much younger than I believe me it is well worth the effort to make a better life for many years to come. The best investment you will ever make is in yourself!
