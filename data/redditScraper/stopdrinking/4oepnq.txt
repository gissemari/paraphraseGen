Has it ever worked for any of you? I am struggling with the thought of relapsing into my binge drinking habits...Have tried in the past and always end up cheating myself. For example I'll tell the wife that I'll only have a six pack but drink another one in the parking lot before bringing the six pack home. Or I'll wait till she leaves for work and break out the stash bottle...I think back on stuff I've done in the past to hide my drinking and how lucky I am to have a job and never got a DUI...Hypnosis? Lobotomy? Exorcism? Nazi brainwashing like the winter soldier?..Why is it so hard just to say I'll never drink again? I know I have no physical dependence on it...I realize the truth already I just need to talk it out I guess...Thanks for being here for us lurkers on the edges.
