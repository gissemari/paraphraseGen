Having a craving. It's mildly strong. I'm feeling a bit hopeless because I relapsed recently so I'm calling this what it is - it's the chemicals in my brain readjusting it's my addiction talking not me. I'm posting here for accountability. I'm going to take a shower then bug out over to a friends house. Drinking is arsenic to me. It causes me nothing but pain and this craving will pass just like it always does.

Cravings are tough. Changing you location and focusing on something else will remove the fixation. Be tough - IWNDWYT
