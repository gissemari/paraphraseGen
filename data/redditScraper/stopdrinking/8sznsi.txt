A year ago this month my life was a mess. I hated my job myself and everything in and about my life. The only thing I belived gave me joy was to drink . Over the past year  I've worked to turn this round. I've finally changed my job and found something more rewarding. I'm learning to accept and love my kids as the people they are and not who I want them to be. I appreciate and love my life my family and my home. finally after years of self loathing and pity me I feel blessed and supported. After  many many attempts I feel ready to let go of my struggle with alcohol. No more running away from life with the bottle
