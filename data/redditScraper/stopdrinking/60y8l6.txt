Bare with me here. ..When my kids were babies I read some very good advice re bed time. The advice was you had to put them to bed in time to catch the 'sleep train'. The sleep train stopped by around 6.30pm when they were really tired. If you let them catch it (put them to bed) they tend to sleep well. ..If you missed the sleep train it left the station and your baby would have trouble falling asleep and wouldn't sleep well during the night. It always worked. If they missed the train they missed that important window where they were at the perfect point of tiredness to sleep well. Now they are 9 and 13 and they still have trouble falling asleep if they miss the train (it arrives about 8pm for both). ..Now that I've stopped passing out every night I'm finding my sleep train stops by at about 9pm. Last night I missed it (decided to watch a movie instead). I had trouble falling asleep and didn't sleep soundly at all. ..I'm going to pay attention to when the sleep train comes and make sure not to miss it. I'm hoping it starts to come later in time but I'm in the early days of recovery and not in charge of the sleep train's schedule yet. It comes when it comes it's up to me not to miss it. ..I hope this helps anyone who is struggling to fall and stay asleep. ..Choo Choo!

I just smoke a nice fat blunt to get me sleeping 
I like the idea of this and it makes sense to me. I've been trying to get to bed earlier because I was staying up and drinking before and I want to avoid that temptation. 
I like this! A nifty way to think about it.
