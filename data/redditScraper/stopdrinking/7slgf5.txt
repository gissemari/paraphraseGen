Anybody do this? Over my short stint of sobriety I've found out that orgasms really help deal with intense cravings for me. I'll either masturbate or have sex with my partner if she's down and around and it does wonders! Cravings go away after cuz I masturbated and then I get distracted by the post porn watching shameful feeling. Or I had sex and I'm distracted by the post sex glow and the fact that I can usually cuddle after. It actually helps a lot more than I thought. However because of this I've been masturbating a lot more lol. Orgasms and cigarettes have helped quite a bit who knew!..Despite my positive tone this shit is really hard and I'm struggling to not drink. Sometimes I feel like I gotta force myself to stay at home and not go outside.   I guess I'm just posting this shit to distract myself because I can't sleep and I want a drink so badddd. Thankfully all the bars and stores are closed now but these cravings are fucking intense. Its like there's someone literally pushing me and yelling in my ear to have a drink. I have to be up in 3 hours but I can't sleep fuck me. ..Sorry for the late night rambling.

I get it. I went to bed three hours ago and am still up. Did an hour and a half of meditation and still can't get away from my thoughts. 
It works for me too but it's not like it was when I was drinking or how I remember it used to be. It gets easier day by day as your dopamine returns to normal function.
It's the addictive nature of the brain. Booze hits similar receptors in your brain. Once you cut the alcohol you crave an alternative. Thus a craving for an orgasm...There's a great boom called Staying Sober that breaks this down a bit more.
