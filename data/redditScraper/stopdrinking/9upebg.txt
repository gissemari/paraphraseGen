It's been very rough the past couple years for me. Ended a 5 year relationship with my SO and had two kids out of it. I really can't stop it feels like. It's hard for me and I can't seem to stop. I want to quit but the drive to do so is harder then I ever thought to be possible. Looking for advice I guess.

I couldn't do it on my own. I called my doctor and tried to get a therapist.  The doctor prescribed meds to detox safely.  The therapists who return my call suggested Intensive Outpatient rehab at the local hospital.  Rehab suggested AA.  I followed the suggestion and I've been serene and sober for over 2 years
I discovered that is was easy for me to *Create* a Drinking nking problem all npby myself.  However I can't *Solve* a drinking problem without support...Glad you're here.  Lots of support...I was spiraling down.... down...Caught in a vicious cycle...Then I did ONE little thing different.  I went to a recovery meeting and listened.  I found people who understood because they had experienced it.  Instead of "judging" me they welcomed me.  They helped each other get sober and helped me get sober!..Tried a meeting?
Welcome! To begin is always the hard part. Once the drug is out of your system it becomes a mental game. I and many others found [Allen Carr's *Easy Way To Control Alcohol*](https://books.google.com/books?id=yPlPhQNv3RcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) helpful. He believes it's not a matter of willpower but a matter of mindset. I think I finally had the epiphany but it took time. Be easy on yourself and don't quit quitting. Food before the witching hour helps me overcome the cravings.
