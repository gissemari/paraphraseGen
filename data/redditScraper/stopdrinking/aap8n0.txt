  ..Hi all! Fair warning this is a loooooong post so I understand if you don't read. In fact I'm not writing for others to read so much as I'm writing it for myself. To see it right in front of me might help the next time I think I can drink. ..&amp;#x200B;..TL:DR Alcohol is the fucking worst. DON'T DO IT ..&amp;#x200B;..And awwaaaaaayyyyyyyy we go ..&amp;#x200B;..Context: I have alcoholics and addicts on BOTH sides of the family. I watched my uncle kill himself with alcohol and I'm still watching another uncle do the same today. My parents never really drank when I was a kid and they still don't really drink. Spoiler alert- I have major daddy issues. My father was very harsh and extremely critical when I was growing up. I literally couldn't do anything right and anything I did do was a huge disappointment and/or inconvenient for him. Joy...&amp;#x200B;..I had my first drink when I was 15 Smirnoff Ice at my friend's apartment. Her mom offered it to us and she frequently drank in front of us and glamorized it. Young and impressionable I thought she was such a cool mom and I wanted to be **just** like her. ..&amp;#x200B;..After that first drink I never really had much interest in alcohol until my senior year in high school. My friends liked to party every weekend at a particular persons house who's whose mom let us drink there thinking it was safer if we were under her roof instead of some park at 9 o'clock at night. This was on the weekends and I never really drank a ton like my friends did never had a hangover really and never vomited from drinking. I have this really strong memory from one of those parties that sticks with me today. We had run out of booze in the house and the only thing left was wine. I HATED wine I thought it was disgusting as did the rest of us. We opted to drink the wine and I can remember chugging it to get past the taste just so I could get drunk. Warning sign anyone? ..&amp;#x200B;..It was also around this time that a friend of mine was dating a guy from another school who I was also friends with through various clubs and competitive sports. He struggled with depression and anxiety and she broke up with him after his behavior really scared her one day. He continually reached out to me and asked to talk to her and asked what he could do to get her back every hour of every day. He had totally lost it and was freaking me out so when he called the next time (I'll never forget this) I screamed at him that I didn't want to talk to him and that he needed to get help. A week later he shot himself. The funeral was agonizing and the drama was intense. He had written dozens of journal entries on Myspace (really dating myself here) that basically blamed my friend and I for his suicide. ..&amp;#x200B;..That's when my drinking took a huge turn downhill. I was 17. ..&amp;#x200B;..I drank anything I could get my hands on. When I went to my friends' houses I stole their parents booze (unknown to my friend) so I could take it home and drink it. I'd drink alone in my room and tell my parents I was studying. I started stealing my dads pain pills and snorting them. I started experimenting with other drugs like weed and cocaine (side note I ended up getting addicted to cocaine but that's a story for a separate sub) I thought I was just partying and doing what every young adult does. All my friends were doing it? ..&amp;#x200B;..Then I got a fake ID and things got WAY worse and I began drinking daily. I was hoarding vodka bottles in my room that my parents found and grounded me for. They were too scared to really talk to me about it so we never did. Even when I ended up getting Psoriasis from drinking excessively we didn't talk about how I had a problem. In their mind I didn't have a problem if we didn't talk about it. ..&amp;#x200B;..In all of this I was engaging in seriously risky behavior that I'm not proud of and I have deep guilt over. Drinking and driving waking up in bed not knowing how I got home waking up in my car not knowing how I got there **drinking in my car while driving** drinking at work doing drugs at work drinking before my college classes. My boss even took me into her office one day to ask if I was  OK.  It was a very blurry conversation but somehow I didn't get fired. I dated terrible men (one who was 20 years older than me) convinced that was what I deserved. I routinely woke up with my own vomit all over me a wet bed and searing headaches. ..&amp;#x200B;..Then came what I still consider my rock bottom (even though I'd continue to drink for 11 more years) On July fourth 2007 while blackout drunk I drove my car through a brick wall hit another car and a fence and landed in a parking lot. I was 19. I miraculously escaped getting a DUI because the cops that responded were on motorcycles and we had to wait for a cruiser to pick me up. Given the holiday a cruiser couldn't respond for hours and by then I would have been sobered in booking so they let me go. I am so SO FUCKIN lucky that I didn't hurt anybody or myself and I still carry around the guilt of those actions around today. ..&amp;#x200B;..I put off drinking for a while after that and got transferred to a different location at my job. Slowly but surely I started drinking again - on the job - and that's when I realized I had a big problem. In an attempt at changing myself and finding some strength inside I shaved my head when I turned 21 ( am F) and vowed to quit drinking. I think it lasted about 6 months before I was back at it. This time though I would be safer I wouldn't drink and drive I tried really hard to moderate and I decided not to hide it. Still at my parents' house I'd bring home handles of whiskey and leave them on the counter. I thought for SURE they'd say something if they noticed the booze disappearing rather quickly but they never did.  ..&amp;#x200B;..Then I met my first boyfriend at 22. Spoiler alert-he's an alcoholic too! We were two peas in a pod and we encouraged each other to drink and convinced each other that we didn't have a problem even though I got a nagging feeling every time I heard recycling come each Sunday to pour out our garbage can full of bottles. I started hiding booze from him and drinking in secret so he wouldn't know how much I had really drank. We drank every day and still didn't think we had a problem. Our relationship was awful and emotionally abusive and I eventually broke up with him two years later. During that conversation he said to me  you know leaving me won't make you quit drinking.  Boy was he right! A week later on July 4th I drank a pint of vodka and landed myself in the hospital with acute pancreatitis at fuckin 24 years old. My ex showed up to the hospital and we got back together for another 2 years. ..&amp;#x200B;..I know we all hear this and we've probably all engaged in this theory but I still didn't see my drinking as a problem because I was getting A's in school I had an awesome career that I was kicking ass at I was traveling and my relationships with my friends and family were decent. Alcoholics don't do that right? WRONG Functioning alcoholics do. I literally put myself in the hospital because of my drinking had doctors tell me I could never drink again and I still drank every fucking day thinking I didn't have a problem. ..&amp;#x200B;..Now at 30 I have dedicated myself to fighting this. This year I have had 71 relapses and 71 Day Ones but I keep trying. I go to therapy I take anxiety medications and I just started seeing a doctor regularly. I'm on day one again and I have my first AA meeting tomorrow morning. ..&amp;#x200B;..The moral of this story is KEEP COMING BACK. I let my drinking get this bad because I never thought I could quit and I never tried. Now I'm finally trying and while I've fallen down a bunch of times I keep trying. I am not perfect recovery is not perfect but I know I am strong. I'm not proud of my past but I am hopeful for my future sober self and I can't wait to see what she does. I already know what she can do drunk it's amazing to think what she can do sober. ..&amp;#x200B;..I can't wait to come back to this sub and write a long post about how much my life has improved since I quit drinking. For now I'll check in daily engage with other posts and post my own entries. Thank you for reading this thank you for being here and thanks for being you. If you're on day one or a thousand and one please join me in saying I will not drink with you today.

Thanks for sharing your story! You are a really engaging writer I definitely relate to many parts of your story. The shameful recycling! I had forgotten about that. I am so proud of you for your resolve to keep trying. One day at a time is really all it takes. IWNDWYT! 
I was a high functioning alcoholic too until very recently took me multiple tries to get to my current streak which is the longest in 23/24 years of extremely heavy drinking. Stay   one minute one hour one day at a time! Quitting drinking will be the single best decision you will ever make in your life. Period. IWNDWYT
