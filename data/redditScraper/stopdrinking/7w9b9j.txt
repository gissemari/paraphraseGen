I'll start by saying I've definitely had my fair share of ugly blacked out moments whether it was a fun night getting away from me or I was drinking to drown something out.. or anything in between...But I'm now 31 and can't really say I've blacked out recently. Maybe 1.5 to 2 years ago pretty sauced take a cab home sort of thing. But to the point of my post... I have been a pretty steady 1-2 beers a day or maybe 5-10 a week kind of guy for several years and just recently Ive finally been trying to call it quits for the negative effects it seems to have on my mental health. .There are several things that have caused me to be depressed throughout my past few years and although I wasn't hitting the bottle to drown it out even just the 2-3 drinks for some release was preventing me from the clarity I need to finally get over the hurdles I've been struggling with.. and off of that merry go round of the same old self-pity shit...I'm grateful I don't have the desire to slam a whole bottle.. but I was lying to myself that just a couple of beers is ok. (For me at least) I go from a focused even keeled centered person with my priorities in line to just not giving a shit and slowly back sliding as opposed to making progress towards anything in life. That seems like enough for now.. but I'm just curious if anyone else is in this range? And has noticed how nuanced this drug is and much it can mess with your mind?

Yup
For some I guess a couple IS ok.  But if you've noticed it's causing issues with other areas of your life then for you it's not.  And that is OK!  Happy 5 days to both of us.
