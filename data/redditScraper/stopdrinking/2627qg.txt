So some pretty light stuff obviously. ..Today I have been sober for three weeks. In the past few days I have been thinking about some people I know who died in the past year from alcohol. ..The first was a girl I went to college with. I didn't know her well we had several mutual friends but we were never close. Last summer she fell off a golf cart at a wedding hit her head and died. I don't know the full details because I thought it was not appropriate to pry but apparently if she hadn't had so much alcohol in her system she would have lived. ..We were all big partiers in college as most people are and I feel like our lives continued on similar paths in the couple of years since we left. I have had several bike accidents while drinking and thankfully was wearing my helmet but it is terrifying to think that her story could (should) be mine. ..She was 25 when she died. The day she died was my 24th birthday. This year on the one year anniversary of her death I will turn 25 and I will have 76 days sober. ..The second person who has been on my mind was a close friend and co-worker of my boyfriend who took his own life in November. He was an alcoholic who had lived on the streets joined an inpatient program at the Salvation Army turned his life around and gone back into his field (architecture.)..He had years sober. I don't know how many somewhere between 5 and 10. He relapsed he couldn't get clean again and he hung himself drunk and alone in his apartment. They aren't sure of the date because he had isolated himself from his friends and family and they only went in to find the body when he started to smell. ..At his funeral I told his daughter how sorry I was for her loss how much I loved her father and then I went and got blackout drunk because I am an alcoholic. It is so fucked up. ..I am terrified that those stories could be mine. ..I don't really have any wisdom just having a really hard few days and feeling sad and scared. Maybe I feel guilty for being alive. ..I hope they are at peace.

There are a lot of ghosts in our sober stories.  We aren't them.  We choose to live and sometimes even honor the happy memories of our late funny and tragic friends.  I constantly quote my former business partner college philosophy instructor and sponsor-ee Carter who died of a heroic overdose.  Carter was a tragic figure but for some years he was astoundingly sober and insightful and I still keep his memory alive by quoting things he said.  Carter once told me:  Everybody learns from their mistakes that's no neat trick.  Smart people learn from other people's mistakes.  ..Bless the memory of our prematurely past friends and family.
