I figured this might help others as it use to really bother man when I would have to reset my number. I know the dates arent everything but I would go from 60 days back to zero 90 days back to zero hell I even had a year coin turn 3 weeks later to a 1 day coin. For those who have long stints send out some encouragement to those always restting

I've had so many day 1's for drinking and smoking. I can't even believe I've made it this long! Congrats to everyone who continues to try and have a better life  
Starting over is a new opportunity to write the next chapter of your life. 
More than I can count.
