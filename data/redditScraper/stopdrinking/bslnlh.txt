Are excitement/anxiety two sides of the same coin? ..Sorry for the backstory rehash but I want to put this question into context. Got sober at 20 and stayed that way for 3.5 years. Drank for 4 years(with several 4/6 month "dry" periods). Got sober again and stayed that way for 10 years. Drank for another 8 (again with many 4/6 month "dry" periods in there)...Sober again now but really trying to look at the patterns this time. The other periods of sobriety I just basically quit drinking (after a couple of month stint in AA at age 20) and went about my life. When I did relapse there was no big drama. I just decided I was "obviously" not addicted to alcohol and could drink...Wrong. Even though I only drank episodically (a weekend - parties holidays etc.) if i EVER took a first drink I would take MANY MANY drinks. This started from the very first drink I ever had. I drank to oblivion. Throughout my drinking I AlWAYS got drunk and almost always blacked out. Then I would not drink for months then eventually go to a party drink like a maniac black out then quit drinking until the cycle started again. I never drank alone or when I was sad or consciously anxious. Always just when I was excited about having fun...I think this is why I have thrown away so many years of sobriety. I was never able to convince myself that I was "addicted". But there is clearly something chemically wrong if I have never been able to stop at one drink even when I first started...And because I always start drinking in anticipation of a "fun" event (drinks with friends a party a holiday) I'm beginning to wonder if anxiety might be at the root of it? I get so excited about how much fun something is or going to be that I just go off the rails. Every. Single. Time...Does this ring true for anyone else?..I realize in the end it doesn't matter. I can't drink for whatever reason. But I'm just wondering if anyone has a similar pattern.

You are describing me so much it's not even funny. You have a binge drinking problem which is essentially a problem moderating...Anxiety is definitely part of it for me. Also just something in me wants to chase the high that goes with having fun...I hated having to stop after 1. I hated when people were drinking too slow. I hated being a guest at someone's place and not being offered more alcohol...This type of thinking isn't normal and it's how I know I have a problem.
If you read all the posts here on a daily  basis  you will find that your behavior  is quite  normal  here.
