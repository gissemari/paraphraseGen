Coming up on one month getting ready to go on vacation with my wife who is threaten to leave me or not even go on vacation if I get drunk again and yet I find myself plotting and planning. I just checked in and realized that it is almost like an election do you vote for moving forward or do you vote for falling backwards. It's also a binary decision yes or no on or off..There is no way to hide you're drinking. Even if I stayed out till 5 o'clock 7 hours from now I would still come home with a blurry eye bloodshot as well as the terrible feelings of lying and hiding and guilt. As well as not doing a damn thing in regard to my business so all of these things as I had them up I'm going to keep me from drinking today so all of these things as I add them up I going to keep me from drinking today..I'm posting these thoughts here today because I know this group understands the struggle.

Thank you for your story.  Lets not drink together today. I really like waking up sober. It is a result from the choice I made yesterday.
