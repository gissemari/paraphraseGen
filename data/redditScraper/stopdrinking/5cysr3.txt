Give this a listen. My wife found this song for me and it has helped immensely. My anxiety has been getting better and better since I quit drinking but I still get stressed/ anxious at times. Anyway apparently this has been scientifically proven to reduce anxiety up to 65%! I hope it works for others like it has for me. Stay strong everyone!..https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UfcAVejslrU

Here is the article if anyone is interested...http://www.inc.com/melanie-curtin/neuroscience-says-listening-to-this-one-song-reduces-anxiety-by-up-to-65-percent.html
Fascinating article thanks for the post! I never realized how bad my anxiety was until I quit drinking. The booze helped me relax or forget my problems I guess.
Thank you for this! I only saw the article briefly and then it required some sort of login to get in but thankfully you posted the link to the song separately. Thank you. I've been suffering from severe anxiety lately.
This is great thank you!
Thanks for sharing this! I will try this later.
