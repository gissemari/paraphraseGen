Hello sobernauts!..I'm fairly new to this sub closing in on two weeks (woo!) and I would like to share a few things that have been working for me. I still have my struggles but like you all are I'm fighting hard to overcome them. ..1.) I've taken up a couple **new hobbies**! I started watching tutorials on how to make knives. I've really been getting into the survival and bush craft scene. I had the day off from work today and saw my daughter off to school so I was alone. When about 9:00AM rolled around I was bored and you know what happens when you're bored. So I decided to take the plunge and make my own knife! That's what I spent the majority of my time doing today and I have to say during the entire process I was able to overcome temptation and completely forget about it. Hobbies are a great way to pass time and focus on something you're interested in. Not only that but the end result is extremely satisfying...2.) **Learn**! There's so much stuff out there to learn about. I've been utilizing down-time at home and at work lately to start studying for new certifications! There's so much free information about it out there on the web I wish I could learn it all!..3.) **Support**. I don't have a huge support group other than you guys and my wife. She's really awesome. Though most of **my support has come from SD**. Sometimes if I'm not occupying my time some other way I will come here and read all of your struggles and triumphs. I find that connection to help me quite a bit...4.) **Talking to people**. I told my boss what has been happening to me. It took a while for me to come to terms with my addiction and though I didn't *think* my work was being hindered I'm sure in some way it was. So I took it to my boss today who luckily is a good friend more than a boss and I let him know *everything*. Turns out he's been struggling too. He's on day 5 today and we decided to lean on each other for support. Not only that but if my friends have asked to go out or whatever I let them know I am fighting a battle to change my addiction. I'm blunt and they've been understanding...5.) **Candy! Food!** Yea. About that losing weight thing... I'm not worried about it right now. I'm feeding myself with candy and delicious food and it's been a huge help. I think there's a bit somewhere on the sidebar about it...6.) **Encouraging others and connecting with them**. There are a lot of people here starting out today just like I was. I find when I share my experiences and embarrassing moments with alcohol I make a connection and it eases the pain. ..7.) **One day at a time**. You'll see it all over the place here and it's a very true mantra (for lack of a better term). I'm trying to simplify revovery by putting one foot in front of the other. That's all we can do is live in the moment and at that moment I am not drinking. This small bit of advice has done wonders for me so far even in the most difficult times...8.) **Love yourself**. I messed up I know it. But I am here because I want to change. I like many of you  an making a very difficult decision. I am proud of myself...9.) **Now I'm just rambling**. Sorry just super happy. I got a lot on my plate right but becoming sober has allowed me to organize myself my actions my family my work all in a matter of days. Hopefully I have shed some light for some of you as well...Hey we've got this!..Edit: BOLD!..Edit 2: Wording!

Hey great post I am wondering if you could change some of the wording to speak from the I. That'd be swell :)
Good for you!  Cant wait till i get where you are.  Congrats on 11 days!!'
Good stuff keep it up!
Learning is a big one for me I have been taking on HVAC as a hobby because I have been ripped off by too many air conditioning repair guys in my life.  I have been taking courses.   So I have been buying the tools with my beer money and am working on getting certified.  AC repair is a racket because the customer doesn't know anything about it.   I have also been getting into wood working.  Its crazy how much time alcohol took.
