It's pretty sad. But every text convo I start with people. I 80% of the time get a  You been drinking?  Text immediately. Makes me really sad tbh. I just feel so ashamed. ..Today I went to the gym and worked out hard. Felt great. Went to class too. Then succumbed to my addiction for alcohol. Got desperate I have like $60 to my name. Used $20 of it on alcohol. I'm an alcoholic for sure. This battle though I'm going to fight hard. I'll still get up at 9am and goto the gym...Anyone who has been an alcoholic and overcome it what advice you have? How did you overcome this disease?

I can't count the times I've gone through the exact same thing as you.  A few days here a week there. Replacing one addiction with another doesn't work at least not at first.  7 weeks in I'm finally developing a steady routine for exercise proper eating habits and a weakening attraction to all things sugary. Initially though my whole addiction had to be NOT drinking. I did anything I could at the time to feel better. Smoke a cig or a bowl eat cookies and ice cream take a nap whenever... ..I'm lucky to have an understanding wife. It took probably a good 2-3 weeks of this before I started mellowing in terms of a desire to drink.  That feeling of walking next to an endless precipice does slowly dissipate. I'm hopeful for the day I can't see the edge anymore. ..Hang in there. One day at a time. IWNDWYT. 
There's a saying in AA "Give up the fight and pick up a white."..Their white chip is a sign of surrender to the fact that drinking has beaten me and it's time to quit battling alcohol in order to get serious about recovering from being addicted to it...My recovery was more about learning to stop trying to run the show. I needed to get educated by listening to others who were having success...Good luck and welcome back! There's nothing sad about turning your life around. It takes repeated tries for some of us including me..
