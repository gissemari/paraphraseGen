Was feeling suddenly down lost and overwhelmed with the desire to drink after what started out with a day full of gratitude...I tried my best to accept that drinking would have lead to disaster and the craving would not last...Now I have another thing to be thankful for.  ..Sweet dreams everyone.

It gets easier these NDV's will start adding up and that feeling and voice of obsession will become quiet. It has for me at least and has for others I know. 
Awesome job!! Rooting for you.
This sub taught me to check for HALT when I have a desire to drink - Hungry angry lonely tired. I went a step further and turned it into HALTH - Hungry angry lonely tired happy. The last time I relapsed I was happy content in love feeling really good and thought drinking would go so well with my state of happiness. It didn't go so well and it took me another 2 months to get to the dry shore. I now know happiness is a trigger for me as well.
Posting on here is a great way to bust up a craving like that. Bravo !.
days 40-50 seem to be like that.  It shall pass!  You are strong :)
Coming up to day 40 and worrying a little. I have a feeling those coming 10 days will be super tough to get to 50. ..Will be on here every day. Be strong and use the force!
