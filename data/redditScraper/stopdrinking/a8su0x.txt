I'm finding this week pretty tough for cravings which is fine but I've found it relatively easy up until this point so I'm a bit wary and eyeing myself suspiciously. I keep romanticising a glass of wine big time...Does anyone have a pearl of wisdom to share?

Try AA
My counselor in rehab always said play the movie through to the end meaning move past the romanticism and onto the what will eventually end up happening.
Journaling about what I'm feeling why I'm feeling it what the consequences willl be etc helps me immensely
