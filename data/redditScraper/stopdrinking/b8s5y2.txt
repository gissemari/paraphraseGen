My girlfriend has decided to give sobriety a try again. Last time I forced her into but you can guess how that went. I've been here a lot reading and realizing this is something she needs to do for herself when she's ready. Now that she is she is struggling with the whole self doubt and all that anxiety the first days bring. How can I best help her? What is she feeling? What's the best thing to say?

Buy her a shit ton of juice haha
Ask her if there is anything you can do for her. Ask her if she'd like to watch a movie with you. Ask her if she's hungry and if so what can you get for her. Ask her if she'd just like to sit and talk. She's fortunate to have you and based on my experience these first days (I'm in my first days too) I'm not always sure what exactly I want but support is always welcome. Tell her you are here for her and you believe in her.
First what you're asking and doing for her is awesome! Thank you for asking...From my most recent experience: Take it a moment and a day at a time. Be present have patience and listen. Don't mention past attempts or anything that has happened as a result of alcohol. Healing can and will come later but it takes a very long time. Try your best to help keep her busy. Don't pressure her into anything- like you said she needs to do this because she wants. She might be unsure about a lot of things so don't let it frustrate you and understand that the first few days can be an absolute whirlwind. ..Be there for her as much as you can man. She's lucky to have you there to support her. Good luck to BOTH of you! You two are always welcome here and I will not drink with either of you tonight! :)
