Hi All.  As I'm sure many of you can connect with alcohol has consumed a large portion of my life and I'm ready to finally rid myself of its hold. As I write this I can feel the struggle within me as I try to convince myself that what I have been doing for years is fine but I know it is not.  I'm tired of waking up ill. I'm tired of going through the day groggy and unfocused. I'm tired of convincing myself I will stop tomorrow. Today is the day I take my first step.
