I've been sober since new years. No relapses or cravings which is weird since I've been an alcoholic for 20 years. My alarm clock failed to go off this morning so I woke up 10 minutes late and jumped out of bed way too fast. I felt so groggy that my first thought was "not another hangover. How much did I have to drink"? Then I realized that I'm not hungover and felt really happy still groggy but happy. I actually giggled and rolled my eyes and my old habit! I will not be drinking with you today!
