I struggled with sleeping last night and woke up with what appears to be flu. The bad news is I can barely get out of bed so can't go to my Dad's. The good news is that there can't be temptation from my Dad's fridge which always has beer for me. .Silver linings eh?

Sorry to hear you have the flu! I was really sick a couple of Christmases ago and was home in bed for about 6 days... It was actually one of the best holidays I've had. I watched sick day movies and ate baked potatoes with lots of salt and butter.  And I was most definitely sober for the entire day (the entire illness!) I hope you find a way to enjoy your day... Not drinking with you today!
