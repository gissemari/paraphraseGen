I have a hard time in the summer.... all my friends are having nice glasses of wine and I want to join. Every morning I'm glad I didn't but it really bothers me I can't just let it go completely. Any advice?

I had to find a group of friends who do not drink at all and when I am with the ones that do it is far easier to resist the temptation.
For me bearing the physical addiction was so much easier than beating the psychological addiction.  For it was in that mental battle that I learned whether I truly wanted to quit.  Without that true inner desire quitting was torturous.
Do you drink anything while you're with them?  I find sparkly drinks help me and a nice glass. As long as I'm.actually drinking something it helps with the fomo.
I would cut out as much social media as possible if you can. Summer is filled with imaged of drinks and it really makes you feel like you're missing out.
