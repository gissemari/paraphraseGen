Hey everyone! I have a friend who is interested in recovery and is struggling to find Atheist/Agnostic resources in El Paso. Does anyone have any good leads? Thanks!
----------immediate responses--------

Many of us here on this sub are atheist or agnostic and have found support and recovery in AA. I am so grateful I gave it a chance because I have been able to look past the God talk and found an incredible program that's teaching me to be a nicer person. And I'm still an atheist :)
The only "God" that came up in the AA meetings I went to was saying the serenity prayer at the end.  There was no deity worship otherwise.  Even the AA literature says that god can be whatever you want it to and is not meant to be forced as the religious god.
Y'all I have talked to my friend extensively about AA and how it can be super atheist and agnostic friendly. I've talked to her about how I'm an agnostic who has found a lot of value in AA. I absolutely am encouraging her to attend AA but I'm wondering if anyone has any specific resources/meeting recommendations/SMART meetings/atheist-friendly therapists or treatment centers. I feel kind of like this is turning into a discussion about how atheism and AA can go hand in hand and I feel like we've rehashed that conversation A LOT. I just want to have some specific resources for her versus this turning into that conversation. I hope that makes sense/doesn't sound ungrateful for your help. I'm really not trying to be argumentative; I just want to have some concrete advice to give my friend especially as I am not local to her. Thank you so much for your help!
