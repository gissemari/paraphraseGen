Good morning fellow soberinos! How's this Wednesday treating you? I hope we're all over [this week's earlier disappointment](http://nocountryfornewnashville.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/groundhog.jpg)...Here in WuW we all share our struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations. It's a place to check in see how our /sd buds are doing and support each other in our sobriety...Regardless of everything else going on in our lives time has passed the earth has spun and here we are again at yet another hump day. [And we made it through the big day!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmlK6xodMLk) Let's discuss amongst ourselves.....**Triumph**: I am feeling so much more confident lately in so many different ways and I'm really enjoying how it's manifesting itself in my life. I'm taking some social and professional risks that are totally playing out in my favor and I'm noticing how little wins can really snowball and enable me to step into situations that would have seemed terrifying a few months ago. The fact that I've been able to stay sober for 191 days is such an amazing achievement to me. I'm loving how it's affecting almost every piece of my life. ..**Struggle**: I'm struggling with food this week. I've been so busy that I'm eating a bunch of crap and I'm recognizing that it feels shitty in my body and has a demonstrable effect on my performance at the gym my sleep and my mood. I'm probably drinking more caffeine than I ever have in my life and I don't like it. Hmmm...**General Chat**: Hey I've got an idea. I know it's still more than a week away but /stopdrinking [will you be my Valentine](http://ecdn.funzypics.com/grumpycatmemes/pics/26/Will-You-Be-My-Valentine-.jpg)?..Alright guys - it's all you! How are you going to spend this sober hump day?
----------immediate responses--------

YO. Work of course! And family :)
Fruits of recovery.  Big time.  .. Still on eastern time so 7:15 meeting is easy.  Then much beauty.   And joy.  
hey guys. time is flying...how is it wednesday again?..**triumph:** i'm down a pants size. :).**struggle:** trying to find balance and not overbook myself and exhaust myself. trying not to be scared of down time. .**general:** did you guys see the Taipei plane crash video on the front page? crazy and sad. 
**Triumph:** I had a great weekend hanging out with my sister and niece they don't live in the same city as I do so we don't do it very often. My sister told me that she has decided to start moderating her alcohol consumption. She's not as bad as I was but definitely has some alcoholic tendencies. She said so far it's going really well for her and that seeing me not drinking was a positive influence for her. Not to toot my own horn but it felt good to hear that. Being a positive influence on someone is new territory for me...**Struggle:** Every time I think I have this stupid cold beat it comes back for another round. It's really thrown a wrench into my workout regime but I'm trying to rest up and not be too hard on myself...**General Chat:** I have a party this Friday to go to and will likely be the only one not drinking and that's OK. This group of friends have been very supportive of me and I'm grateful that I still have enough in common with them that I can enjoy their company without alcohol.
###Triumph.I made it through a lifting plateau that really took the wind out of my sails last time I ran into it. Squatted 240 lbs 5x5. At my weight and height it's not a lot but it's mine and I did it and I'm happy about it...Also a work thing went well: I programmed an Android app that is being used in a very weird way and it killed the first time it was ever used. Just nailed it. And I'd never programmed an Android app before. And even though I learned to program with Java I'd never even done any big Java work since college so like 5 years ago...###Struggle.I've had to turn down an open invitation to go be a scumbag in the figurative hedonist ski chalet on the metaphorical slopes of character defect mountain. I can't get into detail other than to say that turning this down is 100% the right thing to do but still feels weird. Operating as I did from a place of fear has my lower self telling me that I deserve to be a scumbag because I don't deserve to hold myself in any kind of real esteem...Fortunately I've learned that a) I can feel any kind of way about a stimulus and still take any action in response to that stimulus *including no action at all* and b) I can want something not want to want it and definitely not need it all at the same time...###General Chat.Anyone good at Arabic calligraphy? I call "we're all gonna fuckin' make it" my Shahada and I realize that it would look kind of dope written in Arabic with a sword underneath it like the Saudi flag. Too weird? Probably too weird. Also I've found that "making it" does not really translate into any language I know. We'll reach our intentionally unspecified destination. Hard to convey.
**Triumph:** I am finally back in the swing of tracking my food and sticking with my macros and finally the scale is following suit and moving in the right direction.  I gave myself some time off to eat dark chocolate and delicious carbs but NO MORE.  GIVE ME ALL OF THE SPINACH...**Struggle**  I'm struggling with work. I am trying to be grateful but I heard about some raises that were given and I didn't get one and there doesn't seem to be any basis for it other than the people that whined loud enough got the money and those of us just doing our jobs and being pleasant didn't.  So that's very annoying to me.  Still trying to process it and figure out how and if I should approach the subject with my boos.  ..**General Chat:** I hit 5 months today.  I want to take money from savings and buy a $300 espresso maker but that's just ridiculous.  So I will go get a breve instead.
Triumph: Finished a huge report at work!.Struggle: I have five more reports waiting :(.General: Just checked my January budget and because of the no-alcohol less eating out etc. we had a surplus of $500. Plopped that into a vacation fund!
Great idea! .Triumph: I actually finally got up the nerve to go see my doctor about my depression/anxiety and am a few months into my medication regimen. I feel like finally getting some help rather than self-medicating with alcohol gave me the leg-up to actually try and get sober for good. .Struggle: My wife and I are in the process of buying a house on top of working full time and going to school half-time. High stress without the usual weekend drinking to blow off steam.
**Triumph** .I'm reading again before bed instead of crashing straight away currently reading The Alchemist and it's helping me to be more reflective...**Struggle**  Seem to be arguing more with SO he seems pissed off with sober me might be in my head?..**General Chat**.Got a race this weekend realizing how dumb it is to feel that I should have a beer at 9 in the morning after running x amount of miles just because it's offered. I usually take one and drink half before tossing it. Will be looking for a coffee place after hydrating.
Another great WuW report from Cakes!  Woo-hoo!..**Triumph**: Things are going great.  I'm working on trying to have a good balance between work home and play.  It's mostly going well...**Struggle**: Trying to fight off a cold right now.  Hopefully it's getting better...**General Chat**: [I choo choo choose you!](https://smugnation.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/i-choo-choo-choose-you.jpg)
triumph- I am handling my struggles much better than I would drunk?..struggles- My lil brother is getting out of the hospital today after attempting suicide. he had to leave as he has no insurance. I am terrified he will try it again. ALSO yesterday my entire department was taken into HR yesterday and told we had 2 months left as out department is being removed. ..general- weather! crazy right? 
**Triumph:** Things are good...**Struggle:** I am dealing with a low-grade cold. Scratchy sore throat thick sticky congestion tired but not totally wiped out. So are the kids. So is the wife...**Chat:** /u/cake_or_radish I will [totally be your valentine!](http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/044/f/d/kissing_camel_by_peg353-d4po915.jpg) in a platonic cyber kinda way.
Triumphs: Recognizing that my drinking stems from my untreated anxiety/ocd. Working on that yippee skip. I started writing in a journal for the first time in a decade. It is scary to open up the way I am and I keep thinking I want to burn what I've written because I really don't want it to ever be seen by anyone else...Struggles: I'm having a hard time opening up to my husband lately about my struggles. I'm ashamed and embarrassed and he's working six 10 hour days so he doesn't have the time to devote to my babbling. I understand but it's hard because he has always wanted to be my rock. He is of course but It's different these days...General discussion: I'm thrilled that the days are getting longer. The sun is shining today. I'm taking care of my houseplants again and started feeding the birds outside. It's been a long winter.
Triumph:  2 weeks into a new job. First job I've searched for sober interviewed for sober been hired for sober and began working... sober. ..Struggle:  I'm on the last day of a 9 day stretch at said new job and am struggling to eat well/enough and stay hydrated (in a hot kitchen) and failing miserably at it. I'm Tired and Hungry (but at least I'm not Angry or Lonely)..  And I haven't been to a meeting or visited SD enough the last 2 weeks. ..General: I'm off 3 days after tonight - very excited to get some time to fiddle around with my new hobby of knife making (just received a new bar of beautiful high carbon steel yesterday to work with) and get to the gym and a meeting. ..Also it's shocking even to someone like me who is certainly no stranger to the restaurant industry and the habits of its workers how many people I work with at this new job are either actively or passively involved in some form or other of sobriety - at least 2 guys are active AAers 2 more were drunks who quit 10 years-plus ago and one guy is on an ankle monitor from a second DUI who is struggling with outpatient treatment (and then there's me of course). ..When I was drinking I never noticed how many of my fellow cooks/chefs had worked hard to sober up - I only noticed the ones who drank like me. 
**Triumph:** I've been applying for a University that I plan to be going to in the fall. I only have a couple things left to do and I'm golden. I'm insanely excited. I also have my trip to Colorado next week! I've began to notice how much I doubt myself and how much I always have. It's made a huge impact on my decisions and my life. I never really thought about it much before. I'm actively trying to work on my confidence now. ..**Struggle:** Where I live we're experiencing a lot of snow and it's hella cold. It's been throwing off my mojo. I'm typically up by 9am everyday and ready to get shit done. The past 4 days I would literally not get out of bed if it wasn't for work. ..**General Chat:** Does anyone else love oatmeal as much as I do? 
I'm not drinking today!..Triumph: I spent a night with my friend because it was his birthday. He got drunk and started talking up this very attractive woman. I thought they were hitting it off but when he went to the bathroom to piss the alcohol out she gave me her number and then left the bar before he could come back.
**Triumph:** Been keeping up with my jogging routine all week woot woot!..**Struggle:** I'm a freelance photographer and a client disliked the work I delivered to them today. What's worse is that I knew the photos were crap; it was a shoot I allowed to get out of my control and I've been dreading delivering the results ever since the end of the shoot. ..Went for a jog in an attempt to melt away the stress but I'm still driving myself crazy thinking over it. There's nothing I can change but my brain refuses to move on. I keep mulling over the situation...**General Chat:** My butt hurts... I've been sitting on it for too long. (Yeah IDK couldn't think of anything else to say.)
Triumph: I have so much money in my bank account and I've lost 20 pounds without even trying. ...Struggle: I'm sick and missing work today. Luckily I've got more cash than I'm used to having. ...General chat: spending my sick day at home playing destiny. If anyone on the 360 wants to do some dailies or weeklies hit me up. GT is same as username.
