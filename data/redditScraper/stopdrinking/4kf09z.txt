I've read here that the relapse happens long before the actual drink. I think I'm at that point right now.

This is the time to execute the rescue plan.  For me that is playing the tape forward; if that doesn't do it then I distract myself with (fill in the blank:  music watch a movie play with the dog go for a walk read a book); and if that doesn't work then I phone a friend.  The final act is to document which thing worked and try to figure out what triggered the craving so I can be more prepared next time.   Good luck and I will not drink with you!
Ugh.  I hate that feeling and I know it well.  Lately when I start wandering down that road I try to bring it back to the simple things that worked for me in the first couple of weeks one day at a time try to take it easy on myself check basic HALT triggers etc...my experience has been that once cravings pass and they do pass it feels great to be on the other side.  Thanks for posting I've been struggling with this too lately.  
Way to go for sharing this! I've used a variety of tricks and that is I won't drink today but maybe I'll drink tomorrow. This sometimes works but it can be dangerous if a relapse is coming. Playing the tape forward helped me the most.
