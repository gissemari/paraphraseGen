*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*..**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**..I'm pledging myself to not drinking today and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others...It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours lets not drink alcohol!..This pledge is a statement of intent. Today we don't set out trying not to drink we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset! What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up...**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning...**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread...This post goes up at: US - Night/Early Morning Europe - Morning Asia and Australia - Evening/Night..A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar...> Henry Ford once made a wise remark to the effect that experience is the thing of supreme value is life. That is true only if one is willing to turn the past to good account. We grow by our willingness to face and rectify errors and convert them into assets. The alcoholic's past thus becomes the principal asset of the family and frequently it is almost the only one!..> This painful past may be of infinite value to other[s] still struggling with their problem. We think each [of us] which has been relieved owes something to those who have not and when the occasion requires each [of us] should be only too willing to bring former mistakes no matter how grievous out of their hiding places. Showing others who suffer how we were given help is the very thing which makes life seem so worth while to us now. Cling to the thought that [ .  . . ] the dark past is the greatest possession you have-the key to life and happiness for others. With it you can avert death and misery for them..P.124 *Alcoholics Anonymous*.

Good morning fellow Sobernauts!  Yesterday was really bad - all full of my tricky alcoholic brain reacting to triggers but I only drank my LaCroix and a good portion of my 24 pack of water.  I make my pledge again today - I will NOT drink alcohol no matter what happens good or bad.
I will not drink today.
Good morning.  Not drinking today.
I love the daily check in! Why? Because throughout the day I say to myself I gotta make it to 6 months. I gotta make it to a year. I gotta make it forever. That's taxing feels insurmountable and unachievable. Daily check in is amazing. It gives me a goal way less overwhelming and that seems way more achievable. 24 hours. That's it. I just have to say to myself I gotta make it today. Thank you for that. I can do this. I will not drink today!
I won't drink today!
Today will be a good day; I can feel it.  I won't drink today.
Yesterday was tough and I've got a sugar-hangover today but that won't alter my commitment to NOT DRINK for TODAY.
I am not going to drink today!
Tuesday sucked and I tried to convince myself to drink but I didn't..  Wednesday sucked and I tried to convince myself to drink but I didn't..  Now it's thursday.. I tired of every day sucking so much but I don't think drinking is a way to handle it. I will not drink today...*things suck because I keep running into my exgf who dumped me and the feelings of rejection keep being brought back to the surface.. man love sucks.
i will not drink today. 
I will not drink today I've already been for a walk.
A good morning to my posse on /u/stopdrinking. A beautiful morning and I will not drink with all my fellow sobernauts today.

I will not drink today even though my morning has already had a rocky start.  I thought my doctors appointment was at 8 but woke up at 0805 so risked around to get dressed and couldn't find the keys and halfway down the road I looked at my phone and it says my appointments at 10 so I just came back home. Now I'm not sure when I go at 10 if they're going to tell me I'm 2 hours late or not LOL but at least I'll have my teeth brushed
One week down.  Phew.  This weekend we're in the mid-70's Friday through Sunday and after several dreary weeks it's such a welcome change.  Plans already include going to the park with some friends and my son to toss around the football going for a hike and a couple of projects around the house that I've been putting off.  Excited!..I will not drink today!

Not drinking today!
Here is the text from the Touchstones book. ..The first skill needed for the Inner Game is called  letting it happen.  This means gradually building a trust in the innate ability of your body to learn and to perform... W. Timothy Gallwey..A strange and intriguing mystery confronts us in the Twelve Steps. We are mending our ways; we are becoming accountable; we are striving to do what is right yet we are learning to let go. This seems like a contradiction of logic but it leads us to a spiritual awakening...We are becoming like the accomplished tennis player who has practiced diligently to develop every detail of his skill. Yet when he is playing the game he cannot focus on control. He must get his ego out of the way and let himself go. It is in letting go that he rises to his highest level of fulfillment. Today we will do what we must. We can make the choices we are faced with. Then we allow ourselves to be carried along by our Higher Power to complete and fulfill the process...I will look for opportunities to let it happen today...Quoted from the Touchstones app. 
Good morning! Today I won't drink.
