Ok. New here and no alcohol for today! To be fair I have no problem not drinking when I'm working it's my days off that I really struggle with. Add into the equation my marriage of 17yrs ended on New years day. Feeling hopeful about the future and hoping that I don't resort to the bottle to handle what lies ahead. .Hope your all having a good day and happy New year to you all.
