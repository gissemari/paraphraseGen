I've drank nearly everyday for the last 15 years. Sometimes excessively but mostly just 4/5 pints a night. I stopped after my birthday for 50 days. In that time I went to gigs I'm dates saw friends I would normally piss it up with and several other activities I thought I'd never be able to do without booze. Then slowly but surely I fell off the wagon and have just slipped back into my old ways. I won't go into my tale of woe (we've all got them and you know the score) but I'm 100% ready to knock this shit on the head again. I've got too much to lose. I need my clear happy head back. Not sure why I'm coming out with all this it's just easier to vent to a community of strangers but who all know your struggle. All the best everyone. IWNDWYT.

Glad you're here!  Sober On !
I'm sure you will succeed friend when the time is right. Well done on wanting to stop the spiral of destruction. I Will Not Drink With You Tonight.
Welcome!  Alcohol was everything in my life and so walking away from that was a very scary idea.  But I am a big believer in attitude shaping reality.  I see it at work all the time.  Those who resist change struggle when change is forced upon them and those who accept it as a necessity and try to move forward with a positive attitude do better.  They learn the new technology faster.  They are better liked by those around them.  And that leads to even more success...So I try to do the same when change enters my life.  I can bitch and moan and fight by doing the bare minimum but things turn out better when I dive in with full force and positivity.
For me I had to think I could moderate twice before I decided to quit for good.  I understand one drink will lead to half a whiskey bottle in about 6 months time
