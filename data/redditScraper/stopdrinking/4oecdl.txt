This will be a quick post and I'll write a longer one soon but yesterday marked 2 years of sobriety for me.  ..I've lost 100 pounds started taking classes to shift careers began hosting SMART meetings and developed new hobbies.  The time has not been without struggles but in sobriety I'm able to make a plan and deal with issues as they arise.  ..SMART my family this sub have all been crucial in my journey.  Thank you all for your contributions and your desire to better yourselves.  I truly am proud to be part of this community.  ..Most importantly I'm beyond grateful for the opportunity to reclaim my life and find a new sense of purpose and direction.
