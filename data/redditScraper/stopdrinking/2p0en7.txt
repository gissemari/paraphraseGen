Well. I've finally gotten the willpower thanks to you guys. I may not be totally there but I'm giving it a shot. ..I've been on and off heavy drinking for 8 years now but as they say alcoholism is a creeping disease and for the first time I found myself at the bar saying "that's it for tonight" and couldn't stop. Cut to many "porcelain phone calls" "Jesus Christ Showers" and that dreaded shameover I've realized that this relapse may lead to many more terrifying things and thanks to the many wonderful people on this thread I'm realizing I don't need to escape from myself but love myself sober. ..I joined the gym today and also started writing three pages of gibberish every morning to try and exorcise the demons that point me to the nearest bar and the bottle. Right now I feel great but I'm fairly sure that stumbling blocks are coming...Sorry for the rant. Just wanted to say that it's been reading on this sub that's given me the strength to at least try. Thank you for that. ..Cheers..-C

Good update /u/Daddyissueswarbucks -- keep updating as you go along.
I've also been finding writing extremely therapeutic. ..Someday reading our words may keep us sober for a night...Stay strong.
Welcome! So glad you are here I am fairly new here too. But this place has changed me I feel safe here and I also don't feel alone  that there are "others like me". I hope you stay and take it day by day minute by minute. Feel free to pm me if you have any questions. ..Let's do this :)
