Evening /r/stopdrinking. I've been clean 5 days for what was otherwise months of heavy drinking. It's been going alright but everyday I struggle with the cravings. I'd drive myself to the bar if my car wasn't in the shop for a while and that kills me. How do you try and curb the cravings?

Cravings are temporary. Even if they hit you often they don't last for more than 15 minutes at a time. You just remind yourself that you have the power to withstand them. You're capabilities are deeper than you know. After a while you'll begin to appreciate just how awesome you can be. You've got this.
Morning dicerollingprogram. Good on you for getting to 5 days. Congress! There are lots of threads about this to be found on /r/stopdrinking. [One just posted a little bit before yours](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1rw281/tips_on_how_to_not_relapse/.compact). I wish I had more time to comment but I must get to work. Just remember that you are in the early stages of sobriety and you will have cravings. You are going to have to rewire your brain to focus on other things besides drinking. My best suggestion is start an exercise program. Exercise produces endorphins which your brain will start to crave instead. Call one of the people whose phone numbers you got. Continue to attend your support group AA. You can usually get a ride if you reach out to one of your contacts. Do something clean your bathroom. Anything. Just don't drink!

Dessert. I don't know if it's the best idea for you but it's better than drinking. I found that a part of my physical craving for alcohol was the sugar part so I'd go to my neighborhood bakery and treat myself to something decadent every night. Eventually the alcohol cravings will ease up then it'll be easier to ween yourself off sugar. Also wouldn't hurt to hit the gym too. 
I went to a lot of meetings.  I smoked a lot of cigarettes.  I posted on the internet a lot.  I ate a lot.  Basically I did whatever I wanted to the max.  Eventually the cravings went away. 
Sweets. Skittles. Snickers. Pie. Seriously. It helps.

I'm no expert but you know the concept of one day at a time? Well sometimes these days of ours need to be broken down even further. If I get cravings I start to break down the day I'm in into 1 or 2 hour increments. Plan planplan what you are doing and how you're going to do it. They are killers but they DO go away and if you have a plan in place  at least for me seems to really help. Break it down and keep it simple. " I'm going to clean the hall bathroom then start dinner in the next 45 minutes". Good luck you can do it!! 
Your brain is starving for a chemical you used to feed it. It's using every trick it can to get you to feed it again. Don't listen to it. The more you tell it "no!" the easier it gets... and then it shall pass. Willpower is a muscle that needs exercise like your physical muscles.
