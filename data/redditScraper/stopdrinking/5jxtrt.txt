Hi friends..I have done it. I've made it a week. Longest I've gone in YEARS...I can tell there's no turning back from here. Life is so much better sober..My face/stomach bloat is reducing I've dropped 3 pounds I'm eating healthy drinking tons of water (and La Croix ;) ) I'm feeling more confident talking to people and feeling more confident at work. ..I'm learning to deal with emotions rather than mask them..I did start Antabuse today as a JUST IN CASE! The real struggle comes on Christmas with my heavy-drinking family want to be prepared...Be well friends. I will not drink with you today.

Fantastic effort congrats!..Happy to be not drinking with you today.
Nice.  Really nice.  Getting through that first week is a real milestone to be proud of.  You and nobody but you earned it.
Congrats on 8 days... it only get's better trust me I was just there not too long ago. It's great waking up fresh and ready to take on a new day. Before I was literally living in the past... each day was spent recovering from the activities from the prior day... now I can plan and create my days and live for today and not in regret of yesterday. I will not drink with you today wish you the best.
