Feel super depressed after relapsing. Anyo else experience this?

For sure! It's one of the things that I use when I play the tape forward. The shame and also the depressant effect of the alcohol are a double whammy. Sending lots of good feelings your way!
Definitely! Depression anxiety and shame are all a common feeling for me and I don't want to do that to myself again. It is just not worth it. Get back on that wagon and be easy on yourself. The depression will go away with a sober mind. I will not drink with you today. 
Yes I feel depressed for several days. But it eventually goes away if I keep myself sober.
