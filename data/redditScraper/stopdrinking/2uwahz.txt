Stop playing the victim. We're not here to coddle you. We're here to help you get sober.
No one was hostile towards you. You were simply called out on your behavior. This passive aggressive post further underscores a complete unwillingness on your part to take responsibility for your actions.
This is yeahhh from chat-- I don't think there was any hostility. People were being hard on you but that's because /you need it/. You're stuck in a cycle and if nothing changes then....nothing changes. 
Early in many attempts at sobriety I also was pissed off at people for not recognising my unique and epic struggle perhaps with a parade or at least some cake...Chill out a bit no one is against you here.A few more months down the road of sobriety you will see another perspective than your current one a lot clearer.
Thanks everyone for your input.I'm to scared to go on chat anymore. Ive had a hard time before from people in my life.I now hate being drunk as is having the hangover i dont expect sympathy  so i apologize again for offending anyone
