During my time in and out of sobriety I've found out:..I'm allergic to eggs. Who would have thought? ..Beer really messes me up. More specifically messes my bowels up. I can actually 'handle' hard liquor physically fairly well. _bad_ discovery...It's really super duper easy to start drinking again and it's super fucking hard to stop drinking again...My life is screwed up and I need professional help to fix it. And professional help is available and it does actually help...I can change my life for the better. Even just the intention puts me in a better place than 90% of the population. Actual change - that comes when you're so pissed of with the way things are right now that you don't give a fuck who you piss of trying to fix things including yourself. (sorry for the language)...Most people are as screwed up as I am. We're all screwed up somehow. "Normal" people just don't exist. ..I can quit drinking. I've done it several times already more times than most people. Is it forever? I don't know. It's for now anyway.

Every day you don't drink is a victory. 
Good realizations. I think that the second to the last one (most people are as screwed up) was the biggest revelation to me. I spent a lot of time thinking I was the only one who felt the way that I did. It was a tremendous relief to find out there were whole swaths of the population just the same.
