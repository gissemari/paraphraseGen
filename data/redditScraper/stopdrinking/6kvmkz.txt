I was driving home from shopping today and realized that drinking was such hard work! Life is so much more pleasant when I'm not struggling with constant extreme exhaustion and pain...I will not drink with you today.

Yeah that's the thing people often don't appreciate when they are considering quitting. It is BETTER without alcohol. 
I know what you mean! I have gotten so much accomplished today thanks to not drinking life really is easier without a hangover! I wish I'd done this years ago!
Just think of all the money and time saved and the self respect gained!  I won't drink with you today.
