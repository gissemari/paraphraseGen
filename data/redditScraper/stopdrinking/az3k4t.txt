It's been a tough couple days. Relapsed twice this week alone. I've started going to AA I've been to two meetings so far gonna go to another two today. .I'll never tell my family about my alcoholism because they all warned me from an early age about addiction and they'll just say they told me so. And I'll be damned if they weren't right. So for now you guys and a group of anonymous people in my community are my support.

Me too.  I went to work Monday still drunk from Sunday and everyone could smell me and told my boss about my eccentric behavior.  If I wasn't extremely good at my job I would have been fired on the spot.  My boss told me this straight up.  I have no more chances.  Hang tough man I'm back at day 1 with you man.  
Just for today we'll do better. See you here tomorrow. 
My family warned me from early on too. When I finally realized they were right and started to seek help they were happy that I could finally see what they saw all along. Their support helped a lot.
Welcome back! I'm rooting for you and you can do this.
