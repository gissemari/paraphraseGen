For the past 5 weeks i have been on a bender drinking myself to sleep. For the last two weeks I have been struggling to go one day without drinking and resetting my badge. That day has come i have decided to become the best possible version of myself and that requires me to stop drinking. ..I am struggling from motivation but knowing I got through the first day makes it easier but it is still hard. ..I will not drink today!

You are awesome! That second day feels so good after trying many times over and over again and finally arriving there...I will join with you in not drinking today...How's the withdrawal going?
Nice job on the first step. Be proud and keep at it. What can you do today to not drink?..It's hard but it's the way to go to be your best self. That was one of my reasons too. A few days into this I see a lot of ways that I'm a fool and ways that I'm a good person too. Both perceptions are easier to work with now that I'm not drinking. ..I won't drink with you today.
I will not drink today in solidarity with you!!
Good!!Great.
