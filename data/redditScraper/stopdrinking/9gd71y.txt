Super long might be a rant. My bad but I want a drink and I will not give in so I'll type to y'all instead. I'm pretty sure I have a brand new 30 days since my last relapse but honestly I have lost track of the days. Work has been extraordinarily busy and lucrative allowing me to finally regain debt free financial freedom. Awesome I think to myself. Our bills are paid i'm sober the car is running well and the house doesn't leak or sag anywhere. My pregnant wife even came back for a couple weeks which made me feel human again. Like maybe I can actually live down the years of nonsense I put her through. No. I'm still not good enough. I thought fixing my behavior and continuing to provide a stable home for our child (I'm going to be a father! Its a girl!) would also fix my marriage. But now she says I'm too wound up about money and maintenance on the house and car. I probably buy more stock than I should but with the exception of my one hobby (indoor vegetable gardening) I am quite happy to live very frugally. The idea is to save now so I can retire early i'm aiming for hanging up my tool belt by my mid 40's. My wife has never worked and doesn't have to. Even though she left me she hasn't stopped using her card linked to our joint account which irks me but I refuse to let her suffer because i'm not so great of a person to be married to. At this point I don't know what to do she says the papers are being filed for divorce which tears my soul right into little pieces. I mean what a fuckaroo of a mess I made perhaps it is not something I can fix but I sure want to. The shittiest part of all is now that she has told me she wants a divorce all I can think about is booze which was the root cause of all our trouble in the first place.

Be proud of yourself. 30 days is an achievement. Your improved financials are an improvement. You're taking the right steps and doing what you need to do to move in the right direction. No matter how bleak it may seem right now with your wife it WILL get better. Despite the outcome of the marriage just keep doing you. Make your soon to be born child proud of you. Booze will only make things worse so stay strong. You're doing awesome. IWNDWYT
