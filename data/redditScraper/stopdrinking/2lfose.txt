This could be considered day one but I think of it more of day zero.  As I grow older I am not accomplishing as much as I would like to.   I feel that societal pressures to be social go out social drinking and the like are hindering my ability to grow internally as a person.  I've tossed about the idea of abstaining completely from alcohol and what change that would bring about in my life.  ..I feel alcohol is always the elephant in the room at social situations where it is present.  It's always looming over the situation.   Personally if i could do what I wanted I would avoid all events and situations with alcohol but that is counterproductive to the true issue.  ..I'm struggling to decide what I want to do.  Keep up the social drinking and the facade I feel it is or have enough confidence in myself to do what I want.  By this just not having alcohol so I can have more productive hours in a day week or month.  ..I want to be a better human and I feel part of that is going alcohol free. ..Thank you all for your advice commitment and embracing of all of us in need.

Alcohol isn't a moral or ethical issue. It's a substance. If you can't go without it you probably need to...There is no societal pressure. You do it to yourself.
No one cares truly cares if you drink or not at social events. I think us as alcoholics think if as an elephant in the room but not the *normal* people
I feel you on the pressure to drink. I still get it on the gold course or with certain guys at work after two years. "Come on just a few" is common. At the end of the day it is just a personal decision that you don't have to explain to anyone. It is over of the best things I have done in my life thus far and I recommend giving sobriety a short to see how it goes. Good luck.
&gt;alcohol is always the elephant in the room at social situations where it is present. It's always looming over the situation. ..I understand that feeling and I think it's largely self-imposed. ..I'm also older--over 50 family business and various social connections thereof--and my not drinking makes absolutely no difference that I can discern for any of them. In social situations I simply drink something non-alcoholic and others have whatever they're having. ..So for advice--try it. 30 60 90 days no alcohol. See how you feel. Assess the advantages and disadvantages and then decide what to do. Note whether it's hard or easy to stop for this period...Note that while not drinking you *may* feel stress anticipating situations in which there is alcohol but that feeling fades for many with time not drinking. 
I recommend checking out the Smart Recovery [Hierarchy of Values worksheet](http://www.smartrecovery.org/resources/library/Tools_and_Homework/Quick_Reference/HOV.pdf) and the [cost/benefit analysis](http://www.smartrecovery.org/resources/library/Tools_and_Homework/Quick_Reference/CBA_Worksheet.pdf). ..I actually still carry around my CBA worksheet and revise it every few weeks. It helped me a lot to put down my reasons for wanting to be sober and exercises like this really helped me formulate my thoughts and put together a plan. It sound like you've got the motivation to get started. Good luck!
