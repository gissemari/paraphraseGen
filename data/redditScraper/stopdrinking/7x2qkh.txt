Whenever you relapse. Do you ever clean your room or house the next day? Because it resembles the feeling of starting on a clean slate. Starting over. Giving it another go. ..I do that pretty much everytime I relapse. Makes me feel like I've collected myself and am ready to begin again. Is this a common thing?

I have an idea! Maybe keep the cleanliness to the same standard as when after you relapse. Take a day at a time. You will give it up for good! 
I haven't relapsed (thank God) but it sounds like something I would do once I recovered from the hangover...It's probably a subconscious thing in that you have complete control over the house and are able to clean it up perfectly and you wish you had the same level of control over your body/mind so you could clean it up whenever you wanted (i.e. rid the alcohol).  The cleaning of the house becomes a substitute for what you really want to do. Just a guess...I will not drink with you today.
I did the same thing.  I see it as trying to erase "evidence" of my bad behavior...
I definitely do that. And I always am reminded of the line from Jimi Hendrix "Wind cries Mary" where he goes .."A broom is drearily sweeping... Up the broken pieces from yesterday's life... "
