So I decided that at 21 years old that after drinking on average nearly a bottle of vodka a week for the past year that I need to stop and get a grip on reality. I don't wanna slip into alcoholic dementia like my dad drink and remember all the bitterness in my life and not choose not to change my outlook on life like my mom and to just not be a slave to alcoholism like so many of my family and friends have unfortunately done. I need to be aware and cautious of my family history and start acting now. I want to lose weight eventually stop smoking and have fun without alcohol having to release me to do so. .There are so many inspiring redditors on here that make me hopeful that after struggling since I was 17 with drinking that I really can help myself. This is the first night without a drink for a very long time and I am currently sipping on bubbly water with lime juice. I can't wait to start feeling better.

You are still young and you made the right choice! Alcohol can do so much damage to your body well you have experienced it first hand with your family. Picture yourself at one point being a dad or a good friend to anybody. If you are suffering from alcohol as much as you would witness at a later age you can never develop to become the person you want to be. You made the right choice! I will not drink with you today!
I love club soda and lime juice. Congratulations on day 1. I have quickly realized that the "fun" I had on alcohol was ruined by guilt and worry (about my health) and the fun I have when I'm sober is like being a kid again without dredging up remorseful feelings.
