Not from drinking. Had a row with my boyfriend that escalated into me angrily pushing all my things off my shelf and causing them to smash. I feel sick and regretful and angry with myself and confused... isn't this only supposed to happen while drinking? Is this relapse behavior? I thought I'd been dealing with my issues but this seems like a huge red flag that I've not been. I've been feeling really depressed and anxious since the start of the new year and yesterday was the first time i felt some relief from that feeling. I felt hyper on top of the world like i could finally buckle down and get all those things i needed to done. Then the argument the anger the sleeping in the heady sense of regret and disappointment. I haven't felt the urge to drink. I've just been so so angry. Anyone feel similar? Anyone have any advice? ****pain**** :( ..P.s I have apologised to my boyfriend and recognised that this wasn't an appropriate reaction to anything and will be seeking some kind of therapy asap.

Glad you're here.  Like you I don't consume alcohol.  I still have my "stuff" that I work on.  Seeing a counselor sounds great!  Good luck!
