.So I'm coming up on 6 months tomorrow which is incredible and something I though I was totally incapable of achieving. :)..I see so many posts about all the extra time and energy people have when they quit. I am taking concrete steps on the energy side with regular exercise lots of good sleep and slow diet changes. ..It's the time thing I can't seem to grasp. I don't seem to have more time. I got a planner to try to tackle this in 2016. But I'm feeling very stuck right now. I have made goals and put them in my planner for everything from organization to self care to family quality time to finances but.....I almost feel as if quitting drinking has catapulted me into a bit of a midlife crisis. My job which is highly stressful and demanding suddenly seems...meh. I'm having a real struggle conjuring up the same sense of urgency I felt for my work when I was drinking. And it has me questioning my line of work and life/career path. ..I don't know what I'm looking for...I guess does anyone relate or have any advice or suggestions? Is this just a normal shuffling of life priorities that occurs at this stage of sobriety?

&gt; Is this just a normal shuffling of life priorities that occurs at this stage of sobriety?..Probably. Hell I think that's just life. The bottle has a way of clouding things and it can take awhile to re-acclimate facing life directly. If you haven't read it I found [this book Man's Search for Meaning](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009U9S6FI/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&amp;btkr=1) to be invaluable. (It's by a psychologist who was in a concentration camp during WWII and how he was able to find meaning in his life even there.)..What I like most about sobering up has been that I actually have to face things in my life that I hid from for years. It's hard and occasionally terrifying but I feel like it's the only real reason to live in the first place and I'm thankful for the opportunity.
Not long ago I felt similar. I chose to revisit therapy. It helped me find some direction and led me a dream job. The antidepressant prescription didn't hurt either.
Well I know that when we remove the sedative some of the underlying issues can work their way to the surface. ..For me this is a good thing. I used to use alcohol to blind myself to my problems. Now they stare me right in the face and I have to recognize them call them by name and deal with them. 
Yep I'm in a similar place. I'm just trying to be gentle with myself and am committing to increased visits to the therapist to tackle those feelings head on. I sense these big deep quandaries take some time to work out. You're not alone.
