I suffer from Depression and OCD and at my last psyciatrist vist my doctor recomended Naltrexone which is generally used for opiate cravings but works for alchohal too. Has this worked for anyone else? I am not able to fight the urges to drink anymore or at least been struggling the last 2 weeks. Just curious as if anyone here has any experience with this?

There's a good Ted Talk about it: https://youtu.be/6EghiY_s2ts
I stopped drinking with Kratom. So that's something to consider as well...
It helped me a lot. It didn't make the urges go away but it did make them a lot less strong. Like more of a resistable want than a need. I combined it with Campral which also helps to reduce cravings (more subtly than naltrexone) and helps to reduce the anxiety and depression from quitting drinking..
I took naltrexone for a month (halved the pill) and it helped me tremendously to get over what I called the obsessive thoughts....I sort of just stopped thinking about wanting/needing to drink. As a chronic relapser it really helped me to put some time together! Good luck! Oh - I also do meetings and have a sponsor....for me - meds without that wouldn't have done much! Again - good luck! Keep us posted!
I took it for six months.  I didn't drink but I honestly don't know how much of that I can contribute to Naltrexone.  I had no side effects though so it certainly didn't hurt either.
