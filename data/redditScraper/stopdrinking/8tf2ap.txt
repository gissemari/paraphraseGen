I have a problem. I admit it moreso now than I ever have. I used to say it as a joke albeit a darkly cynical one. I'm not the type that struggles going a day without a drink but the type that has trouble controlling myself. I tell myself I'm going to go out for a few and then wake up the next morning with no recollection of anything...I drank extremely heavily in college but was functional enough to graduate in four years and hold down jobs. I never went through academic probation or any of that shit and never got arrested either. But I embarrassed and made an ass out of myself a ton. ..The alcohol lifestyle appealed to me because I suffer from social anxiety and a mild depression and it helped me to come out of my shell a bit. I thought it'd help me talk to people more but it turned into a slippery slope of me becoming a mess. I graduated a month ago and moved a long way away determined to start over. But here I am still doing the same shameless shit. My new roommates frequent the bars and I go with them but struggle with pacing. Last night I blacked out and made an embarrassment out of myself. I am deathly phobic of embarrassing myself further plus my drinking has worsened my anxiety problems over the years. ..I wish I could drink moderately with my friends but it's getting to the point where it's either no booze or full-on blackout. So I think I should quit for a while at least the best method of controlling myself is kicking it completely. I never hit a rock bottom like drunk driving or getting arrested but I would like to stop digging. ..So IWNDWYT.

Kind of in that same hole....not nearly as deep. But good on you for getting it out there...all the power to you!
'Rock bottom' is wherever you choose to stop digging as the saying goes.....Your drinking history sounds a lot like mine.....If you look at some of the [past posts about moderation](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=moderation&amp;restrict_sr=on) you'll see that most who have tried it find that it simply *doesn't work*.....Alcohol is a substance which is inherently hard to moderate for many of us because of what it *does* when it interacts with the brain... It's much easier to stick to 'none'! ..About 10-15% of the population has an addictive nature - we lack the ability to handle mood-altering substances like drugs and alcohol responsibly because of the way our brains are wired.....It's either all or nothing - there's no such thing as 'Just One'.....I found the book '*Alcohol Explained*' and the book/YouTube '*This Naked Mind*' really helpful for understanding my drinking problem and permanently changing the way I view alcohol - they are well worth a look.....Keep us posted!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
