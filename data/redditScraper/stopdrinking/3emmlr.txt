Today I celebrate my 6th month of sobriety the most sobriety I have ever achieved. This is coming from the person who use to fret about not drinking on antibiotics for two weeks wondering how I could do *two weeks* without a drink and then decided to drink anyway. This comes from the person whose personal non-drinking record was 6 days and decided to have wine to celebrate the achievement. This comes from the person whose family has spent $60000 on rehab five years ago and relapsed within a month. I've pee'd in all the beds got all the lawyers and the cab drivers knew me on a first name basis. I am a bad alcoholic but I know now I am not a bad person. That's the difference. ..This comes from the person who *hated* AA and swore never to go back. ..How'd I do it? Complete abandon. Surrender. Acceptance. Willingness. Honesty. Willingness again. ..I wanted to be sober and I was willing to do whatever it took to get sober. For me I could not have done without the Fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous or /r/stopdrinking. Thank you all you have helped me immeasurably...Since I have been sober:..1. Regained trust and pride from family members I have burned repeatedly..2. Drastically improved relationship with my boyfriend. .3. Went to the International AA convention (holla Atlanta!).4. Told the truth with ease..5. 182 hang-over free mornings. .6. Learned self love one slice at a time. ..I can say that this has been the most difficult self-seeking process I have ever attempted but it is worth it. It hasn't always been freckles and clovers **it's been difficult**-- especially in early sobriety. Be kind to yourself. ..Just for today one day at a time. ..[Here's my first post on day one to SD](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2tujmm/after_four_years_out_i_am_back_in/)
