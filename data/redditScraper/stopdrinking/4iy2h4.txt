I quit drinking last year because i started getting kidney pains psoriasis and a chest infection was spending around $500 a month i quit for about 9 months quit smoking for 2 saved up enough for a down deposit on a mortgage but i had a financial fling with my mom I basically threatened to start drinking again if she didn't pay me back my 17k i wanted to use for a bigger down payment she's been holding it from me since a settlement was a stupid blackmail that went nowhere. But i binged for 2 days and quit again for 2 months started smoking again when i helped a friend move n even refused a beer but i'm not in the same mindset as before this binge lasted 5 days my kidney pains came back my chest infection n phlegm is back and i cant help but think that if my mom just sent my money I'd still be sober n smoke free i was doing so good motivated with an approved mortgage and seeing apartments with my realtor now i haven't been looking for a place at all or even cleaning up just lying in bed all day. I'm still motivated to quit just feel like my family is holding me back my mom and grandpa both owe me money and its a toxic environment for me here.

Both of those things allow you to cope with your shit situation. So think of it this way- you hate where you are at and want to do better but you won't be able to if you maintain the drinking and smoking. ....You get upset and drink to not give a fuck. Substitute drinking with something else that will help you cope. This is why exercise is HUGE with people in recovery. 
I can always find a reason to drink.
