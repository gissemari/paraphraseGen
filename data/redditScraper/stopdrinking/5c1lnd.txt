Hi everyone.  I just needed to check in and make a post today selfishly just to get some words out to someone.  I'm struggling almost every waking moment right now with loneliness and thoughts of what could have been.  I realize it's an exercise in futility but I can't turn off the tap of emotions.  .  My only relief from the heartache of my girlfriend leaving me has been sleep but as soon as I wake up it's all I can think about.  My job has been tremendously stressful recently and this Friday is going to be a very challenging with a huge order that I'm in charge of.  I don't know how much of these emotions are being compounded by the fact that I've quit drinking.  I don't know when I'll feel "okay" again.  Right now it just feels like it will never come. I do know that drinking myself to sleep will solve nothing.  I will not drink with you today. I'm just so lonely.  Thanks for listening.

Hey you are doing so well! Keep going. If this gives you comfort I'm feeling the same I broke up with my ex as he kept drinking &amp; other things. Totally heartbroken &amp; have given up on love. Had interview yesterday but nothing feels good anymore. But I still won't drink &amp; you are not alone!..I'm sure things will go well Friday just don't pick up that first drink. Lets do this together  
You will definitely do much better tackling your challenge on Friday with a clear head good work sticking with it!  I keep hearing the first week is the worst hopefully your emotions will be easier to manage as you get further from your last drink.  Maybe you can win your girlfriend back or maybe the lessons you learned from that experience will lead you to be more successful in your next relationship.  I know heart ache is the worst kind of pain but time heals all wounds.  Virtual hug I will not drink with you today.
