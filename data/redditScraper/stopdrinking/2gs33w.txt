I wanted to say thank you to everyone who's been posting over the last week...I haven't been participating (I know I know I should) but I've been reading a ton of posts. It's been helping me a lot...I have to say not waking up hungover every day is a pretty fantastic feeling. But I'm still depressed and still struggling a lot. The only thing that has kept me going the past three days or so is the fact that I'm also sick and tired of being fat and drinking again will destroy this diet I've been so good on. ..Anyways I won't be drinking today. But I wish I was like some of the other people on this sub who just automatically start feeling better. At this point I don't know if it's possible for me to feel better.

You aren't alone: http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2gl28e/first_week_easy_second_is_killing_me/..Yesterday was a lot better for me (day 9). Today is going great so far. I'm sure I'll have some rough days ahead soon but just know that you will have relief soon!
Congrats on one week and hang in there the early days are not easy for most people.
Congrats on getting your first sober week!
I'm on my third week and I still struggle.  I still have issues with foggy brain oversleeping/not-sleeping.  ..To be honest I know I'm doing the right thing.  I don't expect a huge transformation in a short time.  But being sober has helped be prioritize my personal priorities.  ..Congrats on the week!  No one can take that way from you and that's a huge huge step - First week is the hardest.
Congrats on your week sober! :)..I'm in a similar situation as you and while being sober hasn't suddenly cured me from being depressed or struggling I do feel far more capable facing these things while sober.
