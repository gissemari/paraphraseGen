Well I've made it 600 days with your guys' help and many other positive facets of life. I knew this day was approaching as did my subconscious. I guess it would only be appropriate for me to have one of my now more uncommon relapse dreams  the night before this milestone. Scared the shit out of me when I woke up but I'm so thankful right now...all I can say is that as long is the fight is within you anything is possible. Once that desire to fight burns out be prepared for anything. I thank you guys as always. And here is my obligatory I will not drink today.

Congrats on 600!  I'm right behind you.  I had a dream involving alcohol last night too but it was one where I was out with someone and thought to myself "I wonder if he knows I don't drink?"  *That* was different!
