https://i.imgur.com/BqOTNcw.jpg..This is what I ended up with.   I hope a colorful Christmas tree recognizing the many struggles of so many people impacted by cancer on the cancer floor of the hospital will bring some joy to someone. ..Many times in November people start posting daily things on Facebook they are thankful for. Instead of just some internet post I suggest you try to practice a random act of kindness. It makes a difference...not only to the person who received the kindness but how you may feel about yourself.   ..As an alcoholic I came to recovery carrying a huge backpack of guilt shame and self loathing.  For me working with as therapist and working a 12 step program has lightened my baggage.  In addition as part of my journey to build self esteem doing charity and service work doing random acts of kindness and helping others has genuinely helped me change how I feel about myself.  ..So as the holiday seasons approach I suggest trying random acts of kindness.  Gratitude is an ACTION word...Stay sober my friends. ..Mouse..************************..Edit:  Someone asked me about the meanings of the ribbons.  Not everyone realizes how many cancer awareness ribbon colors there are out there...and they are definitely not all pink.  ..Many ribbon colors have multiple meanings..but most of the ones I made for the hospital are specifically cancers as it will be on the hospital floor specifically for cancer patients. And this is NOT a complete sample of the colors of ribbons I made I already took a box to the hospital so I'm missing a few colors I made...From left to right:..Red: Addiction/Substance Abuse awareness. (Red also symbolizes heart disease and a number of other causes..but I included these because of my alcoholism journey throughout this time)..Orange: Leukemia..Yellow: Bone cancer..Lime Green: Lymphoma..Pale blue: Prostate Cancer..Teal: Ovarian Cancer..Dark blue: Colon Cancer..Pink: Breast Cancer..Plum: For Caregivers of those with cancer..Lavender: Testicular Cancer..White: Lung Cancer..Missing in this picture but included in the tons of ribbons we made are: Burgundy (Multiple Myeloma) Gold (All childhood cancers) Black (Melanoma) Periwinkle (Stomach Cancer) and a few others I can't remember...
