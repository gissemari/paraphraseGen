Hi again.  I'm on day 7 after sleeping approximately 36 hours straight with a couple of bathroom breaks...This whole week I haven't been able to believe how awake I've felt even when I've been sleepy if that makes sense.  I have problems getting to sleep at night which is actually what started/led to my nightly drinking too much...A few months ago I admitted to my new primary care physician that I drank too much though I didn't say how much.  When asked why I was able to tell him it was primarily to allow me to fall asleep.  He asked if I'd ever tried any other pharmaceutical methods and when I said no he gave me a prescription for Trazadone.  I hadn't tried it until the beginning of this quit.  (Is that a noun?  It is now.)  I'm positive it's helped.  The first night I didn't drink I thought my chest was going to implode from the anxiety about falling asleep.  Then I remembered the Trazadone and that it's also prescribed for anxiety.  I haven't taken it every night but the nights that I haven't it's been calming to know it's there...All this to say another night down.  I know others say "I will not drink today."  That's never been a struggle for me.  For me that's easy.  It's after 7 p.m. that I have to make an effort.  So I will not drink tonight.  ..Realization:  My lifelong extreme fear of the dark was the main cause of my *beginning* to drink nightly but certainly not the entire reason for continuing...Thanks for listening.

Trazodone is also an older generation antidepressant. Hope it works well for you! Also interesting realization at the end there have you thought about therapy? I have a couple of (I think very unusual) fears that sprang up in childhood that I addressed with the help of a therapist. Best wishes!
