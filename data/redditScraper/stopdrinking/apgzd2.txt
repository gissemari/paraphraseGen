Survived another weekend without drinking (Pretty easily I might add). It seems as the time is passing it is getting progressively easier however I can see how complacency can become an issue on this journey. The only night I had a real issue with cravings was Friday because I was going to visit an Aunt of mine who is a heavy drinker. Thankful by an act of fate she is going through a spell of sobriety herself which reaffirmed my decision. ..As per the title I had a pretty bizarre dream/nightmare. (Funny thing is I actually dream again) There wasn't anything particularly strange about this dream to make it seem surreal. I think it was the emotions I felt what made it stand out quite a bit. ..I was in my father's backyard in his garden with him back in NY in the middle of what must have been summer. He offered me a Miller Lite (It's what my father's side of the family drinks religiously). I grabbed the can from him gladly and chugged half of it right out the gate. The feeling of the situation was everything was right in the world. Like I was back in the company of old friends and family and nothing was wrong in life. Suddenly a sense of horror and shame came over when I had realized what I had done and I poured out the rest of the can. I felt ashamed I had relapsed. I also felt an overwhelming sense of guilt I could not enjoy the beer with my father. ..I woke up happy it was only a dream. But with the slight sense of sadness I can never enjoy a beer with my dad again. (One of our past times). I guess there are trade offs to sobriety however I still don't want to ever drink again because the damages outweigh the benefits drastically...I guess this is just another part of the process

Thank you for sharing your story. I Will not drink with you today kind regards Invincie
I am having nightly full Technicolor dreams. Someone at gym told me that means I am in REM sleep which is good and which I wasn't getting while drinking.
