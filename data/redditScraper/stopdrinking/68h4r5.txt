Tl;Dr - Light bulb moment. Ended up in the same park as I was 6 years ago. It has been a good long reflecting day...When I went to upload these photo's on my computer I came across the "this day in history" on my fb. Man do I hate that damn thing.... abusive exhusband? Here's a photo! Lost your dogs in a divorce? Look when they were puppies!... hate it but today I am thankful for it. [6 years ago](http://imgur.com/a/U7ZQs) I was doing a charity walk (March of Dimes) for a fortune 500 company. I was in school I had my own apartment I had friends decently close to family rode a motorcycle that I bought on my own took care of myself..... worked 5 jobs while going to college but I made shit happen. Then 3 year ago I posted a video of wanted to do a spartan race.... I got drunk - well stayed drunk - instead..... for years. YEARS!!! *the race photo is from the past Feb. I finally fucking did it!*..Today has been a good day thus far. I went [canoeing](http://imgur.com/a/F6frC) this morning!! I have been in Florida for 6 months and I live on that canal leading to a beautiful huge lake but I have not one time been out there since I have been back.  I quit drinking for many reasons one of which is that I wasn't living anymore - I was just existing & although I was sober all that time I wasn't living - no wonder I relapsed. Nothing changes if nothing changes & I need to change everything and stop half assing it...Today I also got out of my house (with my momma because I haven't earned enough trust back yet to go out alone - understandable) and went to the [farmers market](http://imgur.com/a/DrACh) - back to the lake I was at the other day.  Look at all those sober people having fun! Yes that was a lot of photos but I just got so excited and so inspired. These people are taking their hobbies and turning them into something good & productive I have hope that I will not be broke forever lol - not that I plan on opening up a tent but that just prove anything is possible. ..So while I was there I found [this amazing table.](http://imgur.com/a/DrACh) You grab a piece of paper and put anything on it - a confession something inspirational a quote encouragement philosophy. Then you fold it up and stick it in the jar and take a piece of paper out. The one I plucked says **"Dear stranger Life is short enjoy every moment be thankful for every day :) Have a wonderful day!"** ( # perfect stranger project). Well hot damn did that just completely describe what I am trying to do - practicing gratitude when I wake up and before bed & trying to take advantage of not being sick & tired or drunk....I am incredibly happy that I went today and that I got out on that lake. I was sooooo happy 6 years ago (and I prob drank too much then too it wasn't a career yet hindsight 20/20 though right). I ended up in the same friggin park 6 years later and sober &&&& prob just as happy on both days :) I am grateful to have you fellow sobernauts in my life this subreddit has been a game changer in my life & I appreciate all the experiences shared on here and encouragement/inspiration you all bring to the wagon...[High Five](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg) ..PS. Thinking [this](http://imgur.com/a/U7ZQs) is a pretty good thing to remember too...

.Hi Red! ..I'm midway through what looks to be a really good Sunday! ..My chess is getting better I'm reading a ton and about to do some soon when I package up a couple things I'm doing today. ..I do agree with the hollow "counting only days" - sure the early ones weu're just glad we hid our heads under a pillow to skip the cocktails but at some point yeah I for one def do think it needs to be a holistic change. ..And I luv words! So a joke I luv is the "Teal Deer"! ..
Sounds like a fun day. ..But is no one going to ask this CAKE IN A JAR?   
Great story Red! I looooove canoeing too! Too bad I live in Arizona and can't do much of it. I could go up north and rent one but... who has time lol But I loved going with my Dad as a kid in Minnesota :) :)..It sounds like you are enjoying the sober journey so far! I am too. I had a weird funk the past two months but am pulling out of it. Overall sober life is awesome &lt;3 ..
Hey Red! I want you to know that because we are on similar timelines (you're a bit ahead) and because you're active on this board I look for you most days and am always grateful when I see your badge hasn't been reset. Your strength gives me strength. Not to add pressure to your life but it would really bum me out if I came here and you were back to Day 1. I hope you feel the same! I want you and me to be the old timers here with over 365 days come next May. You in?
