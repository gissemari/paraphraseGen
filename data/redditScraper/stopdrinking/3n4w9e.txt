.. Over a drinking dream. It felt quite real lol. ..Nothing motivates me to keep going quite like the shame and regret I feel during a relapse dream or the relief upon realizing it wasn't real!

Those are so messed up! I haven't had one in months but then I did last week and it really messed up my head! I was very happy to wake up and realize it had just been a dream.
In the past 11 days I've had both a drinking dream and a one of those dreams where I forgot to go to a class for a whole semester of college. Them shit aint cool. 
I haven't had one in a while probably four months.  But I remember thinking "What am I doing?" while putting the drink to my lips in the dream..Also regarding your username are you a First Aid Kit fan?
I'm on day two. Last night I had a drinking dream. Woke up ashamed I couldn't even last one night... The dream was wrong. 
I woke up on the couch one morning after just staying up too late and being exhausted. This was something that happened on a regular basis when I was blackout drunk. When I woke up I thought for sure that I had drank! It felt so real! I woke up terrified and disappointed in myself!!! I'm so so glad that it was not reality!!
