What is your go to way of celebrating when you get good news now that alcohol is no longer in your life?  .  ..  .I just bought a car today and I am feeling really happy because my life is finally coming together. My boyfriend and I went to school together and it has been a rough 4 years. He started a year before me and graduated last June and I am going to be graduating this June. I feel like success is so close that I can taste it.   .   .  .Anyways after being dirt poor stressed out and scrambling since 2014 it's a great feeling to now have two cars completely paid for in full. It doesn't seem like much to some but for me this is almost like my very first adult like accomplishment. Comparing myself to last year to where I am now it's insane to me and brings tears to my eyes seeing how hard we have worked and many struggles we have been through.   .   .  .Like I have said in previous posts I have issues with drinking when I am stressed out depressed or feeling anxious. I always turned to the easy way out and would drink until I felt better. Now I know that me being successful depends on me being sober. I for a while was trying to become successful with two hands tied behind my back when drinking. I mean it worked for a while but who knows how much longer I could have handled my s*** for.    .     .  .Not to mention I use a ton of math in the career path that I go down. One thing I have learned is that hangovers and going to take a math test in the wee hours of the morning do not go together.   .  .  .So I buy a car today and it feels great. I instantly get the biggest urge in the world to go to the liquor store and buy fun drinks to celebrate with and the urge is big. I have talked myself out of it already but IDK it just sucks when your mind has already made up it's mind that drinking will be the most fun activity to celebrate with.  My mind also purposefully will "forget" about the hangover that'll come tomorrow and how my 8 previous days sober will all be for nothing or that I will probably continue to drink in the future if I choose to drink this time... The scary part is somewhere in my brain it consciously chooses not to recognize these things. It deliberately doesn't think about them. I have no trust in the way my brain has reprogrammed itself I guess. It is funny because I swear I sound like a broken record but I NEED to stay focused and to think not do.  .  .  .I am going to cook a nice healthy dinner and go on a long run with my dog and boy friend. What things do you guys do that makes you feel good other than drinking? Also thank you for listening. You guys are awesome. Good luck to anyone who is thinking about quitting drinking and awesome job towards anyone who is already working towards it. :) &lt;3 I will not drink with you today!!!!

Know what's crazy? I bought a new car 78 days ago which was my last slip. It was so unexpectedly exhilarating that I was completely unprepared. If I did it now I'd plan to go to a byob place with my husband but we'd bring our own seltzer. ..The notion of alcohol to celebrate is deeply ingrained in me and frankly I don't know how to answer your question. I've had some fabulous news since getting sober but I was too skittish to celebrate it at all. ..What about flowers? 
I would probably go to a fancy restaurant and resist the wine (I've found ordering a hot drink as soon as I sit down has been good). After that I would be golden and stuff my face! ..Food is a good idea I think your brain is seeking pleasure as a reward is all it doesn't really care what kind it's just used to alcohol...Good for you for thinking this through!
