2 years today suckas. .For anyone on the fence or still struggling my life is better in so many ways and yours will be too...Financially: I make pretty good money (it's never enough right?) but at the end of every month I was totally broke. I am now actively building my nest egg and starting to learn how to make my money work for me instead of the other way around. ..Spiritually: My values started to appear. It pays to think and act hard on your values in life once you are able to discover them...Physically: My workouts are actually productive. I very quickly dropped a bunch of fat and put on muscle. (I didn't gain or lose any weight.) My sleep is awesome. Sex is better...Mentally: Life's challenges are not as great anymore. Focus is easier to obtain. ..Emotionally: I'm no longer angry/raging half the time. (Got it down to like 5% of the time:) ) I don't always feel like my emotions are whipsawing...Anyway keep at it!!! It's 100% worth it...p.s. Not an April Fools' joke!.

Congratulations and I've added you to /r/dinos apparently having missed your 1-Year anniversary.

do you come here now just to help others and share or do you have any problems staying sober at this point?
Congrats! 
Awesome.  ...Love the word whipsaw. 
AWESOME! I happened to click on the "1 year ago" history link earlier today [and saw you right at the top.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?sort=top&amp;q=timestamp%3A1396324800..1396411199&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;syntax=cloudsearch&amp;limit=200)   ..You've become an SD April 1 tradition!  ..No pressure.
