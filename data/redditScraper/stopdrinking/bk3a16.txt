I had a really great two-plus months until I snapped a couple of weeks ago and started drinking again. Fast forward to tonight: I've totally bottomed out again. No real regard for how much I was drinking until my fourth drink. Don't really feel like doing anything or missing my wife who is out of town tonight.  Just total meh... and then I just dumped the bottle down the drain. It's the third time I've dumped the back end of a bottle out in the last couple of weeks. I am cutting myself off better than before but it's a rinse repeat with the first few drinks and stupid to waste the alcohol like this. I need to stop this funk. Does anyone have any techniques they use to cut off the first drink from happening?

AA is my technique
Same. I relapsed and drank 13 bottles of wine in five days. Poured out the end of one the other day. My fingers are so weak I can barely type and a toe has gone numb and I'm getting these weird brain zaps. Got in touch with someone from aa for support. Just can't do it alone.
