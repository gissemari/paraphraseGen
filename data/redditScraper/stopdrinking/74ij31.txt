Amazing list!!! Thank you for posting!
See how all the benefits of drinking are short term? It helps tonight but not past those few hours. And with most of the costs further in the future it's easy to discount them in the moment...The CBA is one of my favorite tools. It's an excellent exercise both in the moment like you're using and for long term motivation.
I slipped up two weeks ago. I was focused on those potential benefits. I fully anticipated enjoying myself and dealing with the consequences later. The first few sips were like covering myself with a warm blanket and sitting by a fire on a cold cold day. It didn't last. By drink 2 I wasn't feeling good but I was on a mission. By the end of the night I was curled up in a ball on the couch crying. The benefits only looked that way from the outside. Maybe I used to be a person who could drink without trying to fill some depressive hole but not anymore.
Thanks for this. I'll read the post and comments again tomorrow when I reset my badge. 10/6/17.
