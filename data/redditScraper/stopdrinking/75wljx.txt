I had a dream where I went to some school reunion type function and decided to drink. I blacked out and the next morning had to cope with having drank and all the horrible things I had done while under the influence. My dream self kept hoping and thinking she dreamt that she drank! ..I think this is my unconscious brain's go-to nightmare now when I am really stressed out which I am currently. I think an important thing for me to do is pay attention to what my brain is telling me that I am stressed out.  That I need to deal with it before I drink for real...I love you all and will not drink with you today.

I look at it as a gift.  The one helpful thing that a relapse had to offer me was to strengthen my resolve.  Dreams are like getting that benefit without the poison. :-).
&gt;pay attention to what my brain is telling me that I am stressed out. ..An indicator of wisdom!  I notice flags and markers in my life that previously I ignored. I attend to them now!
