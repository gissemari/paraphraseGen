I've struggled with the idea of a higher power but I realize that I've made many things a higher power in my life - booze cigarettes ego...I've decided that I will always have a higher power but I now want it to be something that serves me in a healthy way. I resisted this idea for a long time because I didn't believe in God. I'm experimenting with the idea that a higher power is perfection - the universe. I'm a biologist so I think that the universe is made up of energy which can't be created or destroyed and that our own energy affects other people other beings and other things. Our collective energy is a source of power for me and I want my energy to be positive. I guess quantum physics is my higher power. :)

Congratulations!!!! 
I've not commented until now just lurked but this has made me take the leap!  I've been doing a lot of reading this week on sobriety and saw a book on the Law of Attraction recommended and so started reading that. I'm in A.A. and until now (day 34) had the fellowship/humanity in my mind as my Higher Power as I don't believe in God but this has also clicked with me too! I've been  praying' as such as in putting good vibes out there for those I resent  or for the strength to keep this up and now I totally relate to the universe/energy/Quantum physics as being my HP as little as I understand it lol.  Thanks for your post! 
Good   
That's as good an explanation of higher power as any. Go with it and good luck. :)
