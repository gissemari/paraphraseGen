This is my first post here...11 days so far and it is Friday night when I would usually drink 3/4 of a bottle of wine to "reduce stress" and really just sedate myself. Worked late and now I am by myself. For the first time since I stopped I am really really craving a drink. Well the first few days were a struggle but I worked my way through it. It was a good day except for one thing that pissed me off and I am craving to use that to open a bottle of wine. ..I bought the Annie Grace audio book and have made it to liminal point 4. I listened to a couple of chapters at least twice I found it so useful. ..I am going to watch TV by myself and drink water and then listen to the Annie book. Too tired to get on my bicycle. ..Edit: Next morning no hangover. Thanks for the support Reddit!

Sweet snacks were a good deterrent for me in the early days. You can do this!!!
Waking up tomorrow without a hangover is going to feel SO GOOD. I love Saturday mornings so much now!! You have lots to look forward to :)
I won't drink with you on this Friday night!
