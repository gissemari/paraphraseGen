Well I can't escape a visual reminder so here is my timeline. I need to put this first photo on the freaking background of my phone (I really don't want to it is so awful but I know for damn sure looking at that I will def think twice before picking up)...The last year and a half-ish:..[day 1 1/16](http://imgur.com/a/NobOs) I quit my job & found SD. Prior to this photo I would loose my breath on stairs I couldn't go long enough without drinking to complete a shift I drank 24/7 & only left the house to go to the liquor store. I was spending like $30 a day easy on booze I don't think I was showering I know I was neglecting my dogs and house I def know I wasn't eating although the photo looks like I ate all the time lol.. .[30 days](http://imgur.com/a/PQ7iC) I survived the month of hell. I remember laying on my couch with a bucket next to it throwing up anything that went in me. Oh and I had to use the electric cart at Walmart because I was in too much physical pain to stand more than 2 minutes... yeah pretty sad but I was on the road to recovery at least...[90ish days](http://imgur.com/a/FfroV) I think by this point I was back to fully functioning. Hiking keeping up with a daily routine taking care of myself and my family. Shortly after this photo I relapsed. Then got clean for a few months...*Super relapsed* drinking as bad as 2015 & my life exploded - Lost the dogs lost the husband (it was a good thing - super abusive relationship hints the drinking) lost the house went to jail left the state.....**28 days of rehab in September** *& then these were taken in Feb & March*..[6 months](http://imgur.com/a/4VV4G) Living with grandma who is letting me stay for free so I can fix my credit & get back on my feet. My ENTIRE family lives within a 5 mile radius and know everything. My aunt (in the photo) went with me to my first obstacle race which is something I always wanted to do. We have done Out of the Darkness walk have Relay for life & Flavor Run in May...*mini relapse*..Some how my I screwed it up. I had everything going for me. Look how freaking happy I was in the last photos!?! Thankfully my family saw the signs and pulled me back in before I drowned. I am so blessed to have them they are disappointed but they have my back and are giving me a second chance so I still have a home THANK GOD!..You would think that the rehab center telling me I have Angry Liver (yes it's a thing - I thought my doctor was insulting me but no tis indeed a thing) would be enough for me to not want to drink ever again..... well as sad as it is to say it wasn't. Or all the things that happened at the end of year and the constant state of fear I was living in - nope. Things in my life became "normal" and I slacked on staying active on the things most important to my recovery and wasn't vigilant...[Today day 5 4/23](http://imgur.com/a/oVm0q) Back on SD going to meetings getting back on a schedule (I woke up at 7 and went to bed by midnight!) enjoying a coffee and eating breakfast grounded (yup 28 and my mom is driving me around) past the first few shitty detox days but still on that first month rollercoaster plans to hit the 9-5 job hunt hard next week trying for the military in Sept (cross your fingers) 4th ish attempt at sobriety learning from her mistakes stronger everytime lucky to have a supportive family IRL and here on SD...Never give up - there is always a hand reaching out to help you back on the wagon :) & keep an eye out for those red flags...[High Five](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg)..

What a turnaround Red!  You should be proud of the work that you've done and that you are still doing!!
That day one pic is brutal...Your current and mid-sobriety pics show the fun wild happy Red we all love. I bet you'll make a great soldier! ..Keep up the meetings! I'm so proud of you!!!
It's like you found the fountain of youth as time progressed. Pretty amazing how alcohol can kick our asses both physically and mentally. Good thing our bodies are so resilient and can recover from poison.
Red you are making such progress! These pictures show it! Hang in there be kind to yourself and don't be afraid to lean on others!  
Holy shit. You don't even look like the same person! Thank you for sharing. I won't drink with you today. 
"But first coffee" is a great tee shirt...you will be back to the smiling and bright-eyed red in no time! I can already see the hope shining through. I'll not drink with you today.
Thank you for posting this &amp; sharing! I love picture lists! You can see the difference and you've come a long way! Welcome back &amp; I won't drink with you today!!
I am so happy you are here...you don't even look like the same person. I won't drink with you today!
Thanks so much for your bravery in sharing this and your bravery in letting your family see the real you and in enduring their disappointment so you could get better - that's real self-love the good &amp; genuine kind.  You are awesome and amazing!  And btw if anyone ever treats you with violence again you tell us here we'll come beat the living shit out of him. 
Aw Red you're beautiful inside and out! Ya know which one I really like? The mud one - what f'n strength girl!! I consider myself privileged to have watched you and shared this journey with you along - through the highs and lows - we got here together with SD...I get ya on the placing-worst-pic on wallpaper; I did that with (of all pic's) the one with 2 IV's running through my veins. Yup. Let's just say it wasn't a pretty pic for anyone else to see when my phone was lying around - they would be like are you OK Lee? WTF? And I didn't have any problems with telling them why...Oooooooh so you're shooting for Sept for the military? I've often wondered about how you're doing with that process so I'm glad to hear it. I think that would be incredibly awesome and can't wait to hear more about it!! ..Thanks for sharing the timeline love ya babe! xo :)
admire your determination...like the Phoenix..keep rising...all the best
You have an indomitable spirit Red; always happy to see you here!
