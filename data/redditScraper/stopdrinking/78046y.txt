Good evening good afternoon or good morning SD'ers..Firstly I am so very glad to still be here that my slip up didn't turn into a relapse especially since I recently posted about how a relapse looks for me - basically *ugly* is the only way to describe it! And of course a huge thank you for all the wonderful support I have received from the amazing people here on SD xx ..The slip up was also a reminder to myself that I had become arrogant in my sobriety - self will was taking control &amp; I started to believe that I was invincible because I thought that if I was aware of my triggers then I could control them - um Quirky that's not quite how it works..... it is part of the process but there is so much more to understand &amp; accept!..Today I am grateful for my 2 wonderful pets - *just a heads up the pic of Tonka is an extreme close- up of his face &amp; it kind of jumps at you lol*  [Trusting Tonka Dog](https://i.imgur.com/xcA7JC5.jpg) &amp; [Seraphina's Favourite Place!](https://i.imgur.com/7iGbwZJ.jpg) And even though Seraphina snores &amp; Tonka has smelly farts they give me a reason to smile in the morning by the very simple act of saying "Good morning" to them!..Today I am grateful that I *like* to "MacGyver" things - if something needs to be done I only have myself to rely on so I can usually find some *interesting* ways to manage - today I created a privacy "screen" for my front door by attaching shade cloth to it &amp; ta da I can see out &amp; people can't see in! It won't be in house &amp; garden but I am happy because it works &amp; I did it!..Today I am grateful that I am in a position to focus on my recovery that I don't have responsibilities to other people so I can take the time to find what works for me &amp; what doesn't - it is a gift that the people currently in my life *(except for them at Wednesdays meeting)* are only about my support &amp; because they have no intimate family or deep friendship emotional investment in me then the advice they offer is only for my own wellbeing...Practising Gratitude is integral to my living sober &amp; well &amp; posting here on SD is such an important part of that process! Also reading your replies on what is helping you feel grateful in living alcohol free is an important part of this journey. So please help encourage &amp; support each other by posting your gratitude whether it is Momentous Emotional Mundane or Humorous we all learn &amp; grow from sharing!..Stay strong stay brave &amp; practise kindness to self &amp; others xx..Gratefully &amp; proudly I will not be drinking with you!.

Good evening Quirky!  Love hearing that you are feeling good.  My gratitude this morning is coffee.  When I was drinking my stomach could sometimes not handle coffee but I'm full on killing coffee daily now.  Coffee and I are so happy together.  I'm also grateful for staying alcohol free through a party last night and even with my husband drinking I stayed true.  Tonka's soulful eye!!  Seraphina's comfy spot!  I will find a way to post my dogs and chickens one day!  Sleep well!
Glad that you are still posting gratitudes.  And glad that your slip didn't turn into relapse and take you away from us!..I'm grateful that today I'm not struggling with cravings and obsessions...and that I'm coming around to really feeling like I'm not missing out and that sobriety does not equate to any kind of deprivation in my life.
I aspire to be the person my dig thinks I am!..Have you seen this [Wendys Dog](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=H17edn_RZoY)...Which always reminds me of the query:.."Do you know What does the dyslexic agnostic insomniac does"
Your cat snores? That's so cute I've never heard any of mine snore! And she's such a beautiful colour!  ...I'm so glad you caught yourself quickly and didn't let your slip turn into anything worse. You brighten this place up with your positivity!  
Hello sweet Quirky! So glad you are doing well. Big love to you and your fellow doggies! Let them fart and snore as much as they like; sweet souls :) xxxxxxx
Great post. Keep at it. 
So lovely to see your beautiful doggie pic. Once I can figure out how I will post some of ours - they are called Frodo and Pip :-)..Grateful for loads of things today especially for seeing our daughter heading back to uni tomorrow morning. We have just played the Terry Prachett board fame - the Witches fab! ..Volunteered this morning at the hospice which was calm and peaceful as usual. ..Hope your crochet experimenting continues to be fun.  Bit late posting this but... IWNDWYT :-)
Hi Quirky! I admire your macgyvering ability. I try but am sorry to say it isn't my forte. :-) ..Today I am grateful for my car. In May 2016 I decided I was done with my "mom car" and bought something that while not expensive is still quite impractical (small and only 2 seats) ... and I LOVE it! Makes me so happy to cruise around in it on a warm fall day. ..Hoping that by the time you read this you will have enjoyed a peaceful and refreshing night of sleep. xo 
Fabulous post Quirky :).xoxoxoxoxo
Yesterday I told my husband I Love Being Sober. I have been saying it to myself lately but not out loud. I am grateful I told him and I am grateful it is true.
