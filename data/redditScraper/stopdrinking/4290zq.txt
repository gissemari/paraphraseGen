There is more to getting well than simply not drinking. I had to experience personal growth to learn how to be sober and happy. Rehab a therapist and AA helped me accomplish this. ..What do you foresee happening if you continue drinking?
That's rough I'm sorry to hear it. Do you have health insurance? Rehab might be a good option if you do; I know it sounds drastic but if you can find a good clinic you really can learn a LOT about how to keep yourself sober. 
I did something very similar. After my binge I knew there was no going back I had to face my problem drinking. It was scary and intimidating to me and something I didn't want to have to do but I knew I had to.
