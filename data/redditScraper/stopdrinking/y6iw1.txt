So tonight I watched episode 1 of the new season. I watched this show all the time when I was drinking and watched it when I first got sober. But for some reason tonight hit me pretty hard. This young lady was struggling with alcohol as we all have....and for some reason all I could think of is I can't do this. I can't drink in front of my kid. I've had these stupid thoughts recently that "You're okay" "You got this!" "Just try one night". After watching this episode it hit me like a brick wall. I don't want my kid to grow up and do this because I WAS A TERRIBLE EXAMPLE. I quit when my child was 1 1/2 so I realize she may never know this alcoholic. I can't tell you how much this community has meant to me and how much AA has meant to me. It's made getting through nights like tonight easier. It's made me realize I'm not good. I am very sick even when I look good. I look forward to seeing everyone who can make it on Thursday.

So I talked to my parents this weekend about my decision to stop drinking and they were a bit surprised - it's my brother who's the family alcoholic...And I said: *Well I've realised that for me it's simpler not to drink at all than to try drinking sensibly*. Right now it's pretty easy for me but I intend to remember that in the future when my brain (or my brother!) whispers "go on just one can't hurt"...7 months is **awesome**. Well done!
It says a lot that you are able to recognize that you're having thoughts that would potentially be destructive to your life (and that of your child) should you give in to them. Hopefully you'll continue to fight the good fight and tell those thoughts to eff off! ;)
