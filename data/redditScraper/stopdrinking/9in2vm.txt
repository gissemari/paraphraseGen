I went sober for a month (1st time since I started drinking) and decided a week ago to have some sake at a sushi place with friends.  After the meal I thought "Well I already f'd up today so I might as well actually get a buzz since I'm half way there already" so went out and bought a 6 pack...In the week that followed my room became trashed like it was before I called out of work twice only showered a couple times spent WAY too much money on late night food delivery stopped exercising smoked some again (which I had quit even before trying to sober up) etc... I could go on...So...her goes round 2!  On the plus side it already feels easier than the first time.  Last time I had 10 years of drinking to ween off of.  This time just 1 week of it.  Oh and I got a cool new badge here.  I think I'll be fine :)

Yep. It was something I heard when I did outpatient therapy that you pick up where you left off and I didn't necessarily believe it till I relapsed after 3 years. Within a week I was an absolute mess. It's definately a lesson that most of us have to learn at some point. ..Good luck partner. 
Welcome back.  IWNDWYT 
Totally know how this feels man. Downed a bottle of wine wine in an hour on Saturday night after about three weeks clean. Also smoked half a pack. Felt like shit the next day. It's amazing how poisonous that stuff is..
Welcome back iwndwyt.
This is pretty much exactly what happened my last relapse. I try to vividly picture it whenever I think about drinking. 
Bravo on round 2!
Me too. Had a glass of champagne at a friend's wedding that turned into a binge. It made me so sick and I picked up a cold that made me feel awful for 2 weeks. It's just not for me.
