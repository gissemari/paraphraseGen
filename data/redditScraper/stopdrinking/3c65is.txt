I can't handle the thought of not having another drink left when I finish this one. ..I can't seem to explain to my husband that I'm not being dramatic - I need help and asking for it isn't working. ..I can't figure out what the problem is - it's just all too hard...I just can't do it. ..I can't figure out how to feel ok...I can't get myself out of this relapse even though I've been trying and trying for god knows how long now. ..I can't stand that my life is slowly spiralling down the drain and I just don't even care. ..I can't decide what to do next - drinking seems to be the only thing that makes it better. ..I have never been able to imagine what my world would be like when I hit 'rock bottom' but this morning I actually looked up what happens if someone walks into the ER and tells them they need help...I just can't. ..I'm not ok.

I have felt that way before.  Yes you can do this and figure out how to be OK again.
Please seek professional help if you are having suicidal thoughts. We here at SD defer to medical professionals and are not allowed to dispense medical advice of any kind. I can say that you may want to check out the FAQ/sidebar of this sub. There is helpful knowledge there about someone in your situation. Drinking may seem like the only thing that is making your life better and that is the saddest aspect of addiction imho. It's the fact that it will twist reality so far and so badly that the user cannot see that drinking is in fact the only thing that is making your life worse. It is a pretty serious thing to mention suicide in here and as I said please seek professional help. It is not of mine or anyone else's liberty here to say anything beyond that except I am very sorry to hear that. I hope you get the help you need. Are you relapsing right now? Please only post when sober.
