That is a great achievement! On to another 28 years! 
Congrats!! I wonder lately if I would've gotten sober at that age where my life would be. But I imagine yours is pretty normal with ups and downs - or do you live in a castle fly only in private jets and have a man menagerie (with a couple of pretty ladies too) at your disposal? 
Discovering you have an addiction and putting the stop to it at that age where getting wasted was like a top priority for so many man that takes some guts. You are certainly different in that way and in a good way. Congrats!
Thats amazing! Congrats! 
So many teens and twenty somethings struggle with being too young to be sick and therefore too young to recover.  Your experience can help a lot of people.  I hope you are able to share it frequently.  Best wishes for very long term sobriety
That really is amazing. Congratulations. At some level I knew I was a drunk at that early age but it took me til I was 35 to finally get sober. I too have 28 years and change now but am not living on yesterday's sobriety. . .it's all about today for me. Thanks for posting.
This is great.  There are lots of folks wondering if they are too young to get sober.       Now they know
Amazing!  
Wow! I got sober for the first time at 16 and stayed that way for ten years. At 26 I decided I'd quit too young and gave it another go. Here I am at 42 trying to pick up the pieces. I'm impressed by your story - and also pretty jealous!! Keep on keepin' on.
Do you ever have the desire to drink?
That's awesome. Thanks for the post.
Congratulations...One of my longest best friends in AA has been sober since he was 19.    He will have 38 years the 18th of this month...keep on keepin' on.
