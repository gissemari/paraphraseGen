So I woke up on the fifteenth of November hungover as hell. I decided to go buy a massive 4ft x 4ft canvas that day brought it home and wrote how I felt about A.) relationships/people in my life B.) alcoholism/addiction and C.) graffiti. Once I began writing it flowed naturally and I could feel the raw energy coming in waves of emotion. I eventually sealed how I felt into that canvas by glueing ripped up newspaper all over it then painting it with spray paint then tagging all over it. A few weeks later I took it to a ditch propped it on the wall and painted a piece over it. I took this canvas to a restaurant hung it up and it's titled Foundation.  All my struggles losses highs and lows were put into it and the small section of graffiti on top was the final product. Might sound cheesey but I felt as if I sealed my demons inside that canvas and made peace with myself. ..Shortly after that on November 22nd I smoked my last three cigarettes I haven't smoked since...This Christmas Eve Christmas and New Year was the first Ive spent completely sober in twelve years. It was also spent with the love of my life and was abso-fuckin-lutely incredible. The best most memorable holiday season I've ever had. And for that I'm incredibly thankful. ..Yesterday after staring into the sunset I had an emotional overload and a thought shit storm. After four years of investing my time and life into illegal graffiti destroying the entire city painting 200+ trains going to jail twice and using it as a temporary escape from all my pains troubles and thoughts I made the conscious decision that I no longer need that escape. Graffiti was a reflection of my own self destructive behavior and I feel as if I've made peace with all that's happened throughout my life and with myself. The thrill is gone but it was fun while it lasted...I have a lot to look forward to this year and I also look forward to redirecting my energy into art work and weathering model trains. I believe everything that's happened has been taken as a lesson and should be used for character development. I'm thankful for a lot of things right now. And I think that's the first time I've ever typed that out and meant it whole heartedly.
