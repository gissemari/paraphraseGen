Hey all. I'm new around these parts and I figured this might be the best place to start (though I'll likely be looking at other resources too. Won't scoff at recommendations!)..I've had a weight-loss surgery some time back and mentally I still struggle to adapt to that...Before the surgery I was a pro in drinking and shaking it all off. Wasn't ever a problem never interfered with my life never went terribly overboard. The surgery though changed a lot about how my body handles alcohol...I get hit harder and faster and if I don't consciously tell myself to stop after one or two drinks I lose control and completely go overboard...It's started to interfere with my life hurt family and friends caused trust issues. Of course I'd like to believe I'm the master of my own decisions but serious self-reflection always comes to the same point: after two drinks anything more and I will lose control of my inhibition...I've already stopped liquor entirely since that's the easiest way to overdrink. Sticking with only wine (beer is a bit uncomfortable since the surgery)...The reason I post now though is because on Monday I am starting a new job and a new life with that. I do not under any circumstances want to risk ruining this amazing chance I have...I guess in the end I'm just curious if anyone's been in the same position or if there are any words of advice that can be shared. I'd rather not go down the slope of completely ruining my life.

Congrats on the new job! and the new resolve to quit drinking! I'm new to this myself so I don't have much practical advice but lots of support and encouragement for you!
