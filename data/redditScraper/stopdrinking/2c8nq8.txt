Several months ago I was riding my bicycle and a car turned in front of me and I totaled my bike. I was down for the count physically for about a month and have since been in a brutal battle with the drivers insurance company trying to get some money to buy a new bike. Basically the cop who interviewed us determined I was at fault because I should have let the car turn in front of me (total BS. The car turned into me didn't use a blinker it was a driveway on a main street I had right of way yada yada yada). I couldn't afford an attorney so I argued for months and months and had several relapses during that process. I'm not going to defend my relapses but they were(in my opinion) the result of stress and not being able to exercise at all for over a month and not partake in my passion: cycling. Well yesterday I finally reached an agreement that allows me to not deal with this stuff anymore and return to what I love. ..What does this have to do with drinking? This was a super hard situation to deal with and I relapsed several times (though fortunately they weren't very long benders). I knew then and I know now that that wasn't the best way to deal with the situation and consequently it got me motivated to see a psychologist to develop coping strategies that don't involve drinking. That's a success in my book as I've been doing better the last few weeks. Now that I'm done with all the crap I'm really excited to move forward and have my favorite non-drinking outlet again.

Welcome /u/daybyday9 to /r/stopdrinking -- I'm a cyclist going back almost 5 decades and unfortunately I've survived multiple situations like yours and worse (a couple of actual assault(s) and battery(s) by self-entitled motorists).  My reaction--self-righteous anger and even rage is one of the things the Big Book warns us against if we are going to avoid relapse so you are quite correct in believing that your emotions and reactions played a role in relapse.  I'm glad you are beyond that now.  ..BTW there are quite a few of us SOBER cyclists on /r/stopdrinking so you will get a sympathetic ear.  My suggested alternative approach to dealing with this situation--hire a cycling lawyer.
Kudos for having the wisdom to seek help from a psychologist. We are not born knowing coping skills and you figured that out. Seize the day!
