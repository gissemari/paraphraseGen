I'm still amazed I've come this far. I feel fantastic- full of energy no anxiety happy (truly happy) accomplishing SO much! Enjoying and living in the moment; rather than waking up with anxiety regret exhaustion. I am loving myself. I honestly never thought I'd get here. But I'm here and I never want to let this go. ..Thank you SD- for helping me get here. You guys are the BEST!..Those of you struggling- please don't give up. I never thought I'd even get to 30 days let alone a week. If I can do it...so can you. Life is so much better on the other side!!
