Any advise? I already listened to dharma punk called a warmline been crying for an hour at least.  I've ashed a cigarette into an undrunk beer. I know my brain is lying but I just want the pain to be numb? I'm new I keep relapsing on the weekend. I'm putting too much pressure on myself and yet not enough lol.

I have some solutions that worked for me but some people don't agree with them. For the first few weeks I follow "Anything but drinking" It's the only thing that gets me to not drink the first bit. I want a drink I get food. I want a drink I'll smoke a cigarette. I want a drink I'll take a nap. You get the idea just do things that you derive pleasure from that you're not addicted to. ..&amp;#x200B;..Honestly even if you are addicted to those other things fuck it you'll figure those out later once your head is right from being sober. If you can do this you can do anything. You got this.
Make a gratitude list.
I always just go to bed.
