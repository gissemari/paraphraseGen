After my relapse at 56 days. I guess the time really does double quickly in the beginning.  I will not drink today

I am at 56 days and know I have to be vigilant.With the nice weather a month or so away I have to deal with BBQ and ...no beer or wine...going to be weird..Congrats on 4 days 
This is a victory!  And we learn from experience a good thing.  Congrats!
I came so close to relapsing this weekend which would have been right around 56 days. Honestly if it weren't for lucky circumstances I probably would have :-( I hate feeling like sobriety is a mousetrap ready at any moment to get triggered and snap.
