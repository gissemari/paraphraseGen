Hi everyone..&amp;#x200B;..I'm finding this evening a real struggle. I had no idea that my cravings for drinking would be as powerful as they have been. I have never been the heaviest of drinkers though what these last few difficult days have proven is that even if I wasn't drinking to oblivion all the time I was very much reliant. It became my go to for any negative feelings. The desire for that numbness has gotten especially strong tonight. ..&amp;#x200B;..My reliance on alcohol was also really rather short lived. Another reason that the intensity of the struggle I'm feeling is so surprising to me. There isn't much purpose to this post other than venting some feelings and reaching out for some accountability and community from you inspirational group of people. ..&amp;#x200B;..I want to stop because I could feel the snowball gathering pace I could sense I was heading down a slippery slope that would potentially become increasingly difficult to climb back up. I also feel like alcohol has stopped me from taking important positive steps towards addressing my various mental health struggles. I have never reached ruin through booze but rather I feel like it was holding me back and ruin was somewhere off in the ever closer distance...&amp;#x200B;..I will not drink with you today. I wish everyone all the strength in the world!
