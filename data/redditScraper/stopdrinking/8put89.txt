I have been in 4 different 12 step based treatment centers over the last 10 years. Been to hundreds of meetings step work very serious sponsor. But it just wasn't for me. Simplist way I can put it. The disease concept just set me up to fail. Just relapse after relapse. But then my sister overcame a binge eating disorder using the Rational Recovery methods and pointed me towards it. So I dove in started reading up on it and implementing the techniques. Addictive Voice Recognition Technique etc..and it has changed my fucking life. FINALLY something that works for me and it is absurdly simple. Was curious if anyone else out there is familiar with it and what feedback or advice might you have? I'd really appreciate to hear back from you folks. Thanks so much.

I'm a fan of a 'pick and mix' approach to recovery and I do quite like RR as one technique that can be useful among many.....I called my AV the Booze Goblin and pictured him as a separate entity to my 'self' who looks and sounds rather like Gollum from Lord Of The Rings!..Congrats on 70 days keep up the good work!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
So happy for your success!
Awesome!  Sounds good   .IWNDWYT 
Yep I did it with Rational Recovery after a couple failed attempts. The crash coarse felt shocking to read at first but It helped me look at things honestly and take responsibility for my life. Now 800 days tommorow.
