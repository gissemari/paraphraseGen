.**Stage 1:**:Adolescence... .**Stage 2:** Drinking for fun. Drinking to turn my introverted self into an extroverted bad ass. I have no idea I'll ever be addicted. I completely feel like alcohol is my friend my magic my cure all. ....**Stage 3**: I start to realize I'm addicted. I realize I need alcohol in my life. I find myself drinking in the morning at lunch in the evening. I realize alcohol being drunk is the only time I feel normal. It's the only time I feel right confident ready for whatever.  . .**Stage 4:** Use my Crohns disease as a method to get people/doctors to give me prescription drugs. Start taking Methadone Vicodin Soma anxiety pills (can't remember the name) ambien. Turn into a zombie. I barely eat barely sleep. I use Methadone and Vicodin to cure my hangover. Anxiety pills  for those times I try/need to sober up.. Ambien and Soma to try and sleep. ..**Stage 5:** fuck up. At this point I started using alcohol just to get me through the day. I would limit my use to just the amount that I needed to not get sick. I bought a fith large mistake. I drank the fith took the methadone soma and vicodin. I'm not sure if I was trying to kill myself. I passed out. I woke up on my way to the E.R.. I stayed two days (I think it's very blurry) then entered a 30-day rehab. At this point I want to be sober or die. Suicide seems like a viable option because I have no faith in myself. Rehab is cool I feel like I've got a good grip on reality now and will never drink again. Leave rehab drink one week later. Start drinking more than before. Somehow in my brain I felt ok with drinking more because I was the definition of a alcoholic. Now living back at my parents. (GF of three years broke up with me also got a DUI) sink into a depressive suicidal state more drinking more pills. This last for 4 months. ..**Stage 6**: Parents realize they can't help me. Start looking for rehab. We're broke everyone in my family is broke. Start looking for free rehabs. Find Teen Challenge a free faith based solution to the drug epidemic. Enter program. Literally this program does nothing but keep you busy keep you going to church and sleeping. I learned basically one thing...I can last 7 months sober. I don't feel like I learned any 'tools' here. ..**Stage 7:** leave T.C. Because I've had it with the slave labor and zero talk about addiction. Move into a sober living house get a job stay sober for about 3 weeks. Start drinking lightly. Half pint a day. Three days out of seven I would test positive for booze. ..**Stage 8:** Currently not sure what to do with myself. I'm maintaining pretty well compared to my past. I'm working paying bills and I guess that's it.  I would love to go to an actual rehab one that does more than offer a sober situation but I can't afford it.

Have you tried AA meetings?  They offer great in person interaction.  That is the next best thing to rehab for sure.  You will find lots of great people and advice to teach you to stay sober.  This saved my life for sure.  I learned some stuff in rehab. but without regular AA meetings no way would I still be sober...You can do this give it a try!!!
What I hear at many AA meetings is how well people are doing and how they've used the recovery tools to get there. Maybe a few more meetings would put you in touch with these positive-minded people. ..You were fortunate to go to rehab. ..If you don't take the first drink you'll stay sober.  
Welcome /u/n00bsysadmin --you did an outstanding job of laying out the progression of your alcoholism.  Let's get sober.
