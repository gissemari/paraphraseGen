After a difficult weekend im finding myself struggling. I had a friends birthday in wine country as the designated driver then went to the races the next day with my sister and a friend. I found these activities challanging but felt proud of myself for keeping sober. It wasnt too hard. When i got home the cravings went mental. I powered through them by making dinner and watching some monkey magic. But now im exhausted and i have a huge headache. Its like my brain is angry at me for denying it what it wants. I also have the guilts and all the memories of all the fuck ups ive made because of alcohol surging through my minds eye.This should be getting easier physically at least. I hope this fades over night. Where is this bloody pink cloud everyone talks about?

When it's bad it's going to feel bad. Maybe a chocolate milkshake? An early night? Congratulations for getting through some major social events.  That is huge achievement!
It's typically the day after being around alcohol that you have to worry about the best way to avoid cravings is to minimize triggers try changing people places things for a bit Good luck!
Talking to other alcoholics and realizing this is to be expected usually helps me.  Do you go to any meetings?
I've had hangovers from this kind of thing--party was all fine and enjoyable people drinking but not me and no bother. But the next day--I was wiped out--had that familiar emotional deadness. Haven't quite found the solution to this. ..Good on you to be thinking about this--it was kind of a surprise and is still a puzzler for me.
