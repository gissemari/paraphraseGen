I polished off a fifth a few beers and two glasses of champagne and didn't feel a damn thing. I felt sober. I decided enough was enough...I've been struggling with depression since a relationship broke down a year ago. My bottle was my way to cope. Sometimes if I'm really desperate I'll take a swig of mouth wash or vanilla extract. I've been that way for years actually and I've been well aware. But now I'm at the point where I'm not able to escape through drinking any more so I've decided to change...I'm tired of living for when the sun goes down. So I can binge and not feel bad about it. I'm tired of living for social situations where I can drink..and not having an interest in going out if I can't...I'm going to change. It's going to be fucking hard. But I can do it.....Help me.

So what's the plan?..Welcome suggest you start by reading our stories linked in the sidebar. See who we are and how we quit and STAYED QUIT.
Welcome /u/ISaidIAm to r/stopdrinking--I've met many people who changed in their lives.  Do you have "next things" you want to do to stay sober?  AA meetings?  Treatment or an IOP? At [this link I describe some simple first steps that I took to get sober.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Maybe something there will strike you as helpful.  Good luck.
