Its crazy i never thought i'd be in this position. At 26 i feel great lost a ton of weight things are improving as i become more accountable and more confidence. The mental urge is still there but one day at a time. Life is good! For those struggling i'd advise to persevere.

Been a little over ten years for me.  All I can say is one day at a time.  Sometimes an hour at a time and sometimes a minute or less at a time.  It does get better but not easier...the impulses are always there but you get better at telling them to fuck off.  Congrats on 150 days and kerp it up!!!!
Beating me by 1 day haha! Congrat's dude well done :)

Congrats. Hopefully the cravings will leave you soon. Losing weight being accountable and more confidence they are such a bonus.  Well done you deserve it.
Keep it up!! How's yr wallet feeling?
Good for you I can't wait to see where you'll be at 300 days sober.
Congrats! You're my quit buddy! :) Ditto on the feeling great - I've lost over 20lbs started exercising and finally felt ready to quit smoking three weeks ago. Honestly I don't even think about drinking anymore I've moved on to other self-improvements (though I still attend SMART meetings for drinking - do NOT want to become complacent). 
That's phenomenal. Congrats!
