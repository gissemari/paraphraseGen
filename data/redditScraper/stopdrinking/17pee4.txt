I have been struggling with stopping drinking with the old "why do I have such a destructive relationship with alcohol?" question driving me crazy.  I couldn't understand why me and not my friends and family...Today my perception changed a bit. I was in the supermarket near the alcohol aisle (wasn't buying any!) and I overhear a conversation next to me...Guy 1: do you think we should pick up any beer for this evening?..Guy 2: I'm fine thanks alcohol doesn't suit me...I just thought that was a nice way of looking at it.  Simple and more forgiving as we all have things that don't suit us :) I will remember this.

There are some people who just can't drink. I'm one of them. It took me 23 years to finally concede to that simple fact. Now I consider myself to be allergic to alcohol. The allergy manifests in me not being able to stop drinking once I start. One drink is too much but a thousand isn't enough...Now I have actually stopped though I just have to remind myself never to start again. Just like I have to remind my doctor never to give me penicillin...After a thousand days or so of not drinking it's second nature for me to say:.."Not for me please".."I'm not drinking today".."I've got work in the morning".."I'm driving".."I don't drink but thank you anyway"...Today I no more want to take a drink as put a bullet in my head so the response is automatic. All it takes is daily practice..
**"WHY?" is a management question. I am not management.**..For me the beauty of having a power greater than me is the ability to let go of so of the "whys" that make me crazy. Why can't I drink like other people? Why don't things turn out the way I want? Why did that person say or do that? ..I think other people call this process acceptance. Others talk about life on life's turns. I'm just trying to do the next right thing and remember that I am not calling all the shots in the universe. ..Yours is a nice thought. Thank you for sharing it.
