I would HIGHLY recommend Russell Brands book or particularly his audio book Recovery Freedom from our addictions. It's based on the 12 step program (Which has always nauseated me due the the religious connotations) but he avoids the dogma and just speaks absolute hilarious sense...It's definitely changed the way i have begun to see myself why I drink/drug and the world around me. I've read Allen Carr's The easy way .. The Naked Mind and several cognitive behaviour books I'm also a Subscriber to Kevin O'hara etc but not one of them have ever resonated with me the way that this audio book has...Obviously it's on audible amazon etc it's also on a certain bay that folks tend to sometimes visit (Russell won't mind he's rich as fuck and just trying to help others ;) ) It's around eight hours in length to listen to but it will be worth every second of your time. BTW I'm not a corporate shill most of my previous posts are about Darkest Dungeon...Stay safe and have a great day fellow redditors x
