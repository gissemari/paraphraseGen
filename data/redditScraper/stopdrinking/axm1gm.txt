Finally made it back into the double digits. I feel so weak and dumb that it's this hard to get here for me but I know I need to change that thought process. I don't usually struggle with something once I've decided to do it and this is something I've been trying and failing to do for what seems like years and years. I knew I had a problem a long time before I tried to do anything about it but just kept tricking myself into justifying "one more night". ..I didn't mean for this post to have a negative tone but it took on a life of it's own. Thank you to everyone here on r/stopdrinking. You are all an inspiration! I'm happy that I'm here and am committed to not drinking...I will not drink with you today
