[The art of sidestepping booze for a month](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/105203949/kiwibuild-couples-earning-up-to-180k-will-be-able-to-buy-homes)..The above is basically a "survival guide" for New Zealanders if they wish to do Dry July and give up booze for a month...If that makes us sound like a nation of alcoholics you might not be mistaken...&gt;Nearly 6000 Kiwis are attempting to get through July without booze.   .&gt;  .&gt;They are the official entrants in [Dry July ](https://www.dryjuly.co.nz/)and are mixing booze avoidance with raising money for cancer victims.  .&gt;  .&gt;But many more Kiwis are likely to be coat-tailing on the scheme at home and making a private deal to cut out the alcohol and see how much better that makes them feel.  .&gt;  .&gt;For both groups ***saying no when you really want a drink is going to be hard.***..Now I'm never going to belittle the struggle to stop drinking especially when I'm going through it myself and its not easy. But my issue here is the normalisation of extreme alcohol consumption in our culture to the point where giving up booze for a month is seen like some kind of heroic effort...Some of the comments at least reflect on it...&gt;How sad state for this country is it when people can't go a month without alcohol. Is it that indoctrinate into our culture that we must drink just to be a real kiwi. And the fact that people struggle to go without alcohol during July is truly disappointing...&gt;It's true. It's our culture. Try go anywhere and not drink everyone wonders what is wrong with you if you're not drinking. It becomes even more apparent when you go overseas (depends where of course) and you notice that other people can go out and enjoy themselves without being drunk. That would never happen in the cities here on a Friday or a Saturday night. That is our  normal'...This is ultimately why I get so frustrated with this article and our culture at large. It's seen a normal nay mandatory to drink. As mentioned in This Naked Mind alcohol is the only drug you have to justify not taking and here it's even worse because often your justification isn't accepted. And [despite public service campaigns to try and bring attention to the issue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y91xgcTROsU) nothing is really changing...It's like being surrounded by a bunch of bad friends who keep pressuring you to drink. Even at work! You're antisocial if you don't go to work drinks. You're not a team player if you don't turn up to staff parties. Hell our department has had meetings at the pub...It really makes something that is already hard even harder. It's why avoidance strategies are useless for me because there's just no escaping it... ..Sorry... just needed to vent.

Not just NZ my friend. It's equally bad in the UK. Maybe even worse. Stay strong.  
I grew up in small town America where drinking is life bc there isn't anything else to do. Quitting has been tough bc I'm surrounded by it - friends family work etc. I feel your frustrations Annie Grace's book really helped me too...I went on vacation to a 'developing' country hoping that maybe I could escape alcohol. It was there tho. The locals didn't drink however they had no problem selling booze to the foreigners. It was gross. Some of the best beaches and seafood I've ever experienced and most people there were probs to drunk to remember it.
Have you checked out livingsober.org.nz?  It a support group for sobriety started by Lotta Dann a Kiwi.  People there are from all over but mostly Kiwis. Keep on keeping on.  IWNDWYT
