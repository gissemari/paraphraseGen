Saturday night I relapsed. I went on a fully premeditated bender and woke up in the hospital with no memory of getting there or what had happened during the previous 4 hours. I have 5 stitches in my chin two in an eyebrow and another on my cheek. Two of my back teeth are chipped with significant portions missing. ..I don't want to be this person. I don't want to anger disappoint and terrify those close to me anymore. I don't want to lose anyone else. I don't want to die.

This journey to sobriety is not an easy one. You stumbled and fell. Now you pick yourself up dust yourself off and get back on the path. ..You say that it was premeditated. What plans do you have in place to help next time?..
I don't know how many hundreds of times I've told myself enough is enough.  Destroyed relationships totaled car felony charge...Wtf is it going to take? How can I be so powerless over this one thing? It's time to take it out our hands. I keep thinking or being too stubborn to really find help. But maybe just a bit of hope. I must find help and maybe you'll be able to also. Please take care.
I'm sorry about your relapse and I'm sorry you woke up in hospital - that sounds terrifying. I remember waking up with no memory of what I'd done too many times to count and often being too afraid to piece together the night before because I didn't want to find out what fucked up things I'd done.  I don't have to be that person any more and I love it. I love waking up guilt free. I know you can get to that place too! Good luck I am rooting for you!
