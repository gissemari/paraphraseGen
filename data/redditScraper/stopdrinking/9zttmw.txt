After finding this subreddit two months ago I had my first relapse last Sunday then again Tuesday and today I've cleaned up after the pity party and requested my badge reset--back to day 3. ..I've long accepted that I have an addictive personality with my two most debilitating vices being alcohol and marijuana...Over the years they've vied for supremacy as I would lean on one to cut back on the other...Alcohol has been the thing to hurt me the most it's the thing I want out of my life for good. That said I was completely sober the first month before I fell back into the pattern of light toking which quickly escalated to former tolerance thresholds kinda being back under a fog all the time but at least I wasn't drinking...Last weekend after squandering two days getting high on my couch I was pretty disgusted with my internal refrain that at least I'm not drinking. Then I end up at the grocer in front of the alcohol section debating internally for half hour whether I shall grant this cheat day...Because I wanted to feel and have happen what I knew what was going to happen after I got home with the six-pack. I would drink it quickly as possible welcoming the quenching oblivion that was about to take hold when I could pass out and skip over those excruciating hours of remorseful reflection at day's end..Introspecting how I was feeling and to what degree I thought about getting high or drunk and how that ebbed and flowed over two months I think I've answered for myself whether right now I can still smoke marijuana while I resolve to not drink but I'm curious to learn how others have faced the dilemma of supplanting one addiction with another...I'm sad and a bit disappointed for not being able to control my vices and sometimes get really perplexed with not being able to come to grips with what is happening to brain/body that I feel at the mercy of alcohol or thc and while I hold steadfast to one-day-at-a-time I get really maudlin thinking about whether I would never be able to a enjoy the company of conversation abetted with a lovely spliff.

I transferred my addiction from alcohol to weed. What has worked for me is completely quitting both getting support in my sobriety (on here in therapy and from AA) and working a program of recovery (AA for the win on that one.) My badge represents days sober from both...What I've come to understand is that for me a drug is a drug. They both served the same purpose and I couldn't control my use of either. I can't moderate my weed use any more than I could drink moderately...Weed was basically a harm reduction strategy for me and while it wasn't as dangerous or physically damaging I still managed to fuck up quite a bit of my life and wreck my head while using it...Getting support in my sobriety has helped tremendously. I'm a lot happier now that I'm completely sober and getting support. I wouldn't want to go back to using either even if I could.
