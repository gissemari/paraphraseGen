In the past I've had a lot of drinking issues related to self medicating my emotional dysregulation caused by ADHD. I had a bad episode of drinking after a bad reaction to an antidepressant which brought my life a whole lot of pain and misery which lasted for weeks on even after quitting (Agomelatine). I'm not saying it's a bad antidepressant but it just didn't work out for me...I basically hit a brick wall. It was the 10th or so time I had to call the suicide hotline. I thought I will never recover and have permanently damaged my capacity to live my life to it's fullest...Alcohol was also involved in my 3 suicidal episodes of which I still have traumatic memories of and it has torn many relationships apart in my life causing me doubt about others and inability to connect with others socially...It's now been 2 months 2 months of well not complete abstinence but a real attempt at stopping...I find myself FINALLY being able to take the full brunt of immediate responsibilities in life...I found myself a partner with whom I've shared precious moments with and I'm starting to learn how to connect with people again...I just feel so much better. I posted here earlier feeling like my life was a total wreck 2 months ago but now I feel alive!..I hope in the midst of all the seemingly hopeless posts out here that this will help some of you to understand that even though you may be absolutely sure that your life will always remain a disaster that there is no such thing as alcohol fades away from your life and once you start reaching for your goals...It takes a bit of work take it slow but you'll get there not in years but in just a few months if you have the same history of drinking as I (6-18 drinks per weekend got to a point I was drinking every day 2 months ago for 3 weeks)...I wish you all the best and I understand if it's hard but please for the sake of yourself just push through it. (Trust your healthcare and doctors!)..One day you may wake up and feel this serenity. The struggle has finally ended.
