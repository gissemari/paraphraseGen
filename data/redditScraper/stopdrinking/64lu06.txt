It's only day 3 and although I've made it through the day I'm really struggling with the thought of not drinking. I've kept myself busy today but the temptation to go to the shop and buy wine was horrendous. I just don't know how I can keep this up.

Guess what people here know what you're talking about. You're not alone. Listen to them. Those girls and boys that have 3 figure 4 figure numbers. You can do it sis/bro. 
You're in the thick of it right now. Day 3 is no joke! You're doing great just focus on the rest of the day. It may seem silly but cramming my face with candy is how I made this far. ..Good luck! Stay strong I won't drink with you. 
It will get better with each passing day although sometimes it felt like a roller coaster ride...In the beginning I had to hang on for an hour at a time. Hang in there!
