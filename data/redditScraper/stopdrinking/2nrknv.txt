Seems like lots of people get sober in the aftermath of Thanksgiving. wonder why?..90 days to 33 years celebrated today - and some had really struggled to get there.  Here are some of the [chips](http://i.imgur.com/3ED53ma.jpg?1)..The V^2 is for a high school physics teacher who celebrated 25.   She said it proved she was indeed special.  She was laughing as she said this...It can be done no matter how impossible it seems.  No matter what our inner addicts tell us.  Just don't drink today...Meeting lasted a while but nobody minded.  ..
