I haven't got drunk this December. I had half a glass of Cava on the 15th December so I reset but I have predominately been sober this festive period. My first ever post in this sub was this time two years ago. I remember that I posted here saying that I wasn't drinking wine alone that night for the first time in forever and it felt so alien. It doesn't feel alien or weird now. Whole weekends can pass without me drinking and I don't think anything of it. ..But now it's Christmas and I keep thinking that I want a drink. I keep thinking that I will inevitably slip up some time in the next week. I have friends to meet up with Christmas day dinner New Years Eve....it's going to be really hard. ..Every time I think about having a drink I get the thought immediately after of how it will end. I ate too much yesterday and spent the night with stomach cramps (I sure know how to binge on food) and the thought of it being sickness from a hangover was enough to keep me dry last night. I am struggling to plan because the only plan I can think of is staying in alone and not seeing anyone for the week. ..I will not drink with you today...&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;

Drinking a bottle or two alone I can relate to a bad habit I've indulged in for years.  I've had several setback this year however have made significant progress in changing my drinking habits.  Surprisingly I had a few glasses at Thanksgiving and a couple with Christmas Dinner with the office folks two nights ago without stopping on the way home to grab another bottle...The holidays are tough I feel your pain.  Each day I ask myself around the wine hour time if I want to sabotage my next day.  This usually brings me around.  Good luck and I will not drink with you today.
That's what I'm doing- staying alone.  No company no parties not making a big dinner where I would usually start drinking in the morning as soon as I started cooking.  No New Year's plans.  My husband and I are going to the movies on Christmas day and we'll have something simple for dinner.  That's the only way I know how to protect my quit.  Good luck to you!  IWNDWYT
