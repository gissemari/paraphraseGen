That title got your attention right!? haha.Guys.not only am I on day 4 - I have gone 4 days with zero ZERO eating disordered behaviors. THATS HUGE damn near unheard of. I can't wait to go back to my old home group meeting tonight - It's been years. I just wanted to give a shout out to everyone especially those who also struggle with eating disorders. I'm hopeful for recovery.

Awesome great job on both things!
I'm glad it's eating disorder!  When I saw the acronym several things came to mind.  "Emergency Department" is one but *there are others!*   ;D
Nice work congrats!
