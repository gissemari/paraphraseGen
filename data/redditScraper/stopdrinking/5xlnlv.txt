Thinking about the last few months seems unreal. Before I quit I struggled to even make it 2 months. And when I say struggle I really mean it. Back then I only quit because I was arrested. ..Yet here I am making massive strides with hardly any trouble. For this I owe it to the simplistic thing. Deciding to be better. ..Once I broke down and came to terms that drinking wasn't doing me any favors even though I thought it helped me temptation almost completely disappeared. I don't crave alcohol anymore because I detest what comes along with it. Pain delusion depression regret all intensified and absolutely no desire to change. ..I used to have no aspirations and had no idea what to do with my time when I wasn't drinking. I think this is one of the things that made quitting so daunting at first. It felt like losing the only thing I had going for me. ..In reality choosing sobriety has opened so many doors I never knew were RIGHT there. It legitimately brings tears to my eyes thinking about how long these doors have been literally just sitting there right in front of my face completely in reach. I always knew these doors exsisted somewhere but when I was drinking I never thought I was deserving enough smart enough or just generally thought that my chance to ever find these doors was long gone due to my past. ..I now have enough trust in myself to have the confidence to see the bigger picture. I know I'm not a fuck up. I've made some mistakes yes but we've all had our fair share. The future is bright and friendly when before I feared I would someday end up homeless and alone. ..I welcome life to rush over me and fill me with emotion. I will learn to feel. I will learn to cope in healthy ways. I will progress and I will NOT make the same mistakes twice. I will keep trying. I will be content and I will be free.
