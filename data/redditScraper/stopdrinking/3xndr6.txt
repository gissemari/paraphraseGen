Hey sobernauts ..Posting this to take ownership of my year sober. It's such a miracle it doesn't even feel real yet. I've learned so much and grown so much. Three hundred and sixty eight days ago I couldn't imagine being sober for a week. Today sobriety is my new normal. ..A word of advice: if something isn't working make a change. For about seven months of my sobriety I was not going to meetings. At the end of that time I was struggling. I felt hopeless. Getting back to AA and finding a sponsor probably stopped me from relapsing. If you've been unhappy in sobriety ask for help it really could save your life. ..Preachy bit over I'm going to wrap things up. Thank you all for being here for me for writing posts and responding in the IRC. Every person here is a blessing I have love for you all. Stay strong and know that nobody who comes here has to go at this alone. ..With love ..Entboarder out.
