My brain today was telling me that's it's ok to relapse  you can just get sober again. Fortunately earlier hindsight was able to push through and reminded me how hard it is to get sober... how emotionally painful physically painful amd debilitating both drinking and detoxing is. So happy I'm still sober!!!  Now time to go to bed and spend hours trying to sleep :p

Mine was doing the same thing. 
Yeah I've really had to talk myself out of getting a drink tonight.  Ugh. Going to bed sober though and I'm glad.  
I've had one of those days as well!!! Our puppy wasn't feeling well and the resulting afternoon tried my patience just a bit but I have been stoked from the time that I woke up on having completed four sober weeks yesterday so I've clung to that and my best recollection of the most recent hangover and managed to muscle through. Now at bedtime the puppy dog seems to be feeling much better and I am crashing feeling strong and looking forward to a clear head in the morning!!!..**IWNDWYT.**
Oh yeah that sounds familiar. My brain would say you've been sober for this many days you deserve a beer! ???? Yeah that makes zero sense but don't let your old habits fool you. And no one wants to start back at zero! I won't drink with you tonight :)
I can relate - my fabulous plan to spend time this arvo having a picnic with sober friends and Kiddo fell apart and kiddo headed off to play at the pool after lunch after me being boring working Mummy all morning and I'm like - ah fuck it - why not a glass of wine... so went and saw a friend who doesn't drink at all instead and had a yarn and a laugh and adult conversation for an hour - feeling much better. on the iced tea. glad I didn't cave in.
