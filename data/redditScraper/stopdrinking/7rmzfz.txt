 Drunkenness is temporary suicide. ..As someone who has struggled with suicidal urges as long as I can remember the fact that I've also struggled with blackout binge drinking since I was a early teenager makes sense. .I really want to drink today but I won't. I will lose everything if I do.

Bertrand Russell a fine mind indeed
For me drinking is a slow suicide nothing less. Within a period of months it would become a permanent one.
