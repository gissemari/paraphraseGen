In my job I go to a lot of social events (I'm in sales) and a big part of that is forming relationships with business partners in a social setting...I've just returned from a two day conference with the usual split of proper presentations and business stuff in the daytime then drinks dinner and more drinks in the evening...Here's the thing: my default position nowadays is not to drink. So while the beer and wine are flowing my order at the bar is a Sprite. I navigate the "not drinking tonight?" with a straightforward "I don't drink". It rarely goes further than that...Dinner is wine wine wine; waiting staff keeping everyone topped up. I stick to water...Then it's back off to the bar at 10pm. Or for me it's time for bed. I may do one more drink just to be social but generally I stop before the real debauchery starts...I'm not pious about it - getting upset or annoyed by people being drunk. How can I be? What good would that do anyone?..This morning I woke up at my usual time felt refreshed had a shower had breakfast (and unlike some others didn't struggle to keep it down ;-)). I vicariously enjoyed the tales of 4am finishes and expensive taxi rides back to the hotel. I gave leeway to the people who arrived later in the morning looking worse for wear...I don't miss that. I don't feel like I'm missing out either...I can say with a good degree of confidence that I'm totally over that lifestyle. I'm effective (I was presenting today) engaged in the day and not regretting talking shit through the bottom of a glass the night before...Stay cool SD.

Loved reading this! I've got my first business trip in June and I'm trying not to get worried ahead of time. 
I love this story.  Thanks for sharing.  I won't drink with you today.
