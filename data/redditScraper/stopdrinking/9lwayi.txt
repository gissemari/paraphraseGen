I was close to a relapse on tuesday thank you SD I did not drink. I am terrified I will come to that point again especially now that my rehab has ended and Im going back to work on monday. Ive cut down at work because work has also been a major reason why Ive used alcohol. Along with this lovedrama with my bf. I have no idea how to deal with this so it wont make me drink in the future so if someone would like to read and see solvations please share with me. ..Reason to why I was close to relapsing on tuesday was partly because I had a fight with my boyfriend who I live with because he was writing with this girl who he in the beginning of our relationship had feelings for and we ended up breaking up for a while because of this. He did not realise his feelings at first I made him realise them they were not mutual we ended up back together a while further. They were not friends for a time but he eventually forgave her and they have this OK friendship now more shallow and not as intense. I however never forgave her she did some mean stuff to him and was unrespectful towards him. Also I never handled my feelings about the whole thing because when it hurt I drank...So here we are one year later Im sober and trying to deal with this among other things. Still it hurts when I see they are talking I get angry and then feel guilty because I am angry and not trusting my bf even after all this time. I want to be OK with it I want them to be able to have a friendship they have been friends for years before me and my bf met. But I understand that it is a threat against my sobrerity and we cant think about whats right or wrong right now. My sobrerity goes first. I could try reading everything they talk about but that feels wrong. He could talk to her in secret so I dont have to know but that feels wrong. They could take a break and not talk for a while but that feels wrong too. And I cant think of one good explanation to give her about why to take a break. We could also just keep going as it is and hope that I will handle next situation better since Im also working on myself and my feelings. But what if I still wont be able to handle it. What if I come home from a hard day at work when Im already close to a relapse and find them talking? That makes me terrified. ..To sum it up: I am scared that unhandled lovedrama with my bf will make me drink again and I dont know what to do.

You show remarkable insight into how this is making you feel...I found that as time went on I learned how to trust my coping mechanisms. ..What if you trusted yourself?
