I stayed sober for almost 5 months and my divorce destroyed me. But I log in every day. It does help and hoping for the best result doesn't make you weak. It is probably the only thing that will bring you back. So don't stop  
May I ask what's going through your mind right now that's causing you to feel this way?..I will not drink with you today or tomorrow. 
Get my support comrade! Still it scary me. So many days passed according your badge and still a struggle is real? What a mess I trapped in =\
