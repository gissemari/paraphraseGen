Good morning /sd! ..Welcome to the first WuW of the lovely month of December! [You know what day it is right](http://makeameme.org/media/created/Brace-Yourselves-The-76k9mc.jpg)?..For a lot of us the opening games of the Holiday Olympics are just fading in the rear-view mirror and we've got office parties  gift exchanges and all kind of festivities staring us down from the middle of the road ahead. Let's do this together! Share your struggles triumphs and a general chat. ..**Triumph**: I made it through the Thanksgiving holiday sober and present even though my carefully laid plans pretty much evaporated. I enjoyed myself and I feel great knowing that I rose to that challenge...**Struggle**: My December calendar is packed and I'm already catching myself stressing out about not having enough "down time." I used to force myself to chill out and recharge by turning off my phone drawing the curtains and getting drunk. I know that will do the opposite of recharge me but I'm remembering how enticing it is to just escape and isolate for a day or two. ..**General Chat**: I'm looking forward to decorating the house for Christmas this year. It's something I've totally let slide in the past but this year I'll at least do a tree and some lights. It's cheesy yeah but it makes me happy and I'll take anything I can get. ..What's going on with you guys?
----------immediate responses--------

It's also time for the tree over here! And this weekend I'm volunteering Friday and Saturday...and most exciting of all Sunday I'm meeting with a rescue organizing about serving as a foster home for dogs that are being abandoned during the holidays. I've been missing dogs since mine died last summer and I'm so happy to be in a place where I would truly be a responsible and present foster parent for dogs in need!
Triumph- today is day 23 for me which is the longest I've ever gone sober. Ever. I started using a drugs and alcohol at 17. I'm 27 now...Struggle- everything else. I should be happy but I'm not. I'm in a sullen mood I stay up at night thinking about missed opportunities and lost time. I don't have any rehabilitation program I'm involved in. I haven't made any changes in my life other than avoiding drinking and partying atmospheres and attending a few sporadic meetings without working the program. I feel like I'm on my own. I want this to be a permanent change and not a temporary one but I have no one to hold me accountable other than myself. I could ramble about this for hours.
**Triumph** The big move to Toronto is coming together nicely. Spending lots of time with my husband. Going to miss that dude....**Struggle** We've got thousands of dollars of expenses related to my schooling this month. My husband keeps reminding me we're investing in our future but I really dislike spending big amounts of cash. Gives me the heeby-jeebies....**General Chat** Finally some snow in Ottawa!!!!
**Triumph:** I'm almost done my Christmas shopping! I was always a last minute guy and would get all stressed about it so it's nice to almost ready with a few weeks to go...**Struggle:** Work isn't going so well the company has had a horrible past 18 months. They just made some big changes in management in hopes of turning things around. Fingers crossed that things start to look up in 2015...**General Chat:** I've been trying to treat myself with the money I've saved from not drinking. My conservative estimate is about $5500... that's a lot of money to piss away. As a result it's 3 weeks tomorrow until I go to Costa Rica!! 
**Triumph:** I planned a 12 month budget with more limited income meeting all of my minimum payments.  .  .**Struggle:** The fall out from a co-workers attempted suicide that due to medical reasons might still become successful. I am a forced entrant in this circus :(  .  .**General Chat:** I budgeted ice cream into my December's budget; because feels are strong but Americone Dream is stronger.
Triumph: Last night I made it through weekly pub trivia with my friends while having iced tea! Another triumph was sitting in a smoke filled area for 2 hours and not having a cigarette either!..Struggle: Instead of taking things one day at a time I can't stop thinking of all the family holiday parties I have lined up and how to approach the subject of "Hey I know I was a mess on Thanksgiving but I'm sober now!" ..General Chat:  I'm a cross-stitcher and I'm thinking of sewing tea towels with various Santas/Candy Canes/ holiday themed figures for loved ones. Does anyone else hand make things for gifts?

Hi...Triumph: I passed the second of three tests I need to pass in order to transfer my credential. I did *not* drink to celebrate...Struggle: The upcoming drinking festivities and general loneliness. Every one of my friends is a heavy drinker and I've been isolating myself since the beginning of last month trying to cut down and now stopping completely. How do you make friends in your 40s?..General Chat: I love all the twinkly lights. I may decorate my place even though I'm the only one who will enjoy them. The festivity is heartwarming.
**Triumph:**  I got a new better gym membership and I haggled a lower price! I feel like an adult!..**Struggle:** Needed to reset my badge again.  Been stressed with the work/school/personal life balance.  I like being this busy but I let my support drop.  Feeling moody and depressed...**General Chat:**  Just accidentally blasted "ALLEN CARRS EASY WAY TO CONTROL ALCOHOL" via my phone speakers to the whole office.  Ooops.  More support? ha ha heh. 
**Triumph:** Hosted my first dinner party since getting sober. When I passed him a beer a friend ask "You're not having one? Is that part of the being healthy we were talking about?" And that was that. [Remember that its all in your head.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UclCCFNG9q4)..**Struggle:** It's the quiet moments that get me. As friends were leaving there was a second where I was the only one in the house and looking at a couple beers. That nasty little voice whispered "Grab them!"..**Chat:** Sobriety hasn't improved my grinchy bah-humbug attitude. I don't like the stress and family issues the holidays bring. I'll cope relax and enjoy what I can.
**Triumph**:  My dad came to visit for a full week and I stayed a sober host! We ended up doing a bunch of active things - running (including my first 5k race) hiking mini-golf batting cages nature walk through a state park shopping trying new restaurants etc. It's the most time we've spent together in years and I'm so happy I didn't squander it being drunk or hungover...**Struggle**: I kicked off Thanksgiving by taking a drink from a water glass and realizing too late it was a leftover gin and tonic from the night before. I was freaking out for a couple minutes but I chugged a bunch of water and decided to let it go. Lesson learned. Unidentified liquids are not to be trusted!..**General**: I just made my first crockpot dish and I'm in love. Anybody have a kickass recipe?
**Triumph:** This year I am *ahead* in all my classes. My journal responses and papers are on their way to being typed out. Finals will be somewhat easy for me all because I decided to work on them!! It's crazy how much time I thought I didn't have now that I'm not hungover or partying all during finals week. ..**Struggle.** Relationship stuff as always. My boyfriend is in the program. He's *rigorously honest* to the point where my feelings are never spared. When he's upset about something had a long day whatever he'll sit there and go over what a burden I am because I don't have a car. He'll tell me how codependent I am how I am ungrateful usually these conversations start happy and lighthearted but they go bad fast. For example he picked me up from school yesterday he had a bad day at work we talked about work for a bit we start laughing at each other he tells me he can't wait until I have a car I agree he says we will finally be independent. That he will be able to do whatever the fuck he wants that I'll be able to get around and stop being so fucking codependent. It devolved so fast. It continued like that all night. I set up his video game while he was in the shower because I knew it would help him relax he walks in and says "Wow that's some serious ass kissing. What do you want? You always want something." I didn't react the way he wanted when he was being self-conscious so he refused to cuddle/snuggle/touch me. ..**General Chat.** I don't really have anything. I feel like crap this week. haha. 
**Triumph:** I am sober 6 days now even though I am going through an incredibly dire situation that has few options with many avenues of failure and destruction...**Struggle:** Homelessness in a rural area that has very cold winters is well difficult - especially without a phone.  The days offer some shelter but the nights are a looming anxiety and sometimes a brutal chill.  I finally appreciate the meanings of hunger and thirst though I've been lucky enough to find some resources.  How surreal and stressful the situation is seems to be sustaining and pushing me so far but it's only a matter of time before I collapse or feel like giving up...My lifelong friend is becoming increasingly frustrated at most everything in the world and although I've done no wrong against him the relationship is strained due to his resentful abrasive demeanor.  It's difficult to not think that my current problems are "worse" or "larger than" his and that I could really use some support rather than brooding mentions of his problems and how ineffectual his warnings and cares were in previous months and years (concerning my alcoholism) but... I've got to let it be: it is what it is.  I can only imagine how it is to love someone as a brother but see them fall to extreme depths anyway.  It's a difficult thing and he just may be at his ends in terms of ability or understanding or learning to offer any warmth while he is going through his own annoyances...After getting in a physical fight with my father that ended in my arrest the relationship may take years to recover if ever it does.  It's difficult not to pile this occasion as a new addition to the already large pile of dirt.  The court proceedings are postponing my ability to go to a detox and rehabilitation center which is quite an annoyance...**General Chat:** When you read is that voice your own or some other's or just a matter of comprehension?.
Triumph: I made it through the last 44 days including a brutal work xmas party. Feel like I'm figuring out more and more about myself and this journey every day. Got a sponsor. Been open/honest about quitting drinking with more and more people. ..Struggle: Stressed with passport applications and drivers licenses. Found out I have to wait 8 months to move up from my learners permit to the actual driving license. I've been super pumped about getting it within the next month or two. That was a downer. ..General Chat: New episode of Serial tomorrow! 
**Triumph**: Life is good: tennis family friends ... \o/..**Struggle**: I've got nothing...**General Chat**: Is it Springtime yet?  I miss dry tennis courts on a cool fall evening under the lights.
**Triumph:** First sober trip to a pub for food. It was a pre-planned meet with a helpfully teetotal friend. I had a pint of apple juice and didn't even consider alcohol which didn't appeal at all...**Struggle:** Continuing peer pressure on the internet about how I should 'just' cut back or something. But I'm rejecting it all mentally thankfully...**General Chat:** I feel like shit this week low mood possibly due to the fallout from my last ever drinking session or a cold.
**Triumph** - went out to the detox facility and just hung out with some junkies and drunks.  It felt really good to be the message and just show 'em wassup.  It helped.  ..BECAUSE.  .**Struggle** - I found this dudes needles and dope in my car before work and had to kick him out of my house.  Dude doesn't seem to get that I'm not mad at him I'm mad at the fact he couldn't talk to me about his desire to use or how he felt like he had no option but to self-medicate (he got drunk too)... but whatever... It's been a real struggle because I am FINALLY starting to feel empathy after months of Anhedonia from dope and booze.  .  .**General Chat**......  Stay vigilant.  Thank you for letting me vent.
Triumph: I'm at 2.5 weeks sober.. in that time period i got a large raise at work &amp; a very positive evaluation at a job i've only had a few months i was planning to stay single for a long time to facilitate sobriety but i had a spontaneous "meet-cute" at the supermarket with a high school acquaintance and went on a date that night did NOT feel any triggers to drink in fact the date was incredibly wholesome and felt like high school &amp; had a great thanksgiving was offered a drink that i turned down and spent a few hours cozy by the fireplace hanging with my awesome fam both of my sisters are pregnant and found out today that one is having a girl! rid myself of last person i was dating who was a loser made me feel like crap &amp; triggered me to drink something fierce lastly-planning an almost free trip to Hawaii in a few months! ok that's enough.. that was a ramble...Struggle: I struggle with compulsive behavior and thus my finances are always iffy. I have great credit and always pay my bills but i have a hard time saving because i love buying random crap. This month i had unforeseen $ to shell out plus got the devil flu and had medical bills so i am pretty much unable to afford much of anything for christmas for anyone will be broke until January. i am also planning to sell my home and buy another so kind of getting stressed thinking about how stressful that will be haha. ..general: i'm mostly happy for the first time in quite a while. i made huge life changes over the summer and i am learning they were for the better. things are looking up!
