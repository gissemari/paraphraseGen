So I've come to a crossroads.  I can't do this anymore. I get clean for weeks then go on a bender that screws  everything up. Today needs to be my last. I love a mid morning buzz and I don't know why. If I can't get control this time I'm giving up. My son and wife deserve a better man. I'm tired of feeling sad and like shit. If today isn't my last drink I honestly don't know I'll do. I've failed at life since I was a kid. Both my biological parents abandoned me. I've always struggled with undiagnosed mental illnesses. I need to go to a counselor but I'm not good at opening up. I really hope this morning was my last drink or I may just give up on life.

Never give up!  You are worth fighting for.  It helps me if I read books about alcohol addiction stock my house with sparkling water get some sweet treats and keep coming here.  IWNDWYT
Don't do that. Have you read this naked mind?  If not. Do it. I felt like you describe. I had had enough I had the gift of desperation l. Do you?  90 meetings in 90 days getting a good sponsor and faithfully and fearlessly working the steps has saved my life. I feel better than I ever have.   It's better over here if you're willing to work for it. I had to stop making excuses and get to work with the guidance of people that had what I wanted. ..IWNDWYT
Please do not give up. I've been through some very dark times and the one thing that kept me going was my children. Please keep your child in mind when you are struggling.  Sending good vibes your way.
There's a lot of support available...Tried free recovery meetings?
