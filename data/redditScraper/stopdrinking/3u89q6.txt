Since our families are the ones who installed our buttons it makes perfect sense that they can push them with such precision...**Instead of taking it personally this year take notes - and post below.**  ..Maybe it's your brother Steve who has unlocked a new level of asshole now that he is a  brewmaster  and his craft beer won some sort of competition - and he's trying to get you to drink it.   Just taste it  he says - again and again ..Maybe it's your mother who has you seated next to Aunt Millie who doesn't drink either but who is deaf and keeps asking when are you going to get married? ..Maybe it's the flight that got delayed and the only place to sleep is in a booth at the airport bar...Maybe it's going home and seeing they still haven't got the stain out of the carpet from two years ago when ..Or Maybe your dad tells you he's got a Trump for President button you can wear.  ..Maybe gasp you are hosting and your SO does not understand why you are asking them to make sure the sex toys are deeply buried because one of the guests has a five year old whose little hands get into *everything* and you don't want him playing unicorn.....Whatever it is - **save it - post it** - and a panel of judges from Dinosaurs In Recovery will read - and on occasions of exceptional valor (or extreme stupidity on the part of others) award Reddit gold.  (Others can too for that matter this is real life nobody is in charge.)  ..Remember what may not be funny to you at the time - will often be laughable later.  And **by posting it here you get the last laugh and not a relapse .**.

I'm home on lunch break. I just stuffed my turkey with a granny smith celery carrrot onion sage thyme and fresh rosemary and 3 bay leaves. It is in a foil pan with a can of broth in there too. In 2 hours when I have my 3pm break I will be back here and putting it in the oven. Tonite around 7:30 sucker will be done and a heavy weight will be lifted off tomorrow's worries. :)
In laws are here.  Two awesome conversations so far:..Conversation #1.MIL:  "I got Trump for president.".Me:  "Seriously?".MIL:  "Yup.  Definitely not Ben Carson.  He has no experience."..Conversation #2.Me:  "Mainstream media makes it so hard to separate fact from opinion.".MIL:  "Yeah.  They need to put a cap on the media; I don't care what the constitution says!"
Seriously fuck Steve.

For about a minute my dad shook his cocktail shaker so close to my ear it was basically bouncing off my head. ..I'm not drinking tonight but I may run over the shaker with my car. 
I have a mother who insists that I'm drinking again because "A mother knows".....Luckily I'm Canadian and we don't have a family holiday this weekend! ..Happy Sober holidays to my American friends you can do this its easy.

My partner and I always host a thanksgiving dinner at our place for any friends who are stuck in town or don't have a place to go.  I have to say every year it's a nice way to spend the day!
At a bar getting wings with my husband and his entire family. Drinking soda and doing alright while everyone else has beers... Husband's brother keeps calling for shots. Definitely tested my willpower.
Went to see my friend's band play tonight. Got a giant coffee from Caseys. People who didn't know I quit drinking yet kept looking at the cup I was holding like "Man Brandon's not drinking tonight. Is he pregnant? No no he's a dude. Why's he being a weirdo then?" Being in a bar started to get to me and my friend and I left a little early. Feels preeetty good. 
Just an observation- my Facebook feed is full of people already having mimosas. Am I only just noticing this bullcrap because I'm not drinking? How could you have a mimosa for breakfast and not spend the rest of the day and evening drinking? My alcoholic brain does not get it.
My brother already texted me asking if 9am was too early for a beer. 4 months 7 days sober I responded with YES. Challenged him to go be productive fuck alcohol. He responded with "not for me"   .So affirmed in my choice not to drink today. 
Got my [bulletproof response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRpnDxHXiDY) ready. Happy Thanksgiving soberinos!
TIL from my hippie cousin that alcoholism isn't real its all in my head. All I have to do is connect with my higher self and allow it to control me and I won't have negative urges anymore. Once I do that having a drink won't be an issue **ever again**! She could change the world if she would share that with all of the alcolics/addicts out there! Also I need to take psychedelics regularly so I can open my mind to its true potential. ..I think I'll just stick with AA and SD instead though. 
my grandfather in law keeps joking about me being pregnant bc i'm refusing to drink. He's making a joke of it. 
My ex-husband's mother sat me at the "kids table" then continuously offered me Welch's Sparkling Grape juice; each time reminding me that it's alcohol free. .Gee thanks. 
Got asked by a family friend "Are you still doing that *not drinking* thing? Cause I can get your favorite holiday beer cheaper I know people this year."..Umm...Yeah.  I know people too.  People who don't drink...555 days...and counting.  ..
Surprisingly pleasant (if hectic) day in the Batcave.  I was always the heavy drinker passed out drunk about 6 usually.  This year we hosted as usual with 12 people in attendance and only my Son-In-Law drank.  But he's a moderate drinker.  He only brought a 6 pack and brought the leftovers home with him.  Just the fact that there were leftover beers from a six pack kinda blows my alcoholic mind!..The Step-Son who's usually a bit of a jerk during holidays was pleasant and polite to everyone. Very happy about that!..Just the fact that I wasn't sloppy drunk was a pleasant surprise for all of my family even though they all know I don't drink anymore...And no Unicorns appeared!!    
Hosted my parents who are very much wine enthusiasts. Despite telling them that I'm an alcoholic they often offer me glasses of wine. Well today I stuck with my lemon soda water and had to help manage my tipsy mother in the kitchen while we cooked everything. ..Not that I didn't enjoy their company but I'm happy I didn't drink. I had just as much fun playing games with them as I ever had and I will feel great tomorrow. 
No one said anything about my lack of drinking which was cool... I mainly got the "you look so good! what have you been doing?" comments which are always appreciated...But my cousin got gradually drunker throughout the day which culminated in him trying to get me to try bacon bourbon "just for the taste" and somehow forgetting that he'd previously told me how god-awful it was. My sister was shocked that he tried to make me try it. THEN he drunkenly told me I was an inspiration to him in his efforts to drink less. I'm glad I can inspire someone but it's kind of weird to hear that from a currently-very-drunk-person...
I knew it was time to go when all my cousins were talking about was whether or not to oil their AR-15 rifles.
I'm still so pleasantly surprised at how much easier thanksgiving was sober! It's typically a shitshow because my family is made up of very very heavy drinkers. And we would get into these intense political/social conversations that would devolve into tears and yelling matches. And I almost always left crying and a little broken-hearted that my otherwise intelligent and caring family could be so close minded. (I'm the one bleeding heart liberal in a sea of very conservative folks). ..This year the same things were said that would normally get me all fired up. BUT I WAS DIFFERENT! sobriety does wonders for discretion and I just bit my tongue and reminded myself that I have never once successfully gotten a member of my family to just listen and consider my point of view and that the dead horse has been beaten enough. ..The highlight reel of comments that make my skin itchy:.- not every Muslim is a terrorist but every terrorist is Muslim.- if black lives mattered then they wouldn't put themselves in situations where they are killed by police.- gays should just be thankful that they're safe in America. Why do they need marriage too! It's unnatural! (I'm out as a lesbian to my freaking family!).- racism does not exist in America. Classes do not exist in America. If you do not succeed in America the country where it's possible for anyone to pull themselves up by their bootstraps it's because you are lazy. .- Being told by my newlywed father that he wants to spend Christmas in MN with his wife and her boys and that we're not invited this year. .- angry rants from my father about how my mother turned me into an alcoholic for being such an abusive drunk during my childhood ignoring the fact that my alcoholic father was also present during my childhood yet never once stopped my mom from beating on us even if he was in the room!..Anyway I'm going to end my rant because I could go on forever. Disappointing politics aside I DID have a nice day with my family. Oh how sobriety makes everything easier. 
I worked on Thanksgiving. We're seeing the first wave of holiday alcoholics come in to the hospital so I processed a lot of withdrawal and GI bleed orders. It's sad but also a good reminder. ..I met my parents at a diner after. Didn't think about it at the time but it was a good choice since there's no alcohol served. I even managed to change the topic of conversation once it went down the line from France to the original reign of terror and back to the current president "sharpening his guillotine." Both of them have hearing loss and have no idea how loud they are. They also don't seem to care that fellow diners may not want to hear about beheadings over dinner...I escaped in due time and was struck by how thankful I was that I didn't have to find the one liquor store still open on the way home. Yesterday I worked and today I decided to take a day for myself. My parents wanted me to come over but whether it was selfish or self-preservation I declined. I chose to have a lovely lazy day with my cat instead.
