Long time lurker here- but I figured I would come out of the shadows to celebrate my sober trip around the globe! :)  ..Honestly I owe it all to you guys.  I have been reading through all of your ups and downs and celebrated and struggled right along with all of you.  Thank you for your indirect encouragement and strength.  ..This year has had its ups and downs but I have really been able to come into my own and start living life right alongside everyone else.  So much in fact that I almost let my sober anniersary go by unnoticed.  One of my very dear friends actually brought it up today asking if this was my one year mark!..Tonight I raise a glass of seltzer water (cranberry lime) to all of you! IWNDWYT!
