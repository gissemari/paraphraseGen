I had a pretty gnarly relapse for about 10 days this past May but have been stopped again for exactly seven months today...I'm so happy to be sober. My last relapse was not enjoyable in the least. I thought it would be but it was just stressful and I felt like shit the entire time...When I think about drinking now I don't even understand how I did it for so long. I *knew* I would black out. I *knew* I would piss the bed. I *knew* they could smell it on me at work. I *knew* I needed professional help when I started carrying a plastic pint and airplane bottles with me 24/7 and had to take a couple gulps every 2 or 3 hours to make the shakes go away. But I didn't stop. I went on like that for years because I didn't know what else to do...Now I wake up in the morning and feel calm. When I lay down to sleep at night I feel calm. I don't wonder what I did the night before or the weekend before. I don't wonder if I've destroyed any relationships recently without realizing it...I have a little bit of self-respect back and I think (though I'm not sure) I've gotten some dignity back in the eyes of my loved ones...I eat well I exercise I call and text my Mom all the time instead of once every two or three months like I used to-- and when I call it's to say "I love you how are you?" instead of telling her a thousand lies to hide the piece of shit I really was and hoping at the end she'll offer me some money. I don't want or need their money anymore. I just want them to know I love them...In short I was sick and miserable and afraid of everything including myself but I'm not like that anymore. I look in the mirror and I get why my SO likes me. I think about my future and do not feel fear...Things are so much better now. I hope I never trick myself into drinking again...At least one thing's for sure though: I won't today.
