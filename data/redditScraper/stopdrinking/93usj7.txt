I have been struggling to stay sober since June 13. I managed 13 days in a row then have been on and off since then. Sometimes I'll make it 3 days in a row but I haven't managed to get into a rhythm with sobriety. I'm in a very rural area until after Labor Day and I don't drive so can't easily get to a meeting and my husband drinks so that is the temptation. In June I went into the hospital for alcohol withdrawal for 4 days. Had mild fatty liver and slightly elevated enzymes and was a shaking hungover mess for months before that every single day. I am always happy when I wake up knowing I didn't drink the night before. I have proved I can get through the urge but I need to keep it up for my health and my sanity. I always thought alcohol helped me manage my anxiety but when I don't drink I don't have anxiety at all. I always thought I had social anxiety and needed it for that but it turns out after experiencing sober nights out with other people drinking that I have no social anxiety at all. Alcohol is the biggest lie I ever believed in. I want to be free of it. .

Keep posting! you can do it!
Yep on the anxiety. I have a boatload of problems in my life but the anxiety of trying to deal with them is magnified by alcohol. In the past week I've stopped getting those striking pangs in my chest. Congrats on getting through day one.
