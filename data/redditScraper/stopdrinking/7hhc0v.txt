Hi r/stopdrinking been a lurker for a while now but decided to finally post. ..I made the decision that I wanted to cut out drinking from my life this year. I've made steps in the right direction but haven't fully given up yet. One of my main struggles at the moment is peer pressure - I live with three other guys who are constantly drinking. There's always alcohol in the house and their social life revolves around it. Any time they ask me to join them for a drink I accept but tell them im  not gonna drink - which they scoff at and decide to buy me booze. ..I can't get through to them that I think I've got issues with my drinking. They see it often as me trying to be melodramatic. I love these guys to death but I know that it's not cool on their part. What should I do?

&gt;I can't get through to them that I think I've got issues with my drinking..&gt;What should I do?..I can only speak for what I would do...I gave up trying to get anyone to "understand".  That's a fools errand.  "I don't understand why you don't drink" is code speak for "You're not doing what I want you to do so either change what you do or convince me".  ..I don't know about you but putting my energy into "convincing" anyone of anything is a waste of my time...They've already communicated loud and clear and consistently that they don't agree with your decisions: "they scoff and decide to buy me booze"...At some point I ask myself "Am I willing to have people in my life who do not treat me with respect with courtesy and scoff at me?"..When you arrive at whatever your answer is to that then you'll know what to do. ..Accept it the way it is or change something *about yourself*.
If they don't pretend you're being silly they'd have to be admit that their own drinking could also be classed as problematic. They are deeply invested in avoiding that so to protect themselves they have to ignore your boundaries and not take you seriously...I don't know how to deal with that--I can only suggest that understanding their motivation is based in fear not a genuine desire to disrespect you. Maybe that could help you "hold the truth" for yourself and feel less vulnerable to their votes over your personal truth. Their votes are no good; they haven't even familiarized themselves with the issue. No vote...It may feel lonely to separate your consciousness that way but it's already lonely to feel "unseen" and run roughshod over by friends. ..You can love them but you have to be loyal to what you know first and let the chips fall where they may. I'd skip the bar until you have a better sense of solidity with your decision and practice declining their pressure at home. You can gently call out their passive aggressive sabotage and how juvenile it is: "Dude LOL I'll get a beer for myself if I want one. I'm a big boy."..That might get them to mind their own business a little. :-(
