Hi sober friends- I just hit my 80 day mark! Not drinking is getting easier- I'm not experiencing cravings as much as I did the first month. I am struggling with motivation and slight depression. I'm trying to plow through it but it's been hard over the past few weeks- maybe the holidays have something to do with it. I'm thankful for this site- every time I am struggling I am always find a relative post that makes me feel better! Thanks SD!!!! Next goal is 100!

Hi there! Congratulations on 80 days. IWNDWYT  
I'd say the holidays have everything to do with it.  Everything in excess especially the booze.  Makes me nuts...80 Days is awesome.  Keep going!..IWNDWYT
Great job!  Keep it up. Remain vigilant and listen to your inner voice. There have been and will be trying times but you can overcome them. IWNDWYT!
Congratulations! I've had a hard few days and also hadn't been logging into here. Reading post here does help especially with motivation.
