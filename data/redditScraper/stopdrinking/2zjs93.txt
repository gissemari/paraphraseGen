Good Morning/Afternoon!..*Theme:* Fear..**"Have no fear of perfection - you'll never reach it." - [Salvador Dali](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/s/salvadorda161820.html?src=t_fear)**..*What I get from it:* [BE NOT AFRAID ME.](http://shirtoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/fear-nothing.jpg)  I have to keep this in mind every single day.  I have to remind myself that even when I am struggling it's ok - bc what I am after is [progress and a willingness](http://www.chasetheredgrape.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/quote-2.png) to try my best. [I am not after perfection](http://productivitygeek.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/quote-striving-for-excellence-motivates-you-striving-for-perfection-is-demoralizing-harriet-braiker-298517.jpg) because for me that is just an easy way to set myself up for failure.  Being OK with not being the very best and/or struggling to achieve perfection really helps me keep things in perspective and that helps me keep it going day by day.  As long as I am doing my best and willing to try it again tomorrow then I have succeeded.  And I can't do my best if I'm sitting around [fearful of everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P191zutE1D0).  I just have to get out there and do it to it friends....Have an awesome day!

"You may be 38 years old as I happen to be. And one day some great opportunity stands before you and calls you to stand up for some great principle some great issue some great cause. And you refuse to do it because you are afraid . You refuse to do it because you want to live longer . You're afraid that you will lose your job or you are afraid that you will be criticized or that you will lose your popularity or you're afraid that somebody will stab you or shoot at you or bomb your house; so you refuse to take the stand.  Well you may go on and live until you are 90 but you're just as dead at 38 as you would be at 90. And the cessation of breathing in your life is but the belated announcement of an earlier death of the spirit."..  Martin Luther King Jr...."And did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts? Hot ashes for trees?  Hot air for a cool breeze? Cold comfort for change? And ..did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?"..  Roger Waters
I'm putting this somewhere permanent.
Perfect! I was especially all-or-none go big or don't go at all so learning to not let *perfection* be the enemy of *excellent* or *good* has been beneficial. I'm not perfect just perfectly human and all the imperfections that go with it. It's not where I'm at but where I'm headed that counts. Every mistake is an opportunity to improve. My sponsor used to say: "The closest we come to perfection is that we identify out mistakes and correct them. That's what successful people do."
Perfect quote for me today! Okay... Not perfect but damn close :)
