&gt;"my feelings of shame and despair have been compounded and heightened. Maybe I'm being hard on myself but I really do feel haunted by the mistakes I've made."..I have had waves of this over the past 2 weeks but honestly it was mostly the first 7 days..I don't know if you are familiar with "The Promises" from AA but there is one that says something like "we will not regret the past nor wish to close the door on it" -  If you talk to sober people who have actually worked on their sobriety most seem to acknowledge that shame and regret can evaporate with the right work.  I'm going for it because for me the alternative sucks.  I plan on spending the rest of my life in a better space and there is no doubt in my mind that I CAN'T DO IT IF I DRINK.  Thank you for sharing it definitely takes courage.
Days 4-6 of my detox were absolutely the hardest. Overall I knew that the alcohol couldn't possibly make things better. You can still attend gallery openings and have a tonic water with lime etc. Who needs to know? I was spending just under $500/mo on my alcohol habit and now that money is in my bank account. Pulling through my detox helped me refocus on what mattered in my family friends and career. Hopefully you will see the same. Best wishes.
I totally feel your pain. I have terrible anxiety and used alcohol to control it. Just getting through the first few days is so crucial. It will get better. Hang in there and congrats on the 5 days! This is a great accomplishment.
I'm sorry sweet girl :(. I'm struggling too. I'm 33 alone and heart broken. My career is all I have and i am clutching it for dear life.  I have reached out to friends just to ask how they're doing. I'm lonely but I realize the only one left to protect me now is me. So I better get busy nourishing myself  ..Hugs.
