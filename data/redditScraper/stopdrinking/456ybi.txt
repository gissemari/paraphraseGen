About a week ago I had a full on mental breakdown after drinking and left my band. Then I binged through Thursday...I've been thinking about leaving the band. for a while. as it's been a constant source of anxiety for me for a long time. I kept having long stretches of sobriety followed by relapse at shows. I couldn't live like that anymore. Still I lost my crowning achievement over the past few years. And I know it will be better for my mental health but it's a weird transition...I wish it didn't happen like this. We were a month from touring I didn't want to tour and I basically let my guard down. Yesterday the car I bought about a week ago also died. Engine suddenly ceased without any symptoms...Having a tough time. I'm happy for the times to come though. I can't let it get worse than this.
