Two friends of mine who had been not drinking with me for the past year and some change just relapsed within days of each other this past week. For both of them it was a single drink of their respective drinks of choice followed by a pang of distaste and the mutual realization that in the last year they've developed an indifference to alcohol. Maybe they were sugar-coating the experience as they reflected on it to me but neither of them seem keen on making this a hard relapse and something about their experience and what was clarified for them comforts me in my own decision to stay sober. I feel void of any cravings of alcohol like I feel void of any craving I'd have to put my hand on a burning stove top.  My indifference to alcohol goes beyond a testament to sobriety at this point it seems almost like a biological response. I don't play around with the what ifs of whether or not I break my sobriety at this point it's simple enough to avoid. I don't miss it and if we can learn anything from the experience of my friends a relapse has nothing to offer me besides furthering my indifference to alcohol. IWNDWYT

&gt;&gt; a relapse has nothing to offer me..when you really think it through I think this is the heart of the matter. what does it REALLY bring to the table that is positive? then compare that with the list of negatives. ..i am currently a little envious of your void of cravings. goals!! :)
I concur!      hi Microsoft Bob I hope you're having a good day out there!
