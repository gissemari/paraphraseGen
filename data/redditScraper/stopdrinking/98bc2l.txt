Today marks one week being sober for me. This is the first week in a very long time that I've gone completely without alcohol. I was okay with 4 days 5 days usually even 6 days but that's when I would start getting irritable. The end for me was when I finally started to scare myself. I was downing a $5 bottle of vodka a day on Saturdays and Sundays. That's a lot of fucking vodka. I can only imagine the damage it was doing to my insides and to top it all off I was lying to everyone around me about it. I hid it for a year or so sneaking it in and out of the house. My wife is a former alcoholic so she of all people is the one I should've remained honest with but I wasn't. I was wasted last Saturday when I finally came clean. I told my sister first then my mom then my wife. I don't even remember what prompted me to do it but I'm so thankful I did. I don't know what I did to deserve so much support but it's really helping me get through all of this one day at a time. I'm learning to trust myself to be kind to myself again. For anyone struggling please keep in mind it's never too late to stop. I've stopped several times before and that's ultimately what brought me to start hiding it. I was too ashamed to face that I couldn't be without it. Now I'm making this choice for myself because I deserve better than forgetting my entire weekend over two $5 bottles of vodka. I will not drink with you today.
