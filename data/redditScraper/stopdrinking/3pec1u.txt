I've been in and out of the program for several years and each relapse gets worse and worse.  It feels especially isolating to work with all doctors no one of which has volunteered that they also struggle with addiction.  Sometimes it feels like I am the only one.  The benders are getting longer and more dangerous so it's time to make a change.  I'm ready!.Are there any resources out there specifically geared towards people in the medical profession considering how hush hush everyone is?  Thanks everyone.  I'm so proud of you all!  .xoxo

I have quite a few physician friends in the program; in fact I sponsored one of them.  For professionals the same things apply we need to learn to follow directions.  For me I found my way by meticulously doing the things my AA sponsor and professional colleague told me to do in the [Baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  So you've been in and out of the program and you no doubt will understand the wisdom--so what works: action.   Good luck.
Hello and welcome. I know many professionals in AA. Actually to my surprise my dentist was at my first meeting. I think it's important to remember that alcoholism is a disease and not a moral issue. I was a teacher and counselor in my younger years and involved in AA. What it takes to get well is the same for any occupation. A therapist was also one of my resources. What can you do differently this time so the outcome is different? [There's a chat room link in the sidebar and also Saturday Share stories.] Stay in touch. 
You are not the only doctor/med professional you know who is alcoholic but you could be the only one getting help for it. Thank goodness you are who knows what you are needed for! I'm a barista at the moment so to be useful and of service I put a friendly smile on my face and work really hard to steam your milk properly so you have a tasty latte and positive experience on your way into work. Someday I'm going to do more to give back because I've gotten a lot. As a med student you are poised to do big things and to see real life and death good happening because you are sober. I've had a very different experience this go around in sobriety because I have focused on being of service. You mentioned being in a program before so I assume you catch my drift with the AA principle of service. It fucking works that's all I know or care about. I do what gets results there's no need to overcomplicate it. 
Hello just wanted to say that yes I have heard of doctors meetings I can't point you in the exact direction unfortunately but I bet if you typed AA doctors meetings into Google you could find one. I apologize if this sounds sarcastic I honestly don't mean it in that way I just wanted to help by at least confirming that I have heard of such meetings. Peace and good vibes to you.
