I relapsed hard last night and now this morning I woke up late and am full of self loathing and regret. I do not miss feeling like this. What a stupid fucking decision. However the only thing I can do about it at this time is not drink today and I am very much looking forward to tomorrow morning and not feeling like such a pile of shit. Good luck to everyone who relapsed and who is maintaining a sober life. .Thank you all for the silent support this sub gives .

I did the same thing. Feels soooo awful. I'm here if you want to chat. 
Don't beat yourself up learn from it move on.. I am glad you came back!
Mate know how you feel falling off feels shit the next day and the self loathing hurts! We just need to dust off and try again. 
Your sober days before still count. Just try try try to remember this the next time it tries to sneak up on you... It aint worth the regret
