Celebrating One Year Two Months this weekend...If you're struggling Ask me anything...
----------immediate responses--------

Congratulations! What keeps you sober on days you feel like giving up? I have 17 days today which is huge for me. I still think about drinking when I'm upset or have my guard down. I hope I can make it as far as you. When I am honest and clear I admit that my drinking was 100% destructive but in weak moments I forget and it seems appealing. What is the magic that's kept you from picking up? Also what are the biggest changes resulting from your sobriety?..So happy for you I won't drink with you today!
How did you make it a year?  I would love tips.  Congratulations!  IWNDWYT
