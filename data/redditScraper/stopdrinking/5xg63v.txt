This didn't seem doable after multiple relapses. No euphoria just relief. One moment one minute one hour one day at a time.

Yes that's exactly how it's done! Good work. Let's be sober today too 'cause what the hell why not?
It is doable!  I've failed in my efforts at least fifty times and I have continued to do research and collect information that might help me change my behavior.  The information is [available](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/books).  I'm a huge fan of Art Markman.
Great success!  Forward!!
Right there with you and feeling fine.  Last few days were a challenge but each challenge we overcome just makes us stronger.  We got this!
Congratulations on your huge breakthrough.   You have an inspiring mindset.  
One day at a time...that's how to take life and sobriety. Good work!
1 week is not weak. Good work!!
