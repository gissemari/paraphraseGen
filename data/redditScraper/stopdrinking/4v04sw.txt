I've had way more cravings lately than usual. I blame this partly on the fact I had alcohol in my house recently (even though it's gone now) and that I've had so many bad dates where as when I was drunk I could get laid no problem. Now it's been almost a year since (I had one relapse but have almost been sober besides that a year) well I've even had a girl that remotely has interested in me in my life...Part of me misses the chaos. I miss the fun going out with friends meeting random people. I know where it will lead me though. I still am stocking up on naltrexone from the doctor in case I relapse call me crazy...I'm only 25 and at this age it's hard to find someone who doesn't drink. There's a few people. I'm honestly amazed I even have 134 days again which amazes me. I constantly have pressures left and right to drink to have fun and enjoy my stupid twenties!..Anyways I'm working a job that has nothing to deal with what I want to do in life. Really the way I look at my sobriety is I'll give my life a run for the money and if I'm working at Walmart at 40 I'll kill myself with alcohol no problem. But wasting it right now seems foolish so here I am being sober...These cravings are more persistent than before though and it's scary. I think I need to seek some individual therapy again. Even dating like I have been makes me stressed and think of alcohol. My massive trigger: relationships...I still am going to group aftercare from IOP. It's okay but not really doing much for me. I might attend an AA meeting I think what the hell. Better than going back to hell.

Shit out of all of your options AA seems the easiest and most convenient. ..Good luck with the sobriety and getting laid. .I'm holding thumbs on both counts.  
I'd also highly recommend this forum's irc chat if you ever need to talk things over i found it to be a lovely supportive place and a great resource even on your phone if you're out and about x
