I've been trying and trying and the I go a use. I feel like such a loser... I can't even explain why I used it defies all logic and reason. Just depressed I feel like I have no quit in me. I don't know how!!

I couldn't recover until I admitted that I had a mental illness which required treatment from an outside source. I can't think my way out of insanity. I have to rely on support from people who aren't me.
I had to relapse and dig myself deeper and deeper each time until I succeeded. Well this is what I hope anyway I'm only a handful of days in so far...But this worked for me for smoking anyway.
