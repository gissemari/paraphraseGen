Since January I wasn't drinking for the first 50 days in my life after 21 y.o. (I am 44) after was 30 days continuous relapse and today I am clean for 13 days again. The problem that I am feeling like shit sleeping more than 12 hours per day no energy no desire all muscles are in pain. Is it common how long more?

That all sounds pretty common I went through much the same.....It can take up to 10 days for the last vapours of alcohol and its nasty metabolites to even leave your system and after that there's a lot of healing going on internally as well as wonky brain chemistry which is just beginning to repair itself! ..There's an interesting [Recovery Timeline](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2sf5jm/my_attempt_at_an_alcohol_recovery_timeline/) there in case you haven't seen it... It's not a quick process and can't be rushed.....The first few weeks and months of recovery can be rough but it's well worth it in the long run!..Might be an idea to also have a checkup with your doctor to see how your health is doing and identify or rule out any nutrient deficiences or other issues that might be going on... ..Otherwise keep taking good care of yourself eating right taking light exercise when you feel up to it and plenty of rest and sooner or later you should start feeling a lot better!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
I'm 48 and it felt like I had been run over and beaten with a bat for the first 30 days. I was stiff as a board in the morning. Was exhausted for no reason and some days slept for 12 plus hours...The good news is it all passed but it took time. I did start feeling normal until I was close to 100 days in so stick with it because it will get better in due time and is well worth the wait.
Yeah Woody is right... we all had it or still having.. my stomach was sore for a week... i was pretty tired.. but not anymore.. hang on in there! It is so worth it! Your body tells you it needs a sleep.. its recovering.. i had reverse i was tired but couldnt sleep at all.. was awake at night and felt like crap the next day. Took me a few weeks to fix it. Iwndwyt
Same as the other guys. Hang in there it gets better. At a couple of months I was back in black. Which BTW means that playing the tape forward isn't just for one or two days - it's for one or two freakin' months. IWNDWYT
