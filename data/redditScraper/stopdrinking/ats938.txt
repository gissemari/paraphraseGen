Well I relapsed was feeling so depressed I was willing to do anything to feel better even have a beer. Well it tasted horrible (as always) and made my body feel like shit and I didn't even want to drink it anymore in fact I was so repulsed by it I don't think I ever have to drink again (nor do I want to). I didn't even really feel the buzz I wanted just felt gross so I stopped. I'm sober now though...Back to sober life for me for much longer this time probably forever. IWNDWYT

That's a pretty minor relapse more like a lapse. It's good you caught yourself and you re back here being accountable and committing to get back on the water wagon. Keep it up you've learnt that booze ain't for you. What's your recovery goal? Mine is to get to 1 year and then set another goal.
Hi this story sounds a lot like an experience of mine last summer. We get hung up on these numbers and badges and it's easy to lose sight of the bigger picture - we want to stop drinking. I learned from my own relapse and that knowledge that it isn't worth just a few beers is what's keeping me sober this time around. Maybe you can put your experience to use in the same way? It's a long game. 
Glad u stopped!!!
