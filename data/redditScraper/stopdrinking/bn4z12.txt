Made it all week without a drink pretty easily. That's never been a problem for me. But I'm currently sitting at home on Friday night and I'm dying for a glass of red wine right now. My brain has been telling me "the Braves are on tonight you haven't been able to watch all week. Now you can enjoy the game. Go grab a bottle of wine." But I won't. Usually by this time I'm already 3 or 4 glasses deep. Home at 4 glass in hand 15 minutes later. Drunk by 7. Passed out by 9:30. I wouldn't even make it to the game I'm looking forward to. I've made it this far. Let's roll into Saturday morning feeling good not hungover. IWNDWYT.

I never regret not drinking.  IWNDWYT
You can do this! I had the urge to drink earlier tonight but reminded myself that it would pass and it did. And even if you have to white knuckle it to bed time you'll be so glad you did in the morning. You've got this!
