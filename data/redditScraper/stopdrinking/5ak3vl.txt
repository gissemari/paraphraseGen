Whenever I am struggling and start to think about going to have a drink I remind myself to stop feeling sorry for myself and creating excuses to escape reality.   In other words put on my bid boy pants and tough it out.   Then I come on here and read through other peoples struggles.  I think about all the times where I was in similar situations and it helps remind me of where my drinking habits will eventually lead.     I'm not saying I am now perfect and lead a squeaky clean life but I'm sober and feel a lot better than I would be if I was stumbling through life drunk all the time. ..Thank you for taking the time to tell your stories and read mine.  You don't know how much they help many of us.

Poor poor...pour me another me!..Self-pity was a great to-go when I was still drinking and finding excuses to drink. That mix of self-hatred pride and nihilism really hit the spot back then. "Nothing matters life is meaningless I might as well drink because my life is just a blip in the universe"..:)
