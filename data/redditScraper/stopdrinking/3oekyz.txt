I figured I'd let you guys know tomorrow is my birthday and I will not drink today and wake up tomorrow and promise not to drink today...So I've been away for a while.  New Job working on the house things have been really busy... but keeping on the straight and narrow.  I currently am working on a remote site that is having some issues so while I wait for support I figured I'd check in and let you know how my second step went...I posted about doing my first step and plan to post on all steps so here it goes...Homework for second step: Reading Chapters 1-5 and Second Step in the 12 for 12...When we got together we talked about what I liked about reading it what I picked up.  He asked me about how I was into religion as a child I said I was a Christmas and Easter church goer.  I also mentioned how this one was something I struggled with when I get got in because of the "Power Greater than Ourselves" but then told him about how I came here and found someone posting about if you have a rock in your back yard and you need help your friends will help you therefore being a power greater then yourself.  I said the tables are that to me right now and while I am not the biggest in religion I pray every day when I remember (and I am forgetful sometimes) but by doing that even if there is nothing out there it helps clear my mind...He gave me what I needed for the next time and then we got dinner and went to a meeting.  ..

I would be considered an agnostic or freethinker but I'm active in AA.  ..As an agnostic in AA:  ..I personally do not believe there is one "god" who is looking down and shaping my life. (If so it is one mean dude to my family these days). I do believe that there is a power greater than myself and that is when more than one person in recovery supports another...just like /r/stopdrinking and other type groups. You + Me is a power greater than just me.
Hello. Happy Almost-30 Birthday! ..Thanks for posting. Glad to hear you're working on the steps. Even though I am an atheist I benefited from doing them too. AA provided me with many good things.  Keep the positive attitude.
