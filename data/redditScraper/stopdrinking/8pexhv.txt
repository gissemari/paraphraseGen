Something happened today that's really got me stressed out. It could possibly be resolved tomorrow or the situation could easily turn into a real cluster fuck. I struggle when I feel like I don't have control and facing the unknown. It's like my brain can't stop obsessing until I know what's going to happen. I made a list of activities and things I can control tonight. It's slightly helpful. I really want to chill forget and feel buzzed. Please remind me what that will lead to. I'm having a hard time playing the tape forward right now.

If you falter then your entire LIFE will be out of control not just this time of hardship. You CAN fight this urge! You got this!!! Sending all my love to you stranger. You are worth it!!
If your situation turns into a clusterfuck tomorrow are you going to be happy you drank the night before? Will it help you deal with the problem at hand?..If it doesn't blow up you'll be even more proud of yourself that you didnt numb yourself to what was stressing you out and instead you conquered that shit! 
Yep we have more control sober no matter what is happening.  It'll be easier to deal with whatever it is you will be more capable and grounded sober I guarantee..IWNDWYT 
There is nothing so bad that alcohol won't make it worse! 
Drinking won't fix the problem being anxious and being sad is normal. Numbing yourself out wont do anything it will only screw up your sleep schedule and make your life that much more complicated
