 ..Hi all. Just wanted to share my story briefly. I've been battling alcoholism/benzo addiction for 5 years and was a daily weed smoker for 5 years before that. The 5 years of alcohol abuse was marked with 6-7 relapses and hospitalizations (I honestly lost count after number 5) a diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis 2 job losses due to my drinking and pure misery. Every time I'd come out of the hospital after detox I'd tell myself this time would be different. I'd manage to stay sober for a few months and the cycle would start again. Always slow at first but by the time I needed another detox I'd be drinking a handle of 100 proof liquor every 1.5-2 days drinking every waking moment...In December 2017 after my last hospitalization I was hit by a lightning bolt of sorts and realized I couldn't keep doing this. I was going to die if I kept it up. My family had been supportive of me getting sober but I had lied to them about the number of times I had relapsed and the number of hospitalizations I had under my belt. I told my Dad I wanted to get help finally and he found a rehab for me in Southern California (I'm from Cincinnati Ohio). I left for California on December 22nd and didn't look back...60 days of inpatient treatment followed by 4 months of IOP and I'm currently living in a sober living house in Huntington Beach with 9 months of sobriety under my belt as of yesterday. My experience in treatment (it's my first time) gave me a renewed sense of purpose to help other addicts and today I have a job interview at a treatment facility in Newport Beach! On top of that the woman I'm currently dating is incredibly supportive of my recovery and I've made amazing sober friends along the way. I couldn't be happier with the way my life is unfolding in recovery and it feels great to know I actually have a bright future ahead of me as long as I stay committed to sobriety...Thanks for reading this if you took the time. :)
