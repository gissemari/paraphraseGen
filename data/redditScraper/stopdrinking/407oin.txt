Sigh I feel so weak and frustrated with myself! I have told myself every day for months that I was having my last drink or that tomorrow I wouldn't drink. Of course I always drink and end up feeling awful and hating myself. I'm laying around the house reading this sub all day until I have to go work the dinner shift at a restaurant. And I keep thinking about that free drink I'm entitled to at the end of every shift. I always start the shift saying I'm not taking that drink but then I feel like I've earned it and go for it anyway and that always leads to more drinks! I feel like I'm rambling so sorry but I just had to share something and this is what's on my mind right now.

Free milkshake an option?..Having a plan always helps me. 
Is there a bartender or someone you can tell to NOT give you a drink? ..
What I have earned at the end of each working day - is a sober fulfilling life. I will not drink today in solidarity with you. You have my support you can do this! If you have to go straight home do that you deserve it! 
Made it home sober! I came so close to losing it--I even asked the bartender for my shift drink but he suddenly got busy and I waited for a minute but then told him to forget it and went straight home! In my pjs heating up some food no booze in the house and feeling good. Thank you for all the support today!
