Hey man thanks for coming by. I'm also 34M and was also an active drunk for about 15 years before I started taking sobriety seriously...Glad you're here with us dude. Keep it up!
Can you get to rehab?
Do you have anyone in your life who understands and wants the best for you? I don't know if you're interested in trying the AA way but even if you're not you would meet some people there who've been where you are and gotten out.
