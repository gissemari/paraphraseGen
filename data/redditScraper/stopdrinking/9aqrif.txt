84 days sober and I stop on my way home for lunch and buy a bottle. Went to the house and had a couple drinks. Finished by drinking straight from the bottle. I have all .the resources anyone could want and still told myself it didn't matter to go drink. So very disappointed in myself. How the fuck do I reset my badge? Sorry for the language.

So you had a slip.  It happens.  You still made 84 days before it you can make way longer after if that's what you want.
Sorry you're struggling. Was this today?
Hi there!...At least you're straight back on it. Onward.
I've had loads of relapses but each time I learned something new about myself and my sobriety. 
I just would be careful to not let the slip up snowball. If you stay sober for 16 more days that would be one slip up in 100 days. Not bad at all. 
If you've been drinking your post might get removed since posting while drinking is against the rules of the sub but what matters is where you go from here. ..I don't know if you've seen the Smartrecovery tools but I found those helpful in refocusing myself (resetting a badge seems like the last thing I would worry about) http://www.smartne.org/tools.html ..I also find it helpful to journal about things that come up for me urges etc and I add them to list of things to talk to my therapist about. ..84 days is nothing to sneeze at that takes a lot of work to get there! I would keep going!

84 days Is fantastic.  Don't let this slip deter you.  Has happened to us all. Get back on the wagon and keep trying.  ..You only fail when you stop trying.  
Yea 84 days is a super long time! I went 50 days and it felt like a year! Get back at it and I won't drink today with u!
