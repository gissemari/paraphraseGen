Last week I had 10 days and after maybe a week I started feeling slightly better. Then because I felt somewhat energized I did more psysical stuff I'd done in weeks last sunday which of course left me feeling over-exhausted which in turn was probably the main reason for my relapse. ..The thing is 25 years ago when I stopped and stayed sober for 6 months I didn't have this issue meaning that I could start excercising about three days since I quit and I didn't feel as exhausted. And I haven't been just passive after that; I used to go climbing 2-3 times per week last autumn and I tend to commute and so most of my transport by bike from April to November. Is it possible that my health and overall physical condition have deteriorated that much in two years? Which seems pretty scary tbh. Last October I had my liver values checked (I was looking for an antabuse prescription) and they were so high that I was told the treatment could be started only after 1-2 months of sobriety. I didn't have liver damage though. ..I suppose what I'm getting at is that should I just take it really easy with exercise too? That was one of the tools I stayed sober last time i suppose i kinda switched the dopamine rush source and got addicted to movement but in a good way. Now I Just feel like sleeping...

Two years doesn't seem like that long but it's a long time on the organs and the body in general. ..My rule of thumb that works for me: it takes 5-7 days for alcohol to vacate the system. During the first week no strenuous exercise. Walking in the fresh air and relaxing stretching sessions are what I concentrate on. ..After that a SLOW build in the exercise department over the following weeks. ..It's easy to get frustrated and bored but I remind myself of what day I'm on and that reminds me I'm still VERY early on in recovery. ..I find that the best thing to exercise during this period is my patience...Good luck!
Short answer yes...Progressive Chronic Fatal...It's a Bitch!
