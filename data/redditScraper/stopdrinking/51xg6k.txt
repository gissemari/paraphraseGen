Last night was the last straw for me. I got loaded and flipped at my girlfriend whom I love very much and I hurt her feelings. I feel like a waste of skin like I don't deserve to be with her but I can't even imagine the idea of losing her. It was over something petty and stupid. No amount of alcohol is worth not having her in my life...I don't drink everyday so my struggle isn't as tough as most. But when I drink I drink to cope with my anxiety and I let myself become somebody that I don't like. ..Today that person that I hate dies along with my drinking. Here is to day one friends.
