Right now I have a strong urge to drink. Have spent the last days at my parents house and I think every day about drinking. Today was a particularly bad day my mother is so smothering I can't handle it. I should talk to her about it but our relationship is not the best and I know she will get hurt. It's always a bad idea to come here but for some reason I keep forgetting that between visits...Just needed to share I will not drink with you today!

Hang in there.  This too shall pass.  IWNDWYT
Distance yourself and stay strong. My mom is an alcoholic in denial. I haven't talked to her in years and it still took me until now to go sober. Mother/child relationships are fragile and can go so wrong so fast causing serious damage. You concentrate on you.
There is nothing so bad that drinking alcohol won't make it worse.
