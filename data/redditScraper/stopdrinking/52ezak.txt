Hello everyone.  Have browsed this sub a handful of times over the past year but am officially sober subscribed and ready to get involved.  Today was my 3rd day posting in the daily check-in.  .   .A little bit about me:  I'm 24 years old.  I am active relatively fit have a good job and enjoy being outdoors and spending time with my dog.  I am a self-diagnosed control freak and overall I think it's a good thing.  I like control in daily life over things like my eating habits and my schedule.  I like to have a plan.  I work very hard to maintain my weight and health and having control of my decisions and actions aides that.  The one thing that doesn't aide that?  Alcohol.  I don't drink every day.  I don't always drink heavy amounts.  But....none of it is worth it anymore.  It's affecting my personal relationships my physical health my sense of worth my bank account etc.  There is no place in my life for alcohol anymore.  It makes me someone I do not want to be.  It takes everything that I work so hard for and throws it away.  Friday was the last straw.  I was supposed to go over to my new boyfriend's apartment after a happy hour with friends.  He was getting up early to go mountain biking the next morning.  Instead I showed up at midnight.  Drunk and had driven myself there.  Apparently I had some very sweet and affectionate things to say...but I don't remember them and that broke my heart.  I wasn't present for an intimate moment with someone that I care deeply for.  I am missing out on my own life and I don't want that anymore.  So Saturday morning I found myself on this sub finally ready to make a change.  I read over so many of your stories your struggles triumphs daily anecdotes.  It encouraged and inspired me more than I thought possible.  .   .I don't know if I'm an alcoholic.  But I know who I want to be and I know alcohol only holds me back from that.  I'm not sure where I fit into the group dynamic here but just by seeing recent posts and comments I'm confident I have a place here.  You all seem to be some of the most supportive and welcoming people I've seen on reddit.  I'm looking forward to getting to know you and your stories and sharing mine as well.  Thanks for having me.

You don't have to be an alcoholic to have a desire to stop drinking. Your experience sounds a bit like mine. The good news is that all that stuff you mentioned you don't want to happen anymore doesn't have to happen any more if you don't want it to. ..Sobriety made my life much simpler. It gave me a lot of control of my previously unmanageable life back and has improved every single relationship in my life that I care about...The daily check in along with getting a badge (check the sidebar) were things that helped me get through the early days. It's weirdly motivating in a way...Thanks for your post and good luck. We believe in you!..
Welcome! I think stopping because you want to be more present is a great reason. There are lots of people here who have stopped for reasons other than physical dependency and it's great to have another member who feels that life is overall better without alcohol than with. I'll just be over here also not drinking.
welcome!..I'm not an alcoholic either!..I don't consume alcohol.  Alcohol is not a problem for me because I haven't had any in years!..Know what my problem is?  It's **ME**...Alcohol is not my problem.  I am my problem.  ..I have opportunities to work on:  control issues and accepting that I'm NOT in control as much as my mind wants me to think so.  I have issues with Fear Resentment Pride Impatience Intolerance Guilt and Anger...This sub and my other resources provide me tools to handle and process all those issues...However....... introducing Alcohol into me makes **All** those issues worse.   ..How about you?
