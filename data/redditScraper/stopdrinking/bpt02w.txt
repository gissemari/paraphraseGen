When I first wake up and those few seconds when before I properly 'come online' I turn and look to find the empty cans next to my bed and then the guilt shame and helplessness wash over me as I remember that I lapsed. I hate it. Hate going back to square one for the millionth time. Stands to reason that when I'm in a sober stretch I absolutely love opening my eyes in the morning and realising that I in fact chose NOT to drink last night. It's become a weapon now in my almost daily battle particularly when doing my shopping and the booze is physically close- 'think about how you will feel first thing tomorrow'. Not the hangover. The guilt and shame versus the relief and contentment. Have felt these emotions related to booze so many many times now I think it's finally sinking in. Fingers crossed. Nine days dry today.

Congrats on 9 days that is maybe the hardest stretch and if you can keep it going it will get easier and your guild and shame will fade away allowing for more positive emotions to emerge...&amp;#x200B;..IWNDWYT
