I finally did it and went cold turkey after getting evicted a month ago because of my drinking problem.  The changes after only 5 weeks are amazing.  My blood pressure has dropped considerably and I'm almost never depressed or anxious any more.  I used to think drinking helped my depression and anxiety... boy was I wrong!  Turns out it was causing it just like some of the users on this sub told me.  I'm also in a much healthier living situation now.  I have friendly roommates who respect me instead of bullying me and micromanaging as most of my previous roommates have.  It's so much better that I'm almost glad I got evicted except for the 1k loss I took. I'll be filing for small claims court to reclaim some of the money that was wrongfully taken from me (I was evicted illegally and much of what my landlord took from me was unjustified) and I'm greatly enjoying my change of lifestyle. I already almost never think about drinking anymore and I suffer cravings only a couple times a week and they last mere seconds.  The change since I quit has been so obvious and beneficial that I can't imagine going back. As unpleasant as it was maybe this wake up call was what I needed to get serious about my sobriety. .I've also wondered if going to AA meetings actually makes my cravings worse instead of better. I find that if I'm constantly reminded of what I gave up and made to feel guilty about it I'm more likely to want to drink. Since I quit I've only gone to two meetings. Does anyone else feel this way? What do you like to do instead of AA meetings?.Thanks for your help and understanding support. This sub really helped me in the beginning when I was feeling very down about my eviction and struggling with cravings.  Looking forward to not drinking with you all today :)

Congratulations on all the positive changes! I don't click with AA for whatever reason I thought I'd feel at home there but quite the opposite. I like coming here to SD better. I wish there were Refuge Recovery meetings near me as I think it sounds good. There's also SMART Recovery which lots of people like I know they have online meetings. 
I'm about 30 days after 2 years too.  The aa meetings aren't a downer for me and  they don't make me want to drink.  That being said I'm not a people /social person.  At the end of January they were having a birthday/anniversary party and I wanted to go.  But I don't know how to deal with party type social situations without alcohol. So I didn't go.  I can't even do an aa party.  At least I'm aware and didn't put myself in that situation.  ..Find what works for you.  Congratulations on your 30 days.
