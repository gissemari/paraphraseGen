Damnit sobernauts. ..I just realized something...I can *never* drink again...Yeah yeah. I know the old "just focus on the next twenty-four hours" line. Believe me that's the mantra I've repeated religiously to myself since starting this endeavor...But fuck! I just realized that I can never ever drink again...Now this isn't about the cravings. Apart from flashbacks of the old obsession prompted by the odd moment of intense stress or an unfortunately-placed advertisement those are largely gone...This realization is an intellectual one. A spiritual one as it extends to my entire conception of self...This whole time for practical reasons I set for myself these temporary goals of one week thirty days four months etc. but always kept the possibility alive of drinking sometime in the distant future...I just realized *that's not fucking possible.*..The catalyst for this I think has been spending time with my Mom who was an alcoholic before she had kids sobered up for most of her time as a parent (though stuck with the pills) but then relapsed and has spent much of her retirement wasted...You don't age out of this shit. ..The curse stays with you *your whole fuckin' life.*..Ergo..**I am a non-drinker now.**..::deeply inhales::..**I AM A NON-DRINKER NOW.**..This mission to Deepspace Sobriety I now realize was a one-way trip. ..I strapped in and blast off right to the edge of my known universe. I'll be there in seventy days (which at four months will be the longest dry stretch since I first started drinking)...But I ain't comin' back...The fuel tanks have been ejected the retrorockets have failed and I'm hurtling into the unknown of a wide planar field absent the comfort of my old home of torture and perverse love alcohol...Sayonara fucker! ..This space cowboy's headed to a higher more enlightened mode of being...For the rest of yah:..Peace be with you...Godspeed!

Rock on rocket man.
I'm currently going through similar feelings of loss over the same realization. I really like how by the end of your post you made it seem like much more of a positive thing. Props on the 'non-drinker' declaration. It certainly is easier to get by when you're just aiming for some arbitrary length of time like a month but to really say that "this is for life" is much harder. Good luck man you seem to be in a good mindset.
Word. Tis a shitty realization. What got me was thinking that on my wedding day I probably won't be toasting my husband with champagne. Tears. 
I'm in the same boat but I don't look at it that way.  ..I say "I'm never going to give alcohol another opportunity to hijack my life."
The Big Book says "If we are ready to quit drinking FOR GOOD AND ALL" (caps are my edit).  Not sure where that 24 hr stuff came from.
Yes.  I now need to change not only how I celebrate but *what* I celebrate...It's still possible to return to drinking I know but it's no longer possible to return *safely* to drinking...The awesome part of this journey however is that the destination is unknown.  I am no longer on a 'trip' where I return over and over to the same space...To infinity and beyond!
Yeah its sad to think that I can never have a drink again. But I also will never have a hang over again I will never forget what happened last night I will never wonder about all the people I pissed off last night I will never drunk dial/drunk text random girls I will never be the drunkest asshole at a party. Oh yeah one last positive thing I will never have a drink again : ) It's all about perspective. 
Honestly maybe this will help you if you think maybe i will drink again but not today not soon. And who knows maybe down the road you'll begin to believe it. Fake it till you make it. I can't honestly say I've taken my last drink. I'm not saying I want to now but I'm an alcoholic and the cravings will always come and go. I'm not cured nor will I ever be. I hope that helped but whatever works for you man just stay away from the first drink.
It isn't as bad as you think..In fact it is a whole lot better than you can imagine...Health.  Money. Relationships. Career   All not fucked up by drinking induced stupidity...It's been a long time and I don't miss it at all. One day at a time.
Yarrrr same here.  Hang tight for a string of first world problems below.  I promise there's a reason to share.    ..Despite my alcoholism I got 2 degrees from MIT and hold a pretty serious job.  3 times a year I retreat to random places in the Caribbean for a week and do nothing but sit in the ocean drink rum and smoke cigarettes until I can't see around the clock.  I've been doing this for a decade and these trips are the second most cherished thing in my life after my family.  ..Fast forward 6 months.  I will never do this again.  I want to live and be happy but I'm really struggling with WTF to look forward to anymore.  My wife has been trying to plan some sort of vacation and I'm 100% indifferent about the notion of vacationing now.  I'd rather stay home.  ..So I have to focus on one day at a time because I no longer to have anything to look forward to.  ..Thanks for sharing your optimism is encouraging and I wish you the best

Trust me you are NOT missing out on ANYTHING. Not drinking is awesome.
I lasted 4 days. Bought a bottle of vodka today because of an incident involving paperwork that can't be resolved til monday so I have two days of this hanging over my head. I can't do forever so I think I should kill myself to remove the time. Forever is forever.
&gt;I am a non-drinker now...Damn right.  And as a non-drinker it's not that you can never drink again it's that you *choose* to never drink again.  It's not a curse that stays with you it's just something you don't do.  I don't eat tomatoes.  I'm not mourning that as some big empty chasm in my soul. If I'm out to dinner and someone urges me to have *just one tomato* I don't feel bad about turning them down. I think *"What in the hell is wrong with this person? Why are they so unhealthily obsessed with my tomato intake?"*..I've gotta tell you the truth I've always admired people who don't drink.  Maybe that makes this whole thing easier for me I don't know.  People like Phil Jackson &amp; Penn Jillette don't drink and I think that's cool.  I spent a long time picturing my life without alcohol in it.  Imagining every possible scenario and me not drinking.  I'm fine with it.  More than fine actually. I'm happy about it.
Geez every time I see a post is from you I gear up for a good time reading.  Write a book about this and take my money already!  Space cowboy: adventures into sobriety.  ..Ps thanks for posting.  Big fan obviously.

I struggled with this a lot when I got sober. I actually talked about this just about an hour ago with a friend of mine. I heard someone saying this same thing "I can never drink again..." but it's not really true. You can get drunk. If you go to a bar they're not gonna say "Hey! You're an alocoholic! You can't drink!" You can get drunk pretty much any time you want. But you can't control it and enjoy it. I made a deal with myself that I would be sober for 6 months. Then after 6 months if I can honestly say that I was better off when I was using then I'll go back. It's been over 7 months ago and I didn't even notice that deadline pass. 
You're way ahead of me. I still do it a day at a time and I have never sworn off drinking. I'm sure there are some situations where drinking would help but I've never found one yet.
&gt;This whole time for practical reasons I set for myself these temporary goals of one week thirty days four months etc. but always kept the possibility alive of drinking sometime in the distant future...I'm right here with you on that one. I didn't start off to quit forever^ever^ever^ever^ever. No I just wanted to clean my act up for 30 days. Lo and behold after 30 days I felt amazing. Better than I had in years. During that time sure I had cravings but I wasn't a "victim" of alcoholism because I was concurrently improving my life in other ways. Sure there were times when I thought about drinking but drinking is a choice and I chose not to make that choice. You may be thinking that perhaps I wasn't a true alcoholic but I totally was. It was ruining me by all objective standards and I was high 20s on the sidebar test. Believe me I ludda drink more than almost anyone I know. Almost every negative thing in life I can trace back to alcohol be it relationship issues financial difficulties career struggles. All because of my dear friend boozeroo. ..So things were good and rather than celebrate my 30 days with a drink I "committed" to another 90. I'm like a month and a half away from that goal now. Things are so much better that I'm astounded. I look better feel better and ***am*** better. Moreover I am not engaged in a bloody battle against an unyielding foe: I'm just a guy who doesn't drink anymore. That's all there is to it. I can do literally anything I want in life but I just don't do *one* thing. ..The notion of never drinking again is weird and I've ruminated on it quite a bit. Come summer will I miss those refreshing patio beers? You know the afternoon social that starts out so innocently with a few suds with friends but later morphs into a slobberingly hammered Tuesday night with a regretfully slovenly hangover at work the next day? Yeah I'll miss the first part but for me the first part doesn't come without the second part so it's got to be no. I can repeat this scenario with any drinking fact pattern. The beginning of drinking is pleasant and social and innocent. But for me it only starts there. I must also take into account the reality that once I pop I can't stop and this has disastrous consequences. So given that fact I just don't drink. ..I know that I'm simplifying a lot of this but that's what works for me. I am not an alcoholic madman with a insatiable demon inside of me constantly clawing at my innards trying to escape. No I am just a guy who doesn't drink. This way is much easier for me. 
**I AM A NON-DRINKER NOW.**..Isn't that a great feeling? ..Fuck yeah!
