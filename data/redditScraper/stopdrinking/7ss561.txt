Completely and utterly sober from alcohol.  No regrets.  Was actually surprised I hadn't looked at the little ticker on my flair until just now.  Man it feels so good!  This is the first time I've given up drinking and gone without for this long and not felt like I was missing out on something.  Honestly I never expected to feel this good about it.  There's still days that are harder  than the rest but they're gradually becoming fewer and further between.  It does get easier because you get stronger! I hope everyone reading this especially those who might be struggling can hang on! I will not drink with you today!
