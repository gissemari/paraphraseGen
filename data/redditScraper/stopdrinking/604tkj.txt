Had a nightmare last night where I relapsed and bad things happened. It was pretty graphic. The good news is that it was just a dream and I've made it to double figures! ..I've read posts on here about boredom before and wow I really do have a lot of time free now. ..Instead of spending my nights drinking so far I've been cooking working out a tiny bit (I'm so unfit it's ridiculous) and learning Korean just to keep my mind occupied. I find that I get really tempted when I'm sitting around doing nothing so I try not to let that happen.  ..Wanted to say a gigantic 'thank you' to everyone on this sub for being so very lovely and supportive! You're a great community to be a part of.

Hooray for those double digits! It sounds like you've got a great plan to keep your mind and body occupied /u/Cass606 :)). How are you feeling overall?..Also yeah the drinking dream...I haven't had one in a while but it scared me when I did. I woke up with my heart racing!
The dreams can be difficult to cope with but at least you still have your sobriety! Congrats on the double digits keep adding to it.
