I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for your help...Although my family has been by my side and praised me it was reading your stories and your advice and your encouragement that let me keep powering on. SD is the first thing i read when i wake up and the last when i go to bed. This connection to so many people all over the world joined in the same struggle helped make me feel like i can really do this after all..I will not drink with all of you today. And Thank you.

I had to recently reset my badge but have reaffirmed by commitment to not drink with you all today.
Couldn't agree more ;&gt;)&gt;..Alone it's hard.... *together* it's much more doable!..Congrats on 60 days what a fab milestone - I won't drink with you today!..Best wishes ..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Congratulations on 60 days!  yes I agree that connection to so many others is really powerful.   
Nice work on 60!
One of the reasons I am not drinking now is that I don't want to let down thousands of people on SD I never met...It makes no sense and perfect sense all at the same time.
Congratulations!!! Have you noticed any benefits from not drinking?
Way to go! 
Your post made me want to comment for the first time in a while. We're all here listening to you and pulling for you too. You are lucky to have your family they are your best resource. ..60 days has to be the toughest milestone. It was for me. It's right around the time you start thinking you can moderate. But remember why you decided to quit. If you could moderate you wouldn't have had to stop in the first place. ..When you get to 3 months you will be miles closer to putting that thinking behind you. ..Thanks for the post. I'm glad this place exists...
