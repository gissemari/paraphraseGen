Sounds funny almost since as the older sibling being schooled by the younger of us but I'm proud of her for confronting me how she did..Don't get me wrong it broke my heart to have my dear sister my best friend in ways weepy eyed telling me she wants her big brother back but its given me the motivation I need to break this cycle for good. ..I'm not only proud of her for telling me exactly what was on her mind I'm that she doesn't drink not at all says she hates what it tastes like and hates what it does to people. I know I can learn a lot from her to help me get sober and by doing so I can make her wish a reality by kicking this vile poison out of my life once and for all. ..I won't fail you Nicola but most importantly I won't fail myself.I'm sorry I ever put you or any of my family through this. I won't drink with you guys today.

My husband said the same to me. He told me he hated the person I became when drinking. I always thought I was fun and easy going. He says it makes me someone completely different.  .We can do this. I know an urge / desire moment will arrive and I hope that being on this group will help me fight it. We got this. 
I'm glad to see you back here    .I will not drink with you today
