Really just need an ear so that someone knows how hard this has been because it's been awful. After hiding my heavy drinking for over a year I've finally gotten serious about getting sober and taking my life back. But nobody knows I was drinking that much and nobody knows I've been sick as a dog these past few days...She and I live together but our schedules are very different. Fortunately she hasn't been home for the most obvious symptoms and now that I'm not shaking anymore I hope she won't notice. It has been hard to hide/explain the jumpiness emotional irritation and insomnia. It's added to the stress a whole other psychological layer...She knows I'm an alcoholic but thinks I stopped last year. That's when she told me she'd leave me if I started drinking again which is why I hid it so well. It's also why I'm determined to get sober so I don't have to live a lie anymore. But I didn't realize that would require me to lie throughout an awful period of being sick. I had no idea what relapsing at home by myself and in secret would be like...Thank you for reading this. Just had to get it all off my chest

Most importantly you did it and you can and will continue to be sober that is monumental for an alcoholic. I'm sure it will feel like a weight off your chest not to be lying to your fianc . Best of luck and congratulations.
You're past the worst part bud. Just stay away from that poison. We can do this IWNDWYT
Wow I'm really surprised you were able to hide it. Any of the times I've gone through withdrawal I am completely useless and can't hide it at all. On day 4 you should be in the clear but I would still be very careful. I almost died from it once with no warning at all...Good luck! Keep going- no more hiding
