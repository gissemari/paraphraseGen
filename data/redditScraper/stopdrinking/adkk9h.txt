Monday's have always been the same... wake up for work with struggling with a pounding headache tired nauseous just trying to make it to quitting time so I can turn my brain off and relax... today is so much different. Had a good healthy night of sleep I'm refreshed and ready for work with a little energy. I can get used to this. And I know I'm not even close to 100% with only a week of sobriety so looking forward to the weeks ahead. Not 100% but at least not -10% to start a week. IWNDWYT!

Day 7 - best I've felt on a Monday in a looong time too!
Same here! Sundays were my favorite drinking day so I've had to kind of struggle past them but then Monday comes and I'm focused productive and ready for an awesome week and it's all worth it :-)
Funny how that works! Haha congrats on a good Monday.
I've had two amazing Monday's so far and it's a world of difference. I used to skip morning gym on Monday because I was too hungover. Now I'm there all 5 days a week and ready to tackle Monday!
Have you had any trouble sleeping? 
Hoping day 7 is better than 5 today for me. I feel so anxious and depressed. I've just been cryin all day. 
Sunday's were the day to drink until passing out in order to avoid the feelings of not wanting to go into work which were made so much worse by drinking. I will not drink with you today!

It's got me on a sober streak Mondays suck but hungover ones suck even more..IWNDWYT or tomorrow.
