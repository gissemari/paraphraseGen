I never would've thought on the morning of July 8th 2012 that life could be as good as it is today...Struggle: Relationships are weird and wounderful...General chat: Winter I said I was done.

Uh oh. [Guess what day it is.]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWBhP0EQ1lA)
triumph: i'm on a pretty positive kick right now! i'm sticking to the things i know i need to do to stay happy in recovery/in general and things are all working out well...struggle: my car got a flat tire yesterday and is currently sitting in the parking lot of a local grocery store. luckily i didn't freak out over it - accept the things you cannot change- i'm getting a ride to school this morning and then taking care of it in the afternoon. apparently you can join AAA with a "pre-existing condition" you just have to pay $25 if you use it in the first 24 hours of getting it. ..general chat: i'm right there with you on the winter thing!
Triumph: Will hit 60 days this week. Pretty psyched about that. After that it's time to kick the smokes too...Struggle: I've finally started getting my financial house in order but I'm kind of overwhelmed with all the bills I actually pay now. I mean I've always had these bills but I didn't give a shit and never paid them causing two of them to go to collections. Not drinking has saved me hundreds and hundreds of dollars over the past two months but now all that money is going to bills. ..Chat: Supposed to get the first snow tomorrow. This will be my first winter sober and I'm really not looking forward to it. Winters fuck me up.

Triumph: kicking procrastination to the curb!..Struggle: some serious fear and crazy brain tracks playing. ..Chat: adopted a kitty in mad adoration. Bring on the summer. Berry season is kicking in.

Triumph: I turn 28 years old today!..Struggle: Holy shit I am in my late twenties...still a young one but growing up is amazing...General chat: **CAKE**
Happy Wednesday guys!!..Triumph: Starting to miss alcohol less and less. I've been really paying attention to my feelings and I realize I'm not so much addicted to the alcohol as much as I am the act of drinking. Doing something without actually having to do something escaping (boredom anger sadness anxiety) having an excuse to be stupid and say whatever I want to say. This doesn't sound like a triumph but I'm happy I came to this realization so I can start dealing with all of this underlying crap. ..Struggle: Husband's been working 12s all week and he's going up north tomorrow through next Wednesday hunting. That's a lot of time to have no break from a constantly going 19 month old. My parents help when they can but I hate breaking my routine and my morning workout was really the big thing that gets me feeling good and excited to start the day. I'd even settle for taking the little one for a walk but it's 23 out today so that's not going to happen. Basically I'm pretty pissed that my husband gets a week to go piss away in the woods and I can't even get an hour to go to the gym. Usually I spend deer widow's week getting drunk and enjoying a clean house so I'm going to have to actually really focus on doing something else. ..General chat: I think the above was enough bitching for today. Thanks for listening guys :)
triumph: went to my first meeting last night didn't drink after...struggle: holiday season and upcoming parties..chat: holy sinus pressure batman!
Triumphs: I'm sober I went to a bar with my friends and drank water I told all my friends that I've quit drinking *I've been sober for a week guys!!*..Struggle: I'm incredibly lonely. My bff decided to trick my (sort of) SO into believing I'd done terrible things and lied to her about them. Then she fucked my distraught SO. So I lost my gf and my best friend. As though I haven't been lonely enough lately.....General Chatter: I feel *great*. I'm figuring out my underlying issues and learning to live as a function adult. I've realized that drinking *never* fixes the reason I went out drinking. God bless AA.
W00t!  500 days!  Congrats NMBP!  That's awesome!..**Triumph**: I've cracked the year mark and am going strong.  I feel fantastic even though I've been sort of tired and sore lately.  I took 4 days off from exercising which is the longest I've gone without doing *something* since May when I hurt my ribs.  But I'm back.  I went to KM yesterday and played tennis this morning.  I've got more KM at lunch and more tennis after dinner...Now that I've gotten to a year sober I've changed my phone's day counter widget to represent my /r/decaf badge instead of my r/stopdrinking badge.  It's not that I'm getting cocky it's that I don't feel the need to count the days anymore.  I see my badge enough in my posts and comments here anyway...**Struggle**: I got nothing.  Life is awesome...**General chat**: Winter.  Bah!  I spit in your cold face!

Triumph - I have ~50 more miles to run to hit my goal for the year of 1000 miles!..Struggle - Still eating which is way too tied to my emotion crap and dealing with guys /dating. Dating sucks. ..Chat - I'm super excited about everything sports related right now. My college team is #1 in basketball #13 in football all of my pro teams except the redskins are leading their divisions!
Triumph: Went to the fridge last night and moved the beer aside to get to a can of Pepsi.  I touched a beer and **didn't open it**.  ..Struggle: Working from home.  Lots of temptation to either dip into the remaining booze/beer in the house or run out to the store to pick up a case.  (The stuff in the house is not mine haven't yet asked the owners if they'd mind dumping it or locking it up.)  So far I'm dealing well with it by having a big glass of water and taking the dogs out when the temptation hits...General chat:  I'm ready for these damned leaves to stop falling.  I've moved so many freaking leaves over the last two weeks.  The trees look mostly bare now but the wind keeps moving them right back up to the front of our house.  They taunt me. 
Triumph: I'm sober. Thank you SD. I'm so excited for Thanksgiving making plans cause I have the whole week off. Love love love to cook not going to ruin it by drinking I've got my plan in place. Struggle: I'm still sick with this crud. AND I don't know if the various shitty physical stuff is the cold or withdrawal. Even with being such a drunk these last 5 years I'm not used to my body backfiring on me like this. Chat:My kids are awesome I could go hoarse bragging on them. My vegan21 year old daughter has talked me onto making tofu cheese as an appetizer for thanksgiving. So next Wed. my kitchen will be a cheesemaking plant! Enjoying every moment of being sober and beating back the cravings.
Triumph:Went to a therapist for the first time on Monday. Turned one year sober yesterday. I've been able to study a bit. Tomorrow I will go again to a therapist..Struggle:Mood is going down a bit. Still going to fail at least one class. Getting hooked on coffee again...General: Thanks for doing this what'supwednesday tradition I appreciate it. Also Im grateful for this subreddit it has helped a lot.
Triumph: Just mastered three huge challenges within one day: Went to the pub watching a football game without drinking beer. Went to a business trip including an awesome hotel this was always a huge trigger in the past. Also didn't drink. Held an important presentation in front of a few but very "important" people. Also: Didn't drink. ..It feels more and more like alcohol is getting blurred out of my life. Anyhow I'm still cautious. ..Struggle: 4 days without working out I'm starting to feel uncomfortable... ..Chat: Switzerland is very beautiful. Expensive but beautiful. Going to enjoy some chocolate later bought some for my SO and mother (me good boy). 
Triumph: Took my dad to all his appointments clear headed and apologized for being a bitch to his physical therapist (was coming off the antidepressant Venlafaxine...please heed my advice and do not take this drug it was bad news bears for me...Struggle: Switching from second shift to first this week. My body/mind is tired and confused...Chat: I ate lunch at the U.S's oldest and longest running soda foutain today with my dad. Husband is also starting a new painting and I finally have gotten around to read a book I bought a million years ago.
Triumph - waking up without feeling woozy/hungover/crappy continues to be amazing...Struggle - Rob Ford works out at my gym and seeing the people fawning over him as he 'works out' makes me want to drink...Chat - What is your favourite Xmas movie and why is it Bad Santa?

**Triumph:** Nothing particular but am grateful that my relationship with my family and friends is so strong.  Huge help as I pursue sobriety...**Struggle:** I had a lapse a couple of days ago.  Definitely no joy in it and no temptation to keep drinking...**General Chat:** Up in our NY office today for a senior staff meeting.  Manhattan turns into a special place during the holidays...looking forward to it.
triumph: Went to trivia last night and did not drink.Struggle: try to pick up pieces to fix my life .General: write a thesis ..
Triumph:  longest I have not drank in 8 years!..Struggle:  have been dealing with some weird cravings that have to do with just wanting to "taste" a good microbrew.  My brain says just a taste and spit it out you know?  What harm is that?  This is very strange to me because by the end of my drinking I didn't care at all what it tasted like. My question was is it going to mess me up?  Good...pour me some of that...Chat:  I said last winter I was moving before the start of winter.  I also said that the winter before that.....and the one before that.....maybe now that I am sober I will actually do it!..
Triumph: getting ready to run my 7th marathon this weekend.  I'm ready...Struggle: home sick today.  I have a cold took some zinc and my tummy flipped out from the zinc.  Feeling better now but have done nothing today but nap and lay around...General chat: while running in the park I saw a golden pheasant walking around.  It was magnificent.  Must be an escaped pet though because it's native to China and I'm in the American South.
Triumph: I didn't drink yesterday and attended my first two AA meetings (I only planned on going to one but someone persuaded me to go to another immediately after... 2 meetings in 3 hours).  ..Struggle:  I have had a few slight cravings but today for some reason has been the worst.  I actually feel less motivated now than before I attended those meetings last night.  Not sure if there is any correlation there.    ..General:  I just really want to stay sober.  
Triumph: Sober. Have friends. Healthy. ..Struggle: Legal case in mediation this week that will affect my life pretty fundamentally. Finances are tied up in it. And the marriage...Chat: Decided to scotch the next marathon after Thanksgiving and run a half instead. Haven't had time to train properly with everything else going on and while my instinct says to gut it out and prove how tough and determined I am my instinct also produced all the problems noted in "Struggle" above. 
Triumph: With a mindset geared toward sobriety I am more focused on my work now than I have been in a long time...Struggle: I have a Thanksgiving get-together with friends coming up and it will be very tempting to drink. Especially since one friend and myself were the ones who brewed the pumpkin beer that will be available at the party. ..General chat: Avocados and honey mustard make a shockingly great combination on turkey sandwiches. 
Triumph- 4 weeks clean and sober.Struggle- my roommate( mother ) goes for surgery next month. I'm scared for her and also myself. I will be home alone for over a week and only accountable to myself..Chat- grateful for so much including everyone here :)
Triumph: birthday today and no booze!.Struggle: lady friend is moving away :(.General chat: on the same topic as other dude. ..cake! !
Triumph: 18 days sober longest I think I've ever gone but first time I've ever seriously said "i'm done"..Struggle: My boss has been a total A**hole toward me for the past 3-4 weeks so I'm miserable at work and come home every day thinking it would be nice to have a drink....Chat:  So happy to have this subreddit.  Thanks.
Triumph: I'm here..Struggle: I'm really angry. I'm tired of hearing the same apologies from my friends in AA about why they flaked. Stop making apologies and just show the fuck up. It just sucks to be abandoned. It's okay because I'm capable of making new friends and a new support but I am losing friends too. It just sucks. Addicts can fucking suck...General chat: got to go to a 10 hour 2-day enneagram workshop through work. Coolest thing ever. I recommend it.

Triumph: 18 days sober 2 days into nofap (sorry if that's overshare but it's a personal best!). Feeling healthier more focused and more stable than before...Struggle: Almost all of my social groups revolve around some sort of drinking. My friends are supportive of my sobriety (having a drunkn car crash tends to enforce the seriousness of the problem) but they all still drink around me. Drinks after volleyball tonight were difficult. And this weekend is a volleyball tournament - usually it's a three day bender with hung over sports between. Not this time!..Chat: I am traveling interstate for a volleyball tournament tomorrow! I'm so excited! 
Triumph : I work in the middle east so today is the end of the week..Struggle : So much underground drinking here in this supposedly sober country it is harder to stay clean..Chat : How to pay back for all the people that helped me get clean. Staying clean?.
Triumph:  staying sober around a bunch of my friends at a show 2 nights ago..Struggle:  Going out to bars with my family and brother who I haven't seen in a year this weekend..Chat:  Apples and pears are DELICIOUS!
