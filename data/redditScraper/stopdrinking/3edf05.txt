I'm at day 42 and until a couple days ago I was so happy and confident with my sobriety. Then I had a few days of feeling sad unfulfilled impatient fed up etc....I come to SD daily but yesterday helped me so much. There were a couple posts by others who have about the same amount of sober time as I do and who are experiencing similar struggles. I must say it was a huge relief to know I'm not alone and these feelings are not uncommon. So I just want to say THANK YOU to each and every one of you! This sub is saving me!.Normally I'd bake for you all but this will have to do :) .

It's crazy how much it can help even when you're having your worst day to know that you're not alone. And yet with billions of people on this planet we tend to assume that our experiences are so original so uncommon so unlike anyone else's...

Happy towel day!..Just occurred to me that sobriety is like a never-ending advent calendar; each day holds new experiences gifts insights etc. behind the door. It's not always easy but it's worth it.
I'm new here and I plan on using SD to help me out. :)
SD helps me every day--each and every Sobernaut or newcomer no matter how many days sober are part of the journey.  
There's always someone here nowadays. And those that aren't here at the given moment leave a trail of useful words and wisdom. Let's say a jar filled with different size rocks in it represents my sobriety resources in my case: 12-step program meetings sponsor counselors doctors fellowship etc. SD not only adds some more stones to the jar but lots of pebbles and sand too. My sobriety jar has never been more chock full o' resources. 
Day 28 and starting to lose my honeymoon feeling of sobriety. I'm not interested in drinking so much but I have had more of a struggle in the last few days.  
So glad you made it through!  Yes we're not alone.
