It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-----------------------------------------..**Struggle:** Since my mother can no longer nag me about my illegal drug use my cigarette smoking or my excessive drinking she is now criticizing the fact that I eat up to four organic vegan gluten-free breakfast bars every day throughout the day. (She said to me  You eat so many such an imbalanced diet cannot be good for you! )..**Triumph:** I love seeing old friends without having terrible facial bloat. It's so nice to feel confident again instead of feeling ashamed of my appearance...**General:** A dinner guest recently recited an Adirondack epic poem about a man named McGee and his lovely lady Lou and it was a hit with everyone around the table. Inspired I am now trying to memorize a different Adirondack epic poem titled  Allen's Bear Fight Up in Keene  to recite at a future dinner party. I've known the poem since I was a child...My favorite line of the poem has always been when Allen is locked in mortal battle with an old she-bear   Oh God!' he cried in deep despair  If you don't help me don't help the bear!'  (Kind of like what I might say in my fight to the death with alcohol.).
----------immediate responses--------

**Struggle:** Work is tough right now. Big changes in my department coming and I'm not looking forward to it. I'm thinking about starting to look for a new job but it's really stressful so I'm trying to take it slow and not make any rash decisions. ..**Triumph:** I'm sore today from lifting weights yesterday. I've been lifting on and off for years but I've lost weight recently doing Intermittent Fasting and I'm starting to look good! So I want to tone up and build some muscle so I look even better. I'm committing to weight-training and swimming at least 3 times a week. ..**General:** I'm thinking about remodeling my kitchen soon which while also a bit stressful is much funner than the job thing because I'm looking forward to making everything look the way I want it. I already have some paint samples up and I'm hoping to choose a color soon!
**T:**  Took the NCLEX (Nursing board exam for RN license)...**S:**  Don't know if I passed or failed.  I'll find out later today.  I'm very anxious and trying to stay calm.  Either I passed or failed.  Before I'd deal with the anxiousness by drinking.  Now I'm just dealing with the anxiousness. ..**G:**  I'm reading a graphic novel called The Sandman.  In it a line reads "...there's a thin line between intoxication and unconsciousness..."  Yup.  I know all about trying to straddle that line.  
Struggle: The people I've opened up to about my drinking don't take it seriously. My dad will tell me to be stronger or he'll try to be funny by making some comment about how much I can guzzle. All my best friend ever wants to do is drink and gives me a hard time every time I volunteer to be DD instead of drinking. Then I went 10 days no alcohol which is the longest I've gone in 3 years and when I told my boyfriend he replied sarcastically "Oh yeah because 10 days is so long." I've tried to express how bad it's gotten this last year but nobody wants to admit that I'm an alcoholic or they don't think it's bad enough. ..Triumph: I'm 3 days sober after going on a 3-day bender. I'm bulimic and haven't purged in almost 2 weeks. ..General: I adopted an 18-week-old Cane Corso puppy and named her Lucy. Getting into a new routine with her has felt really good and I find myself thinking less about alcohol these last couple days (except at night when she's asleep). I'm really scared of what could happen to her if I drink and get careless so that fear is preventing me from drinking right now. I want to be the best for her. 
**Struggle:**  I seem more agitated and dwelling on the past lost friendships stopped playing music for years work left piling up picked up 23kg while drinking beer every day wasted time doing nothing while drinking (most of my 20s) can't seem to forgive myself...**Triumph:**  I actually feel like working out after work have been going and using this extra energy productively went a weekend without drinking and didn't even want to touch alcohol...**General:** Happy to have made it this far and looking forward to getting back in decent shape. Thank you SD :)..Oh and I just realized it's a long weekend starting today! If I can make it through this without drinking I can go for much longer. Have a great day everyone! I will not drink with you today :)
Sheesh.  Eat the hell out of your og v gf bars.  I swear there is no pleasing some people.  ..I like your poem goal...**Triumph:** I managed a road trip with two teenagers in a tiny car and we all enjoyed ourselves for the most part.  I was offered some drinks but it was easy to turn them down.  I felt happier knowing that I didn't need them.  ..**Struggle:** I have now gained back 80% of the weight I've lost over the past two year.  With two months of quitting smoking under my belt I think it's time to buckle down and hit the gym.  And no more sour patch kids!  Damnit.  I love those things.  Sometimes I really wish I could have one freakin' vice that didn't fuck up my world...**General:** Summer is just not the same without summer vacation.  I miss having three months of freedom.  
**Struggle:** After a great summer I ve had increased anxiety the last weeks. It s related to the very difficult situation around my son and his mother and my wife and our two kids. I simply see no solution to this decade long conflict other than trying to be a good husband and father (and ex husband) letting more time pass and praying that other people too will try to loosen their knots...**Triumph:** Nine months tomorrow! I can virtually see the ribbon at the finishing line and feel the taste of blood and exhaustion. It s not really the finish but still. It s a mile stone...**General:** Building lego is therapeutical.
Hey guys I am an idiot okay I shouldn't jabe binged for almost two weeks I took a couple days break during it but right now right now it's hell and I'm terrified I'm jsut a bit shakey and I feel almsot like I'm tripping. If anyone wants to give me some advice or good news about it it would help me a lot because I'm scared. I will be swimming a bit so if I don't respond that's why but still. This is it this is why I hate alcohol the only tiem this has been worse was when I had a acid flashback becusse of a hangover. I'm kinda done with alchohol and so I'd also like soem help with that I hope this wasn't too many words I'm not in an unsafe level atm and I don't think I will be I'm just kinda spooked and I'm sorry I didnt use the format 
**Struggle** Work. Always work. Yesterday I realized I sent a huge check to the wrong party and that indeed it had already cleared the bank. Took me a while to get contact info for said party and when I spoke to her she was very nice and said she'll cut me a check and send it back to me right away. I hope that was the truth. I'm going to have a tense week. I swore in the checkin yesterday to be more positive "come what may" then came that mistake and I had a total meltdown at work for the first time. All the stresses extra hours frustrations of the past 7 weeks had not made me cry until then. Now I will hold my head up and try again for a positive day. ..**Triumph** Looking forward to a walk with dog in a few minutes and then my night to teach at the gym later. ..**General** Also looking forward to going to a beach town this weekend with boyfriend and dog. Have a good day everyone. 
S: trying to cut out the marijuana currently. Out of these last 40 days of alcohol free life I have smoked marijuanas for 11 of them. I can see now after having keeping my head clear from boozing that weed is a problem for me too despite that it does relax me...T: I made it 21 days without either weed or booze in the first bit of these 40 days. I haven't done that since high school! That was 15 years ago. I also haven't gone overboard with smoking the way I used to. ..G: usually the good is somehow tied to the bad. I'm not going to beat myself up for smoking (as I will be moving to a place where I can't get it legally soon) but I also have to remain vigilant to not return to my old habits as it will eventually lead to drinking. 
Struggle: Dealing with fallout from my last binge. Called a bunch of people. Shared info about a good friend who is now pissed. Trying to mend relationships...Triumph: in one week of sobriety I have gotten more work done on my manuscript than I have the rest of the summer!..General: summer is going by so quickly... I will miss it but am a student and am looking forward to the structure the fall semester will bring. Long stretches of days of nothing scheduled are always tough for me. 
Struggle. I gave in a bit last night. I didn't go totally overboard but I still drank. ..Triumph. I poured the little remaining alcohol out this morning. ..General. I've got a busy day ahead of me and I'm ready. I've even packed my lunch dinner and snacks to take with me. I'll be out late working. Gonna be great!
Struggle: I feel strange today. I'm just shy of two weeks and it is really hitting me how over the past couple years I went to the liquor store every. single. day. I would alternate where I went because as much I was resigned to my drinking there was still a feeling of shame of my powerlessness and at least I could give the illusion to the employees that I only drank every few days...I hated that the cashier's would recognize me how I knew which was the fastest line knew to say: "No Air Miles Debit Please No Receipt." It was so routine...I guess at 2 weeks the initial excitement of "I'm realliy doing this!" has worn off and feels weird to be proud of something that most people do: not go the liquor store for two weeks. I worry I'll get complacent now that I'm getting comfortable with my sobriety...Triumph: It's been 2 weeks! I swear I look healthier already younger even. I have a nighttime routine (that doesn't involve passing out on the couch ha)...My anxiety has improved immensely and I really feel the cravings are pretty well gone. Last night was stressful and as a knee jerk I imagined cracking open a can but it was different. There was no pull to it just a passing thought...General: I was waitlisted into getting into college but was offered admission yesterday! Now to arrange childcare and all that fun stuff...After feeling beaten down the last few months everything seems to be on the up and up. So life is pretty good at the moment.
One day at a time! I will not drink today
Struggle: Trying to save money but expensive things just keep coming up. I feel like every time I get ahead my car breaks down or something at home needs to be fixed or (the latest) my pet needs to go to the vet. Ugh...Triumph: I tried out a new craft and finished my first big project last weekend. I'm really proud of it. I'm inspired to make more!..General: Really hoping for it to cool off in SoCal soon this intense heat is changing my routine in annoying ways. It's also killing my yard. 
**Struggle:** I'm exhausted and my body aches. Last week was hell trying to get our house ready to go on the market Saturday which led to a night of binging Sunday. [Read my "I'm done." post for more context](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/95dz5i/im_done/). I'm hoping the lingering body aches and exhaustion are from last week but my health anxiety is creeping in a little bit. To top it off work this week will be intense; 9 hours on Monday 11 hours on Tuesday. This will be a 50+ hour work week...**Triumph:** Last night was night 3 even though I still have a can of Sierra Nevada in my fridge. I've thought about it but I haven't moved on it. Also our house went under contract after just 56 hours on the market - and for **above our asking price**. That's great! The house we're moving into my stretch our budget and it's good to know that we won't have to bleed savings any more to get there...**General:** I'm looking forward to moving and having some space to get back into my old hobbies; woodworking models and radio controlled aircraft. I like building things and it keeps my mind occupied...Happy Wednesday people! I won't drink with you or by myself today. (that last part is important for me)
**Triumph:** I've been feeling much more energized and generally inspired by my surroundings. Maybe it's because I'm dating someone that I'm really into. Time to capitalize on that energy...**Struggle:** Binging on junk is still a massive problem. It's frankly a miracle I haven't eaten any of my roommate's ice cream yet. I already ate a bunch of cookies this week.....**General:** I poured myself a cup of coffee this morning and on a whim I decided to add cream. I usually take it black. As silly as it sounds I didn't do it for the taste. When you pour the cream into the coffee it billows in this gorgeous layered cloud that quickly blends with the coffee turning it from a dark brown to a milky tan. Little things like that make the day for me.
If you enjoy those breakfast bars and they make you happy keep eating them Mary! :)..**Struggle:**     SO and I have been trying to plan a weekend getaway for a while now but something always gets in the way. This weekend we're expecting rain - so there goes that. The silver lining? I'm going to renew my passport and go to Ireland!..**Triumph:**     Yesterday in Dunkin Donuts I got my usual unsweetened iced tea with lemon and I surprised the policeman behind me with a large coffee. It made both of us happy :)...**General:**      I finally treated myself (I'm not good at this stuff). I bought a Dior face cream that I've been dying for - and it reminded me of my 'old life'. But I didn't feel guilty I felt happy :).
Struggle: I am still dealing with some very real career problems potentially career ending. Even though I hate that career and am hoping to move on soon I don't want it to end that way. ...Triumph: A new work project (trying to break into a new very difficult and competitive profession) is off to a great start. ...General:  I had thoughts about drinking last night not right away but in some perhaps distant future. They were just thoughts. I did not fight them. I argued with myself a little. The sober guy still wins these arguments.  In the past he always lost. 
Struggle: Im going back to school at 26 years old in less than two weeks and i need to buy a car asap. I fucking hate car shopping and dont know what I'm looking at or what questions to ask people...Triumph: due to tips i make anywhere from 15$ to 24$ bucks an hour so for the first time in my life I've been making a livable wage even if it is dependent on tips...General: it feels like my partner has checked out of the relationship.
Struggle: I've been thinking about my stepfather who passed last year a lot and how I miss his guidance and his laugh...Triumph: I've started writing a short story for the first time in several years...General: Everything is so much better sober and properly medicated. Even with a few bad things that happened it's so much easier to deal with things.
**Struggle:**  Not taking on new projects constantly.  I get excited to do new things make new foods etc. constantly.  And then I end up so stressed out because of course all of these new additions to my days take more time that I did not account for.  And then it seeps over into my relationship since my GF now has to deal with my crappy planning and time management skills.  I am slowly getting better but just ordered 5 lbs of peaches to somehow can really soon and I'm going backpacking for 3 days starting Friday!  Argh!  My rational mind needs to assert dominance over my impulse control!..**Triumph:**  I am reading a ton lately but it does not feel like pure escapism ala drinking.  It actually feels quite enjoyable and has replaced watching TV for which I am quite grateful.  I had some time there when my reading was really an act of escape and not just a fun repast.  I'm feeling like I'm doing a much better job of staying present for my daily commitments so that I can build up success...**General:**  I loove the idea of poem recitations at dinner - that is so reminiscent to me of better days gone by.  Today I am going to finish a small project of blending up my garden basil with some oil and garlic and freezing it into ice cubes for making pesto over the winter.  Baby steps...
Struggle: trying to figure out what exactly ruptured in my lumbar..Win: not drinking to kill the pain (physical)..Other: I got my nails done as a reward (cost was equivalent to 3 days of what I would spend drinking...) and now I can't type very well :D because they did thme long instead of very short lmao..I'll probably rip them off at work. It's aight
Struggle: Doctor thinks mothers cancer may have spread to her lungs. He said it only looks like a few little dots but he wants her to go for tests. Could be nothing though...Triumph: Day 1! Let's nip this problem in the bud...General: Also considering quitting smoking but I think quitting alcohol and cigarettes at the same time would be far too much pressure/stress for me. Think it's best I learn to crawl before I walk. ..
**Struggle:** Disentangling myself from a stressful romantic relationship has been long. And hard. And exhausting. And I still love this person. My anxiety is through the roof about it and I don't know when it will be over. ..**Triumph:** Dealing with a breakup without numbing myself into oblivion is really wild. I might actually have an ex who doesn't wish I would fall off a cliff. I'm still sad about it but we might be able to have some level of friendship or at least civility on the other side. ..**General:** It's a lot easier to read books sober. 
Struggle: I'm really fighting with my impulse to blow fat stacks of cash because I love the little rush I get from shopping. ..Triumph: The new job I'm working is way less demanding and way more supportive than the old job I was working. The extra mental space and emotional energy this leaves me makes it possible to leave work at work and do the kind of emotional support work I need to do to ensure my continued sobriety. (Also just so unbelievably grateful for the clarity to recognize I need to do emotional work to support my sobriety. So that's new.)..General: I had a really yummy lunch which reminds me how much I love cooking.
Struggle: My partner(who still drinks but is so supportive of my sobriety) and I are living in our car currently. The radiator is cracked and we need to get back to work by next Monday but work is 2 hours away. Our friend was supposed to fix it Monday but keeps saying he is too busy but can tomorrow. We don't have enough to go into a chain mechanic or any place that we've looked at. Normally i would be on a bender full of self pity but instead we are eating lunch at the park and thinking up a back up plan plus I'm steering clear of booze!..Triumph: I am working on sobriety every day again! When I left rehab I knew I needed to do this.. Whether it be an aa meeting podcasts journaling meditating now reddit reading a recovery book etc. etc. When I stopped that's when the relapse happened. Making time for me and my recovery is so important and even though I am busy and have so much planning to do. I've still been taking time out of my day for what's important and I'm really proud of that. ..General: I am so hydrated. Flavored soda water and kombucha are so yummy. Also I am happy that I have a support system and that I'm finally allowing myself to feel some sort of empowerment I'm not a failure for realizing I'm an alcoholic I'm winning everyday that I fight it!
**Struggle:** It's been hard to get out of bed to do anything this week and I know I should be getting out of the house more to get endorphins flowing...**Triumph:** I lucked out into getting bumped up when needed to a higher position at my job. It's the first step to a permanent promotion...**General:** I'm still trying to go through the hassle of cheaply replacing my car tire. It's more of a slight annoyance than anything but I really shouldn't still be driving on the spare. Hopefully sobriety will lead me into making better choices .
