**Through a miscalculation when switching from normal to ice brewed beers** to lower calorie intake and also less trips to the store for more beer I believe I may be in light withdrawals. I feel them begin about 9-11am after an evening bought of drinking. These involve high anxiety extreme negative thinking feeling that everything is pointless/hopeless jaw clenching gag-like reflex triggers for no reason....Because of this miscalculation **I have discovered I was not drinking 2 normal beers but actually about 4**. ...I usually only drink 3 days a week but during a week of vacationing I drank every night and though **I didn't think it was a lot I was (adjusting for ice ABV) drinking 8 beers a night.** Then I tried to go back to a 3 day a week schedule but kept messing up my break days because of schedules. In total nearly a month went by of roughly 4 beers a night average....**It was re adjusting to the schedule that I noticed that on days off I want to rip my hair out.** I originally attributed it to my (prescribed) benzo use but since I calendar log every use (as needed non recreational) my usage was too spotty to cause any withdrawals usually less than twice a week. I began pointing my finger at alcohol now here I am....I continue my last case up until I think tomorrow being my final night. **Tapering went fine** but I wanted to know if it'll **help at all when I stop completely. I don't even feel these beers much but they stop the withdrawals for an hour or so** so I hope it'll at least give me a soft landing....**I plan to quit drinking entirely.** Ever since I started a year ago - while it has always been moderate - I noticed a lingering feeling of dread. Researching this past week it seems very possible that my on days were making my off days sucky. To the point where the only thing I was looking forward to was the next night id get to drink. How about that? It creates a problem only it can solve. Convenient. I'd rather just feel better across the board. Also the calories are annoying my abs became much less defined and I have a constant bloat. I also can't find joy in anything like I used to....**Anyways just wondering if this is a waste of time or if it will help me physically with withdrawals**. Mentally there is no real struggle I like alcohol but the cons outweigh the pros so I don't really care...**Bolded for tl;dr**

[Tapering off](http://hams.cc/taper/) might not completely eliminate withdrawal symptoms when you do stop altogether but it is certainly less of a shock to the system than abruptly stopping cold turkey and some folks do manage it although it's often easier said than done... ..The safest way to stop is to see a doctor and be honest about your drinking and desire to stop as there are medications that can make things safer and easier.....I found the book '*Alcohol Explained*' and the book/YouTube '*This Naked Mind*' really helpful for understanding my drinking problem and permanently changing the way I view alcohol - they are well worth a look and made all the difference for me in stopping for good without feeling like I was missing anything or depriving myself... ..Best of luck and keep us posted!..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Good luck with your plan to quit alcohol! I went cold turkey with no gentle moderation beforehand. So I wouldn't really know! But IWNDWYT
