Let me preface this rant by saying that this sobriety business is powerful stuff. I'm feeling grateful right now that I can have these thoughts and not push them away immediately as I have done in the past. Begin rant: I hate not being in control. This is a revelation to me. How did I not know this? I mean I know I can be defensive but I thought I was ok with letting things go of ceding control to others when necessary. I thought I was patient with people but really I was faking it most of the time. I was mostly choking back thoughts of 'why won't you just do things my way?' I thought the relationships in my life (friends and exes) were not satisfying because we just didn't have things in common that there was a communication barrier because of that. Turns out it's because I had my own agenda for how things should proceed and I just didn't like it when the other person disagreed. I thought this was normal.  I never tried to force anything friends come and go right? So I just walked away. Turns out I just didn't want to be in a situation that was so uncomfortably out of my control. So I got this message from a friend today: '... as long as you try to control everything you will never fully know a person. You can't make an accurate judgment about a relationship if you put parameters on it...'  My reaction was to grimace purse my lips grunt and then sigh because damn it he's right. So what the fuck am I supposed to do now? What does this have to do with drinking? A lot. I remember thinking a number of times that becoming an unrepentant alcoholic seemed like a valid option. It would be my choice and that choice felt powerful. Thinking back it seemed at the time like that was the ~only~ thing I really had a choice in- that I had control over. Of course this wasn't true. Quite the opposite I see now.  I thought I knew why I drank. Because I was lonely depressed it was a crutch a friend. All of these are true as well but it's not the whole story. So shit I guess I'm human and not the Vulcan my ex-husband half-jokingly accused me of being. I am not at all ok with this yet. I don't magically know what to do now. On my first day here someone sugggested AA. I responded that the idea of powerlessness didn't resonate with me. What a dumbass. I wasn't ready to admit that this is in fact a huge part of it why I drank. I wanted to keep up the illusion that I had control over something. I'll be struggling with this one for a while. Rant done!

Wow congratulations on your epiphany!  Great work!  ..My acknowledgement that I (a) wanted to be in control and (b) that I wasn't in control led me to (c) efforts to bend things to my will through force guile influence or manipulation resulting in (d) irritation anger and rage when unsuccessful in my efforts...When I admitted these tendencies then I was ready for support and tools.  ..The practice and discipline of applying those brought me to acceptance.  Then finally peace.  ..Thanks for the post.  Something I get numerous opportunities each day to accept not being in control!..Just for today I don't drink with you.
