This morning I stopped at my favorite beer store. I stopped b/c I was thirsty. I stopped to prove to myself that drinking wasn't the issue I was trying to deal with. I stopped because I wanted to have beer. ..When my wife got home I was busted. I was caught in my lie. I was caught in my addiction. I was caught being weak. ..I'm ashamed I'm disappointed and I'm sorry. ..I came here to vent and to unburden myself. Thank you.

&gt;I came here to vent and to unburden myself...Is that the only reason you are here?  Do you have any plans for moving forward?
You can always learn something from a relapse such as don't go in to liquor store or bars...Overcoming addiction is not about strength or weakness it is about finding effective treatment. Do you have a plan to do so?
Best revenge is to figure out the plan that beats what happened today. What's yours?
