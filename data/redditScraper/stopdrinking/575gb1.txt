The post was about working out & how they used 2 run then decided 2 have a run & pushed themselves & loving every minute pushed like 5 miles something like that...Today that post inspired me to get my running shoes back on! Only did 2 miles but wow I too felt strong but since I haven't worked out in a long time I wanted too take it slow! ..I have been struggling with woking out since I stopped drinking but again thanks to that post I'm back on it now. ..I just needed a kick up the ass!..Off for another run tomorrow morning!..
