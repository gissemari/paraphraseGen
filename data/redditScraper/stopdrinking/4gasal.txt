So demoralizing.  Here goes again.

Yes it sucks.. I have so much aweful shit to deal with in the next couple of months. I have to be sober to do it. I won't drink with you today.
Sounds like you could use more support. If I had cancer I wouldn't try to treat myself. Alcoholism too is a deadly disease. What are you going to do differently?
What you did yesterday doesn't matter as much as the decision to not drink today.  Take what you've learned and grow with it.  
Keep trying. I've tried so many times. Just don't pick up today. That's the best advice I have. Drink a lot of water  to get some junk food watch a movie. Just don't pick up
