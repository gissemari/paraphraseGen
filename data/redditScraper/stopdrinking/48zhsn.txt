It sounds like you are taking some good action...particularly coming clean to your husband. I had to do the same thing and it was scary but also very liberating to be fully honest about how bad my drinking had become. Like you I don't have a "reason" to drink (ditto on family nice house good job) and I stopped eventually trying to find one. I just had to accept that I can't drink like normal people do. Good luck to you!.
You haven't disappointed us rather made us proud for getting straight back on your feet and getting on with this...I did the same thing last time made it closing in on a month and bam before I knew what hit me I was drinking without reason. Sometimes it takes us two steps forward and one step back to make it just put it down to experience....Welcome back.
Hey you got almost 30 days.  My biggest fear was that I couldn't get ONE day when I stopped!  You know you can go days weeks.  Congratulations!..Now I know for me an action plan that included support fellowship possibly therapy as you indicated changes in patterns habits and triggers would get me going again.  ..Just think - -   everyone here is pulling for you.  That's a lot support and Karma!
Someone told me that the only way to "fail"  at recovery is to stop trying. I had to be in a lot of pain to surrender. Some of us have higher thresholds than others. Some of us don't make it. At least you're here today.
