Still feel a bit cloudy but am coming around. Yesterday was FULL of anxiety over things out of my control a lot of jaw clenching and a panic attack. I was able to pull it together though with some help and am so happy I did. Proud really. ..Remember you cannot change other people's behaviors only the way YOU react to them. This is what I have been struggling with and had been drinking and having anxiety over. I will repeat that mantra all day today and I will not drink with all of you!

That is a great start.  Keep it going.
I'm proud of you too.  I will not drink with you today!  (Anxiety is such a bastard hang in there!)
You are going through the hardest part right now keep going and stay positive. Take your time and take the time to get to know yourself again. 
Wow you are crushing it! Congrats on your 2 days. Totally agree with your second paragraph. I will not drink with you today.
Hooray you're amazing! I will not drink you today!
Great! Anxiety is the worst. And at least in my case my brain tells me that "you know there is a quick fix..." so not drinking when having anxiety is strong...I'm not drinking with you.
