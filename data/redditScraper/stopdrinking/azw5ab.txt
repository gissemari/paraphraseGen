I just made it through eight days of travel. Part of my trip was spent with a friend of mine. I am maid of honor in her wedding and we went dress shopping...We bought bridesmaid dresses and she picked out a wedding gown...After we bought the dress her parents bought a bottle of champagne. I took one sip after the celebratory toast but no more...I wanted to down the whole glass and then some more but I knew I've come too far to let it all go... especially at lunch on a Saturday afternoon after I fit into a bridesmaid dress two sizes SMALLER (!) than I was expecting...Yes I took one drink of champagne. But I'm not asking for a badge reset. It didn't feel like a relapse and it didn't go any farther. Maybe others disagree with me here. But I feel victorious anyway.

That's a huge victory I think! Congrats that takes a lot of strength and willpower. 
The badge is what you make of it as far as I'm concerned. Congrats! (Also: lolol @ codpiece)

The date of the last drink is not nearly as important as the date of the next.  The coin says "To thine own self be true" for a reason.  Fortunately I don't have to keep track of anyone's sobriety except my own.  If you are comfortable with your motives I vote "power on".  Sounds like it was more torture than escape anyways.
