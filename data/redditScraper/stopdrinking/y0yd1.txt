           It's Friday night and I'm starting out the night with some good Italian food and a big pot of coffee! It's so strange to be sober at 730 on a Friday night but I'm really enjoying the peace and satisfaction. I started lurking here about 6 months ago when I finally admitted that I was an alcoholic. I tried a few times to quit before but it never stuck because I didn't address the underlying issues behind my drinking. .           I'm a 28 year old guy with a college degree and a full time job. Somehow I've been able to keep my job despite multiple "call-in-sick-at-the-last-moment"  days and do well in night classes I'm taking. Relationships have always started and revolved around drinking and as I'm sure most of you know they inevitably imploded with many hurtful things done and said by both parties. I blamed my self-medication on my childhood but I never did anything about those things that were eating away at me. Alcohol and cigarettes were my therapy always there. Always bringing me through. .          This past Spring despite my acknowledgement that I was an alcoholic I spiraled further down than ever. Drunk every night. Black out drunk on weekends. Drunk driving on a weekly basis. I even got drunk around my extended family whom I swore I would never let see my secret. The bottom was when I jumped the fence out back of my regular bar so my friend wouldn't take my keys. I should say I sort jumped it I caught my pant leg on a spikey part and fell on my belly. I got up and the only memory I have after is waking up in my own vomit and finding a hamburger and fries wrapper on the floor. I add this because I'm a vegan. .       A few weeks ago something clicked and the lightbulb got turned on. I was going to kill myself possibly someone else or destroy my future career prospects soon. I used to hope I had cancer so I could have an excuse to die. I always thought about how death would be the final release for me but I luckily never attempted it. Two weeks ago I decided to embrace life. So here I am on a Friday making a pot of coffee and reading all about your struggles and triumphs. To all of the regulars and even the new alchys posting their thoughts struggles and triumphs I say Thank you!
