Great job avoiding the temptation!  You know drinking would not have solved any of the problems or situations you face it would only make things worse.  Update that resume friend and let's just take things one day at a time.  I won't drink with you today.
good for you! drinking would do absolutely nothing to make any of those things better. you'd feel *exactly* the same tomorrow except plus a hangover and the shame that goes with it.  ..I'm proud of you :) lets make it through today too.
Yes!..How'd you do it?
Good luck. .. You have a lot on your plate and I'm glad you made the right choice.  .
The difficult days that you make it through are pretty sweet. Well done!
way to go. Victory for you!
Came through with flying colors nice job!
I would suggest to get those thoughts of drinking out of your mind. Stay on the path you have chosen and see where it leads you. I think you will like where you are headed.
Good job. Hang in there mate. This too shall pass.
Success! It's one you can build on. Next time your anxiety levels sky rocket you will know you've made it through before without drinking.
Well done sir.
