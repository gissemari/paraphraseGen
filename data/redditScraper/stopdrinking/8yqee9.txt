My first attempt at sobriety was exactly a month ago. I relapsed with a friend that I got drunk with the very first time I ever drank (got blackout from day one-hi I'm an alcoholic). ..So far I hadn't been tempted to touch that old whiskey sitting around. But my mom is coming over tomorrow and she's a huge trigger for my depression/anxiety/addiction. ..My husband is out of town. My girlfriend is at a friend's birthday party (didn't trust myself to go). I'm home alone about to dive into the big book for the first time. ..Encouragement stories sage advice welcome. ..But I need to pledge to all of you right now that I will not have a drink with you for this hour. A day right now is a mountain. An hour is a hill. Thank goodness I don't walk alone.

I'm reading a mystery oooh!  I'll read with you tonight.     
I am on day 1 and yes I am facing a mountain that seems like it's growing. I have to keep telling myself it will get better. I have been here before so why do we continue to do this to ourselves?
It take courage to make change.  Good for you for being in action for sobriety. ..I read only the big book and 12 steps and 12 traditions in my first year.  Every rereading was from a new perspective as my sobriety changed and grew month after month.  I didn't worry if something didn't make sense the first time. ..I mostly listened to them streaming for free from AA.org in the car while doing chores taking a walk etc...Be kind to yourself progress not perfection. Be well.
Get rid of that whisky....fast! Lol... but that's me.. a solitary drinker.  Good choices... and that expression " to thine own self be true".
