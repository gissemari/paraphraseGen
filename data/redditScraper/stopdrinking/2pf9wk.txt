This was by far the best I've felt on a Monday in a long long time.  Going from drinking to not drinking has felt like I'm Superman and someone keeps moving a chunk of kryptonite farther and farther away.  I was walking around all morning listening to the most arrogant self-aggrandizing gangster rap I could think of.  I do think that this had some root in my rather emotional inner world right now and I'm still struggling with some negative obsessive thoughts but damn if my internal organs don't feel way better.  ..Extra thanks to this sub especially for Sunday.  My distraction plan fell through and I ended up spending a lot of time here.

Awesome! I'm with you it's a nice change of pace to just wake up and function not having beat the crap out of myself for several days prior.
Kudos man I'm still in the nervous wreck stage but its getting better hour by hour.
