I stopped drinking and taking xanax about 7 days ago but couldn't stop smoking weed. I finally got rid of all my stuff yesterday and am feeling confident and already less depressed..I've been prescribed Librium for the withdrawals and have been feeling okay..I figured I would post here to share with someone going through a similar struggle..I've been going to meetings but don't have anyone to talk to through this as all my friends use daily..I'm thankful this sub exists..Thank you for listening!

Welcome and great job on two days!
Great job already! The hardest part is to start and I have faith you will succeed in staying sober!
