Hey guys!!! Happy Wednesday! I personally have no affinity for camels.  [Happy Hump Day!](http://www.catster.com/molz/funny-cat-photos-10-cats-worse-hump-day-than-you)..WuW is where we calibrate our week check in and see how our SD buds are doing and support each other in our sobriety.  Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type with us!..**Triumph:** I'm a bit over six months sober. That's half a year.  I've been taking some time to really think about what has and hasn't changed these past six months.  I still have a lot of addict-like behaviors and thought patterns that don't really serve me.  Lately I have realized just how secretive I have been about many aspects of my drinking depression and self destructive tendencies.  Part of staying sober for me is being honest with myself and also trying to be more honest with the people around me.  I'm practicing identifying when I'm doing this and taking steps to be more forthcoming and genuine with people rather than avoidant. I've been communicating better with my bosses and my partner and it's been a relief more than anything to actively stop hiding tiny details from people.  ..**Struggle:** Part of the time I think I'm at six months and I am  just over it.   Like I don't care about alcohol anymore I just don't drink it.  And I really believe that and I don't miss it and probably this is dangerous thinking.  Other times I fall into a depression valley and I still find myself thinking  oh fuck it just go get shit faced  before my brain runs through an alternate list of self destructive and/or anxiety reducing list of substances or activities.  ..**General Chat:** WuW has been one of my favorite /r/stopdrinking tools as it's given me the opportunity to stop and analyze my week my sobriety and how things are changing or (as I discovered reading over my past WuW) not changing.  I'm excited to post it every week because I feel like it will keep me more consistent and accountable.  What are some of your favorite tools of sobriety what helpful activities do you really like doing?
----------immediate responses--------

FIRST.. Insomniac posting - yep I'm sober even though I'm not asleep
Good work on undertaking this /u/pandapuddles!  I'll have to ponder my answers over my morning coffee. 
What up pandapuddles? Congrats on that 6 month mark. You did it. ..Triumph: The new job is going really well so far. I have lots to read and study so I'm not getting too much hands on yet but I'm feeling way more confident about my performance than I ever have in a new job before. I'm so excited to learn this new stuff and I think it's starting to show. One big thing I was worried about was the people that worked there and so far everyone has been incredibly helpful and friendly. Another big relief is the companies drug and alcohol rules. They have a zero tolerance law for alcohol so I'm hoping that the people there aren't going to be big drinkers. Starting December 1st I will be able to have health insurance again. Woooohooooo!!!! It's crazy having a real job. ..Struggle: Fallout 4 came out this week and here I am training for a new job. Well I guess I'm just going to have to cut out sleeping. ..General Chat: oh my god fallout 4 is so good anyone else playing it? If not you should be. 
**Triumph:** Shout out to everyone over on /r/sdrunners . Goals and accountability really help me stay focused. I've registered for a couple mid-winter races to stay on track...**Struggle:** I'm also struggling with being open and forthcoming. With my wife in particular. It's hard to discuss my emotions with someone who just doesn't understand try as she might. The friends I've made in sobriety are some of the first that don't come from shared experiences that aren't also her friends. When I turn to my friends who *do* understand it leaves her feeling isolated and cut out. There is a lot I need to work out and understand and a lot I need to work on...**Chat:** The tools that SMART Recovery teaches were really helpful when I was stopping drinking. Now they are really helpful for moving on and making other improvements to my life. Until recently I never had a framework for making decisions implementing changes or understanding my thought processes. Now I do. I am leveraging the tools for so many more things in my life.
Triumph:  I got a new job! It pays twice as much as my current job. More importantly it could lead to a career. Crazy how cleaning up your life can lead to positive changes so quickly. ..Struggle: I'm underqualified. Or at least I have a lot to learn. Also this modicum of success is strangely demotivating. I wanted to drink to celebrate pretty badly so I just ate junk food and napped all day instead. Also I have been procrastinating some important creative work/learning even though it's the focus of my week...Chat: what's even good in a salad? Craving veggies today because yesterday 
**Triumph:**Facing the reality that my relationship is coming to an end and not even considering drinking as an option. That's a completely new thing for me!..**Struggle:**Dealing with emotions that are all over the place for no reason. Hopefully it doesn't last too long...**General chat:**I effing love you guys and I love this sub. I know that it's going to change my life. &lt;3
**TRIUMPH** My patience is growing. I'm less quick to snap or judge. I can feel a slight glimpse of self esteem heading my way! .**STRUGGLE** My sleeping pattern has turned to shit! I'm so tired but can't seem to stay asleep for any real length of time. So so sleepy! .**GENERAL CHAT** I am loving AA; the meetings the people the big book - it kinda seems to be slipping into place for me now. This forum is a daily godsend too. 
Triumph: I'm in my eighth month of sobriety this week. .Struggle: I've got some reasonably challenging 'old' feelings I need to deal with .General: feeling amazingly well and loving that I have finally found that sense of calm all you AA sobernaughts have :-) 
I'm also feeling a lot more honest and a lot less like a shadowy part of me is liable to seize control. I'm also feeling good about where I'm at with my work and my sobriety allows me to relate to the people I work with (some of whom have been sober for decades) in a better way. That in turn has been providing me even more motivation to stick with it and continue to abstain...I'm still struggling mentally in a few ways that I'm working on. I'm "shoulding" on myself and feeling a lot of shame. I've been dealing with this the way I was taught to deal with my general anxiety and depression back before I drank (taking it to absurd levels and laughing at it and otherwise challenging negative thoughts) and I've also been opening up to what I realize more and more is an incredibly extensive and diverse support system of family friends and colleagues...I'm really loving that [rSOYCD](http://sd.bot.nu/rSOYCD/) is back up and running. This is such a great tool for me to read through. 
100 days today. Pretty crazy when I stop and think about how I used to drink and how normal it feels now to be sober.

Triumph: 70 days clean and sober!..Struggle: I'm interested in starting to date again but I don't really know how. It's been such a long time (years) since I tried and now that I don't have the crutch of alcohol it seems even more daunting...General Chat: I really love the daily check ins. Funny how a simple affirmation can have such a big impact!
