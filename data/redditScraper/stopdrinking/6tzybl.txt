Well 302 now I guess :)..Without a doubt hands down absolutely positively 100% the best choice I've ever made in my life.  Everything else pales in comparison...I wish I could share some special secret with everyone who's struggling with it but I don't really have one.  Here's what I will say...DON'T GIVE UP.  I've been at this a long time.  I first took a serious stab at quitting (and actually first joined SD) 5 years ago.  I made it a month then relapsed tanked my relationship almost lost my job etc. etc.  A few months later I tried again.  Think I made it about 2 months relapsed made an ass of myself at a wedding etc.  Went through a rough time there for a year or so then hit another bottom when a girlfriend left me due to my drinking causing me to go on a bender that resulted in almost getting fired again at a different job - I should've been fired but my unique skill set thankfully buys me a fair bit of job security.  That time I quit for 4 months.  Thought I'd figured it out.  Got the pink cloud.  Made some big life changes.  Got in shape etc...Then I relapsed again.  I had it all figured out right?  4 months sober.  Obviously I could now have a few casual drinks and it wouldn't be a problem?  NOPE...About a year after that and about a year ago things got extra scary.  I had a pretty major mental breakdown.  Got suicidal.  I'd been drinking morning to night every day and pretending to function for ages.  Wound up with DTs horrible withdrawal - didn't hospitalize myself but I should've.  Saw a counsellor quit for about 5 weeks then relapsed again.  I hated myself.  I'd just turned 30 had been a heavy drinker since 16 progressing to full blown alcoholism by 25.  Didn't see myself making it to 40 and couldn't imagine successfully quitting so I felt like a lost cause...I remember laying in bed last October half drunk and half withdrawing as was my perpetual state at that point feeling like my insides were rotten and fully accepting that I would die young.  And that was when it became life or death for me.  The next morning I poured 4 tall cans of cider down the sink - they'd normally have been breakfast - and started on my withdrawals.  I didn't do anything special and it was really really hard but in my head now it was life or death.  Either I don't drink today (and only today deal with tomorrow when it gets here) or I die before 40...The first few weeks were as hard as every other time I'd tried to quit.  They just took a ton of willpower to get through each day and some good common sense avoiding risky situations like bars or people I knew would push me to drink.  I became a bit of a hermit and over the next few months I took up new hobbies got super into fitness and poured myself into my work.  For whatever reason after the first few weeks I didn't really crave alcohol at all this time though.  If anything it repulsed me.  That shit was going to literally kill me and I simply would not allow myself near it anymore.  I think my life or death realization probably helped with that...Pretty quickly everything about my life started improving.  I got in great shape got promoted at work met someone special and just felt like myself again.  And since then alcohol just isn't something I consider.  It's like there's a mental block where putting that stuff in my body seems repulsive and scary now.  Honestly the thought of drinking never crosses my mind in day to day life anymore...I've finally made it.  I know what it feels like for alcohol to have zero control over me.  Something that hasn't been the case since I was 16.  This took several years and countless failures to achieve...I guess my point here isn't that it'll take lots of failures.  I know folks who managed to get it right on their first try.  My point is if you do struggle or relapse or feel like it's impossible DON'T GIVE UP.  All that matters is today and no matter what just don't drink today.  Tomorrow it will be easier.  The next will be easier again.  I'm so glad I didn't give up on myself - there was a time when I wanted to and I don't even want to think about where I'd be right now if I had...Jeez that got a bit long when I really just wanted to post something quickly but if this post helps even one person decide to get back up after a stumble then it's worth it.  This really is an achievable dream.  If I can do it anyone can...I now intend to continue on this path for the rest of what I hope is a long and healthy life.  I'm a big proponent of the day by day thing but I'm comfortable telling myself I'll be doing it for life because that no longer sounds overwhelming to me.  In fact considering ever drinking again makes me a bit queasy...Thanks for reading and I won't drink with any of you fine folks this evening!....
