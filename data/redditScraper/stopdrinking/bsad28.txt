I want to drink wine!   Not sure why.   Bored maybe always worrying/anxiety.  Instant gratification .I am addicted! ..The only thing that is holding me back from buying a bottle of wine is the hope of getting better.   And the dread of getting worse.   Wine makes me fat stupid and ugly. I have to keep reminding myself that I can do better BE BETTER.

Hang in there! You'll make it and feel so glad you didn't give in tomorrow. :)
Wait 24 hours and re visit the urge. It has worked for me.
