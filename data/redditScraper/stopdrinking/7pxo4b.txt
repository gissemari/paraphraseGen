Whether you're here to quit drinking forever or just giving up alcohol for a time period for personal growth like me it is much easier if you have a visual reminder of what's at stake...Download the  countdown  app and put in the date you last drank. When you see it's been 7 days or 7 months since your last drink you will be inspired to not sacrifice all that time for a momentary escape. ...Stay strong

I just downloaded the app and I opened reddit to see your post!!   
Absolutely! This is a big motivator to me. My last PR was 30 days on to 80 tomorrow this time around!
Nomo is another good app.
