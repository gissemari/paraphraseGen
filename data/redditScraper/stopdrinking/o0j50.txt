Hi all..Just saying hi.  I have been struggling with alcohol on and off for many years and was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder a year ago which I have been getting treatment for and am now getting a good handle on and feeling better than I have in a long time. However I continue to come back to alcohol even though I know I am better off without it in my life so have decided to join this forum just so I feel I have another forum of assistance to quit...I also look forward to helping other members of this forum in any way I can as I have been through the journey of anxiety treatment combined with a 10 year drinking problem.

Welcome to the subreddit...Long term sobriety is possible if you want it and are willing to put forth the effort to stay sober.
