Around 3 and a half weeks ago my partner discovered that I'd been hiding how much I was drinking and told me to stop altogether. ..The first few days were easy - I gained a strange and sudden burst of optimism and energy I was incredibly productive felt vastly proud of myself and thought it would be easy. Maybe around day 4 /5 it started to get really tough. I'd notice alcohol EVERYWHERE. A glass of wine behind someone in a soap empty can on the side of a street colleagues going for a pint adverts on TV etc.....I made it to 22 days before cocking up and drinking. My partner was an equal amount of angry disappointing and supportive. ..The problem is that every single one of those days after the initial spurt was a constant struggle with thoughts about alcohol at every hour of the day. How long does it take before cravings slow down?

in my experience so far if i don't think of alcohol as an option for the day then the urges are few and far between... and some days they just don't bug me...and they sure do raise their cunning head on few days.....i have read here that people with hundreds of sober days also get the cravings intermittently... guess the frequency of cravings would then depend on an individual's relation with alcohol.. i mean how often one drank how much and what were the triggers... this stuff is a fun puzzle in itself :).. 
It got fantastically easier for me when I started going to AA meetings and finally when I accepted the fact that I am an ex-drinker.  
Progressively and then one day you notice your attitude towards it has changed completly. For me itnwas around the 6 week mark when not drinking stopped being a thing I was working towards and just became part of normality. ..Now just under a year. Alcohol isn't part of my daily thought pattern at all. 
&gt;How long does it take before cravings slow down?..**How long does it take for my garden to grow?** ..I asked a similar [question](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/36xyfi/when_will_i_have_a_day_that_i_dont_think_about_it/) when I was 43 days sober and that was the answer I got.  The cravings will get better when they get better.  There is no magic number of days all you can do is tend your garden until it is grown.  ..In the meantime you can work to develop strategies to anticipate avoid and mitigate your cravings.  One I like that I found here is the [Importance of Not Making Decisions](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/381vwp/on_the_importance_of_not_making_decisions/).  Persevere it does get better.  
For me it got easier when I became comfortable with who I had become without alcohol and started focus on living the life I wanted to live. Getting involved in hobbies and volunteering helped too. 
Those 22 days were not wasted! I had some kind of a mental roadblock about getting to 90 days...it's much much easier now than those first few months. I still get cravings but they are not nearly as strong or difficult to manage. Rock on!
I rode a pink cloud for a couple of weeks.  Then things got dark as my emotional issues rose to the surface...I went to AA and it made things so much easier....It was about 20 months when it occurred to me that I hadn't thought about drinking for awhile....I drank alcoholically for over 25 years so 20 months is pretty quick IMO.
4-5 months before I could go to a pub or party without cravings. ..Nowadays I don't have cravings at all still have nightmares in which I get drunk from time to time.
I just had two nights in a row where my mind was free from thinking about wine.  For me it took 67 days &amp; I have no reason to think it will last.
Are you stopping for you or for your partner? ..My wife asked me to stop and I did for while then lost it by making an exception while traveling. A couple years later after growing into a daily blackout habit I realized that I had no control over alcohol. That finally made ME want to stop. ..I hid booze I snuck booze I made up reasons for a drink. My wife continued to want me to quit/moderate/be good but it wasn't enough.  I had to do it for me. ..As for getting over the cravings? As others said results may vary. I really hungered for it at first. It wasn't day by day it was minute by minute.  Things got easier. I craved it less. The cravings went away but they come back at times. It still hits me now and then. ..Life is much easier after you get some sobriety time under your belt.  Welcome to SD. I wish you the best. 
Cravings lessened a lot after a few weeks. Started to notice a big difference around the 4 month mark as I started to feel more productive with a lot less anxiety. I still think of alcohol once in awhile but it is a lot less often. I have not had an intense craving since the first couple of months and when I do have cravings they are a lot more manageable. I relapsed a few times around the 30-60 days mark and ever since the last time I relapsed cravings have not been intense like they used to be. It just seems like after that last time my attitude and thoughts towards drinking changed significantly. Its like my brain finally accepted that I am an alcoholic.
