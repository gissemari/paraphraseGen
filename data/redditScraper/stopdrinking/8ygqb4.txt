I'm currently living with family in Croatia after living in Serbia for a few months. Finally got myself sober again 24 days ago while I was away in Novi Sad. Life is good -- brain fog has lifted anxiety has all but disappeared and I'm absolutely loving life again. ..Tonight the girlfriend and I are supposed to go to her Auntie's villa for dinner and drinks. We're in Dalmatia and it's the middle of summer which means lot's of food laughter and drinking. It's so easy to be lulled into a false sense of ease around alcohol here. EVERYONE drinks seems no worse for wear the next day and you're looked at strangely if you don't drink. It would be the height of rudeness not to go but I feel like I'm still at a vulnerable stage in my recovery. I'm going to play the tape forward. One drink tonight will turn into 30 a debilitating hangover/self loathing tomorrow and a summer-long relapse. It's fun and beautiful enough without needing to throw liquor in the mix. If I can stay sober in Dalmatia I can stay sober anywhere. ..Thanks for reading. IWNDWYT

Hang in there buddy!  If worse comes to worse and a person is up against a wall and it's awkward as heck and the person does not want to talk about having a problem with drinking:  feel free to pull the health card.   Doctor says it's bad for my health to drink.   It's hard to push drinks on that guy.  Stay strong!  IWNDWYT 
You're so lucky to be in Croatia with the world cup on Sunday! I hear you loud and clear about your situation. You could say that you are on meds and that you absolutely can't drink on them. You could be the driver so you can't drink? Man it's a tough one because I can imagine the situation and everyone is drinking and having fun they love you you love them and you want to share in the revelry. It's like saying you don't love them or enjoy their company. At some point you will have to tell them that you don't drink anymore but you feel that this is not quite the right time. It would probably be better to tell them individually when the pressure is not on for you to drink so next time they will know "Hey tallyrand doesn't drink anymore don't goad him boys." Good luck to you friend. Just get through this event and tell them that you don't drink anymore. I am always complaining about my weight and always dieting so I just say "I don't drink my calories." That seems to work for me.
