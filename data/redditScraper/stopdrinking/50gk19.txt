I still have the odd 'oh what a shame' moment when I see a nice bar (covered in fairy lights - the full romantic shebang) and realise it's not the same and i'd actually be bored and like 'ok I've drunk my coffee/mocktail what now' if i spent Saturday night sat there but all the dread i had and reasons i gave myself for not quitting were just so untrue it's crazy to me.  My sister and I (she stopped drinking a week after me) had a conversation about this....'Before' we both used to have the following reservations:..Boredom.. and too much time in the evening: this is the biggest lie. It worried me but especially worried my sister because she can be lacklustre at times and struggles to find things she enjoys doing ...we thought we would be reduced to jigsaws and wall staring.  The truth is since we have both stopped we cannot fathom how we fit drinking in! There was a short adjustment period but now we are both busy all the time - trying classes completing courses exercising going to the shops or cinema after work (fancy that..driving in the evening!!) and getting things done.  Last night i had so many things i was excited to do i couldn't possibly do them all.  We used to just sit in her kitchen wine in hand actually bored with nothing much to say an evening wasted not really bonding over anything more than a want to get drunk and pretending it was an activity. I wouldn't get that amazing sense of achievement after a night of completing something that made me feel good or just kicking back with a film and truly relaxing to the point that you feel refreshed for it.  There is so much time on a weekend to do stuff then some that I now go back to work actually feeling like I had a few days off and more ready to take on the daily struggles.  Honestly if you worry about this it's true you will feel bored sometimes but boredom is a (temporary) gift and it usually the push we need to try something new.  I don't know where i found all those hours to waste on being comatose.  I wish i had known i would feel this way...Missing out:  on what exactly?  I was reading Allen Carr and Craig Beck and many many others whilst moderating and took the time to really assess whilst drinking each glass what exactly it added....literally nothing..bizarre!!   Drinking in itself is not an activity nor is it fun - i was chasing the buzz i used to get but no longer do - all i get is 0-drunk and very lethargic.  My sister drinks non alcoholic versions in the eve so she still gets the feeling of being involved (her partner drinks each night).  I don't know where this missing out thing comes from but it's scary how deep rooted it is with no actual merit..Quality of life: we both had/have extra lbs to shift we aren't daft we know its 80% diet 20% exercise and given that we are both pretty active but weren't losing anything it wasn't rocket science to know why it wasn't shifting - my sister and her partner share 1 small portion of takeout between a family for goodness sake they eat well but usually fresh produce and never greedily; i on the other hand was trying to diet but not making the headway i used to before the drink.. booze is the common denominator.  Whilst i used to try to alter drinks/food to make weight loss possible (with minimal success since 700 odd drink calories doesn't leave much room for food) my sister outright said 'NO I want to enjoy my life i'll eat and drink what i want' in reality she just didn't want to stop.  Now she still eats the food she loves more of it even but without the drink and maintaining the exercise the lbs are coming off - a deficit of 7000+ calories a week (2 bottles of wine a night) will do that to you.  She seems so much more motivated and fulfilled it's wonderful to see - i can also feel my motivation improving each week and can see myself becoming naturally more active because i feel like it not because i'm forcing myself.  I look at how i have been spending my evenings when drinking - life passing me by in a drunken stupor - that isn't quality of life this is.  I dont agree that being thin feels better than food tastes but i know first hand being toned and healthy feels immeasurably better than any drunken buzz I've had to date...Not enjoying nights out/in with friends: if there are situations I am worried I will find boring without drink it's probably because those situations are just boring to me..all i can do is try it...if i hate it do something else or do it with someone else.  A friend came over one night recently for a catch up we went for a walk had coffee and got into deep conversation - i felt the drunken buzz of connection but without the drink I had an absolutely fantastic time ate delicious food and neither of us spent the next morning vomiting - very unusual... Not 'doing lunch' on a Friday with our obligatory glass or two of wine... I loved the romance (?)..romantic ideation (?) of having a glass of wine on a Friday lunchtime or any lunchtime (regardless of the time) but once i had started the process of considering why i thought a liquid added to my life i started to notice that although the lunchtime wine seemed enjoyable once i left the restaurant and the alcohol had set in i actually felt really tired and drained - all the things i had planned to do that afternoon would suddenly be out the window.. or worse i'd carry on drinking get too drunk too early blackout and end up in bed at 7:30pm then vomit throughout the next day.  We still do lunch - i just drink elderflower presse include a desert and function afterwards like a real life person...These were such big factors in my reluctance to stop i clung to each excuse protectively as fact but in 30 odd days i've disproved each one - i love that these are no longer part of my struggle daily...PS i posted about my irritation and being on the brink of tears only a week or two ago...it did pass I'm pleased to say...have been feeling much happier/stronger this week - will put it down as part of the process. .....

that's great! :) I know what you mean about being bored at bars but I don't mind it so much. I figure there's a shelf life of entertainment any one would normally have at being essentially locked in one room with several people listening to music. any other time you WOULD be like "okay well that was fun but I'd like to go now." alcohol just...kind of expands that shelf life but you're not really having any *more* fun. just the same amount for longer (but is it worth it when you account for the hangover? no.)  ..so I go out I have a few soda waters and then I start thinking "man I'd like to get home maybe get a few rows of my knitting done" and its a great feeling. I always think 'this must be how normal drinkers feel.'.  ..way to go on reclaiming hobbies! it sounds like you and your sister have a really great mutual support system
Thanks for your post so great to hear your story. .I have a thousand questions but I'm so ridiculously tired I can barely keep my eyes open. ..Just wanted to let you know you helped me tonight. I will not drink tomorrow
