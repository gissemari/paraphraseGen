I am feeling worthless and really struggling lately. I went through a break up 7 months ago and I just found out they moved on. I want to drink and let it all go. I just feel so worthless and shitty. I feel like I should be moving on and I can't. It hurts and I don't know how to cope.

I'm so sorry. That's a shitty feeling and there's no way to make it not shitty. My take is that drinking isn't going to make it better. It's just going to make you feel worse in the morning. You're not worthless. You are a fantastic strong person who is wonderful and loved. I'd put on a sad movie and have a good hard cry and a night's sleep. I can't tell you you'll feel okay in the morning but you'll feel better than you would if you got drunk. 
I got hung up on someone who had moved on.  From my experience it is an utter waste of precious time and a colossal drag on the soul.  It's normal to feel bad after a bad break-up.  Feel it and try and focus on the present and look out the front windshield.  It's hard to drive looking in the rear view mirror.  It's like a death.

I m sorry about your pain. These things really truly suck. Remember that you are neither worthless or shitty these are just feelings arising from the breakup now rekindled because of the news. Those feelings are not true IRL facts meaning they will fade and eventually pass. I wish I had a quick fix for you all I have is... it will pass. Even if a part of us maybe doesn t want it to. Stay strong you ll get through it.
I'm so sorry   .It can be really hard to move on but drinking certainly won't help..Stay strong things will get better and you will meet the right person!.IWNDWYT
