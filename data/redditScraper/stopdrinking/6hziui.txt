I feel really low right now... I have been been trying to get my drinking under control for the past few weeks but it's almost like the harder I try the worse it is when I succumb to that terrible voice in my head that tells me to drink. ..I feel so disgusted with myself for trying to hide it from my friends and I hate how my drinking problem makes me feel like less of a person. And I hate how my drinking impacts my friendships and how I'm the "friend to watch out for "when there is alcohol involved... I really want to share with my one friend who herself is a different kind of addict about what I am struggling with but I don't know how...does anyone have any suggestions for how to bring up and talk about these things? Would it even be helpful?..I really just am tired of feeling alone once I close this computer and I hope that if i get the courage to bring it up to someone else it will help. ..I haven't given up the struggle or the desire to stop drinking! But damn is addiction a bitch.

I started by getting a therapist who gave me the support I needed to start getting well. AA meetings gave me hope and put me in touch with others who also wanted to stop drinking. There is help. 
Glad you're here!! I second the suggestion of therapist and AA meetings sponsorship step work. They're great support. I am also in a CDIOP which sounds like some weird robot from Star Wars but means Chemical Dependency Intensive outpatient program. I go to it for three hours a day three days a week. They also make me do UAs or BAs to keep me accountable. That has been really helpful too...I won't drink with you today!
