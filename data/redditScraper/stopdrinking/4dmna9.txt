I've got a cabinet full of booze over my kitchen sink that I haven't dumped down the drain.  I have never been the "if I have it drink it all" type of alcoholic (more the 4 drinks per night *every* night type) and I always enjoyed the ritual of making mixed drinks vs. drinking straight vodka...I quit before maybe a year ago and tossed everything but this time I have a lot of expensive bottles up there (chartreuse drambuie scotch cognac absinthe etc.) and it feels criminal to dump into the sink.  I also feel that I can abstain while still making a cocktail for my wife from time to time...But mostly (and most importantly) I just don't want to be afraid of relapse to the point where it controls my life.  I have cravings like anyone else going through this (for the 15th time...) but I don't want to be afraid of alcohol I want to *choose* not to drink.  My wife made chicken the other night and deglazed with vermouth and although I knew it was vermouth I felt no trigger at all to drink.  It seems like most of the posts here scorn keeping alcohol in the home (and I do understand that there are definitely different stripes of alcoholism) but I want to get to that point where if I find myself alone in a room with a bottle I'm no longer afraid that I will relapse because I know I am in control.  I also don't want to give up food cooked with alcohol but it seems most alcoholics do...At the same time I wonder if keeping my supply on hand isn't my alcoholic brain making excuses so it can relapse easier.  Very confused on this point. ..Thoughts?

Hello. I had no alcohol in my home. Period. I did not cook with alcohol or consume it in any form. I am an alcoholic. I protected myself from alcohol because of my healthy fear and respect for its power. In my opinion your thinking is skewed and risky. My fear of alcohol and support from a therapist and AA has helped me stay sober. Alcoholism is a deadly disease. Recovery consumes my life. 
I moderate but I keep no alcohol in the house.  It's a barrier for me; if I do want to drink then I actually have to make effort to get it...I know several people in recovery who still keep a fully sticked bar and have for years without temptation...So there's no set rule.  Just do what you think is best.  But IMHO you're best to get rid of them
I also still have a lot of alcohol in the house. They're my husbands; he got some nice bottles of whiskey for his birthday as well as some fancy Belgian beers. At the moment I have no cravings at all so it doesn't bother me. I feel that my surroundings don't have to adapt to my alcoholism. It's me who has to adapt to a world with people who have a drink in the weekend. I know a lot of people would think that this situation is not ideal for a recovering alcoholic but for me at this moment it's alright.
Honestly I think you're just rationalizing...I only ever had booze around for one reason: to drink it. I decided that I wasn't going to drink anymore ever so I got rid of it. I don't view dumping your booze cabinet as a sign of weakness that you can't control yourself with it within arm's reach that you must physically remove yourself from it to reduce temptation; I view at a sign of strength. I don't need that crutch anymore. I'm not saving it for that inevitable future relapse because there will be no future relapse. It is permanently irrevocably in my past.
If you have no problem keeping it around why are you asking? It sounds like you really want someone to talk you into getting rid of it. Are all the liquors you named really on your wifes list or are they actually your drinks of choice? It is sunk cost at this point if you are really serious about staying sober why not give it away or dump it? 
I have and have had 3 bottles of wine in a cooler since I stopped. Theyre not on my radar since I don't do wine. Theyre for guests. So it can be done.   . That said I really don't ever want liquor in my house because I did like vodka gins and irish whiskeys. Those would start the over thinking and I know I'd dip in ending up where I started. Same with craft beers/ales. So nope. Hope you can hokd out but if temptation gets to you and still don't want to pour it give it away. 
I've got a whole bar downstairs so I know exactly what you're going through...You are the one who seems to have decided that you have a problem with alcohol.  Therefore you (and only you) are the only one who can decide what steps need to be taken to address that problem...I'm very much reminded of a close friend who stopped drinking years ago.  He did a bunch of stupid stuff over the course of his life and all of it was tied to alcohol.  The consequences outweighed the rewards and he decided he had to stop drinking.  He still smokes pot though but for him he's not doing the stupid stuff anymore so his problem is solved...Most of the people I know in recovery know they can't operate that way and decide to remain truly sober.  For them that solves their problem...I would really caution you against comparing yourself to other alcoholics I did that for years and that's how I got where I am now.  I'd always listen to other people and say "see I haven't done that so I can't be an alcoholic."..I benefit from not drinking and so I won't drink (today).  I'll still take nyquil if I'm sick I'll still eat a rum cake and I'll still have my bar downstairs.  All that is enough for me right now to address my problem.  ..It may be tomorrow I decide that I can't have my bar and not drink.  In that case I like to think I'll get rid of my bar.  It may be that I find out tomorrow that if I take nyquil I start making excuses for why "booze isn't that different I'm not feeling well might as well have a shot" in which case I'll stop taking nyquil...You do you because you're the only person you have any control over.
As you observed there's different types. Maybe you're okay with having the very thing you're trying to cut out of your life right there in front of you every time you do the washing up. I guess it depends- I don't think I would keep a case of the ale I used to enjoy or the gin I favoured lying around even on the pretext of my wife possibly wanting some. Only because I still never know when I might get an attack of the Fuckits or wake up bleak and depressed or feel slightly hyper or fail to respond to a HALT situation and the alcohol would be there making that final link in the chain to relapse all that stronger and more present. I am not planning on making a conscious decision to have a drink again but why take a risk? For this reason all my drinks cabinet was given away when I sobered up.
I still have wine and beer in the house.  It doesn't bother me - in fact quite the opposite - it's a bit like a comfort blanket.  The only way I could quit smoking was by keeping a pack of cigarettes in the house - and I quit very successfully and eventually threw the pack away.  I figure the same principle is working with the alcohol..
My thoughts are that you're still playing with the notion of alcohol and so having alcohol sounds risky for you at this time. ..I say this as someone who has alcohol in my home and has had it since day 1. Where I differentiate from you is that--ultimately--I didn't keep it around because I want to pour my wife a drink (stopped doing that when I realized I was maybe drinking vicariously and certainly enabling her). I don't keep it around because it was expensive to buy either. I didn't throw it out because I wanted to become sober regardless of the environment. If I couldn't have done that or found myself fixated on the alcohol in the home I would have gotten rid of it or moved out. ..Likewise food cooked with alcohol. I didn't start out with that as a goal; but I can add a little wine to the sauce on occasion because it does not bother me. If it did--if I had the second thoughts that you did--I wouldn't do it. And I don't do it when others who are intentionally not drinking are consuming my food. ..If you're very confused on why you're keeping a supply on hand then I think you know your answer. Sounds like you haven't let go of it. ..EDIT: I think word choice is informative. Your title is "...but still **can't** part with my stash" (emph added). You absolutely **can** but you have **chosen** not to. It's a decision you have made. Not an inability. What's behind that choice?
If you think that stuff's expensive now wait until you see the cost of drinking it. ..Thinking you have it under control and that you won't relapse after 7 days is overly optimistic in my opinion. ..I wish you all the best with your continued sobriety.
If you feel bad about wasting it just give it to a friend.
