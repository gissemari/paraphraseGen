Drinking is my method of escaping reality. I used to worry about my coworkers finding out I'm hungover or if the cashier would deny selling me any more beer because of intoxication. I got through work thinking about the next time I get to drink or if I had enough money. I let it control my life. I know I need to make the decision to stop....Now I just feel anxious. I can't breathe my thoughts go around in circles and they don't make any sense. I don't feel good. I don't know where to get help....It's been 3 days since my last drink and and it's really hard to see those days as tiny victories when right now I wish I didn't exist.

I remember feeling much the same way.  There were many days at work were the only thought that seemed to get me through the day was the sweet sweet oblivion that awaited me later that night...Those first few days/weeks were difficult.  I tried very hard to distract myself by having things to do look at watch read.  I bought myself a new tablet as an early Christmas present.  I watched movies that I loved like **Die Hard** **V for Vendetta** **Star Trek** **Fight Club** ...  My wife and I went out to good dinners.  I ate candy.  I ate ice cream.  I drank coffee &amp; fancy sodas...I tried to make being sober as easy as possible: I tried not to do anything I didn't want to do I avoided temptation (we removed all alcohol from the house; I skipped a couple social events) I stayed up as late as I wanted to stay up I slept in as long as I could without getting into trouble at work and I gave myself some slack acknowledging that I was doing something good for myself...For me the struggle of early sobriety didn't last too long.  At some point it became more about addressing the underlying issues that either led me to drink or were what I was trying to escape.  Seeing a therapist and going to SMART Recovery meetings helped with those things.  I do still see my therapist but I haven't been to any meetings in 2 years...Good luck.
/u/JimBeamsHusband and /u/coolcrosby have some great advice. In my case attending AA in the early days was tremendously helpful. Even thought I wasn't sure if I was "down" with the program I went anyway and knowing that I was among people who have been where I was and who understood and who were willing to reach out and offer support and encouragement was instrumental...And also: I'm so glad you're here. Hi! I'm Kat. Welcome xoxo
If you're three days in you are just experiencing natural withdrawals. Your brain is used to regularly ingesting an addictive substance and now it's throwing a fit. (Ever have a caffeine headache?)..There's nothing to worry about. It totally sucks don't get me wrong but it's nothing to worry about. ..If you can't see the tiny victories let me point out one big ass one. You are three days sober! I spent years and years wishing I could just reach that point. You are doing great!..And I'll second what the others are saying here you could probably benefit from meeting other people who have been where you are at an AA or SMART meeting.
|Feels like I'm wearing /u/nothingatall__..at least I hope your name is a Simpsons reference.....Hey nothingatall__ I get it.  I used alcohol to escape.  It wasn't until a couple months ago that I even figured out what I had been escaping from.  Even after 900+ days I'm still discovering new things that I had hidden from myself.  You may feel like shit now but you will get to a point that everything gets easier.  I don't just mean saying no to a drink.  I mean EVERYTHING.  Life is so much better when you can think clearly.  You can do it!
Welcome and congratulations on 3 days! For me it started off rough but got better. I relied on exercise water chocolate and a good book to read at night. I swear it gets easier and more rewarding with each passing day.
Like others said AA helped me. I found out what I was going through was common and there were people who had been where I was and got through it. .
