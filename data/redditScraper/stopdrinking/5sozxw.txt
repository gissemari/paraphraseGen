Hello everyone my name is Arnold and I am happy that I found this subreddit. I have been drinking since 19 and by 23-25 I became a binge drinker. I just turned 30 last month and have been trying to quit for about 4 years but I find myself relapsing and getting depressed after. I am trying to break this cycle. Hopefully I can overcome this. So here's to day one and many more!

I'm glad you are here. I can tell you what works for me.  I read these posts (and on my phone often).  I encourage others.  Oh I got a badge and like my 31 days and the star (weird but true)...But again glad you are here!
Welcome! 
Similar boat myself. Started at 18 binge drinking ramped up in my 20's and I just turned 32. Welcome aboard! Early on can be difficult so try not to get discouraged. You're already doing something great for yourself! I won't drink with you today.
