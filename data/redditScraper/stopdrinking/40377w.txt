Things just keep getting better. .If you're struggling please know there is a light at the end of the tunnel. The thought of me being sober still makes me laugh - that's how unlikely it was to ever happen - but my life just keeps improving. My head is a lot less foggy I'm better organised and my relationships are going from strength to strength. At times sobriety feels like walking around with an open wound - I'm so sensitive to the world to noise to comments to crowds...it can be overwhelming - but I can honestly say my worst day sober is a million times better than my end-drinking days. I'm really enjoying getting to know myself - what I like dislike how I genuinely feel about things on an instinctual level. It's like when that guy takes that pill in Limitless - I tidy read write brainstorm cook plan... My usefulness as a human being has tripled! It's a joy and I really do wish it for all of those struggling today. Stick with it.
