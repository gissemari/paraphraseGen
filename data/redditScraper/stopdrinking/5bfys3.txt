After so many weeks desperately trying to stay sober to just end in a binge I've got that day 7 and this time without any struggle or cravings or even thinking about what my life could be like if I could have just one drink...I found something I care about more than alcohol. I believe everyone has something they can care about more than alcohol. Your sanity your health and body your family and friends and pets your job your bank account debt and legal issues. The ability to feel things you haven't in years from the aches and pains to joy and energy. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let's stick to what's tangible. Things you don't realize how much you care about until you've allowed alcohol to strip you of them. Things youve lost by your own hand...Hell I had nearly none of these still have barely any of them and the ones I had were holding on by a thread a week ago. In just a week I took a thread and started to build a rope to tether me to life...But what I did differently? I put all these things first and will continue to put them first because if I add alcohol to that list it just doesn't fit in terms of importance. It doesn't fit. It isn't important...What is important is a sober life.
