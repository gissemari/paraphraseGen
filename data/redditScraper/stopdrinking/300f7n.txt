From the past two years or so I had realized that weed was a major problem in my life. It consumed me and made me think irrationally. I would only care about when my next hit was coming. After a long time coming I finally kicked the habit and I am about five months clean. Then I decided to add nofap on top of that. When I reached about 100 days of not smoking I was about two months free of fapping and I felt jipped. I was no better off than when I started. I had retrogressed and become a couch potato. Then I took acid for the first time and came out on the other end deciding that I must give up drinking too. I never had a problem with drinking at least that's what I think. I knew that I would drink to get drunk but I never worried that I would have a few shots during the week unlike a few bowls of weed at inopportune times. Regardless of what I thought previously I am starting to think that giving up on alcohol was the catalyst to starting my life on some real progress. Since giving up the drink I just felt great. I am happy and I don't feel down. I have been exercising routinely and eating healthy. Most importantly I studied. I fucking studied. Since I got to college I have struggled to find the motivation to study and the last two and a half weeks I have surprised myself. I pay attention in class and put the work in. I know I can work harder but I am happy that I did at all. I have a test in half an hour and I feel prepared for it. Thanks for reading. Have a great day.

Wow you have really tapped into the force now! All those vices you mentioned have a major effect but for me alcohol is the big one. Freedom from alcohol is the cornerstone of self-improvement. I would place fapping at #2 and weed at #3 in terms of life drain. Congratulations on your new outlook.
