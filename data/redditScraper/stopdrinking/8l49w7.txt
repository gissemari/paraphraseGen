I've been sober since December. Not touched a drop since. So I don't really understand why I still have enormous urges to drink every now and then even though my therapist assured me this is entirely normal. I guess it's part of recovery. ..I hope you guys are doing okay. Stay strong stay well stay sober. IWNDWYT

Hang in there friend! IWNDWYT!
I'm struggling today too but I'm on here to see that I'm not alone in the fight. Thanks for posting your honesty.
It's going to be ok. Stay strong!
It never really goes away but you do get better at handling urges having them less frequently and making then go away faster. Stay strong friend! I always like to indulge in some fast food or sweets to curb the nag if ya will.
