Was drafting my fantasy football team last night and came across this interesting video and article about NFL Wide Receiver Josh  Flash  Gordon...Whether you are a football fan or not there is a lot that can be taken away from his interview and story. I'll give some quick background for the non football fans.  In 2013 Josh Gordon led the NFL in receiving yards and was well on his way to becoming one of the all time greats at his position.  He is the first and only NFL receiver to post back to back 200 plus yard games which is an absolutely mind blowing accomplishment even given his world class Olympic level speed.  What's even more astonishing is he accomplished this feat while under the influence.  Josh  Flash  Gordon had a pregame ritual that involved shots of whiskey bong rips of weed and Xanax.  In fact Josh openly admits that he used alcohol and drugs daily including before and after games ever since college.  Needless to say this type of destructive behavior led him to being suspended for the 2014 season for DUI and failing a drug test.  He was then suspended for the entire 2015 season for using alcohol which violated the terms of his suspension. He applied for reinstatement in 2016 but the league denied it because he failed another drug test. Josh then decided to check himself into recovery which he completed and was allowed to rejoin the Cleveland Browns at the end of 2017. He looked really really reaaaaaally good for a guy who missed 3 seasons of football. Nonetheless according to Hall of Famer Cris Carter he said that he has only seen maybe 10 guys that even come close to Josh Gordons talent level which is ridiculous for a guy who has never played sober in his life...With all that said Josh makes an interesting point in this GQ article and mini documentary about alcoholism and functioning alcoholics. He said when he started attending AA he was surprised at who else was in there. High level surgeons lawyers engineers. Very smart very talented people in their respected field much like Josh himself. It says a lot about functioning alcoholism and how many different types of people all share their own different struggles with the bottle.  Anyway I believe in second and sometimes third chances and hope you guys check out this short 15 minute youtube video I found about it. Also make sure to take a chance on Josh Gordon in fantasy if he slips to the 5th round and ride Flash to your league championship like I will!..IWNDWYT..https://youtu.be/90YP4ntJUQs ..https://www.gq.com/story/josh-gordon-nfl-2017-interview
