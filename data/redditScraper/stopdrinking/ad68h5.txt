So a little backstory. I'm a 31F and I have struggled with binge drinking for about 6 years. I have been in a LTR (13 years) that has seen its issues and my drinking being one of the most difficult. Now yesterday was my birthday. I was successful at not buying a bottle and I was proud (even though I had a slight struggle with urge). My boyfriend and I felt like picking up snacks around 10pm at a local gas station (which was also one of my regular stores to buy booze). The 2 ladies behind the register started to make remarks about alcoholism and was asking if I was always going to the store to buy booze. This threw me off and really upset me that 2 nobodies WHILE WORKING thought it was cute to do that. So naturally I was pissed but I still didn't drink. My bf though said it's my fault that even the nobodies at stores know who I am and should be considered another reason to stay away from booze...Thoughts on how anyone else would have reacted?

Learning to stop giving a shit about the opinions of people is part of living in sobriety. By ignoring or even better laughing about a situation like yours is making you stronger. You should feel proud of yourself for being sober now. You can't change the past so who gives a shit? 
Tbh fuck them   that was super rude and unprofessional of the cashiers and I would tell their manager who cares if they're pissed at you after cause you never have to go there again and see them. Comments like that are offensive and never appropriate. They need to learn to keep their mouth shut if they're gonna work customer service. I'm a little vindictive though...And I'm sorry your bf then turned around and made an uncomfortable situation worse. The first part of quitting as cliched as it is is recognizing you have a problem. And with all of the negative stigma around being an 'alcoholic' it's really really hard to even get to that point. So rubbing your face in it is really not supportive. To give him the benefit of the doubt I'm sure he has his own issues with your drinking. And it's hard to truly appreciate how difficult it is to be in your position unless you've been there...I would feel so bad and wanna go run and hide and cry and drink a beer because I felt like it was my only true friend especially the first few days. But it too is just a two-faced liar :( I did still spend a couple hours crying in my car one day...I am pleased to report that even though it felt horrible to sit there with all these bad emotions stewing they did eventually pass and didn't kill me...You are doing an amazing job! You turned down a bottle on your birthday! High freaking five! And happy birthday! I hope this is the best year yet...Those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind. You've got this.  ..Iwndwyt.
I think that was just really rude of them. I would have been really annoyed too. Like they should just mind their own business...sorry that happened to you especially so early in sobriety but I hope you can rise above these petty bored women.

Looks like you're on track and hurting their sales!
I have learned one true thing in life and that is generally people suck. This was a good example of that. On booze I would have drank the shame away short term and would have found a new C-store long term. Sober we should try to rise above this and other daily affronts to maintain a level of self-respect and self-worth that shows the world we are strong and committed to self-growth.

They probably didn't mean any harm. It would be like if one of the bartenders at my favorite bar said  Aren't you the gentleman who would have two martinis and several glasses of wine and hold court at the bar?   The first time I returned to my  scene of the crime  I was nervous and uncomfortable.  I let them know I quit drinking.  I think anything would have set me off.  After having an NA drink and dinner I left.  Later in my sobriety I found humor in my past and present experiences.  Another example is there are several places that prepared my drink before I even ordered one.  Then I had to have the awkward conversation around I don't drink anymore.  Your headline says it all.  Here's to little awkward reminders that will come up that let us know how bad and/or frequent our drinking was.
