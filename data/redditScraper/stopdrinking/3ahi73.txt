R/all has a post up about Bill W. (AA founder) and his connection to Carl Jung. Interesting. But I made the mistake of reading the comments and I was unprepared for the venom. It got to me. A ton of lashing out on twelve step recovery relapse recidivism. Focusing on the spiritual side of recovery programs etc. I felt defensive and ashamed all at once. And then I knew if I came here I would find relief and understanding. Top posts were all shared experiences beginners people in twelve steps people using other strategies. But everyone sharing the common goal of quitting drinking and being stronger saner and more whole people. The comments here are real encouraging and hopeful. Thanks for posting your stories and for those of you who comment. I'm twenty days in again. Back after a horrendous relapse. I'm using this sub the AA process and art/writing in my recovery and feeling like I am starting to get my mind back. Thanks for being here for all of us who so badly need the support. I can go to sleep now with some extra to be grateful for.

Eh live and let live...And welcome back!
One of us. One of us. One of us. ..Haha just kidding! Welcome back! I always take comments on reddit with a grain of salt (in the general redditsphere). Most are from very narrow minded people who find comfort in pretending the world is black and white. Often there are gems but they are not the majority and they're pretty obvious (i.e. No judgment calls and anecdotes backed up by data considerate of the shortcomings of their view etc...).
