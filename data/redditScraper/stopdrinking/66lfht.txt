I'm sick of this and I'm ready to beat it. I was already struggling with relapse and then I was let go from my job on Tuesday. I lost it and went on a multiple day binge. I can't do this alone. Today I checked into IOP again. I'm going to make this work. Anxiety is sky high now but I'm now sort of hopeful. I just have to get through the next couple of days and this god awful anxiety. Thank you all for still being here.

Not drinking with you dude  
Good to talk to you on here. Not drinking with you.  I am only a few days off my last binge but then I found this place.  Thank YOU for being here for me too
Hang in there guy. The anxiety WILL lessen as you stay clear-headed &amp; learn new coping skills - ones that aren't self-destructive. I won't use with you today. And my anxiety is so high I can barely write legibly bc my hand shakes so much! 
I'm doing IOP as well starting tomorrow after  relapse. 
Tomorrow is my last day in outpatient. It's a relief but scary at the same time. I learned a lot and have a lot of tools. Hopefully I'll remember what I learned. I've also been going to AA nearly everyday. This helps more than anything. Time will tell but one day at a time. I hope IOP works for you. Good luck and not drinking with you tonight. 
Good for you. You never have to do this again. 
Congrats! It started with IOP for me as well. You got this!
Two days down. I will not drink with you today bud. 
I'm really proud of you! Again I'm always here if you need someone to talk to or anything.   I'm really sorry about your job  I've been there and it sucks but you'll find something else.  I can try and help you with that if you want too.  Stay strong!
