Two years ago today I was hallucinating in a jail cell. Since then I've been sober gone back to school earned two college degrees landed an awesome job completely reconnected with my family and changed so many negative aspects of myself. If you are struggling don't quit before the miracle happens. I fucking love my life today. It is AA for me (taking every suggestion and constantly improving my program) but I support all paths!

Congratulations! Two years is a loooooong time!
Good for you.  You're living proof.  
Wow that is such an awesome transformation!! Did you think any of that was possible when you quit? :) What was the hardest period for you in these two years just out of curiosity? Didd it ebb and flow?
