Today .arks day 15. I had orginally planned to do a dirty 30 to show myself I can do this. After how I've felt and this sub I feel like a new me. I'm slowly finding myself. Enjoying life more my family more and overall I've been happy. It's still a struggle but it all starts at day 1. So excited for this weekend. A sober weekend with this special woman enjoying my kids and being able to go everywhere I want to without even wanting a drink. Thanks to everybody for posting on here and keeping me motivated to better myself. I will not drink with yall today. Have a great weekend SD!
