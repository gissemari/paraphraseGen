*Journaled on 7/11/14*..Just stumbled upon this today... a journal entry from a year ago. Hope this gives somebody hope...."I never thought I'd be alone at the age of 20. College has been rough on me. I make good grades (3.0+) but my social life is shit. I feel uncomfortable most places I go to. The highlight of my days are coming home and simply passing time alone. High school had so much better days where did everything go? I don't think anyone values me so I put value in my life with drugs. At least they're always there for me. I feel nothing. My face is expressionless. I like the comfort of being sad. Nobody understands me or knows what I'm going through. I can't remember the last time I had a genuine laugh or for that matter woke up and though I was going to enjoy being alive. I've just wanted to be involved in something and had a sense of appreciation from others. People don't text me back. Of the most recent 13 phone conversations 12 of them were outgoing. Why am I never the guy that people are excited to see? Why does nobody want to meet me? Like I'm sure people bump into each other and realize that they are similar and hanging out with them would be enjoyable and then one of them mentions something they are doing and invite the other person. I have never had someone who genuinely wanted to get to know me. Nobody wakes up and think of the name XXXXX XXXXX. I'm a nobody. My ego and drive are completely gone. I don't care. Nothing matter to me anymore. I can't find many things that I actually enjoy doing instead I walk around and put on a fake image in front of others. They don't know that I cry myself to sleep. I don't want to be awake but I don't want to be asleep either. I feel nothing all the time."..Stumbled upon this journal entry from over a year ago tonight. My how a year has made such a difference. Anyways this is my first post so thought I'd give a little insight. I went to rehab in October 2014 when intervened on my my mother and therapist who thought I wouldn't be alive at the end of the fall semester at LSU. This was my 3rd year there and I thought my best option was to kill myself but didn't have the courage to do it. Things were so dark then and I had no idea this way of life existed. I enjoy being alive right now. I've had my struggles but I'm currently 105 days clean. I hope this helps somebody because it reminds me where I come from.

Thanks for sharing likeabadjoke! Seems like you were really hurting back when you wrote that..Once you get some time and your head clears up it can be easy to forget what things were truly like in the problem. Reading that was a good reminder of how I felt before I decided I needed to make a change..Keep coming back!
I love and recommend writing in a journal for just this reason. It really puts me back there back then if I *ever* think--*well it wasn't so bad was it?*..Thanks for this share and glad things are going well right now.
