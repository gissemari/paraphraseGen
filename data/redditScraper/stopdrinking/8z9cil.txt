TL;DR - made a fool of myself blacked out nearly died on work do and now need to go teetotal. ..I've finally hit rock bottom with my binge drinking. I feel like crying. Throwaway account due to embarrassment...I've always had a love/hate relationship with alcohol. I've always been a bit over the top with my binge drinking I never know when to stop and always seem to get into messy situations make an absolute fool of myself and wake up full of regret. This weekend though takes the biscuit. I think it's time to go teetotal...I went out for a work do some of us started drinking at 9am. It was a downward spiral from there. It all gets a bit hazy in the afternoon as I hadn't had much food. After the party we all kind of split up into our own groups and ended up in different bars. I can recall some of the cringey conversations I was having with work colleagues. I dread to think of the absolute rubbish I was talking or real personal stuff I was telling people that I can't remember...I work 15 miles away from home I remember getting texts from the 2 guys who live my way who I was supposed to get home with saying they had already left. So I continued to party and must have missed my last train. I have walked the 15 miles home before all night. So I must have thought this was a good plan this time round as well. As said I don't remember leaving the last bar. My phone last synced at 23:55 so it must have been midnight or later after 15 hours solid of binge drinking like a fish. Next thing I remember I was walking up a country road with no streetlights finding my way home trying not to get run over. I remember jumping over a fence to get into a field to avoid getting run over. Falling over a lot. I lost my phone and my wallet in a field somewhere. Got naked and masturbated in a field. Got electrocuted by several electric fences along the way. Ripped my jeans from top to bottom from what I can guess was climbing over barbed wire fences. I was covered in mud and blood and cuts and bruises. When I finally recognised where I was I had walked 6 miles in the wrong direction and was miles and miles away from home at around 4 in the morning. I was hungry so so thirsty no phone no wallet but with enough change to catch a train towards home. No trains would be running for hours though. So I decided my best course of action would be to re-trace my steps to find my phone and wallet get back to where I had come from and take public transport home the next morning...Well I went the wrong way again I couldn't remember where I had  literally just walked from! Ended up walking another 5/6 miles out of the way. But at least I knew where I was. So ended up walking the next 6 miles to get back to where I started the night before catch the train then bus home. I eventually did find my wallet it was in my pocket. My phone is nowhere to be found though. I don't know how I didn't get run over or arrested or wound up dead in a ditch somewhere. I actually feel pretty lucky to be alive. ..Every step of the 18 mile all night long walk of shame I was telling myself "This is it I can't drink in moderation I don't know when to stop the universe is sending me a sign here. I really am never drinking again"..I have spent the last 3 days feeling like crap catching up on sleep rehydrating ordering a new phone and changing all the passwords on my accounts to make sure nothing gets in the wrong hands. I had to throw away everything I was wearing as it was just totally ruined...I'm really dreading going back to work tomorrow. I have no idea what conversations took place or what I said or did. For all I know I could be dragged in to HR first thing and told to pack my desk up and leave the building. My memory is a complete black out. I've a feeling I have some apologising to do but I can't even prepare myself because I can't go through my phone messages to see what shite I was talking...For me personally I could easily take or leave alcohol. Weed has always been my first love. But the peer pressure of all the events that family and friends go to. The fact that drinking seems to be the norm. Christmas birthdays weddings..... Reading all the stories on here of having to explain constantly that you don't drink and why. People going on dates and being knocked back when your date discovers you don't drink. It seems like a really scary and lonely world to be in. I'm afraid I wont have the willpower and will relapse...The only time I don't drink too fast or too much or embarrass myself is when I drink at home alone. That's the only place I am happy with my drinking habits. I am able to drink in moderation only on a Friday/Saturday. I'm also at home so I'm safe and sound. So I'm thinking of sticking to just that. But will that maybe blur the lines as it's not a complete "I'm teetotal". Maybe that could be my rule but I just tell people I'm teetotal. As trying to explain that would be a nightmare...I don't really know why I'm posting this. Probably just looking for some validation that I have a binge drinking problem giving up drinking outside the house is a good idea. And that there is still a world out there for me when people new or old discover that I no longer drink and why...If anybody has read this far then thank you for reading. Sorry for the wall of text. I just want a big hole to open and swallow me up!
