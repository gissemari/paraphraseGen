Yes I had a few drinks but didn't try to finish the bottle with my hubby. I really tried to focus on the taste and it was terrible! I realized I hate that out-of- control feeling I get when drinking it's not a stress reliever at all! My mental state is fucked the next morning. It's definitely a dangerous situation for me having been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. Something new I've had the past month is the shakiness the day after drinking. That scares the hell out of me. .So here I am on day 1 for the umpteenth time but new perspective ready to do this. Back to reading This Naked Mind and asking hubby to move his "bar" down to the basement so there should be no reason for me to see it. I think that's a good start.

I drank alcohol because of the effects. The taste was seen as a necessary evil. ..What's going to be different this time?
Yes! Good start. One day one moment at a time. 
great post. Good start! I loved the taste unfortunately...but it IS a day at a time. Changes are difficult but you can do it! Good luck!
Well yes I agree with liking the effects of alcohol in the beginning but I'm really taking notice of how my anxiety shoots up. I don't know if it's always affected me that way but I ignored it or if now since I'm trying to quit I'm tuned into any and all the negatives. 
As I was told in rehab relapse is most of the time a part of recovery.  Most people won't get it the first time I'm on my like 2000th time. Good luck and try to just stay away.
