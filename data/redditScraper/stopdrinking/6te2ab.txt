Today was day 29 of not drinking. ..This weekend i spent with my partner in the country on a writing retreat. It was beautiful. While my partner is still at the rented coutry cabin i had to leave for a work meeting. And here i am on my couch in the city with 3 long necks of beer...I fought so hard to not buy the beer but i gave in. I walked out the door to get alcohol free beer to settle my temptation. I walk in to the bottlo after withdrawing 20 dollars from the supermarket. I knew i was going to buy beer. Inside i kept saying "1 long neck and then alcohol  free". Then i saw the sign saying "three long necks: special 20 bucks"...So here i am. Drinking my beer. I am going to go to an AA tomorrow night because on my own i have no control. Im going to get a sponsor and do this properly. ..Any tips on telling my partner i failed tonight? Also any tips about starting a new job as an alcoholic where they do friday night drinks? A disjointed post so if needed can clarify. ..Also stopdrinking is ny favorite sub.

I think something to commend you for is that while you relapsed you are very aware of what you did and want to get better. That is a hell of a lot better than what most people can admit. I have so many friends in rehab that relapsed and I keep telling them that what is important is that they're back and are committed to getting better. That's what matters is that commitment. It might be important to acknowledge what set you off what triggered you and the actions you took. Taking note (like writing it down or whatever) could possibly help you process and explore options to prevent it down the line. Doesn't work with everyone but for me personally I find it useful...&gt; I am going to go to an AA tomorrow night because on my own i have no control..In AA the first step is to admit you are powerless. You seem to be right there already. You may not get the sponsor you desire but just keep trying. I have been lucky with mine so far but I know people that go through a few before landing the person that clicks with them. It's okay to be selfish in your recovery...I don't have any special tips on telling your partner. It's just something you have to talk about with them and tell them that you in fact can't do this on your own and you need help. Hopefully they'll be willing to support you through this next part in your life. You might want to consider letting them know that it's *your* recovery; I don't know your partner so I can't comment as to whether or not they play a codependent role or what the dynamic is between you two when you drink but they should know that you need to focus on yourself primarily if you want to get better. A lot of time us alcoholics are so concerned and bothered by outside things and people that we forget that recovery is about *us* and that it is *our* problem and *our* health...For your job I know that can be tough. There's no real right answer here; it's not realistic to go out and say that you're an alcoholic to everyone. But if you stay there and don't drink you could easily get triggered. You could try just not joining on Friday nights but that might not be seen as good communication with coworkers. Whatever you do is going to be risky but just remember to make sure it is *your* decision.
When you start a new job  I would ust say I don't drink from day one. Nobody cares about strangers who don't drink it is former drinking buddies who get pressured.
