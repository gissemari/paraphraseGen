Post your triumphs struggles and complete nonsense. ..--- ..**Triumph:** Signing the official adoption paperwork today for my pup and got a significant tax refund (which will almost all be invested in her savings account).

One more week and I get her into training classes which she so desperately needs. ..**Complete Nonsense:** I started a budget!?!.

**Triumph:** Spring cleaning underway! I am rested a bit more!..**Struggle:** Had two days off because I was sick. In all reality I was completely exhausted and run down.

I'm happy...Struggle: Since I quit drinking I have become obsessed with my work as a musician and spent day in and day out practicing or at rehearsals or booking or doing studio sessions and since I've been with my girlfriend my work ethic has been slipping since I spend so much time with her. I don't want that to slip as I know sleeping in and becoming lazy is what triggered my want to drink in my drinking days. I must gain strength to not spend time with her 24/7 and allocate proper time to work and spend with her. ..Complete Nonsense: The love letters I write to her are helping me get back in the habit of writing which is something I've neglected over the last several months. Good stuff.
