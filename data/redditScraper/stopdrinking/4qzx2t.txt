*An old Cherokee is teaching his grandson about life. "A fight is going on inside me" he said to the boy.*..*"It is a terrible fight and it is between two wolves. One is evil - he is anger envy sorrow regret greed arrogance self-pity guilt resentment inferiority lies false pride superiority and ego." He continued "The other is good - he is joy peace love hope serenity humility kindness benevolence empathy generosity truth compassion and faith. The same fight is going on inside you - and inside every other person too."*..*The grandson thought about it for a minute and then asked his grandfather "Which wolf will win?"*..*The old Cherokee simply replied "The one you feed."*...------..I had a shit day today. I struggled with wanting to eat my feelings (binge eating disorder) and I was throwing a tantrum in my mind all day. I asked my husband to watch our son so I could go socialize with people at my local yarn shop. ..Nothing seemed to help me. I wandered from the yarn shop to the book store and all I felt was anger and a storm growing. ..I decided to head home and just eat something at the house. "Just get to the house and make dinner and reassess."..My husband had a bad day as well and is joining me in this journey of not drinking but we're all human and he admitted (reluctantly) that he really was craving something to drink. ..At that point I hadn't wanted it or thought about it but since he brought it up I suddenly had a nasty thought start weeding itself into my mind. "Just go get it! You've earned it. You might as well get a pumpkin roll while you're there too! You've been craving one for a while..." is what the thought was telling me. ..For 30 minutes I fought in my mind. My husband said he was taking our son on a walk and I told him I was going to the store. ..I practically ran out the door and jumped in our van turned on the ignition and....sat there. The battle my mind was fighting caused me to shake the steering wheel with anger. I wanted nothing more than to dull my mind and body with booze and food. ..I pulled out of the driveway cursing myself. ..I drove to the end of our yard and....turned around parked the car ran inside and leashed the dog grabbed my sunglasses and a water bottle and ran to join my family. ..**Today I fed the good wolf and I am so proud of myself.** [I would have missed a wonderful 2-hour walk with my family.](http://i.imgur.com/6YoeYEl.jpg) ..I will not drink today. ..----....Bonus [tired puppers.](http://i.imgur.com/LXgoBuz.jpg) She's a good girl.

Nice work!  That's awesome.  :)
Yess!! Go you! 
That's fantastic! Love the pictures too
Awesome wolf tale! I'll remember that one (well because I saved the post)..Strong work on good decisions.
Way to be! Sounds like you got through a stressful day *and* made it awesome. Are you a knitter or a hooker or bistitchual? I took up knitting in sobriety and it's like 90% relaxing 10% its own kind of stress. But at least I (usually) end up with something to show for it!
Good.
