So I've fought the good (but hard as hell) fight for two years now. I still struggle from time to time with the decision as to whether I quit drinking too soon. If I could safely return to a life with alcohol. I'm still not sure. But regardless today is a day to celebrate. ..Thanks to all of you for your support.

I questioned many times if I could safely return to alcohol. "I have control of myself now I can moderate myself". I never could (and can't) it was a sweet little lie I told myself to feel less powerless from my inability to drink moderately.    .    .Glad you hit two years and hopefully you will be here for mine. Not drinking with you today and congratulations for that.
Congrats on your 2 years!! I quit drinking at one point in my life for 30 years not one drop. Started up again not too bad for the first 6 months but the last 2.5 years it is as if it was yesterday binging blackouts and other problems. Lost my relationship.. Quit again.. for me I can't go back. 
Congrats!
Congratulations on two years :)
Congratulations! Also its better that you may have quit too soon than too late.  
Congratulations  this is awesome 
Whoa congrats! You're an inspiration. 
Never met anyone who quit too early. A ton of people who hit too late though. ..Congrats on 2 years!
