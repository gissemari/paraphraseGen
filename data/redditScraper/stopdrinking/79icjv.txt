And I'm beginning to understand why having support groups like these is so helpful. In the past when I tried to quit but ended up slipping up I would go on a binge for days because 'who cares what does it matter'. I didn't have anyone to be accountable to except myself and I certainly wasn't strong enough to stop me. ..But today in addition to feeling like crap physically I now also had to get my badge reset. And typing out that request was a lot harder than I thought it would be. Now that I realize I'm not in this alone I feel like if I slip up I'm actually accountable to someone. That is going to keep me on the right path as I begin day 1 again.  I will not drink with you all today!

I read your post and hope you follow through with your commitment.  We're pulling for you! 
I had the exact same reaction when I reset. It felt really bad. The community is what keeps me going! IWNDWYT!
So good you are right back fighting the good fight with us. 
My badge used to be three digits starting with a 3. I feel your pain. So glad you're back! 
Glad you are back! You've got this.
Glad you're back! I won't drink with you today!
My reset was a big learning experience for me.   I hope yours was educational too and I'm glad you are jumping right back into sobriety.
