I have a little over 5 months sober and work the AA program. But these last few weeks I have been struggling nightly with thoughts of getting high or drunk. It's really wearing on me and I feel like any day I could break and just say fuck it all I don't want that but these cravings are really getting to me.

Sponsor? Meeting? Working the steps?..My advice accept this as a part of the process of recovery. I had weird cravings at around 5 months. I had a thought of going to the liquor store to "see what was on sale". I got really scared. I didn't want to drink. I cried. ..When I get cravings I sometimes get hard on myself. I think oh fuck I'm not working the program hard enough I'm in relapse mode. Fuck fuck fuck! But that doesn't help that's just part of the addict trying to strangle its way back into my life...So I take a look at my list of things I need to do and see what's missing. Meetings? Am I drinking enough water? Etc etc. And then I correct. "Oh I haven't had lunch today!" Or "Damn I've been hiding my feelings about something I need to talk to that person"..Then I remind myself: I'm a fucking alcoholic and cravings happen. The only thing I can do is take inventory reach out and calm the shit down...You don't have to drink over it :)

While not all drugs are created equal they are all drugs AND all when abused will take us to places we do not want to go...It's not like you were offered a job as wine consultant to the royal family of Monaco.  Your inner addict wants to get high. Period.  You inner addict knows how to lie.  You are starting to believe the lie...Don't believe the lie.
