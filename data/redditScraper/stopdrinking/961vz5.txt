So I am 11 days in.  Not far at all but not where I was.  I'm struggling with the feeling that so far I've settled for everything in my adult life.  Everything I have now (job relationships etc.) is all I could manage being a. Drunk or b. Hungover every single day the past 8 years.  So it was enough..... I feel like I'm too new in my sobriety to start a major undertaking like grad school or any other change.  Does anyone else feel like this.  I feel like I could've accomplished so much more than I have.  I've wasted so much of my good years.  When is the right time to start over and become accomplished or feel fulfillment in areas other than sobriety?

The best time to plant a tree was 10 years ago. But the second best time is today.
