Just curious so see how many of us NYE sober babies are left. How ya feelin'? Any withdraw symptoms left? Still feel as strongly about quitting as day one? or more/less? What do you think played a big roll to get you to where you are today? Relapse/reset your badge? I hope everyone is doing well! We got this :)..High Five

Jan 30th 2015.  Feel great  only battle left is that sometimes i get bored and want to drink to satiate that.   Otherwise I'm going strong. 
I started Dec 30 but hit a bump on Jan 8- back at it full force now. That bump actually changed the course of everything and I came back with more clarity determination support and a much better plan in place. I admit to being sad I'm not closer to my star as a result but I think in the long run that bumpy first week was for the best.
I'll check in! ..I feel great. My biggest reason to stop drinking is because [I realized I cannot drink and live the life I want to live](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3z7w86/i_can_either_drink_or_live_the_life_i_want_to/). Since New Year's I've doubled down on many areas of my life particularly exercise professional development and creative pursuits. ..The one piece of advice which really stuck from the [baby steps post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) is to create a physical ritual to reinforce my sobriety. I've started a daily journal where I do three things: 1) Remind myself why I quit alcohol and reaffirm my commitment to a sober life; 2) Commit to small decisions to improve the overall quality of my life (eg: I will go for a run today or I will write); 3) Commit to contacting someone in my family or network of friends even just to say hi. ..The ritual is so important to me because it's the manifestation and proof that living a sober life is the only way I can live the life I want to live. I AM the type of person that doesn't drink; I AM the type of person that makes incremental improvements to his life; I AM the type of person that forges strong relationships with the people he cares about...What about you [u/RedHeadedRiot](https://www.reddit.com/user/RedHeadedRiot)? I'd love to hear your thoughts!!..
January 1st was day one for me. My initial plan was to take 30 days off. It's been going pretty good. It's becoming harder as the days go by though. I have more clarity.....been working out a lot more and that feels pretty good.
I'm still hanging in there NYE was my last drunk. Feeling ok great not having hangoversbut starting to get a case of the fuck it's. Had to take yesterday minute by minute for some reason I woke up wanting to drink and that didn't go away till I was in bed last night. I went to bed at 9 to get the crappy day over with. I haven't lost any weight I haven't stuck to any exercise routine I need to start that! I've stopped this long a few times before last summer did 90 days then start thinking I can drink moderately now! I wasn't that bad! See self you're not an alky! Then get blackout drunk everytime I drink. I have to be done.
In comparison to this time last and the year before I feel  like a rock star lol. ..I am still figuring out what damage I have done to my body and dealing with the consequences of my actions. ..I feel about the same on quitting not that I am putting on the back burner but now I am focusing more on my overall health (liver issues and therapy). I haven't had many cravings or urges. I have only had 3 days that were emotionally unbearable for a hot minute. ..I find yoga staying busy and having a routine is key for me to stay on track. This SD is the thing that planned a huge roll in getting to where I am today. I have tried different ways of getting/staying sober and nothing has worked for me like this has. Which brings me to the fact that I did relapse but it brought me here NYE but not since then...I like finding inspirational quotes and sharing them. I also am excited that I am  rediscovering myself. I lost myself somewhere along the way to being 26 and as I discover my pieces I am remembering how happy I was and I am striving to reach that happiness again...u/amorras-the-free ..PS. I tend to ramble lol
I decided back in October to quit for good but that didn't stick. I continued to spiral downwards into depression and I knew that drinking was no longer sustainable so I made NYE my next quit date and it has been working so far. I still deal with anxiety but much less intense than the withdrawal period anxiety. I sleep MUCH better and completely unaided now. ..I've spent my entire adult life as an alcoholic isolating myself from other people and burning bridges. I disagree with the entire foundation of the Twelve Steps so AA isn't really an option. So as you can imagine this journey has been a lonely one but I think sustained sobriety will give me the tools to be social again eventually. Cravings are fairly easy to manage now as long as I take it one day at a time and not think too much about the future. ..Good luck New Year's sobernauts! I hope to see you all in r/dinos this time next year! 
I had my last drink on NYE.  I am doing well.  Some days are hard though.  That's when I reach out for support and I get through it. 
NYE too by coincidence but it is probably the best timing possible. Not many temptations in January. This is my first real attempt at quitting the other times were  more like challenges that didn't work out as I knew once the challenge was over I would find an excuse to go back where I started. The sobriety journey is peaceful so far it's a much more exciting and interesting life compared to my groundhog drinking days. ..The support here is amazing and helpful when I started drinking nobody even heard of the internet and AA was incredibly anonymous I'm glad it's possible to get support this way. Let's do this!
My last drink was on Jan 3rd. I should say last *binge*. It took me a good 3-4 days to recover from it. :-/ I'm feeling great and my resolve to stay sober is stronger each day. I'm so much more present with my daughter and much more focused at school. I've been working out regularly. ..Being active here has been key to my recovery. Telling my partner and therapist that I'm an alcoholic also helped. It made it more real I think. During previous attempts to quit I would keep my plans to myself which made it so much easier to say "fuck it" a week in and start drinking again. I had no accountability.
January 1st was my first real commitment to quitting drinking. I've messed up twice since then which is disappointing and embarrassing. However unlike other attempts in the past where a slip up would be an excuse to go right back to old habits this time both slip ups were followed by an immediate commitment to get back up and get back at it. I feel stronger as a result. After today I will hit the 1 week sober mark for the first time in years and I don't plan on slowing down after that. Congratulations to everyone in here for staying strong for all 23 days so far - that's a huge achievement. 
1/1/16 was my quit date. Still plugging along. Most days feel good/solid in my sobriety but there are definitely waves of wanting to drink and having thoughts that this time maybe I can moderate. I know I can't. I've tried every angle to try and keep drinking and it always ends up the same me drinking until I pass out. One thing I have really enjoyed about sobriety is waking up sober with no hang over. Love that :-)
I'm still here :)  Happy that I haven't had any real urges to drink which amazes me.  My body is healing from the damage from drinking - pounding heart went away around day 3 blotchy face around week 1 and yesterday I noticed my arrhythmia is gone.  Still have asthma eczema and 35# to lose.  And fatigue! but slept 9 hours last night for the 1st time in 2016 so maybe it will improve soon.  SD and SMART have been such great resources.  I've spent almost all my free time on these 2 sites.  Glad to see so many of us are still here!
Jan 1st was my first day. I also included diet and exercise at the same time. I get cravings but the good thing since I cut out sugary and fattening foods along with the booze.. my cravings are for chocolate cake more than booze. ..Been exercising to fitness DVDs and starting my 3rd week on that today. Lost 9lbs so far. 
I'm a day late to the party but it's going well. I'm proud to say I haven't had a drink of alcohol in 22 days the longest I've had since my original relapse a year and a half ago. Things are going well. The only thing that's worrisome is how easy of a time I'm having staying sober. I've been committing each morning to staying sober and reading/posting on this subreddit reading a recovery debate group on facebook keeping in touch with a sober friend. I may start hitting some AA groups for fellowship but we will see :)
Big *high five* to all of you let's keep it going!.
Dec 30th laid in bed depressed drinking thinking.  Something my son said was chipping away at my will to drink.  Made a decision that night..Been healing with food sleep reading meditation this sub.  Cried my ass off for weeks.  Feels like it's time now for other decisions to be made and I'm excited and scared.  .High fives to you RedHeadedRiot.  Thank you all for being here sharing your stories offering encouragement and advice.  This place has been a warm cozy cabin in the cold. 
In a way I had really bad anxiety at the NYE party.. I felt nervous talking to people and was almost shaking. I had been drinking for days and doing research about how alcohol increases anxiety and depression. On Jan 10th I decided to clean up my act. 
I'm still here and plan to be here for many NYE's to come.  I look for your posts /u/RedHeadedRiot...My strategies are -- Morning Check-In's posting when I've got something to say I either think they might be useful for others or when I need to call myself out on something (or both).  That's been a great accountability measure.  Honestly others' relapse posts -- there but for grace go I -- and they also allow me to drop into compassion for them and myself.  Seeing how many stories and paths and holes have landed all of us in this place.  None are better none are worse.  Some make me feel grateful some make me feel sad.  But we're all here together.  I overheard someone sitting in a bar once disparage an obese woman who was slowly jogging by and I thought to myself "At least she's out there doing something not sitting on her ass in here drinking."  No matter where we are each starting from we're here.  It's important to me that you're here with me I hope it's helpful for you that I am too.
Early in the night/morning of December 30 I woke up after drinking with a friend to an alcohol-anxious panic attack that I decided would be my last. One-click Kindle-ordered Stop Drinking Now read most of it under the covers around 4 am spent NYE sober now 25 days in. Texted my bff who quit 36 hours later and is on this journey with me. &lt;links pinkies&gt; I'm so happy to have a friend whom I can text at any time with any anxiety that I'm feeling as well as this sub which she introduced me to. ..I'm meditating exercising eating well reading lots and am spending way less money on this awesome world of nonalcoholic beverages than I spent on booze. We went Fancy Tea and Teapot shopping last night and made myself two pots last night.
I'm a little behind you but I'm sticking with it. Last night was tough and I was THIS close to having a drink. Turns out I was just thirsty but not for alcohol. I drank a bunch of sparkling water and that satisfied my thirst. And I was so happy to wake up this morning with no hangover and my three week badge! Keep it up everyone!
Yes I did start on NYE. Going well. day 25. Did think about wine a bit yesterday but not really tempted. My plan was to stop drinking until I hit my goal weight which requires me to lose 35lbs. Have lost 9 so far. Was the heaviest I have ever been and I don't see myself as that overweight person. Have always been fit and slim. .In truth the weight goal is primarily a public face to other motives to sd such as worries about various symptoms (stomach etc) constant hangovers affecting work and other performance a deep feeling of morning after regret for no obvious reason you all know the list so I won't enumerate it all. .My longest period of no drinking in the last 15 years maybe longer was 1 month off post surgery a few years back.  .Am getting blood tests soon. Liver count will be interesting. Who knows what surprises are in store for me with the bloods. .Have been exercising regularly getting fitter again. Have been watching my diet the last week. Got a Fitbit which I find very useful for monitoring and feedback - food sleep exercise. .Started yoga again the other day that made me feel great. Have been trying to meditate but keep falling asleep as sleep is crap averaging maybe 5 hours plus a daytime nap. Have trimmed high GI carbs and trying to get 30% of calories from fat 30% protein and 40% of calories from lower GI carbs. Eating more fat is great as it's so satisfying and delicious. Will see how cholesterol is tracking. .Starting to gain a better sense of wellbeing but am surprised it is taking so long - have read a few SD posts on that which is v helpful to make me more patient. .
I'm still going. Finding the third week quite hard. I got through my birthday meal though. 
I started my serious sober journey NYD 2015 - it all went very well for a month and a half and then in February I had a drink. Spent about four months drunk after that ended up falling down the stairs and breaking some ribs having to have an ECG because my heart was hurting and my left arm was going numb and generally becoming a fucking mess. Took until June before I found SD...So. ..Don't have a drink in February would be my advice to those of you rocking the New Year's Startpoints. 
I quit on January 2. I wasn't really planning on it; I knew I had to stop sooner than later if I didn't want to die or end up rock bottom but I kept putting it off and never made a resolute or conscious decision to stop on that day. New Year's day I started drinking in the afternoon (which I never usually did - only on special occasions). I had mimosas (a whole bottle of bubbly) then graduated to cider beer wine gin bailey's...whatever I could find in the house. Once I started I made a decision suddenly to just drink the house dry and then that would be it. So iI drank the house dry and then I haven't drank again since...I think it helped me a lot that I didn't make it a big deal or create a huge build up to my last day drunk. I had been lurking on here for a couple weeks prior and for the previous 18 months kept telling myself and other that I had to stop but with little effort on my part and never making it longer than 4 days without caving the wine demons...I found out the next day that a close friend of mine had also quit drinking on December 31. Total serendipity. She had read Allan Carr's Stop Drinking Now which on her suggestion I bought read and loved. I told her about this subreddit and she joined and loves. ..I feel great these days. I'm very happy that I stopped killing myself. It's amazing to have woken up 22 days in row without a hangover. 22 days without drowning myself in poison to escape forget numb disappear. While I still have lots of issues to work on (booze just bandaged as I'm sure it did for many of you too) I'm taking it one day at a time being kind to myself (and others) and seeing this as a journey not a race. The physical cravings are gone. The psychological/emotional ones are still lurking but the Allan Carr method **REALLY** helped me in overcoming the brainwashing and illusions that booze helps us or tastes good or has **ANY** positive effects on us...These days mainly I'm exhausted. I'm tired sleep too much and my energy is low but that's okay. My body is healing and it needs time. I'm giving it the TLC it deserves and needs. ..My biggest worry is coming up in a couple months. I currently work in the service industry but have been off since the end of January with a broken leg. I became sober during my time away from the bar/restaurant scene. The day will come when I have to go back unless I find another job (God-willing) but I've been applying and interviewing for jobs in my area since I finished grad school in 2014 and no luck. I don't want to stay in the industry but while I'm waiting for something legit to come through that's what I have. And I work alone at the bar. And drinking is allowed by the owner. I would get shitfaced every shift. I'm terrified about how returning to that environment will affect my sobriety. It's a terrible place for a recovering alcoholic to work in - surrounded by alcohol with no supervision or deterrent to not jump in. Anyways I have another 5-6 weeks off at least and I'm working on developing a plan to deal with that reality.
I'm a 2014 New Years baby so two years for me! And counting :)
I quit 1/1/16 hardest and longest month ever! Still really want to drink but i wont. Went to a family party yesterday everyone drinking noone cared that I wasnt. I dont want to quit FOREVER! I am determined to make it through January anyway.
[deleted]
My "party" extended a couple of days into 2016 so I'm a bit behind....I had such a bad bender that week that I am still very committed to not drinking. I had a couple of "what the hell?" moments recently but just focused on how sad and in pain I was on Jan. 3 and all the years prior -- and how I don't ever want that again....Feeling good otherwise. It's definitely an uphill struggle dealing with emotions and feelings I haven't had in years. But I'm less tired and more clear-headed. Day by day...I'm also amazed at how much time and money I have. For years I thought it was just because I was getting older (perceiving time differently) and that I didn't make enough money. Hah!
Dec 27 was my first day sober. Much easier this time so far but I am trying to stay humble. I've been warned that being overly confident can result in a relapse. 
Day 27 for me decided to stop drinking before New Years on December 28th. Haven't gone this long since I started drinking 6 or 7 years ago...I tried quitting last New Years and only made it 3 weeks then pretty much drank all throughout 2015. So much money and time wasted. So much anxiety and loneliness...Something is different this time I can feel it. I haven't even had any urges or cravings. I also have someone very close to me who had to stop so I'm not only doing it for myself.
I quit caffeine and alcohol at the same time.  Thought I was going to be a mess.  The first week I was so at peace with everything and my body felt relaxed and happy.  The third week was the toughest because I was agitated and stressed more than usual.  I have been to happy hour with friends many times and no cravings at all.  I usually either drink water or soda water with a splash of pineapple juice.  Its much more refreshing.
I started on January 2 and was doing really well but had a pretty big slip on the 17. I've come back with renewed vigour and new supports and plans. It's pretty tough and I'm slowly trying to restructure my life but it does feel somewhat better most of the time. Here's to commitment!
I'm just massively tired all the time. Thought I'd have more energy. But yep quit NYE....
So many NYE sober babes! I am one of them too. Doing well--getting sick and tired of the people in my life talking about how great craft beer is and I am annoyed when people want to socialize by going to a bar. But I am still strong in my commitment and have been slowly getting my friends to do other types of activities with me like thrift store shopping coffee and exercise classes. 
I did. Drank my last beer around 3am New Years Day and haven't had one since. I've been tempted two or three times but quenched it with soda and food. I used booze mostly to help my stage fright but now I've learned to embrace it and go with the flow. I can sing sober in front of people now and also love having control of my voice. Let us keep going and cheer on others who follow.
Still here! I feel fantastic but I honestly think that I would have struggled more if I hadn't prepared myself the way I did. This isn't my first dance with sobriety - each time I attempted before while I didn't achieve the long-lasting success I had hoped for (9 months being the longest) I learned so much. This time around I have all those learnings in my pocket. I also have this amazing community which I am so thankful for. My last drink New Years Eve 2015 was ceremonial - but not because it was New Years Eve but because it was my way of saying goodbye. Isn't that funny? Saying goodbye to drinking by drinking? But I did and I wasn't sad about it or scared because I felt the need to change and the excitement about my future. Each day I use an app to track my mood and on those days where I'm not great I take a moment to think about *why* I'm not feeling great. Feeling raw unaltered feelings again takes time to get used to so I try and really understand them. I also have a calendar (really just a series of numbers on cardboard paper taped to my wall lol) that I cross off each day. I started with 90 days because I know it takes 90 days to develop a habit. I enjoy the ritual of crossing off each day as I go. And tonight when I get to cross of 24 I'll think about how the day went and remind myself that even tho I am on a journey I am focused on one day at a time. 
Xmas eve- still here! 
Been sober from booze and drugs since the 1st of January. My family gave me an intervention as I was out of control. I have been really thinking about drinking lately. ..My brother who organised the intervention was supposed to do sober January with me but he didn't last a week. He told me this last night. It really pissed me off as he was telling me about how he was going for drinks. I felt kind of betrayed and have been wanting to drink. I haven't though and it's been getting more and more tough...My mind keeps saying that after this month I can go back to drinking but I really don't want to do that. It's been getting tough as I've been getting pent up and bored just hanging out at my place alone all the time. 
I started when you did (it will be 23 days sober this afternoon).  I am getting better at dealing with stress in ways other than drinking and this has made a huge difference.  Also my social life is getting better and a good friend has decided to cut back on drinking after seeing me sober. :)
I quit January 4th and I'm hanging in there ( I couldn't quit on a weekend ) Sleeping sucks though... At first I slept too much and now I can't sleep at all! Ahh! 
I went with Christmas Day because Christmas Eve was the last day I'd be pressured to drink. Still hanging in there. Shedding weight helped me keep it going for the first while. I have my moments of weakness still but I feel way better overall especially during the week. I still need to figure out some stuff to do on the weekends.
I have never had a New Year's resolution in my life.  All I know is that I woke up naked in my own bed on 1/1/16 with no idea as to how I got there.  I had spent most of NYE with a friend and had packed a bag to stay at his house.  I was convinced that once my head stopped spinning and the nausea went away I'd have to get an  ber ride back to get my car.  Little did I know I had left a path of destruction and embarrassment nearly lost a 9 year friendship and drove my car home with no recollection of any of it.  When I got downstairs to my car I realized that half of my clothes were still in the there from the night before.  I'm not sure why but that means I walked up to my apartment half naked.  I had to have my friends tell me what I did the night before and I was devastatingly embarrassed beyond belief.  .I'm on day 24 of living sober.  I have been to an AA meeting everyday this month.  This should have happened years ago but it didn't.  So many stories like the one I just described have transpired over many years.  They keep getting worse each time.  I thought my blackout from Halloween last year was the worst.  As it turns out the one that happened 3 months later was my rock bottom.  Thankfully I didn't end up killing anyone or myself in this nightmarish scenario.  I just know that this last one scared me bad!  It scared me enough to make the change.  If I relapse I am going to lose friendships and probably end up in jail or dead.  .Good luck to all of you who are going through this.  We will get through it.  Knowing that other people are going through this is helping me so much.  Take care everyone!
Hey girl I'm a big fan of your posts always inspiring NYE sober baby here too . I'm feeling good getting stronger day to day with help from all the great people here at SD and my family . I was so lucky never having withdrawals but I still get urges sometimes like a hot flash  but I work through it by coming here or calling  family or husband at work  thanks for getting us together here in your post I hope we can all stay strong in this fight!!! Btw  my husband turned me on to the SD and I can't thank him enough. It's always great to see you here
Yup started NYD and still sober and dedicated to stop drinking.  I was amazed by all the detox issues this time around.  Never happened before.  I'm happy to say I'm doing well and I thank SD for being here.  I found it on Day 4 when I happened on the WAPO article.  That changed my life.
Hi there RHR. I'm still here. Dec. 28 was my first sober day - I'll hit 30 days on Wednesday. I didn't want to wait for New Year's because I don't trust myself with New Year's resolutions after having failed at them so many times. So somehow for me starting *before* New Year's felt more serious and real. Plus I knew I was going to be alone and isolated for New Year's (I was house- and pet-sitting out in the country with snow too deep to make going out for New Year's a safe proposition) so it was just going to be me on the couch with a bottle of wine anyway. And I didn't feel like I would be missing out on much by giving that up. I've probably had enough solo bottle-and-couch nights to last the rest of my life honestly...I've been doing well - this forum has been my main support but I've also started going to AA meetings and I'm liking them. I don't have a home group or a sponsor yet though. I found a therapist and we're having our second meeting next week. I'm feeling a ton better both physically and mentally which almost worries me - actually it does worry me because I'm afraid of feeling betrayed and going back to drinking once the euphoria leaves me (which it will at some point right?). AA worries me too because the people are so nice and I have such a feeling of belonging (except for the whole God thing) that the whole thing seems too good to be true. I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop. I don't feel like I can just relax into the group and trust them surely there must be hidden dysfunction or petty infighting here that I'm not seeing. I grew up in some pretty dysfunctional churches as a child and teenager and I have an identity as "not a joiner."  Although now I'm in choir and AA and I see the same people in yoga all the time. Almost in spite of myself I'm starting to venture out of my loneliness. It feels amazing...I wasn't ready to admit that I'm an alcoholic when I started this and I was only going to not-drink for 30 days. But now that I've almost done my 30 days I know I can't drink again anytime soon (probably ever but I'm not able to think that far ahead right now). Not drinking has turned out to be the missing piece to my mental health and motivation and I WISH I'd known it sooner. I have depression I'm medicated for it. Alcohol is poison to my brain chemistry it makes the depression SO MUCH worse. If I weren't an alcoholic I could have cut back for my own mental health once I realized this and I could have become a person who just drinks one or two drinks a few times a month or less. But I can't cut back like that - I've tried for years and I've failed. I can drink habitually and obsessively or I can stop. I'm still feeling super-sorry for myself about this; it feels like most people I know can drink without problems and I'm left out in the cold looking at the things I used to love. But then I started thinking about all the things I *can* consume - I don't have celiac disease so I can eat gluten - pizza and pasta and bread oh my. I'm not allergic to dairy so I can have ice cream. I'm not allergic to nuts or shellfish or eggs or really much of anything. But apparently I'm allergic to alcohol. When you put it that way it doesn't sound so bad...I've been thinking a lot lately about the difference between "simple" and "easy." In the last week I've finally admitted that I'm an alcoholic and my best friend has (finally) been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. In a way this is a huge relief for both of us - we now know what's wrong with us. And we know how to fix it and we both WANT to fix it. She needs to take her medication and to limit her drinking to no more than 2 drinks at a time *at most*. And I need to simply not drink. This is simple. But it's not easy...I'm so glad I already started on this not-drinking adventure because now I can avoid being a bad influence while my friend tries to moderate - a lot of our friendship used to consist of drinking together but we've already managed to keep the friendship intact while I've been abstaining for the last 27 days (she's been hugely supportive). And if it turns out she can't moderate then I can be part of her support network while she quits too. I never really thought about the effect that my sobriety could have on someone else but of course it has ripples. When I was drinking every day and every night I never thought that my habits affected anyone else because I'm single with no kids. But now that I'm not drinking I'm becoming part of a community and also realizing that I've been part of a community all along - and what I do the choices I make for good and bad those things affect others. I'd rather be a good example than a horrible warning. :-)
I quit before new years. I had two weeks off and drank through most of it then fantasized about killing myself. I stopped drinking and those thoughts went away. I relapsed a week ago after some bad news about my mom's cancer but got back up again. I feel fantastic. Mainly I don't feel so depressed. I forgot how much alcohol affects my thinking. It puts me in a dark dark place.
