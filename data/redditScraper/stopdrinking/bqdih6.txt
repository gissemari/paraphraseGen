Hi there. I'm six months sober tomorrow (woop woop!) and beginning to veer (slightly) off the AA path. I'm looking for some non-religious emotional support and empathy. ..To make an insanely long story less long (still kind of long though forgive me) I'm 30 was hospitalized for fucking up my liver and wasn't expected to live past 90 days (MELD score of 38). Since my near-death experience I've lived with my parents (away from my husband who stopped drinking too once I scared the shit out of him) relearned how to walk went to rehab for a month lost 55lbs went to intensive outpatient therapy for another month and a half did the "90 in 90" AA thing and moved back home. ..Things I've learned that have proven to be true for me so far:.1.) My sickness loves isolation and healing from a crippling addiction is often best done consistently in a group .2.) "I'm not hurting anyone" is a bullshit lie I told myself to keep drinking eventually leading to me hurting and scaring everyone who loves me.  2a.) I am loved .3.) A good AA group will not judge me if I don't believe in a traditional Judeo-Christian higher power.4.) I drank to excess because injuring myself in that way felt like I had control over something .5.) Chocolate is the shit ..Things I've learned that have proven to be FALSE for me so far:.1.) I WILL experience cravings (I had minor auditory triggers when I first moved home- hearing a soda can hit the table reminded me of beer- but they seem to have gone and it never made me feel like drinking because I DO NOT want to go back to how I felt when I was drinking) .2.) My husband DOES NOT love me because if he did he wouldn't have "let it" get this bad (I had a family member tell me this so furiously that I let it get to me for longer than I should have) .3.) Moving back home into my old environment WILL be really difficult (I've only been home for a few weeks but it's honestly just really lovely to be back with supportive and sober friends and my supportive and sober husband)..Things I'm worried about: .1.) I stopped going to AA every day because the meetings around here are very different. I'm going to keep trying but the Meeting Guide app isn't up to date for my area and just last week I showed up at three different meetings that were all nonexistent. When I called the main office for our area I basically got shrugged off with a "well they should be there..." .2.) My sponsor lives out-of-state (where I did rehab and all that) and I'm not making a huge effort to keep in contact with her right now. I did the "action steps" with her (1-9). I liked her well enough but she was basically a stranger who was recommended to me and I didn't connect with her on any meaningful level. Finding someone willing to adapt to my atheistic worldview was hard enough with my (apparently progressive) out of state home group and it seems like around here (small town vibes) there are a lot of old grumpy dudes who like to say "AA IS THE ONLY WAY ANYTHING SIMILAR TO AA IS NOT AA AND WILL KILL YOU Y'ALL NEED JESUS" (verbatim) which really puts me off...I've heard people getting "comfortable" in their sobriety and start "slacking"- going to meetings less not getting a sponsor not swallowing every word of the BB and it leads to their relapse. For me relapse is a life or death thing not figuratively and not by some external force like a car crash. Every single doc I had said if I pick up again I might as well go on a bon voyage cruise because I am not coming back. I feel amazing my creativity empathy even motivation have infiltrated my life again. I don't have cravings. Rediscovering life sober is honestly exhilarating. I think about where I was every day. I treat every boozeless day as a victory. New high scores...I guess what I'm getting at is 12 step recovery has done wonders for me and I'm feeling... I don't know guilty about easing up? Fearful? I went to my first SMART meeting and both my husband and I absolutely loved it but it's only once a week. AA has done me well but the mental games and conscious rephrasing I have to do to have it make sense to me has been off-putting from day one. (Mostly the religious stuff.) ..I would love to hear from anyone who has experience with AA who doesn't use it militantly and still stays sober. I'd love to hear from anyone who stayed sober gladly without AA. I'd also love encouragement from anyone willing to give it. (Needy much?)..And I know I'm celebrating a bit prematurely but can I get a HELL YEAH for SIX MONTHS?! (Or an "amen" if you must!) :)

I have a similar story. I went from 5 meetings a week to 3 now down to 1 that I'm pretty regular with. I try to spend a few hours a week plugging in here on SD do some service work and that usually works for me. ..The good part about AA is that you make the program work for you. It doesn't have to be perfect. I should do more but am comfortable where I am now. ..It has to work for you.
