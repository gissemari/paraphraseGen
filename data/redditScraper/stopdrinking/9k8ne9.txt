I feel like mess like i deserve for relapsing 3 days ago. But my motivation has risen and now became a bit more tactical. Please dont let me drink tonight no matter what it takes. If i make it through today thats a day more than last try.  My thoughts combined with panic are like a storm i cant see in. But just for today..IWNDWYT
