So I see a lot of posts on here about people slipping up/relapsing/resetting their badges and the shame and disappointment that comes with it. ..I was about 7 days sober and I slipped up. Grabbed a 4 pack of my favourite Jack & Coke and drank that across the night (tame compared to the half a bottle I was doing per night). Even as I was drinking it I felt like absolute shit and really disappointed in myself. The self-loathing the next morning was even worse. I was doing so well and so proud of myself than I let the stress of the day get the better of me...But you know what? I'm not going to get too down on myself. The way I look at it is that is that in the past 10 days I have only drank once. This is a huge improvement from the last couple of years where I was drinking every.single.day. I look at that as a win and as real improvement. I'm even more determined now to stick at it...Yeh the badge may be reset and yeh I slipped up - but already the improvement in behaviour is there. ..I guess my point is - don't be so hard on yourself we all mess up every now and then. At least you are trying and working at it which is a lot better than not trying at all. Dust yourself off and get back to it :)..I will not drink you all today...

Big win.  Good you came back.  I too have reset the badge.  It's a process.  Keep on keeping on!  I won't drink with you today.
Yep my slip was difficult but left me with a renewed appreciation for the good choices I had been making. 2-3 beers one night out of the past 101 is a hell of a lot better than where I was at even if my badge says 58. So glad you came right back! Proud of you 
You *are* still on track.  Good job limiting your drinking instead of going on a serious binge (as I probably would have done).  And limiting the self-loathing is much more productive than wallowing in it.
