Started today out in a decent mood ... today is day 5. Decided I was not going to drink .. then I did my taxes and started thinking about my other finances. It's a mess that will take time to straighten out...That made me want to drink ... put my boots and coat on but then thought about the added anxiety ill have tomorrow and the fact i really don't need to go spend money on beer with finances like this...However ... this addiction is insane right this moment i'm sitting here ... next moment I could be headed for the door again ...
