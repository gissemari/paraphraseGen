Welp once again I'm in that terrible spot where I literally cannot control my urge to drink and do hard drugs to the point where I'm afraid to go out. I can stay home and not drink but I get really depressed. Started out moderating some months back went OK for a while. Started slipping a bit before Mardi Gras then "cut loose" completely for Mardi Gras. Still haven't stopped the drugs / booze and feel like a shell of a person today. Last night was fucked and involved a really intense combo of fast drugs that I'm lucky didn't throw me in the hospital. There's been twice recently I felt like my heart was going to explode. I've been going through this vicious cycle for years yet I live in a city where it's totally accepted and normal among huge swaths of the people who live here. I watch my friends wither and die around me. And it's totally accepted as OK. I'm the outcast for trying to stay sober. My girlfriend is amazing and is of course pissed at me but has no understanding or concept of addiction and is normalizing what I'm doing in her own way. Which is very damaging cause I need her badly right now. But I know she has no understanding of how to help me. But I know I can talk to y'all on here. Drinking a case of beer and doing shit loads of sketchy street drugs until the early morning is not what normal people do. Doing that shit multiple times a week is not normal not remembering half of what I did in the past few weeks / month whatever I can't quite remember is not normal.  I have had windows of a few days here and there sober and I'm using that to normalize my problem. I really need people to reaffirm to me right now that this pattern is fucked and not normal please. Thanks

This pattern is fucked and not normal! Have you tried getting support from a therapist and/or a group like NA/AA? Being surrounded by people who drink heavily and use and normalizing it is not a great situation to be in obviously. Wishing you the best. I am not drinking (or using drugs) today will you join me?
Trust me there is a way out and a really big pool of us "new normal" folks. I came up in San Francisco in the late 90's "rave" and party scene. My Thursday nights and my Sunday afternoons were one and the same. I kicked my meth thing long before I tackled booze (actually didn't drink back then at all) and I remember the first time I was driving to a race at 5:30 am on a Sunday and saw the line outside the End Up a club that opened at 6 am and stayed open until 4 am. I was like "oh hey that was me!" I randomly caught eyes with someone and was thinking "there is a life on the other side and it's pretty great!"
