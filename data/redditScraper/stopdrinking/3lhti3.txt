So last night I finally poured the rest of my alcohol down the kitchen sink.  I can't really say why I held onto it this long.  I've seen the posts of people throwing it out on the first night but I didn't.  Every time I thought about getting rid of it this anxious feeling would come over me and I would chicken out.  Well last night it finally dawned on me that I was keeping an escape hatch available in case things got really bad.  Thus the anxious feeling every time I thought about getting rid of it.  I decided at that moment that I was being stupid.  Why should I make it easy for me to relapse?  It just seemed so counter intuitive.  So down the drain it went.  And you know what?  I feel better today knowing there is no alcohol in my house.  This post may seem stupid to some people but I just wanted to share my little victory.

Major victory and not stupid at all. Well done you! :)
No way not stupid.  Good for you!
Nice one! On at least two occasions in the early weeks I had made the decision to drink again. Thankfully I managed to change my mind again but I was on a knife edge. You've got rid of the knives that buys in valuable time! 
As a person who lives literally across the street from a liquor store and struggles I used to feel having it in the house was no big deal since I could walk across the street and get it anyhow...That walk across the street has stopped me a few times thanks to the extra few seconds to think about the consequences. Glad you cleared house!
I'd say that's a pretty huge thing. Great job!
Congratulations! What a major victory! It sounds like you are preparing for your future sobriety in a really powerful way.
