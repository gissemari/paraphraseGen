Hi everyone..I know this might sound a bit frivolous but I see it as something of a personal milestone. I've tried to quit drinking multiple times and I've only ever relapsed when sober for longer than 2 months by deluding myself: "hey everyone does it look at all these beautiful television people drinking 1-2 beers I'm a guy's guy" - never from a craving or impulse. I've found that the times I've successfully quit for long periods I've always known that "this is the one"...However on all other "successful" attempts for longer than 2-3 months I've been plagued with weekly relapse dreams where I can wake up semi-sweating because I think I've just drank 8 beers or consumed cocaine by myself in my squalid flat or furiously masturbated (I normally always start nofap when going sober)...**Last night in my dream** I was sat - alone in my bedroom - with a 6-pack of beer 2 bags of cocaine and pornography on my computer screen and I remember thinking "what the hell am I doing" and getting rid of everything before I could start...Again might sound stupid but I woke up in such a fantastic mood that I was laughing about it. I'm hoping and praying that this is some kind of serious psychological turning point for me and was wondering if anyone has had similar experiences...Much love IWNDWYT.

I understand the victory well done! I've had drinking dreams for the past three nights in a row and haven't been able to restrain myself. I do think that certain dream-states prevent you from challenging the lizard brained behaviour though so I try not to read too much into it in my own case.
