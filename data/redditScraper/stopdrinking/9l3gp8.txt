I use to drink a lot. Almost daily 5-6 times a week. Ive done some hurtful regrettable things to myself and others. I've lost all friends and most family sees me as a screwup because of my drinking. I've hit rock bottom more than once and I have a hundred little scars outside and a million big scars inside that will only heal when I give up this last crutch I've carried with me since age 16. I would drink for everything in life for sad and happy moments vacations and parties and even to bear going to work. I would drink AT work after work and all weekend long. Since last year I've toned it down to 3-4 times a week drinking but I would get obliterated to the point of blacking out and i have been to jail and am on probation for regrettable things I have done while drunk. Although since September I've cut down to only 2 times a week  I need to just take a fricking break foreal this time. I attempted to stay sober the last two weeks and I failed terribly. I drank two bottles of wine last weekend and the weekend before that. I'm tired of losing consciousness of making a complete fool of myself. I don't want to be this person anymore. my stomach hurts at all hours weird pains in my sides too. I know my liver cries for help and my skin breaks out after a binge. I can't afford to ruin myself any longer I just can't. I'm posting here today because Today and this weekend I plan to be sober for  a long while.  I owe it to myself. I'm going to a concert tonight and I've had thoughts about drinking but I'm going to post here when I have urges I don't know really how to have fun at concerts without drinking as I've never been sober for one.... I think this challenge might be fun to actually spend time with sober me. I'm excited to succeed and the person I'm going with has decided to aid me in my struggle by staying sober too :) I hope they don't break m but if they do I have to stay strong and remember it's MY CHOICE and what's right for me to say no!

Hell yeah if you can quit smoking then you can do alcohol!
