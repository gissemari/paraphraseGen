I've been struggling today again it's been snowing all day kids have been off from school and I've been working from home. ..I made my excuse to go to the shop fully intending to grab a bottle of vodka or scotch. But I didn't I kept telling myself 'What does it matter if you don't drink today'? Being sober for one more day won't kill me. So I bought and  ate a bag of haribo a bag of babybel and a packet of salami and downed a bottle of apple &amp; mango juice. ..The junk food was satisfying...Continued working upstairs when the Mrs' mate pops round to get her hair done brandishing a bottle of VK Blue &amp; a bottle of ros . I'm sat here now watching them drink and GOD do I want one! I've distracted myself so far with playing Dishonoured shovelling snow from my front steps checking on my neighbour smoking and now Reddit. But fuck I want that wine. If it's still here when the Mrs' mate leaves I'm gonna have to tip it down the sink can't trust myself..Sorry for the rambling as I said I'm just trying to take my mind off it...It's going to take a big effort today but IWNDWYT!

I don't have alcohol in the house for the simple reason that I would drink it so I'm with you with the tipping down the sink. It does get easier (not easy unfortunately) and haribo definitely helps! Keep going you can do it
Are you playing the original Dishonored?  It's one of my favorite games of all time.  I really loved the DLC for it too...I just finished up the sequel last week and am debating on whether to get Death of the Outsider next or Prey (another game from the same studio released in 2017 that is supposed to be awesome).
