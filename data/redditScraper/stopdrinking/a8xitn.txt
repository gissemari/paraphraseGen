The top post at the moment is triggering me pretty hard especially because I'm in a similar situation to the brother who passed away. Like...that could be me. This last relapse could have ended that way. I'm grateful to still be fighting the fight even tho its. so. fucking. hard. I'm grateful to everyone who responded to my last post I have been setting up for a stronger sobriety the whole day preparing myself. One step at a time. IWNDWYT.

If you're finding it seriously hard have you considered a support group like AA or SMART? That may help. My first two years of trying to were sooo dark it was awful before I found AA. And then it was still awful for a while but kept getting a bit better each day until life actually became really lovely.
