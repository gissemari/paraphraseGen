My mom sent me a newspaper clipping about this site and I'm looking for help. I've been struggling to stop drinking for about 3 years now. I first realized I had a problem in 1999. I stopped drinking for 12 years then convinced myself (well that was sure easy!) that I could drink normally again. I drank heavily but with time constraints for 2 years. Then I got out of control. Since then I've been trying to quit not very successfully. Last December I almost overdosed on alcohol. My body does not tolerate alcohol at all anymore but I continue to crave it daily esp in the early evening. One of the worst aspects of my cravings is the total illogic. I get the initial buzz but soon I feel sick. And I feel yucky much longer than the buzz lasts. I'll have withdrawal symptoms after only one drink and it matters not what form the alcohol comes in - beer wine vodka... ..I drank yesterday while at my son's home. I was there to celebrate his college graduation a truly major accomplishment. He had an open bottle of tequila that I snuck drinks from. My son knows that I have a problem with drinking but because he's a normal drinker he does not appreciate how severe my lack of discipline is how if available I'd drink mouthwash containing alcohol. And I drank knowing how distressed he would be if he knew on one of the most memorable days of his life. I risked his memories of the day just for a swig. ..I don't know how to stop esp when the cravings hit so hard. I've tried 12-step stuff and it's not for me. I'd really appreciate hearing from others who have experience successfully dealing with cravings esp ones that seem to have a biorhythm flavor to them.

What's different between the 12 yr sobriety mark to now? From your description that dryspell certainly changed body's physiological response at least somewhat but the tools and steps you used then...can they apply today?
Why is the 12-step stuff not for you? Have you tried different groups etc. ? It can't hurt! Sometimes finding the right people and hearing the right things helps. If you quit for 12 years before you should be able to do it again!! If the actual physical aspect of the addiction is a problem which it sounds like it is you need to talk to a doctor/therapy/get medical help in some form or another...But as we all know it's starts with not drinking ***today***. I will join you.
Alcoholism is progressive and it gets worse over time as you have witnessed. Recovery takes many forms but most folks agree that it begins with recognizing that you have a problem and commences from there by taking some form of action. Many of those initial actions can be found on the FAQ tab for this sub. ..The action I take every day is to recognize that I have a problem: I'm an alcoholic. It's a permanent situation and since I've proven over and over that moderation isn't something I can do the only treatment is abstinence. So I commit to abstaining from drinking (and other stuff) every day for one day. I can't be sober tomorrow but I can not drink today...I invite you to not drink with me today...I turns out that the thing that really helps most of us is... us. I was unable to stop on my own but when I engaged with a supportive community I succeeded. For some that means AA or other groups devoted to recovery. For others it's SD. For me it's both because I need all the help I can get! Welcome!
Try SMART Recovery www.smartrecovery.org. What I like about SMART is that for those who are in the early phases of quitting the program provides very practical specific advice on dealing with cravings. Urge logs. Action plans. Urge surfing. And at meetings tools like these are discussed and you hear the experiences of others who are also using them...SMART is secular and not a 12 step program. I think you will like it.

Hello friend.  You quit for 12 years.  Maybe the psychological weight of having completed something for that long is stunting your ability to feel good about shorter terms of quitting.  You can't do 12 years all at once so you need a better way to get back to one day week month.  I don't know what your solution is but sometimes knowing what your problem is is half the battle.  Good luck.
