I have been stressed lately after I decided to move sell my house and begin living at my dead fathers cabin in the mountains nearly 10 hours away. Multiple trips back and forth moving stuff have left me exhausted...I began drinking again beers here and there then last week had a full on relapse. My mother came this weekend to help with a yard sale and while I took the last of it to the good will I stopped for what I hope is my last beer for good. ..We went to dinner afterward where I admitted this relapse to her. Being a recovering alcoholic herself with many many years of sobriety she was very frank about how normal this was and we discussed in depth how real this problem is for our family. She of course offered her support and I explained how I hoped moving out of the college drinking town I currently live in should help me with my triggers. I plan to go to some meetings when I move into my new town...It felt good to be honest with her and myself. ..I have more work and stress ahead of me in the last couple of weeks before I list my house but right at the top of my todo list I wrote - Do Not Drink. I mean to commit to that. IWNDWYT

Hey you have to start somewhere right? ..I think acknowledging what triggers you and taking a strategic approach is very wise of you. Being upfront and honest with someone helps tremendously as well. ..The thing I'm learning is whether or not you choose to acknowledge it life is going to be stressful. Alcohol is never the answer or solution. Facing challenges head on is the way to go. ..Proud of you!
