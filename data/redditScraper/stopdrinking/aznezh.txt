So I had some liver function tests come back abnormal and was advised to stop drinking completely while we figure out exactly what's going on. My enzymes were slightly elevated and had a couple other tests come back abnormal..Today is my 16th day without a beer and I'm struggling. Prior to 16 days ago I was mostly a weekend drinker few beers with dinner kind of guy. I just love beer. I didn't drink every night and I didn't drink till I was black out. ..Today I went for lunch with my wife and just really started craving a beer and now it's like an itch I can't scratch. I don't want to stop drinking but I may have to stop drinking. If I do - how do I get over this hump? Does it ever get easier?

It does. Human body can get used to almost everything as well it can stop craving almost everything...It just needs time. And in alcohol the time depends from person to person. You will see...I hope your tests will come back better and you will feel great. IWNDWYT 
The only way it gets easier is if you truly want to stop. Otherwise there will be resentment about the fact you can't drink and that is a hard thing to resist in perpetuity. FWIW I also had slightly elevated liver enzymes. Just got retested after 3 weeks of no drinking and they came back down into the middle of the normal range. Hope everything works out for you!
