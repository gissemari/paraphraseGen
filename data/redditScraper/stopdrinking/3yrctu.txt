Hey guys!!! Happy Wednesday!! WuW is where we calibrate our week check in and see how our SD buds are doing and support each other in our sobriety.  Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type with us!..**Triumph:** The longer I'm sober the more my perspectives shift.  I'm starting to notice some more significant changes in the way I think and behave.  I'm less likely to throw pity parties for myself.  I don't feel like I am missing out on things anymore.  Even when I am stressed and down I'm able to identify reasons why I'm grateful all the positive things I am lucky to have in my life.  I feel more excited for future possibilities rather than just feeling like I am perpetually waiting out the present.  ..**Struggle:**  I want to use this space to vent.  I just want to word-vomit everything that is bugging me at this moment.  Just to get out and be able to let it go for the next twenty-four hours.  My car wouldn't start Tues morning.  My job situation seems like it will get worse before it gets better.  I've been confronting a lot of insecurities about myself that manifest as a lack of motivation and jealousy.  I've felt like isolating myself a lot lately... even just getting online and posting on reddit feels like a chore.  And my cat who occasionally poops on the floor is pooping there more than occasionally. ..**General Chat:** This past year I've been trying to be less ritualistic.  Since I was a small child I've been really ritualistic about dates and numbers and my habits so New Years Eve has always been something I loved but anxiously so. I would make resolutions on New Years but I would also be really ritualistic about how many (12 for each month or 10 because it seemed like a good number).  I had to do everything perfectly or else I had to quit and/or start over.  I would be ritualistic about my birthday and other dates too.  More and more I'm consciously making an effort not to be ritualistic. I'm not making resolutions because I always intend to have something that I am working on.  The amount of time it takes me to get there or when I start is arbitrary.
