Hi first post here..I've been struggling with long term sobriety for 9 years. I'm 27 years old and currently have just under 3 months..I had been planning to drink for about 12 hours. I came home to my girlfriend and I couldn't sleep because I was going to drink this morning. My girlfriend got up at 330 am to work at Starbucks until 715. I ended up getting up with her. I stay at her place all the time but I packed my pillow pajamas my meds my work shirt for the next day and my glasses/contacts. I planned on leaving Starbucks to go to my house after buying a big bottle of wine. Instead she asked that I come back to her place to cuddle before she went to work at her other job. So I agreed and then afterwards slept til noon. I haven't drank and I still want to..but I'm not going to..I want a year of sobriety. I want to not think about drinking. I don't want to put alcohol before everything else. I don't want to destroy what I love. I don't want my girlfriend to blame herself and cry because I know she would. That's all I have to say.
