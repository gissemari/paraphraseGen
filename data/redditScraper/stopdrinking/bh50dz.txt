Hey there..i have been lurking on here for a while now but i feel like i need to share something. currently i'm on day 11 of my sobriety and i am feeling good. I sleep good again and with good i mean i fall asleep easier i don't wake up as much in the middle of the night and i feel well rested in the morning for me that means a lot...I am feeling more down to earth maybe picking up meditation has something to do with that as well but i'm feeling positive signals...I have met some old friends again and i don't mean old drinking buddies but friends who's value i ignored when i was drinking i told them about my problems and they are very supportive one of them gave me a camera with some lenses and is learning me some stuff about photography what i like a lot i'm almost out daily to take pictures of stuff i like mostly nature...Also i'm learning to know a lot of new people or people i did know before in AA meetings i go to 3 meetings a week currently and i find that it helps a lot...Al tough i have to say that it hasn't been that easy all the time after my first detox in the hospital i came out of the hospital and went straight to drinking again that is when i decided to join AA first week of that went well but then i relapsed then i did not go for a week i did isolate myself and i think that was the reason why i relapsed. Then someone of AA came over and talked to me and i felt good in some way i sold my car because i was having problems with it financially but also i am about to lose my driving license so no point in keeping it oh man did that feel good selling that car after i sold my car i went out into the nature about 50 meters from my door that's where i met one of my first friends we talked for a bit told him about my problems and we made plans so i can go help him in his garden he has cancer and is on treatment for it so he can't do much but i offered to do some work for him and he appreciated that. ..I got a camera back in October from someone i met in the woods over here but never did much with it so 2 days after i met my first friend i decided to go and make a walk again but now with that camera. i have been gone for half a day i remember taking pictures of the sun rising behind some trees and when i reached that spot again by noon the sun was a lot higher and that feeling i had there was indescribable i was aware that the planets etc are spinning and that i enjoyed this walk so hard i cannot describe the feeling and 20 meters from that spot was the guy who i got the camera from taking pictures of various things...He was very glad to see me with that camera we talked we talked about my problems he is also very supportive i now see him almost every day around the same spot not all of my pictures were good so he gave me some basic information about the camera and how it works. and later on we captured a roebuck in the area mind you we were the very first to capture it despite the spot where we were is constantly flooded with photographers because there are a lot of birds over there but despite that i was the very first to capture it on image...after reflecting on all of that i have a feeling that meeting those friends capturing some great shots with my camera etc are positive signs i'm doing well...That is what i wanted to share thanks a lot for reading this.

You're doing GREAT!  It's awesome the things you can do when you're sober.  Much nicer than looking for the next drink.  ..Keep it up!   IWNDWYT
