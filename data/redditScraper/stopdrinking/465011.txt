I've been struggling a lot with the religious overtones in AA lately. It's not a problem believing in a higher power - I have never had a problem with that - it's that I am don't believe in "being saved" by that higher power.  ..Perhaps it's because it's February and a lot of the meetings are focused on the 2nd Step but it's really getting under my skin. ..I generally feel really good about my recovery and AA but lately I've been questioning "the program" a great deal.  I don't believe I'm in danger of "going out" but I am struggling to find things that are valuable in meetings right now. ..I'd love to hear suggestions but I'm not particularly open to "I didn't get the god stuff but I came around" or "it's not god it's spirituality" kind of suggestions that seem to be what I get when I talk to most people about this. You're welcome to post them just know that they aren't particularly helpful to me. ..Thanks in advance.

Yeah I just broke up with my sponsor today :(...I think I will still attend meetings though. But for now I'm not going to focus on working the steps. I too struggled with steps 2 and 3 because as an atheist I don't believe in a higher power that "saves" people that I pray to or that resolves my problems for me...My biggest issue is that AA tells you that anything can be your higher power: family friends the program - a doorknob.  But according to AA your higher power cannot be *you.*..I believe in a self-empowerment model of addiction recovery. I believe it is my job my responsibility and within my power - to redeem myself. I think that only by taking back the power that was stolen from me when I was very young can I truly recover and heal.  ..I started doing AA a few months ago only.  I have not come around; I am still atheist I still believe that self-empowerment is the key to *my* recovery and I have reasons for that.  As a survivor of child abuse my power was taken from me when I was very young and I was crushed by those with power - making me ever-skeptical of authority figures and a higher power sounds like one hell of an authority figure to me.  So for me to heal I need to empower myself and shy away from any dis-empowerment ideals that are reminiscent of the helplessness powerlessness and dependency that I felt as a child in a dangerous home...I was sober for over a year without AA.  I focused on professional therapy and I mostly isolated alot. ..I think I will still attend AA meetings for the fellowship and I am not currently in a hurry to get another sponsor after my recent break-up (which was amicable.) 
As an atheist what helped me was looking at the steps like this:.._______________________________________.Step 1: I'm in a mess and over my head...Step 2: Maybe I don't have all the answers so I'll ask for help...Step 3: Decide to pay attention to advice given...Step 4: Take an honest look at how I've been living my life...Step 5: Tell someone else about my unhealthy lifestyle and harm to others...Step 6: Decide to live a healthier kinder life...Step 7: Make specific changes toward that goal...Step 8: List everyone I have hurt...Step 9: Have the courage to tell them I'm sorry &amp; make amends except if doing so would cause harm...Step 10: Keep an eye on myself alert to old thinking and behaviors...Step 11: Be aware of the beauty in the world and people...Step 12: Pass on to others the kindness extended to me.._______________________________________
When I went through the second step  it boiled down to me coming to believe I could get better  specifically that the program and the people in it could help me get better.  That's it.  At the time I guess the program/fellowship was my higher power.  It has since evolved but nothing ever saved in an active sense. I couldn't get or stay sober by myself let alone be happy.  So I asked for help  and I followed somewhat poorly I might add   some of the many suggestions and I got sober  and then I got happy. I didn't do it on my own  I seemingly couldn't do it on my own  but  with some guidance I did it. 
I'm not sure that "saved" or "redeemed" are words that I would use. If you're referring to step 2 the term used by AA is "restored to sanity."..To my way of seeing things "sanity" means simply living in agreement with reality and insanity means living in opposition to reality. Step 2 doesn't say anything particularly religious: if you read the language closely it's more of a proof-of-concept step. It says "came to believe" (meaning over time) that "a power" (goes unnamed!) "could" (not will) restore us to sanity. In this context what the step is really talking about is changing your mind with the help of something outside yourself. Not sure if that makes a difference or not but that was how I approached this when I started working the steps.

For me it's less about what I think or believe and more about what I do..Gratitude is a spiritual act.Humility is a spiritual act..Acceptance is a spiritual act..Doing something kind for someone else is a spiritual act..Shutting up and acting right is a spiritual act..Love is a verb. To love is a spiritual act...I know next to nothing about god or HP or whatever but the more I act in accordance with those spiritual principles the less conflict discord and chaos I sew in my life. The more serene I am the happier.  And mostly and this is the main thing I don't drink..
I've been doing Refuge Recovery (groups are hard to find though unless you live in a metro area) and it's a perfect fit for this atheist. I never believed a higher power could "save" me either too much off the AA dogma rubbed me the wrong way (it is also VERY churchy in my area another major turn off). Lots of people on here also use SMART recovery. Good luck!
an approach that emphasizes "being saved" doesn't resonate with me either. I've tried articulating my sentiments with recoverees and wasn't pleased with some of the defensive and self serving responses. Your comment seems like an improvement over mine in that you stated ahead of time the kind of replies that wouldn't be helpful to you.
Are you in the Bible Belt of the u.s. By any chance?
The big book talks about a psychic change. I have definitely had one of those and continue to have one. I don't consider myself saved I consider myself changed via the twelve steps.
SMART Recovery. 
Haven't heard anyone talking about "being saved" recently but it does come up. I question the "program" every day. It's okay to question it. It's even okay to disagree with it and some days just loath it. You have my permission to do that :) - not every thing works for every one but what works for me is to stay open to ideas/principles that they express. Honesty humility integrity etc. those things keep me coming back. I am not perfect and don't really strive for it but I hope that by working towards those things in my daily life that I will be a better person for it... Some call that idea "faith" and others call it being a "fucking human being"... I call it being CDISM ;) just be /u/soberboots
Personally I love the second step. Step 1 was super evident in my life when I stopped drinking but I felt like "ok I'm screwed my life is out of control now what?" The first time I saw Step 2 it was just "these people have been sober awhile ok maybe someday I want think about drinking all the time anymore."..I recently finished going through the steps for a second time and have gone through step 2 with 3 sponsees in the last few months and its taken on a whole different flavor. Now when I think about insanity for me it means a lack of proportion in the ability to think straight regarding alcohol (paraphrased from the BB). Right now in this moment I know that drinking is not a good option for my life. So in that sense in this moment I feel my thinking is sound regarding alcohol. ..2 years ago I was getting loaded from the moment I woke up until the moment I fell asleep and I thought that was the only possible way of living. Something has come into my life and allowed for this fundamental change in my thinking to occur. I don't know whether that is AA a sponsor a new social group a new living situation the steps a higher power or some combination of all of those. I don't know of I've been saved but I know something changed and I didn't do it myself. ..As far as not feeling like you are getting anything valuable in meetings I totally get that. Maybe use this as an opportunity to see what you can bring to a meeting that might help someone else. Try to treat meetings as an opportunity to be of service. 
You likely have an internal locus of control. http://wilderdom.com/psychology/loc/LocusOfControlWhatIs.html..If you feel this is the case for you you may do better with SMART Recovery than AA. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10972457
