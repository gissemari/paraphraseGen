This week I invited an old drinking buddy and his girlfriend over to our house to eat some homemade pizza. Making homemade dough and pizza has become a hobby of mine since quitting drinking. Listening to some reggae on headphones and shoving my fists into some dough is pretty cathartic. ..At any rate he turned me down and gave me a rain check. He still drinks but has been a really supportive friend. He has known that my level of drinking was very much different from his drinking. ..Anyway last night I had a dream that him and I went out drinking. It started with one refreshing beer and then escalated into a full-blown whiskey-fueled binge. In the dream I woke up feeling horrible but my wife did not know I had relapsed. ..The horrible feeling that resonated most with me however was the shame not the hangover. In my dream I actually dealt with the guilt of having to either lie about my r/stopdrinking day counter or admit it and start at 0. ..At any rate **I DIDN'T RELAPSE!!** I awoke scared. I had to check that I had been sober overnight. Thankfully I knew that the dream was a fiction. **It was a good warning though.** It taught me what a relapse might feel like and reminded me that I want to avoid that. ..I'll take another 24 hours of sobriety please!..u/drunkwooky out!

The drinking dreams seem to serve the purpose of experiencing a relapse but keeping your badge;).They are common but I certainly haven't ever seen anyone say they had a drinking dream and it was wonderfullol..Most of them are horrified..It seems like a healthy sign..I had one drinking dream but in the dream I was telling myself "Hey you're finally having a drinking dream!".The more serious dream was my drugging dream where I had dropped some drugs was worried I wouldn't get high enough and started plotting where I could get more. THAT was dark..Congrats to you on 98 days and I am glad you didn't tarnish your badge;)
I actually did tarnish my badge and it was way worse than the drinking dreams I had - because it was real.
