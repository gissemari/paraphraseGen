The last 7 weeks has seen me detox during the week only to ruin it on the weekends (unless I've been in hospital which is a lot recently) I struggle so much to not pick up the bottle. Like most of us I guess...My wife and I have separated (temporarily thankfully) as she can't deal with my drinking anymore and it's an awful way for my kids to see me...A week ago I slashed my wrist in an attempt to end it all. It wasn't 100% due to depression but a lack of overall hope in improving my life...Even though the cut was deep it wasn't enough to end it as my wife had called the police pretty much as soon as I did it because I took a photo of the blade and told her what I was about to do...The police were here in 5 minutes and dressed the wound. Ambulance rocked up and took me to hospital...Alcohol sucks so bad I hate it and want to stop. I've just gotten a script for naltrexone so I hope that's going to work

I have volunteered a lot in suicide prevention. The four weeks after an attempt are a very crucial time; you went through a major trauma. Now more than ever be good to yourself. ..When I was in your position I got out of the hospital and felt reborn but not in a good way. I felt unable to deal with the regular business of living; it was as if I had to relearn how to live. I did but it took real effort to find joy. I remember those days now so so fondly. ..Please check in again. Let us know how you are doing. Take it literally moment at a time.
