In general I spend a bit too much energy regretting things in my past.  Missed opportunities things I've done that led to negative outcomes things I didn't do that maybe/probably could have led to positive outcomes etc...One of the worst is when I think about boozing.  I'm 39 years old now and in not bad shape physically/professionally etc. but I often get stuck in a loop thinking about how much better my life would be had I not done so many stupid things in my late 20's and basically all of my 30's.  That all of the pretty good things I have now could have been SO much better if I didn't spend so much of my time drunk or letting alcohol impact my life/decisions/actions...Anyone else struggle with this and have a good way of letting go of regret?  As mentioned it's a weakness I have in general but it seems to sting really hard when it comes to alcohol.

I've found meditation helps me let go of stuff.  I can't change what I did yesterday but I can decide what I do today kind of thing.
Thank you for your courage to post!  ..It's funny how my view of my past has changed in recovery. I had huge shame and guilt over some of the things that I did drunk. Blackouts hid much of it from me but I found out from others just how badly I  had behaved. I did it at work with friends alone it didn't matter...Looking back on all that now I realize that my past is one of my hugest assets. If I hadn't done all that crap I wouldn't be here where I am now. That would be a real loss for me in my opinion...Here are lists of top-voted stopdrinking posts on various topics and the last link is for immediate relapse prevention: ..[consequences](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=consequences&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[alcoholic](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=alcoholic&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[relapse](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=relapse&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[moderation](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=moderation&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[humility](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=humility&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[atheist](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=atheist&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[decision](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=decision&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[attitude](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=attitude&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[prison](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=prison&amp;restrict_sr=on)..More Help: [Steps_1_2_3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/477gm4/demystifying_the_steps_simply_a_set_of_tools_part/) --.[12 Steps No Religion](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3wdrft/after_some_editing_in_the_dino_den_an_agnostic/) --.Having an urge to relapse?

Regret felt like it was eating at my soul for a long time. I'm not sure when but one day I realized that I still have *so much* time left. I have a son. I was filled with regret for how I wasted so much of his younger years. But then I thought of it this way: I stopped drinking when he was 5. He's only 7 now! There is an enormous amount of time that I have left (knock on wood) to make it up to him. He doesn't even know that I'm "making it up". If I can continue to move forward sober and with good intention from now on? I'm golden. 
Yes as Sinatra sings...* Regrets...I've had a few*..I used the Step work to take my inventory and when appropriate I reached out to apologize amend and repair when possible.  I did it with support.  ..Huge weights were lifted!..I worked to reconcile I pursued atonement I found redemption.
You're young. Lots of time to create good Karma. In my opinion that is really all that we can do. Try to cancel out some old bad Karma. For me I feed wild birds and provide a bit of a haven-attempting to offset a few years of hunting while a youth. It's really all I can do. Life only goes in one direction. Good wishes.  
Thanks for your post. I'm in my early 30's and feel the same way about how I spent my 20's. Right now I'm trying to look to the future and see how I can progress in the next decade without any interference from drinking. ..I'm hopeful in 10 years I'll be able to look back on my 30's and you'll be able to look back on your 40's knowing that we did the best we could without drinking to hold us back. 
I have this same problem and actually just posted about it. I think the best way we can recover from this regret is to make the future much better. Focus on the good times ahead and the power your sober self has to be happy!!!..Good luck my friend &lt;3
