I think it's time for me to write another SD post...A couple months ago I passed one year and at that time I checked back in here to thank everyone and to report that my life had dramatically gotten better in that time in large part thanks to SD. That is still true and I cannot thank those who wished me well enough for the support and encouragement...However lately I've been going through a pretty dramatic funk and my will to stay sober is definitely being put to the test. About 7 months ago I had taken a new job in NYC (which was itself a big deal for me after many years of being self employed). My wife and I moved here and things were going relatively well until the company I worked for had a mass layoff. I hadn't been particularly happy about the job so I wasn't so much dismayed at not having to work at that place anymore as I was intimidated by having to go back on the job search...Fast forward a few more weeks until now and I've really started to fall into a bit of a depression about the whole situation. I've been questioning our move to the city even though it probably still was the right decision to make. There are many opportunities for me in my field here but I truly dread the process of looking for more work; indeed I haven't even done much of anything at all to get the ball rolling. I'm having a hard time with motivation other than for the looming threat of going broke here and I'm starting to despair...Needless to say in total the whole thing is bringing back the first really strong desire for me to drink that I've had since I stopped. Things were so bad when I stopped that for a long time the initial momentum from quitting carried me a long ways but this increasingly heavy weight of the situation is bearing down on me. I needed to write here again and ask for help. I feel I've started to let things I learned while participating in SD early on to slip and I'm struggling to maintain the positive energy that brought us to our new life here in the city...I went for a long walk tonight and even considered stopping into a bar briefly but resigned not to drink today because I took the daily pledge and to at least write on here before making a bad decision.

Congratulations to you for making it past one year that's huge!  I'm sorry you're having a tough time and I hope you find a great new job in your field soon and become re-energized about living in NYC. I'm brand new here so I can't offer any sage wisdom but I can say that after a year plus I would not want to return to where I am now - in my first week sober having made the incredibly difficult decision to remove alcohol from my life. I'm feeling anxious wondering whether to apologize to people I behaved poorly with the last time I drank or whether to let that shame go and start fresh.  I don't want to have to make these decisions again and I'm betting you don't either. Also I know you know this but drinking will not help your job situation will definitely not help your wallet and the few minutes of escape it -might- provide are not worth the aftermath.  Keep going - I will NOT drink with you today.
I'm glad you did write on here...Throwing my resume at a black hole for entry level jobs was/is one of the worst things in my life right now.  I recently moved (twice) as well and will have to travel again.  I turned my real resume on yesterday.  Hot leads turned out to be busts has already made me reconsidering...All I know is that I've already wasted enough time with a relapse.  Drinking would only slow down the job search for me.  I'd binge for a week take a week to recover and I'd be right back where I was.  Time wasted more stress etc...Keep on keeping on.  Thanks for not drinking with me tonight.
