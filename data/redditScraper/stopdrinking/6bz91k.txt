So I finally got rid of all of the alcohol in my house yesterday. This is  after drinking two bottles of whiskey a week (plus various six packs of beer here and there) for nearly three weeks. In short I am very tired. Yet in the midst of all of this I am determined. I want this to be my last badge reset. Ever. My question is what tools methods or other "training wheels" did you all use to make it through the first three weeks? I can never seem to get further than day 16. Any advice is welcome! Regardless of the struggle I WILL NOT be drinking with you all today.

This sub was my main source of peer support in getting sober. Inspired partly by things I read here I put together a [rough plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3vn5g7/sunday_solutions_my_plan_and_path_from_day_1_to/) that I thought would suit me. Early on I needed lots of rest and found substitute drinks (sparkling water) and keeping occupied (gaming reading netflix and walks) helped. I found reading the posts here helped me to work through my thoughts on alcohol and crucially the shared experiences helped me to avoid relapse as I came to accept that returning to drinking would land me back where I left off.  I was on a waitlist for therapy and in the meanwhile I worked through some CBT exercises in a self-help book 'Overcoming Problem Drinking' - to me it was like daily mind-exercise...I used all sorts of visualisations to help me along the way. One was I imagined cravings as a rainstorm and I knew that whilst they might be uncomfortable they wouldn't cause me harm they would pass and make way for calmer weather - I can shelter in from the rain or put on my raincoat and wellies either way I can get through it! I learned to [dispatch my inner alcoholic voice as if it was a pushy and unwelcome cold-calling salesperson!](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/43kqb8/sunday_solutions_recognizing_and_refusing_my/)
Staying sober would have been impossible without help from others. I got a therapist went to rehab outpatient and got involved in AA. I had no alcohol in my home didn't hang with anyone who abused alcohol and didn't go to bars or events where drinking was a main activity. ..It is easy and more fun to be sober with help. It sounds like you could use more support. What are you going to do differently this time? 
Reposting:..Here is what I did when "I was ready to stop."..Said to myself in the mirror " I love you."..Committed myself to stop immediately regardless of the discomfort because on was on a path to lose everything...Saw my doctor. Was honest. Explained drinking and anxiety. Got honest counsel and medication...Read and posted in SD multiple times a day...Researched group work. Decided on REFUGE RECOVERY. Found a meeting that week and attended...Did not beat myself up. Accepted where I was in knowledge of what I was undertaking...Used Inside Timer app for guided meditation...Practiced breathing-focused relaxation. Take a deep breath through your nose until your lungs are full. Hold breath for 7 seconds. Exhale breath through your mouth for 5 seconds. Repeat. You will feel the stress wash away...Talked with my spouse. Was honest. She was/is terrifically supportive...Bought lots of carbonated drinks...Had snacks handy...You can do this! It is the best thing that I ever did. Scary and awesome. All about ME and no one else...Good luck!
When I felt I was going to struggle I would grab a coffee and read through all the posts in here. It's helped me so much. I found that after three weeks it has got easier. I won't drink win you tonight 
Well I am not allowed to give advice or endorse any particular method or ideology ----..But Allen Carrs Stop Drinking Now and Annie Graces This Naked Mind helped me lots..... I do go to 12 Step meets (just ignore the bits I do not like) and I like Smart Recovery Online. ..So it is a bit like making a cake ==== use the bits that are useful ==== leave out the rest ..AA is right about "one day at a time".
I wrote a few posts (one at 30 days one at 100) where I talked about what really helped me that I'm linking below. I'm including the 100 days post because while my first 30 days were very physically tough the next 60 or so were mentally tough (I can handle the physical terrible feeling but I was just drained every day for those next 60 or so days). Also the second post comes with the gift of hindsight for that first month and really summarizes what my day to day was like. ..https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/58im2x/30_days/..https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/5kxp14/my_thoughts_on_the_last_100_days/
