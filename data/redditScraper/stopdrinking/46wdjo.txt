I almost hate to call it a relapse.  But I did make the decision in October to quit drinking altogether and yesterday after the longest I've gone without any alcohol since 1994 (possibly 1993) I drank...I didn't plan it when I woke up or at all during the day.  The only problems I've had over the months have been on occasion having difficulty calming down.  Things have been good and I have positive feelings and adrenaline that are at times almost overwhelming.  Yesterday out of nowhere it became overwhelming.  I was on the verge of a panic attack from feeling good...Of course part of this was a bullshit reason to drink that I couldn't rationalize away (because I really would do anything to avoid a panic attack).  I probably would have been fine.  But I went to the store really feeling in that weird surreal state I get from these attacks (they are rare) and I went to the beer aisle changed my mind and got a six pack of non alcoholic beer.  I'd been drinking this lately just for some way to take the edge off after a day of exciting work.  It sort of works.  Anyway walked out feeling good about myself stopped at the gas station on the way home and bought a real six pack.  ..Once home I took a few minutes before I opened one but then I did and drank three pretty quickly.  I got a pretty strong buzz slowed down a bit but finished the six pack in maybe 2 hours total.  I was buzzed but not really inebriated still thinking fairly clearly knowing I would probably be pissed at myself today.  I didn't want to quit after the six pack.  I have always liked the act of drinking itself.  But I had that non-alcoholic six pack and was actually fine with switching to that.  I had no desire to get any more effect from the alcohol just wanted to drink more beer...It accomplished what I wanted.  No panic attack and I finally just relaxed turned my brain slightly down and re-watched the first three episodes of Deadwood (when sober I found I have no patience to see shows I've already watched).  I read bullshit on the Internet about Trump and Hillary and did jack shit the way I always did when I drinking.  ..Went to bed around midnight thinking wtf did I do that for.  Had dreams where I was drinking and needed to go to the store and get more.  Even woke up a bit in the middle of the night thinking fuck the stores don't sell alcohol until noon.  When I really woke up at my usual time around 7 I felt ok.  Six beers by the way is nothing to me.  So no hangover no desire to drink more...I'm pretty analytical so I asked myself what this meant and what I wanted to do now with all this.  Do I want to give moderate drinking a try?  Weekends only limited to six drinks or less something like that?  I decided no what I want is to not be a drinker at all.  I would love to be able to drink casually in moderation like some can.  But I know I can't.  Maybe I could for awhile but eventually I would slip...Moreover I really like the person I became being sober for four months.  I don't want to do anything to lose what I've gotten.  So I've decided to quit again starting over I guess.  I don't think it's really starting over though.  The last four months aren't negated because of last night.  ..At first I thought well around June 20th I'll be back to where I was yesterday.  Then I thought fuck that I'll be back to where I was yesterday tomorrow.  If that makes sense...Also I realized when I finally caved in and drank it really wasn't anything special.  I'm glad I didn't drink more than I did but still it just wasn't worth it.  I'm not even sure I liked it at all.  It made me realize I haven't been missing anything by not drinking...My concern is that the slip up will affect me in a week or so and I'll talk myself into drinking again.  After all I only had a six pack and it wasn't so bad.  But it wasn't anything special either so I'm going to try to remember that and how I felt today.  Not that I feel terrible I just really really don't want to do it again...Also wondering if anyone else has issues with too much adrenaline and energy not knowing what to do with it all while sober.  I don't think I've heard or read about that anywhere but it really seems to be my number one problem with not drinking.  I don't want to party definitely don't want to get messed up.  I just want to relax a little.  Video games help a bit.  Trying to find other things.  No desire for medication or anything like that.  Tea doesn't really help...Sorry this was so long.  .TLDR: drank after 4 months nothing really happened don't want to do it again though but need a new way to calm down occasionally.

I am high energy sometimes.  I get anxious about certain things.  I personally like endurance sports which empties me of all that baggage.  I get on a bike run swim whatever.  After an hour or two of going hard I find some peace.  Sometimes it lasts for days after only one session.  That is what works for me.  
They say relapses are planned.  I wondered when I got to this about the non-alcoholic beer..&gt; I'd been drinking this lately just for some way to take the edge off ..whether your use of the NA beer wasn't your drinking brain's subtle way of slipping you back into the habit. (Another thing "they" say is that non-alcoholic beer is for non-alcoholics!) ..I agree that you need a new way to calm down.  What do you think that could be?  I work on this with my therapist and sometimes I need to try new things even after I've settled on something because once she suggested a little "retail therapy" because I have a tendency to put off buying things for myself and I started to go a little overboard.  Other things I've used include exercise meditation organizing drawing playing piano going for a walk talking with friends etc.
