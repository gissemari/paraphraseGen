/u/coolcrosby had a great post yesterday on Dry People Dry Places: ..http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2szkp8/the_least_popular_advice_dry_people_dry_places/..He also mentioned in a response this: .."Sobriety is a whole new way of living new opportunities new potentials and a whole new outlook on the world as it is and my place in it."..I just want mention how much has changed for me during my three years since Sobriety. ..1) The past is dead. ..It is not going to be the same world. It is not so much that the world has changed but YOU have changed. You cannot expect the new you to interact the same way as the old you did. ..2) Hobbies immediately ..Boredom is one of the cruelest ways to relapse. Why? Think of how much drinking consumed your life. Now there is a giant hole. It needs to get filled. ..3) These hobbies can REINVENT you. ..Fuck now you're "the boring one." Oh you're not fun to be around because you don't want to do anything fun. Fuck those people. If anything now you have the chance to be the most interesting one. After I stopped drinking in three years I've tried these new things: ..Learning French.Rock Climbing .THREE Spartan races.Chess.Shooting .I've read over 100 books.Singing.Sword fighting (just started last week).  .....and I'M the boring one?..4) You are now an empty canvas. You have a chance to redefine who you are. ..A new era has begun! The reign of drinking has ended. You have this golden chance so utilize all this free time and energy into positive and enriching opportunities. ..Or...you can stay a bar all night every night. Until you're old and pathetic. ..It's your choice..

Number 2 man number 2.  Number 3 and 4 flow from that but I remember thinking how much stupid time I had to kill each night not drinking.  When I started I would literally spend hours on here and sober recovery to just make the time pass.  Now I rarely feel like I have enough time for all the shit I want to do.  Since I have gotten sober I have found the time to get a phd get a new job move across the country climb a couple mountains get engaged and buy a house.  F***ing crazy!
I really love this post! It's really all starting to sink in for me &amp; it's a good feeling. I'm looking forward to this path and thank you for these tips!

Ugh I love and needed this post. Thanks. 
Thank you so much- I really needed this and now I feel even better than I did!
Great follow up thanks /u/facadesintheday.  This morning someone is posting about trying to find something "cool" to replace drinking.  Setting aside the fact that my drinking was never terribly "cool" -- this approach is a very positive set of ideas.  I put it this way: what do I want to do with my life?  Go do it.
Yes my life is very much BS (before sobriety).    ..And.     AS it got so much better.
I joined a climbing gym two weeks ago! I have only went once because I don't have a climbing partner but it was really fun. I am hoping to go more often. .
