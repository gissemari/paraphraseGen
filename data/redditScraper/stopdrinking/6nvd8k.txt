I drank the whole weekend called in sick to work. My drinking got really out of hand after my boyfriend attacked me he made me believe I was going to die. I was scared I accepted that I was going to die. He's in jail now I struggle with being alone and I miss him so much...I have a daughter things are ok when she's with me when she goes to her dads I fall apart I drink miss work I can't cope. I'm so alone I don't know what to do. I'm fighting my urges and not drinking today Its so hard. Sorry this post is just to vent I just have to get how I'm feeling out.
