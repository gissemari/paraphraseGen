..**100 DAYS AGO I STOPPED DRINKING. AND IT FEELS PRETTY DAMN GOOD.**.JANUARY 4 2017 PLAYERHYPO...**Introduction of Blackouts:**..When I was drinking 3-8 drinks a day during the week and over 10 drinks a day on the weekend I didn't think I had too much of a problem. I did however at least consider the effect I was having on my body and my relationships. I had 8 blackouts in 2016. No clue what happened or how I got myself into bed. Did I say something regrettable? Probably. Did I do something inadvisable? Definitely. Did I hurt someone I care about in the process? Effortlessly. Now some might say  8 blackouts isn't that much.  [I challenge you to read all of this.](https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh27-2/186-196.htm) Don't worry I won't judge you if you don't....**Its not 100 days:**..Admittedly I have had 8 drinks since the 100 day signification. I know I know.  You really didn't make it a hundred days.  I started my  official' journey down this path 100 days ago. Longer actually 2 weeks before but I reset my starting date after a groomsman beer with my buddies. I had an Asahi beer on the Shinkansen bullet train while flying past Mt. Fuji I had a beer with a new friend in New Zealand and others when I felt it okay to have 1. The thing about having 1 was that I had trouble stopping to begin with. Before I started down this sobriety path drinks and conversation often left me a puddle-of-drunk somewhere around the world. And for each of those 8 drinks I felt a bit frazzled. Like I was following the White Rabbit down a hole I knew all too well. I would tell my Wife how stressed it made me to even have 1 and she mercifully supported my every uncertain moment and reassured me that I didn't need any of this. Honestly the number of days isn't the important part it's the reason to keep counting that does. I'll go more into detail on how we handled this later....**Why I drank:**..Anxiety was a crippling considerable foe constantly being wrestled with. Drinking seemed to quell the beast. In retrospect booze only fed and reinvigorated its resolve while it slept along with myself. I would wake up drained and raw considering my foolish actions the day before.  Did I really say that? I hope they weren't upset by my actions. I hope my boss couldn't smell it on my breath.  etc. I drank to soften my criticism of myself as we are all our own worst critics. I didn't pull my punches in this arena. I come from a very successful family which seemed to my fuel condemnation. My Grandfather was the youngest President of any University in the country at the age of 35 my Father was a respected Director of a international missile defense program and my cousins are top of their field Doctors scholars and medical professionals. I held myself comparably to their standard which admittedly was not fair but irrational criticism isn't reasonable is it? It took me a long time to consider that my path while different was no less meaningful than theirs. Who knows I may still be able to do great things. I feel a resurgent belief of the possibility to find that fulfilling purpose....**How I considered the path of Sobriety:**..One day while cruising the wave of internet bologna known as Reddit I stumbled across a subreddit called /r/stopdrinking. This was in one of my low mornings where I desperately searched for a ray of hope or at least distraction. I subscribed without reading a single post. Subconsciously I knew I needed inspiration I knew I needed stories of success and especially failure and I knew needed reason to practice. I lurked. That is to say I would cruise reddit as normal and I would often come across posts for the Stop Drinking subreddit. It effortlessly tugged on my heartstrings. It spoke to me as a struggling drinker to see others with a similar plight. It seemed strange to feel that sense of  community so close to my insecurities. To me it seemed to defy much of what I thought the internet to be: Mostly dick jokes and [cat gifs](http://giphy.com/search/cat). But honestly to see so many people be candid with their pain was cool! It was so deeply personal helpfully suggestive and overwhelmingly supportive. It was inspirational to read posts about the fathers people wanted to be for their children the wives people wanted to be for their significant others and simply the people some wanted to be for themselves...I kept this in the back of my mind for a while before I started. The random viewings of these stories got me thinking that this course of action might be the path of best results. When we would go out to a bar I would think about the person struggling with a DUI or the mother who was brave enough to put the bottles down or the decades-long alcoholic finally finding freedom and retribution. And it wasn't just their stories it was the support of people with their own demons finally being conquered that was so humanizing....**Seltzer-Water & Lime:**..My saving-grace my weapon against eeeeevil my excalibur. A night out can seem a frightful intimidating factor for one learning not-to-drink. There's so much temptation and it is very real. Everyone is ramping up for a good night getting warmed up and loosened up. Who wouldn't want to be a part of that? To this day this is still the most challenging thing for me. But hot-damn if seltzer-water and lime were not the best weapon for such a fight! The refreshing bite of citrus the effervescent light quality of carbonization and the ability to have a drink in your hand. Socially getting lost in conversation does no more damage than time away for restroom breaks. Hydration! Before I would drink quick and lose count of how many I had. Taxing on not only my wallet but also my mind. Seltzer-water & lime sympathetic to both....**Benefits of Not Drinking:**..*I'm rich! Or at least my money goes much much further...*I can drive home whenever I want to...*Wake up feeling good!..*[The 6-pack is back!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqN4sGaLn10) I haven't seen it since senior year of College. (Risky click of the day)..*Anxiety (on a scale of 1-10 1 being little to nothing 10 being a nightmare) is constantly under 3 when it used to average around 7...*More time for reflection. Consideration for the person I want to be...*Time for the people I want to be around...*Conversations hold more weight as they are remembered and considered....**Learn to Fail:**..One of the biggest lessons of this whole experience was the idea that failure is the ultimate show of incapability. Like if one were to fail they clearly and expectedly cannot achieve whatever goal that was set. This was as many don't give themselves enough credit for the furthest thing from the truth. Those 8 drinks since I started might have been considered profuse failures and I might have simply rebounded into drunken oblivion like a determined double-jeopardy. Instead I cut myself a break while having empathy for my future self. Just because I had a beer on a train doesn't mean I've failed in my path but I don't need to beat myself up about it. I learned that it wasn't worth it and I'll remember this experience to examine for next time. Let fails happen. It's the only way we learn. In fact go and seek out failures. Learn from it and seek out the next failure. You'll always be better for it...References and Credit:..*https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/..*https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh27-2/186-196.htm..*Chris Hardwick's philosophy on Sobriety usually through the [Nerdist Podcast](http://nerdist.com/podcasts/nerdist-podcast-channel/) Chris Hardwick's [Tweet response](https://twitter.com/hardwick/status/784839929939562496) Hardwick's [difference](http://nerdist.com/chubby-emo-chris-hardwick-of-2003-says-you-can-do-it/). ..Thank you for your time and attention...-Playerhypo..Jan 5 2017 (New Zealand Time)..Edit: Links references and formatting
