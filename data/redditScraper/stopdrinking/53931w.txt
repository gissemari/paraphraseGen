I thought I could handle it.  I thought because I didn't drive or miss work I was ok.  But I'm not I woke up this morning after drinking for 3 days straight and realized that I'm going to lose everything if I keep it up.  ..I started my bender when my girlfriend left me.  We met and immediately bonded over our struggles with alcohol and other substances.  I went a few weeks without drinking and was afraid to tell her but I when I did she was relieved and confided that she didn't want to drink as much either.  I had been doing good moderating and we built each other up in a way we would still drink but we wouldn't get drunk together (except on a vacation)...When she walked out on me she confessed to me that she had been hiding her drinking from me in the past week carrying a flask and that she "knows when she fucking up" and essentially didn't want to take me with her.  My initial reaction was "fuck you then if you're trying to stop yourself from dragging me to hell with you and if you really mean it when you say that you love me and you're honestly doing this because you love me and don't want to hurt me I'll meet you at the gates of hell and get back at you by getting started on a slow suicide."  But somehow today when I woke up sober I realized that I'm sick and I need to change...I'm also ready to tell people when they ask why I'm not drinking or why I'm can't have "just one."  I always used to say "I don't feel like it tonight" and would then drink the next night because normal people can do that.  But I'm not normal and I accept that.  I am depressed I have  PTSD from being surrounded by violence (firefighter/emt in one of America's most violent cities seen lots of people get turned into swiss-cheese from gunfire been assaulted by patients held lots of brains in while people choked to death on their own blood and been held at gunpoint off duty) and I'm a functioning (for now) alcoholic.  I'm not ashamed though I am ready to tell people and say "I can't drink because I'm not ok."..Also I'm hopeful but I've always been an "all or nothing" person.  As in if I couldn't get my full 2 hour workout in the gym I wouldn't go.  If I had a bad breakfast I wouldn't eat healthy the rest of the day I'd say "fuck it" and eat like shit.  Same with booze.  I was either not drinking but if I slipped up I'd say "fuck it time for a bender."  So like I said I'm hopeful but I am trying to be realistic and if I do slip up and get knocked off the horse I'm going to get back on it this time.  Anyone else dealing with a personality like that give this song a listen it's been getting me through the day: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFiMz2dAh2k

Welcome! Admitting this to yourself can be kinda scary but it's also very liberating (or at least it was for me). We're here to support you! 
Wow it sounds like you've had some rough experiences man...For myself I discovered that alcohol didn't make anything I'd been through or was going through any better. It only put off dealing with things and they got worse...Not drinking with you today!
