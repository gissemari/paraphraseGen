I drank a bit tonight and decided to pour out all of the alcohol I had left. I have gained a lot of weight the past year and hopefully this is the start of me turning it around. No one in my life knows I have been struggling with alcohol and it hasn't been easy.

Welcome to SD! Congrats on pouring it all out that is a beast of task. I was surprised how much weight I gained just from drinking it was crazy but it is a lot easier for me to exercise sober for sure lol. 
Hi well done and welcome
