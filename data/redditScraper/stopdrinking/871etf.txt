When I quit cold turkey one of the hardest things was overcoming the physical habit of reaching for my glass of wine which was always on my nightstand. It was almost as hard to reprogram myself to not reach as it was to let go of the actual alcohol which I now refer to as poison.  Having a strategy for this struggle was crucial to my success. I occupied myself with audio books mainly the Bible. It's been a year now and I reach no more!

Congratulations on Your Sober Solar Circumnavigation!
I've been buying bottle after bottle of grapefruit juice and sipping it like I used to drink beer while I play video games.  It helps a lot.
Ah you can't go wrong with the Word!  Phenomenal choice!  God's mercies are new every morning.  Congrats on making one year!  God bless you. &lt;3  IWNDWYT
