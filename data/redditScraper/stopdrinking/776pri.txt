It was terrible at first. Couldn't fall asleep couldn't stay asleep weird freaking dreams. I'm still struggling a bit with falling asleep although it's definitely gotten better and takes less time but I'm also sleeping through the night better. It goes without saying that it's AMAZING to not wake up hungover Every. Single. Day.

That's awesome. It feels so good to start sleeping naturally! :)
For me it took about a week to start really sleeping.  I shudder to think about how sleep-deprived I was all the time.  At about day 10 I just felt really tired went to bed and slept for 11 hours straight -- it was *glorious*!  Since then it's been normal -- and that's wonderful.
