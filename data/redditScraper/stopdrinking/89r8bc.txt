First time posting. I'm on week one previously I've only made it 12 days before relapsing. I feel great about it this time. I really want to remain sober. Last august I lost a good friend to heroin laced with fentanyl he had been sober for two years from opiates and booze. I spoke with him 2 weeks before he relapsed and died about how proud of him I was and we talked about how I wanted to get sober and stop drinking. After he died I relapsed and haven't had it in me to try again. I recently fell in love with a great girl and started a new great dream job and all the while drinking excessively and secretly and dangerously. I need to remain sober so I don't fuck this up. I want this and I can do it. The past few days have been wonderful with a clear head and hangover free. Currently listening to Jason Isbell's music which is great a lot of it deals with his own journey to quit drinking. As a former lurker off and on I want to say I appreciate all of you here on this sub.

Do you have a plan?  What will you do differently this time?
Welcome aboard! I will not drink with you today.
Love Jason Isbell (and the Dead even more).  Welcome!  IWNDWYT.
Good luck 
Welcome to the club! Get yourself a badge and start counting the days.    .    .ps. Wharf Rat is one of my favorite Dead songs.
Your Isbell title quote is what drew me in.  He's one of a few  celebrity  ex-addicts that really inspire me.  Best wishes to you in this journey.  
Love Jason Isbell!
Hey fellow wharf rat. I have been playing Jason Isbells music non-stop! You have a great taste in music! ..We got this! Hang in there. Too many good things to lose by picking up that first drink.
