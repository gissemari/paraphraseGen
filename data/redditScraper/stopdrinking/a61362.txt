Posted about 6 months ago. Posting again today. I've really been struggling with drinking recently - went through a devastating break up and struggling with coming to terms with being bisexual (26 f). Moved into my own apartment after living with with my bf for two years and I've been relying on alcohol to get through it. ..The Work/friend holiday events have been killing me because it's just one huge drinking event after another. This week along I had 3 work sponsored events and I have a friends annual wild party this weekend. I got so fucked up last night and was so sick this morning that I almost didn't make it to work. Then had another big event tonight...I'm really proud of myself tonight tho .. I only drank beer. The party started at 3:30 and is still going but I left at 10:30. I know it's lame that I'm proud for only drinking beer but I'm notorious for doing shots and drinking vodka sodas. It was cool to be able to remember things. It was weird being semi sober and watching all the drunk antics...I'm struggling a bit because my friends are trying to pull me back out to go to the club but I'm staying in. My body literally can't take anymore. ..Thanks for listening.

If you're struggling with your drinking then you should consider quitting altogether maybe read the FAQ or read this..https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3xckfo/how_did_you_get_through_the_first_few_days/
