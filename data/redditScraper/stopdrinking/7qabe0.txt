Hey guys I'm new here but figured I'd pop on by. Recently I celebrated a big milestone a year without drinking. It became a big problem for me and by 20 I was drinking everyday. Once I turned 21 it became a bigger daily routine. Wake up work liquor store drink sleep repeat. By the end of my 21st year I decided enough was enough and that I would kill myself eventually...I was drinking 1/2 of a handle every night of shitty quality liquor. I grew a relationship with it. It helped me sleep and numbed my feelings. I didnt sleep for 3 days when i quit and went to detox...Just looking back on those times I am glad I stopped drinking. I became very depressed and anxious after I quit even recently. I still struggle with panic attacks as they came back full force when I stopped. ..Now I'm 23 next month I might work a shitty job and have no college education but at least I'm in the right direction. I finally (for the 3rd time) decided to quit cigarettes 1 week ago except this time I have the vape which is helping me immensely...Wanted to say thanks to everyone who's on this forum I appreciate you all. Currently writing this feeling fatigued and a bit depressed. Oh well hopefully tomorrow will be better. Any day spent not drinking is a good one in my book.
