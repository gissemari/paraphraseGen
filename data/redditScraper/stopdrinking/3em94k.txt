We were distant cousins but kept in touch through Facebook the last year or so. I didn't even know she was struggling. Logged in today and saw a bunch of posts saying "RIP you'll be missed etc" Makes me that much more thankful to be sober today. I won't drink TODAY in memory of my cousin Bobbi.

My condolences my friend.  There have been a number of losses in and around the Cleveland AA community this last month so I am in a slightly mournful mode tonight too.

I'm sorry for your loss. Distant or close it hurts to lose someone to addiction.
I'm really sorry for your loss. Thank you for sharing - I've had an extremely bad day and I appreciate the reminder how bad things could get if I drank again. 
That is tragic.  I'm sorry for your loss.  
Heartbreaking. I'm so sorry for your loss. *hugs*
It's such a shame I'm so sorry for your loss my thoughts are with you.
Sorry to hear that. It's the unfortunate nature of what we're dealing with sometimes. But I'm glad you're sober - in my opinion that's the best tribute we can give others.
HUGS
