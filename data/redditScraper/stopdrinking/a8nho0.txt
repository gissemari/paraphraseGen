and hungover again. ..I suppose a perk of relapsing is that when you don't drink for a week straight the hangover is much worse. Maybe that will remind me not to drink again. ..UGH. Not today though. Today I'll just puke up battery acid and try to hide under the covers.

Getting sober based on pain and suffering never got me more than a couple weeks.  It is hard to live in constant pain.  Eventually I would feel better or forget and then the cravings to drink came right back.  That is why I needed to focus on the positives of sobriety.  I needed to learn the positives of using tools other than booze.  Now I am doing what I want to do every day instead of fighting against wanting a drink.  It makes it so much easier to be motivated and strong when Iget to do what I want.
What a deal right? The hangovers only get worse! It's awesome!..You got this.
We arrive because alcohol hurts. We stay because it sobriety heals. Don't leave before the miracle happens. Stay safe.
