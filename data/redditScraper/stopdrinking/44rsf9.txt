I have found that if I have a project to work on at home or something I can plan for and really put some time/work into it really helps take my mind off drinking...The negative of this is that sometimes I will choose projects that are not necessary. I'll spend money on things that we don't need and it can add up to quite a lot...I'm struggling with this right now. I have gotten through most of the physical withdrawals again (shaking sweating etc.) which is awesome but I want to stay focused!

I invested in Project Sobriety..- I went to meetings sometimes twice a day..- I read recovery-related books..- I journalled..- I connected with other sober people online and in person..- I made healthy meals..- I exercised..My reasoning behind investing in myself was that I really hated myself. Avoiding that and focusing on other things was in my view part of the problem that got me here: I refused to look at anything ugly about myself. Hell I still do this: it's a work in progress...If my bathroom was causing me huge problems and needed a huge repair: it's really tempting to start a new reno on the "dated" kitchen. But what needs work is my fucking bathroom: I just am too scared to start because I had NO idea WHERE to start.
Great job sticking with it to get to 7 Days. My toughest withdrawl days were days 4-6 and after sweating through that I wasn't going back. I was also going to sleep early a bunch. One way to keep focus is with a list of house projects. I find without a list I will do "preferred" activities like rearranging the deck chairs (great job!) and forget about some of the other things. I banged out a list of things this past weekend with a dozen items. None of which were all that difficult or dirty but that I would have otherwise deprioritized. During this time (2nd -3rd weeks) I focused on work and going to the gym whenever I wasn't working. Read r/sd and slept. Drive or take a train/bus somewhere you've meant to go. Read a book newspaper or magazine to feed the brain. At 7 days the full benefits of not drinking are within reach. One day at a time.
I was never into the show Survivor. Now I am. ..I have a backlog of 31 seasons. Dorky? Yes. Lonely? I chat with friends on imessage while I do it so not for me. Sober? Yup.
I spent a lot of my time drinking at night when others went to sleep. I had to distract from cravings so i played Skyrim till i passed out. When my "witching hour" no longer created cravings I stopped and slept like normal. 
Hey. .I'm suggesting this audio book on quite lot of my posts today just because I'm finding it has a nice mix of education truthful facts about alcohol and some hypnosis segments: .http://www.amazon.co.uk/Control-Alcohol-Stop-Drinking-Now/dp/B005BSO58E/ref=sr_1_10?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1454964671&amp;sr=1-10&amp;keywords=stop+drinking+now..Also... I'm going to the gym getting to bed earlier done job i've been putting off for ages... Really though; I'm just trying to be 'normal'. NO pressure one day at a time. There's nothing wrong with a bit of chill time reflection closing your eyes relaxing and finding yourself again.
