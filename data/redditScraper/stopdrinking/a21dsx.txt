Managed two weeks and relapsed .Had two glasses of wine and a pint .Still way less than what I used to drink at once .Is this the end of the world? Is my detox ruined?

End of the world? Nahhhh. . .Detox ruined?  It might set you back a little bit but as long as you don't turn this into a multi day binge I don't think you're looking at too much physical withdrawal.  ..Just use it as a lesson learned.  We all makes mistakes.  Dust yourself off and hope back on the wagon.  We're here for you
You did two weeks and that's in the bank. Whether your detox is ruined depends on your response. Personally I don't like that way of thinking because convincing yourself you've ruined it may also give you an excuse to stop trying. You've learned you can do two weeks and that maybe you need something else in your tool kit to help with similar nights or similar events in future. It doesn't sound to me like you've ruined anything. All the best.
