I'm happy every time I see someone post on this subreddit and talk about how their life is so much better now that they've gotten sober but me? Sobriety has had the opposite effect. I have struggled with depression my entire life and even though I've been taking my antidepressants as directed by my shrink (who knows I'm in recovery)... They just aren't working. Every day is a chore. I've literally tried every single combination of antidepressants over the past 10 years... I just can't find anything that will work...Please don't suggest AA. It's a great program and I'm working the steps but my anxiety and depression make it all but impossible to leave my house. Where is all the happiness and serenity I was promised?

You mentioned that your anxiety and depression make it difficult to leave the house. Have you visited the site http://www.intherooms.com  It is a free (anonymous if you wish) social media site for those in recovery and there are multiple tools such as speaker tapes support groups video meetings etc...I mentioned the video meetings and there are multiple per day chaired by fellow members. From my experience with them when I could not make to it a face to face meeting many of them are going through the same situation as you where they cannot leave the house for one reason or another...Give it a shot... What's the worst that could happen right?
I'm sorry to hear that.  Congratulations on your 10 months.  As many people here have posted usually drinking is just a symptom of other problems that have to be addressed.  If you have a broken arm taking a pain killer does not heal the break.  Like that quitting drinking does not heal the underlying issues...I'm happy to see that you're getting help with a shrink and medication.  Medication for mental health is not an exact/perfect science and may take a while to get right.  A relative is dealing with Diabetes.  It's been over a year since initial diagnosis and they're STILL having trouble getting their numbers to stabilize.  For them it's been more than 10 months and they're still trying...See of there are other things you can do.  Try playing online video games that require you to talk to your teammates/opponents.  That's not face-to-face and may be a good starting step...Hop in the [webchat](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/stopdrinking/?nick=pick_a_name) and start to socialize with some of us "group of drunks" through a text-based chat.  It might even help to become more active in posting to r/stopdrinking...We're here for you!
We don't always find everything we need in AA. I suggest seeking outside professional help. You mention a shrink but don't mention how often you're seeing them. If they're little more than a prescriber you may want to find someone you can set up some regular counseling sessions with. I went to a counselor / addiction specialist once a week for the first few months and it helped immensely... I've also struggled with depression and I've found that hands down the best thing to keep it manageable has been regular exercise and proper diet. I know it's intimidating to think about a big exercise routine when you're depressed. Everything's intimidating when you're stuck in a rut. I know it well. But start small start manageable. Push yourself through it. A big big part of sobriety is just showing up and doing things you really don't feel like doing. Because what we feel like doing as alcoholics rarely leads us down a healthy path. This is applicable as much to exercise as it is to other things that may very well help you - like going to meetings calling sober people for support and seeking professional help. ..When I find myself getting stuck in a rut or otherwise intimidated I tell myself that "if you want something you've never had you're going to have to do something you've never done to get it" 
Get on the correct meds.  AA can't change brain physiology.  Meds can.  Let your shrink know what they've prescribed to you isn't working and they'll get you on something different.  I have many clinically depressed friends in the program who struggle when they're not taking their meds/on the wrong meds/meds aren't working properly.
I'm in my 40's and this is the longest I've ever been sober. But I can offer some words of advice: it *is* better to be sober.. .Just stopping drinking doesn't all of a sudden throw a switch and make your life better. No it does **not**. That's a big fallacy. If your life sucked before when you were drinking well suck it up because it's *still gonna suck*.. .The thing with quitting is that it allows you to tackle these problems while sober. Understand that? **While sober**. Not under the influence of the drug known as alcohol. No ethanol in your veins. No mind-twisting physiological fuckups from the intake of it.. .You can tackle life's problems while sober and that's a big fucking step. But the problems are still going to exist and that can be daunting.. .So no life doesn't get better all of a sudden after a month after 3 months after almost a year. I'm still dealing with the same problems that drove me to drink. The thing is that I take my happiness in knowing that I'm doing it while sober. I rarely have a chance to look back at my life but when I do I know that the mistakes I made while sober were real mistakes while sober and I can't blame alcohol on them. . .Being sober is a tool that allows you to tackle things with a sober state of mind. Don't be sold on that all of a sudden things will get better.. .You're missing the point: you are now *sober*. So you are empowered.. .*Things don't get better without your action.* The thing you're missing is now that you are sober they won't be worse *because of alcohol*. It s tough on the inside looking in but on the outside you can see it if you look at yourself in the mirror. And you are now empowered. Try to understand that you now have **power** over your life. **You** do. Not alcohol. Not a life with alcohol as a part of it.. .I wish I could say "life will get better" but sometimes the throw of the dice makes things impossible to predict. But you can take homage in the fact that you are tackling life's issues while sober and that unto itself is a task.. .So be proud. Don't dismiss your sobriety.
Bill W. the founder of A.A. as I'm sure you already know was reported to have struggled similarly. You are not alone. Have you talked to different mental health professionals? Are there other tests they can run? The brain is vastly complicated and no one fully understands it. Those chemical imbalances can be tricky to diagnose as far as I understand it...I know drinking only makes it all worse.
38A I have dealt with depression my entire adult life.  Mostly successfully sometimes not.  No advice but I want to assure you that you will feel better.  You will.  I promise it.  Depression takes away our belief that things can ever be better.  But it can...If you haven't read Darkness Visible by William Styron I recommend it.  He quit drinking and his depression got worse.  But you know what? He got better.  His book is beautiful doesn't contain empty platitudes and it's short.
Hey man sorry about your predicament.  It can get better.  Don't give up...I noticed your last question.  If you're talking about the 12 promises the promises are based on you being halfway through your ninth step.  What step are you on?

Well the best bet would be to get your anxiety and depression under control. If your current shrink is just giving you pills and you aren't getting much out of it otherwise I'd suggest trying a different shrink. For me the reason I drank and did drugs was because I wasn't comfortable in my own skin... drugs and alcohol allowed me to silence the noise and feel normal/happy/high/kill the pain etc. I relapsed countless times but it wasn't until I did intense work on myself that I really started to "get it".  I don't know you're situation and can't possibly know what you've done thus far based on your post but this is what has worked for me. Whatever works for me may not work for you..I'd suggest the following-.-HEALTHY diet .-exercise  .-sleep (makes such a difference).-meditation (or prayer for those that are into that).-meetings (or social interaction with another recovering person who has at least a year clean and sober...someone who has what you want in terms of serenity/sobriety).-therapy both with meds and with a shrink that can't prescribe you meds. I find that if they can't write you a prescription they are much more likely to offer a better array of solutions...I wish you the best of luck in your journey and hope you find the happiness and serenity you're looking for.
It sucks that you are having a hard time. I've been sober 504 days and just recently I'be become more depressed and anxious. There is some advice I can give you just from my own experience: you must workout everyday- even if you just walk. Find a Podcast you like and walk until it is over. Drink lots of water. Depending on how long you have been on your anti-depressant if it is not work switch to another one. Sometimes it takes a few tries to get it right. Are you taking anything for anxiety? Ask for something!.. Life is all about the ups and downs- as alcoholics we don't get the option of drinking our downs away- we have to cope with them ourselves. IT IS HARD. As part of my treatment I developed a life plan to keep me sober- it involves exercise classes (yoga and Pilates) diet relaxation time learning new things and lots of other factors. Your therapist should be able to help you develop a plan that will work for you. Just start where you are and go from there don't put too much pressure on yourself but keep moving forward. You can do this!
Sorry you are suffering. I'd suggest getting a second opinion. You may be misdiagnosed and thus medication isn't working. You sound willing but painfully stuck. Try a different psychiatrist. 
I can empathize. I was much happier when I was drinking.  My life is not and was not a mess.  I don't need to pick up any pieces.  I used to be happy but I was basically binge drinking every day for years.  Now that I am sober I am lonely unhappy uncreative and generally unsatisfied with life.  I even feel less energetic and generally less healthy.  The only thing that keeps me from picking back up a bottle is that I can't stand the idea that I can't be happy without alcohol.  ..Sorry that I don't have any advice but maybe it helps to know that someone else is having trouble finding sobriety's promise land.  All that being said I have no intention of drinking again and you shouldn't start back either.  The idea that happiness can come in a bottle is every bit as stupid as it sounds.
Depression needs to be fought on 2 fronts meds and therapy. If you're not getting this from your current shrink then you need to find a new one. The United Way can be a great source for finding resources to help you with this. Also if you are unable to leave the house to go to meetings AA is online. You need to communicate directly with a sponsor to work the steps and hopefully find some peace in sobriety. Some areas have people that will bring the meetings to those who can't get to meetings. Check with your local central services about that. 
Are you helping others stay sober working with newer people?..How often do you and your sponsor get together to do step work and study the Big Book?..Do you have any commitments? (coffee secretary treasurer greeter etc.)..Bill W. suffered from [depression](http://www.silkworth.net/aahistory/billw_depression.html) too...
No one promises happiness and serenity. You have to go out and get it. Go see a new doctor. Go to a meeting. I've found peace happiness and  a whole lot of other stuff in the rooms of AA so I don't really know what to tell you. It's a program for people who want it not for people who need it.
I feel the same way right now.  I find myself not wanting to admit it to my support system in AA because I am ashamed for not feeling better. It is very frustrating. 
I don't really have any better advice or suggestions for you from those who posted above. What I did want to do is thank you for sharing. It takes a tremendous amount of courage to share what you are going through even on an online message board such as this. Please don't give up hope. Sobriety may not be your final answer but at least it's no longer part of the problem. I honestly wish you nothing but the best and want you to know there will always be people here to listen. 
Hi I would like to suggest cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). You may have heard of it but it's a way of combatting automatic negative self-destructive thoughts that contribute to depression anxiety guilt etc. ..I recommend reading 'Feeling Good' by David D Burns. Read some of the free chapters on Amazon. It's an amazingly effective book that has really helped me...I agree with other people here that sobriety does not automatically make your life better. It just removes one of the problems from your life. There may still be other major issues to work through - and you'll be in a much better state to do that if you're sober...Wishing you good vibes...
