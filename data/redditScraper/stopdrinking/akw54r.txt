How are yah? You rocking out many days sober my friend or did you just realize this life isn't for you. Worried about withdrawals. We can relate. Heart pumping anxiety night sweats vivid dreams that aren't pleasant etc. Yeah we can relate. Thought you figured it out felt great because six months passed and then you relapsed and then you cursed God because we never signed up for this? Yeah I can relate. 4 years in the making. I should have overcome this so many years ago and here I am. Do me a favor though. Regardless of feeling like a nonentity as the withdrawals hit yah try to say hi to your neighbor. Or your coworkers or anyone else. It's so easy for us to think that the world revolves around our struggles. It doesn't. Lots of people out there and they need help to even when we are struggling to find our own. Welcome by the way. Never give up.
