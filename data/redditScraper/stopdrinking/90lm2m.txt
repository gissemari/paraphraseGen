I have been slowly awakening to my drinking problem. I am out of state visiting an old friend. I am overwhelmed with anxiety. I really want to drink! I'm not sure if it's my company or the old drinking habits we had together. The struggle is really real for me today.  .

My family=huge trigger
In my experience absolutely yes. Tone of voice past history unresolved issues. All kinds of things. ..
My daughter who I adore and have a wonderful relationship with is a big trigger for me because....guilt.  :(
