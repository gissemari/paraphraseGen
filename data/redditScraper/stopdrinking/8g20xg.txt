I'm sure I'm not the only one in recovery who struggles to love themself. It's a long journey getting to self acceptance. What are some things you do to nurture your relationship with yourself?

Try to cut myself some slack as I've learned to try to cut everyone slack- most of us are doing at least 75% of our best most of the time.  Try to remember to leave my ego at the door.  Work with other alcoholics every day.  
One of the things which helped me was 'Feeling Good' by Dr Burns. Basically he writes about ways that we can be unfair to ourselves...Writing things down is helpful too!
I actually love myself when I'm sober. I hate myself when I'm hungover. Trying to remember this daily :)
When I expect too much of myself I remind myself that I would never dare expect so much of other people which would be totally unreasonable and unfair. Why? Because people are human and make mistakes and I can only expect them to do their best. Why should I hold myself to a different standard when I'm cut from the same DNA as everybody else?..Oh yeah! I'm allowed to make mistakes. The only rule is to learn from them and to do my best right now.
Check out today's [AoK Monday](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/8fy1kl/aok_monday_have_you_been_kind_to_you_lately/) there is an article about 17 ways to be kind to yourself &amp; all the comments are what other sobernauts do...[High Five](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg) my friend. I am finding the road to my recovery to be one hell of a journey; not just quitting drinking but also finding myself letting go of my past facing things I have repressed learning to accept/like/love myself all of it. All I can do is suit up and dive in :D
well if i have a low day like i have been having recently i just tell myself it could all be much worse - because when i drink i hate myself tenfold. the mental anguish is almost unbearable and it takes days to subside. ..i remind myself of that awful sinking feeling and try to pat myself on the back. i'm not drinking. it's in the past. this is the new me and the new me is sober. she's more patient she's kinder she's less volatile she's not aggressive or anxious or overwrought. .

Been listening to one of my favorite teacher's the last few days Adyashanti. One of the themes: *'If you were a person you cared about how would you treat yourself? How would you talk to yourself?'*..I'm seeing a lot of self-beatings here today in the posts and my heart goes out to everyone. In my experience love is the answer and that begins with choosing which inner voice to align myself with :)
