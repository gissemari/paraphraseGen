Hey drunks. Lately I've been dreaming about using pills and drinking and I find myself throughout the day most days having short fantasies of smoking meth. I only did meth a handful of times -- booze was my drug of choice. I feel like there's a part of me that still badly wants to get wasted any way it can. I'm lucky that I'm living in a sober community so I have huge incentive to stay clean. Just wondering what y'all think of cravings (like what's behind them? I know that seems like an obvious question so what I mean is do they indicate an increased chance of relapse?) and how you best handle them.

Well of course there IS an increased chance of relapse if we're having a craving. Especially those ravenous ones. :P..I *just* posted about using dreams here actually. To me they help me feel how disappointed I would be in myself if I made that mistake. It steels my resolve to wake up and realize I didn't screw up!..Full disclosure: I am a former meth addict myself. Occasionally I do find myself with similar cravings. Some say they may never go away...Meth use literally drives us insane. We are in a psychotic state while under its effects and (as far as I know) there is nothing else that has such an effect. Those cravings do get easier to ignore...How I handle cravings for alcohol is I reach out to my support. I talk about it. I talk about why I want to use and I verbally confirm that it will not fix the problem. Any meth cravings get a response of "that's not sane thinking" and I ignore it. [It is literally just a memory of my sick brain enjoying a flood of dopamine in a psychotic state](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/meth/body/) and it is not worth considering aside from considering how ridiculous it is that I would ever want to go back.
