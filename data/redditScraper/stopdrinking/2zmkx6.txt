I'm going to start doing my daily pledge when I am at a higher risk of relapse. When I do it first thing in the morning I feel great and like I can take on the world. Right now I feel anxious irritable and tired. Just ran into some people who I was not in the mood to run into because I look like shit (allergies or a cold not sure). Because I've had a long day at work and school this makes me want to drink because I am apparently 12 years old and can't deal with stupid shit like this. All I want to do is drive to the liquor store and drink. ..Instead I am going to drive home stay there and not drink today.

Good job coming here and posting this now I can relate to how you're feeling. You're doing the right thing - get home chill and make it your goal to get to bed sober. Tomorrow will be a better day :)
&gt; I am apparently 12 years old and can't deal with stupid shit like this...Looks like you just did. :) Don't belittle yourself it's an accomplishment to let yourself feel those shitty feelings and choose to talk about them instead of escaping them via liquor. Victory!
I made a chart and crossed off each hour as it passed. .. http://i.imgur.com/9WumIUV.jpg..Doing so was like renewing my commitment each hour. 
You are way cool  doing this.  I found out also that little stupid things can make me wanna drink.  Actually it's been interesting seeing how unimportant some of those things are.  Keep up the good work!
Good on you!
