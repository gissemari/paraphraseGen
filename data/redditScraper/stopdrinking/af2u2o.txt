It would be the perfect night to drink. My significant other is out of town and it's the weekend. I'm alone. I could just go buy a bottle or some beers. But then that would just be the same old story that it always is. I would wake up head spinning dry mouth utter despair. I would make myself sick thinking how I could have just said no and none of that would have ever happened. Well this time I'm not going there. I am going to do whatever I want tonight except drink. I am going to remember all of those mornings like that and make the choice right here right NOW that I will thank myself for tommorow. I don't have to go through all of that I can just hang out here and I can learn to just be alone without choosing to self destruct. If you're struggling tonight please just know that I am right here with you NOT drinking. Thanks everyone for being here and being my safety net right now.

You got this friend. 
I will be here with you sober.  
I'm not drinking tonight either... so cheers to that! 
I know how you feel. :(. But I too refuse to drink tonight despite really really wanting to.  Stay strong. 
IWNDWYT!

I am with you.  I believe in you.  Stay strong.  Read.  Watch Cops. Chill.  Anything but drink. 
Thanks for such honesty.  It must be in the air tonight.  I was feeling the same tonight.  IWNDWYT
I'm right there with you. I'm on day one and it would be so easy to drink tonight. I'm alone. No one would know... but I am choosing to binge watch something on Netflix and go to bed early.
Thank you! 
Good work playing it forward! IWNDWYT
