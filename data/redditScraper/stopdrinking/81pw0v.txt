My 1 year comes up on May 15th (my badge is proof that a serial relapser can pull this off. I had reset it so many times I felt like I was wasting the mods time). ..I had initially planned on saving these and giving them as gifts to people. I hid them in a cabinet behind a bunch of stuff. For some reason I had strong urges yesterday. I was reading The Willpower Instinct and it was talking about forgiving yourself if you relapse and my brain jumped to the idea that maybe I could have a drink and just forgive myself after. Funny thing is I'm not even reading that book to help me stay sober its for my procrastination! stupid brain......Well that subsided after an hour last night as I fell asleep. Woke up and the thought was still there. So I decided to literally pour a little over $300 down the drain this morning. How is yalls morning? IWNDWYT

I'm so glad you did it! I'm pretty sure you actually **saved** money by pouring out those bottles. Imagine you had given in to temptation opened one of them and poured yourself a drink. It would probably have tasted lovely... Do you think you could've stopped after one drink? (**I** honestly don't know - perhaps you could have - but I'm asking you.) There's a strong likelyhood you would've wanted more... In the worst case you might have ended up drinking all three bottles (maybe within just a couple of days). And after that... well you would have hated yourself - and you'd probably be thinking along these lines: "To hell with it. I already screwed up. I might as well go on drinking now." And then you would have started buying booze again... and **you would quickly have spent hundreds of dollars** on it. As everyone in this subreddit knows when it comes to alcohol we're prepared to spend sums on it that we never would on other commodities...I'm not saying this would necessarily have happened to you. But now there is zero chance! :)
Hey sober twin! (My quit date is May 14th.) Pouring out liquor is hard. Congratulations on the great work you're doing.
Wow that must have been difficult - yet very satisfying. While reading your post I was imagining the smell being a bit overwhelming and it made my stomach turn a bit!..I'm here not drinking with you today :)
You may have poured the whiskey down the drain but you saved your sobriety! Way to go!!!!! IWNDWYT
