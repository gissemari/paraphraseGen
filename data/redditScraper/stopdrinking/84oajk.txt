It has been a long 6 months but probably the most fulfilling and enriched time I have spent with myself in many years. My body has thanked me my inner self has cheered for me and my family has appreciated me. You know what they say about hindsight being 20/20? It's true. Looking back gives the mind perspective and allows for better choices in the future. When I look back I see a lot of years of internal struggle and precious time wasted on a "good time." No more fake "good times." No more regret every morning and wishful hopeless thoughts about stopping what I am doing to myself. I finally did just that I stopped. That is all it took. It sure is not easy to stay stopped but I did it me and here I am looking back after 180 days and all I can think about is I want 180 days more. If you are struggling in the early weeks and months don't give up. Besides when it really comes down to it the only thing that has ever stood in your way is just that: you. Live happy and love life one day at a time. IWNDWYT.
