A few nights ago I fucked up. I was out drinking with some friends and was at about an 8. I barely remember it and in retrospect I can only look at myself with disgust. At some point I leaned over to my girlfriend and said we should be in a polyamorous relationship with her roommate. Did I say it seriously or as a joke? I don't know. I just know I would never say or think that sober in a million years. She was bothered by it and we haven't spoken since two nights ago aside from me trying to make it up to her by paying a parking ticket. What's worse is that on Super Bowl Sunday evening apparently when I was drinking I got to a point where I was so hammer (I distinctly remember a gap in time I missed entirely for a few hours) and she says I called her said roommate hot. It's been a rough weekend struggling with mental health as is. My therapist says this event is not catastrophic and that our relationship isn't over but the break is probably good for us because I'm with my gf every day. I'm just worried and don't want to drink anymore. It's just a sucky feeling. I feel like I've let her down. I feel ashamed and immature. I feel guilty. And I'm upset because she had been waiting for me to turn 21 (a few weeks ago) because she and I do enjoy going out. On the aside our relationship has been a little rocky with us having different opinions on things. Is there hope? What should I do? How can I make it up to her? I want to give her space but I feel I should approach her at some point and try to show her how much I appreciate her. I just miss her...Edit: gf and I have been together for 2 years. We've seen each other every day but she's been a little upset with me for not fully understanding situations and the way she thinks (she has admitted sometimes it's unfair to ask me to read her mind). My depression makes it hard to engage sometimes and I wish I could be more reasonable. ...

Don't look backward.  You can't unring the bell so don't beat yourself up for what you said.  What's more troubling is the blackouts (or time travel as I used to call it).  All you can do is move forward and do your best to end your relationship with alcohol so you can repair your relationship with your significant other.  You can count on our support.  
You're focused on your girlfriend and why shouldn't you be - you said some stupid shit. It's natural to be concerned and perhaps worried about your relationship with her. Do you think you are more concerned about her or yourself in this situation?..I've had depression for longer than I have been an alcoholic and alcohol makes my depression so much worse. It also makes my anxiety worse. I'd go so far as to say that when I am drinking any potential progress I am attempting to make with my mental health is effectively put on hold. And I usually end up sliding backwards. ..Struggling with my mental health and then drinking does two things: it makes my mental health worse. My worsened mental health makes my alcoholism more active. Which makes my mental health worse. And so on and so forth. I can't just get rid of my mental health issues. I also just can't get rid of my alcoholism. I can stop drinking though. ..I'm not sure if you need to stop drinking. I don't know if you believe yourself to be an alcoholic or someone who doesn't have a problem or something inbetween. It's obvious that alcohol is causing problems though. When alcohol has cause trouble in my life - I've continued to drink despite negative consequences...I think it's great that you want to quit. I just hope you want to quit for yourself.
