I don't post here much but I really want to say thanks to the SD community for inspiring me to quit poisoning myself. It's been a whole year since I quit drinking and I don't think I could have done it without having this special group of strangers all struggling  with me. ..You're all great keep on quitting. .I sure as hell won't drink with you today!..
