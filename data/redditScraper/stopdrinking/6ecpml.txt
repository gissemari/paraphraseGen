Hey all so iv been sober 7 months after drinking much of my 20s away. The past month has been really hard as I had a mental health break down and spent two weeks in a psyc ward to get my bipolar depression under control and meds back on track. While there I had a sever reaction to one of the many medications they were putting me on and ended up in the ER because I couldn't keep fluids or food down for almost two days (after fighting with staff to get me sent to an ER for 20 hours finally my wife came and flipped shit and got me the medical care I needed). Then has an endoscopy and several tests then bed ridden for 3 days. ..I finally get home and due to the stress on my body my doctor had me stay home from work another two weeks. I struggled through all this and did not drink. No money nothing to do but it didn't matter because I'm staying sober for me and no one else. I have to do this so I can have a happy and healthy relationship with myself my wife and family. I love this sub and the irc chat you are all the best...For anyone struggling keep going keep fighting and love yourself..I will not drink with you today..Thank you all!
