I am so angry because he hid it from me. He was scared of what I would say. I saw him lift up the backseat of his car and I knew. So when he went to sleep I went and found the bottle in his car hidden under the seat just like I thought. I want to guilt and shame him but I know that won't help him. How can I help him steer back onto the course lovingly and without anger? I want to understand how this feels from the other side. Thank you all keep fighting the good fight.

I'm sorry I am sure your mind is going a million miles a minute. It is unfortunate but unless you have been through this there is nothing I could say that will make you understand. Does he know that you know yet? Have you been to or are willing to go to ALANON to better understand the dynamics of a loved one that is an alcoholic?
