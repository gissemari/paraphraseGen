Hi all!..Well it's been two weeks since my one night bender and sober since Jan 5th. Since the bender I have not dreamed about alcohol I certainly want nothing to do with it and just loving sober life with all it's problems.  Since my relapse I have created a list of tools that I go through when ever anxiety hits. Visit my addictions counselor when I can afford it as it's $100 per visit. Work out 5-6 times a week signing up at the local pool soon. Also have upped the meditation along with doing a a lot of self help work and gratitude/thankful work...This sub has really helped me along the way and have met some wonderful people that I correspond with. I have gone from suicidal to loving the crap out of life. not that I do not have down moments or down days :)..Thank you StopDrinking!

Wonderful stuff - gratitude is one of the keys to happiness for sure. I've heard some people say that so long as you remain grateful for being sober you will remain free - works for me. 
In the beginning I thought my gratitude list was for dragging myself out of the doldrums now I find that if I maintain my gratitude's daily they keep the doldrums at bay. ..Well done on the last 15 days and a big thanks to StopDrinking from me as well.
