So this is my second attempt at a sober lifestyle. I'd had 9 months sober up until this past summer. I decided to try moderating. It worked for a while until it didn't. Long story short my last night drinking was spent verbally berating a Pastor at some shady bar at 1AM on a weeknight. I feel sick about it but I doubt I'll ever see him again let alone have a chance to apologise...The worst part for me right now is dealing with all the guilt I'd let go of the first time around. Every bad thing I've ever done drunk has come back to haunt my dreams. Things I've already made amends for feel like they just happened yesterday. I think this is because my apologies almost seem worthless now because I chose to slip back into my old ways - to allow myself to become that awful person I had apologised for so often. I feel like I cheated them. I meant everything I said to them because at the time I truly believed I'd never relapse - but how would they know that? I almost feel like I should phone and confess to them all - but I know that would be socially awkward. ..Anyway I'm just glad my second 'rock bottom' wasn't as detrimental as my first. I could have just as easily found myself involved in a street fight or getting run over as I crossed a busy street. Calling some drunk Pastor a philanderer and a hypocrite was entirely baseless and cruel but it could have been worse...I guess that's all you can say. Things could have been worse - and they'll certainly get worse if I pick up another drink.....

Welcome back. ..I find that nothing changes if nothing changes. What's going to be different this time? 
I never tried for a "sober lifestyle."  I stopped drinking for the day and then another and so forth--and the sober lifestyle happened.
