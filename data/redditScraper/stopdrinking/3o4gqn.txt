I've been on jury duty this week. This morning in line at the cafeteria the man wearing a suit in front of me (I assume he was an attorney) had the look of a heavy drinker: puffy eyes bloated face red skin tiny beads of sweat on the brow. Maybe I am prejudiced seeing something that's not there. But anyway it made me think about my own life and drinking habits.  ..The myth of the 'functional alcoholic' is insidious. Unbeknownst to this individual anyone can see that 'functional' is no way to live. I remember being in this man's shoes struggling to keep it together and act professional. "Just get the job done."  ..I'm happy with my decision to move beyond functional. I hope others do so as well. Thanks to everyone here for their support.

Working on it...
Thanks for sharing that story. I too have seen similar symptoms in those around me. Makes me wonder if I am just projecting.
That visual hits pretty close to home not too many years ago.  Imagine leaving that boozy aura in your wake on an elevator or standing next to your client in court I shudder at the memory.
Whew! Been there done that! I don't miss the hangovers while at work...trying to convince myself that nobody else notices how much I'm hurting...ug!
I see this at work a lot of the time.  There is one guy in particular who drinks every night (a 12 pack of beer at least) and isn't shy about who knows how much he drinks.  The smell of him every morning along with seeing how he shakes really reminds me of why I decided to quit drinking.
Thank you so much for posting this. I find the term functional alcoholic really frustrating. I like to cling to the idea that I was a functional alcoholic except that I wasn't functional at all. I just was really good at hiding it at least I thought I was probably not as much as I thought.
