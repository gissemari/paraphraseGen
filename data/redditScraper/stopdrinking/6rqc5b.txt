Just be careful. Most people who are addicted and quit for a period and then return to it can handle moderat drinking fine for a little while after the abstinent period. But then it gets back to where it was before and they want to quit again. Maybe you really are okay but also maybe just be careful of things getting back to where they were when you felt compelled to quit.
