Hey guys ..Just stumbled upon this sub Reddit in self help and I cannot believe the amazing community of people here just trying to give support. I'm a 24 year old male that has been drinking since I was about 14. It was always  a casual thing until about a 2 years ago. I was at one point very career driven and physically fit. My drinking problem started to change things when I moved in with my ex-fianc  at 22. The stresses of a new job and new living arrangements contributed to what I consider now a  heavy addiction to alcohol.  I lost the love of my life to alcohol and since have been very depressed. I'm starting to drink more and have gained 35 LBS in the last 6 months. I got a DUI in March and have been struggling to quit ever since. Sadly I am not sober yet. The longest I have gone is 3 day in a row somehow I just fall right back into my habit. ..I'm up to an absolute minimum of one pint of hard liquor a day some days I finish a fifth. ..I still have a great job and fear that may be the next thing to go if I don't stop. I absolutely hate who I have become but I know that tomorrow is a new day. I'm ready to overcome this addiction that has overcome me.  I hope to meet some people here who have successfully taken the path that i am walking now. If you have gotten this far thanks for reading

Hi. 28 years old and relate a lot to ur story. There's a stop drinking chat available on the side bar if u feel inclined! It's helped me a lot.
Good luck mate. Just take it day by day for a while. Grab a flair here it really helps to watch the numbers tick up.
Congrats for taking the first step on recognizing that you have a problem. Taking the second step by writing it here is a big accomplishment. My situation was very similar to yours. I encourage you to cruise SD read some stories. The book This Naked Mind has helped me and a number of others here.  I bought a copy and encourage you to do the same but the author Annie Grace has offered SD users a [free digital version here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDbookclub/comments/4khj4s/this_naked_mind_available_free_to_sd_users/). Welcome!
Just keep coming back. Read everyone elses stories too. Good luck to you. &lt;3
