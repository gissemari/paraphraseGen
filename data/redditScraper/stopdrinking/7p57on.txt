I am so anxious and depressed The last  two weeks have been an onslaught of dread procrastination and self loathing. Tonight I was so ready to dive head-first into a bottle of anything. I wanted SO BADLY to check out of being alive and live in a bender. ..Until I re-read the [letter to myself](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/5nman4/a_brutally_honest_letter_i_wrote_to_myself_to/) I posted one year ago and had forgotten about. ..It is **brutally honest** and **incredibly effective** at reminding me why I quit. I suggest you write one for yourself and re-read when the cravings come up. Use mine as a template and give it a shot. ..This community has been crucial to my recovery. I want to give back in any way that I can. Let's do this together! So tonight I am doing sets of push ups and squats and trying to help anyone out there who might be struggling too.

Love your letter. Have saved it to my drive. Thank you! 
Thank you for the inspiration. I wouldn't have to change much from your letter either. Funny how that works. ..I'm currently fighting the urge not to go to the store and buy a bottle. IWNDWYT! 
I wasn't expecting to identify with everything in your letter....but I do. .I haven't felt like drinking but I have been wondering why I quit in the first place. A little distance between myself and those negative consequences makes them fade a little. You letter brings it all back.Thank you again. Great post.
