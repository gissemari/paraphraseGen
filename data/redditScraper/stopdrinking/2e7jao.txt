This time around the detox wasn't nearly as bad as some times that I had experienced even in the midst of my drinking days when I still had some illusion of control. I had been trying to cut down the last few months and even spent most of June and the first full week of August totally sober. I think that's why this detox has been relatively easy in comparison to the past. I was shaking like a leaf on the first day and on the second had some cravings a LOT of moodiness and a LOT of brain fog. Still feeling foggy and the psychological cravings haven't totally passed (nor will they) but on to the good news.....Tuesday after a few really rough and eye-opening nights I joined the subreddit. I had been complaining about unemployment on the chatboard yesterday before I took the bus to my SO's place due to its close proximity to Worksource. I arrived at Worksource with just enough time to grab some pamphlets about what they have available and to see what seminars they had today and tomorrow. I had a job interview for a teaching assistant position at a local private preschool earlier in the week but decided I really needed to commit to employment (and sobriety) and not just wait to see how this pans out. I also had some really good talks with the SO last night about our game plan. He pretty much said "I will support you and do whatever you say will help you but I can't understand what you're going through so I just want to help point you in the direction of those who can." I woke up early this morning with the intention of hitting Worksource early for a seminar and filling out applications but dragged my feet just long enough to get a phone call from the preschool offering me a job. I start Monday...This is going to sound a bit hokey but honestly I think this happened because I finally committed to sobriety after dancing around the subject and half-assing it for a long time. I have been wanting to be a special needs teacher at a special needs preschool/kindergarten for a long time and this is a huge step in the right direction. Plus it's a ten-minute bike ride from my house. It feels like the universe is telling me I'm on the right track finally...I'm worried about my struggles after I get my first paycheck. It's really easy to stay sober when you're broke (though I somehow find some not-so-great ways to get alcohol anyway) so I'm going to keep you guys posted. Just letting you know that I heard some VERY good news today and while I'm not out of the woods yet things are looking up and rather quickly. ..I am worried about this weekend. I have a game night (that is usually accompanied by drinking with friends of mine) and a bowling night with SO's friends(that was advertised as beers and bowls). Got the SO going to both events (I'm more worried about bowling honestly his friends are pretty big drinkers and the friends of mine going to game night were supportive of my sobriety in the past and just aren't big drinkers themselves) so that will help. Still. Fingers crossed.

Stay strong and reach out or even GTFO if it become too much. Have a plan/exit strategy. Make sure the SO has your back. You can do this good luck!
Good for you and good luck on the new job.  Remember to make sobriety your priority.  ..Oh as to this weekend it it ain't here yet.  You have plenty of time to work in a AA meeting or two.  ; )
