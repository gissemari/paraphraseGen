Ugh I keep dreaming that I've relapsed then waking up with that horrible feeling of shame and failure. What the hell jerkbrain?
----------immediate responses--------

Yeah I still get them once in awhile. I have relapsed hundreds of time in my dreams. Very common :)
I had a drinking dream recently.  It was the first in about a year.  I see them as gifts reminding myself that I don't want to go there again.  Going through the dream was pretty horrific though.
Drinking dreams quitting my job/getting fired dreams dreams of telling (yelling at) my family how I really feel.  I think all this stuff is totally normal for a person trying to quit drinking.  
Had one last night. "woke up" unable to remember half the evening cos I'd got drunk. It's always a really disconcerting feeling
I've had this happen several times but never while on a sober streak. I'll wake up with that sinking feeling that you did something stupid in a drunken manic state that you can't really remember and are going to regret...After looking through phone/text/email logs I'll realize it was something stupid I apparently did in a dream but it seems to be only after passing out wasted the night before. Ugh... don't tell me this happens sober too :(
