I am on a new journey to being sober. I have been drinking for 15 years and have finally come to the realization that moderation is not an option for me. I have been trying to be sober for the past two weeks but have relapsed twice already. Today I am two days sober but definitely struggling. What helps you stay sober? What are some key things to keep you strong and steady? ..I will not drink with you today!

The tips that I learned here have helped me stay sober. I especially rely on the idea of  playing the tape forward  - whenever I find myself romanticizing alcohol I remember how things unfold and end up. Also committing to one day (instead of a month/year/forever) has helped me get through well the day.  That being said I will not drink with you today!
Coming here every day to read and post has been a game-changer for me.....Also reading/watching everything I can find about addiction and recovery to better understand myself and my drinking:..The book [Alcohol Explained](http://alcoholexplained.com/about-alcohol-explained/) explains alcohol and alcoholism from a chemical physiological and psychological standpoint and is very enlightening indeed.....The book and [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4KpBxerD_BIksjUfUT4hVw/videos) *This Naked Mind* are also fantastic and helped me enormously... ..It often takes a few goes for sobriety to stick - keep trying!..I won't drink with you today ..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
The thing that kept me steady in the beginning was to have something very definite planned to do at the normal time that I would have started drinking for the day.  It kept my mind off of wanting a drink and it helped me disrupt that deeply ingrained habit of mixing a drink at the same time each day.  I either went for a walk started a cleaning chore ran errands or re\-organizing parts of the house.
These are all such great responses!!! I also recommend Allen Carr's books about quitting drinking as well as Jason Vale. And this sub.
