So I went on a ski trip and it was amazing. But the crew socializes heavily over drinking. I scrolled on here to try and maintain sobriety but I just really wanted to be with my friends and play. I faked sips until I got called out and I just... I didn't want to explain to 20+ people all at once that I'm trying to go sober especially since they commented things like  Remember when so and so when sober! Haha what a joke! ..I tried talking to someone who said they supported me but they just dismissed it as  there wasn't that much peer pressure . Nevermind people shouting "DRINK!" every few minutes during the evening. That person has also talked about their struggles with alcohol -- and they were also drinking steadily throughout the weekend. But I didn't comment about their drinking to them because I know it's a struggle? Their dismissal and "oh you" behavior felt very unsupportive of my attempts and really hurt...I spoke separately with someone else who also said they were trying to go sober but we all drank this weekend. But I didn't see it as a failure just tremendous peer pressure. Probably a cop out but I fell for it. It's hard when a whole table of people are shouting at you...I can do better. I will do better...Trying this again. I don't have a badge here but I've reset my personal counter.

I relate to you about the shaming. It sucks. In my case it was my now-former boss and I also had to fake-sip once because we were at a football game and he literally shouted  DRINK IT!  in front of other clients. I was either going to drink it fake drink it or rip his fucking head off. So I faked it until I could shove it into some else's hand. He was too drunk to notice. So drunk in fact that on Monday he was talking about how  we were all so wasted!  even though I never drank a drop. He knew my problem because I TOLD HIM multiple times and when we got to the tailgate he made me the bartender. Again we were in front of clients so I just had to smile and nod but I was infuriated. He just wanted to see if he could break me. It was only the fact that I wanted to beat him at this little game he was playing that kept me sober that night. I quit my job two days later. .It's important for me and my sobriety to surround myself with supportive people. Sometimes they say the wrong things but they NEVER pressure me to drink and usually when we hang out there's no drinking involved. I also have a good support system in someone who also has a problem (just so happens to be my brother) and we try to hold each other accountable. It's easier that he's my brother because if we fight I'm not afraid to lose him because we're related and he can't get away haha. .I think it's so messed up that so many people pressure us to drink. I personally just cut them out of my life the first time they do it (if I've been honest with them about my problem and desire to be sober). I'm sorry this happened to you because it's happened to me and probably almost all of us here. IWNDWYT.
