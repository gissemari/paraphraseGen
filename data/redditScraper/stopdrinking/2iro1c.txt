Are you willing to drive an hour or more for a good plate of barbecue? Do you eat tacos for breakfast? Have you ever referred to Halloween on 6th St. as "amateur night?" Then you probably ought to subscribe to SDAustin a little oasis for the still weird and formerly debauched in Austin TX. ..There's still one more weekend of ACL - any good shows to catch? Halloween is right around the corner - where's the party? Might the Horns stop sucking by the end of this season? OMG why am I already getting email about SXSW? Austin is abuzz these days and most weeks I struggle to keep up with it all. Let's help each other along our path of recovery while having fun IRL. Get over to /r/SDAustin subscribe and let's start talking. The meeting is yours...

Stay weird.
Man now I'm thinking of moving to central Texas and leaving /r/SDSeattle behind...

Well I *do* pull my boots on right and wear this hat so well but I guess I'll just be wistful from afar...
