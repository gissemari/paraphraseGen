Good morning/ afternoon/evening to you all! ..**Theme:** Mindfulness..         ..**Quote:**  My grandmother once told me 'Don't let failure go to your heart and don't let success go to your head.'    [Will Smith](http://imgur.com/a/wjAHO)..         ..**What it makes me think about:** Through this journey I have relapsed and struggled a lot. I understand (now) that this is a disease and that I am not a bad person.  I keep coming back though and jump back on the wagon. Like trying to eat healthy: sometimes I have fast food but I don't let that ruin the rest of my day. I accept what happened and get back on track (When you get one flat tire you don't slash the other three). Even more so when I am doing great with my sobriety - I still need to stay vigilant and mindful. Being over a month sober doesn't mean I am cured and can stop at "just one" or moderate. Just as with my diet if I have ate healthy all month doesn't mean I should award myself with a cheeseburger. ..Enjoy your weekend!

This is a brilliant quote to remind me of the importance of staying on the straight and narrow. Thank you! :-)
