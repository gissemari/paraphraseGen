this book is all around fantastic and i highly recommend it. there's a section specifically on numbing to sidestep vulnerability from low-level poor coping mechanisms to full-blown addiction. ..i thought this was an interesting analysis and that y'all might appreciate: ..> Having spent years working closely with addiction researchers and clinicians I had guessed that the primary driver of numbing would be our struggles with worthiness and shame: We numb the pain that comes from feeling inadequate and "less than." But that was only part of the puzzle. Anxiety and disconnection also emerged as drivers of numbing in addition to shame. As i'll explain the most powerful need for numbing seems to come from combinations of all three--shame anxiety and disconnection. ..>The anxiety described by the research participants appeared by to be fueled by uncertainty overwhelming and competing demands on our time and (one of the big surprises) social discomfort. Disconnection was tougher to nail down. I thought about using the term *depression* rather than *disconnection* but as I recoded the data that's not what I heard. I instead heard a range of experiences that encompassed depression but also included loneliness isolation disengagement and emptiness...>Again what was really powerful for me personally and professionally was seeing the strong pattern of shame threading through the experiences of anxiety and/or disconnection. The most accurate answers to the question about what drives numbing sound more like the answers to "What's your sign?" *Anxiety with shame rising. Disconnection with shame rising. Anxiety and disconnection with shame rising.*..> Shame enters for those of us who experience anxiety because not only are we feeling fearful out of control and incapable of managing our increasingly demanding lives but eventually our anxiety is compounded and made unbearable by our belief that if we were just smarter stronger or better we'd be able to handle everything. Numbing here becomes a way to take the edge off both instability and inadequacy. ..> With disconnection it's a similar story. We may have a couple of hundred friends on Facebook plus a slew of colleagues real-life friends and neighbors but we feel alone and unseen. Because we are hardwired for connection disconnection always creates pain. Feeling disconnected can be a normal part of life and relationships but when coupled with the shame of believing we're disconnected because we're not worthy of connection it creates a pain that we want to numb. ..> One step beyond disconnection is isolation which presents real danger. Jean Baker Miller and Irene Stiver relational-cultural theorists from the Stone Center at Wellesley College have eloquently captured the extremity of isolation. They write "We believe that the most terrifying and destructive feeling that a person can experience is psychological isolation. This is not the same as being alone. It is a feeling that one is locked out of the possibility of human connection and of being powerless to change the situation. In the extreme psychological isolation can lead to a sense of hopelessness and desperation. People will do almost anything to escape this combination of condemned isolation and powerlessness." ..> The part of this definition that is critical to understanding shame is the sentence "People will do almost anything to escape this combination of condemned isolation and powerlessness." Shame often leads to desperation. And reactions to this desperate need to escape from isolation and fear can run the gamut from numbing to addition depression self-injury eating disorders bullying violence and suicide...the book goes into details about how to work through this and the importance of vulnerability in terms of creativity productivity and positive relationships. highly recommend!!! it has been an enlightening read in early sobriety and a nice complement to recovery work. .
