Thank you to all of you for your help and kind words over the last year. This is the first place I came when I started to think I had a problem. You guys are the reason I went to AA for the first time and you're the people who keep me sober. Some days I forget to be grateful for how much my life has changed over the past year and that's something I can't ever forget. For anyone just starting out or coming back from a relapse just keep trying one day at a time or one hour at a time whatever it takes. You'll get this! I won't drink with you today!
