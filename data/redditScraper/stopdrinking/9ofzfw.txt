Well here I am again. I want to do this so badly. To stop drinking for good. I just can't seem to make it stick. In the morning I tell myself I'm not going to drink today. Then by evening I just don't care anymore and I do it anyway. Next morning wake up hate myself and the cycle begins again... I've gained 15 pounds in the last year and of course it's due to alcohol and poor food choices while drinking. I just crave that period of time where I can just shut my brain off and truly relax..I wish my brain wasn't wired this way. ..I envy those who literally don't care to drink or can be fine with just one drink. When I hear friends or co-workers joke about alcoholics/alcoholism I laugh along on the outside but inside I'm thinking to myself "if you only knew the real me and what a struggle this is...." I'm embarrassed that I've myself get to this place. This place that feels hopeless.

Feeling hopeless sucks. I've stopped feeling envious of other people's drinking though because I know at least for me it's just not an option. I get absolutely nothing out of drinking one beer so I may as well drink nothing 
make a plan for quitting. ..Consider an outpatient program..Talk to your doctor..Join a fellowship like AA ..These steps will give you the tools to get sober. Very few people get sober without some kind of support.
