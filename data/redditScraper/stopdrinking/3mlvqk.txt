Starting tomorrow I can say that I haven't been drunk for an entire year. In fact it was only one occasion that I drank less than a small bottle of beer. As many others stated here in similar threads this thought seemed so far away from me when I started...I could talk about the money I have saved (a lot jeez look at my bank account) the books I finally read and bought (with that money!) the travels I went on the friends I made (who accepted me for what I am) the work I did (and mostly enjoyed) the help I offered and the help I received (this is a huge nod to you dear SD...All of these things are very important to me and finally can take more space in my life without alcohol. Space that is not filled nursing hangovers regretting what I did the night before anxiety induced by depressive thoughts money lost and money ill spent on toxic stuff false friends...It's impossible to fit everything in here that gave me this kind of insight but I want to talk briefly talk about where it took me and where  I am right now. Being sober I have shifted between being proud of myself and total loss of self esteem when looking at my former life the trouble it caused me and most difficultly the people I had to face now. Explain myself to. Maybe even argue with...On many occasions these feelings dragged me down and I chose to go in hiding don't address my non-drinking among (drinking) people and stay alone with my thoughts. With my new extra time and power I worked up the courage to see a therapist at my university. It's free and he is a cool guy. He listened and gave me advice saying that both medication and psychotherapy could help me out. I knew the upsides of therapy from brief experience when I was younger but I was still unsure where I was at. Later in our sessions I came clean about how my mother turned to drinking when my father cheated on her leaving myself in a pretty much dysfunctional home at the time I was graduating from high school. With this info he referred me to the 12 step program of an adult childrens' group which brought most of the clarity I gained recently...There I learned to see my drinking as a way of coping with trauma that grabbed me tightly after I saw my mother in her darkest moments including an attempted suicide. It feels so weird (and kind of wrong) to spell this out to a bunch of anonymous people on the internet but my hope is that there are some who will understand...After getting on with the thought that there are plenty of reasons that alcohol seemed desirable as a self medication and escape from reality I once again felt empowered and anxious at the same time. What is going to happen to me? How do I deal with this kind of stuff?..One thing was going to the therapy and meetings. This brought me to the point of visiting my mother this weekend and finally breaking an almost four year long silence about what happened. As far as I know she is not drinking at the moment but that's the thing: I am also tired of wondering. Tired of thinking whether she is somewhere fucked up or in danger. All I want is to talk it through if necessary step by step and untighten this knot that I have been carrying around in my stomach...Surprisingly I could see my mother struggling with the same feelings of guilt and shame causing here a very similar knot. Even though she proposed taking it easy and writing me a letter in the upcoming days I was able to see part of why she was suffering. She is most likely afraid of being a bad mother having caused me trouble and distress. The moment I realized I calmly pointed out that she is doing the very thing if we keep up the taboo and not talk about anything. I want to overcome this crushing shame and guilt because nobody of us can change what happened...Now I have no idea what will happen exactly. I am glad that I worked up the courage to talk to her. In the same vein I have opened up to my roommate and another good friend which were both more than loving and supportive. I was afraid of them abandoning me...Now I have to work agains the guilt that should have been doing this a long time ago. Inside I know that I simply coulnd't because I was both lacking a clear mind and a strong support system. Right now it seems like both is coming my way. The latter might be in the form of a real psychotherapy because after setting all this emotions free I start feeling anxious and overwhelmed again. I have to take good care of myself once again...Thank you for reading yet another long and rambling account I owe you.
