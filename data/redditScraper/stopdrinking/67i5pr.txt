After a huge wake up call and drinking almost everyday for 5 years I've finally made the choice to stop drinking. I haven't had a drink in 3 days and decided to attend an AA meeting today.  I was terrified but I'm glad I went.  I'm not a spiritual person at all (atheist actually) but it was a great experience hearing of other people's struggles and triumphs.  I'm going back tomorrow.

Good for you!  I hope you'll grab a badge and stick around here too :) 
I'm agnostic but find the program to have an awful lot to offer. ..I had a sponsor did the steps. Did not find God. But I use those in the program to inspire my recovery. ..Welcome.

High five. Keep coming back.
High Five! I am trying AA for the first month myself. I have found an agnostic meeting I love a few regular ones that were awful and a handful that I got something out of either it be phone numbers or stories that I found helpful
Welcome! I needed AA and Celebrate Recovery to stay stopped. Glad you're here.
I identify with a lot of what I hear at meetings and leave the God stuff to others. I've had a great run of sobriety going to meetings that I couldn't put together without it. Made some friends too.  
I don't have a formal version of God by AA has been a godsend for me.
