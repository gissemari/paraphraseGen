I'm excited to say I've got six months this week.  I was reading this thread on the front page:.http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/16dlvk/what_secret_are_you_keeping_that_is_ruining_your/.and the OP is struggling with the drink.  After I sent him a private message it reminded me of this subreddit. ..I just wanted to come back and say thank you for the information and hope when I was hurting.  You guys gave me some of the courage I needed to come clean to my family...I know there are mixed views on AA here but I've been going every day since July.  I don't believe in god but regardless just being in the meeting and seeing people in my situation succeed (and fail) is a huge reminder of what I'm up against...Happy to be sober :)

Congratulations dude! Important thing about AA is that its not necessarily "God" but a belief in a higher power then yourself. That can be just about anything you need it to be! 
Congrats on six months. That's a great accomplishment...Glad to see AA is working out for you. I went every day many days more than one meeting early in sobriety. I don't believe in God either but my "god" my higher power was the "group of drunks" in the meeting rooms. They were more powerful than me and were able to stay sober where I was not...Again congrats. Glad you are sober today.
Good for you. Keep coming no matter what you believe!
Fair play to you. I subscribe to askreddit and often wonder if the OP's have a issue with drink.  It's funny how drink can have an impact on everything in our life. I use AA as well and it works for me as well. Keep coming back! 
Nice work congrats! Guessing you feel a lot better than you did six months ago...
