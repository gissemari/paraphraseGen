Yes I'll try.  I'm not always good at this.  But I'm working on it.
Funny that you posted this today.  Last night I was watching the first episode of [Derek](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2616280/) and the message was kindness.  "Kindness is magic. It's more important to be kind than clever or good looking."  I love that so much.  Today when I was practicing my lovingkindness meditation I went through "May I be safe....may I be happy...may I be peaceful...." and most times I would say "may I be loved".  Today I said out loud to myself "I would rather be kind than be loved" and followed up with "may I be kind".  May we all practice kindness in abundance today.  The world would surely be a better place if we did.  
This is a quote that once I internalized it- it made me such a kinder person. The true core of this quote is empathy and something that everyone needs a hearty spoonful of.
This is such an important concept.  I *try* to remember this when my husband is grunchy I say a little prayer for him.  That prayer might be offset by other less kind thoughts that immediately precede it.  But I try.
