Hi all. Long story short I'm in Los Angeles stuck here on a probation transfer stemming from a DUI I picked up in another state while I was on my way to move out here. It's been incredibly problematic trying to coordinate all three moving parts between the two states. The person I moved out here to be with my brother and I have decided that living together is not a realistic option at this point (more my choice than his he's a controlling dick)  and he is overseas on deployment  so I've been living in a military veteran center that is basically a homeless shelter for the last three months. ..I've turned down a few jobs in sales because I'm trying to pivot away from my former career as I hated it and it lead to additional drinking and I almost landed a dream job but I didn't make the final cut. So now I'm basically just going to meetings and group therapy sessions at the local VA and around town and boredom and anxiety seem to have a very strong hold on me as I keep relapsing. I don't do stupid things or go on benders or anything but it's still something I want out of my life as it leads to further self loathing sunken financial costs and depression. For example because I decided not to drive last week when relapsing I took a Lyft home and left my car in the lot. Someone decided to smash my passenger side windows in and do a snatch and grab of my backpack which had my computer and many important documents. So I'm out a backpack computer and two windows which I've since already replaced. ..It literally makes NO sense to keep doing what I'm doing. Everything negative in my life whether it be financial physical mental or legal issues has been a direct result of drinking. I've ended up out here in a gross part of an overcrowded state I don't know living amongst some very sketchy and disgusting people and somehow I keep doing this stupid shit. Ihate myself every time the next day. I hate how I feel. I hate how I look. My lizard brain quickly forgets though and I end up drinking to escape. But there is no escape from the shit storm I've created so I have to get my life back in track and IWNDWYT.

You already know that alcohol has to be gone to get your life back on track. You have a lot going on I am not seasoned so all I know to tell you is do not put alcohol in your body and take one day at a time starting with baby steps. I know you already know this but we are here to listen. IWNDWYT
The biggest thing i see here (besides the drinking) is the work thing.  For me I have hated a lot of jobs in my life but i was always an alcoholic as well.  A sober person when confronted with a job they don't like will use there free time and look for more opportunities as they continue to work.  A drunk like me just gives up and drinks away any chance of moving away from the job i don't like.  So i guess i am saying don't be afraid to accept a job you don't like just go in intending to use it as a stepping stone (but its your own life do what you want of course).  It is 100 times easier to get another job when you already have a job.
