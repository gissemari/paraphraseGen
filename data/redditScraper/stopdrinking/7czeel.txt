I lost everything very recently booze Coke pills and sex took my job the love of my life my home and my money in a matter of 2 weeks. It was coming for a long time and my lover hating me was the thing hardest to bear. ..I'm currently 30 days clean I wear the promise rings we gave each other round my neck to remind me of what I've lost...I'm sleeping on sofas and losing a really close friend didn't cause me to relapse. My friends found me a job my friends have clothed and fed me my friends held my head while I cried and my friends wrapped their arms round me while I shivered and moaned my way through withdrawal...I'm doing better now and I'm scared to fuck. I have money in my pocket soon. My ex won't acknowledge I exist I'm finding a place to stay. I'm not sure what I have to live for clean though. High pressure job free accessible cash. I'm terrified the road up from the bottom leads back to addiction...

Congrats on the thirty days. ..To me your post hints at one big thing to live clean for your friends. They sound amazing. They've supported you this far and I'm sure they'll keep supporting you.
Alcohol can't be responsible for when I'm doing good or when I'm doing bad . I have to take responsibility for my life .Ive learned this the hard way .When I blame alcohol for all the bad and expect  it to go away just because I quit drinking  I end up disappointed when life isn't perfect and use it as a excuse to drink . Life has its troubles and isn't always easy  I chose not to drink because it's a vicious circle that adds nothing to my life but misery . I hope you find your way and happiness.
I built it alll back and more.  I got support to do it!..Meetings were great!
