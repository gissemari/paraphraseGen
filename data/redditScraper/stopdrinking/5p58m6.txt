I've been going strong for coming up on 2 weeks.  I've been tempted but have stayed the course and have very much enjoyed getting restful sleep and feeling good every morning!   Thanks SD for all that you do!..Tonight  my wife and I have plans to meet a group of people at a comedy club for a birthday party/night out.  I will not drink  but the thought is making me a bit anxious.  ..Being fully sober in this type of environment will be a new experience for me but I feel confident that I can muscle through and even have a good time while I'm at it.  It will be tough but feeling good Tomorrow is worth struggling with the temptation tonight...So yes  I will not be drinking today.  Just need to put that in writing I guess :)

I hope you have a fantastic time out with your friends! I know the first night I hung out with others while sober was a huge stress for me. ..I've found having drinks like an Arnold Palmer or San Pellegrino help a lot. I have something in my hand that is more than just an typical soda helps me relax and bit feel "different". ..Have a great evening I won't be drinking with you!
