TL/DR: Random reflections here people no need to read :)..It feels like the last few days have flown by I guess because I was busy with school and work and finally from tomorrow I'll get to slow down a bit...I'm so happy to be on this journey with you people. I often feel so alone and just want to weep as the negative emotions coming back up in the last few days - memories regrets slights taken and given - and though I haven't really felt like a drink sometimes I can feel the anxious-crazy-monkey me start to take control inside here rattling my cage a bit. ..I worry about this because my life is not very demanding to be honest. I have a lot of existential angst but otherwise I'm not starving facing an illness etc. So the fact that I'm getting rattled shooting up and down inside my mind makes me worry about the future. How will I cope when I'm a husband? Father? Yikes.....But as you wonderful people keep reminding me: I don't have to drink just for today. Phew...The day itself was a bit blah. Lots of work feeling crappy from poor diet realising I've put a lot of weight back on feeling overwhelmed by just the sheer amount of STUFF one has to do in this life. ..I missed my meditation yesterday and today though - correlation? ..I was freaking out a few hours ago as I tend to do when I have a deadline. I prayed to the universe just to help me get through those hours. Some portion of peace was given and I got all my work done. Wierd! ..Thinking more about the need to fill myself with other things and that the failure to do so will end in relapse. So what things? I don't even really know the man beneath the alcohol soaked me yet. I haven't really met him very often. I don't know what he likes! Haha finding out should be fun. ..Also: the role of a crappy alcohol affected brain in making some really bad life choices has been shown to me again and again. Thank you sober brain for not being an idiot. ..I have so much love for everyone on this forum right now. I pray I can stay open to your experiences and wisdom... Thanks for reading if you got this far. Good night and sleep tight.

I'm glad you're here and I hope tomorrow is better for you! It is overwhelming frequently. Stay strong friend!
Congrats on 2 weeks! Even though your lifestyle may not be very demanding I feel that it's normal to feel like something is rattling our cage in the beginning. For pete's sake mine's still rattling lol!! It's a pleasure to share this journey with you :) Sweet dreams!
