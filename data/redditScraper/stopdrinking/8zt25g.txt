Coming up to 2 weeks sober. This is the first time I've been sober for this long straight in perhaps 5 years. I've managed a week a handful of times before but always relapsed in a major way into a tough bender. But this time I feel different...For one thing I feel more conscious about my sobriety physically and most importantly mentally. Last time I went out drinking with friends I realized they are going somewhere in their lives; achieving things. And I'm stuck treading the waters in my alcoholism. I vividly remember looking around sitting at the table with my drink thinking "this is no way to live a life." I've repeated it to myself several times when I've had trouble with cravings. Drinking is no way to live my life...Additionally for the first time I actually feel I can do this. Previous attempts have all had this gloomy feeling to it; that I'm going to break and drink again. But now every time I come out of the shops with my bread and milk and zero alcohol I think to myself "I can do this." It's a soothing feeling...I have to however kick it to next gear regarding discipline. Last time I made a post about being a sober for a week someone commented about how the new and shiny benefits of sobriety have settled in becoming a part of everyday life but the comfort of daily routines have yet to kick in. This rings so true. My days have no routine. I fall asleep whenever and wake up whenever. I eat randomly. I feel like I have to learn how to eat breakfast lunch and dinner again. Discipline is going to be difficult because my life hasn't featured any of it in 5 years...But nonetheless I am happy to be where I am. And as Samwise said "one more step and I'll be the furthest I've ever been." I'll take that another step and not drink with you today.
