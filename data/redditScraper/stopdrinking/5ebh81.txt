This is the longest I've been sober in about 15 or so years. I still don't feel fantastic. It's been a struggle. Bit I've gone through hospitalization isolation a job loss a breakup and my brothers death. I still feel lazy and Seni depressed. I'm just getting it all out there. Thank you. I am proud of myself ( kind of)

You should be proud of yourself 71 days is a fantastic achievement. It's impossible to fix life's problems overnight but things do slowly get better. 
Nice! Great job on 71 days. I feel pretty similar been depressed especially since daylight savings started and sometimes cravings are rough but I've also been through a lot in the past 3 months and I'm proud I've done it sober :) It sounds like it's been a rough couple of months for you it's great that you've stayed sober through it all 
Thank you
Thank you
