I'm stressed. I just want to sit in comfortable silence with someone who understands what this can be like when it was a crutch for so long...I hate reaching out. And I won't cave. Shit just sucks sometimes man.

Shit does suck sometimes. Thanks.
We gotcha buddy. Having a tough day here myself. It gets better.
I agree. It does suck sometimes. For me it will suck a lot worse if I start drinking again. It always always happens that way.
I feel the exact same way.
I have a good friend Mark who says--write it down and share it.  You just did that.  Good for you.  
Bravo for two years! It sounds like you could use more support. A therapist and AA helped me get through tough times.
I'm with you! It's sometimes hard to be a human 
Yeah I know that feeling. I'm about a week from two years sober and I've wondered a few times if I jumped the gun in deciding never to drink again. But take it or leave it you can't regret it. No regrets. Just saying it out loud helps. No fucking regrets. Puts a smile on my face every time. And I know this is the right decision for me.
