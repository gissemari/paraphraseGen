http://imgur.com/rSfR9IW..Thought this fit well here.  Enjoy the holiday today ... I will not drink with all of you today...Rock bottom isn't an end point it's a starting point and you can only go up from there.  Anyone struggling...everyday is a new opportunity to start over.  Today can be the day.  ...For this day will NEVER come again...
