Every relapse is worse than before. Every song every street is telling me "hey dude remember when you were all fucked up and spend all your money in beer and cocaine? I was awesome. Let's do it again."..6 days and I want a drink. It's not that I'm depressed or anxious. I'm just bored. I feel like my life is just gonna be like this all the time. In a cubicle being bored to death. Thinking that I need a beer to make it excited to make it worth something. Fuck maybe I'm really depressed.

I felt that way at first.  The thing is that you find out how much more there is to do when you aren't f'd up.  I have been shocked to find out how much I limited myself for over a decade by drinking everyday.  Stay strong it gets easier!  I wish you the best.
