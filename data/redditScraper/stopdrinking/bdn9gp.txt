 ..Let's go back to the early months of July 2018 at the time I was 20 years old. Up until this point Id say my life had been going pretty good apart from a few other things but I was able to deal with those. It all started shortly after my ex broke up with me and I found out she was in love with someone else for quite some time I might add. Long story short she started talking to this  friend  24/7 out of nowhere. I trusted her so I really don't question anything. Eventually a few things led me to question this though. Anyways I ended up being right but that's not what this post is about so let me continue.  ..I admit I have struggled with control since my first time drinking which was sometime in high school around grade 10. I was never the type of person who would just drink every day and I could go weeks to months without drinking. For this reason I never really considered myself an alcoholic. Although when I did drink it was really heavy. I have no filter and can't tell when I've had enough. I constantly get this craving to get drunker as I feel like I can never get drunk enough. To this day I still feel like the first time I got drunk was the drunkest Id ever been. ..Now let's go back to early July. This is when I really started drinking constantly. I had no job at the time so I had time to get drunk all day everyday. Sometimes even staying up the entire night drinking just to get a few hours of sleep then continue drinking. I was easily clearing 500ml of hard alcohol at this point and that's on the low end. Chuck in a few beers here and there. I also picked up smoking again at this point and was finishing a pack a day easily. ..Fast forward a few weeks. I ended up getting a job and was working 8-12 hour days. This got my mind off a lot of things and restricted the amount of alcohol I could drink. Although I was 20 so I was going out to the bar a lot with my friends. This led my body to being completely exhausted from late nights out drinking to excess then waking up for 12 hour shifts. This stage lasted for about a month. Still haven't really felt any major withdrawal symptoms. ..It's now around mid August and Im on my way to a different country. I had planned this trip a year prior. I get off the plane and immediately start drinking (alcohol here was very cheap). The duration of this trip was 2 weeks. Now this is where It really started to get out of hand. I don't know the exact amount I was drinking but it was more than anything ever before. There wasn't a single day of this trip I wasn't wasted. I think I pushed my body to its limits. I would be drinking excessively during the days then going out and getting blackout drunk at nights. At this point I didn't think I was doing anything wrong. I remember waking up on the day before our last day and going out to get breakfast. The entire time my hands were shaking aggressively and I thought to myself wow I have never been this hungover before. I continue out the day not drinking and everything got much worse. I think at one point I was hearing stuff at night when lying down in my bed. All around just felt extremely terrible. I remember extreme feelings of anxiety. I got hot flashes my head started pounding and I was extremely dehydrated. I really wasn't looking forward to the travel back. ..It was a 14 hour plane ride with a 5 hour layover then another 5 hour plane ride. Now I was still booze free since that last day of the trip. I think you could imagine how this travel time went. I really felt as if my body was giving out on itself as I had never felt like this from alcohol before. I guess I had also never really gone on a 14 day binge that bad before thought lol. Finally we get back to home turf and I was completely exhausted and feeling like a mess. All i could think about at this point was going home and getting better. ..I can't remember how long it took me to feel  normal  again but this was by far one of the worst feelings I've had in my life yet. It took me some time to realize what I had actually done to my body and how bad it really was. To this day I still somewhat find myself questioning if a 14 day bender could have been that dangerous and that maybe I was just over exaggerating my feelings due to anxiety. ..In your guys honest opinions do you really think that my 14 days of excessive drinking could have had potentially dangerous withdrawal effects.  Along with Id like to know if anyone has ever gone through anything similar to this before.

yes it can. if you are constantly drinking and especially not eating you can enter into withdrawal. which includes shaking and disorientation on a spectrum of severity.
Yeah.  I mean people can get alcohol poisoning and die in one night right.  Which I am so grateful I did not experience myself and I'm here talking about this stuff today.  Be careful out there friend.  I won't be drinking with you.
