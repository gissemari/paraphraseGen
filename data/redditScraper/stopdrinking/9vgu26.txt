Really tough month. School is becoming difficult to manage. Scratched my cornea. Struggling to find a roommate and cannot afford my place otherwise. My grandmother is dying. I think my sister may have relapsed with heroin. I have no friends. I suspect everything in my life is too much for my boyfriend to want to stick around and he's falling out of love with me. After months in constant pain I was diagnosed with an incurable condition by a medical specialist. I run out of medical insurance soon. I have had two panic attacks in the past month and I fear I may have another at any time. I'm trying so hard to keep my head above water financially. I feel so fuckin alone. ..I desperately just want one beer. But I know it'd turn into 6 or 7. And I'd spoil my five months.

The storm always passes over the mountain top my friend.
Please don't give up.  I've had a hard couple months too.
That's a lot on your plate.  I'm convinced that not drinking makes us stronger so we can face our problems with courage and resolve.  Good luck with everything..
Sending a prayer for you.  I hope something you need comes through for you to help you out.  I won't drink with you.
