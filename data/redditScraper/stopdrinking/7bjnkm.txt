[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy Hump Day! What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** A few years ago my alcohol-related anxiety was so bad that I could no longer drive a car. Now I drive just fine. In fact this past week I drove my mother from upstate New York down to Tampa. When I was a drinker doing this trip would have been unthinkable but now that I am sober not only did I do it efficiently and safely but we had a lot of fun. We found a lovely waterfront restaurant near the train station in Virginia and watched people fishing on the Occoquan River while we had our lunch. Then we got on the auto train into a couchette and I was able to take the top bunk because I didn't have to worry about a drunken fall during the night...**Struggle:** I love to travel but all the packing and unpacking is *a lot* of work...**General:**  At the center of your being you have the answer; you know who you are and you know what you want.

Wow cool talking of driving and anxiety... My last panic attack was a few months ago after I first stopped drinking -- I was in a cab going across the Bay Bridge and stuck in traffic. (It wasn't the bridge but the claustrophobia/trapped feeling). Since then I was nervous to take little trips. ..But last Sunday I didn't think much of it when a friend suggested dinner across the Golden Gate Bridge. For a moment there was a flicker of hesitation but there and back I didn't even think of it at all! I realized later I'd had a **success** and didn't even realize it at the time!..Truly that anxiety stuff is one of the biggest reasons to not take a drink. yee-ikessss!
Lovely description of your trip and I love the quote too...Triumph: Last night I came through a craving by lighting a candle and sitting with it.  Sure enough up came a lot of tears so I allowed myself to just sit and sob.  Then later I had a browse thought SD...Struggle: loads of work on at the moment and I feel the need to rest up.  But at least I get to work from home today so I will be heading out with the dogs.  The sun is shining the leaves are falling and crunchy underfoot...General: life is changing at break-neck pace at the moment and with support I am managing OK.  In fact better than OK given that I am not drinking.  Thank you again to this sub and all who sail in her..
Triumph: 14 days!!!.Struggle: Watching Alzheimers rob my wonderful Dad of his very being daily and trying to support my devoted mum through this  ..General: I am more patient kind productive helpful practical and much nicer when I'm not drinking.
10 months without alcohol as of today and closing up on a year without amphetamine...I was not feeling good at all around this time last year things were real horrible...But im starting to crave it more lately. Im in a shitty situation with my job and have some nasty issues with my back. Starting to see the signs of depression creeping up on me. I dont want to see anyone outside of the people at the gym the last thing l want to do is celebrate christmas. ..Earlier in my sobriety l didnt have any problem at all with people drinking in the same room as me or next to me l quit right?..Im not feeling comfortable with that anymore it bothers me. Ive always been the dipshit who got the most drunk at every gathering and im fucking sick of telling people l dont drink and even getting fucking liquor poured up in my glass or drinks handed to me having to remind people l quit. This is on my SO's side of the family which isnt as easy l am far from being comfortable telling them l dont drink because l am an alcoholic it'd stir up alot of shit...Im getting the dreams more and more frequently and more of this feeling where Theres like a mini panic attack coupled with this almost surreal feeling when l get a Sudden urge or crave...Im fucking struggling right now but there is no way lm giving in. I fucking want to cry right now. Sorry about the rant.
Triumph: I didn't let my ex-boyfriend into my home this morning when he showed up at 6.30am banging on my door smashed off his face &amp; expecting me to rescue you him!!! Just yesterday he said how proud he was of me for being alcohol free &amp; he wouldn't do anything to jeopardise that! Today I proudly protected my sobriety &amp; my self esteem!!! This is a **huge** NDV!..Struggle: Letting go of feelings of guilt &amp; remorse for not letting him in..... *What if he got hurt etc*. Also checking in on myself to make sure I don't start beating myself up for believing once again that he might really have changed this time.... as well as trying to be kind to my very fragile heart!..General: I think that this quote was posted just for me today thank you /u/sfgirlmary :) I am delighted that you had fun on your trip with your mother &amp; well done for driving so far!
Triumph: Slowly but surely i'm turning my life into what i want it to be. I'm dieting and changing my body and always giving myself something to look forward to. Being ill at ease in my own body and having nothing to do always was a trigger so i'm working to squash those feelings completely...Struggle: Lately i've been worried about relapse. It's not a concrete possibility and i haven't had cravings for days but i realized in my mind when i picture going thru a tragic event (you know how brains are- see a car crash in tv picture your family being hurt in a crash etc) i always picture myself relapsing. I only noticed it lately and it's been nagging at me...General: I really can't make heads or tails of the whole banking thing. I've been trying to connect my bank account to paypal and it just ain't working and i keep being bounced from side to side while being forced to use notoriously not so trustworthy paypal as a wallet. Makes me want to punch a wall to be honest.
Triumph: Today will be my 5th straight day of counting calories and staying on track. I wasn't able to while I was drinking and when I first stopped drinking I could only focus on not drinking. This feels like a big triumph to me because I can finally feel the control alcohol had on me start to lose grip. I have a long way to go but this is a valuable step for me. ..Struggle: I'm currently stuck at my job and I'm going to have to wait at least another month before I can get a better one. .."You either suffer the pain of discipline or you suffer the pain of regret." - Jim Rohn
**Triumph:** I've been accepted onto an entrenpreur's development programme which starts later this week. That wouldn't have been possible stinking of beer.....**Struggle:** I've over-committed financially which is causing a few negative thought patterns to emerge which has knocked my enthusiasm a bit. ..**General:** "My actions are my only true belongings" ~ Thich Nhat Hanh
Great to read about your trip. I feel empowered and am excited to be taking this sober journey. I know there are challenges ahead but I welcome them and will embrace adversity. The feeling I get when I think about my sober future is one of excitement. I'm in love with my wife my kids and they are better for knowing the sober me. I will not drink with you today but I sure enjoyed that brief look into your life thank you. 
Glad you and Mom had a good trip down! My most recent driving issue was hitting a pothole on the f'ing Cross Bronx and cracking the windshield :/. Hey could've been worse...**Triumph:**    I've become a solid rock for K. I take care of the house spend lots of quality time with his Mom and chat with his sister frequently. He told me how much he loves coming home to a warm house filled with love and happiness. This could *only* happen *without* alcohol ;)...**Struggle:**    Mom's energy and strength are diminishing; I can clearly see it. She gets tired more easily now doesn't have the same zest sis says she's depressed. But here's another **Triumph**: I decorated the entire inside of the house with her favorite Christmas lights and garland it looks so pretty and cheered her up a bit ;). I know it's early for Christmas but if it makes her happy then so be it!..**GENERAL:**    Is this 'fall back' time change BS throwing anyone else off schedule?! Dammmmmmmmm.... :/...
Triumph: I got 499 problems but a drink ain't one! I'm about to reach the next goal post I had set for myself and that feels pretty awesome :)..Struggle: I'm  kind of getting overwhelmed by work stuff right now. I need to get up to speed on some things for a new project but my brain finds it so boring and I've been dragging my feet on doing the research I need to do...General: Meditation has become a great addition to my nightly routine. I kind of thought all the answers would just come to me when I started doing it. Turns out relaxing the body and mind can be a lot of work ha ha but it's pretty cool when it happens.
**Triumph**:  I got so much done during a weeks' vacation that I am just really proud of..**Struggle**:  Latest relapse was really bad.  Decided that I could "handle it" and "rewarded" myself ended up blacking out for I don't know how long.  That never happened much before and it scared the absolute shit out of me.  Done done done..**General**:  Feeling in general melancholy and down for the last few days.  I'm not sure if it's just the weather changes stresses of a new position at work or what.  This is the time of year that my depression usually dips... My staycation showed I really miss being a housewife but the freedom of having my own money to spend and contribute is too great.
What a beautiful story of appreciating everyday moments ... thanks for sharing. ..Triumph: Thanks for reminding me how much better my anxiety is without drinking. It was really really bad at the end and that was the main thing that drove me to finally quit completely. ..Struggle: Wow all of a sudden there are so many things I want to do ways I want to spend my time that I am really enthusiastic about. These are not brand new things that have mysteriously emerged out of the universe. They were there all the time but I couldn't summon any enthusiasm the past few years. Now there are more things I want to do than I have time for. How to prioritize and/or find more time? Good problem to have. ..General: Maybe I should ponder today's quote to find the answer :-)
**Triumph:** I generally feel fantastic! My weight is going down I feel healthier both physically and mentally and work has been going fairly well as of late...**Struggle:** I really want to ask out my coworker at my other job but I'm not sure if it's the best thing to do. We work super well together and I feel like we click. As much as I don't want to mess that up I haven't felt this strongly about someone in a long time and I'm tired of pushing my feeling for women aside. I'm glad I'm not drinking to distract myself from it...**General:** My family's coming out for Thanksgiving this year; I can't wait!
Good morning Mary! Are you parked in FLA now for the winter too or do you go later?..**Triumph:** First conversation negotiating the divorce agreement with my SO last night. Started with what I think will be the hardest and worked it through. More to come on Thursday but this was a big hurdle...**Struggle:** That I'm the one who seems to have to figure all this out or at least guide the process to do so.  I'm linear pragmatic and pretty damn clear.  He on the other hand goes "blank" when things are emotionally hard for him and doesn't know how to plan for processes.  Part of why we're divorcing I guess...**General:** I applied for a job yesterday in a town a long way from where I live but much closer to my son.  It happened in a really random way (saw it on CL for a town in a different city and state) but it's a position I'm highly qualified for and would be very interested in.  Beam good juju my way please for the universe to guide me to my place of best service!!
Triumph: 195 days without drinking and for almost all of that time almost every moment I've felt confident and in control absolutely certain I do not want to go back to drinking. It's been a great six months overall - even in the most difficult moments I sometimes was tempted to smoke but never even thought of drinking other than in a clinical dispassionate way (eg  before this would have made me run to the store for a twelve pack ) or sometimes will have nostalgia for it by can easily overcome that.  I've also quit smoking and really begin to transform my life BUT....Struggle:  I really fucked things up the last few years. I am struggling almost every day with the aftermath of bad decisions and neglect and I worry constantly about the future. I still have a hard time facing my problems and perhaps have found other ways to avoid them and put them out of my mind. I know it can be bad to worry too much but avoidance can be bad too. Overall I have been very happy and at peace but then I have to deal with something that threatens to shatter it. While trying to create this new richer life it is even more difficult to have to sift through the broken pieces of the old one but I have to for work reasons. And sometimes I almost wish I were drinking ONLY so that I would have something to fix and focus entirely on so I could go back to the point where it was best to say  I have to concentrate on sobriety and absolutely none of the other problems matter right now because this is life or death.   I kind of miss THAT. Jesus. Sorry this is long!  
**Triumph:** Instead of reacting I'm choosing to act. I'm far from successful all the time but so much more effective when I can pause and make that choice...**Struggle:** After making decent progress on several huge work projects I've stalled out again. I'm trying not to let it drag me down. ..In my first thirty years of life  .I roamed hundreds and thousands of miles.  .Walked by rivers through deep green grass  .Entered cities of boiling red dust.  .Tried drugs but couldn't make Immortal;  .Read books and wrote poems on history.  .Today I'm back at Cold Mountain:  .I'll sleep by the creek and purify my ears.  .*From  "Riprap and Cold Mountain Poems" by Gary Snyder*
Triumph: today is a week of sobriety and I'm feeling great. I'm glad I found this sub and other people bettering themselves. It gives me hope. ..Struggle: I got a DUI on Halloween and that's when I decided to quit drinking. It's been straining me financially but I'm working through it. Thank you all for the support. 
Your trip sounds just wonderful.  What quality time with your mother!..**Triumph:**  Making it through a stressful and expensive electrical system replacement at my home. I hate not knowing if I'm being taken advantage of as a woman since it's outside of my knowledge base plus MONEY!  But the good news is that I haven't once thought about drinking to deal with it...**Struggle:**  The usual frustration with myself that I'm not doing anything to find a better job for myself.  But I have opened up some more free time for potential volunteer work that could open doors for me.  ..**General:**  Having to work from the coffee shop today and loving it.  Wish I could do this every day!
**Triumph:** I don't find myself reading through the posts on SD as obsessively as I used to or checking in with my own posts but I love these opportunities to stop and reflect. I guess this is my triumph today. On my commute this morning I finished one podcast and the next one that came on was an ep of a sobriety podcast I listen to when I'm feeling on the verge of relapse. As I was listening to it I realized I haven't even thought about my sobriety or alcohol in a while. It just hasn't been a problem for me which is such a huge and welcome change that I never thought would happen. I've been very busy with work including at night when I would normally be watching TV and thinking about wine. And it just hit me that I'm really really happy right now despite all the things happening that used to make me majorly stressed out. It's because I'm dealing with that stress by dealing with things instead of dealing with stress by drinking.. .**Struggle:** I'm defending my dissertation next month and I'm worried about it. Rationally I know that at this point the dissertation is what it is and I'm confident in my work and the defense is a chance for me to discuss that work with smart amazing people. But I just have no idea what to expect and I keep torturing myself with worst case scenarios. Gotta stop that. ..**General:** Will spend the lunch hour reflecting on that lovely quote sfgirl! Thanks for that and for running this thread!
**Triumph:** this past weekend my wife and I celebrated our 26th anniversary.  Last year I got so drunk that by the time dinner was being served at a fancy restaurant in SF I was in the toilet getting sick (pretty much no food all day and waaaay too many IPAs).  So we decided to go back to the city and the same restaurant this year so I could have a sober do over.  The whole day went really well and afterwards my wife (who was successful moderating her drinks) said she felt more at peace and also closer to me than she had in years.  So beyond staying sober for almost 3 months this was BY FAR my biggest triumph to date!..**Struggle:** Daylight savings time means that it's dark and cold when I get home from work so my normal routine of immediately going for a 1 to 2 hour long bike ride becomes much more of a mental challenge (this is the time of year when I would typically just blow it off and start drinking)...**General:** I really that Lao Tzu quote. So much more difficult to get centered when inebriated/hungover all the time.
Triumph: I have made it to 65 days of sobriety and today marks my first week of being a non-smoker! I'm using a vape right now and this is the longest I've willingly gone without a cigarette in 22 years so I think that's pretty fantastic. I'm already feeling better overall and I can suddenly smell things again! ..Struggle: I work two jobs and both have been stressful this week. I'm getting ready to go meet my father for the first time in my life next Tuesday so that has been kicking my already considerable anxiety levels up a few notches. ..General: I am really starting to appreciate how great my partner is. We haven't been together for very long (only about 4 months) but this is the healthiest and most fulfilling relationship I've ever been a part of. We can actually talk to each other which I'm not used to. It's a wonderful feeling!
Triumph: I had an excellent interview today at a facility that not only impressed me but has a very high level of professional standards. The way they were talking I'm nearly positive I have the job...Struggle: I've gotten back in touch with my higher power and I've consequently learned how much resentment and anxiety have come to define me. Now the real struggle begins to surmount this but the true struggle is that it's not a struggle at all. I just have to let go...General: I asked my husband to cover part of my shift for me today in case I got back late from the interview. I got back in time but he told me to take a nap for one or two hours because he knows I had to get up early and I'm tired from the drive. I love him!
**T:**  Dealing with a family emergency without alcohol...**S:**  Dealing with a family emergency...**G:**  I've really had to kind of take a step back and things have gotten pretty crazy.  
* **Triumph**: back from my trip (which was a dry win mind you!) and just rolled back into the routines I've been establishing these past weeks. Easy-peachy...* **Struggle**: it seems every loved one around me is suffering. Mostly mental/emotional partly physical. Pulls you back from saying "I feel *so* good I have *so* much energy." ..* **General**: Christmas! Christmas! Christmas!
Triumph: The music video I was a part of was FINALLY released (see my post history if yah wanna watch it)..Struggle: I have to do my dishes in 20 minutes and I am not even dressed...General: Bacon grease makes my eggs 20x better.
**Triumph:** Had a total blast on a 4 day weekend trip.  Dance party long walks great food out thrift store shopping.  I never missed drinking.  Also I barely vaped.  I'm getting ready to step my nicotine level to zero and be free of that addiction...**Struggle:** The shift in season where I am means it gets dark at about 5 pm.  It's been rough and I have not been getting evening walks.  I know depression will kick in with a quickness if I don't figure out how to join a gym or something.  I'm already starting to go crazy...**General:** The center of my being often feels like the center of an everlasting gobstopper.  There seem to be so many layers in the way.
