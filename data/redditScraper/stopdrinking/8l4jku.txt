I've got my first sober date coming up next friday and notmally this would be where I relapse. The thought striked my mind but I have been upfront about my sobriety and that I will not drink...I've been pretty low lately and feeling like I'm missing out on all sorts of fun. It was recently the national day and this is a big nationwide party which I did not celebrate for the first time in 10 years. Also my best friend is getting married and I had to turn down the bachelor party because of obvious reasons...Then out of nowhere this girl from work texts me and asks if I want to join her for drinks next weekend. The funny thing is that I've been crushing pretty hard on her and planning to ask her out when I quit in the summer. And then she beat me to it ..IWNDWYT or next Friday ..

You're joining her for drinks?  Any way to suggest another place to go on your date?
