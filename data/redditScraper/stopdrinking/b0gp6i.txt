So strange. I never had many of those very early recovery dreams people post about here where they have had a drink and wake up grateful etc. ..But I just remembered that I had a dream a few nights ago that I'd totally forgotten in which I was deep in a protracted few weeks of relapse. I remember knowing I was there and watching it happen for some time. ..Humbling as fuck to think that even well after 2 years I spent this same amount of time x maybe 8 (!) either drinking regularly or slightly less regularly having life-threatening and extremely destructive binges.

The power of alcohol....wow! .I had my first  drunk' dream today. Very unsettling. Thank you for posting - Something I need to watch for even as I move forward. IWNDWYT
