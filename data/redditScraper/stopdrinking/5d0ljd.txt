I binge drank nightly to treat my depression and anxiety. I went through an outpatient rehab program this spring and started anti-depression meds and have been sober since.  Life seemed like it was getting easier: the cravings were rare and I could deal with problems without wanting to drink...The last couple weeks have seen us have to give our dog away (to a good family at least) and the presidential election triggered large amounts of depression and anxiety in me. It was worse for my wife who was in an extremely dark depression and flipped out on me when I told her I was having cravings. She had thought that was I done with that but has since started going to Al-Anon meetings and is doing better.  ..I feel up and down. Sometimes fine sometimes massively depressed. I've had some of that all fall but this been more severe. Most frightening to me is the sudden images of liquor or me drinking liquor that sometimes flash through my mind. I confided this in my wife and my group therapy (the followup to my rehab program). I have never gotten much from AA but I'm trying to go to some more meetings...Mostly I just feel alone and very tired so tired that I feel like I am on the verge of relapsing. I'm not sure what I want from posting this but thank you for listening.  It's evening here and I can make it the rest of tonight without drinking.

I did inpatient rehab therapy and found that if I just sought out people to hang out with and was patient people would end up seeking *me* out. I dealt with a lot of guilt and shame and extremely low self esteem because of it and it was a lovely awakening.
This is exactly one of the great support aspects of meetings.  ..Sometimes it *takes time* to get something from the fellowship.  The more I participate the more I receive.  What you just shared in this post would be a wonderful share at a meeting...Early on I heard something by someone with *many* years of sobriety it was in response to a new person asking "how many meetings do I need to go to?"  He replied "I only need to go to **one** meeting; I just don't know which one it is".
