I'm happy to say I'm still with you guys as always you're detailed personal and even passive support has influenced me greatly and I encourage any lurkers out there to share any thoughts they may have and know that if any of you are struggling with the process I will not be drinking with you today...I know I wouldn't be in a position as positive with booze still in it...Much love...It's year
