All the best!
In the same boat. I won't drink with you today.
I had many relapses. One time it just took!..Don't ever quit trying. Don't. Ever. Quit...Not drinking with you today!
What's going to be different this time?  If you keep trying to quit and it doesn't stick what changes can you make? 
I know what that feels like.  I've tried at least 10 times over the last 2 years to quit.  You can do it! 
Keep up the fight!!!  You can do this!
Just focus on making it through today.  If you're going to stay sober today I'll stay sober with you.
