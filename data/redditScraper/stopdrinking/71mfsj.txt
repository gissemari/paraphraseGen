https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGCcLWU0OVo..So I know it is always a bad choice to compare one man's suffering to another's. However in this case it has woken up so many memories in me. I know this is the second time I post a song in a language that isn't as universal as English but I feel like the video captures so many emotions we feel as we try to get better. I have to admit I fell off the wagon one day ago. But that will not discourage me. In the time leading up to it I had more sober days than I had in years... I will not drink with you today.

&gt; I have to admit I fell off the wagon one day ago. But that will not discourage me...I'm most impressed with people who get right back on the wagon after a relapse. My last relapse lasted about a year. When I fall off the wagon I don't come back. :( It motivates me to reject the first drink...-reverse("stopdrinking")
