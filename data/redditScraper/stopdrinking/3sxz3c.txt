Hey folks how's it hanging? Some of you might know that I recently got a new job and for those of you that don't know this means that I get weekends off now for the first time in years. Honestly i don't care so much about going out and doing all kinds of crazy shit I'm just happy to have a consistent schedule with the same days off every week. ..This weekend is my second one not working and it also as luck would have it was my good friends going away party. He is one of my friends that went sober before I did and has been someone that I could hang out without worrying about the pressure of getting wasted however all of our friends are very big drinkers. Now over the past ten months of sobriety I've been very much a home body and I haven't seen a lot of these people in a long time what with not having any good nights off to see them and not wanting to go to bars when I do have nights off... There were a handful of people there that were not  drinking myself and my friend included luckily there was a shelf of La Croix in the fridge but a good chunk of the people were shit housed and it wasn't pretty. These were people that I thought had their lives together when I was still drinking. I looked up to them and now I could barely keep up polite conversation with them. It was a great insight into what life was like for me this is what I looked like... I always read posts on here about how people want to quit drinking but they don't want to lose all their friends and I totally get that but that's not what's happening. It's not this huge dramatic breakup with your friends you just change slowly and one day you wake up and you realize that you're not on the same page as these people. Guess what that's totally fine. They can do whatever they want it's not my life and I'm no person to judge other people for their behavior. I did the same shit for over a decade probably worse. So I said farewell to my friend who was getting assaulted by drunk "don't leave me's" all over the place and told him I wish him the very best. Then I just kind of said good bye to that group its not really for me anymore. I hope I can keep in touch with them but hanging out is just not my idea of a good time anymore. I'm glad everyone made it home safe and I hope this long winded rant can at least help someone who is struggling with friendship in early sobriety. As always thanks SD.

Great post. Spot on about friendships in my experience. Some endure and some naturally expire. Nothing tragic in that.
