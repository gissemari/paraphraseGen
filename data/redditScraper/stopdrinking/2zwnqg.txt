Jaysus I hope he gets the help he needs as well.  I don't think I have heard of anyone doing that kind of thing before.  Thanks for posting.

Guy has no regrets:..The treatment program   how did that get set up?.I called them....If you were able to call and get into the program without much of a problem I suppose that means you might have been able to avoid reporting yourself to police if you'd wanted to..Too late now....What do you hope comes out of all this?.That I get the help I need.
Incomprehensible demoralization. He didn't know what else to do so he took action. ..I hope he gets help and makes it to the other side.
