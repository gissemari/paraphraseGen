I spent the better part of a year struggling to get sober and I always enjoyed reading all the ways peoples lives improved with sobriety so here is my list...1. I am on my 65th day of sobriety and I have lost about 20 pounds without making any other major changes to my lifestyle...2. I have saved about 500 dollars by not buying a ton of booze these past couple of months not to mention money saved by not making careless drunken purchases. I actually have money in the bank at the end of each pay period...3. I have energy again. I am once again taking an interest in some of my old hobbies I no longer spend all my time being either drunk or hungover...4. I am far more productive at work...5. My overall health has improved less frequent trips to the bathroom every day and my heartburn that plagued me is the same as gone...6. I have tackled several minor repairs around the house that I had been avoiding for over a year...7. I enjoy mornings again and actually get to see morning on the weekends...8. I haven't said anything stupid that I regret in over 2 months..The list could really go on and on but the point is there are a ton of benefits to getting sober and this list just covers a few. To anyone out there still struggling you can do this start making your own list today.

9. Inspiring other to be awesome. 
Way to go - and ditto on #9. Thanks  
This post is great! I've discovered all these benefits as well! And to think I really tried to talk myself out of quitting for so long before I made the leap. Congrats on your success!
Hey fellow 65 day'er - this is a great list! 
Great list! All the small things add up to something really big.
I can relate to pretty much all of these in one way so far. IWNDWYT.
