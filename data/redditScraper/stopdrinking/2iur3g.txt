Last night was pretty shitty. I have still not drank a drop nor have I had the impulse to do so. The last time I felt the urge or desire to drink was Tuesday. I keep telling my self that the problems with my relationship are going to get better now that both of us are sober and abstaining from the drink. However the fallout of the last incident has certainly rattled both of us at the core...Now old man cpujerk has to sit down and explain a few things about why I am here and why I started drinking again after 8 years of being normal from a previous shitshow of boozing. My lady has a serious problem with booze she is taking antabuse and it worked for the last 10 months. Up until August things were ok with us until I got consumed in work gaming and just trying to make my self happy. I did not give her the attention she needed. She had relations with an ex of hers and the whole incident really broke me. We stayed together worked it out and we moved to our new place in my home town. We were still not happy and after about 2 weeks of settling in she had been late for getting her vivitrol shot - (she started this sometime after she had been taking antabuse because she would cheek the antabuse and find ways to acquire). ..We started drinking together to try to open up a little bit to each other and try working things out. Well that worked out ok for about a couple of days but then we ended up drinking 1-3 large or regular sized bottles of wine every night or every other night. She started slipping back into her old ways and I found my self at my wits end 5 days ago because I knew I had enabled her and broke my self at the same time. Shame does not even describe how I feel about this I single handedly managed to put our life house hold and everything at risk under the assumption that drinking could have solved something...Now as things stand shes mad at me. She is refusing to get the vivitrol shot - which i can not exactly blame her that shit leaves her feeling really shitty for days sometimes a week. However she has not wanted to seek out any sort of help yet like I have with AA or even talking to people about her fears worries etc. It worries me that she will certainly relapse again as she has in the past. She claims she is going to seek psychiatric help via a local place - but I am still on the fence as to the validity of the that claim...At the end of the day I know that I have a desire to quit drinking and free my self from the thirst and live my life to my oldest age. My sons are growing up and they need me to be the best man that I can be. It makes me happy to have them in my life if need be I can raise my youngest with out her if it has to come to that - but I pray to god (even as a godless redditor) that she will find the way and our family will stay together. Until then I am going to drink earl grey tea play a few hours of terraria on stream with my kiddo and keep kicking alcoholism's ass.
