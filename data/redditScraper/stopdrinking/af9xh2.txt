This sub has been an integral part of my ability to stay sober. The support is overwhelming and has gotten me through many hard times. Every day I check in here and read encouragements and struggles of people with a similar goal. I wouldn't be on the brink of 30 full days without you all. Thank you!!!

Wow! Look at all those days stack up!
This sub has been my substitute for rehab or meetings. I'm a very private person so it's just a better fit for me especially when I'm struggling...I've had relapses but just coming here seems to allow me to relax and back off when the temptation hits. Even when it hits hard. 
36 days here. congratulations we'll keep on fighting. This place is sooooo helpful I check every day also. IWNDWYT or tomorrow.
Thank you. Not being hungover makes life much more enjoyable. Keep it up.  We're all in the same boat.
Beautiful job congrats!
Right with ya!!
