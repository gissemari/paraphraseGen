[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy Hump Day! What's Up Wednesdays are when we celebrate our sobriety see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** I am no longer walking with a cane! I got a foot wound around the time I quit drinking (it was coincidental -- the wound had nothing to do with booze) and I have been dealing with it ever since. I still have to take it easy but every night after dinner I take a stroll around the neighborhood. It's so great to be active again even if only moderately...**Struggle:** I am trying to prepare my taxes which always means me dragging out a box of receipts and then feeling overwhelmed. Every year I swear that the next year I will not have a huge mess again and then the next year rolls around . . . ...**General:** I don't actually have a TV (people are always asking me  What are you Amish? ) but I have been watching comedies on my laptop -- most recently binge-watching the show  Superstore  and stand-up routines by Kevin Hart or Jim Gaffigan. I think laughter is so good for both the body and the soul...What makes *you* laugh?..
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph:  out of town on business and passed up on an opportunity for "dinner and drinks" and instead met up with my favorite aunt for a relaxing meal and evening.  That's something I never would have done if I was still drinking. I would have have had way too much to drink stumbled into bed barely slept and been hungover for my meeting tomorrow. ..Struggle:  74 days in and still having a hard time getting to sleep. Averaging like 4 hours a night is really tough..General:  I'm in a fancy hotel with complimentary breakfast and coffee to wake up to.  I got paid today which is nice but not drinking anymore is worth at least a thousand or two annually.  It's like I gave myself a nice little raise with no commitment to anyone except being a little kinder to myself. ..What makes me laugh?  I was reminded today what an amazing person my aunt is.  I don't see her much because she lives in a different state but she's a pleasure to be with and we shared quite a few laughs.  So glad my sobriety is offering me opportunities to reconnect with the people I love. ..I will not drink with you all today!..
Triumph: This is the longest I've ever gone without drinking since age 15 and I'm seriously honestly enjoying it. I'm cranky as hell and had the shakes super bad for a few days but I'm fine now. (The badge is wrong I started my journey 03/16/2017 correction submitted)...Struggle: Performing without the sauce is still a fierce battle. It's worth it though for cognizance and simply REMEMBERING my shows. Sleeping is a bitch too...General: The girlfriend and I are reconnecting passion is creeping back into our relationship and I find myself enjoying spending time with her. Today we did a bunch of human tasks and I found myself leading the charge. Now I'm tapping into music work for a while as she sleeps. It's nice.
Triumph: I was avoiding a lot of things I needed to get done so I was causing a lot of unnecessary anxiety. I am happy to report I finally did it! Such a weight off my shoulders! Why do I torture myself with procrastination?! something to work on but I definitely feel a triumph for getting a lot of important things done...Struggle: My friends and family are giving me a hard time for not coming around as much anymore. I am going through a low period right now after my initial pink sober clouds have worn off. I don't want to go to social gatherings or really anything passed 4 o clock/ the afternoon. People are getting offended. And I am just over here trying to survive and stay sober!..General: In general things are actually still pretty darn good. Every sober day (even my worst) beat any day hungover. I am so grateful I am sticking with this...Laugh: The two Dave Chapelle stand ups that just came out on Netflix are phenomenal! I had no idea how great his stand up is. It is nothing like his character roles from the Chapelle Show. He just tells really funny stories about his life... Good on you for not being tied down to the tube. Sometimes I can be  I can get really sucked in. In my drinking days I spent so many days bed ridden from hangover and anxiety that I watched so much TV. Now I get to enjoy TV like a normal person for just a couple hours a day as an unwinding treat...Love whats up Wednesday! Hope you all have a great hump day.
T:  Getting shit done.  State says I owe back pay for child support.  And I'm the custodial parent.   So I was dealing with that today.  The triumph was that I dealt with it.  The situation isn't resolved but I didn't ignore it...S:  School is not going well.  I'm really struggling.   I'm in real danger of failing this semester and that makes me frustrated and angry.  But instead of focusing on those emotions  I will recognize them and focus my attention on studying. ..G:  My daughter makes me laugh.  She can definitely piss me off too!  Like when her and her friend think it's a great idea to throw mud at my back porch!  
**Triumph:** A group of students I'm mentoring won a local enterprise competition and now progress to a regional event...**Struggle:** Procrastination.....**General:** My kids make me laugh
Triumph: Finally feeling a genuine commitment to being sober. .Struggle: Coming out of my haze and coming to grips with all the shitty behavior I excused over the years. Having trouble sleeping..General: I am packing and moving this week which is stressful and exciting at the same time. Normally I would use taking off from work as a chance to binge drink but instead I am using it as a motivator to stay sober and get things done. 
Slowly getting back to normal after a binge on Saturday night. I feel fine but my emotions are still kind of out of line. Also smoked a bunch of cigarettes which I normally only do when drunk. That's thrown my sleep off but I'm getting better. I'm committed though and have come to some realizations. I want to be my best self so I'm going to eat healthy and exercise. I'm excited because I'm getting Kingdom Hearts tomorrow and I can't wait to sit at home and play it with my younger brothers while we eat snacks and drink milk tea! That game was our childhood and I can't wait to revisit all the old worlds.
**Triumph**: I have not drank since Sunday and drank less than normal on Friday/Saturday...**Struggle**: My work's end of year party is this Friday and I am supposed to have drinks with coworkers tonight at the wine bar. What's more next week I had scheduled a drinking session with my company's board members on Monday night and I feel like they will be disappointed if I don't drink because all of them have been looking forward to it for the last 2-3 weeks...I question if I jumped into sobriety wholeheartedly or at a bad time. It may have been more tactically sound to wait until after this period of drinking sessions passed (I am new management and the end of year party was supposed to be hosted in part to welcome me etc.)... but how much of that is real? How much could it be that I am making excuses for myself? Have I really established that I have a problem? ..In my head I keep drinking when I am better off not by comparing myself to others. I've only really fucked up and stayed out all night drinking on five or six occasions over the last year but I have overslept for work more times than I can count (conveniently I have no boss so I keep lying and saying I had a customer meeting in the AM)...**General** .Recently got into playing Overwatch. Great distraction! Except when my team is full of scrub Hanzo mains. Then I want a beer -- not to drink -- just need a bottle to crack some skulls with.
**Triumph**: 5 weeks without alcohol! It went much more quickly than I thought it would...**Struggle**: I'm really not exercising as much as I should. January and February went really well with lots of walking hiking and climbing tors but then the rain came and knocked me off-pace and now I'm struggling just with going outside every day. I don't want to just stop drinking I want a healthy strong body too!..**General**: I'm trying to get into podcasts again I have so many bookmarked but never get round to listening to them. Starting with "Terrible thanks for asking". It comforts me...Dark humour makes me laugh- the type of comedy that pokes fun at the bleak realities of life and commiserates with you over the ugly bits. 
**Triumph** I expressed concern and unhappiness (2 different issues) to my SO with kindness respect and gratitude. Drunk me would have picked a fight and complained about not being heard. Sober me waited for a reasonable opportunity and was heard. ..**Struggle** Managing worry and fear as my daughter's seizures are more frequent despite medication dosage increases. ..**General** My family makes me laugh almost daily. I am fortunate. I also laughed out loud watching Trevor Noah's recent comedy special on Netflix. So good. 
Hope you have a good flight today u/sfgirlmary!..Triumph:     I got my friend with the hip replacement out of a funk and got together with our group to have a surprise get-well/Happy Birthday lunch tomorrow. Making someone happy? Priceless...Struggle:     It turns out that I need to attend a weekend course in South Carolina. I'm fine with the trip but I'm feeling frustrated because I wanted the course and certification to be completed by now. One of my not-so-good qualities is impatience. Looks like I need to work on that!..General:     When I first got sober I drank a ton of coffee. Then iced tea. Then herbal tea. Now I'm absolutely hooked on water with fresh lemon slices. Just weird how I always need to have a beverage in my hand ;). Oh and GUM. Lots of sugarless bubble gum!
*Triumph:* My manager has started the process of getting my contract renewed for another year. He put it out there that nothing is guaranteed because of 'stuff' beyond his control but said they better renew it because he wouldn't know what to do without me. I'm taking that as a win and keeping my fingers crossed :) ..*Struggle:* Twice now my husband has made comments along the lines of my not drinking is because he won't let me. When he said it this weekend I think it pushed me closer to drinking than I have been in months just to prove how much 'control' he has over me. I told him not to say that ever again and he responded that it was just a joke. I've been stewing on it non stop now just the thought of it makes me so mad. I know drinking to spite him would only hurt me and I need to move past these thoughts I'm not sure how to do that though...*General:* I'm currently catching up on Season 2 of Better Call Saul before the new season begins. Not so much a comedy but that Slipping Jimmy definitely gives me a good laugh. 
**Triumph**: Walked down my usual street of bars and didn't walk into one. Bought groceries I got some healthy stuff!..**Struggle**: Can't sleep tonight. Still consumed with some rough thoughts of the past couple weeks. It's almost 5 am and I keep thinking about walking around in the rain outside I'm antsy...**General**: Going out with some friends on Friday for coffee should be fun. Re-watched all of BoJack Horseman the past couple days. Depressing at times but a very good show.
Triumph:  Lost my wedding ring on Friday (stupid non drinking weight loss!)  found it on Monday.  ..Struggle:  The wife and I had a big talk about saving money and our plan so last night she decides to go to the bar after work. and spend $30.  It's not a huge amount but it shows to me she isn't taking this serious.  ..General:  A lot of stuff makes me laugh.  I avoid watching anything serious.  Everything I watch is comedies or cartoons.  I've recently been binging on the show Room 101 a British panel show about annoying things.  The host is a recovering alcoholic  and is super open about it and usually has some fun anecdotes about it. 
**Triumph:**  Managed to pluck up the courage to ring the landlord and negotiate new rent for the year. Things are never as hard as you think they'll be. Except maybe fighting a tiger...I think that'd be pretty rough. ..**Struggle:**  I'm so tired. Always exhausted and can't seem to wake up in the morning. I think it's my body re calibrating but we'll see. I could just be lazy. ..**General:** Laughter comes easy these days. *Real* laughter not forced situational (as in I need to be liked!) laughter. You tube fails are even funnier now I'm sober. ..
**Triumph:** (I hope) I think my food cravings have finally settled down. While drinking I would never eat and lost weight. When I quit I joined a gym but I gained weight primarily because my body wanted all the food I'd been denying it. All of the food! But now I'm not craving something every 20 minutes...**Struggle:** Now to get that weight off... or replace with muscle...**General:** Looking into "cutting the cord" and getting rid of satellite service to go streaming connecting the TV directly to the wifi. The satellite dies literally every time a soft breeze blows so this is probably a good thing and will save money.
**Triumph:** I'm putting the bows and ribbons on a very big work project . I was asked to take lead on the next phase and offered the resources to do it well. I'm nervous scared and very excited. If I kept drinking I was headed towards disciplinary action instead of project management...**Struggle:** Balance. One of the goals of SMART Recovery is "living a balanced life.  Skiing and trailrunning are a series of connected falls. Yoga is finding balance in no matter where you are. I have to take those physical practices and bring them into my mental and emotional state...**Laughing:** The flow state brings me great joy enough that I will sometimes laugh out loud. Absurdity makes me laugh so I tend to things like "IT Crowd" or satire.
Triumph: Made it 4 weeks sober! Even while the spouse was out of town all weekend I managed to make it through without drinking...Struggle: We're getting ready to make a big move to another part of the country - it's going to be a real challenge this time around...General: We've been binge watching the new season of 'Grace and Frankie' - that show makes us laugh so hard!
Triumph: I've been to a meeting everyday and sometimes twice a day. I also got myself a part time job at at bakery!  This is great as I haven't been working for the past 5 months. I am looking forward to starting next week...Struggle: Still having a really difficult time sleeping. I am hopeful this will lesson as I start working since I'll be on my feet for a decent amount of time...General:  I'm going grocery shopping for the 1st time in months today. Planning to get healthier foods and start cooking again..What makes you laugh?.Hearing others laugh makes me laugh! ..
New to this but I plan on this being day one. Reading everyone's posts very inspiring.
**Triumph:** I don't really count days any more so I was pleasantly surprised to see my badge here today at 1404... I never thought it would be possible for me...**Struggle:** Yesterday was 7 months since I got hit by a car and I still haven't recovered from the concussion. It's been a slow and tedious recovery...**General:** My dog likes to sleep on his back and when he gets in a deep sleep his tongue hangs out of the side of his mouth. The sight of this big dog on the couch with all 4 paws in the air and his tongue hanging out makes me laugh every time.
**Triumph:** I haven't drank for two weeks! This is a pretty big deal for me. I've also been spring cleaning. I actually have the energy and focus to do it and it feels really good...**Struggle:** I'm working out some major goals for the future but it's going to take some hard work on my part and getting my ducks in a row before they can happen. I hope I'm able to accomplish what I need to...**General:** I've been binge-watching Shameless. I can't stop obsessively watching episode after episode and I'm going to be fiending for more soon because I'm ready to start season seven. Aaaah noooo!..P.S. - Thanks for reminding me I still need to get my city taxes done. Ugh. This weekend then.
**Triumph**: Creating a plan to tackle my inertia. Feels good...**Struggle**: really focusing on myself right now and making sure I am okay so I am not being very attentive to my family...**General**: I actually didn't have a TV for many years. Two years ago I was outvoted by the family and we have a TV now but we don't have cable. I like to watch Korean shows and a couple of variety/game shows really make me laugh: Infinite Challenge and Running Man.
Triumph:  Two Wednesdays ago my triumph was that I had gone 12 days without alcohol exceeding my then-goal of one week. My struggle was that I caved before getting to 13. It was a sad Wednesday for me. BUT NOW something has shifted. I'm not in this for a week or a month or three months or a year. There's no finish line. Only today; only *every* today. And on *this* today I best my previous SD Personal Best.  ..Struggle:  Well right this very second a supposedly napping baby is awake and wants to play with Nana so my struggle is that I gotta cut this post short! Ok bye!  ..Edit: and Dave Chapelle's new special on Netflix makes me laugh.
**Triumph:** I didn't drink last night. It was the roughest craving I've had thus far. ..**Struggle:** I feel emotionally exhausted and wish I could take a vacation from my entire self. ..**General:** A friend and I found a super cheap group on to a local spa. I am so looking forward to sitting in a sauna and going through the mineral baths. Yessss...hey sfgirlmary congrats on being able to walk around cane-less! i'm sure that's a relief. ..i just finished through season five of VEEP which took me a little bit to get into but as it went on was making me lose it. it's hilarious! and horrible! and hilarious! 
Hurray to being able to walk cane free.  That rocks!..**Triumph:**  7 months!  I celebrated with a slice of grasshopper cheesecake from an awesome bakery last night and went on a walk through a beautiful park.  ..**Struggle:**  I am really feeling the lack of sunshine in the Pacific Northwest. It feels like Spring is delayed this year.  The constant rain and cool temperatures make my favorite hobbies of gardening and construction projects difficult.  I am struggling to be patient for longer days and better weather...**General:** Hanging out with my friends often makes me laugh.  I have some people in my life with fantastic senses of humor.  I need to spend some more time with them.  .
**Triumph:** I did really well in an interview yesterday. it feels amazing to feel like a trusted authority who knows her stuff...**Struggle:** I've been so lethargic lately - and I think it's actually a physical imbalance of some kind. hormones iron I have no idea. gotta see a doc. in the meantime it's hard to peel myself off the floor and get anything done. ..**General:** Jim Carrey clips and bloopers on YouTube make me laugh my ass off. every time! 
Triumph: So many triumphs in the last 10 days but the one that stands out the most is that I now sleep 7+ hours every night and wake up feeling refreshed now that I'm not passing out drunk anymore. It effects everything! I'm in a good mood most of the time now the brain fog is gone and I have more patience with my kids. And I go to the gym 3 days a week after I drop the kids off at school rather than going back to bed to sleep off my hangover...Struggle: Tonight will be my first test since quitting drinking. Hubby has to work late the next few nights. Two weeks ago I would have been ecstatic that he was working late so I could get drunk without him bugging me about it. I'll have to find something else to keep me occupied at night. ..General: Sobriety seems to be getting easier with each passing day. At first the thoughts of not being able to drink and my sober future consumed most of my days but now it's getting to be less and less of a thing. I don't fear the future of not being able to drink as much. I'm reading "This Naked Mind" and it's been so helpful. 
Triump: I found a way to pay my student loans off more efficiently which is something I would never have focused on when drinking...Struggle: I work at a bar normally until bar close but tonight I get off at 10pm and the policy is you get a free drink after work and I know it will be hard to resist joining them for a round but I know that round will turn into all night...General: Still knew to sobriety so I'm just dealing with that and going about life trying to find better things to do...What makes me laugh: Currently it's the show "The League" I've been binge watching it and it is hilarious!..Anyways thanks for the support everyone I will not be drinking with you today!
