Just checking in to say "Hi" and "happy belated Christmas ya'll!" I can't believe how easy it was for me to not even feel remotely tempted to drink this year.  The previous 2 or 3 holiday seasons I was recently sober and struggled with all the time off and nothing to do around the holidays.  But this year with all this sobriety under my belt I found it easy to be present and enjoy the time with family without the "aid" of alcohol.  It just gets easier and easier as time goes on.  For those just starting:  HOLD IN THERE!  It gets better!

This is amazing. I want to be here. I've had days like these in my attempts so far but today is rough. Thank you for posting. 
"The quiet ease" - I love that description. Happy for you!
This is something I'd like to try for in 2019 thanks for the inspiration!
