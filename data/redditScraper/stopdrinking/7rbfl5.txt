Hi. I need some advice. I've decided to give up drinking and while I'm having little to no difficulty with not drinking alcohol I am having trouble controlling my emotions. I haven't cried in a very long time but lately I can't seem to hold it together. Very small things are setting me off. I woke up in tears this morning and I'm sitting in my car on my lunch break and I can't stop crying long enough to go back inside. I made an appointment with a therapist but can't be seen until the end of February...I should mention I have a great support system. My partner and family know I've struggled with alcohol and are behind me 100%. But I'm afraid of unraveling. Is this normal? Any advice is appreciated.

This is totally normal. You should look up post acute withdraw syndrome or P.A.W.S. for me my emotions fluctuated for three months without any clear cause and I was severely depressed for the first month. Then I went through extreme swings for 2 months. I have finally had a consistent mood for the past month. Some of my feelings had me feeling like I was going to die but I didn't! I learned to feel them and accepted as part of the journey. Goodluck 
Totally normal! ..Feelings that get buried with alcohol use don't go away they simply get shoved into the subconscious. When you become sober they start surfacing. And they surface for the purpose of healing. :)..Meditation helped me a lot during this phase and simply allowing myself to be emotional. Fighting the emotions caused me more stress. I found it was better to ride whatever wave my emotions were giving me and when I did they passed more easily. The fact that you're experiencing this means that you're healing unresolved turmoil stuff you may not even be conscious of! :).
I don't know about you but I used alcohol to "control" my emotions for a loooooong time. I started drinking when I was a teenager... I never learned how to adult without booze. When I removed the alcohol I had to figure out how to actually cope and deal with life. That is **hard**. Early sobriety is the worst but it is temporary. ..I have found a lot of comfort in reading memoirs of others who have quit...turns out all of my "crazy" thoughts weren't so crazy. [Here's a list](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/books) of great books. [*Drinking: A Love Story*](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/73965.Drinking) by Caroline Knapp is fantastic. ..It gets better. It just takes time. Stay strong!
