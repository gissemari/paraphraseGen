Last semester I sorta melted down and hit the booze hard in a way I'd never done before. Some of my classmates knew I was struggling with health/mental health issues in the fall. Today I saw one of them for the first time since a month ago and he said:.."You look great...you're glowing!"..I almost teared up. I feel so much better and it's apparent just from a look in the mirror. Mentally and physically I feel like a human again. I hope to never revisit the dark place I was last semester. ..I don't know what the future holds but I feel like I'm on to bigger and better things. I will not drink with you today! So grateful for all the kindness and support in this community <3

Well done!! Keep up the great work!!
Nice to get some positive reinforcement and tangible results. :) Way to go!
PhD student here. Wasted months and months of time being drunk instead of doing my experiments in order to GTFO of here. So tired of the bullshit in my program and I'm not learning anything new. Just a life-suck. Congrats on pulling yourself together. The ONLY way I know I'm going to get out of here is to stay sober. Let's do this together!
Great effort. Keep it going and keep posting your updates to help us all with your inspiration!
