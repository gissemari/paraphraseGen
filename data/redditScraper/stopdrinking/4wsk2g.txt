I drank over $400 in only a few days. I got kicked out of a bar passed out afterwards and tried to return to the same bar. I feel horrible right now and I feel if I don't stay sober I will certainly die. I tapered off over several days and today is my first day without it again. I feel horrible both emotionally and physically. Can anyone relate?

I'm so sorry to hear that. Do you have any idea what triggered it and what you could do to prevent the relapse next time? Sobriety is work and hopefully you can take something away from this...And the important thing is that you're back here! That's really good to see!

Sorry that you're feeling so horrible right now. Do you know what lead up to it? ..I'm glad to see you back here - it takes a lot to get back up and you did it. Take care of yourself for the next few days try to get some rest hit some meetings go to sleep earlier. Day 1 is almost over. Tomorrow is a new day and I hope to see you back here feeling better and stronger :).
