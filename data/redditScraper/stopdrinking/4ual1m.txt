I didn't drink last night and I've made it through the day today and have to work a 24 hour shift tomorrow. So I will have made it through my first weekend without drinking on Monday in years. Just thinking about going three days straight without a cold beer is blowing my mind. .I must say you guess have been a big part of my motivation when I read your struggles and see I am not the only person fighting this battle. ..Thank you
