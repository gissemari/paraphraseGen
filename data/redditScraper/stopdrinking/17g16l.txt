I really breezed through the first few months I am not gonna lie. But at the beginning of month 5 I was really struggling and negotiating with myself. This lasted a couple of weeks. And it passed. So hang in there guys if you find yourself doing the same. ..High 5!

Thanks for sharing.  It's been mostly easy for me thus far too.  But I'm trying to leave myself open to and prepare for a time when it isn't so easy.
The same exact thing happened to me last week. The feeling has mostly passed for now. Weird coincidence I guess...Glad to know it passed for you as well.
