*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*..---..&gt;Shame cannot survive being spoken.  It cannot survive empathy. (Brune Brown's [TED talk on shame](https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability)..In sharing our struggles and victories and responding to each other with empathy this is exactly what we are doing.  She calls this "building shame resilience" but I don't care what she calls it it's the same thing:..&gt; Building shame resilience is about reaching out to others and building a connection. When we do this with people in our support systems we often develop relationships that are built on a foundation of empathy. This is incredibly important because based on this research I found that the opposite of experiencing shame is experiencing empathy. When we tell our stories or share an experience with someone and they respond with empathy most of our shame loses its power.  (Brune Brown)..*With that in mind I invite you today to not only join me in reducing our personal shame but in providing the empathy that is the antidote by responding to someone else's pledge.*..---..**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**. .I'm pledging myself to not drinking today and invite you to do the same.. .Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.. .It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours lets not drink alcohol!. .---. .**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!. .What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up.. .**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.. .**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.. .---. .This post goes up at:. .    US - Night/Early Morning  .    Europe - Morning  .    Asia and Australia - Evening/Night..A link to the current Daily Check-In post  can always be found near the top of the sidebar...---

Checking in...Was feeling really down the past week or so which is probably the first time since I've quit that I felt that way for more than a day or two. That whole confronting the realities of life thing without a psychological crutch. ...Pushed through and kept it together and came out the other side feeling amazing. It's so much  easier to deal with real shit if you can keep your head  straight. You solve the problems you can and move on (hopefully without creating new ones)...IWNDWYT. 
NO SIR NOT TODAY
Had a tempting week not too long ago. Righted myself and worked it out. Got rear ended in a car accident on Friday and that started for a rough weekend and week. No matter what I'm out cash. I've managed this far. Wouldn't even have this car if I was drinking. I'll get through this for sure. Just a bummer when the shitball gets rolling. 
Eating fruit instead of drinking it! IWNDWYT
Managed to not drink this week away skiing which is no mean feat! When they say apres-ski they don't mean coffee......one more day. However I feel great every morning and skiing the best I ever have. I won't drink today!
**IWNDWYT.**
Fuck alcohol. I will not drink with its you today!..-posted from my yoga mat-   
I will not drink with you all today...and I will also try not to eat so much candy today...ahem. 
Woke very early / very late. Stars were still out. Seem to be back in a cycle of poor sleep. But made a brew and a buttered crumpet and snuggled back in bed. IWNDWYT 
One week woohoo! Iwndwyt my friends &lt;3

Not drinking with you all today.  This sober life is worth it and continues to grow each day!  Hoping for a great day for all.
not drinking today!
Wow. I'm on 44 days. Got past 6 weeks. Now my next milestone is 9 weeks. Last night I went to a catered dinner and drank mineral water. Formerly I would have come home badly drunk after just letting the caterers constantly refill my glass. Felt really good - and I won't drink tonight. 
Checking in. Almost at the one month mark. I haven't been sober this long in 15 years. So glad I joined this community. I'm struggling but am finding support here. Thank you all. 
Heading to my job interview in a couple of hours and I am quite nervous while hoping for a positive outcome. Regardless of what will happen I vow to not drink today.
I didn't drink with you in New Zealand today or tonight. ..I need a holiday after this!
Happy Valentine's Day    I will not drink with you today :)

Hello Wednesday another sober day ahead loving waking up clear minded and free from fear of the day before. Got to keep on keeping on even though there are tough days that will challenge that. No drinking with you today. Peace
I will not drink today
Today was a tough one. I was really tempted to say screw it and check out but I stuck it out and got through. I will be a lot happier when the physical effects of not drinking finally go away. It will certainly make the choice to not drink easier. ..Anyway I'm here and I wont be drinking with you all tonight. 
Morning all. Will not be drinking today...My SO and I used to call it  Valenwines Day  and use it as an excuse to get a drunk as possible...Happy to not be partaking in this this year.

Good morning SD. I will not drink with you today.
Got a lovely email today from an old friend who recently got back in touch today they reminded me of something special I gave them all of 32 years ago! Made me smile and feel all reminiscent about positive things. Smiles are contagious even in the supermarket. I am smiling and eating very spicy Thai stir fry instead of drinking tonight. I will not drink with y'all tomorrow either :) :) :) P.S take a smile if you need one! Happy Wednesday! 
I will not drink today.

Happy Valentine's Day SD  ! I'm looking forward to a couple's counseling session tonight. Nothing says Love quite like "we're committed enough to each other to admit we need someone to referee our fights." Ah facing those issues instead of drowning them in booze...it's a relief. I won't drink with all of you today!

I won't drink today.
I will not drink today 
Inching toward 60 days. Exciting times. I will not drink today 
I look at every event in my life and level set/set my possible level of anxiety from them with this system:..**Level 1**: I have complete control of the outcome and the final decision is up to me. I am the final decision maker of the outcome.**Level 2**: I do not have complete control of the outcome but do have influence over final decision. My advise/actions could influence the final outcome.**Level 3**: I have no control of the outcome and can not influence the final outcome because if this I should not worry about it...I share that because for the next 24 hours my decision to drink is a level 1. Although my mind will tell me it's a level 3 because of (insert excuse my head comes up with); I know that when my sober head hits the pillow tonight it will be because I had control of the situation... and because of that IWNDWYT

Happy Valentines Day SD! My husband and I ordered all new couch pillows last night as our gift to each other. You can tell we've been together a long time....Wow! Are they expensive when bought all together (3 couches)! ..I'm trying to decide if I'm going to give up anything for lent this Ash Wednesday...initially I thought...I'm giving up alcohol ;) but that's cheating lol haven't drank in the last 4 months as of tomorrow!....I'll see if something strikes me at mass today. Have a good one!
900-Days.  ...I never thought I'd get to 30.  To those wondering if it gets easier I'm LIVING proof!  Keep At It!!..I will not drink TODAY no matter what happens good or bad.

I want today to be the first day I don't drink. I've been noticing lately that I usually have a drink around noon or before and just brush it off as being off work or I feel entitled for one reason or another. I have heard of this group and how it's helped others but was still sceptical. But here I am. This is my last day of alcohol and all of your stories have been amazingly inspirational so thank you. 
I will not drink today!
Not hungover but still feel like crap.  I'm determined to feel good again and it won't happen if I drink.  I will not drink today!
Happy Valentine's Day!       IWNDWYT!!
Good morning.  Not drinking today.
IWNDWYT!

Checking-in from a routine check up. I hate needles!
I will not drink with you today!  
Good Morning  I woke up happy and healthy. I will not drink with you again today. 
Good morning SD! Waiting for our new mattress delivery; we have not bought a brand new mattress well EVER because we "couldn't afford it." Uh huh. Sure. No we could afford it I just put all my/our money into nights out and Tito's vodka. My Sober Tool app says I've saved (by my guesstimate of how much money I spent on drinking every day on average) $2695 since my quit date. Jesus! I look at that and I think that's GOTTA be wrong right?? When you see it in stark numbers like that it's pretty unfathomable. ..Have a great Wednesday all and I will not drink with you today! 
not drinking today
TIL u/4db22 is very good at hosting with quotes. IWNDT! 
I was hoping that alcohol was my only problem and that stopping it would solve my problems.  That is not unsurprisingly not the case.  I used alcohol to run away and numb a lot of feelings and those feelings are now starting to come back to the surface.  It's difficult.  But regardless I will not drink with you today.
I will not drink today.
I will not drink with you today
I love Brene Brown  - I think she has great insight and her TED talks are fantastic.  I am so familiar with the feelings of shame and of being ashamed of myself and can attest to the power of using empathy not only with others but also with myself.  That is how I ended up here.  A few months ago I decided to treat myself with understanding and told myself I didn't need to feel ashamed anymore.  A few weeks later I finally stopped drinking.  I reconnected with myself by doing this and it has made all the difference.  Thanks for reminding me and for hosting /u/4db22!  I will not drink with you today. :) 
Day 124. Not drinking today.
Won't be drinking with you today!
Going to my first AA meeting tonight. Normally I'd be an anxious mess but I'm pretty excited. ..IWNDWYT

30 days! It's been a couple years since I had this many days. This time I posted my commitment each day not to drink. Not a big change but a change for me. Something must be in the water here on r/stopdrinking...I better check my La Croix.....IWNDWYT!
Day 3 had an extremely restful sleep last night.  I struggled hard to make it home without stopping for a bottle but I called a few people from my meeting until I got in touch with someone. He told me he was proud that I reached out and encouraged me and I threw on my Chopin CD in the car and turned the volume up and made it.  I will not drink with you today!
Made it past 7 days! Insomnia is still terrible but managed to get a few hours of sleep last night. IWNDWYT
Went to a basketball game and now have to reset my timer...I will not drink today!
