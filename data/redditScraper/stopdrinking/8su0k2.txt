Like the title says....I'm having a tough time today. Tomorrow night we are going to the drive in. And even tho I've made it thru things like the Super Bowl dinners out a vacation....for some reason this stupid drive in is causing me stress!!! We have to get there early so I keep thinking  how am I going to sit there for hours and not drink?? .  why can't I just have a few beers &amp; enjoy myself ??..I just went back &amp; read all my posts from the last 6 months &amp; that helped a bit. But any support would be great. I can't believe my mind would even be contemplating it so close to 6 months!!!

Hang in there you got this. We're all so proud that you made it this far and I have faith in you that you can keep going. I know the temptations are strong as i am struggling with that myself but we just have to remember what comes after the drinking. The puking the headaches the emotions money spent friends lost embarrassing moments.. it's not worth it!! ..IWNDWYT!!
Something similar came up for me too.. an art show and party.  Sounds fun a few drinks and the mingling the whole atmosphere.  I reminded myself this afternoon that  **one fun time drinking is not the way I function.**.Oh well.  I've got it made right now anyways!  IWNDWYT 
I don't think these struggles go away...ever.  So far haven't for me.  I've been avoiding a lot of triggers...like breathing.  Everything seems to trigger sometimes.  Just steel you resolve take some tunes a book a movie on your laptop try to sink into the distraction.   If somebody razzes you say your the designated driver.  Hang tough. 
Oh Kotabear we are so honoured to have made it this far let's keep it.  Remember all we went through before and all we gotta do now is **so much easier**.  Besides -  I'm greedy and I like having you here!     
You have come such a long way!!!  I hope that you are proud of your accomplishment - I admire you; 171 days is huge!!!  My only advice is to have a plan. Make a plan take your own NA drink - plenty of it - and keep it in your hot little hand!  I also file away a couple of responses to drink offers.  Also if it were me I'd have a book or something to dive into while waiting for the main event.  Good luck!!!!  IWNDWYT
