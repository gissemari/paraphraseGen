Today is day 6 for me. .Ive struggled with anxiety and depression for over half of my life..I found myself self medicating with alcohol for the greater part of a decade worsening in the last three years. .Secret cabinet sips of whiskey. Adding it to my evening tea ( because it tastes good )..Dipping my face in the freezer for a swig of tequila. Hidden empty beer cans in my closet. .Secret trips to the bar. .Excited to have the house to myself when families out of town just so I could eat shitty food and drink whatever I wanted without having to be told not to. .I can't tell you how many times I don't remember the evenings events. .Poor choices. .I once convinced my boyfriend to slap me across the face because he said I told him it would be funny. (In front of a dozen friends and i dont remember any of this). .Drinking mimosas and bloodys with brunch. Cider with lunch. Whatever was available in the evening. .You're having a shot? I want a shot!!.Waiting. Lingering. Hoping they fill my shot glass for me so I don't seem too openly eager if I say anything out loud. .Heaven forbid I leave an open wine bottle on the counter. .So...today is day 6. .What's the motivation? Learning to feel every ounce of love for myself that I can. .Learning to feel all feelings finding the strength and clarity to accept them and allow myself the space to live with them and let them go.

This resonates a lot with me. It was day 6 for me as well. Spent some time at the gym and just trying to get some things that I've been neglecting sorted out...IWNDWYT
