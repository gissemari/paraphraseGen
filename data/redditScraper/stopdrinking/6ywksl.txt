Will be 3 weeks sober tomorrow (3rd longest stretch of sobriety ever behind 5 weeks and 5.5 months). I am getting dinner with my pastor today and he told me had been praying for me because of my struggles with addiction. I felt so happy i could tell him that i had been staying strong in my sobriety. It feels good to not let other people down and most importantly not let myself down. ..Especially it being friday (the hardest fucking time to be sober especially being at college) it was a great pick-me-up. Here's to not drinking today :)
