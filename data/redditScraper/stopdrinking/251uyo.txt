Once again I will have to reset my badge..Boy I didn't just drink last night I swam..2 bottles of pinot Gris because I had a bad day at work..I'm going to have a lot of bad days. I need to deal with them..I feel like crap today after starting to realize how good I could feel..And.......I swear my liver hurts..Please send some positive energy my way..I may even try to go to a meeting tomorrow..This is just ridiculous.

Go to a meeting today!
I found it important to me to find other ways to deal with my frustrations...I went to SMART Recovery meetings (and read the literature) to learn tools to deal with issues that cause bad days in a better way.  I read books on recovery that helped make it easier.  I see a therapist (who specializes in addiction &amp; is a recovering addict herself)...I wouldn't just "may even try".  Nothing changed in my life until I made actual tangible changes...Good luck.

I recently had a stumble and felt guilty afterwards.  Didnt feel bad or guilty leading upto it i just didnt care enough.  Feeling like crap the next day both physically and mentally has been a good reason for me to care enough not to stumble again.  For me i think about drinking daily sometimes its overwhelming other times i can shrug it off.  The fact still remains that when i do drink I feel like crap afterwards and nothing is better than it was before.  Same problems different calendar date.  Delaying the inevitable of solving my problems was an illusion i chased into oblivion.  Im crawling out of the void now and being sober is the best tool so far at helping me crunch those trigger feelings and life issues.  Ive only got 2 weeks under my belt but today i feel strong enough to feel good tomorrow.  Good luck feel good for today.
