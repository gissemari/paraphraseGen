I am feeling extremely blessed to have been able to recharge today after spending this last weekend at a friend's bachelorette party. ..It was mentally and emotionally exhausting. I didn't struggle with cravings but being around booze for two and a half days straight is just no fun for a sober person! Also coming to the realization that even though I can stay sober through these situations I now know I can no longer enjoy them. It's just not my kinda party anymore literally. ..My husband was unexpectedly called out from work today so we got to go out to breakfast and take a drive through the local mountains to hike. I got to come home and Netflix binge with my pooch and my fav person. ..I will take these simple beautiful pleasures over my old partying ways any day!!! ..I am so lucky I don't have to live that life anymore. Thank you to my higher power my sobriety and my own determination to create a new fulfilling life for myself. ..I'll happily not drink with you today. .
