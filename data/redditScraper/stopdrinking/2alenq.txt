As everyone knows I've been struggling with alcohol for awhile now. I don't drink during the week anymore - but a couple times in recent memory I've been going out to the bar on a Friday or Sat. and getting drunk. Many beers and shots later I'm at home maybe cracking open a few more. Then I wake up vomit all morning and it takes me the rest of the weekend to recover. The first day or so I usually have a headache and I sleep all day. I usually have diarrhea for days after these binges (not sure what this means) Then over the next few days the depression sets in. That's where I am right now. Hopefully this depression will lift soon. It's time to stop completely. I'm going to a support group soon. And everytime I have the urge to go to the bar I'm going to call family and go have dinner with them instead or do something else. I'm almost through this and I'm tired of alcohol having it's way with me.

Hello and welcome /u/anxietythrowaway5/...&gt; I'm tired of alcohol having it's way with me. ..It's like a love affair gone bad. Alcohol turned on me and I wasn't in control anymore. You are in the same place now. Kudos for your decision to get well...Alcohol irritates the lining of the digestive system; hence the diarrhea. The depression will eventually lift. Give your body and brain time to bounce back. [Sorry if  "bounce" sounds too violent at the moment.]..A support group is an excellent idea. For me it made it easier and more fun to be sober. I wish you the best on your recovery journey.
&gt;I'm going to a support group soon. ..I have a better idea.
