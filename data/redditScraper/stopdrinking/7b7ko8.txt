I slipped up. .I'm laying here evaluating my decisions and my actions. .I was feeling great and I was on my way to something meaningful within my recovery journey..But I went to a party and it led to a two day binge with my really good friends. I had fun but I couldn't stop thinking about the issue I'm struggling with. .Every sip or conversation I had gave me the temporary relief that I was craving..I pace myself when I'm doing this..I stay composed and people have no idea I'm an alcoholic..I also make sure I'm around drunk people when I drink so I blend in with the herd. .The thing is I was making headway. .I was feeling great and getting some clarity and pause from my cycle of drinking. .But heartbreak is tough and apparently I'm weak when it comes to my resolve. .I can't be around parties or booze for at least 30 days before I try and use that kind if discipline. .I almost did it. I made it till the last group of people were there. Then I started drinking with them. .Woke up today so bummed out with myself. .I Never do anything wrong. People like to talk to me when I'm being social and I enjoy people tremendously..But I'm killing myself with these patterns. .And the whole time I'm doing these binges I'm internally conflicted and upset for making these decisions. .The suicidal ideation and negative thoughts are back..I had gotten away from those thoughts by being clear headed. I also smoke a thousand cigarettes when I drink..I'm getting to old for this shit. ...I'm posting that I slipped up so I can stay accountable..I'm starting again. .Day one. ....I'm gonna read and comment and give support. .We all need it....Iwndwyt!! .

*"apparently I'm weak when it comes to my resolve."*..You are *not* weak. What you're doing takes an incredible amount of strength and since we happen to be  human we aren't perfect. ..What I'm grateful for is that like you I came to the realization that wanted to quit drinking. After that seed was planted I wasn't able to go back to my old ways. That seed was first planted 3 years ago though so it's taken me a lot of these types of nights a lot of shame a lot of regret to get to 36 days today. But the important thing is that we're here! I will not drink with you today. 
I did too.  I hope you can go easy on yourself.  Even when I was drinking last night I was very clear that I was going to be done with drinking.  We can do this.  
I couldn't stay sober without help. Actually it was easier and more fun to do it with a therapist and AA.
