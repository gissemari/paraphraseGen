So I finally quit alcohol 19 days ago after a really shaming and embarrassing incident (ended up in the emergency room injured and was lucky to get away with that).  ..Today for the first time I had to face the same situation sober. I thought I'd be fine but as soon as I got there I had this wave of shame and I found it incredibly difficult. I was not tempted to drink but it made me remember how I've acted and I am struggling to reconcile who am I now and how I acted then. ..That was all really. Just felt very alone and ashamed by how I've embarrassed myself in the past. I hope I can move past this.

You have done something incredibly tough and brave: making the choice to get sober.  You have the victory of not drinking today... and not drinking 19 days.  That's a lot to be proud of! IWNDWYT 
The great thing about committing to sobriety is that we move further and further away from the humiliating lives we once led. I find I see my old drunk self as a person I have tremendous love and protective care for and when I see people now who remind me of my former self that's typically how I feel for them protective tender care.
