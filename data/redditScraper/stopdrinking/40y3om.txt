Since I kicked the booze on the head only 2 weeks ago my life has snowballed in so many positive ways. Somebody up there is really looking out for me! .Some days you're the dog some days you're the lamppost. .I know a lot of the posts on SD are negative and of course they are folks here are struggling to get their lives back in order. I'm not boasting I've been very lucky this year so far but I wanted to share these changes in my life as I hope that others will be inspired to stick at it..Peace and love.

I don't think a lot of the posts are negative.  I don't think that at all actually.
Congratulations!!
