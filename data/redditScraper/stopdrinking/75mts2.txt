[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy Hump Day! What's Up Wednesdays are when we celebrate our sobriety see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** Every single night when I hit the pillow sober it is a triumph. It simply never gets old...**Struggle:** I have to get an infusion for my MS every four weeks. My insurance company has decided that in order to save them money I can no longer get the infusion at a hospital near where I live in San Francisco but must travel for two hours on public transportation down the peninsula to a cheaper infusion center. *Sigh.*..**General:** I was recently watching the documentary *Heroin(e)* on Netflix which is about a town in West Virginia where people were overdosing all the time. A person at a town meeting was saying in essence that there is no hope for some of these addicts and a woman who works for the fire department said  The only qualification for getting into long-term recovery is that you have to be alive.  Meaning -- no matter how bad things have gotten as long as you are not yet dead there is still hope..
----------immediate responses--------

Wednesday is traditionally my most difficult today whenever I've tried to limit / stop drinking in the past. I feel great and empowered and totally on top of things on Monday and Tuesday and then here comes Wednesday. Which is weird as it's my happiest and most social night of the week (with a mix of nondrinkers and drinkers) and yet I always have a near overwhelming urge to drink when I get home all happy and hyped up. I will not drink this Wednesday night. 
Two weeks in and I feel anxious and overwhelmed and on edge... but I also feel a strong sense of mental and intestinal fortitude that I think I haven't had in a while. As a kid I often thought of myself as tenacious unrelenting... but over the last decade had questioned myself time and time again. I am starting to feel some of that seep back into my life and I couldn't be happier. ..I'm realizing that I was always tough enough to ask the questions but never tough enough to want to know the answer. So instead I drank until the questions I had were rendered meaningless. Until I no longer had to face my doubts and fears.  I no longer feel that way. ..Ever since I was a kid I always had a way with words and people. At a young age I learned to manipulate and for a long time I used that ability to my gain. As I got older and developed an internal moral compass I found myself doing less of that and instead being a good negotiator salesperson SME... except when I was drinking. ..These last few weeks with the strength and fortitude I've found I've observed myself using these abilities to alleviate or solve problems instead of manipulating people. I've found diplomatic ways to quell issues and conflicts with and among people. ..I still struggle daily but seeing this much of a change  in my mind in such a short period of time has been so rewarding and exciting. I know that some day the pink cloud will go away but I'm at least holding on to these feelings because I realize now that I'm capable of them. ..IWNDWYT!
Struggle: I picked up dinner from the Thai place next to the liquor store. As soon as I started walking to the car my brain started doing that thing you know... the 'other' voice. ..Triumph: I only gave the 'other' voice a few minutes before calmly but firmly shutting it down and retrieved my delicious food without incident. ..General: I've been feeling a bit hard on myself for not doing more than just not-drinking. Eating too much not spending enough time and effort on classes not waking up as early as I should. I try to remind myself I'm actually doing way better than before but it's hard to tell because I have so much more time on my hands to waste. I also know without a doubt that if staying sober is all I can do right now then it's enough. If I lose that everything goes with it. On the plus side I'm happier so much happier all the time now. 
Triumph: I started a(n admittedly very strict) diet brought new clothes am sleeping more and taking better care of myself while working very hard every day...Struggle: Food has always been a way for me to help in my sobriety. I forsee some though times as it'll take me a couple of weeks getting used to eating mostly vegetables. But you've gotta really test your willpower sometimes. It's a good thing...General: I'm still really irritated at the romanticization of alcohol and self-destructive behaviors lately. I don't just mean big billboards selling you on that "you can be who you want to be in life just have a lil drink!" but also on social media memes pop culture. It's a really insidious form of peer pressure.
**Triumph:** Still sober!..**Struggle:** A recently trapped nerve in my neck is causing pain in my neck and shoulder. There are good days and bad days today is a bad day.....**General:** Autumn is my favourite month when the wind ain't blowing...
Happy Humpday to you!..I'm sorry that the insurance company is jerking you around.  Health care in this country is a joke.  Don't get me started.  ..**Triumph:** I'm keeping a positive attitude about being pretty broke again this month and working hard to catch up financially. I'm moonlighting to keep milk and gas money coming in...**Struggle:** I'm feeling threadbare stretched thin for time every day.  I'm trying to prioritize at least one 30 minute walk per day and it is just so challenging to even do that. And I need to even more present for friends and family that are counting on me for support.  It's all piling up...**General:** I saw that documentary.  That fire chief lady was awesome.  It's inspiring how some people seem to be immune from becoming jaded and callous.  I could work on improving that in myself.
Triumph: I've been running and lifting hard last weeks...Struggle: Yesterday I had a PMO binge sadly... (doing nofap). Guess trying to stop fapping/watching and drinking at the same time is quite hard for me at the moment. I often experience mood swings and excess energy and needed some relief...General: I will not drink with you today!
Triumph: Enjoying earlier mornings are nice getting up and getting more things done without the battle of a killer hangover to contend with. ..Struggle: Not being able to hide from my past (and the related present) in a bottle. It's hard facing up to my fuck ups but am trying to let them go leave them in the past and focus on the future. Still there's so many regrets.....General: Am watching more films music seems to be coming back into my conciousness. Maybe because I'm not numbing my emotions with drink any more. I remain in awe of all the triple figure badges on here 23 days seems good but it's only a beginning.
Triumph: 19 Days sober and I've now had a couple of evenings where it got to 9 /10 when I realised I hadn't thought about a drink. Funny how quickly habits form...Struggle: I've had a gout flare up. I used to get one once every 18 months and hadn't actually had one for over 2 years. I've read this is common during early recovery but it's a bitch and is effecting my mood...General: Dunno. I'll have something when it all doesn't hurt any more.
Happy Hump Day sober warriors!..Hope everyone is having a great week so far....**My triumph**  Just accepting I had a problem and taking the steps to fix it. ..**Struggle**  None just yet but the weekend is approaching and I think it will be a struggle. I'm going to have a lot of explaining to do and excusing myself from situations. .I also think my fiance is still mad at me for what happened on Saturday night. We squabbled on Monday evening because we're both under stress about trying to see out house. Then he came out with "and are you going to buy me a new coat??". I just broke down and went up to bed I couldn't face him right then.  I'm not ready to completely open up yet. Just let me get through the weekend first so he can see how serious I am about this. ...**General**  So one misconception I had about not drinking was how awake I'd feel in the mornings. I had visions of leaping out of bed to the sound of birds chirping (Cinderella style) cheerful and at one with the world.  Well I'm still a groggy mess in the morning but at least now I can put that down to my dear fiance waking me up with his snoring (honestly I thought somebody was running an engine in the bedroom at 04:30 this morning!!) and not down to having alcohol in my system messing up my sleep. Now to try and sort the snoring problem...
**Triumph**: I'm on top of my work and I've figured out a schedule that should allow me to stay on track whist still having a bit of free time so I don't get too stressed out.    .**Struggle**: Right now my only struggles are trivial and not weighing on me so much that I need to vent about them :)    .**General**: The woman you quoted from Heroin(e) is in the new louis theroux doc Heroin Town. Not uplifting and wouldnt recommend anyone watching if you're feeling fragile but he's so great at what he does.
**Triumph:**  I went to my 2nd AA meeting (this time round) &amp; my whole attitude towards the program (use what I can leave what doesn't work for me) has shifted dramatically for the positive! I am open to meeting new people also a dramatic positive shift :) &amp; I got some more work done in my garden...**Struggle:**  New people have moved in next door &amp; they are even worse behaved then previous lot - kids climbing on roofs &amp; my shed their dog is digging into my back yard &amp; they aren't fixing it over 20 of them congregate were I need to walk past to go out &amp; they are usually drunk &amp; aggressive!!! There has been so much anger &amp; seriously negative energy in my street this past week :(..**General:**  I still really really want to stop smoking I need to learn how to cope with the emotional fear of not having that crutch!!! I am adding slowly but surely to my list of things I want to accomplish or learn to do.... My one lovely supportive (non drinking) neighbour told me today how well I am doing &amp; that when I get through November &amp; December sober I will really have kicked butt (they are the months that I usually relapse) - but she believes I can do it :) So do I!!! LOL..Happy Hump day SD'ers
Triumph: My Third day sober Today feeling great and motivated. Luckily no physical reactions yet. Work is going well...Struggle: My brain is screaming for a bottle of wine after work and i have troubles falling asleep. ..General: Listening to Allen Carr when i go to bed. He has some interessting points. I will not drink today! :)
Uggghhh that health insurance company shit gets me so angry u/sfgirlmary! I'm sorry to hear about this and I hope they change those f'n rules...**Triumph:**    I never cared about spending frivolously when I was drinking - I had bottles of wine that could make car payment for fucks sake :/. Now that I'm sober I actually look at prices and I'm MUCH better at managing finances. As a result we just completely renovated K's bedroom for a fraction of the price (big shout out to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond!!)...**STRUGGLE:**    Although I've gotten better at financial stuff I'm still dealing with the aftermath of the path of destruction I left from my drinking days. I'm trying to catch up but it's not easy...**GENERAL:**    I'm so glad you mentioned that documentary on *Heroin* Mary. For the past 2 weeks I've been watching documentaries on alcoholism. For me I look at it like it's a dose of medicine - I realize that I was that way once too and if I pick up a single drink and have a *single sip* I **WILL** wind up right back there. And this time I won't make it out alive. Powerful stuff thanks for the reminder for hosting and for all you do for us here at SD dear Mary! Lots of Love (and Congrats again on cutting those med's in *half*!!!) xo &lt;3.
Triumph: I'm still alive .Struggle: feeling physically awful bc of not sleeping.General: if I recall this feeling I will never drink again but for now I definitely won't drink today!
Heading on vacation day; will be strange not to associate drinking as a necessary part of vacationing. But I will not drink with you today. 
Triumph: Yesterday was my first day off and alone at home since I made the decision to live sober. Normally I would drink all day and evening. Instead I cleaned out my closet of all the bottles that I had stashed in there and found some vodka in a bottle as well as a couple wine bottles with just under half in each one. I was tempted to either drink it or keep it as an emergency stash but I poured that poison down the drain and I felt giddy afterward because it made me feel like I have so much more control now...Struggle: I am now forced to face my anxiety head-on. Though I must say it's easier than I thought. Alcohol was making it much worse...General: watching TV shows that depict people drinking either moderately or heavily used to make me crave whatever they were drinking. Now I picture the disgusting feeling of when I used to secretly gulp down about half a bottle of wine in one breath and then shutter and the inevitable hangover from doing that several times a day. (I used to do that in secret to maintain a good buzz or drunk and then my husband would only see me with my one or two drinks that I would sip in front of him.)
Good morning!!!..Triumph: it's been one week since my last drink. I haven't updated my badge yet Bc I've started over and fucked up again so many times I was tired of having a reset to day one every four days. So I'm waiting. I feel stronger and more committed than I think I ever have. I am legit terrified to start drinking again Bc it could be years before I am ready to stop again. Realizing that finally though is a good push..I'm less bloated and my skin and eyes look healthy...Struggle: fearing for the time when the pink cloud wears off and my resolve wanes. One day at a time is helping.  I'm crying a lot. My guilt over what I've put my family through is heavy. ..Friends I'm avoiding/ scared to communicate with: One friend in particular is the girl I broke my 18 month sobriety with four years ago. I kept thinking getting back on the wagon was just around the corner. But it took four years a multiverse of hangovers bad decisions and emotional meltdowns. ..The other is a girl I met a few months ago while I was in a 2 month sober stretch. She was in recovery too and we bonded over that. Then we decided we should go to a party together and we both drank. We maintained a drinking friendship for a while..I've been avoiding her calls and I feel guilty but I don't know what to say to her. ..General: got a massage yesterday which I used to never do on account of the fact that they make your hangovers so much worse. It's insane the way I used to prioritize drinking. I wouldn't schedule any appointments after 11am Bc I knew I'd be too drunk by then to do much. I took myself to lunch and got dessert and coffee instead of getting wasted. I didn't have to fight cravings. ..I am grateful for this day and just for today I will not drink..Thank you SD   
My struggle is I feel emotionally numb and bored and I know that drink would be a remedy to to this at least temporarily but I know it will just make me feel worse after and I'll crave more drink. So I'm staying sober regardless of what I want to do. 
I will not drink today and I'm glad to be where I am today...Triumph - No hangovers! Yes after about 6 years of daily hangovers I am finally free of the anxiety confusion shaking and headaches I would wake up to daily. ..Struggle - There is so much time! Sounds odd but I now have so much more time in the day and evening that I'm trying to fill with things other than drinking. Every evening after putting the girls to bed I still have the urge to take the edge off with a drink but I have a snack and watch Netflix or read. Learning to relax naturally....it's a challenge but with a new routine or 2 I feel like this will get better...General - I am feeling overall better. Things can be a bit much at times so I'm trying to take it easy as the days roll along. My husband who doesn't drink is a bit disappointed in my decreased sex drive but I assure him it's just because I'm going through something difficult and I'm running off survival mode these first few weeks. I think he gets it but I can't worry about that right now. I have to focus on getting better before I can make things better for others.
Triumph: No hangovers in the morning! More money in my meager bank account. WOOT!..Struggle: Depressed anxious bad sleep exhausted. No job and all of the rejection from looking makes me want to escape. Wah!..General: I have over a dozen vodka bottles hidden in my closet. I used to roll them in old clothes and bag everything up for Goodwill (sorry Good Will workers!). Today I am going to put them in the recycling bin and not care what the garbage folks think. Woot!..Woots: 2; Wah:1. Awesome!.
**Triumph:** I've gotten to the point where I can say "It'll be two years in January" when people ask how long it's been since I drank. That feels pretty great...**Struggle:** Finding it hard to get motivated at work. I'm just floating through the day not engaging in anything and just waiting for the day to end...**General:** Over this past weekend I learned a lot about cryptocurrency and am learning the ins and outs of buying and selling on exchanges with $5. It's fascinating and I'm starting to really get into it. 
Day 2 for me. ..Triump- What surprises me is that this will be the THIRD hump-day that I have not drank. When in reality before that I could not remember a day in 2-3 months I did not have alcohol. Couple hick-ups but I feel good today...Struggle- This year has been hell to say the least. I dumped a couple year opiate habit(back pain meds) for weed 6 months ago. I feel amazing for that. I have been getting off benzos this last year too. I feel I am clean of both and this is the last step...General- Lots of emotions coming and going. I feel good though. It amazed me how much time I spent drinking ect. There is so much more time to do stuff I literally get done more in a day that I would all week drinking it seems.
Triumph: I saw my parents off on Monday as they headed south for the winter. My dad has always been a man of few words but as we hugged and said our goodbyes he let me know he was proud of me. It just feels really good to hear it. ..Struggle: Downsizing at work is coming again. I feel like I should be more worried about it than I am and getting a plan together. But this time around I just feel like if it happens then it happens. I really don't want it to happen though...General: My step daughter's mother has organized several opioid/heroin awareness events in her community. I've gone to show support and try to connect with other grieving families who have lost someone. It's such a hard thing when it seems like there is no answer to this problem that it will never go away and we can't make a difference. But there is hope in sharing the stories and in reaching out and never giving up even when it seems hopeless. 
**Triumph:** Yesterday after yoga another student thanked me for my practice. Apparently I was "very grounded" and "an anchoring presence" for her. That's great because.....**Struggle:** The yoga studio is one of the places I go to process and discard a bunch of negative emotion. I carried a bunch of nasty tangled feelings--stress from work family--in the door and left them on the floor. It helps me and apparently helped others...**General:** I've been reading parts of "Addiction: a disorder of choice." The sections I like are really interesting--applying a bio-economic model of decision-making. The sections I struggle with--attacks on the disease model (good points I agree but can't read the chapters) and history of addiction (became an issue in the western world in 16-17 centuries with the introduction of distilled spirits and opium)--are interesting but I can't stand the discursive pedantic writing style and get easily frustrated.
Keep on keepin on...I will not drink with you today. 
Triumph: I am thinking about "not drinking" a bit less and therefore paying more attention to work and home tasks. ..Struggle: Certainly it's a privilege to work for myself and set my own schedule yet it's a constant struggle to decide how much time to allocate to work vs. home/parenting vs. health vs. friends and then just leisure/recreation. Both my list of "have to do's" and "want to do's" feels endless. I feel tired out by it today. ..General: There has to be a better answer on health care. Need some leadership there. 
**Triumph:**  Woke up early and made breakfast and lunch for my SO and myself.  Also made lunch for him to take to work.  All healthy food.  Stayed present to each individual in my family and ushered them into their day with love...**Struggle:**  I'm seriously having a hard time making myself study for my test today.  I'm just sick of looking at the function of the cell...**General:**  I got "The Naked Mind" on Audible last night and my husband started listening to it first thing this morning while he showered.  I'm looking forward to listening too.  I will not drink with you all today.
Triumph: Feeling extremely creative and clear-headed for the first time in a long time. BP down from the 140s/80s (which has concerned my doc) to 120s/70s. .Struggle: I do not sleep. I guess all I did before was pass out. .General: just finished the book "Kick the Drink...Easily" by Jason Vale. Definitely a different way to look at the idea that you're "giving up" something. 
Just a General but Louis Theroux has a new documentary on the same town as well. Heroin Town...I'm feeling great. No today that's for sure.
**Triumph:** 80 days!!!!..**Struggle:** I'm starting to think I should try therapy to deal with all my general worry and dread (now that I don't have drinking to "help"  me "deal with it") but ugh where will I find the time and money for that?!..**General:** Heading out of town to visit some college friends this weekend--I'm SUPER excited because I haven't seen them in years and also excited that I got a rental car for the weekend so if I need to duck out and get some La Croix while they're drinking I can!
**Triumph:** When I weighed in yesterday I was under 230 lbs which is the lightest I've been in over a year! It goes beyond cutting out alcohol. When I drank I would make bad food choices loaded with empty calories. I don't think my clothes fit much differently but it's still a nice scale victory. ..**Struggle:** I think the girl I'm into is gay. She's definitely queer but I don't know if that means gay or bi. I only see her once or twice a week though so that makes it easier but still...I'm still a bit lonely I guess...**General:** I can't wait for fall to fully hit. My new tent just came in and my sleeping pad should be in by the end of the week which means camping for the first time in over a year! Realistically the soonest I can go is the first weekend in November so there's plenty of time to figure out where I'm going. I can't wait!
I'm not dead yet! So I'll have the time of my life today - or at least have a decent day at work and a nice evening when I get home. All because I'm choosing not to drink with you today!
T:  Fall came.  I was worried it wouldn't. ..S:  Nursing school.   Exam tomorrow  not ready.  Will be studying all day...G:  I'm not sure anymore if herion addiction is worse than alcohol. With alcohol  it's cheap and it's everywhere.   And there's constant bombardments announcing it's presence.   Tv radio internet all selling an illusion.   Addiction is addiction and it sucks either way.
Triumph: Celebrated my birthday over the weekend. I went to see the Geese migration at a nature conservatory and it was fascinating to see thousands of Geese flying in all at once. .Struggle: Sigh. Still hate my job.  .General: Latest documentary I watched was Chaos and Creation Franca Sozzani. I thought it was fascinating. As someone who has completely failed in the career part of life watching this ultra successful woman was fascinating. And bittersweet. 
Triumph: Finished the first part of a hard project. The next part is easier and more enjoyable but even more work...Struggle: Fell off the wagon last night and hate myself today...General: Terrified about the next few weeks. I need to be at my best and I feel at my worst. 
**Triumph:**  I really struggled last week. I was dealing with a lot of self talk and really ahd to work my tools. But I didnt give up. I used my resources my tools my support network. I used ALL of it. I used here. And I made it through that rough patch. I feel better these last few days. Im relieved I didnt give in. I know it's not the last rough patch tehre will b e many but I know I can get through them. ...**Struggle:** I'll be home alone this weekend. Time alone is always difficult but knowing I have the whole weekend to myself has been putting some ideas in my ideas so to speak. I'm making plans. I will face this prepared. ...**General:** I've been thinking a lot about accountability lately and who I am really accountable to. Why do I really care? What is my pride really worth? Who really gives a shit? In the end no one is going to be judging me but me. I dont have a summation here but mulling it all over. I dunno. 
**Triumph**: 90 days sober today!!..**Struggle**: going to my first sober wedding this weekend and seeing lots of friends I haven't seen in months and years. Little nervous but I hope to have fun. ..**General**: still on vacation and don't want it to end!
Triumph: I reset my badge this morning as an act of honesty. Over the last couple of years I have progressed a little I think.  Not having to reset my badge is the ultimate goal...but being honest and staying here on SD is progress..Struggle: Not turning a sober day into a day of binging on food my primary addiction..General: Working on a craft project is my "safe place to go" now.
**Triumph:**  Still sober hit the gym yesterday for a mini workout and still on my paleo challenge...**Struggle:**  Trying not to freak out about the fact that I have no retirement savings at 42.  Making a plan to list the most important purchases over the next year to plan for and then move my monthly savings to an IRA.  But man I sometimes wish I had been money-focused as a young woman or that it wasn't as important as it is.  It feels like youth should be used for experiences and learning not immediately focusing on making money.  Frustrating...**General:** I need Halloween costume ideas.  I love face painting.
Triumph: I attended my very first SMART meeting yesterday and left feeling amazing - something I've never found in other group therapy settings. I really liked the program and methodology; I think I'll go back! ;)..Struggle: My husband is mad in a way I've never seen him after this last relapse. While it unfortunately took him addressing his real feelings with me for me to fully understand how selfish my choice to have a beer (or seven as it always turns out) really is I'm terrified this is the time he's not sticking around to wait for me to change and he absolutely wouldn't be wrong for leaving. ..General: I don't know; I'm only on Day 2... I've had a million Day 2s but not as many as Day 1s... That's not nothing I guess. 
triumph: today was another day 1. i looked up the meeting locations of my local aa chapter. .struggle: today was another day 1. 
Triumph - I'm finally getting some restful sleep making plans for the immediate future and I'm taking my health seriously again for the first time in a year. ..Struggle - I keep fantasizing about drinking thinking if I start again it wouldn't be so bad this time around. Also the past year of extreme over-indulgence in alcohol has led me from being in the greatest shape of my life to the worst and all the rapid weight gain has now resulted in me feeling mild chest pain for the past couple of weeks. (Re: Triumph - this has given me incentive to start taking my health seriously again with dieting and exercise)..General - Just watched the Family Guy episode where Brian torments Stewie with the Queen - News of the World album art and that has me currently on a Queen binge for the first time in a while. Also just managed to do 100 crunches and 25 2-count cross-crunches pretty easily despite being 60-70lbs overweight so kinds glad I still have some decent core strength. Prepping for a run as I type this. ..**Happy Hump Day y'all!!!**
Triumph: I started to clean up my diet today and started the C25K again. Since I only quit that recently staring from scratch was actually pretty easy...Struggle: friends want to go out this weekend but I need to be strong and say no. I'm working over it anyway so that's a decent excuse...General: Even though I was craving junk food earlier now I'm in bed I'm fine and not even slightly hungry. Also not been craving the booze either. 
Anyone know if any over the counter vitamins are such are good for brain repair in recovery from alcohol and drugs?..Heard fish oil is good so may start taking it.
Triumph: I'm thinking a lot less about not drinking and more about just doing what I want to do...Struggle: I hit my head monday night and ended up with a concussion. Ended up with a surprise four days off from work where I can't really do anything...General: I've been daydreaming a bit about making a visit to Portland just to go to Powell's because it's been too long since I've been there. Every time I'm in there I feel like I could blow an entire paycheck on books.
