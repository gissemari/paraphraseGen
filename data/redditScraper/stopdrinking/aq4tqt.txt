We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together! Welcome to the 24 hour pledge! I'm pledging myself to not drinking today no matter what happens good or bad and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others. It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours let's not drink alcohol! This pledge is a statement of intent. Today we don't set out trying not to drink we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset! What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up. What this is: A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning. What this isn't: A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread. This post goes up at: US Night/Early Morning Europe Morning Asia and Australia Evening/Night A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar. *****..Snow shoveling season is coming up. This has in my past attempts presented a problem as there's not much better than one or four Hot Toddies after shoveling. Definitely helps to "play the tape forward" at times like that. I used to also keep a 30 pack of cheapo beer outside and pound em back as I shoveled. Never ended up well. Also because I'm clearly a masochist I decided to quit caffeine as well. Though to be fair I'm not struggling with that nearly as much. I'm actually kind of diggin' it. I can't remember the last four day stretch of such great sleep. ..

I put in some headphones and listen to a few good podcasts when I have to do it. 
I will not drink with you today.

*Welp* the big storm's slowly pulling away and the power is still on so I got that going for me; heat lights *internet* and most of all *coffee*. (The older I get the more my *wants* are in inverse proportion to my *needs*.) I know everything is coated with ice on top of &gt;5" snow but it's still too dark for me to risk an outdoor personal assessment. ..Whatever you're doing today and wherever you're doing it do it safe 'n sober. 
IWNDWYT
Not today. Not today. Not today!!!!
Good morning. Yet another snowstorm here! I was up bright and early and decided to take my weight and measurements. Down 4lbs and a few inches in just a week's time. IWNDWYT!

Proud to be sober today
Good morning all you fine friendly people! Feeling a bit sleepy dragging myself out of bed for work today  but it isn't nearly the anxious sweaty affair it used to be. IWNDWYT!! 
Iwndwyt
My husband beat me to the shoveling this morning so I will have to wait for the next storm. ..I'm way behind on work so need to knuckle down today so I can have some free time on the weekend.  My evil voice is squawking but I'm NOT NOT NOT drinking!  
Not drinking with you today !! 
Rounding a month but getting anxious about an upcoming vacation.  Vacations have always been drunk fests for me.  But today I will not drink.
I'm not drinking today!
No drinking here!
I will not drink today!
I've thought about quitting caffeine or at least reigning it in a bit. I definitely drink too much coffee. :) Two months of no alcohol for me today which means I will probably try and brave this brutal weather and go to a meeting. Happy to be not drinking today with you!
Shoveling snow and drinking when you have alcoholism induced hypertension is very dangerous. That's how my 40s were shaping up before I quit! :)..I will not drink with y'all today.
Day 10!  Only you guys know how huge if an accomplishment this is!  Here's to 10 more.
I'm not going to drink alcohol today 
How's it smurfing soberniks?! Traps triggers and temptations be smurfed!  No chains and shackles for us!  Solidarity.  IWNDWYT 
No booze today!
Ahhhh yes chair-mouse!  The whiskey warm up after the snow clean up was something I looked forward to as well.   Cheap case of beer outside?  Ditto.  We don't do that over here anymore though and we don't miss it!  But I would miss my coffee so I will keep that in my snowy day (or any other day!) routine.  ..I'm not going to be drinking with anyone today and I am glad to be in such lovely company!..Big love and sober hugs!
IWNDWYT 
Good  morning SD I will not drink w/you today. 
Done shoveling again!!!  Winter blows in Wisconsin.  IWNDWYT.

IWNDWYT
Not gonna drink today 
IWNDWYT 
My dad that almost died from alcohol 2 years ago and he had to quit he had to come to town for business and was drinking whiskey again last night. I am not doing well and it feels like I can't tell anyone. These anti depressants are surely making me feel worse. I thought about suicide most of the day and struggling to keep awake. Not drinking today...
I'm finally feeling better and usually I would forget the sickness and jump right back in but I will Not drink today
I will not drink today!
Wind storm last had me tossin' and turnin' all night. I'm sleepy this morning but not hungover. That's a million billion times better. IWNDWYT.
IWNDWYT
Out of the past 100 days  ive been sober for 93 of them.  Today is day 7 though. IWNDWYT God willing 
IWNDWYT
Happy Wednesday! IWNDWYT

Morning from the UK! Am really tired today- I just worked a half day so might try and have a sleep before Ponylad2 is home from school - all well though- I will not drink with you today  
Happy midweek!..IWNDWYT!  
Lacking energy today but glad for the clear head. Not drinking with you all.

I will not drink today!
Good morning!  I will not drink with you today. 
I will not drink with you today. 
Big day here!! 2 years!! My super power is staying sober!!! IWNDWYT!   
Good morning SD! Just here to say I'm not drinking today and I invite you to do so with me as well. 
Just went to the dentist for the first time in 5+ years after 10 years of oral tobacco usage and drinking expecting the worst. Dentist said everything looked good except a single cavity and that I could definitely use a routine cleaning! Feeling pretty relieved IWNDWYT!
At this point it's starting to get easier and harder. The hard part now seems to be keeping out that mentality that I could handle occasional drinking. I quit cold turkey 15 days ago and I plan to stay completely sober. It's amazing starting to actually be productive in the evenings and my focus during the day is slowly starting to improve.
I will not drink today. In fact I'm going to meet up with some other sober old geezers at a coffee shop in a few hours just to hang out and shoot the shit. Have a good one.
The weekend is coming and I'm nervous I will forget myself. ..But that's a struggle for another day. ..IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT. 
It's Wednesday!  I will not drink with you today!
I got 6.5 hours of sleep last night. That's a lot for me. I am feeling proud of all the self care I am implementing. I will not drink with you today. 
Hello all. I'm back to say I won't drink today. No way no way 
IWNDWYT 
I will not drink
iwndwyt
No drinking today. I'm better without it.
Have a cold and am tired af ... but not gonna drink. Happy hump day y'all. IWNDWYT 
Passed day 5 and I intend to finish day 6. I will not drink with you today.
I can't give up my caffeine yet. I've been slowly drinking less and less if it though. I mostly get it through tea now so there's not a whole lot of it anymore. Maybe someday! ..I will not drink with you today!   
I will not drink with you all today!.
Don't forget how good you felt this morning. Keep it going. I will not drink today!!
Badge is very inaccurate...But I'm not drinking today.
I will not drink today.
I will stay off the booze today. Quit or die 
Good morning all..I will not be drinking with you today and I will never drink again and I will never change my mind. 
Not going to drink today. 
IWNDWYT 
Finally we are feeling better at our house! We have not been able to see our grand daughter since we got home! Our son says she has been asking after us! I will visit her this afternoon &amp; next week we have her for 6 days and nights while her parents go to Mexico to worship Phish! **IWNDWYT!!!**
I will not drink today!
My scale said 198.4 this morning I made it back to the ones.  No wine for me today. I know it's due not drinking and not eating a lot since Thurston passed away 7 weeks. Widowhood sucks.   I am resilient I'll get through this crap. ..I ain't Stinkin' Drinkin'..          .
Chair Mouse it's good to hear your getting good sleep! I'm getting better sleep as well. .I will not drink today!
I will not drink today.  
I will not drink today!
I won't drink today!
Day 11 been getting an itchy uncomfortable feeling the last 2 days. I'd like to think its something else but I know alcohol trying to kick in the door. No dice buddy told myself after a month I can buy a bunch of vinyl records for the first time in years(why spend that money on a hobby you like when you can buy gin?) and I intend on buying them! IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT- thankful to you Sobernauts 
IWNDWYTPeace all
Bye bye alcohol I may see you some day but not today.
IWNDWYT. I'm on day 29     
IWNDWYT
Good morning from California!  Day 12 for me.  Love reading all your lovely messages every day.  It helps me so much.  I have my eyeballs on this sub many times throughout the day.  Blessings to you all!!    Gigi. IWNDWYT 
Good luck today. I know today that I don't have to drink alcohol. Now coffee and water are a different subject...I have some Guatemalan in the french press. I can be comfortable in my own skin.  A precious gift is my ability to set the day aside and sleep all night.  And to wake up rather than come to...
Morning everyone. IWNDWYT
I will not drink today. 
Coming up on a handful of days again! I will not drink with you all today!
IWNDWYT!
I will not drink with you today 
6 weeks of sober days and sober nights! Instead of time traveling as the booze tends to do I have thoroughly enjoyed each and every day of sobriety. I feel so present.  I'm not dwelling in the past or tripping about the future; I am living each day in the moment.  It hasn't been easy but it does get easier.  #IWNDWYT 
Not yesterday not today not tomorrow. 
Almost forgot to check in. Not drinking today! Woo! 
Day 23. IWNDWYT 
I got my first good night sleep last night.  Feeling really good!  Was even a few pounds lighter on the scale this morning.  Everyday is a little bit better when I'm not consuming   .  
I'm in. No alcohol for me today. Adding to our strength in number!  
I'm not drinking today no matter what happens no matter how I feel.
I will not drink with you today
Actually looking forward to this sober day number two! I will not drink with you today!
Have battled alcoholism in a sales exec job for years. Finally committed to sobriety two years ago. At a work conference and in the past I would be tearing up the bar(s) starting with double gin and tonics at 4 PM. Instead went for a 4 mile run yesterday morning saw the sunrise over a bridge and ended the evening with room service watching college basketball. Turns out the illusion of the hard drinking sales guy can easily be dispelled. Feel great and thankful to my SO for helping me turn it around. Looking forward to a productive and fun day. Have a great day everyone! IWNDWYT.
Been a while since I was here but it's always such a help. IWNDWYT!
I have a jam-packed day of work today (I'm a contractor) and normally I'd celebrate the end of a billable14-hour day with some serious drinking.   .But - I'm forearmed with some bubbly water and IWNDWYT.
I will not drink today!!! Although I think I'm beyond hope for coffee. 
Happy Wednesday! Still not drinking! 
IWNDWYT 
I will not drink today. 
Still sick still sober.  Might see a doc today.  Woke up at 6:30 and played bongos while my kiddos played xylophone and drums.  Hungover me would not have been able to pull that off! IWNDWYT 
IWNDWYT 
Staying sober.
Good morning! Day 3! Iwndwyt. 
IWNDWYT!
Can't believe I made it this far. Had a really challenging day yesterday from start to finish but instead of drinking I used sleep instead. It was super effective. IWNDWYT
Day 136 of not drinking. IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you today!
IWNDWYT  
I won't drink with you today even though I feel like I really need to. I'll try exercising or reading or smoking or whatever. Peace
Checking in. IWNDWYT!
Day 11. IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT 
First sober quick one night business trip tonight! Day four and feeling good. I'll not be drinking with you today. 
I will not drink with you today 
No drinking today or the next 24 hours.
IWNDWYT 
I'M DOWN 11 LBS TOTAL TODAY!!! I stalled for a few weeks and was getting frustrated (probably because I drank right before I stalled) I owe it to not drinking because I eat shit food when I'm drunk or hungover.  Definatly not drinking today!!!
I will not drink today!
I've been struggling pretty badly lately. I need to change things up. New sponsor more prayer and readings in the mornings more communication and self-inventory. I've learned it's really hard to clear out negative stuff if you let it build up. It can be equally hard to not recognize that resentments are brewing if I don't take the time to evaluate myself. ..Anyway...I'm not drinking now and with the help of my higher power and you fine people I'm hoping to not drink at all today. 
Just got up. Checking in. Glad to be feeling fresh again. Alcohol sucks. Sobriety rules. IWNDWYT. 
I don't have to deal with shoveling snow in the south but man I did love a hot toddy or three when it's cold outside. (Before switching to straight bourbon of course. I rarely stopped drinking after a couple hot toddies. Also I made my hot toddies with half a pint or more of bourbon...wanting something hot to drink did not in any way hinder me from ingesting copious amounts of alcohol)..IWNDWYT
My job makes me want to scream sometimes.  It goes from 0 to 100 so quickly sometimes.  Trying to get myself out of this situation.  I know that alcohol will not help.  Just need to vent sometimes.
It's so amazing how manageable my life and problems feel. They're there but I feel like the man with the plan. Imma go get it this month!..This not drinking thing is pretty damn awesome. Best to everyone out there no matter what stage you are at. Fight the good fight! IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT.
Feeling strong and taking recovery seriously this time I will not drink today!
IWNDWYT..I've been having dreams about drinking but it only makes me feel guilty and then I feel so relieved when I wake up and realize it didn't actually happen :)..Not drinking feels good. 
Good morning everyone! Haven't had a drink since the 22nd of January. Last night the craving for a drink was really bad so I threw on some gym clothes and ran and ran and ran until my legs ached. Self-control feels amazing. IWNDWYT!
Home sick for day 4.  Not alcohol related I don't think.  My kid had a cold last week. You can't blame every bad thing on Alcohol.  At least it will make not drinking today an easy choice.  IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT
This will be day three and I am not drinking today and I have absolutely no desire to. I slept great last night!
Not drinking today!
Feeling pretty depressed today and I dont want to get out of bed but I have work tonight and I will not drink!

Checking in!
IWNDWYT    
Thursday here but IWNDWYT 24 hours. Telling tomorrow nights thoughts to fuck off in advance. Get back to sleep now. 
Had an absolutely brutal drinking dream last night...6 months or so ago I spent pretty much the entire weekend of his bachelor party blackout drunk. I'd drink til passing out waking after a few hours just to get as drunk as possible and pass out again. It was an absolute nightmare and a sign that I'd sunk to the furthest depths I ever had previously and needed to get sober again. That was almost 6 months ago and I've been sober since that weekend...Last night I dreamt I had drank to blacking out again at his wedding (which is happening next month) made an ass of myself and generally ruined the entire thing. It was one of those dreams that wrecks you and makes you want to cry. It took me a few moments after waking to remember it was just a dream and I nearly wept again with relief...No drink will ever feel as good as waking up to find a dream like that only to realize it hadn't happened. I look forward to another sober day today. Thanks for being here SD.
I will not drink today no matter what!  Screw that misery and wreckage. 
I will not drink today
Not drinking today! Commute downtown wasn't nearly as bad as I was anticipating and the park I walk through to get to the subway station was so beautiful this morning it brought a smile to my face. Trees coated in ice some big beautiful snowflakes tumbling down from the sky. I'm usually not a big fan of winter but it was like something out of a storybook :) Trying to accept and appreciate what IS has been a big part of my practice lately and winter is a great time to challenge myself! 
Promising to not drink today. Here's to hopefully one more day on the books 
IWNDWYT!!
I will not drink with you today.
Nearly 2 months there are differences and it's only just the beginning.  Iwndwyt. 
I screwed up again. I get so tired of letting myself and my family down. I hate the disappoint I see in their eyes. I keep trying to stop but can't seem to make it more than a couple of days. Here's day one again!  I will not drink with you today!  
Day 55 I am staying sober today 
Happy Galentine's Day to all my fabulous sober ladies out there! I will not drink with all of you today!
Checking in.   Staying stronger than my Beer Beast .  IWNDWYT

At least for today I will not drink
I will not drink with you today!
I will not drink today.
Day Four! The longest I've ever gone without even a sip of alcohol!! I feel so proud of myself and of all of those posts I read from you all here. All of you keep me going and motivate me so much!!! Tons of love and IWNDWYT       
IWNDWYT 
Day three and I am already noticing improvements. It's just the second time this month that I've made it two nights but I'm still proud of it! IWNDWYT. 
Not drinking today no way!!!
Yesterday was the first day in a few weeks I didn't feel like sleeping at lunch. Still tired in the mornings though...In the past when I've been sober I've seen the "groupthink" when it comes to alcohol and was able to see it even during this last relapse but discounted it. Now I'm starting to see it for real...IWNDWYT
Today   I'm sober for my family and my health &amp; wellbeing.  
IWNDWYT
No drinking today.
IWNDWYT 
Over 30 days sober. This is definitely a big change for the better. Let's keep going.
Still going strong! IWNDWYT!
Just found you guys through a dead subreddit I was seeking. I haven't been counting... can someone tell me how it helps to keep track of days? Nearing 30 daysish. IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT
Hey all! I will not drink with you today and I will remain vigilant BUT it is damn hard at the minute  
Checking in on day 13 which is nearly over. Did not drink and will not drink. Stay strong my friends.

Yet another good day not to drink  
I will not drink you all today!
I will not drink with you today.
50 days 9 hours 43 minutes. I W N D W Y T!
Less than 2 months to my 1 year... Still not sure what I'm going to do how I'm going to do it or where it's going to lead me...  .  .Told myself at 6 months that I wouldn't make a decision on drinking again until the 1 year mark... As I hit that I'm starting to think I may not be ready to make that choice.  .  .But that's neither here nor there... Today I will not drink with you.
I won't drink today.
My first SD post. Two weeks in.  IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT!
Enjoying my new job enjoying life. A life without booze is  
Not drinking today y'all!
Super close to that big circle 2 by my name...I imagined my drink of choice today which used to be the code for "looks like I'm stopping by the store today". It wasn't a battle somehow. Awesome!..I will not drink with you today.
I will not drink with you today.    
I will not drink today.
I will not drink tonight. Day 14.
Rough few days. IWNDWYT
Ugh I am ten months sober yesterday and I am not ok.  Mostly I'm confronting my past fuck-ups head-on and it seems like one after another just keeps ramming me.  .I am practicing gratitude because that sense of urgency and thankfulness is what keeps me sober.  That and service.
Today is the beginning of day 10 of not drinking for me.  So by now I should have all the alcohol out of my system and now I can just focus on my health and inner thoughts...IWNDWYT
Day 16! Half way until a month! It's been hard. Dreamt about wine last night but even in my dream I didn't drink. IWNDWYT 
IWNDWYT
Day one! Hopefully this sub serves me as some motivation...Pretty confident I'll get through this day no booze in the house and not going anywhere. If I had any around it'd break for sure. 
I will not drink today.
Iwndwy
Checking in while making bacon and waffles for dinner! Pecan chips in my waffles  
Have one day under my belt. I will not drink with you today!
IWNDWYT everyone!
Today/this weekend is going to hard.... at an annual convention where there is a lot of drinking/socializing at night.... simply being here makes me want a drink and I just arrived. I'm just going to fill myself with delicious food and hit the hotel gym early everyday. I can do this! 
Still not drinking today. 
Day 130! Iwndwyt 
Doing some house cleaning and giving away all our liquor (which I never drink so it's not a temptation) because I want our house to represent our lifestyle. IWNDWYT
I will not drink today

One of my best friends fell off the wagon after a year and a half... willingly as he describes it. Oh well. I wont drink with him or you!
I not drinking today!
Well I needed to wait a bit today to see what would happen. Things haven't been great. And tonight I was so tempted. But I ordered some great Indian food and I'm listening to Metallica and there is no booze happening.  IWNDWYT.
won't drink today
I'm here. Not drinking today. 
I have 3 more days till my 140 mark. Went to dinner tonight and the smell of my mother in laws wine made me kind of sick to my stomach (shocking!). I had a big bottle of San Pelligrino and was just fine. I don't really miss it- the benefits have been to great..IWNDWYT friends! 
It's my birthday and I am still sober. As many people say "first sober birthday in...." I don't know maybe 19 years. Have a great day!
IWNDWYT!
Wanted a drink badly these last few days but it seems to have passed. I'm glad I didn't drink. Need to start running again. Off the smokes though and feeling much better for it. Thanks for being here yall. Iwndwyt
Reallllly wanted to drink tonight. My husband ran and bought me a CBD sparkling water and a dark chocolate covered ice cream bar instead.   
Hey everyone.  Forgot to pledge this morning but made it through the day.  Here's to not drinking with you again tomorrow!
It's my first day here. I'm not going to drink today. 
I'm a long time lurker and am on day 1 of a lengthy sobriety kick.  Attended my first AA meeting today.  Wish me luck! ..IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you today

Watching my fav basketball team play an exciting game on TV with a cup of coffee instead of a beer. Wednesday's are ok with me! 
Not today devil not today
I won't/didn't drink today! 
Have a good day everyone! IWNDWYT
