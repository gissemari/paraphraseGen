As I reflect on the past year and a half the hardest thing for me has been having to decline whoever is offering me a drink. Especially if you have made a bond with a significant other or friend through drinking- you are breaking that code and it can seem to them as odd or even a betrayal. It is such an innocent and kind gesture on their part to offer a drink and I am a people pleaser so I do not want to let them down. However after making the decision to stop I have become extremely comfortable with saying  no  (in a polite manner of course) and risk making them question me further.  That usually never happens though because I squash it by saying  no thanks but I'll take a water.   No more pushing happens after that. Now I'm a pro at it- it just takes practice to get the wording and timing right. I was making it a huge deal. It really isn't. Just wanted to make this post incase anyone else is struggling with having to manage social situations like this- like the beginning of parties or being at a bar with new friends or co-workers. Decline and then offer a solution! They won't get mad/upset at you for asking for an alternative. Thanks everyone for your posts.

I met up with a friend at a restaurant and she had a drink waiting for me! I felt so bad! But I had brought a water bottle and sipped from it until my non-alcoholic drink came and she was happy to have the drink she'd ordered for me. I couldn't trust myself with nothing in front of me to drink so I had to get over drinking my water until the waiter came back. You gotta do what you gotta do social niceties be damned.
