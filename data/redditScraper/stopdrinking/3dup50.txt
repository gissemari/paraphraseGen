This is the longest ive gone in 3 years without alcohol.I'm at 71 days and i never thought i could do it.But i did!I am hoping io won't fail again after having achieved  this much.I used to drink every day all day and have been trying to get sober since june 2014i kept relapsing and i made it to 68 days september-november and after that i would lapse every 20-30 days.But i think ive succeeded this time i have no interest in drinking alcohol anymore.I'm sticking to pepsi max and tea.I still have issues im trying to deal with but im not letting them make me drink booze anymore.Sorry for the long post i am just happy i have made it this far.
