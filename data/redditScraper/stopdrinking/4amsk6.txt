Hey everyone!..My brother [M24] has been struggling with his drinking ever since he started drinking in his mid-teens. He's struggled to quit a few times in the years past but has always failed before or around 30 days. After seeing my [F22] success with (early!) sobriety he's reached out to me for help.  ..I'm trying to check in with him every day or every other day but he drank the other day when I forgot to check in with him. ..I really want him to succeed but we live in separate states and the whole check-in thing didn't work since I suck at it. Other than AA and this place what would be a good resource that I could give him? Should I try to call him everyday?

I'd try and keep in touch with him daily. See if you can set up some video chats through google or skype. Maybe plan out some trips for him to come visit or you to go visit him. 
Congratulations first on your success and his desire to follow suit!..I believe that first and foremost you keep your focus on your efforts.  Remember in the airplane they say "Put YOUR oxygen mask on first before assisting Others".   I see that you're making real progress...He needs "local" support where he is; a network fellowship tools and methods.  Then you can provide ancillary support and encouragement.  ..I think you both could get creative with with something like "SSN".  Sibling Sobriety Network!  You could facetime/skype at predesignated times.  Have a format when you each say "And now our reported in the field in 'Our_Town' '_State' with an important update."  You could find all kinds of fun ways to do this.  Best sober moment from the day.  Story about the most bizarre AA narrative (while maintaining anonymity for sources).  Picture of your favorite example of "Peace and Serenity."  Updates on "and now this from our catalogs of "Restless Irritable and Discontents".   And what would be my favorite:  "Today's Random Act of Kindess (AoK). ..I'd love to hear about different ways and AoKs that y'all come up with or ANYTHING that you find to be helpful that I (and others) could use to support of friends and colleagues in their journey!  Good luck and keep us posted!..https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/45ewy0/kindness_karma/.
You could share the [Baby Steps post with him.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)
&gt;but he drank the other day when I forgot to check in with him...but he drank the other day when ~~I forgot to check in with him~~ he chose to drink again. ..The choice to drink his always his. I would be willing to support and encourage him but I'd make him make the effort to seek it out (beyond normal brother-sister conversations). I would also share with him what works for me.
