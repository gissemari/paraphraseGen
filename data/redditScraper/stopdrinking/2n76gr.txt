Hey everybody..if you are out there lurking or thinking about checking out AA or have checked it out but not liked it I hope you find this post helpful. I have been actively searching for a meeting I liked for the past little while and I finally found one! Wow what a difference it can make. From meetings that all they talk about is god to meetings by candlelight I have seen a lot in the past little while whilst searching. ..What I am getting at is if you have checked out AA but didn't like it after one meeting try checking out some more and hopefully you will find one you jive with. I have gone from going just for the sake of going to actively looking forward to this meeting that I found. There is a great mix of young and old people and it was full of laughter and positivity. It is a huge contrast to one other meeting I checked out which is just full on depressing. PM me if you are struggling with AA and finding meetings you like I know how it feels. I just wanted to make a quick post to let you know that even if you don't like it at first there is the possibility that you will find a meeting you really like! Good luck out there!

YES!  Good for you!  I'm almost 3 months in and already have a home group and I STILL meeting hop to find good ones for my repertoire.  
This is an excellent point. I am a firm believer in shopping around to find the best meeting. 
Excellent advice! This worked for me too.
Good stuff and true
Great message. I think the important point about checking out AA or other recovery resources beyond SD is that it involves an actual physical commitment to sober action.  
For the first year I went to the same meetings partly because I felt comfortable. Now I make it a habit of going to a variety of meetings.
