I  know I'm day 4- but someone had recommended downloading This Naked Mind from the sidebar for free. I  had done so months in the past and struggled with finding the time and motivation to read the thing (an excuse I  know). ..I'd like to plug the alternative- if you can part with the money- or you already use audible- the audiobook. I  spent a credit on the audiobook version and started listening to it on my way to work today. I  am immediately more interested in the content that I'm hearing versus having to find the time to sit down and read. ..Just sayin.

I use Audible as well. I just purchased Allan Carrs book. I hear they are similar. Will probably purchase This Naked Mind as well. 
I listened on Audible as well. It has been immensely helpful. 
Also listening on Audible. Totally worth the money spent.
Ooooooo. I'll have to get it on Audible. Thanks!!
Am I missing something? I followed the link in the sidebar to the free version of This Naked Mind but the link sends me to the Author's website where the download is the first *chapter* free. I'd like to check it out but I don't have audible either.
