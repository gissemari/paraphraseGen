Saturday afternoon and our (husband and I) usual routine of a few drinks in the back garden while the kids zoom around before (a lot of) wine with dinner once they've gone to bed. I haven't drunk or even WANTED to since Tuesday. Just got to keep my head on straight for the next few hours and enjoy being a) hangover free and b) freshly excited about being sober..IWNDWYT

There's a whole world of interesting and fancy beverages out there that *don't* contain alcohol... Pick one!..All you have to do is dodge that first glass of Vino Collapso and make it through until bedtime!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;

Good for you IWNDWYT 
I had the same ritual...hard to break it. I started mixing chilled seltzer/soda water with raspberry vinegar in a wine glass. Looks like a rose fruity no calories and I can sip it from a wine glass. Helped me immensely. 
Habits and rituals are tough to break. We ware people of routine and the booze wrote directed and starred in our routines. ..  My advice is to do something engaging for those few hours to keep your mind busy. Maybe call some folks you haven't talked to in a while. Some family maybe. Read a book. Go for a jog. 
I did it! Snuggled up in bed with Annie Grace and loads of chocolate :).Bring on Day 5!!
