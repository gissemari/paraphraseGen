I've been a high functioning alcoholic for 10 or so years. For the last 3 years I've been lying to my wife about the extent and location of my drinking (saying I'm walking to the bar for a drink or two and actually getting some drinks for home and hiding them/lying about it)...Last Monday I finally admitted to my wife what I had been doing/hiding. It suck(s)/(ed) but it was necessary. She asked me to stay in a hotel this weekend (because of the breach of trust) and it's turned into just a helluva bender :(..I'm about to seriously pursue outpatient rehab for the first step. AA kinda turns me off with the whole religious spin but I think it may really help. Either way I'm struggling and just need to share what's going on with me...I'm really worried about sharing what's going on with my friend/family because I have A LOT of shame around it...Either way wish me luck with seeking rehab I'm terrified but I know it's one of the best gifts I can give myself.

Being able to function while killing yourself with booze is a bitch. There is no waking up in a gutter homeless rock bottom story. You just die in a more expensive bed. I'm in the same boat. I do what I have to do but none of the things I should do. Hit me up anytime. You aren't alone in this. I'm just starting my sobriety battle as are many others. 
I am glad you are here!
How wonderful that you don't have to lie anymore. Everything from here will be up. Stopping drinking has been one of the best choices i've ever made I have no regrets and I never wake up feeling awful about hiding my use having a hangover piecing together the previous night. Stay the course it's worth it.
