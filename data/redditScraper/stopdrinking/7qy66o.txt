This is a throwaway. Hi I've lurked here before. So recently I decided to really try to stop drinking. I've had a problem for about seven years and been with my boyfriend for five. I tried so hard this time for two months the longest I've ever gone and I relapsed. I am still getting back on the wagon. My boyfriend got more upset than I've ever seen him when I was drinking all the time and hiding it from him. This was yesterday. Today he left work at one and drank until five. I picked him up from the bar and he was shit faced. He yelled at me screaming at the top of his lungs things that didn't really make sense and calling me a bitch and breaking things. Before he finally left again which I tried to make him stop repeatedly but he just kept screaming so I had to let him go he said when I get back this will still be my apt and that isn't a choice for you. I'm so hurt and heartbroken. I know he is too.  I just need some support because I can't talk to anyone and I'm terrified he's gonna start a fight with someone or end up in jail. I have apt neighbors and I'm sure they heard everything. I feel so awful. Do I go look for him if he doesn't come home?

Yikes that sounds rough. From what you've described I'd say it's best if you give him space. Maybe call his friends and see if he's with them or if they can find him. If you run into him now it may escalate the situation. It's just my two cents I hope that things work out though. 
Alcohol is poison for relationships.  If you want to stop drinking get help.  I couldn't stop by myself.
