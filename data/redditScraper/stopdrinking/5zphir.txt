I was lucky enough to score a good job and have been busy but coming up on two months it's been hard. My meeting attendance compared to the first month has been terribly lower and I haven't read literature.. I've said no to many friends and colleagues about drinking but know I'm nearly not as active right now. Anyone else go through this? I know I need to go to meetings but it's just not happening lately. Any tips?

After 2 rehabs and lots of meetings during the first one I too feel the same way. I don't feel like drinking but I do feel exhausted of always having this on my mind. Frankly I've been super lazy and unmotivated lately also don't feel too much like being social right now. At least if it involves talking about booze and problems. ..I'm on the fence about going this weekend but I'll probably push myself to it just to get out know you're not alone in feeling this way! 
I have heard and also feel that if you don't feel like going to a meeting that you should go to a meeting. 
Not advocating this but I haven't gone to one meeting this whole time I've been sober. Frankly I am too busy but I keep myself entertained with work and reddit :P that and school takes up literally every second I have so I can't drink if I want to graduate. I will say that I clung to this sub the first month but as my life started to improve I gradually came here less. Maybe it's the same with you for meetings? Take pride in your sobriety by even the smallest measures.   Going to bed sober is perhaps the most passive action one can take as we need sleep but it's probably the most important thing you can do! If you ever feel like you need someone and can't make a meeting come here. This place keeps me in check
