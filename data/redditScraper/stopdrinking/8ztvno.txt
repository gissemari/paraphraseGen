Tonight I'm going to a barbecue with my daughter's class and all the parents. In previous years I would drink myself silly  on these occasions. Tonight I'm remaining sober. It's day two of my new start. I thought about postponing the quitting moment because of tonight's barbecue but I didn't: I quit yesterday after I suddenly realized I was actively killing myself. Wish me luck. The previous few times I quit it didn't last. This time I'm going to bombard this sub (ok with moderation although moderation has never been a talent of mine :) with my thoughts and struggles I'm hoping this will help me and hopefully maybe someone else too.

Well maybe staying sober tonight might save you and your daughter a potentially  embarrassing moment. Especially if they have a kareoke machine...lol.
Just walked out of an class with a 16 year old. We were talking about his parents and he started telling me his Dad drinks daily. His English is halting but in the few sentences he managed to string together I could feel his fear about his Dad's drinking. It was a powerful reminder to me as an adult about how kids feel when we drink. It destabilises them. I know you can do better than that. Good luck!
Good for you! That's the reason I quit. I was slowly killing myself. I've been binge reading gruesome stories about how terrible alcohol is for health. It's helping me to wake up every day and not be frightened that I'll see yellow eyes staring back at me in the mirror. Good luck!
good start !
