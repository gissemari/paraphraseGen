So I've got 23 days sober and a woman that I've been seeing for the past few months just broke up with me.  I really liked spending time with her but I felt like a fraud the entire time.  She knew I didn't drink but not about my struggle with alcoholism.  It a huge part of my life that's difficult to talk to people about...I realize that I need to make sobriety my number one priority.  Had I gotten deeper into a relationship with this person I would of been setting myself up for a relapse had something gone wrong...She did me a favor...

You've got to take care of yourself first. If you weren't ready to open up with her it would either lead you down the wrong path or end up in the same place it is now. Today might be hard but tomorrow will be slightly easier. We're all on the same journey and rooting for you. ..IWNDWYT
Good to see you're taking this the right way - positively. Prioritizing investing in yourself is never wrong. If nothing else your future relationships will be more genuine and your SO will get to know the real you not the you controlled by alcohol. Good luck friend! Have faith in what's to come. IWNDWYT 
Maybe leave it a while until you start dating again? I spent 5 years on my own  trying to figure out how what kind of person I was working on my sobriety (I have periods on and off booze) and why I kept being attracted to the wrong big sort of person. They were good years for what it's worth?
