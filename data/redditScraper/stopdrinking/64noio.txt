Back story got to almost 10 months sober. Was so happy and proud of myself. I've been moving house and that triggered a relapse. I didn't get black out drunk (I lie I did the first time cause I wanted too) because I didn't set myself out to get that way and it made me realize I could drink now. I'm more mature and young so maybe I just needed that 10 months of clarity. ..But yet when I was drinking I was not in complete control and I have always hated that feeling. I think that's why I need to be blackout drunk or not drink at all. I can't beat this addiction right now thinking I'm so smart and shit. I'll be buying a bottle after work maybe and I don't know why I'm like this. Self-sabotage and just a sad idiot. The only thing that makes me feel better is the bloody thing making me feel sick. ..I just can't go down this road like I used to but I've already drank the last 2 nights/days in a row. ..Sorry for complaining. The answer is so obvious don't drink yet I just c.a.n.t

I could stop I just couldn't stay stopped.   Getting into recovery I learned about the obsession.  Reach out for help.
I got help because I had no clue how to do it on my own. It was easier and more fun to be sober with the help of a therapist and AA.
This IS a "we" program after all. 
Thanks guys. I see now that I do need to go to AA
