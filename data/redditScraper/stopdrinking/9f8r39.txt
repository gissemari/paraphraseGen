Firstly I apologize for asking for help/support/advice so many times on here and thank you all for your comments..I have been in A&amp;E twice in the last week - first time for alcohol withdrawal symptoms (shaking all over and my family thought I was going to have a seizure) then the next day when I overdosed on prescription meds. It was not a serious attempt to end my life but a ridiculous way of me trying to get some sleep. I am so ashamed of upsetting my family like that..I have now got an appointment for an addiction assessment but it is still a week away. I have been advised to continue drinking until then but I am really struggling with this. Alcohol is making me feel so ill and am scared if I drink too much I won't be able to stop again..I know that no one can give medical advice but any experiences of waiting for detox would be so much appreciated thanks.

Well I did have a seizure so I think maybe the continuing to drink normally until you are assessed is a good idea.  I was lucky that it happened in rehab and was laid down on my peers as I was about to fall out of a chair possibly hit my head.  I was 5 days sober at the time when it happened too 4 days in ER for extremely low sodium due to kidneys and liver working poorly then one night at rehab and it happened the next day.  I actually didn't even have shakes or anything that day.  They took me off librium because 5 days was "past major withdrawal concerns" then I didn't really sleep the night before then it just happened after dinner.  I have no recollection of it remember sitting down full after dinner and doing a crossword puzzle next thing I knew I woke up surrounded by paramedics confused as all hell...How soon is the detox?  If it's within a week or so I would probably just drink enough so you don't feel like shit but not go crazy and get shitfaced if I could.  If it's longer I'd definitely call professionals for a better plan.
I attended AA daily while I waited for my detox appointment.
