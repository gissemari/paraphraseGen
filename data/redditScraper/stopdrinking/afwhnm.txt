I had a big victory over the weekend.  My work held their holiday party on Friday night.  Open bar... (don't need to explain the struggles this can manifest)..Last year at this time this is where I slipped.  I had about 7 months under my belt.  Went to this party and drank and the whole cycle started again I was drinking daily about  6 weeks later.  Until I finally quit in July...Well this year.  I went to the party and ordered an iced tea in a pint glass.  Got one question on what I was drinking right when I ordered the drink... after that nobody said anything.  I went about my night chatting with coworkers playing ping pong and shuffleboard...&amp;#x200B;..I left around 10:30pm (the party started at 6pm).  A bunch of others were going to another place but I decided to opt out on that as some were already getting pretty sloppy.  ..&amp;#x200B;..Big victory for me.  Not saying it is smooth sailing going forward but the stage is set for things to be easier at least until spring.   ...168 days today and IWNDWYT.

Success! I also had my office party on Friday and managed to stick with Kombucha and then left early. My husband commented that it didn't seem like I struggled at all...he must have missed all my glances toward the wine table.
