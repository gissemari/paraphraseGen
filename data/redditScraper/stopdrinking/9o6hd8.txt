Am on day 15 but really struggling emotionally. i spent the weekend sober and went out and did activities went to the cinema on Sat night and met a friend for coffee today. It felt empty though and i really missed the buzz of being out there i felt alive in one way and active but also dead and boring in another. i also have some form of social anxiety i think which i just cant reconcile almost dysmorphic feeling of shame. I fear my struggle is going to be harder than most .. i can feel the substances starting to reel me back in :(

I started going to meetings at 14 days - I knew I needed some 'real life' accountability. ..I had horrible anxiety when I got sober - undiagnosed PTSD -  so I promise recovery is possible.
