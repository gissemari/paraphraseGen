I'm 678 days clean and sober. I never had a drinking problem...drugs were my problem. But I am in a professional program that requires 5 years of strict sobriety...I'm tested randomly at least weekly for random things and I never know what I am tested for...blood hair urine nail it's a crap shoot. Failure would mean loss of my career.  I'm required to stay sober from drugs alcohol and any meds that could be slightly mood altering including benadryl cold meds and most prescriptions. The only OTC meds I'm allowed are NSAIDs Tylenol and antihistamines like Zyrtec or Claritin. Prescription meds are even stricter. Alcohol was never my DOC so it hasn't been hard not drinking. But recently every night I'm having drinking dreams. Things like sipping a beer (which I've *always* hated) having a glass of wine whatever. And I'm waking up in a panic feeling like I actually relapsed and drank. I don't know where this is coming from. It takes hours to shake the fear and horror of the dream and it's draining me. Again at most prior to this program I had a glass of wine a few times a month max. It's never been my thing. But I've stayed clean and sober almost 700 days and I don't get why I'm dreaming about drinking rather than at least dreaming about drugging which was my struggle. Now I've certainly occasionally missed being able to have a glass of whatever on a special occasion but since it wasn't my bag it has not been hard giving it up...since it was never my thing. Anyone have any insight into why I'm plagued with these dreams? They are seriously upsetting and drag me down emotionally for hours in the mornings. I have not relapsed on any of my forbidden substances and when I'm awake the craving isn't there either. Just during my sleep for the past month. And they have only been alcohol dreams. IWNDWYT.

Wow that is some career you must have. I have been having the drinking dreams this week as well. My first but still disturbing when I think I have wrecked my sober life.  Wishing you peace on this wonderful day. IWNDWYT
I'm trying to imagine what you do for a job!! Yikes...First congratulations on your amazing almost 700 days. I wouldn't sweat the fact you're dreaming about alcohol in particular. It sounds like you're having classic anxiety dreams -- like the ones I still get about waking up in a college exam with one credit left to graduate not having studied .....Can you talk to a therapist? I bet talk therapy would be very effective for something like this. Switching up your exercise routine might also help break the cycle. Good luck!
