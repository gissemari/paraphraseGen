I'm really seeing how much of an effect alcohol had on me. Since quitting I have seen a lot of health benefits...Unfortunately it seems alcohol was relieving some stress. Now my dentist is saying I have been grinding my teeth and this is a recent issue. They didn't say anything 6 months ago which is just a bit before I quit. I believe it is related...I have a night guard now and I am trying to relieve stress but I have to admit... I'm struggling guys/gals. I don't want to drink and I don't want to be stressed out...Anyone else experience this? I cannot be the only one. What did you do for it?

Interesting. I didn't put it together until I read your post but yes this is happening to me too. When I was drinking I only needed my nightguard occasionally. Now I'm grinding my teeth so much even during the day! that sometimes I can't eat. That sounds crazy but it's happening. I am using the nightguard religiously and it is helping. There are jaw stretches that help too. 
I do as well...have a nightguard too. I have had mornings when I have woken up with a headache from grinding. Nightguard helps but I admit to not being as disciplined as I should be in wearing it...
I hate my nightguard. I never wear it so I grind my retainer thinner than the nightguard. Ugh maybe this thread will inspire me to try it again.
Yes absolutely. I got headaches from grinding in addition to damage to my teeth. The night guard prevents he damage but doesn't correct or prevent the grinding or clenching. My dentist has advised me stay with me here to get Botox in my jaw and an area in my temples to prevent the grinding.
