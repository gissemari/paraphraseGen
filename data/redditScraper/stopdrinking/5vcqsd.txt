I have been drinking mostly heavy for about 15 years.  Although I'm not quite as bad as I used to be it was mostly an upward progression.  I have known for probably a good 5 years that it was time to quit for so many reasons I don't need to elaborate.  I wonder why then I have ignored all the logic and have countlessly put myself in terrible situations which could have irrevocable consequences.  It's like I have watched the movie with a terrible ending in my head so many times but never really accepted it.  I think that's changing now and I want to stop drinking.  But I fear a few weeks months or years from now (however long I can maintain this)  I will ignore the horrible potential consequences again.  Maybe I won't be so lucky next time.  Anybody else feel like this?

answer: addiction ..if it was easy we wouldn't be here...i was able to take a very clear look at my life once i stopped drinking though. i realized that i didn't want to live like that anymore. took it day by day since then. 
I felt like you describe for years. I knew I drank too much often made bad choices while under the influence or hungover. Took chances damaged relationships was a poor employee and a shitty spouse. ..Not at all logical but the thing is addiction isn't as simple as "I logically should not drink so much". Addiction rewires the brain to over ride all logic and drink despite negative consquences. Eventually I found that the only way to get this in order was to stop drinking completely and work on the issues that were underlying my abuse of alcohol. Along the way I learned that I really enjoy life sober.
