Hi all..Going through a break-up and I want and need to stop drinking.  On day 4 after a 6-month relapse after a few years sober.  My mind has been fixated on having a drink today to  help  with the roller coaster of emotions and drown the immense guilt I feel.  Obviously I know it will not help but my brain is dead-set on telling me otherwise.  How do you combat moments like these?

I literally take things minute by minute and any distractions if possible really help me. Hang in there!
Grab a fizzy non-alcoholic drink turn on a movie go for a walk call a friend play a game read a book grab a bite to eat play it forward in your mind do ANYTHING to get your mind off it until the craving passes which it will. Remind yourself how great you are and this is your journey and you're strong enough to make it through this. Best of luck to you and IWNDWYT!
I do a few things:..Read/comment here.Listen to one of my stop drinking audio books.Occupy my mind by researching something for work..Carbonated beverages and creamsicles have been helping to curb my cravings..
I am in the same position. My partner left me because of my drinking. I'm using this shitty situation as an opportunity to grow and learn from my mistakes. I cried for the first 6 days and allowed myself to feel these raw emotions. I also wrote down how I was feeling throughout the day took lots of bath to calm my anxiety reached out to friends and most importantly I didn't drink.  Drinking will just delay the healing process. We will get though this. Be kind and gentle with yourself.
