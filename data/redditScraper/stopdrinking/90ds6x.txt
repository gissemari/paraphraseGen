I am struggling.  I found a place in Albion Michigan called Awakenings Rehabilitation that I am going to next Tuesday.  Many of you have said keep trying and that's what I am going to do.  I just need more help.  Many of you have made it.  This gives me hope.  I know that you don't know who I am but I am asking you to pray for this stranger who struggles with addiction like you.  I am asking you to pray that God will give me the wisdomstrength and his peace to get through this process..Thanks to you all and God bless you..Julie

I am back home now.  I have 60 days of sobriety on which to build on now.
