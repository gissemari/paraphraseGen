And it's getting tough.  I just want a fucking beer...And I've gone to enough meetings and fucking therapy sessions to know that it's shit thinking and it's never just one and 'play the tape' and all that.  I'm just struggling every day to remind myself.

Are you working with a sponsor on the steps? That helped me more than anything.
I'm sorry you're struggling.  One thing that you wrote that I know myself *it's never just one*.  I fortunately haven't had any urges recently but I know I had to change what I was doing at the time.  I remember cleaning out drawers taking a shower going for a walk etc. any diversion to change my "stickin' thinkin'".  I still try and remember why I stopped in the first place.  Hang in there You're doing good.  Blessings to YOU!
You want a beer and instead you posted here! Seems like considerable Progress! Way to go!
Someone else on this site said "Of course you want a drink. You're an alcoholic and it's been a while since you've had one." It helped me to have it stated so plainly. Plus it made me realize that if learning to live sober was so easy it wouldn't be such an accomplishment.
I remember that this was a very tough time for me. I feel like that was when the focus shifted from simply not drinking to facing all of the crap it covered up and I really just wanted to escape it for a while. What I've learned is that escaping never fixes the reasons I need to...It's hard but stay strong. It takes time to clear out the mess that drinking makes in your life but it sounds like you're doing a lot of work on it. And if you need reminders we're always here.
