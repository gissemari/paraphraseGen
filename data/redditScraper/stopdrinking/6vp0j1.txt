I drink a lot. I'm wasting a lot of money and my life but I keep drinking. Sometimes it's great and I feel great and to a certain point I'm more comfortable with being me but every morning I wake up feeling shitty and tell myself I won't drink tonight but I end up eventually in my room drinking glasses of rum. I just discovered this sub so that's positive but I struggle to take this problem seriously.

It's difficult to move forward until you do. I'd venture to guess the vast majority of this sub has been there. 
Yeah I spent 10 or so years in the place you describe. I wasn't ready to quit until I was...ready. The morning depression and anxiety eventually outweighed the evening's happy buzz (which most of the time just devolved into a tired drunk mess by 7pm). 
I Understand...You might want to peruse some posts from our friend U/Slipacre. ..He has a weekly post about unanticipated and undesired consequences..
