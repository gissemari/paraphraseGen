I am again back at a solid Day One. It feels like the millionth time. I just requested a badge reset this morning and I noticed that previously I was still apparently at 188 but not really. And that is how it usually happens. I'll take a strong stab a sobriety reach out for support (checking in on here and I have been to AA). But then that'll stop and I'll start drinking again and then be too embarrassed and ashamed to make it back...I'm only 24 and been struggling with alcohol and sobriety for several years now and have stretches of several months of sobriety but then pick up and again. This past weekend I binged again Friday and all day Saturday and often when I do I forego basically everything else including eating. So yesterday I was spent the whole day just recovering on the couch getting down whatever food I could and today I am back at work but definitely do not feel like myself...I just wanted to type this up quickly before getting off my lunch break and getting back to work. I am looking forward to reaching out and checking in on here much more than I have before. I've always loved how supportive this community is.

Welcome back! Thanks for your courage to share relapse.
Yes love and support is here  good going getting right back on with sobriety . I won't drink  with you today 
You knew coming into this that it wouldn't be easy but you started on that first "day one" because it was what you knew you had to do for the sake of yourself and the ones you love. Get right back up on the horse.
