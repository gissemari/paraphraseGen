Stopped drinking about 8 months ago for 67 days. In those 67 days I was irritable and had zero ambition to do anything but lay in bed or sit on the couch. Eventually it turned into depression and I relapsed. With a drink in my hand I would be up for anything. Now I'm back on the wagon for good but I'm dreading the irritably and laziness. Any tips?

Perhaps seeing a doctor for an assessment for depression is something to consider.
I got a lot of support fellowship tools and methods to handle irritation and resentments at meetings...Tried any?..Very helpful to me just for this reason!
Been to a meeting or 2. They help with the not drinking part. Next week I'm getting into an outpatient program. Maybe they can tweak my meds. 
My first impression is that irritability may be an underlying condition that was just under wraps during the drinking years. Now you have to discover the cause. The lassitude can be cured. MAKE yourself get off the couch and do things. 
Partner up with your doctor and be honest with them
