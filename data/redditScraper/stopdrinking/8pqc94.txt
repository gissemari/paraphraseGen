*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*..**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**..I'm pledging myself to not drinking today and invite you to do the same...Maybe you're new to r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others...It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours lets not drink alcohol!..\_ \_ \_..**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!..What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up...**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning...**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread...\_ \_ \_..This post goes up at:..    US - Night/Early Morning  .    Europe - Morning  .    Asia and Australia - Evening/Night..A link to the current Daily Check\-In post  can always be found near the top of the sidebar...\_ \_ \_..Please welcome [u/idkmyname\_\_77](https://www.reddit.com/user/idkmyname__77) as she takes the check\-in reins next week as we gallop (or trot or canter or wildly buck) together down the path of sobriety!..Here's a double\-thought for my last post this go\-round:..&gt;"Time is an equal opportunity employer.  Each human being has exactly the same number of hours and minutes every day.  Rich people can't buy more hours.  Scientists can't invent new minutes.  And you can't save time to spend it on another day.  Even so time is amazingly fair and forgiving.  No matter how much time you've wasted in the past you still have an entire tomorrow."  .&gt;  .&gt;Denis Waitley..New leaves and right times and being who you want to be and changing with all your heart and entire tomorrows.  But mostly:  ***It's never too late to be who you want to be.***..&gt;"Beauty is not who you are on the outside it is the wisdom and time you gave away to save another struggling soul like you."  .&gt;  .&gt;Shannon L. Alder..YOU ARE ALL BEAUTIFUL.  This community has radiant beauty.  This place is a lifesaver.  This sub is holy.  We are all equals; we will all make a choice today.  It is my honor to pledge my choice to you:..I do not drink; therefore I will not drink with you today...\-K\_SS

Sobriety is pretty fun. Saturday looks like a cold rainy Seattle day. Previously a ticket to just sit around and drink all day. Now I'm excited to see a friend in town and make some decent progress on a handful of projects currently going on. IWNDWYT

Thanks for hosting K_ss you beautiful person   I had a nice night last night one of my buddies said he'd cut his drinking way down because it made him feel really anxious and another told me he was quitting playing video games because he just wasted all his time on that. Drove home safely and went to sleep at 10:30. Feels good :) I will not drink with you today   
I'm off swimming this morning and then for brunch. IWNDWYT

Saturday without a hangover. Time to be productive!
IWNDWYT   
Happy Saturday! Feeling grateful to wake up sober this morning and also that my fianc  did not drink as well last night. I try my best to not push him towards sobriety because I feel if you want it you have to do it yourself so I'm feeling glad that my actions might be influencing him to be a bit healthier...Today I will not drink. I am going to get my hair cut and then have my wedding hair trial and go and pick up our wedding rings.
IWNDWYT 
5am getting ready for work. I will not drink today with you.

I had to stop Campral. Friday was my first full day without it. I don't know if this is why or not but the pains my social life are causing me felt heavier. I was tempted to drink. I didn't and I won't on saturday either. IWNDWYT

Good morning and happy Saturday! Thanks for some really great check-in posts u/K_SomethingSomething! This sub is a holy life-saving place. ..IDK what the deal is but this whole past week I've been struggling with longing to drink and this after having such a good Memorial Day weekend and feeling like I was starting the summer off so strong. I'll just remain vigilant I guess and know that some days and some weeks are just easier than others. Everyone have a great Saturday. I will not drink with you today!
Saturday of a full weekend with the family is always tough for me not to drink but I'm going to go for a 4-5 mile run before they wake up. And I will not drink with you today.

I will not drink with you today!
My first non-hungover Saturday in I don't know how long. This feels amazing. Hanging with friends sober last night was wonderful; I was able to really enjoy everything and stay present and I was with close friends so I was able to keep my anxiety in check without booze. I have several parties to attend to tonight and I'm excited to say I will NOT drink with y'all today!!!
Not drinking today. Heading up to Petoskey Michigan for an open house. Looking forward to going which is something I haven't thought in a long time. Be good to yourself SD'ers! 
I will not drink today!
I will not drink today in order to have a calm and peaceful Saturday in the sun.

I stayed up until 3am last night which was stupid because now I'm up bright and early with my kids. I always try to squeeze as much time out of my night after I'm done with my shift at work each day.

Thank you for the quotes K\_ IWNDWYT
I'm happy to say IWNDWYT! 
Had my first real challenging situation yesterday. Traveling. I used to always drink in the airport bars. I had a couple Diet Cokes instead. 
IWNDWYT.
Today marks a milestone for me.  It has now been four complete weeks since I consumed alcohol.  This is now the longest time I've ever stayed sober outside of a rehab facility and I'm doing it by myself no meds no one monitoring me.  I feel great and I'm so proud of myself.  Happy Saturday folks.
Checking in. Going on a date later with my super supportive husband. Hope to find a yummy restaurant with a sparkling lemonade drink and then going to an art museum. Perfect night planned with no booze needed! 
I will not drink with you all today. 
Good morning from the Mississippi Gulf Coast! I will not drink with you today

Not today 
I went to a concert last night and I didn't drink! I remember the show and feel great this morning!! IWNDWYT! 
As the Rascals once sung..."It's a beautiful morning" I am so thankful to get through another bartending shift without drinking. Last week I wrote about making a plan to transition out of the industry so the "its never to late" part is particularly important to me today. I will try and remember that tonight as I also remember that I do not drink; therefore I will not drink with you tonight. Good luck everyone together we got this.
I will not drink with you today  
Two weeks! I will not drink today!
Woke up with a headache but it was just because of a stiff neck. I don't have to feel weird and ashamed about when I'm headachey and wonder why I didn't stop sooner last night because I never started. Glad I'm going to continue that and not drink with you all today. 
Still feeling low &amp; tired. Got a good sleep Hubby's home to help with the kids &amp; we're gonna go to some open houses today! To think it was only a little less than 2 months ago I was looking at apartments &amp; wondering how I was going to manage being a single mom. .Just goes to show how bad the alcohol was messing me up &amp; how strong me &amp; Hubby's relationship ship is! .So happy to be here &amp; not drinking with any of you!  
I will not drink with you today!
IWNDWYT 
I will not drink with you today.

Not drinking today!
Afternoon from the UK! Thanks for hosting this week K_SS - I love your writings in the morning!   Not much to say today - I've just had a nanna nap and have to get moving! .I will not drink with you today   
I'm feeling shitty today. Physically mentally emotionally. I'm unemployed and living with my parents and finding it really hard to change that. BUT I woke up early to help my brother with a big chore  and now i'm gonna go to the gym and then sit at a cafe and send off some resumes. Definitely wouldn't be doing any of that if I were drinking and I would feel even shittier. Won't drink today.
I will not drink with you on this gorgeous Saturday!!!
Day 1 after yet another miserable relapse.  Feeling pretty damn low but not low enough to quit trying apparently.  So I will not drink with you today.
I will not drink with you all today
I will not drink with you today.
I will not drink or use today. 
I will not drink with you today 
IWNDWYT    
This place really is holy: no way would I have strung together this many dry days without everyone here. Thank you for hosting this week K_SS and I will not drink with you today.
I'm nearing two years haven't posted here in a while but still sober! I won't drink with you all today! Happy sober Saturday. 
Day 2 feeling giod optimistic. I womt let a  crappy day at wotk be an excuse. I wont let boredom be an excuse. I will let my antidepressants do their job isntead of depressing them. I will not drink with you today.
I will not drink with you today!
Iwndwyt!  
Checking in! IWNDWYT.
Another wonderful Saturday. Finals are stressful but I'm counting my blessings. I'm alive healthy and sober!.I will not drink with you today!
Had a simple and calm Friday night - took a walk with friends made dinner fell asleep watching a movie. It meant I was able to get up this morning and go for a run. I was trying to meet up with a local sober run club but couldn't find them - still ran though! I'll look for the run club next Saturday...This is my second weekend and I have lots of plans to keep busy. ..IWNDWYT!! Have a wonderful weekend everyone.
IWNDWYT!!
I'm here. IWNDWYT
I will not drink with anyone today. Yesterday was a bit rough but I did not drink. I am grateful to not be hung over today!
I will not drink with you today!
Iwndwyt
Slather me up in peppermint oil it's a Saturday night party! I'm so excited to be here...IWNDWYT.
Not today.
Up early feeling great. Took my best friend out for breakfast. Came home to find hubby is feeling hungover and doesn't want to do anything. Slightly depressing but I've been in his shoes many times and it reinforces my resolve to not drink with you all today!   
Happy Saturday. Thanks for being here everyone. IWNDWYT
I will not drink today.
Woke up in a panic this morning because I didn't know what time it was couldn't remember the night before and thought I had slipped up and missed the first part of my work day. Then... Realized it was Saturday I fell asleep after watching tv with my boyfriend late and I wasn't hungover because I haven't drank in over a month. Went back to sleep to catch up on all the early mornings I've been having this week and now it's a beautiful day (the weather forecast was rain all weekend)..Happy Saturday SD. I won't be drinking today - I don't want a future scare to be real. 
I will not drink with you today!
I will not drink today 
I will not drink with you today!
Sending you so much love /u/K_SomethingSomething. Thank you for the beautiful prompt...I have very slowly been repairing my life rehabilitating myself a little each day. I still have a ways to go but today I am struck by how very unmanageable my life would be were I still drinking and using. I presently work 3 part\-time jobs and am a caretaker for my grandfather and grandmother. I absolutely could not have done any of this if I was still active in my addiction nor would I have chosen to. All I cared about was getting fucked up. My confidence is still shaken and my self\-esteem low after 7 years of heavy drinking but I with each right action I am moving in the direction of wholeness. Today I choose to make decisions that bring me closer to be who it is I want to be...I wish everyone a wonderful Saturday. I will not drink with y'all today.
My first Saturday not hungover in I don't know how long! Again was tough to get this far today as my head is beginning to play even more tricks on me! But I am her I am sober and I will remain sober. It will be one week tonight since my last drink and I didn't think that would be possible without some sort of rehab. Guess I underestimated the power of my conscious mind to fight my unconscious mind! I can do this. I do not drink; therefore I will not drink with you today 
Iwndwyt
No drinking today or the next 24hrs.
First day 9 since high school. I will not drink with you today! 
Right it's 7.15pm and I can finally pledge for the day after just going to the shop and getting pizza chips Ben &amp; Jerry's and Coca Cola instead of two bottles of wine. I've been in here several times today to pledge but wasn't confident I'd keep to it so didn't. It's only day two but it's been a bit of a rough one. I will not drink tonight. 
I will not drink with you today.  Day 1.
Been struggling with pop urges/cravings. Just drove by a liquor store and mentally parked went in and bought a shooter. Then I physically shuddered at the thought. Tempted or not it ain't happening today. I will not drink with you today.
IWNDWYT! Hung out with friends last night and drank La Croix. Smoked a lot of cigarettes. Does anyone else still feel hungover after smoking all night? It sucks. 
today i am grateful for family. ..i will not drink with you today. 
one more day
I will not drink today!
I won't drink today. 
i will not drink with you all today. no matter what. 
Day 12. For some reason today feels harder than all of the others. Woke up feeling like continuing to put in the effort isn't as worth it as it felt like 2 weeks ago. Which is ridiculous.... it's only day 12. I know that this is just the alcohol part of my brain talking... it's also pointing me at other things that aren't working in my life and making me want to do something so I don't have to look at those things. ..Today might be hard which is why I'm checking in. It's hard to say this and I'm afraid that I won't pull it off but more than anything I want to say that IWNDWYT. 
Thanks for hosting this week K_SS! I will not drink with you today.
Hi everyone. I'm not drinking today...Thanks K_SS for hosting the check in this week.
I'm not going to drink today!
Yesterday was my birthday. Relapsed. Today is a good day as any to start. IWNDWYT
Struggled more today but I've pushed through it and I've made that promise to myself. IWNDWYT 
No ethanol poison for me today thank you!
Checking in with twenty days under my belt.  After today will be three weeks!  I will not drink with all of you today!  :)
I'm not gonna be drinkin today . 
Traveling a lot for work anyone have any online meetings they recommend? English speaking please. 
I wont drink today!
Check in
It's my first Saturday so 2 meetings today -- I can't stand open stretches of free time. I won't drink today.
Oh two weeks! It's so good to be here. This is when a bunch of the awesome parts of being sober kick in AND my more intense cravings amp up and it's self confidence vs self sabotage 24/7. Thanks SD. Just focus on today. IWNDWYT 
IWNDWYT 
Checking in!.
Day 2 - I managed to go to a full day social event where everyone else was drinking and I stuck to water. One day victories! IWNDWYT
i will not drink with you today!!!
Checking in  60th day today. Never thought I would make it this far. Husband brought home a 30 pack last night and I didn't give in. Sad that he broke another promise that he was going to quit  happy that I'm still here. IWNDWYT!
I will not drink with you all today or tonight  
Not drinking today.
Should I quit drinking? I see no benefits from it. Everything that is achieved with it at social gatherings is possible sover. I'm don't drink much but I feel like I could be a better person if I quit it.
IWNDWYT
Happy Cake Day to Me!  Still not drinking today...
Day number 6 I will not drink today! I will not drink with you today
Today I made the decision to drink again because I was going to one of the biggest events of the year. My original goal was to cut down on my drinking (which I've successfully done) not to quit entirely...I didn't even have much to drink (3 pints and a shot much MUCH less than I'd usually have in 1 night) but it wasn't worth it at all. I could have gotten through the night sober. Nothing I did required me to be under the influence of alcohol...Maybe I will just quit for an extended period of time... IWNDWYT
Day 4 - made it through last night... tough time cooking delicious dinner for my wife that's when I love to drink. I made it though thankyou all who post here I was thinking about you you are how I stayed strong..I'm doing this on my own with just all of you because I don't want anyone in my life to know I'm struggling. Thankyou end of day 3 was very tough.
Thank you

I just had a great race today (rowing) and I won't drink tonight to celebrate. I will have an indulgent dinner with dessert. Tomorrow will feel just as good hangover free. Cheers

u/K_SomethingSomething you are beautifully poetic and warm and kind.  I loved your quotes today and your words all week.  I wish I had more time to spend here!  Where did this week go?!  I am together with you in not drinking.

Had a boring day. Went to the gym and made myself a new recipe with my instantpot. I applied for a volunteer position I'm interested in too. Now watching a movie with my roommate (who's having a screwdriver) but I'm staying sober and enjoying my seltzer...IWNDWYT
