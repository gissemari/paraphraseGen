This is the first time in a VERY VERY long time I have been able to maintain sobriety for this long. I have cravings every day but I am finding different ways to deal with them. Began working out again and eating better as well. It's a struggle yes but so much better than the alternative. This sub helps a lot. Thanks guys!

Unbelievable how much our lives improve when we put the bottle down. Exercise and good food to sustain the body. Then we can improve mind and spirit.
Wonderful. Well done. Let's keep going. IWNDWYT:-)
Congratulations! That's awesome. ..And if I can suggest: please go easy on yourself. ..I'm a real 'pusher'/doer of myself. So when I got sober ... Again I made a checklist of all these healthy things I should/can do along with the not drinking: eating better lift weights 3 times/week cardio meditation. ..And I found I was putting so much pressure on myself that I was creating even more anxiety than stopping alcohol created!..So finally... I just backed off. And sole focus was on sobriety that was the main thing. ..Ironically once I eased up on myself I realized I was doing all of those other things naturally because I wanted to; they felt right and healthy. NOT because I had them on a checklist that I stressed over if one went 'unchecked'. ..I'm NOT saying you're doing any of this like I did. Just wanted to share in case it might help you. ..Again congratulations! And be a good friend to yourself and your own cheerleader. You deserve it. Thomas
