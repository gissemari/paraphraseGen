Came on just to say I saw someone else recommend this book on this sub a few weeks ago and now that I have read it I have COMPLETELY lost my desire to drink. After struggling for the past two years to cut down or abstain I have been sober for several days now and it has been so EASY.  So many thanks to that redditor who lead me this way!  Good luck to those of you who read it... I hope that it can help you too!

Ditto! 
Same thing here. Heard people talk about it here. Read it. Completely changed the way I think of alcohol. I wish I could force a few people I know to read it. 
Agreed. I haven't quit completely but it's drastically changed how much and often I drink. It's weird. I'm not done reading it yet. I'm about halfway through. 
It's so weird she doesn't say anything you don't know already but I can't believe how effective it's been. I don't feel any revolutionary epiphany about drinking I just don't want to drink. It's like being normal again.
Yeah agrees so much! I read the book and just don't want to drink anymore. IWNDWYT! 
*Alcohol Explained* by William Porter is another book on the SD recommended reading list...
Glad you found it helpful!..Check out the accompanying [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4KpBxerD_BIksjUfUT4hVw/videos) too it's fab!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;

I just finished it and what a book. The whole book is filled with very smart insights about alcohol addiction. The autor is brilliant.
I'm glad you posted this! I actually just bought this book on amazon this morning after waking up from a hangover. I'm so excited to read it! 
I should re-read it it has been a year..Thanks for the reminder
I'm about halfway and am challenging myself to not have a drink until I finish it. Haven't had a drink in three weeks and just started the book a week ago after a recommendation here. 
Totally agreed. Walked into a store and knew the book would change my life didn't know how. Didn't know how much I needed to actually READ it and not just think about getting it. Got it when I joined SD...Never looking back...IWNDWYT!
She had me at 'drinking fuel ' ..I'm done!
