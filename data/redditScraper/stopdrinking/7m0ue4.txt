I have finally been fully sober for over a year. I realize now that I have the emotional intelligence of a child (okay teenager). I'm struggling here. I'm isolated. How do I grow when I hardly ever get to see or interact with anyone? I see my counselor twice a month my parents 1-2 times a week my best friend maybe once every two months. Outside of work I rarely see anybody and I only see maybe 4-6 people a day at work...I feel like I can't be myself around anyone. A lot of the habits I developed with my addict persona still rush to my aid when I feel like I need to get shit done they protect me. I can't communicate honestly with anyone I just shut down and say as little as possible. I'm so afraid of being *me*. Can anyone offer some advice or resources to supplement my counseling?..I'm taking piano lessons that's helping a lot with my memory and stuff. It's a lot of fun. I definitely suggest doing something like that to anyone needing a helping hand. Teachers are cool peoples.

Congratulations on your Solar Sober Circumnavigation!..Isolation is addiction's best friend.  ..The majority of the population in the world either don't consume alcohol or it's only a minor accompaniment at best to other primary activities.  ..I just needed to meet sober people who were caring and who were doing things...I needed to "practice" interacting with sober people...I went to meetings to find a place where *everyone there* wants to be sober and wants to help me be sober.  That gave me time to practice being sober with other people...That led to other things.  Group members did non-meeting activities such as golf lunch coffee hiking kayaking bicycle riding book clubs arts crafts and on and on.  ..That in turn led to meeting other people who weren't part of recovery but who weren't focused on drinking as the primary or secondary reason for assembling...Then I get involved with my community.  I contact United Way and they have relationships with most of the agencies in an area.  Boys and Girls Clubs homeless shelters reading for the blind Goodwill Salvation Army Big Brother/Big Sister shelters for domestic violence etc. etc.  I give a few hours.  I meet people receiving services I meet other volunteers I meet business owners philanthropists civic planners council members and similar...Then I have a rich varied network of people *whose primary driver is not alcohol*...Merry Christmas!..Whadda ya think?
