I have really enjoyed hosting the check in this week.  It's almost a sub within the sub and I think I will be here more often myself.  I enjoyed meeting new people.  Thank you! I will end up with a few of my favorite quotes or links that I have found here on SD. ../u/everydayanewday:  **Expect temptation** -- use the scouts: I read a lot here still do. We have scouts going out mapping the minefields. Some come back soon some come back later. Some make it to the frontier. And even from the frontier we get messages of stepping on mines...I haven't yet had a temptation that hasn't been covered in SD. *"If it goes this easy maybe I could just moderate" "I can have just one...or two..." "It's been so long I want to proof it doesn't have power over me anymore"*  and so many other ones. Read here and you'll be prepared. Don't let the scouts' experiences go to waste. ../u/Prevenient_Grace:  Glad you're here. Congratulations on confronting the struggle...I had to go through a couple barriers or filters or stages or whatever noun representing the membrane between one state of being and the next...I had spent years building a 'reality' in which I was invested. In which I held onto dearly. Letting go to move to the next transitional state seemed "hard" for me. I learned that nothing is hard. Nothing is easy...It. Just. Is...Hard and easy are modifiers my mind assigns to them based on what I like...What makes something "hard" is when I'm in contention with myself or my environment...If I let go of those ideas and beliefs about "how things are" and "how things should be"......if I loosen that "death grip" I have on those things...... then I can move between the membranes..... I can flow through the transitions...When I let go the struggle evaporates. Where I was exhausted before it's because I was hanging on with every fiber of my being in a tenacious wrestle with attempting to "bend" my situation into what I thought it should be rather than accepting it and figuring out how to partner with it...Surfing finally brought me the understanding...The ocean is. The ocean is not easy. The ocean is not hard. The ocean is...I can interact with it. I can rail against it. I can scream at it. I can plead with it. I can believe what I want about it...The ocean is indifferent...However if I seek to partner with the ocean I can flow with it. I have to notice the wave swells. Anticipate. Move at the right moment. Position the board in a manner that the ocean accepts. Then I have to balance. If I go to far forward on the board I fall off the crest of the wave and it crashes on top of me pushing me dragging me. If I go to far back on the board the wave moves forward without me leaving me behind...There are parts I control. Very small parts in the context of the whole. When I do my part to connect and partner with the ocean with the momentary wave then I flow with it. It carries me. It deposits me safely. Then I do it again in the next moment...I have to be open. Willing. Willing to let go...That includes everything I have believed to this point...Glad you're here. Hope you get your energy back. I go mine back when I laid down my sword and shield and walked away from the struggle...Now I seek a partnership in each moment.../u/VictoriaElaine: Maybe my addiction isn't that bad. Maybe it's that I'm so good I deserve a better life.../u/seikoholic:  The change wasn't instant; small changes in direction take time to show changes in our lives. One degree difference to the helm yields a vastly different landing a thousand miles away. ..This [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af/) is actually from r/getdisciplined but I have read it more than once and find it is very useful.  (If you were raised by parents like mine you will understand that unless you are on your deathbed there are NO ZERO DAYS.)..Another link from r/getdisciplined right [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1x99m6/im_a_piece_of_shit_no_more_games_no_more_lies_no/cf9dz72/).  Just the whole idea of playing [Bolero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZDiaRZy0Ak) as background to getting going with anything is amazingly powerful.  My kids think I am crazy playing that music through its fever-pitched crescendo...*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*. .**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**. .I'm pledging myself to not drinking today and invite you to do the same.. .Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.. .It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours lets not drink alcohol!. .---. .**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!. .What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up.. .**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.. .**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.. .---. .This post goes up at:. .    US - Night/Early Morning  .    Europe - Morning  .    Asia and Australia - Evening/Night..A link to the current Daily Check-In post  can always be found near the top of the sidebar...---

Gosh... /u/Prevenient_Grace  Now I seek partnership in each moment.  This! In those final words of that post... you can taste the exhalation and relief. Makes my own body relax in its entirety. Glad to see /u/memymomonkey likes it too! Have a great weekend all! Love you all equally but not the same! 
IWNDWYT 
Yawn!!!  It's sunny?!    .What a treat!  I slept in I'm still up kinda early and I'm not doing any drinking.      getting a good nights sleep feels awesome.  
I will not drink with you today
Thank you  Memymomonkey' for hosting the check-in this week. I didn't drink with you this past week nor will I drink with you today friend..
Thank you for this post it's quite lovely. IWNDWYT. 
I'm coming up on 7 months now and I've been flirting with the idea of seeing if I can drink "moderately" again. Even though I've been down this path about 4 or 5 times before and I know that there is no such thing as moderation for me. I will hold strong. All I have to do is not have that first drink and I know I can do that. I will not drink with you today. 
Off for an adrenaline rush at Islands of Adventure with the kiddos! IWNDWYT  
I miss surfing so much but moved away from the coast 11 years ago. But at least I'm not drinking and have no intention to today or any day from here on. Thank you for writing such a beautiful piece...IWNDWYT
I love Bolero.! I also love George Winston especially winter. I will not drink with you today this saturday of my first weekend sober in a long time. 
I will not drink today.
I will not drink today! Instead I will relax have some nice ginger ale and get ahead on schoolwork and reading for pleasure. 
Saturday morning check-in! I will not drink with you today! :)
Hope everyone is enjoying this lovely Saturday. IWNDWYT :) 
I will not fucking drink today even though I'm flying straight into a fucking mess. 
Day 4 is starting! Can't wait to go to bed again with a clear head...IWNDWYT
I will not drink today :)
Great post. I'm working on my second sober weekend and feeling really great. I will not drink with you today!
No alcohol for me today 
Going through rough time with my wife. But I will not drink today!
No drinking today or the next 24hrs!
Good morning /sd! I am always hugely appreciative of the folks who host the check-in. So much props and major bravo to you /u/memymomonkey. Thanks!!..Also I have to say this was the absolutely most perfect round-up/quote collection I've read here - just because it was the exactly right set of messages at the right moment. Plus it was awesome. Thank you again!!..IWNDWYT!
Checking in for the first time in a while. Today is 40 days for me. 
It's saturday and I'm on my 34th day. Last night I was at home. It's a new thing for me to stay at home on the weekends because I was so used at being outside...But now I realize that by staying home I get to confront myself in so many ways. ..Today I'm gonna be at home too. I'll watch some movies and the live stream of the competition of my boyfriend's robot. ..So far 34 days.....AND COUNTING...I WILL NOT DRINK WITH YOU TODAY...
Being able to quickly and with energy get up for my 7am shift at 5:30am this morning made me thankful I did not drink yesterday. Ready to do it all over again. :) ..IWNDWYT! 
IWNDWYT and I will stay under my calorie goal.
IWNDWYT!  Today is my sons 11th birthday.  Last night we had a party for his friends at a bowling alley.  I was not tempted by the bar.  We are having family over tonight for dinner.  I am not the slight bit tempted to drink tonight.  I feel so much better!  My sleep has been so darn deep!  Not waking up a sweaty bloated mess!  IWNDWYT!
Thanks for hosting Memy I will not drink with you today. 
i will not drink with you today
I've already had a full day! Between track and soccer I leave the house on 6:30am FFS! Drinking on Friday nights would be a disaster. So grateful this is no longer an issue. Ho-hum. Getting ready for the rest of this day. Chicago Fire opener is tonight and many of things in-between GO FIRE! IWNDWYT!
It is Saturday and I will not drink today! Not today not tonight- I WILL make it through the busiest day of the week and sail smoothly towards my next days off.
I will not drink today!
I will not drink with you today 
My first morning check-in since making the decision to change my sobriety date. Today is the start of my day 19! ..I'm definitely will not drink with you today! (Except for coffee. I'll totally drink coffee with you today. And actually I'm drinking coffee right now.) 
Yesterday afternoon on Facebook a good friend posted a photo of a bottle of tequila and remarked that it has been a long week for him.  I too had a long week - birthday week and I have no immediate family in the area changes at work navigating this new journey etc - and part of me misses getting ripshit on a Friday afternoon.  However I dragged my pouting self to the gym sweated out a lot of anxiety and got to hang out with my gym mates.  .  .I'm 73 days into this journey and sometimes it feels like a breeze.  **"I got this no problem."**  Some other times however it's exhausting "I can't do this."  My inner thoughts are so present and I don't have the convenience of hooch to quiet them down.  ([One of my favorite comedians has a bit about this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBWAaPPabqk))  .  .Drinking won't solve anything.  It'll just make things worse.  IWNDWYT!
I will not drink today 
It's a beautiful 75 degree sunny day in my corner. I went for a run this morning and stopped to grab a cup of coffee. As I was sipping my coffee in the sun I started thinking about how many beautiful Saturdays I have spent with drinking as the main activity - maybe even telling myself that because it was a beautiful day I should start the morning with a bottle of processco. Challenging myself to enjoy the beauty of this Saturday without the company of alcohol to minimize and blur it.
IWNDWYT
Day 2- I will not drink today..My first thought waking up was "got through yesterday just fine maybe I'll have one drink later". It's going to be a rough one but I will not drink today.

Thanks so much for hosting /u/memymomonkey!!

Ten days! I will not drink today was *really* tempted to drink yesterday after work so wanted to hit the local water hole but I resisted thanks to the folks in the iirc channel here. This morning I woke at 4:45 (normal waking time for work) got up and realize there was something important I needed to and forgot to finish at work so I showered went in and knocked it out brought home breakfast burritos worked on my road bike knocked out a 10 mile local ride and now I'm chilling with a La Croix. And it's not even Noon! None of this would have happened had I went to the bar had two beers then drove home because I definitely would have hit the liquor store  for a six pack and a couple of shooters. ..I do not regret not drinking last night for a second!..I will not drink today!
I will not drink today.
1 week and I'm feeling good. Not going to give in today either!
Feeling WRECKED this morning (long computing hour dehydration stress) but I pledge that I will not drink today to 'relax'. 
I will not drink today.
I will not drink with you today.
I will not drink today . 
I had a dream I was drinking and I was really disappointed in myself.  Woke up and realized it was just a dream!  Not drinking today.
Day 1. Seriously ready to do this.
I went almost 6 1/2 months without a drink but messed up about 2 weeks ago and started drinking almost every night again. So depressing but I am starting over again today stronger then ever. I will no drink with you today. Ready to continue on the road to freedom!
IWNDWYT!
I'm not here with you today. But I will be tomorrow. This sub helped me before and I'm hoping it can help again. 
I will not drink with you today on this perfect ski day. 
IWNDWYT!
Happy Saturday y'all i will not drink with you today. 
I will not drink today.
IWNDWYT

I will not drink today
Checkn em
iwndwyt!
Second day of wedding events and people are planning on a night out on the town. I'll be going with them but I won't be drinking! ..I made it through today and told all my old friends that I had quit drinking. Most were fairly supportive and I'm glad to have that over with. I will not drink today!
Late in the day yet I will not drink with you 
Kids are off doing their own thing hubby off doing his thing and I am counting the mintues that I haven't poured a tall glass of wine.  Lazy saturday with nothing to do what is wrong with just checking out?  Except the next morning I will find myself wondering why I do this to myself.  So I will count the mintues and I will not drink with you today. 
Long day. ..not sure if I already checked in...but in my mind. ..twice is better than none. ..I will not be drinking with you today and I will never drink again and I will never change my mind. 
And thanks!
I didn't pick up today and won't the rest of the night. 
Day 13. Emotional wreckage has hit 11 regarding my recent breakup. Caught myself in the 7-11 eyeing beer and wine because I keep seeing how much happier my ex is without me so why not dull the pain with a drink? Instead I took a handful of steps over to the soda machine got myself a big gulp and a 2 liter and went and treated myself to some enchiladas from the local Mexican place. ..IWNDWYT. 
I will not drink today.
Today is day two for me. I decided to make day two extraordinarily difficult by hosting a crawfish boil. Most of my activities or events in Louisiana are centered around drinking.  I held strong throughout the day even though my friends thought something was wrong with me and pointed out that since I wasn't drinking something serious must have happened. ..I did have a moment where I thought of the future. Would I really be able to enjoy my life without drinking? I thought of things like fishing attending parties weddings sitting around with friends late at night playing cards going on vacations football games cooking etc. It's really hard to imagine all of these events without drinking. I  know that drifting into the past or future can be discouraging. I also know that IWNDWYT. Day three starts tomorrow.   
A bit late to check in but here I am...I will not drink with y'all today!
Checking in to say I'm still here and still going strong!.Almost at the 5 week mark. Hooray!
A bit of a late check-in haven't been on Reddit a whole lot lately.  Had an awesome relaxing day.  I feel so calmly and simultaneously energized.  And I just recently passed the 2 week mark!  Love this community.
Bump in the road last night. Badge reset. Idk why I wanted to make myself feel like crap today but wanted to experiment. Hangover free is the way to be. (yes I made that rhyme)
I will not drink today.
Yesterday was a complete waste of a day. Reset :(
Tired but sober! I will not drink with you today!
I won't drink with you lovely people today!
IWNDWYT
Really struggling with cravings today. I have my Son until 2:30pm so imagine busy for now but my mind is already contemplating getting a bottle as soon as he's picked up. Today's going to be a tough one but IWNDWYT.

Good Morning SD  I will not drink with you today.  Let's keep on Rolling !! 
I will not drink with you folks today either!
This is for Sunday. IWNDWYT! 
Thank you so much for hosting the daily check in this week! I've looked forward to it every day because it has been consistently inspiring. Awesome quotes especially the one from Prevenient Grace. Such a great reminder to have an appropriate attitude toward your situation. ..And thanks to all of you for helping me through the last 60 days! This community is priceless to me. IWNDWYT!
Hello there!  On day 14 of my new non-drinker life.  It's been super easy thus far in comparison to the non-smoker life I'm struggling to get into.  It's kinda like trying to take your mind off being hungry by having gorillas beat you in the gonads with rebar.  Takes your mind off it.
Gonna go ahead and put my Sunday IWNDWYT here. Closing out 2 weeks! 
I will not drink today.
