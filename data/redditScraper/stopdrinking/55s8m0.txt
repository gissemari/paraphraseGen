This episode was on today and I thought it was a really clever metaphor for addiction. (Spoilers!) A guy with alcoholism who's in danger of losing his family hears about a miracle cure which involves him swallowing a pill. The pill ends up giving him a parasite that lives inside him and lives on alcohol so no matter how much he drinks he never gets drunk but the worm will get bigger and stronger until it kills him. If he tries to stop he goes into terrible withdrawals. The only way to deal with it he learns is to stop drinking and go through the withdrawal upon which the worm will go dormant but after that if he ever relapses it will wake up with a vengeance getting stronger each time. He will always have this worm inside him and all he can do is deny it sustenance.

Wow. Art imitates life. That's too real. 
Is that one from the original series? I'd have sworn I saw every one but I could've been drunk.
