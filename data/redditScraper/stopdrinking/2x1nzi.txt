Dont know if I feel sorry or not I'm not drinking booze or doing blow but who knows? It can be a slippery scope before the demons wake up...

What happened in November? What's in been like since? I want to hear what's going on. I'm listening. :) You had well over a year right before this happened?
I'm glad you survived welcome back. I don't think it matter if you're sorry or not. You're here today &amp; if you don't want to drink that's the most important part. 
This is a puzzling statement. Why did you post?
