To be honest I will probably tell her! I was over 3 years sober but went a bit crazy since last month. Have had a couple of hiccups since but feel I'm probably heading in the right direction. It's a bit scary but I truly feel I can get this. I know sober me is so much clearer and generally better than not-sober me. I just have to remind myself from time to time. It's a little lonelier in terms of family and friends than last time but that's understandable - I take full responsibility for it being my problem. But my dad has dementia and I would rather tell her in my own time (she has so much else to deal with). I don't have a great relationship with my husband &amp; feel he is passing the buck but it's my buck and there's no-one else I need to pass it too right now. I just thought I'd share to stop myself going mad with the stress of it all. Would welcome hearing of dealing with similar situations! This space does help so much even when only lurking! Thank you!

I don't know your situation but it's usually better to be open and honest with your family.  If you are hiding something from them you might want to examine why you are doing that.  And of your husband has stuck with you through your relapse he likely only has your best interest at heart.
I think he's out of line. I don't tell my family anything before I'm ready and sometimes I never share. They aren't qualified to understand or support complex recovery work just because I'm related to them. I don't owe them because they own no part of my recovery. I speak to a trusted couple friends my family on SD professionals. A few carefully-chosen souls. This is a sacred process and it is mine. IWNDWYT.
