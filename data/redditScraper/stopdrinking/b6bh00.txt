I never post but I wanted to today to say thank you to the people who maintain this sub. For the first few months after my last drink I would visit here to read about other people's difficulties struggles victories and milestones. It really was the thing that got me through and I couldn't be more grateful. Whether today is your 1000000000 or first day sober cheers I won't drink with you today!
