Hi everyone!..Working on day three. It already feels like a long day for me. I had difficulty sleeping last night which is par for the course I guess. I did get a couple of hours of sleep for which I am grateful. I'm keeping a close eye on my HALT right now - Hungry Angry Lonely Tired. It has been a long road for me to learn self-care that didn't revolve around smothering my feelings with substances. Right now I'm working on making major changes in myself and in my life. I need to have my strength and resources. And I'm learning to support &amp; care for my body as an integrated part of myself instead of ignoring it or running it into the ground. Things that can wait will have to wait until I can get to them. I've made the mistake before of trying to do too much before I'm in a place where I really have the ability to do so and in the past that has not ended well for me. So lesson learned. Easy does it but do it...Yesterday I went to an earlier meeting than I'd planned as I'd completely forgotten a previous commitment to have dinner with my sister and her family. I am not close with my family - they haven't known about my addiction issues. This sister is the person in my family I'm closest to and I'd decided to tell her. Very fortuitously we had an opportunity to be alone for about 20 minutes before dinner and I told her that I'm an alcoholic and that the medical marijuana that I've been using for my rheumatoid arthritis very quickly spiraled out of hand and I'm back to square one after a lengthy relapse. She was stunned she really had no idea. (And my family can be incredibly gossipy - I've no doubt that if anyone suspected the rumor mill would've already circulated to her.) But she was compassionate and appropriately supportive. We had a good talk. I'm glad that I told her it gives me more support and another ally. ..She told me that I could share this with her husband and two teenage kids if/when/how I so choose which I also deeply appreciated. I know that I can trust her to keep my confidences. I will share it with the rest of her family. I'm close with my niece and nephew and I want to share my experience with them so that they have the information about what my addiction looked like how it started how it progressed and what has and hasn't worked for me in dealing with it. I know that when I first started thinking about my drinking as a problem it was helpful for me to think back on the people who I've known who shared their own stories with me. Even though it very well might not be something that they end up dealing with themselves they might end up knowing someone who struggles with addiction and it may be helpful for them to know that they can talk to me as a resource. Also I will need to explain to my niece why I won't be taking her to Riot Fest this year...One of my projects to work on this weekend is extricating myself from Burning Man and selling the tickets that I already have for various upcoming concerts. I went to Burning Man last year and had a really phenomenal experience and people do go to Burning Man and stay sober. It is not a place for the newly sober. It's not worth the risk. I'm sticking to sober people and sober places for the foreseeable future. ..I do enjoy going out to see bands play and I've done so since I was a teenager years before I started drinking or taking drugs. I don't associate it directly with being intoxicated and in fact hanging out by the bar meant not going into the back room to see music. However sober people and sober places are my priority. Also I want to get my priorities generally in order. I want to decide what my goals are what is important to me and arrange my time and schedule accordingly. It is something that I want to keep in its proper place I don't want it to be something that dominates my life or my time. And I need to work on building a better real-life support network of sober friends. So I've decided to take a year off from seeing bands. It won't kill me - I'm 38 there have already been lengthy of periods in my adult life when life made going to concerts a very rare thing for me and I've already seen a ton of bands. Missing a few won't kill me (though I am sorry about a few that I will be missing.) And anyone in the Chicagoland area who's interested in making new friends in sobriety head over to /r/SDChicago I'm planning a meet up for the end of this month...I enjoyed the meeting that I went to yesterday and was so humbled by the kindness and support that I received. And as always I heard a few things that I needed to hear. I wouldn't wish this on anybody but I'm grateful that I'm not on my own in struggling with sobriety. Tonight I'm going to an Emotional Sobriety meeting. I've never been to one before but it sounds like something that I probably need. ..Otherwise I've been making myself some new sobriety playlists with lots of new music and I look forward to really getting into those over the coming months. I've gotten into a rut with a lot of things it's nice to get a change. And I'm quitting smoking! I'm a wuss I'm gonna go out &amp; pick up some NIcorette gum so I'm not so freaking cranky. Which do you think should I go for the cinnamon or orange flavored ones?..Wishing you all the best &amp; a wonderful weekend..Ginger\_Sprout out

You're never gonna keep me down!
Long meeting. Quote of the day:  I used to drink over people. Now I just get sober at their ass.
