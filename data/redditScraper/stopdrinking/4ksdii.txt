I have been trying to get sober for almost a year now after going 8 months clean. I think to myself about the moments I had when I was 8 months sober and how everything seemed great I was saving money I was skinny I wasn't having my family worried. But after my relapse I didn't go into a full on binge per say. I was drinking every other weekend and so and so fourth. So I drank for 2 months but like they say misery loves company and I have a uncle who is the same age as me we basically grew up together. His drinking is out of control but he somehow always has the money to drink and he drives and goes out almost every night. He is my contact for drinking I literally don't go out drinking with no one but with my uncle he knows everyone my friends are basically his friends. Well one night we went out drinking this was during my 2 month laspe anyways I'm paying for the drinks I remember the bill being pretty pricey but I was going to pay for it. My uncle starts arguing with the bartender because he thought the tax on the bill was too high mind you I'm paying but since he was drunk he feels he needs to argue. Long story shortpolice and bouncers were in the location and me instead of continuing to argue I paid the bill but my uncle still felt the need to argue.. we were leaving and for some reason the police grabbed me out of nowhere and arrested me claiming i assaulted one of them when I didn't even touch the police. They accused me of spitting in his face which I didn't do at all. They threw me on the ground face first and I even had a small cut on my face. I read the report they sent me to the hospital and in the report it said that the injury wasn't done by police. Anyways I got booked and released. So I had to lawyer up that's 4000 dollars down the drain. Fast forward to the day of court and my lawyer told me that these officer were notorious for complaints and false accusations and how in my city just getting close to a police officer and speaking to them loud you can get a AOP. Anyways my lawyer told me that my only options were to either take a deferred guilty plea where I admit I did it because there wasn't clear evidence or fight the case in court and it would cost me a extra 2000 money I didn't have and possibly going to jail if I lose the case. I took the deferred sentence which was 48 hours community service and anger management classes and in 6 months the charges would be dropped. I literally just feel stuck I was working a secuirty Job where you need to renew licenses every 2 years and you have to let them know if you got arrested during those 2 years. Even tho it is a deferred sentence all that is still on my record. I ended up leaving my job because I didn't want to let them know about what happened. I'm working a small time job but I want to go back to doing what I was doing but I feel like it's  going to be harder because of my past. I have gotten duis too. I told them about that this was in 2011. Anyways my whole point is that now I'm in a position where I don't want to solely blame anyone for the things that have happened to me in the past. But my uncle he continues drinking and living this fast lifestyle and I just can't be apart of it no more. It's like when I see him and he has drank than it automatically makes me want to drink too. It's like a trigger because I drink with no one else but my uncle. He lives extremely close to me. Some days he has his good days were he doesn't drink and I don't get the triggers but when he comes to my house and I knew he has drank it makes me want to do it. I know that I am a human and a adult and I make my own decisions and no one is putting a gun to my head to drink. But just having him so close to Me it makes it real difficult for me to stop. Because I can go 8 months sober but one day I can be bored and he's at my house or we can be at a place and I get the urge to drink. It's like he's my family my brother but I somehow feel the need that I need to stay away completely but I don't want to do that because he is family. I'm just feeling shitty because I was at 1 month and I drank yesterday and it was with my uncle. Sorry for the long paragraph and run-on sentences and grammer. But I just need to vent and I need to somehow cure this disease of my mine that is doing me and uncle no Good. I'm tired of this disease taking control of my life I want to change but I'm not doing it I don't know what's wrong I need to stop blaming others.

that's a lot...I can tell you I wont drink with you today and I hope that is supportive 
It sounds like an awful situation. I cannot even imagine what I'd do or how it would affect me - family job lawyer - sheesh! ..One thing I see here a lot is 'dry people dry places'. Others have made escape plans if they are going to be around alcohol e.g. "If I feel X I'll leave" "I'll leave at X:XX because the evening will only get worse from there". Have you talked to your uncle about the desire for sobriety?..You have lived 8 months without alcohol I'll join you in making today another +1 sober day.
