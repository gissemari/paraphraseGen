Sometimes it's hard to be grateful to remember that I'm an alcoholic to try to consciously avoid the 'old' way of thinking. The constant vigilance can be tiring particularly if I'm tired or emotional. I've found my Itty Bitty Shitty Committee stamping their collective feet like petulant children resulting in thoughts like *I don't wanna be an alcoholic anymore!*. At these times I try and write a gratitude list forcing *the committee* to acknowledge the immense amount of good in my life:..*1. This sub. Life saving and filled with immense wisdom. I take something away from it every time I read it..2. My Hubz. He's a hairy hunk of loveliness and I'm fortunate he's stuck with me these 14 years..3. My job. Sure it annoys me at times and I often struggle with my boss's need to be a dick but I enjoy it and it provides me and my family with money..4. My house. It's rented but it's a roof over our heads! .5. The weekend. Deep sleep snuggles and ticking things off the to do list.*..I'm a lucky lady to be given this chance at sobriety. I know the 'yets' that are waiting patiently out there should I decide to drink again but I'm lucky to be able to say **not today motherfuckers not today**..Enjoy your sober weekends xx
