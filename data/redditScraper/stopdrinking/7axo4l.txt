Lots of things going my way now.  Financially I'm still struggling because of a cut in my income and I basically dug myself into a financial hole. ..I know I'm not seeing immediate results like a plus balance in my bank but I'm getting there.  This new year brings hope and promise and I'm looking forward to it so very much...I also stopped losing weight.  So far I have 30 pounds lost but a few weeks ago I kinda slipped back into old eating habits.  It's been a struggle to get back on track...Work is work.  The boss is about to have some surgery that will take him out of the picture for three full months starting January.  I won't have any time off and I will be on call 24/7.  Looking forward to after all that so I can take some time off and enjoy myself a little...Meanwhile I'll just keep doing what I've been doing......Taking it day by day.

Awesome! Glad to hear you are experiencing wonderful sobriety! 
Congrats 172 - looking forward to seeing you 6 month shiny star!!! I will not drink with you today.
Sounds like a plan! Congrats on 172 days and 30 lbs! Thats a lot to accomplish! The rest will fall in place if you keep treading on the same path....IWNDWYT!
24/7 on call is the worst.  Good luck
Hey 16bit! Not long to go now! I'll be celebrating with gelato... again :).What can I say - I'm a creature of habit (obviously!) What do you have planned for your big day?  
I'm excited for mine too! Half a year is such an accomplishment I will not drink with you today!
