But it is true its been 400 days since I had a drink.  It feels like it was yesterday that I was struggling with cravings.  Pacing and cursing for days on end.  Now there are still the occasional desirers but they never last long and I laugh at them.  For those of you at the early stages ... don't lose hope.  If I can stop after nearly 50 years of drinking (last ten hard) so can you.

I'm still right behind you Hoppy!..Woot woot!
This right here. It's what I needed right this second. I'm only at 2 weeks (as of tomorrow at 8:30 p.m. PT) but have been struggling with feeling dragged out and as if I'm "missing something." I will try to keep my eye on the end of the journey. 
Yay!  Happy 400!
