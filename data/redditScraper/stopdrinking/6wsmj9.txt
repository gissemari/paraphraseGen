I cannot tell you guys how many times I have failed to quit drinking. This is maybe my 10th time relapsing in a short space of time. I've been so so low depressed drinking alone in my room. Sometimes I sit in my room alone just because I find it better being alone than downstairs with my family or outside meeting people. I need to chance drink is destroying my life my sanity and my wallet...I want to tell my dad but I won't because I told my mum and she reacted very badly and I get the feeling my dad will too. So I have done something potentially very good for myself. I was born and raised as a catholic but turned away from the faith as I thought it was all rubbish. But now I feel that God may be the answer or at leat help so I have turned back to him. ..I have bought myself a bible and crucifix necklace in the hope and belief that God may protect me and show me the way to right all my wrongs and rid me of this demon that is alcohol addiction. I'm ready to make a change and set my life back on track guys I'm happy to be here and will not drink with you today.

People are scared of what they don't understand. Don't take her reaction as a sign that you're not doing the right thing by admitting to family that you have a problem because you are. &lt;3..Glad you're here!
Welcome! Once I allowed myself to be vulnerable my healing was finally able to begin. ..Stick around! This place is a life saver. Stay strong! I won't drink with you.
