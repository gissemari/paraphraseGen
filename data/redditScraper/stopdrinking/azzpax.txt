Later this month will mark 3 months totally sober. (The longest stretch in many years). Just out of curiosity last week I decided to find out how much money I saved not buying up the liquor store every couple days. I ended up totaling about 800 bucks which puts it at 3200 annually. I also recently re-enrolled in school and am putting that money towards my tuition. ..When I was drinking school was the last thing on my mind. I continued to work my job that I hated (still am but now I can see the finish line at least) and just dealt with all the hardships by drowning them away instead of trying to find a viable solution. Not only has putting down the bottle cleared my head to allow me to concentrate on my life goals but now it is literally helping fund my future...The benefits of not drinking are infinite if you just look in the right places. If you are having trouble just know that the struggle will all be worth it. The misery in the first few days/weeks is terrible but you come out a stronger and better person on the other side. "If you are going through hell keep going." (Ironic that I'm listing an inspirational quote from an alcoholic.)..I wish you all the best and thank you again for the support. You are all an inspiration whether you have been clean for 1 hour or 1 decade. IWNDWYT
