I have been sober since February 22. I started to feel really confident after about day 105 or so but recently I have been having intense urges and realistic feelings of wanting to completely relapse...I was very curious to hear any and every experience people have had with Alcoholics Anonymous...Thanks.

Worth checking out! 
I've never been but I've heard good things about it!..There's a couple of articles from the sidebar of r/alcoholism that might be helpful:..[Your First AA meeting: A Guide for the Perplexed](http://www.bma-wellness.com/papers/First_AA_Meeting.html)..and [What to expect at an AA meeting](https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/2v573a/the_where_why_and_what_should_i_expect_at_my/).....and [What happens at a Recovery Group Meeting](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/34vu9m/faq_what_happens_at_a_recovery_group_meeting/) from the FAQ here.....There are also lots of AA speaker recordings on YouTube you could listen to in the meantime.....The ones from Anthony Hopkins and Craig Ferguson are hilarious!..Hope that helps - best of luck and let us know how you get on!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;

AA saved my ass. Going to meetings picking a sponsor and working the steps removed my obsession with alcohol by the end of my first year. Good luck. And check out the oinks that woody provided for you. ..Keep us posted. IWNDWYT 
Saved my life!
It's got the biggest membership in the country when it comes to in-person meetings. There are meetings all over the world all the time...The "program" as written is a bit "meh" and filled with stealth-religious bullshit but the meetings certainly saved my life when I was at rock bottom. If you ever need to talk to alcoholics in person AA is there for you. ..If you're curious then give it a shot. The exposure will help you grow in your sobriety whether you end up loving it or hating it. 
I am 17 meetings into a 90 meetings in 90 days commitment. Actually look forward to them. If you told me 3 weeks ago that I'd be looking forward to getting up at 5:00  AM to meet my sponsor for coffee before a 7:00 AM meeting I would have told you that you were crazy and that I'd be at the bar. But I am! Really helps me to just talk to other guys with similar problems/stories/solutions.

I have made some of the best relationships of my life in AA. People who work their programs are some of the most solid people out there. The big book and my sponsor have helped me learn steps to manage my alcoholism and emotions but my fellowship circle props me up when I am down. Give it a try. One of the most popular sayings I've heard in the rooms is  take what you need . Not everything in the big book will be relevant to you. Not everything people say will feel relevant. But you will always find at least one tidbit that you can identify with and take comfort from.
