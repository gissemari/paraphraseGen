This subreddit is truly amazing. What a great group of people. Me? I've been sober a day-and-a-half after relapsing. Have a great weekend everyone. Stay strong. .

Congrats on coming back after the relapse. What are you doing differently this time?.
Did I share the [Baby Steps with you in the past?](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2gg9tp/where_to_start_stopping_the_baby_steps/)  Good luck.
Good job dude! You can get through this week!
I just relapsed as well. This is a great resource I agree with you wholeheartedly. 
We are pretty amazing aren't we? You must be too!
