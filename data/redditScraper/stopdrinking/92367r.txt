I'm pretty close to that.  I had my first physical in several years the other day.  Dr. said my turnaround was shocking.  Weight dropped High Blood Pressure gone all of my tests perfect.  I still remember being in my early 30's and having him tell me I had scarring on my liver.  Now I'm 49 and in perfect health.  Couldn't be better!  Oh and congratulations!
