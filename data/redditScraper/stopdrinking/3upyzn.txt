How I Made It To One Year.....1. I make a Daily Promise (or three). I learned this ritual - the very foundation of my method - from /u/CoolCrosby's [Baby Steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/). Every morning before my feet hit the ground I promise myself I'm not going to drink today. I speak the words. I repeat that promise to myself a few minutes later in the bathroom mirror. I speak the words again. Then while I'm having my morning coffee I browse /r/stopdrinking and I make the pledge again this time with about 150 or 200 other folks in the Daily 24 Hour Pledge. Each time I make my promise I visualize my success just like the elite athletes do. I picture myself going to work going to meetings and lunch coming home after work (that's a big one) doing chores and running errands having dinner etc. all without drinking. I check back to /r/stopdrinking about eight or ten times a day. I read other people's stories I offer them encouragement and support and I often write about my own journey to see what they might have to say about it. ..2. I read Allen Carr's "Easy Way to Control Alcohol" and I started to think a little differently about alcohol what it is and the place it occupied in my life. The book and its approach have their flaws - to be sure - but I took from it what I wanted. For me alcohol is silly and a poor choice. There are *so* many reasons to not drink it...3. I filled my time with productive things. I changed my routines. Yes I lay on the couch and watched Netflix and sports with the best of them. But when I was done with that I gave my son's bedroom a makeover I enlarged my vegetable garden I took over the task of the family bills and accounts (something my wife had long ago realized she couldn't count on me to do). I busied myself immediately upon leaving work for home as this had been my witching hour; my inevitable dropping in at the liquor store. I filled the countless hours I'd have frittered away drinking with things that improved my and my family's lives...4. Dry People and Dry Places. To this day if I'm going to be somewhere or with someone that might make it difficult or uncomfortable for me to not drink I'll have a coping plan going in or I just won't go. None of it matters more than my sobriety...5. I worked on being the kind of person I admire and respect. I like kind and forgiving people; thoughtful and caring people; generous and loving people. I want to be more like them and so I govern myself accordingly. Governing is something you can't do when you're not in control. I actively practice these attributes and I actively try to be mindful (I fail a lot). I couldn't do this in a year of course - or a lifetime - it's a journey like so many others but I have embarked upon it...6. Lots of San Pellegrino and lime...7. In moments of real weakness I play the tape forward. What would happen if I just had a drink? It would be OK right? No. For me there is no *one* drink. There would be eight more. And then ten the next day and the hangover. Every time I've ever gone back to drinking in a relapse or in an attempt to moderate my drinking's been a snowball rolling down a mountainside picking up speed and getting bigger and bigger. ...until it plows through the village at the bottom. And then darkness and despair. If I play that tape forward I'm able to skip a few scenes beyond that one drink see the real result and know that only sobriety lets the sun and light come streaming into my life...I was alone in my struggles until I found this sub. I am profoundly grateful to have it in my life.

Absolutely wonderful! That San Pellegrino looks very good. I think I am going to give it a try soon. 
Thanks for your post. It's my first day here and I thought this was awesome! 
I love your comment "only sobriety lets the sun and light come streaming into my life."  So true and words I'll remember in times of weakness.  Thank You!

Wonderful post! Thanks now I don't have to make one cause you said my things.
Love this. 
Excellent helpful post  ..Congratulations!  ..
Very helpful thank you! I really like #7 I think I will add that to my arsenal. 
Thank you for the post.  I will spend extra reflection on point #5. Now that if decided to live sober I have to figure out the other priorities that I have time for and care.about again.  
Yeah that's a really solid plan.
I love it. Thank you for sharing. I'm craving hard right now and your post reminded me to play the tape forward. Thank you 
Excellent post. Excellent. 
Awesome post. Thank you. Keep up the great living!
Fabulous Flow! I love your points 1: I do this everyday(do miss a couple of check-ins) 2: I read Jason Vale's book 3: definitely more productive these days! 4:Not been out much lately but I have work Christmas parties/leaving do's to attend(must get exit strategy in place) 5: I have so much personal work to achieve. I really like the expression you used "govern myself". Yep that one's definitely a work in progress! 6: Having a fav soft drink is imperative!! 7: 'Playin' that tape forward' this tip has been a life saver for me too!..Excellent post thanks for sharing :).
This is an awesome post my friend.  You acted your way into better thinking!
Great post.  Thanks for being a part of SD FMF.  [\m/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB_QmSWVY7o)
Congratulations man! 
Play the tape forward that really hit home for me. Thank you for this post. 
Awesome--this is so practical! I could see this being a major part of a SD crowd-sourced and refined and ever-improving checklist that helps answer that question "I'm trying to stay sober--what do I do next?" Or "I've got a few days sober--how do I hang on to my sobriety?"
Thanks for posting this excellent ideas! One of the greatest things that I've gotten from SD and the fine folk who post here is a whole host of tools to use to avoid relapse. Your list is brilliant. Number 7 in particular has gotten me through so many cravings that I can't even count them. :) 
THIS IS GOLD. You are an amazing human!! There is something to be said on how you start your day! And i'm glad to know that this sub has played a huge role in your sobriety! I'm finding myself on here A LOT in these first few days and it's been my guiding light as I transition from WHISKEY and GINGER Jenn to just regular ole' turbo Jenn. Thanks for the post!
Thanks. I might get downvoted for this but this sounds more like avoding to drink and not really tackle the reasons.  ..I have managed to stay sober for nearly two years but those two years were especially on the weekends miserable! I want to understand **why** I'm having the urges why I want to shut down my brain! Is it because I'm bored? Is it because I'm anxious? Why??? There must be a reason!
&gt;5. I worked on being the kind of person I admire and respect. I like kind and forgiving people; thoughtful and caring people; generous and loving people. I want to be more like them and so I govern myself accordingly. Governing is something you can't do when you're not in control. I **actively practice** these attributes and I **actively try to be mindful** (I fail a lot). I couldn't do this in a year of course - or a lifetime - it's a journey like so many others but I have embarked upon it...(Emphasis mine)..This is the part about changing one's life. Change doesn't just *happen* for the most part. There is epiphany and determination but change comes from action. And *the best thing* about changing my own life to a sober life has been the amazing side effect of everything else benefitting from it. My attitude. My perspective. My interactions. Awareness of my actions. When I'm hyper focused on sober actions it stands to reason I will become focused on my actions in general and that gives me to opportunity to act in a manner I often wish came naturally to me. ..Thanks for this share Flow. Great ideas in here. 
i love the last one about playing the tape foreword that has saved me multiple times in moments of weakness. just imagining the disappointment i would feel the next morning..not to mention the other undesirable sensations..stops me cold in my tracks and bring me back to earth real quick..staying sober is something you can never take for granted being over confident about it can lead you to trouble. .thank you for the great advice!
