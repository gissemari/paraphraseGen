Trying to stay sober tonight. Trying to find comfort in anything other than drinking... but I am struggling. .Recent OCD spike. From what I understand  alcohol depletes serotonin which  is already lacking in OCD..Drinking will just prolong this... but the intrusive thoughts are overwhelming and I wish I could turn my head off.. I spend so much time solving problems that only exist between my ears. .Sponsor is away for a few days. .I will not drink with you tonight.
