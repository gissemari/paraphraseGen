***The Vent-o-Matic 3000 is back by popular demand!*** It slices and dices all your worries away. But wait--there's more! It's been scientifically proven to help you stay sober and has been named the #1 solution from the National Complaining Society. Act now and get in on the action before it's too late! ..___...Have you ever been so annoyed at someone or something in your life related to your sobriety that you just want to explode yelling to get it out of your system?!? Sure ya have. That's life. ..So here's the fun part. If anyone is having a tough time right now or even this weekend post here and get it off your chest!  *If you're unsure what to vent about [click here to check out the original post for some ideas!](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/4lm6uk/stratyturds_ventomatic_3000/#header).._____..Yesterday was sort of a neat milestone for me. It marked two years as a mod here on r/stopdrinking. I'm very fortunate to have spent the last two years helping make the place that saved my life the home for so many of us to get support...For me SD was a way in a first step in my journey of sobriety. People here *knew* each other. Their struggles. Their triumphs. They shared inside jokes laughs and it felt like home to me. So I stuck around. I commented posted READ man I spent hours every day just reading and I found out what worked for me. ..I owed a lot of my success to the [mods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UXircX3VdM) who took care of this place and when the the chance came to join the ranks and give back I couldn't say no. It's been an absolute honour to see so so so so many people grow as sober individuals here together. ..I've made lifelong friends on SD people I consider family. Thank you to every single one of you SD sobernauts for being there for each other. It's amazing to witness :) ..So...*where's the vent straty?* Ya I know. I have been thinking about it tonight but I can't think of anything. I've got crap to do life stuff to sort out laundry to finish bills a severe lack of ice cream in the apartment but I am just so happy to be able to have those things to deal with. Because that means that I'm actually living again.  [\o/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NMph943tsw)....
----------immediate responses--------

Very tired of the loneliness found in sobriety. The more i stay sober the more i learn about myself and the more of myself i want to share with a special someone. 
I gots some hot air to vent. I suppose...I was in a funk the past few days just a weird mood kind of tired neurotransmitters being funny. Short fuse last night easily exasperated. I just put on the dodgers game (which lasted 4 1/2 hours) and didn't respond to texts (one of which was from my  sponsor  who I've been ducking. Haven't been going to AA for 2 weeks. I made like 90 meetings in 75 Days didn't hit the 90 in 90. But I got an apartment and a job so my circumstances changed)...Anyway weird mood stuff lasted through the morning. I had to work at 9 but ran home to feed my cat first (been housesitting). Headed to work and I got in a car accident...I've had a perfect driving record for 18 years no accidents ever and now that I'm sober I get in an accident and it's my fault...Tried going left around a line of cars to get in the turn lane and a lady comes screaming past out of nowhere so I reflexively turned right into the car I was going around. And the lady who forced the accident (she didn't even have a lane to be in back there as the turn lane hadn't started yet) FLIPS ME OFF and runs a red light and is gone...So yeah I'm liable...But nobody was hurt my car and the other are just scraped up and dented and my insurance is good.  Could be worse!!..And I was only 13 minutes late to work...So tomorrow I get the car into the collision place for an appraisal and learn how to take the bus to and from work...The $1000 deductible has me stressed out but I'll work it out...No what I don't feel like doing? Drinking. I did eat a pint of McConnell's ice cream though. 
It finally happened: I (freelance illustrator) took on more work than I can actually do. I've been working nutcase hours for days without rest and just snapped yesterday and had a "3/4 of a panic attack" my commissioners are understanding as are the fans of my webcomics (whose updates i'll have to skip to sort this out) but i've been so stressed and overworked i've been finding myself fantasizing about a way to run from myself for some time. What a mess!
Worst day of my sobriety thus far. Today just flat out f ing sucked and I was pissed off all day with a few things happening at the moment but at no point was I thinking I should hit the liquor store like I had before in the past. Hit the gym after work instead and took my frustration out there. Proud of myself 
Does anybody else have that one person in their workplace that takes the absolute bloody piss with sick leave? Urgh she's off ill at least once a month usually sandwiched around when she already had time booked off or on a Monday and Friday to give herself a nice long weekend. She's been off all week this week and came in for two hours yesterday just so she could clock in some time in the office without having to produce a doctors note. I really wish HR would pick up on this because I'm usually the one who had to pick up her slack. ..Most notable offences were the days directly after her team nights out or the time I was out with her and watched myself as she drank a bottle and a half of wine then called in sick the next day. .And here I am toilling away not feeling well myself but having to get through because we're moving office and this week is the busiest week for packing everything up...Urgh! At least it's the weekend tomorrow. I have no plans except a Stranger Things marathon and Thor Ragnarok in the cinema. 
Insomnia arghhh!!
"Best friend" is done with me. Turns out I was just her weed connection. When I quit intoxicants she quit our friendship. It hurts but I'm glad it only took her 38 days to ditch me. Time to make sober friends! IWNDWYT!
VENT: A few days ago my anger was through the roof yesterday I was depressed as hell my sleep pattern is all over the place...it's a bit of a rollercoaster this ol' sobriety stuff. My vent today is my total lack of weight loss. I'm eating three healthy meals a day. I don't eat bread pasta rice chocolate potatoes pizza soft drinks...any of the high GI stuff whch is suppose to mess with your blood sugar. I eat mostly fresh fish eggs green veggies wholegrains fruit some dairy. I'm running and skipping and walking every day and of course I don't drink alcohol. Yet my weight hasn't budged in 40 days. Am tempted just to go back to pizzas ice cream and cheese melts if healthy eating makes no difference to my fat ass. Maybe I just have to live on water and air to move the dial! Hey ho...

Straty thanks for sharing that and thanks for being part of the team. This place is the best. 
So it's Friday night in Quirkys neighbourhood &amp; so far it had been pretty quiet *sigh* Until..... they have decided to start doing burn outs &amp; revving their V8's as loud as possible.... It's almost 9.30pm &amp; there are little kids around &amp; old people on their own.... And this fucking group of inconsiderate fuckers are up to their usual fucking bullshit..... I thought they had got it all out of their systems last night when they where still up partying at 3am - with that one arsehole stirring the fuck out of my dog again..... needless to say I woke up freaking out - big loud dog barks will scare the shite out of you when you have been sound asleep especially when it's almost in your ear!!!! Oh listen...... it's quiet...... they've taken off &amp; hopefully won't return any time soon..... please universe keep them the fuck away tonight......Only good thing about having fucked up drunk neighbours - it reminds me of how much of an inconsiderate bitch I could be actually that's one of the reasons I started drinking in my own home alone - so that I wouldn't piss other people off &amp; I don't ever want to be like that again....
Hey thanks for the backstory stratyturd!  I love the *vent strategy* even though you said it wasn't one...I found some wisdom in there for sure! Glad you are one of our mods :) xo
So excited to go to a concert tonight and enjoy it SOBER! I'm in!
Therapy yesterday was a little rough. It felt like I was arguing with her a bit. I would explain something and when she offered insight or suggestions she was a bit short with me. Admittedly I was ten minutes late due to traffic issues and my boss chatting with me at the end of the day but her behavior still felt odd to me. I'm sure it'll be fine in the long run but in the immediacy it rubbed me the wrong way. 
Holy cow straty!  2 years!  As one of the many whose lives you've saved I can't possibly begin to say thank you enough.  It's like 'thank you' won't cover it honestly.  You're a great friend and I wouldn't be who I am today without your friendship ((#.  .....and on the mod front thanks for being a great teacher and for answering my 'hey what does this button do' questions!  
I HATE CUSTOMERS! Co-worker that does that job out sick. I had to cover. There are so many stupid people out there. I know this is only day 5 for me but I never noticed before cause (as I thought) I was mellow from drinking. No offense to anyone on the list but people yesterday were just stupid. It was very hard not to have a drink last night but I won! I did not drink with you yesterday!
I will not drink with you today.
My vent is my job one of my class sessions was to throw a party for 13 children my pay for that hour? $8. Super frustrated but didn't have any real thoughts of drinking today so it goes down as a success. (Also it wasn't as traumatic an experience as I was anticipating but the pay rate its just ugh) 
Only four days in but I'm feeling very lonely today. I was lonely when I was drinking but I didn't have to think about it then. But I'm not going to drink today. I'm going to go to work and then the gym for some distraction. 
Well first congrats on two years as a tireless SD mod and thanks for all that you do especially inventing the Vent-O-Matic!!..Today nothing in particular is building up like water behind the dam and a lot of that has to do with keeping the flow from the relief valve steady. I have tools for that: 4th 5th &amp; 10th steps (AA) screaming into a pillow and of course the Vent-o-Matic 3000!!..These tools give me alternatives to drinking in order to cope with the normal stresses of life. That's something! :)
So a big fear of mine happened the other day I was at a bar hanging out and picked up what I thought was the remnants of my water cup and took a big drink.  I had a mouthfull of the bottom end of someone's redbull and vodka.  It was the grossest thing I've done in a long time.  I swallowed on a sip of it before I realized what It was.  The wife saw my face and instantly knew what had happened and a few friends noticed too a hush fell over them.  I spit it all out back into the cup said whoops! and moved on with the night.  Everyone thttps://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/7910uu/the_ventomatic_3000_for_friday_october_27_2017/#hought I'd freak out or something hell I thought I'd freak out because I'd built it up so much in my head.  ...It tasted super grosser than I remember that's for sure. 
Last weekend I went to a wedding that had an open bar. My SO who has been really amazing about not drinking (has a glass of wine or a beer here and there) ended up getting completely shit-faced. I was embarrassed and annoyed but I kept my cool and frankly didn't feel at all jealous that I wasn't drinking. ..I remind myself now that a year ago that would have been me. I would have been the one drinking and acting stupid and worrying the next day about what I might have said or done. Instead the next morning I felt great and I got to tease my SO about the stupid and I was able to celebrate a NDV.
3 days sober &amp; my husband is still pissed off &amp; moping around when he's home. He did this for a full month last time I was drunk. It's frustrating he's not supporting me and chooses to handle it this way. I am my own support though. And again today I will not be drinking.
Waiting  for 45 minutes for a blood test only to be told there is no blood test.  Then been made to feel like a liar for suggesting a member of staff had made the mistake.  Normal goto beer crossed my mind on the walk home past the endless pubs and off licences but when I finally had that first taste it all just chilled out..... God I love tea...Not drinking with you all today 
I can't stop EATING! The first few weeks I didn't have much of an appetite but now that I have almost 5 weeks sober and have been going to the gym revving up my metabolism I'm hungry all. the. time.  I think I need to learn how much to eat now that I'm not drinking **thousands** of extra calories every week.  
I work a high stress job and am super super wound up right now. I have tickets to a masquerade ball and you get two drink tickets with admission. I want those drinks. I want those drinks more than anything on earth right now. 
I keep getting in my own way when I'm trying to forge solid friendships. I was supposed to go to a Halloween party with friends tonight but am feeling really tired and bailed out. I m mad at myself for pushing away people who like me  
Dealing with a few things:..Paying back my old roommates for bills owed. ..My new (only two months) roommate informing me that they have been severely behind on rent and we may be evicted. So also worrying about finding a new place to live...My work schedule not lining up with AA meetings in my town and not having my own vehicle to get to out-of-town meetings.. .Fighting the urge to buy a bottle or two of cheap wine and saying "fuck it" because said roommate is not home. (Let's face it: Not worth the trouble because I'd end up crying and hating myself.)..Wondering if today is the day the toilet will fall through the floor among other house-related worries that had not be brought to my attention before I agreed to move in...Attempting to not look into the past to see where I fucked it all up and to continue looking forward because that's the best thing I can do right now.
Came home from work and there is a small party going on. The smell of vodka is wafting into my room. I want it. I really really want it. Help me stay strong? 
So I'm at that interesting age where most people are either married with kids or are perpetuating their college years long past due.  Most of my "friends" fell off when I sobered up.  Drinking pals mostly but I had no idea at the time how much of my social life was sourced from the bar.  Add to that a move to a new town the addition of a child and a subsequent divorce... basically I have nearly no friends left.  The few friends I do have are amazing but they live in other parts of the world or the country.  Not exactly available for a Friday night hang.  The people I know in the area are either lazy unmotivated or are avoiding me for reasons I am not aware.  Whatever the reason being a sober middle aged single guy with a kid seems to put people on guard.  Women think I'm ether damaged (fair assumption) or looking for a replacement mommy (couldn't be further from the truth) and guys think I'm attached to drama or I'm weird or untrustworthy because I don't drink.  It makes weekends without my kid a challenge because I have no one else to interact with.  I usually find ways to occupy my time but there have been stints where if it weren't for the barista at the nearby coffee shop I wouldn't have a face to face conversation with another adult for a full two or three days. Having a chaotic schedule between parenting housework and professional work makes finding time to create a new social life tough and makes it hard to feel rooted.  ..But then there are the rare occasions (like tonight) like where I had a relatively peaceful week I'm not painfully exhausted and all I want to do is go out and have fun with people my own age.  Looking for things to do in town: "Party at Bar X" "Live band at Club Y" "Drink Specials at Z's Tavern".   In a town where I know next to no one the only options for fun and social activities are sourced out of drinking establishments. I've put myself in these situations before and very few want to talk to a sober guy at a bar which means either I drink or I stand around as the solo weird guy.  Neither sounds like a worthy goal so I end up sitting at home feeling lonely and miserable and forcibly reminding myself that being drunk won't make me feel better in the long run.  I'll wake up tomorrow happy I didn't drink tonight but have the same struggle tomorrow night.  These are my white knuckle weekends...&lt;/vent&gt;
Ugh it sucks. I haven't even had cravings until today. Of course I'd come home to a boozy house. Vodka isn't even my poison! 
Why is there so many clickbait titled threads in stopdrinking? I mean it doesn't make me want to drink but like homies it's bad. We can do better.
I've been sober for a little over 9 months. I'm still moody and sad all the time and I don't know what to do about it. I used to be crazy and drunk and now I'm just crazy. I am blessed with ppl who love and support me and many good things in my life and I have brief glimpses of happiness and relief that keep me going however most days it just feels like a constant struggle against my anxiety. Pushing through it and trying to any daily tasks on top of putting on a smile for the world is draining me to my core. I just want to feel better. If i didn't feel so shitty all the time i think life would be good again and i could handle it coming at me. I just feel so lost and unsure about everything. I guess i just thought I'd feel better by now...
Fantastic Straty! .You inspire me..Now that I've found my fam online.my aim is to not relapse so I can live too..Mark my word - I will mod one day..First post!!.WNDWY -JE.
