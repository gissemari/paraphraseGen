I HIT ONE YEAR!..I stayed up til midnight to watch my sobriety counter congratulate me. I have never been so excited for an anniversary or celebration in my entire life. I have never been so fucking proud of anything I've ever done. ..I truly never imagined I'd ever get this far. I thought I'd die before I quit drinking. I didn't want to do anything with my life but have enough comfort where I could drink when I wanted to (all the time). Here's a little comparison of me January 2018 and me now since I enjoy seeing those from others as motivation:..**Me in January 2018:**..Violently depressed suicidal. Always feeling like shit and using all of my energy to keep going to my dead-end life-sucking call center job. ..Behind on rent eviction threats on my front door bi-weekly. ..Paying for bottles of bottom shelf booze in quarters. Chugging gin in the car when I got to my boyfriend's house then mouthwash so he wouldn't know (he didn't like when I drank around him). Once he poured out my vodka stash in my backpack and I instead found an expensive bottle of gin of his and drank the rest of it. He never noticed until he moved out because he's the type of freak who has a bottle of alcohol in his house for months without touching it. ..Unable to cope with my PTSD from a sexual assault due to not FEELING anything I should have been. I drowned my feelings as most of us did. ..No degree. Weekly repo threats from my bank because I was behind on my car loan. ...**ME NOW JANUARY 2019:**..- Caught up on bills. I can afford to have them automatically pulled monthly now. I can afford little splurges like earrings that don't make my ears bleed a donut and a coffee when my sugar cravings wake up gifts for my boyfriend and enough gas to visit him two hours away every weekend. ..- Living with my parents who've never touched alcohol in their entire life. Changing my living situation was such a huge game changer for me. Being around people who don't think about alcohol ever was so appreciated. It made a massive difference for me. And the free food and rent have obviously been key in me catching up financially this year. ..- Working as a dental assistant. Who knew a year ago that I would FALL IN LOVE with the dental field?! I am obsessed. I love it. ..- Speaking of I'm working on my degree for dental hygiene since they make astronomically more than dental assistants do. I'll be pulling $80K/year before I turn 30 and that sounds pretty damn good to me. I'll be able to support myself and live and work wherever I want instead of relying on having a roommate or partner or parents to share the cost of living. Not to mention the fact that I LOVE WHAT I DO. I have never felt that in my entire life. ..- My sleep quality is insane. I actually get...tired now? Who the fuck woulda thought? I forgot that was even a thing. It's so great to wake up and just be TIRED instead of waking up and feeling like SHIT in ten different ways. The cure for tired is a cup of coffee or exercise instead of having to down tons of greasy food and more alcohol at 6AM. ..- I've lost 15 pounds despite eating probably double the amount I used to since it still amounts to less calories than the alcohol I was taking in each day. I ran a half marathon and it was fucking EASY. Last time I ran one I was hungover and buzzed and goddamn it was the longest 13 miles ever. This one felt like a breeze despite it raining and being windy!..Ok I'll stop now. Wait one last thing. My depression and anxiety and PTSD are all so managed now. That's the best thing. I'm just...happier. SO MUCH HAPPIER. ..Every time I had to quit drinking because I'd relapsed it sucked and I wished I could fast forward to where I am today. So if you're thinking of relapsing please don't. Get one more day under your belt. The key really is one day at a time and sober people/sober places. I promise life has so much more to offer you than just satisfying your cravings.

Amazing! I aspire to have your results.
This is so beautiful. I am so happy for you. You honestly get back what you put in to life. Your discipline will continue to pay off!..Can I ask what your turning point or epiphany was?

Couldn't be more proud of you. Thank you for sharing your story    
Well done :) 
Amazing well written post and super inspiring! Congratulations on your year!   
I'm 7 days in. I needed to hear this.  Congrats OP.
Thank you so much for sharing. Yesterday was a tough day for me and I started thinking of how much I just would love to escape from life for a few hours with a glass or two of wine.  I am living with my sister and drinking isnt an option here (which is why I chose to live here)   so I knew I wouldn't but just thinking about drinking isn't good.  When I read your post it reminded me of how bad it is when I drink.  I know there will be tough days in life.  I'm still learning how to get through them sober.  It's not easy but I'm doing it.  IWNDWYT :)
Effing eck! That's awesome! Well done!
Congratulations!
Classic post. Great read 
&gt; So if you're thinking of relapsing please don't. ..Thank you for phrasing it like this. My relapse was 100% intentional and something I kind of had baked into the equation. Relapse has this air of randomness to it...like it's this act of god that appears out  of the blue. I know for me personally this line of thinking made it easier to drink this past holiday season after 3+ months of sobriety. ..Oh and great job OP! 
Great post. Congratulations on your super-fantastic year! IWNDWYT
Congratulations! What an amazing story.

Congratulations on 1 year! I love reading these posts and seeing how much other's lives have improved through sobriety. ..I've been a little over a year sober but I had to fall really far (countless times) to get here. I'm sure I'm not the only one in that respect. The obsession is still there and I've forgotten how to cope with life in a positive healthy way. (Or perhaps I never knew how to at all.)..Seeing your positivity and hope for the present and future helps reignite my positivity...Keep up the amazing work. This post is so motivating. Thanks for sharing!
Congrats on 1 year...You certainly seem happier and healthier.
Congrats. Proud of you!
Proud of you :') I too am diagnosed PTSD MDD (major depression disorder) with Panic Disorder GAD. I used to be a fucken wreck! I used to say I would never stop drinking and I wished 2 beers were always in me because it helps. But I see now how far off reality that was - All of my issues are like nonexistent now. I'm completely off medication no drugs no alcohol no smoking as straight as straight can get! I get sorta high off sobriety eating right and exercise. I feel peak again like I'm 18 and ready to climb mountains...Congrats to you can't wait for my 365!
Congratulations! ..I will not drink with you today
I love you for posting this! I'm a bit over a month and a half in here I dreamt about drinking last night and I had a crowd of people cheering me on in this dream. I woke up thinking " Am I easier to be around drunk?" The honest answer is likely "no" but I really dont want to ask anyone.   iwndwyt!
How did you accomplish this? Please don't say AA!  I want to find a way with out AA
Thanks for your post. I'm hitting the end of Dry Jan at the moment and getting all the frustrating idle thoughts about continuing. Really good to read your story. Congratulations! 
Love this story thanks for sharing! IWNDWYT

Thank you so much for sharing! Good work and great story!
Awesome congratulations!! .You forgot some other benefits ;).https://theverybestforme.com/the-countless-benefits-of-being-sober/.
Well done !
I've been sober 290-something days and a lot of things have gotten better--I'm in better shape I switched to a more lucrative career etc.  But right now that new career is making me want to relapse bad.  I get home and just want to erase my brain.  I'm already angry and tired all the time from my job so alcohol can't make that any worse right?  I mean I'm sure it would but I just feel like throwing a fucking tantrum. I want to scream and cry and take a shit on my desk because fuck all you people right? I mean it makes me feel like an asshole to feel this way but I do.  Still IWNDWYT
Awesome post. Thank you so much for sharing. It brings hope to so many me included. One day at a time! IWNDWYT!..Congratulations!!
Congratulations on all of it! Look at all you've accomplished! And good on you for owning your success. :) Such a great story. Your happiness is shining through.

Happy sober circle around the sun!
That's really impressive! I've been thinking about drinking a lot this week and just checked in here to get my mind right. Your post really helps thank you.
Thank you!
So very on point with what you say about getting one more day under your belt. Those cravings that pop up they go away. They ALWAYS go away. Taking a risk by having even a sip of alcohol is just not worth it.
Your are awesome   IWNDWYT 
Woohoo!!!!!! Can't wait to see ya on the 1+ year sober line.   IWNDWYT 
Congrats! Here is to your Health!
