I had a whole week without drinking and decided to "treat myself" to a couple drinks with a friend. Well those two drinks turned into four and luckily I managed to go home without any more damage. The next day I discovered the guy I was dating was seeing someone else and drowned my sorrows in a bottle of wine. This was followed up by more drinking that day and I woke up the next morning throwing up and feeling terrible. Did that stop me? No of course not. I drank on Saturday and on Sunday. I'm now desperate for drink and would love any encouragement not to get some.

Oh honey I am so sorry - that is awful.  I know for me once I get started I can't stop so it is just a downward spiral of feeling like crap and self-medicating... I am now sober and feel so much better and things don't seem nearly as devastating as my nemesis alcohol wants me to believe... You will be ok don't let alcohol lie to you can you get to a meeting?..I will not drink with you tonight.
I'm sorry and I'm really glad you've reached out for some help.  How those mornings didn't deter me I'll never know but you can be stronger than that.  I've been having strong cravings lately but I will not drink with you.
Consider yourself encouraged by me.  It can be such a roller coaster - especially when relationship stuff gets thrown into the mix.  Here's my encouraging thought:  The best "revenge" you can have is to just be your best self and live a good life.  Putting the drinking away is the first step to making that happen.
