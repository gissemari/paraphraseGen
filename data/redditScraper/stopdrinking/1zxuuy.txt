Tonight was the first time I ever visited this subreddit and so so many of the things that people are saying about themselves sound extraordinarily similar...I'm 32 and definitely have a problem though like a lot of you I'm a very high-functioning alcoholic--I'm a freelancer and grad student doing just fine in terms of "life." But when I start drinking I simply can't stop--usually I'll just drink until I'm out of alcohol or I'll doze off in front of the TV...I really want to change things but I think part of the reason it's been so hard is because I know this is going to be a daily struggle--every single day I will have to actively decide not to drink. Every single day. The thought of that is utterly depressing to me... having no chance ever again of having a care-free day is nightmarish...I guess I could use some advice... or something. Not sure. I just know this is something I need to deal with.

I don't actively decide to not drink every day.  I don't even think about it. It's not a daily struggle for me.  It doesn't have to be one for you either.  I know that's really hard to comprehend when you're standing where you are right now.  I've been there.  It's hard at first.  But I'm tellin' ya it gets a lot easier.  ..Don't worry about forever.  Set a short term goal.  3 months without drinking. You can do that can't you?  That way you won't have to fear the future since you'll have that goal in mind.  Then just take it day to day.  By the time you get to three months you'll probably see things a lot differently.
What depresses me is the thought of drinking. I rarely think about it anymore since I've been sober a long time. It isn't a daily struggle; it's a satisfying life...Stop drinking one day at a time. It was overwhelming at first so that's how I stopped...one hour one morning one evening one day at a time. Things will likely get worse if you continue drinking so why not stop today?
If it didn't get better if life didn't become more enjoyable and the compulsion to drink didn't to away-no one would be sober. I thought my life was over when I decided  to admit I was an alcoholic and try to stop drinking because I absolutely hated how I felt when I was sober-it seemed like a life that wasn't worth living. I was sick of the pain and misery alcohol had brought upon me and the people around me but I genuinely didn't believe I could be sober and not want to die. I write this two years and a few months after that day and am happy and so grateful to say that I could not have been more WRONG. I never thought life could be as "okay" and even good as it is today. Some days are struggles sure but even those days come with their own type of gift. Give your self the chance to be surprised; that's the greatest thing I've done for myself. I realized that I could always choose to drink again if I felt like I had given it an honest shot and it wasn't for me I still have that option. Most days it's not even one I consider however. ..Best of luck to you you're worth an honest try.
The obsession to drink is lifted with time and active recovery. It doesn't happen overnight but I don't think about drinking anymore. It's a gift I'm grateful for but it took a lot of work. It's not a struggle to stay sober anymore but it does require I take certain actions to remain on a stable foundation. ..The most important thing I do is stay connected to other sober alcoholics in recovery through AA. It's what gave me the strength and hope to get sober initially and it's what keeps me in check and on the right path. I don't always want to go to a meeting or tell someone what's bothering me or work through my resentments but the rewards are always worth stepping outside of my comfort zone. I'm sober and I don't obsess about booze anymore. My thoughts are free to live the life I never could without alcohol. It takes daily effort but it's far from a struggle. Most importantly it **is** possible and it **is** worth it. 
Doing without liquor is a daily struggle for the first week or so. It takes a few days to get the liquor out of your system and a bit longer to get a grasp on how to pass time without a drink in your hand. Once that initial period is up the thoughts trend more towards I haven't had a drink and I feel great than I don't have a drink what am I supposed to do now?.Sobriety isn't as hard as you think it's gonna be. Good luck getting there.
