I'm struggling with today's choice to not drink.  I have wine in the fridge that I intend to dump out after tonight's Yom Kippur service and I'll probably go buy some frozen pizza instead but one problem at a time!..I've been doing pretty well lately thanks to you guys on this sub and in the last two months have managed two seven-day sober stretches which for me is a big change.  I even stayed sober at my cousins wedding although I struggled with my social awkwardness...So I'm starting day 1 again today.  IWNDWYT!

Just saw this now i hope the pizza was good! I'm worried about this weekend getting through with no drinks. I wish us both luck!
I got sober in Alcoholics Anonymous...I'm in NYC where a lot of people use wine for religious reasons...It's perfectly okay to substitute grape juice...I suggest you try a few AA meetings if only to see what all the fuss is about...Good luck.
There's something I find very useful in dealing with my social awkwardness. When you're sober and everybody else is drinking the joke's on them. Just take the time to observe how foolish they look and act. Thinking that drinking makes you less socially awkward is an illusion. It actually makes you even more awkward but just oblivious to this fact. You really don't care anymore so it looks like you're suddenly more socially able. ..In fact there's no such thing as being socially awkward. There are just different kinds of people and everyone can find their own tribe.
