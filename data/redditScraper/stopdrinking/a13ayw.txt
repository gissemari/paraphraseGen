My two friends and I downed a bottle of patron in 30 minutes I drunk texted her she said she cried. It broke my heart that I made her cry. I vowed that night that I'd try my best to never make her cry again. I poured out the rest of the booze I had in the freezer and haven't been drunk since. I know I still have a problem though it's weird but I bought a bottle of hand sanitizer because I'm sick and whenever I smell it my mind immediately goes to booze. Whenever I go to a restaurant I always think about getting drinks. I'm not struggling yet but I always think about drinking if anything alcohol related comes up.

Good for you man!!! I love that you quit bc you don't want to make her cry again . Wish you two the best . 
As a woman that has cried many times; I thank you. As a fellow human being that has an alcohol problem; I will not drink with you today. 
You should be proud of doing that for your girlfriend.  Keep going...life got better for me sober one day at a time. IWNDWYT 
It's awesome that you have realized what your girl means to you. She must mean the world to you! ..I know exactly what you're talking about. The temptations are everywhere. I still get them and it's been just shy of 8 yrs for me since I've had a drink. A couple of things that helped me out were drinking gallons of seltzer and switching to alcohol free hand sanitizer. Also really cleaning up my diet helped...So with that being said I raise my tall glass of seltzer to you and say great job keep it up! Cheers! 
Married dude here. I can for sure say my relationship has deepened and improved since I quit. Pretty much every aspect of my life has improved since I quit!
You are not alone. Keep coming back. I will NOT drink with you today! Peace
