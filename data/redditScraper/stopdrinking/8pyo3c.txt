First sober birthday in more than two decades and it was a good one!  For all of you long time strugglers out there I'm proof that you can do it too.

Happy Birthday. IWNDWYT 
I spent my 50th birthday sober and I really wish I got sober 10 years before that. It's the happiest I've ever been. Happy birthday and have a great day  
Happy Birthday!...I hope to spend my next b-day sober. Only 9 months to go....IWNDWYT!
I stopped on February 15 to see if I could go a month after drinking every day for at least 12 years and all of a sudden its been almost 4 month's. 
Happy Re\-birthday!  My 41 is coming up in a month\+ here.  It all seems to get at least slightly easier as time goes on.  No drinking with you today!
