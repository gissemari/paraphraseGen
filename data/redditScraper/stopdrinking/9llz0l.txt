Hi im on day 8 of not drinking i have been a constant skimmer of SD first time posting. I was drinking 10 to 12 drinks a night. I finally worked up the courage to stop drinking and havent had a drink for 8 days. Im struggling a bit with the cravings but more with the free time and not being able to sleep.

I joined a gym which was scary for me but once I got into the routine of going directly after work and staying on the treadmill for at least 30 min (running/walking/jogging) I found that I was just too tired to want to drink. After coming home and showering it took a good hour out of my evening.  So I wasn't as bored with my evening...
Despite resisting it and resenting it for a long time I started going to meetings and just listening to the message.It really helped with reinforcing the thought pattern of not drinking. It also helped with loneliness and in filling in the hours that were the danger zone for me. Those hours for the same as the ones you have. I went to different meetings in different places. I really wasn't comfortable enough  to share and I finally realized  that it was not  a performance review and I would not be judged. I also started going to the gym though I am a little lazy at times about that. One day at a time and knowing it's progress not perfection. I will not drink with you today or tonight at the happy hour that becomes the unhappy night!
