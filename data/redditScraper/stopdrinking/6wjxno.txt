My husband to me.  My parents came to visit on the weekend and my Mom brought wine.  She doesn't drink often but wanted to have some.  I was opening it for her and my husband hit me with that one.  Followed by "I was ONLY joking." ..He wasn't only joking though.  He would be very happy to have the old me back.  There is a feeling of safety he gets from it.  He knows how much I don't want to drink again.  It's not a struggle for me not to do so but that encouragement to drink says a lot.  He's seen the changes in me.  I've changed in ways I couldn't have imagined.  ..I wasn't hurt or upset.  I understand it and see it clearly.  I used to absorb these things and take on the hurt and then try and numb it later.  Life is so much better with a clear head.  .

You're fighting for your life. Don't forget that. I won't drink with you today.
I have this same issue with my hubby and I sometimes am confused like don't you want me healthier??? I agree life is better with a clear head
That sounds frustrating.  Here is one silver lining though: every time your husband takes on the role of "bad influence" you get to practice fighting back against those thoughts and ideas.  You get to be the voice of control and reason and every time you do it that voice gets a little stronger.
I told a friend I was trying to stop drinking and the reasons why and he said "oh you'll drink again for sure." It's weird how someone you're close to can be so unsupportive. I'm so proud you've been sober so long! I definitely won't drink with you today 
Some day he'll understand the scope of what you're going through. It's a process for those around us too. I'm sure he'll get there. In the meantime you be you!

My husband tried this and I left him. I want a supportive mate. Not one who "jokes" about this.
