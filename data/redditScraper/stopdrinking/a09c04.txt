I will may be have to explain my month or two long absence. Feels like it might be awkward. But then again I kind of only went to 7 or 8 meeting in 9 days in a kind of desperate attempt to get my shit under control...I imagine I will find the same thing: people who get it and won't judge me for going out. Any advice? Is it healthy to confront this shame about my failure like my last relapse with a group? I dunno. But last night I had a scary black out maybe from anxiety or something. I am kind of feeling I need some help beyond Reddit. I should probably go see a doctor.

No one cares. They're just glad to see you back
It's your life and your recovery.  There's no judging.  I hope you go.
I have never found a meeting to be judgmental. Relapse happens just move on and keep working it. .When you do AA you learn something about honesty. It is hard but necessary. And you also learn something about having a support group.
