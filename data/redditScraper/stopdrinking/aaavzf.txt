Stay Strong. Getting sober is almost not possible without at least 1 relapse. Its a valuable lesson no mistake. Becoming Self aware was a key for me. That's the disease fucking with you. thinking 2 beers is no big deal. Cunning Baffling and powerful.  
Welcome back. I've reset weeks in a row. You did good at two weeks and don't forget that! 
Your concise and powerful summary is helpful to those of us who are tempted by the same mirage of moderation. Thank you for sharing. I won't drink with you today! Be well. 
Holidays are tough. Invited to a party tonight. Not going. I'll hear about it later. It is easier for me to drink 12 than 2. 
I'm glad you are back here. IWNDWYT!
2 beers was kicking the door open. Then the booze train was rolling. Getting sober is a learning experience. I have fucked up so many times its ridiculous. Just keep trying keep trying. Those two words are key. Hang in there
This is a good reminder. The thing is I don't want to have one drink. I don't WANT to feel the relaxing warmth of a drink. I WANT to feel the sloppy tsunami wave of 10 drinks. And that's why I know I can't have just 1.
