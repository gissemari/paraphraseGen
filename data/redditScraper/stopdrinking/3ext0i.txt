I am in my early thirties. I have been a binge drinker for the last 18 years. During my time in high school I spent a lot of time drinking to the point of blacking out at least some part of the evening almost every time. .. ..I had been what I thought was under pretty good control for the last year or so. Not having more than a handful of times when I drank and blacked out. This weekend I had 2 evenings of being annihilated out of control not acting anything like who I would ever want to be. I have had enough. I hate the feeling of being out of control and when I abuse alcohol in any way it is always a slippery slope ending in feelings of shame guilt self hate and regret. I don't want to spend even one more morning with those feelings so I have decided that I will abstain. Finally admitting to myself that I don't have the strength to control myself when I use alcohol. I will take it one day at a time and do my best. .. ..I am not a religious person and I don't believe AA would be the path for me to take although I am not against it completely. I have never attended a meeting and I do have a good support network in my life..Hopefully I can use that support and the support of this subreddit to help me through this journey... ..Edit here to add more info:.Here is what I feel: Fear shame guilt regret..I have been focusing on being present as much as I can as I think this would help in my recovery. I am scared that there are people who will justify my bad choices and worse behaviour even if just for the fact that misery loves company. People I know will make excuses for me and try to enable me to continue the cycle of alcoholism. Whether they know the struggle that I face with alcohol or not. I am ashamed at the actions I have taken while under the influence of alcohol. I feel guilty for allowing this to continue and lying to myself that I haven't had this problem for more than half my life. I regret the hurt I have caused to others and myself. The things I have said and done without any conscious thought whatsoever as my alcohol soaked body stumbles like a plane with no pilot acting on only subconscious instincts. With all that being said I am ready to move forward. I know that alcoholics feel like shit a lot of the time because we do shitty things we have shitty thoughts and the downward spiral needs to stop for me. Wish me luck!

Just saying in my experience setting up roadblocks to what you will and will not do in early sobriety is like refusing a life preserver because you don't like it's color. 
Welcome and good luck. AA is spiritual not religious. As the difference was explained to me: Religion is for people who don't want to go to hell. Spirituality is for people who have been there and don't want to go back. If a 12-step program is not your cup of tea I would suggest seeking out a more secular alternative like SMART. Doing this alone is usually unsuccessful and generally just a bloody lonely way to go about life.
