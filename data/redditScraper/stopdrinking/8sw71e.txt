I relapsed about three months ago. Funny thing is I had no problem going back to my old ways. I know it's a part of this disease but still hate it happened. However I can't change the past but can learn from it. I was reading some of my old posts and came across one about "THIS". And I still feel the same about all of THIS but someone replied THIS &gt;THAT. For whatever reason it resonates with me. THIS is me accepting again what I am which is better than THAT avoiding what I am. So tomorrow will be day one again. And yes I've requested my badge be reset.
