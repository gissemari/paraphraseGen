Just over a year ago I posted about how drinking had made me lose my possessions a few times with one morning walking around a city centre alone and confused watching the commuters pass by after a heavy night out...It's a disappointment to say that though I was provided with vast encouragement I relapsed a year ago and subsequently deleted my post as I was ashamed of myself after relapse. I told myself moderation is the answer and I kept my drinking down perhaps drinking though excessively two to three times a week. I then cut it down to perhaps once a week when I had a high workload. Last summer I was working full time and was drinking perhaps once every few weeks at my second job. Now back for my final year as a student I've been drunk almost every day for the past three weeks drinking a bottle of liquor before going out and then drinking maybe five doubles and waking up the next morning without a hangover..... Recently I've been a demon drunk texter and subsequently have been ruining relationships by trying to bootycall multiple times a week. It's a shame because I wake up in the morning dreading what I've sent to people. For example I drunk text a girl on subsequent nights after arranging a date and I think they've become disinterested because of my constant drunk texting. If I was in that position considering I took their number perhaps a week ago I wouldn't want a guy who got drunk every night. ....My health has taken a downturn in the last few weeks from my excessive drinking- dry skin slight tremors on drifting off to sleep stomache aches and insomnia if I wasn't drinking... I really think I should stop drinking altogether but I enjoy the social element too. I don't go clubbing because I love to drink I love to dance and make friends which for me at a club seems easier if I have been drinking. ....So this is what I really want Reddit to stop drinking... To be honest I'm not sure if cold turkey is the answer considering my past performance perhaps I can ween myself off drinking by lowering my intake and then quit altogether. With consumption of .65 units of alcohol spread across 5 days in the last week as a lower estimate I think it's time for a break. ....I hope people can relate to my situation and offer some advice happy Tuesday!..Edit for my terrible formatting.

You sound confused! I can't decipher whether you really want to completely stop or want to try to cut down...lots of ambivalence!..What does your gut tell you?
Hey /u/desklamps --do you remember the [Baby Steps post?](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) You could start there worked for me...Good luck on your way back.

&gt;So this is what I really want Reddit to stop drinking..Don't think that's going to happen.   You can though.
