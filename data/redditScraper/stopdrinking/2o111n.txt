We met on the /r/drunk icanhazchat 2 years ago. We realized we lived ten minutes away from each other fell in love and etc...Now we both want to quit. We both drink a lot more than we should but I admit I'm worse of a drinker. I am a 5'5" female and go through a handle of vodka in 2-3 days..He got really worried and emotional when we were on the phone a few minutes ago and I'm afraid too. Just hearing that concerned tone in his voice makes me feel really sad...My liver and kidneys are sore but I just keep going. I've struggled with self injury and cocaine addiction before- I'm a classic addict. I'm worried I'm dying I'm worried I'm hurting him too much I'm just worried...Where do we go from here? Both of us have a desire to quit and/or cut back but it seems so impossible for me to imagine

Quit separately.  While I'm sure you rely on each other for a myriad of things do not assume that "We can get through this together."  Now is the time to seek out help from people who know the process of getting and staying sober from long experience.  ..[Alcoholics Anonymous](http://www.aa.org/) would be that kind of place.  There are others but AA is the largest and oldest 12-step recovery organization.  And its free.  You do not have to make any promises sign any pledges join any club pay any fees.  ..Just find an AA meeting near you and go there together.  Once there the best course of action would be to each separately find someone willing to talk to you one-on-one about staying sober...This may seem like a drastic proposal but it really is not.  If you don't like the people you meet at AA just find another source of support.  It won't cost you anything but an hour of your life...Of course you may also decide that you really don't want to stop after all but I would suggest that you give the AA meeting a try before going down that path.  Opportunities like the one you describe when two people come to the same decision at the same time are too rare to just pass up.
Awesome yet scary realization. I'm so glad you found us. This is a wonderful community where we lend each other strength to stay away from that next drink. ..Do you have a game plan? Usually after drinking that much we can't just stop. The mental obsession to have another drink wins out almost every time unless we have a plan in place. Also please let us know if you have any questions. If we can do it so can you :)
Welcome /u/Skolbieski to /r/stopdrinking -- at this [link is a post called the "Baby Steps" which is not a bad place to start stopping drinking.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Focus on yourself and keep your sobriety the priority--in my experience that is how I got sober anbd stayed sober..

my fiance and I met when we were drunk. the majority of our relationship was spent in bars or pubs in the beginning. 3 years later and I'm ready to quit. I'm tired and can't continue with this lifestyle anymore. I tried to quit in July and failed partially because I thought the only way I could be successful was if he did it with me. he is not ready to quit nor do I think he really needs to. whereas I have a compulsion to drink he almost drinks like a hobby. ...months later after a pretty brutal relapse and I'm ready to do it for me. take /u/pizzaforce3's advice. do it for you. you can be honest about your steps with your boyfriend but you don't need to wait for him to get sober. get sober for your health and your future. get sober for yourself. 
Communication is key. Make the SO completely aware that you are wanting to stop but that you have no expectations of them stopping unless they want to. Ask them to respect your decision and set any boundaries you feel necessary (like please don't ask me to smell how wonderful your drink is).
