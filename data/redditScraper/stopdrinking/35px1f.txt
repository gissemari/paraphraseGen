Hey Guys..I just wanted to share my experience with you drinking.  Just like most of you - I've relapsed multiple times going 94 days a few years back...That was ended when my birthday rolled around and everyone decided to throw me a party and well i told myself a little champagne wouldn't hurt right?  The next day I went and bought a 12 back and that didn't stop for years...Finally decided to stop doctor wanted my liver enzymes to go down  - so I did stopped for another 3 months then relapsed again this time - my excuse was NCAA football...This has happened a plethora of times and this last doctor's visit I was given medication AGAIN and I went a week felt perfect it was the weekend so I decided to get drunk and play videogames but then I drank on Monday...and Tuesday etc...More stories like that aside here I am again and completed one day (medicated) and now I'm onto finishing day two.  I have meds to last me a few days and to taper off.  I'd like to give you my drinking habits / tolerance and how last night was...**Habbit:** 10-18 a night minimum M-F.  On the weekends I'd drink slowly all day so I could finish 24 no problem starting at 10 AM...I decided to quit on the 10th of this month got about 2 hours of sleep...**Day 1:**  The worst shakes I've ever had luckily I had medication; however this was still by far the worst first day of not drinking I've EVER had.  Complete lethargy no appetite and could not sit still for the life of me.  The problem was the weekend before I did not eat or drink any water.  So I went into work with gatorade forced myself to eat drank tons of water etc. but it did not help until after a while.  Around 8 or so I start to get the urge to drink so I could feel better but instead I chose to take my medication as advised.  I finally feel asleep around 12am.  I got better sleep maybe 4-5 hours?  However I woke completely soaked multiple times but was still able to get some sleep...**Day 2:**  Woke up feeling a TON better no shakes was hungry (and thirsty) with energy...finally energy.  At around 9am I start getting minimal shakes in my fingers even after medication at 8am but they are extremely minimal to the point of hardly bothering me.  I just had me a good breakfast with orange juice and I'm feeling pretty good compared to yesterdays *nightmare**...Anyways guys that's it wish me luck.  Sorry for the wall of text and bad formatting...**UPDATE 3:22PM Central**  No medicine since 9am - no shakes feel great!  Had good lunch have so much energy I want to go run.  I'm going to go as long as I can tomorrow without taking meds as soon as I feel the slightest bit of symptoms I'll continue to taper off the meds.  I'll continue to update or make another thread summarizing my (hopefully many more) days of no alcohol.

Welcome and thanks for sharing...Do you plan on trying anything differently this time so an excuse like your birthday or NCAA football or video games do not change your resolve?
Are you letting people in your circle know of your decision to quit drinking? Good luck to you. We are here to give you support! :)

Damn this sounds like me. I have associated sports and things in my life with alcohol since the time I could remember. I drank a small amount last night and plan on going cold turkey tonight. I hope you can keep on we are all in this together. 
Good luck man! My last crack at sobriety was last October and my excuse to relapse was pro football. Was totally back to square 1 in a matter of 2 weeks. Again...Some of us are more stubborn than others. I've tried to maintain "controlled" drinking many times now and it always ends the same way. Eventually I'm gonna have to accept that there can be no compromise.
Good luck mate.  After a week you'll have so much energy you wouldn't believe.  Thanks for sharing and good luck again.   
I'm on day 2 myself and I'm already feeling much better but  I definitely know how hard it is to keep it up; "I've been doing so well this one time won't hurt."...Stay strong.
