A friend for the last fifteen years who I have been drinking with for oh fifteen years got married this weekend. I know he's not on here but I want to give him and all of the friends like him out there a big shout out. ..He knew of my previous attempt to get sober knew about my relapse a few months back but didn't know of my renewed effort to get back on the wagon over the holidays. Not once during the expectedly booze filled reception did he or his family some of who also knew about my sobriety pressured me into drinking. I've imbibed many an adult beverage with his entire family and no one cared that I was ordering tonic and cranberries. ..Another shoutout to another old homey that was there that quit a little over a year ago and still going strong...I feel like these understanding friends are the ones that we sometimes forget about and I just think everyone should remember them more often. I know I need to..

I think the imagination of sobriety is worse than the actuality.  I imagine being pressured.  The reality is that most drinkers only care about their own buzz.  
Thanks for sharing! There are a lot of posts (and a lot of us experience) pressure to drink. It's refreshing and encouraging to hear about positive interactions like yours!
