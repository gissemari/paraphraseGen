I don't know how else to say it but I am *back*!..This feels amazing. It's only taken a couple days for me to get back to that place where I was when I got my seven months sober. ..It's amazing how relapse can happen so quickly in just a couple days you can go from sober to daily drinker again but it's also amazing how much difference just a few days sober makes...I decided tonight to stop smoking as well. I just left my last half pack of cigarettes on a bench by the side of the road and walked away from them...I had this realization that every time I was smoking a cigarette it was sucking a little piece of my self confidence away. I was telling myself that I wasn't worth caring for. I was telling myself my health wasn't important...But the last couple weeks have really helped me see that I AM important and I AM worth caring for. ..Thanks /r/stopdrinking for still being here and for helping me get back on the horse. It feels great and I hope I can help everyone else here as much as you've helped me. ..Even in the times when I thought I had given up I would still come read posts here it feels great to be able to contribute and be a part of this amazing community again...<3 you all!
