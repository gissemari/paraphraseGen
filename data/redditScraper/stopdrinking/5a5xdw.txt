I am 4 days sober and had been planning on posting an introduction this afternoon. My dog woke me up early this morning making lots of weird noises and struggling to walk. I ended up having to take her to the emergency vet. ..I was at a Halloween party last night and debated on having a drink. SO glad that I didn't take that first sip because I can never be sure what will happen after that first drink and I'll be damned if I couldn't be there for my pup!

That's great. On Halloween I usually put a fire pit in the driveway sit in the lawn chairs have some cocktails and hand out the candy. Tomorrow it will be warm apple cider and I'm looking forward to it. ..I will not drink with you today! 
I hope your dog is okay!!  It's the best feeling to realize you can be there for those that need you....(((hugs)))!
So glad you were there for your dog.  I have two (one is really old) and they are helping me when I crave.
