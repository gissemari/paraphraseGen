Hi folks! I've been lurking this sub for about 6 months and decided it's high time I introduce myself. ..&amp;#x200B;..I've been struggling to define my relationship with alcohol. For the last two years I've wondered on and off if I was heading towards a problem. On one hand I didn't do a lot of the 'traditional' alcoholic behaviours like blacking out drinking in the morning or even drinking every day. I didn't drink that much either odd party aside a night at the pub wouldn't exceed two pints (though I'm a real lightweight - that was more than enough to get me drunk!) But I began noticing things. For example I'd be at an event with casual drinking have a taste and kick off a real internal battle against carrying on and getting hammered (or get hammered anyway - this happened a few times). Then I'd take a few days off drinking and be fine. But once I'd have a drink it would kick off several days in a row of craving it. It was like if I was 'off' drinking I was ok but if I was 'on' it was REALLY hard to get off! ..On top of that I loved the feeling of being tipsy. I'd feel this absolute sense of relief kicked in like 'ahh this is how I'm supposed to feel!' I didn't enjoy or really taste my drinks - it was all about getting drunk and staying there. ..So not so bad I could control it often enough though with great effort. Recently though I did some things that I did not like. This spring I got the drunkest I've ever been. After finishing the beer I had (which I'd consumed with a friend) I then wandered the streets of my neighbourhood overwhelmed by a surge of emotions about random things from my past openly sobbing. All I wanted was to buy more beer so I could keep drinking (alone). I didn't succeed went home and vomited - I was WAY too drunk! Then I was so stressed by work one day that I came home and started drinking wine at 4pm ending up drowsy and mildly hungover for a gathering later that evening. Occasionally if I had a free evening I'd get drunk for lack of anything else to do. I also abandoned a relaxed afternoon of pizza and beer with my partner because he was done drinking but I'd had a taste and wanted to get smashed so I made an excuse to leave bought beer and drank it at home alone to hide all this from him. ..Sometimes I made healthier choices but when I chose drink it felt mildly dysfunctional and I finally decided to quit before it escalates. Funnily enough I'd been thinking that this was a recent thing and that I'd never done stuff like this before but upon reflection that's not true! I went through a phase in my early twenties where sometimes out of boredom I'd just chug vodka at 3 in the afternoon. Or spend every day of the two week Christmas holidays drunk from mid-morning onwards. Again it was only the odd occasion so I didn't fixate on it and moved on easily. But it feels more difficult to control now so I am making a real effort. ..However you define it I just didn't have a good relationship with alcohol. Reading this sub has been a great help for me to normalize a life of not drinking and for tips and tricks! I've reached out to sober friends as well which has been very helpful. Community is everything it seems! ..Thanks for reading my story. IWNDWYT!
