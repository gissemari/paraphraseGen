Checking in to say I've been sober for three weeks today. It's been kinda tough since I had some pretty strong urges to have some beers over the weekend but I kept the bottle away. But once I started having some life savers the craving went away. Thank you for the advice of having something sugary to tame those cravings. Just kinda funny that I bought life savers since that's actually what there doing lol. Also had a relapse dream were me and my wife were having shots of Crown Royal. Man it seemed so real I could taste it. But I'm not going to drink with you today whiskey peace out. Happy Easter everyone!!

Happy Easter 
Lifesaving Lifesavers!! Congratulations on 3 weeks! Those first weeks are the worst by far. Someone said to me in the beginning "You never have to feel like this again"! That has helped me off some hairy ledges. Keep it up!  I will not drink with you! 
Awesome! Keep it up. You noticing any health benefits yet? If not I bet you're wallet is noticing.
Great job with your 3 weeks! Hope you have a great April 
Well Done My Friend! 3 weeks feels good! Now on to the month mile marker! I'll see you there!!!

Well done!  Three weeks is great! I found that after three weeks the days really started to pick up momentum and it got easier. I just try to focus on the day I'm in.... ..IWNDWYT
