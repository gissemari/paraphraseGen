**EDIT: It's a bit long I just realized. Yikes! TLDR at bottom**..It's hard for me to put myself into the shoes of a lot of folks here. I know I know ... everyone thinks their situation is "unique" or that they're somehow different or special. We're really not we're all addicts of some kind. My circumstances however did play an important role getting me sober I think. ..I had tried to just go cold turkey and it never worked. In the back of my mind somewhere deep inside me I still clung to some kind of hope that I'd be able to drink again someday. I never fully nuked that part of me for good. I never agressivley cut that cancerous growth out 100%. ..I think there's something to be learned from my experience.....When I got arrested for my 2nd DUI is when I got sober. I spent 3 nights/4 days in jail (more than the 72 hour requirement). I detoxed in a cell. Thankfully even after 10 years of daily drinking over 8 drinks I didn't have horrible withdrawals. Some paleness the sweats/hot flashes no major shakes or anything though. ..When I finally got out I was on 3rd party supervision. Now there wasn't anyone that could vouch for me and spend 100% of their time by my side. No I was signed up for electronic 3rd party custody. What is that? It's an ankle monitoring program by a private company. It's even more accurate than the Dept. of Corrections ankle monitors. I had an "officer" in charge of my "case" and I had to call and schedule any movements outside my home 24 hours in advance. Their monitoring center had banks of computer screens with what looked like Google Earth. Places that sold booze (bars liquor stores) were geo-fenced in red. If I went into one of those places someone would come after me. ..Now these guys weren't rent-a-cops. Mine was a former Marine. Huge guy and nice enough -- but he did get serious and ominous when he said I better not wake him up and force him to track me down to be hog tied and taken back to the jail. ..On top of not having a car and being restricted where I went I also had an in-home breathalyzer. This thing had a cell phone inside it and took my picture each time I used it. I had to blow into the thing 6 times a day. I had to wait at least an hour and a half between uses so I had to learn to schedule those blows. I had a white board with tick marks on my fridge. ..I lived like this for THREE MONTHS. Even if I somehow convinced the monitoring people to let me to go the grocery store and bought alcohol I wouldn't pass the breathalyzer. I couldn't get someone else to blow because it took a picture. ..I was quite literally forced to remain sober for three months while the prosecutors/DA/cops bungled around getting discovery material to my lawyer. The meantime I was draining my finances paying for this insanely expensive 3rd party crap. ..I finally had my time in court got sentenced and off the 3rd party ankle monitor. That wasn't it though -- my girlfriend at the time demanded that I voluntarily opt for an "alcohol restricted" endorsement be added to my license. It's a red stripe that says "ALCOHOL RESTRICTED" and prevents anyone from serving me/selling me booze. It was going to be for 5 years possibly more. ..The DA/prosecutor had never seen anyone voluntarily do this. Normally this is something handed down in sentencing for felony DUI (mine wasn't a felony). A bit confused they OK'ed it. The judge even raised an eyebrow. ..I had to do 30 days on a corrections ankle monitor after my court sentencing. That ankle monitor had a built-in skin contact that detected alcohol in the body. So for another month my movement was watched/restricted as well as my body for alcohol. ..Even after the house arrest ankle monitor was taken off I didn't have a car. I had a huge red stripe on my ID. ..After 18 months I finally got the ability to drive again restored. I still have a red stripe on my ID/license. I can't go into bars. I can't buy alcohol. I can't order a drink. Where I live they DO card people very carefully at restaurants. ..I think for me personally it was what I needed. ..Sure an alcoholic will find a way. We always do. However during those first few critical months I needed to have any hope/idea of how to get a drink totally erased from my mind. No possible way. As the chains slowly loosened up on me bit by bit as more and more of my freedom returned I found that I had grown used to being sober. I liked it. I wanted to STAY sober!..Some people do 30 or 60 days in an in-patient and that's good...but I needed the 5 months of strict breathalyzer blows and ankle monitoring. During this time I was also attending an out-patient program 4 nights a week. ..I guess I wish all of the stuff I had to do was more affordable for all alcoholics. I wish more people could be put into the ankle monitors/breathalyzers and forced to just give up drinking. ..It took the edge off my anxiety about wanting to drink because I knew 100% that I couldn't. I couldn't get away with it. I couldn't sneak it. It was pretty air-tight and it helped me grow used to the idea. I just threw up my hands and said "well that's that. It's really over."..Even now when I see my license I'm reminded. I'm reminded what a nightmare my life became and how hard I've worked since. ..I needed what I went through and I think it helped me through the most delicate first few months. It simply was NOT an option to relapse. I literally had no choice and couldn't. I was forced to abandon and destroy any hope of feeding my alcoholism. When I combined that with the hard work I put into my out-patient treatment -- I find myself where I am today -- 805 or so days sober happily now married and pursing new life goals wanting to help others. ..Maybe what I went through was extreme vs. just sitting around cold turkey but it was what I needed. And if it was cheaper to do I think some folks could really benefit from it like I did. ..**TL;DR: Had to be on ankle monitoring and breathalyzers for 4 months and now have an ID that restricts alcoholic purchases. I honestly think these things were a big help in making me realize I was now sober for good.**..Thank you for reading!
