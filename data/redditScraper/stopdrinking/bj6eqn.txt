I drank this weekend Friday and Sunday night. It was probably the worst relapse I've had. I drank two bottles of whiskey with my friend and kept threatening to shoot myself. I had a loaded gun in my hand. I think I've finally hit rock bottom. I am so scared what would happen if I drank again. I can't do this anymore. I have no energy I am depressed and I keep trying to remind myself of the crazy things that happen when I drink. Why am I like this? When I'm sober I'm the most energetic person and am motivated but I seem to keep talking myself into just having one and then one turns into blacking out and doing all of these crazy things. Help meeeee

Be kind to yourself. It's a small one but still the victory.
