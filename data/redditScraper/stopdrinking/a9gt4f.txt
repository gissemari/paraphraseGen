Hi everyone!..Happy holidays! Or tolerable holidays as the case may be. I'm spending Christmas with my sister who lives locally and her family. My sister was watching an eight week old goldendoodle puppy for a neighbor family overnight and I got to spend Christmas morning with the puppy snuggled up and sleeping on my lap which was pretty sweet. I'd like to get a dog at some point down the road but I'm not at that place in my life right now so it was a fun opportunity to get puppy time without the commitment...I'm grateful to be with people who care about me and who I can trust. I feel very lucky to have family around who don't drink and who are loving and supportive. It's been an almost completely stressless holiday for me and for that I am extremely grateful...I'm also grateful for all of the friends that I've met in sobriety both on here and in real life. I feel like I've got a group of people in my life who I can trust who accept me for who I am and who I can count on. I have fewer friends than I used to but more real relationships and I wouldn't go back to the way things were in my drinking days even if I could...I hope that you all are enjoying the day wherever you are and if you're struggling I hope that you are able to reach out for and find the support that you need. I'm grateful for all of you being here...Ginger_Sprout Out
