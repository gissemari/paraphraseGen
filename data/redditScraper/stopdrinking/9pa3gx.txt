Hi everyone how's your day going?..Just doing my epic daily check-in. I didn't make it to a meeting last night. I had a cooking/brain malfunction that took longer to fix than it probably should've. I was making a big pot of soup so I'd have leftovers to freeze (the secret of cooking for one) and making it to my usual meeting would've meant abandoning a bunch of food mid-process. I was also just tired which probably contributed to everything taking too long...I've gotten a ton out of doing my 90 in 90 (currently sitting at 85 AA meetings + 3 other support group meetings in 84 days.) It has been good to get into the habit of just going to meetings without expectations beyond getting my butt in the chair. But I'm feeling a little like I need to start putting more time into the actual work of recovery. Going to meetings is good but I've done that before without really working a program and eventually I just sorta stopped going and then eventually I relapsed. So I know that just going to meetings is not enough to keep me sober so I need to do more...I didn't call that woman again last night about being my sponsor. I don't know I just got cold feet and started overthinking it. Maybe she's too busy? Maybe I should try to find a sponsor who's closer? But really at this point I just need a flippin' sponsor. I am trying to make it happen but I could probably also try harder...I was reading the [ACA text](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0978979702/ref=dbs_a_w_dp_0978979702) last night (Adult Children Of Alcoholics Alcoholic/Dysfunctional Families) and I came across a bunch of stuff that relates equally to what I'm dealing with in addressing my alcoholism. I'm just going to quote verbatim a couple of things that I underlined...p. 50:  Discovery is marvelous but recovery is the focus.  (Discovery is the stage where you're learning all about the problem and learning new things about yourself recovery is the work that actually addresses it.).. Our experience has shown that we cannot read ourselves into a change.  (Me:   *But... but....*  ).. We simply become information gatherers which is a form of control itself. If we are simply reading about recovery ... we still think we can reason out a solution without doing the actual work of recovery. Our experience shows that we cannot recover alone.  (I'm not as stuck in this stage as I have been previously I'm making progress but I recognize that still have a ways to go.)..p. 51:  We ask new members to avoid some hinderances to recovery that include: isolating and not asking for help intellectualizing the program focusing only on counseling  falling in love  with another member and avoiding meeting work (I think that one refers more to becoming besties with someone or idolizing someone rather than strictly romance) erratic meeting attendance and taking drugs or drinking alcohol. We suggest that newcomers to ACA stay out of romantic relationships since we need time to focus on ourselves. We are highly susceptible to unhealthy attachments which can divert us from focusing on ourselves.  (I'm already pretty on board with all of that but it's nice having it spelled out.)..p. 65:  In ACA we seek help from our false selves and our obsessive nature to harm ourselves. Because of our addictiveness we choose a variety of methods to do ourselves in. Many adult children use a combination of drugs food sex and relationships to harm themselves emotionally and physically.  (Yup.)..p. 68:  All ACA bottoms have one thing in common: self-abandonment. While our actions can harm others we ultimately harm ourselves by running from ourselves. We can believe we are not worth saving. Most bottoms are emotionally painful unless the adult child is dissociating from reality. The pain varies due to our ability to switch over to other soothing compulsions...The level of pain that adult children can tolerate without admitting they have hit a bottom is astonishing. Being adult children we have learned to endure colossal amounts of abuse and aloneness that only we understand.  (Yup.)..So the long story short of this is that I will have to (eventually) get a second sponsor and work a second program. This book is totally me. My entire goal in life is to not turn into my parents which they *talk* about in here that's *everyone's* biggest fear apparently. And unless you do the work to deal with your shit you are doomed to turn into your parents. I'd run a karaoke bar for the tone deaf if that would keep me from becoming my mom I can work a second program...But first I gotta work a *first* program. I'm volunteering tonight and trying to wedge in a meeting beforehand but I'll give her a call when I get out. Fingers crossed!..I hope that life is treating you all well. Stay safe out there sobernauts and keep the faith!..Ginger_Sprout Out

Yep I stayed home n the  Discovery  phase waaaay too long...It's a program of Action!..The posts that offer  I just want to understand *why*...  are signals that I'm  still in my thoughts  rather than my actions...The antidote to  why' is Action verbs. I collect them!..
