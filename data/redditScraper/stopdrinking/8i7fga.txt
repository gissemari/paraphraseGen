It's not \*that\* huge of a mistake but there's some context/background. About a year ago my boss pulled me into a sit down and mentioned that she noticed I was kind of squeaking by in terms of attendance and hours \(I'm salaried\) and she'd like to see more effort. ..I agreed and for the most part I did well\-\-\-showing up on time leaving on time making meetings being available etc. This was all when I was sober. When I was still drinking I really struggled\-\-\-call offs and "working from home" were much more common. ..But for some reason now that I'm sober I'm still doing the same thing: skating by shaving time working from home with any excuse etc. ..Yesterday I specifically came in early so I could leave early and missed a meeting scheduled after I left for the day. Normally wouldn't be a big deal...if I hadn't had a couple similar incidents in that last six months one just a couple months ago. ..I already apologized and don't think my job is at risk but my boss was like you have to get this scheduling stuff under control or we'll have to take you off the project. Ugh. Okay time to tighten up my game and make sure I don't miss anything else. But it's just...hard. It's like my mind is on vacation all the time. I'm super angry bitter and frustrated at some policy changes and I am really struggling to get over those. ..I'm demotivated and demoralized in my 9\-5 job and I also have a side gig and a part time job. I could let the side gig go/put on pause for now but I don't want to quit the part time job it's kind of keeping me going. I can't leave the 9\-5 I'm the primary breadwinner for my household and I live in a high COL area. ..I feel like I'm still doing stupid hungover/drinking mistakes\-\-\-skating by on technicalities minimizing poor choices robbing Peter to pay Paul etc. I've been in therapy for 6 months and just put \*that\* on pause because I felt like it was a poor match between myself and the therapist. ..Now that I'm sober I feel I have no excuses and would really look askance at someone else doing stuff like this. ..Why? ..how do I get over this type of mentality? Like the anger bitterness and frustration that only causes me to hurt myself?

What I hear a lot is that if you sober up a drunk horse thief you have a sober horse thief. ..For me alcohol was not the problem it was the solution. Now I have new solution options. I can use those on my problems (or not) but one thing I know for sure is that I can't blame alcohol for the way I act any more.
My brain was not firing correctly for at least a year. Sometimes it takes awhile...But if you are unmotivated and angry at work maybe moving on would not be a horrible idea. I would obviously weigh my options and find something else prior to making a change but we spend so much time at work. Why be miserable?..Congrats on 8 months btw. That's awesome.
Have you talked to your therapist about this? I am not a doctor but some of those things can be symptomatic of ADHD. You might want to talk to your GP about those concerns. 
Hey I can relate. Although I haven't missed work since getting sober and am on time 99% of the time I'm still often behaving the same as when I was hungover 24/7 - laziness cutting corners bad attitude. I don't dislike my job either. I guess old habits/thought patterns are hard to break.
