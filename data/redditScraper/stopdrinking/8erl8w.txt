It is amazing how being tired affects our mood willpower and attitude to alcohol.  For the last two days I have been really tired as I had a lot on.  I didn't exactly get a craving or relapse but I felt my drinking mind was closer than normal.  I got sleep last night andfeel better.  It is worth bearing in mind!!

It's very worth keeping in mind. There's a reason that Hunger Anger Lonely Tired Stressed (HALTS) is such an effective checklist...Glad you got some rest and are feeling better.
