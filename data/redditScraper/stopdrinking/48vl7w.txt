Good morning/afternoon/evening!..*Theme*: Acceptance    ..*Today's Quote:* **"We must be willing to let go of the life we planned so as to have the life that is waiting for us."**    ..-- [Joseph Campbell](http://mobile.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/j/josephcamp386014.html?src=t_inspirational)..*What I get from it:* I struggle to replace resentment with acceptance. I can't change the past. I don't have all of the skills or intelligence of my friends and colleagues. But I can recognize my own value and strengths and go from there.    ..Have an awesome day!

I like that a-lot. 
You are awesome for doing these quotes!  I look forward to them every day. Thank you &lt;3
I needed this one today. [Way to go Larry! ;)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gikx3o7KcYU)
I can't though. I'm trying so hard to finally live the life I had planned for myself 15 years ago before I started drinking and using. That's the life I want and why I'm trying to live sober. I want to give it up so bad but I can't give up my hopes for the future
.Oh goodness in between the learning curve anyway at least a quarter of my struggle was the crashing gap of what to do once I was struggling to let my old life go!..But I am beginning to settle into the life waiting for me and the SD set of this board and the chat are turning the corner for me!..
Love it!!!   Thank you.....   I live your quotes!
Nice one Larry. I think the quote is kind of a two part idea. I read it as saying don't live in the future. Live in the now as the future hasn't happened yet and anything can happen between now and then. In my experiences when I try to control aspects of my future I end up disappointed because things don't go how I wanted them to go therefore I get upset and that usually leads to anger/resentment. This is when Larry Sellers idea kicks in: Then you look back in regret and feel even worse...Like Sellers said replacing resentment with acceptance is pivotal in moving forward in the right direction. Thanks for sharing.
hmm... I dont know if I like this one maybe I am not ready for acceptance. I planned a much different for life for myself (single military traveling) but got married and threw it all to the wind which lead me down a path to becoming an alcoholic... maybe more future this will be true..... ? 
Ha! Before I stopped drinking I had a plan for when my wife divorced me. I would buy a trailer next to some dive bar and drink till I was gone. Nice plan huh? Today the plan is to not get divorced. Today the plan is to be the best husband and father I can be. The trick is to not beat myself up for falling short in that area. I am not perfect and I need to take it all as it comes. Family work life ... They all have their own terms. Happy Friday!
This reminds me that I could have everything or alcohol. I think I know which one I'll choose. Great post thanks!
Great Quote!   Big JC fan.  Follow Your Bliss!..
/u/larry_sellers_ do you live inside my head or what :) your quotes have been on point lately...I relate to this one strongly. believing myself and my life to be failures (not matching the person/life I planned) is largely what drove me to drink the past few years away. I'm slowly learning to accept who I am where I am and letting go of these bullshit expectations that ultimately hold me back from growing. ..if you're interested in a *super nerdy story* I'm actually planning my next tattoo around the "failed" Apollo 13 lunar mission. it's a simple b/w drawing of the [crew's trajectory](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Apollo_13_timeline.svg/800px-Apollo_13_timeline.svg.png) (without all those reference points) from the earth to the moon and back again without ever actually landing on the moon.  I've always been inspired by this story and it's especially fitting for my struggle and change in early sobriety. it's all about accepting the current situation - and teamwork grace and ingenuity under extreme pressure. I'll write a whole post about it soon but wanted to mention it here because it's so relevant to your great quote...*edit for typoz
