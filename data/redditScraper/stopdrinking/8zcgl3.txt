I woke up at about 3am reliving the edges of relapse dream the details are now fuzzy but I remember having been so drunk in it that I had somehow stumbled in my shoes and two of my toenails had been partially pulled off. Blood welled from my blackened feet. It was extreme. It was some kind of prestigious black tie event and there were people I knew there and I was a mess. ..As I was slowly emerging from this dream I was in despair and utterly disgusted at myself- how in the hell did I get there! I've been sober for a year and I'd thrown it away in spectacular fashion worse than I had ever had before (way way way WAY worse I was never a messy drunk). ..Slowly I came to the realization I was in my bed and not remembering the aftermath of a bad night. I was in my bed after having gone to bed sober at a reasonable time. Apparently something in my subconscious really needed to remind myself why I got sober and where it could all head if I fall off. I do question why my subconscious needed to get so brutal with it but I'm thankful for another sober day!

Relapse dreams can be so vivid and can be something that sticks with you throughout the day! It's really telling though - the unconscious and subconscious mind is fascinating!.
I have those dreams. Just read that dreams can be our brain's way of working past trauma while we are unconscious. So maybe our brains are helping us in a way while we sleep.
