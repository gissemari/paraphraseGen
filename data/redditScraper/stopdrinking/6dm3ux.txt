today someone offered me a beer at the pool I said "no thanks bro" and I felt really good almost high. Its still a struggle but every day I feel better about quitting.

Well done! Every time you say no you get better at it and it feels so good

As silly as it may sound saying no to someone else means saying yes to yourself and that is what matters most right now. Feels good to be in control doesn't it? 
NDV - way to go!!!
