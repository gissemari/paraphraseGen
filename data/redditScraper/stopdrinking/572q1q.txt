Another relapse. Another disappointment. Another relationship ruined. I've got to be better.

I wish you the best of luck this time around. Let's not drink tonight!
I've just gone through it again myself. Thought I had it this time.
Another new day!  Then another and another and another.... you know they string together you've done it. Fresh string. I wont drink with you today!!!~~~~~~~(string)
I'm glad to be here with you. Proud that you have the grit to return and keep fighting...I have seen it written that if you want different you have to do different...What are you going to do different this time?
Thanks for all the support! I need to stop kidding myself and thinking that I can control this and accept that I need to entirely avoid alcohol.
Not drinking with you :)
Good luck. You can do this. :-)
I have been through a few day 1s myself. You can do this. I will not drink with you tonight
Well glad that you're here. We're here for you and good luck today. I will not drink with you today.
