But you know what's funny? They are the SOBER cravings...This is round three for me (unfortunately). But yesterday  I was driving and my mouth started literally watering for some La Croix. I never drink fizzy water when drunk but my body seemed to remember how it helped when sober. So I stopped for a 12 pack...Yesterday was a day off and I haven't had one it 2 weeks so I planned to do nothing but veg around. But I couldnt. My body was screaming at me to work out then clean house...My girlfriend wanted an easy dinner and that usually means greasy fast food (fine on the occasion but consumed WAY to often when drinking) but that sounded disgusting to me. (When sober I am much more health conscious) so instead I went to the grocery store and picked up some light sandwiches and soup. Then going to bed later when my body said I actually should I crashed like a baby and got restful sleep...I am grateful my body and not just my mind remembered the good habits I built. And if anyone reading this has relapsed maybe yours will too.

Hahaha you got me with the title!..That's brilliant - and yeah the craving for Fizzy Water is *real* who'd have ever thought it?..Fizzy-Water-Cheers to new healthy habits healthy minds and healthy bodies - I won't drink booze with you today!..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Yep. I know. Hard stuff those cravings. ..You NEED to get through this. It will get a little bit easier over time but it has to have time...And then one day day after you have not really had anything but a dull roar for cravings six ten months from now It will sneak up behind you and hit you with a shovel...I try to tell everyone this I may have missed. ..You need a cubic fuckton of Orange Juice. Pound it. Same with Water. If you do not have to pee right now drink more...Eat four five bananas every day for the next week. ..You have been dumping poison into your body daily for years and the metabolites need to be washed out. Your are in active detox and will be for ten days or so...It is very rare that it is actually physically dangerous so don't freak out about it...You will hear people tell you that you need to be medically treated probably not if you are not having active hallucinations...Water alone will deplete the minerals and enzymes and you will end up feeling worse. You need the OJ and Fruit. No shit. Muscle cramps on top of this will not be fun...We are here and have done this. Reach out. Even better lose any preconceptions you have and go find a meeting. Hang out with a real live sober alcoholic...It makes it so much easier to be able to talk with someone else who knows.....
