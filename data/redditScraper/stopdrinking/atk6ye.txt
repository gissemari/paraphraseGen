I know I'm doing the right thing for myself but it's been hard to get through the random bouts of anxiety I feel on my free time and in the evenings. It always passes and I'm proud every time I make it through but damn is it hard. I find cleaning  and doing projects around the house helps immensley. Working out helps me so much but it's so hard for me to just get to the gym let alone leave my house when I'm  feeling anxious. You tube workout videos are great for times like this but I know it would be better to get out of the house. I turned down a social event today because I knew I couldn't handle it sober and I obsessed over what to tell the host of the event who is also my coworker for days. I'm still worried about what he might think of me cancelling when I was so on board for the event in person. I struggle with putting my health before appearing normal if that makes any sense. I'm hoping with time I won't feel like I have to drink to hang out with people and not worry so much about what other people think. Just some thoughts ..thanks for listening! IWNDWYT

You are still in end of alcohol withdrawal. The anxiety is still a withdrawal symptom. Your brain is so accustomed to the depressant effects of alcohol abuse that it tries to balance itself by creating anxiety-inducing stimulants. When you remove the alcohol your brain will slowly stop making the stimulants. Unfortunately it can't just switch it off...it takes time to gradually return to a normal baseline. Hang in there. You WILL feel better I promise.
One of the tricks that I have learned through therapy and meditation is to try not to get caught up in the anxious thoughts.  You take note of them and say "ok here is some anxious thought I'm going to put that away or let that go for now" without judging it.  I have found it helpful but it takes work and practice and I'm still getting there.  I also have generalized anxiety disorder so even when the withdrawal anxiety subsided which was horrendous I have a lot of anxiety.
