In fact I would have relapsed yesterday already. The alcohol is one aisle next to the cat food. After putting the cat food into my basket I was automatically pulled towards the wine. My mind definitely wanted the wine but my body refused. I once had a food poisoning with a melon. This was 30 years ago but still today when I see a melon I start shaking I feel like vomitting. The same yesterday with the wine. I'm only sober since 18 days and even though I was trying to label the alcohol as poison as suggested here this was too short of a time to sink in. On the other hand my body started refusing the wine some months ago already. The first glass was like taking a bad tasting medicine. Very often I had to lenghten it with water. Anyway this safed me yesterday but I doubt this will happen again I feel it building up since days and I don't know what to do against it. Actually my body is feeling well but I'm so depressed and from HALT I've everything except the hunger.... I know that staying sober will give me the freedom to make changes in my life but at the moment I only think "what for".

Well done for sticking at it and resisting that urge.  
It was so bad for me that I started shopping after the tine alcohol sales were prohibited for the night.  It gets easier. 
Keep it up! IWNDWYT
Kudos for 18 days /u/Decembernight11!..Staying sober is hard. I had to clue how to do it so I got help from a therapist and AA. I needed to learn how to deal with personal issues life's frustrations and my emotions. Therapy and AA meetings gave me the tools I needed to build the sober happy life I have today. ..Sobriety is easier and more fun with help.
