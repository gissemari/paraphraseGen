Despite a brief moment of confusion(and hope) this morning I'm sitting here at 17^2 days. In terms of mileage I had an unrealistic A goal of 900 miles (30^2) then B and C goals. I didn't make it. I'm 12 miles short of C (841). ..I got really tired - the cry through my drive home every day kind of tired. Tired of worrying and being sad tired of feeling like I should be doing more that nothing is ever good enough - just profoundly tired...I actually returned to work today after two weeks off. I didn't go anywhere just tried to deal with projects I've been putting off and catch up with friends. This should have been more relaxing than it was but historically I haven't always dealt well with a large amount of time to myself. Being home with no obligations is as much a trigger to me as going away with friends. Stronger in a way because I'm left to ramble about in my head for too long...I got past it and I was actually pretty productive. I managed to get through all of my closets and quite a few boxes of life debris. I really went through things and let go of quite a bit. I spent at least 6 of the days visiting people which is something I rarely have time to do but is very important to me. I just had to let go of the goal of getting everything done. ..And I ran much less than I thought I would. I was tired and actually in pain and finally realized that pushing this way would be counter-productive. This whole month has been difficult in a number of ways...So I'm sitting here with 841 looming one long run away...the long run I was planning when my friends called to see if we were still making soap that day. I chose the friends and fun with lye. :) .I made a new goal just this weekend when I realized I wasn't going to make it - If I can't make it to a perfect square I can at least run 100 miles since the last one. I overcame my inner slug and reached that one today...Somewhere along the muddled way I remembered that I started this as a celebration. I turned 36 I turned Krypton - this was going to be my year. My goal back in the darkness of February was to run the square of my age in kilometers over the course of this year. That's the one I reached some time last week. There was no fanfare no announcement. It happened somewhere in the middle of a run and I kept going. But that really was the most important goal. That was the first long-term commitment - the first time I really decided to keep going. So that's what I'm celebrating today. The 1296 km that I ran past that gave me hours of thought lessons in endurance humility and self-acceptance and despite struggles the strength to believe I can simply keep going....On and on and on...;)

I LOVE your goal math. I think of things in this way as well and I try and keep in mind that what's on the other side of the = symbol is a moving target but dang if that isn't the hardest thing to remember. I have been trying to clean my closet for four years now. I'm not sure if that makes me a bad person or just someone with a lot of soap.
