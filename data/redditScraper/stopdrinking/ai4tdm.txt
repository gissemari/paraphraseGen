I am really loving my life right now sober! I've tried to be sober many times and always have failed at two weeks. I had a really exciting spring/summer/fall living in a National Park but it involved a lot of heavy drinking falling into a depressed state again where I for awhile never left my room and just drank and watched tv alone while in such a beautiful place. I gained some weight back that I had lost earlier in the summer. I got my heart broke right before leaving (alcohol is the reason it even began and also the reason it didn't end well) and a few days later flew across the country to move back to my boring small town for the winter. I was still sad so I drank a lot the first few weeks home. Gained some more weight back. Drinking others' alcohol that wasn't mine. Hiding cans and bottles like I used to from my family. Back into my old disgusting habits that have not changed for years now. Back to the me that I've grown tired of. It's like I had just resigned myself that change was too hard so now I was just always going to be this garbage person. How could I get back to who I was before the depression and alcoholism started?..I finally decided that enough was enough. Part of it was the heartbreak motivating me to better my life so the next time I see this dude or any future dude I will be the best version of myself: sober and 100% me. Knowing that I am worthwhile and fun without the mask of alcohol. Part of it was that I told myself I wasn't going to waste away and drink until I'm at my highest weight again while home for a few months that instead I was going to use those months to be strict with myself better myself and be focused on my goals...I've been able to do all of these things since being sober! I have so much more time on my hands and I feel so much healthier. I also cut out most processed foods am experimenting with IF have applied to jobs for my next adventure go to the gym 5 or 6 days a week (when I'm bored I just go instead of drinking) am down to smoking only two or three cigarettes a day instead of a pack and am being cross-trained as a bartender at work (ironic that it happens while sober haha!). ..I have no desire to drink anymore this time and regularly turn down the free drink we're offered after every work shift. The only tastes of alcohol I've had are while taste-testing the drinks I'm learning to make to know if I made it properly. I'm feeling totally comfortable bartending instead of being worried about drinking again I'm instead filled with excitement and desire to learn something new. It's actually really fun to be creative and make drinks when you're not thinking about consuming them and have no desire to. It's purely a craft to be honed. ..All in all I see no relapsing in sight this time around. I've got so many good things going for me and I can thank it all to being sober. IWNDWYT :)
