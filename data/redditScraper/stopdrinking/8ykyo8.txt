I am almost at day 100 and that is super cool. I plan to keep doing this and stay sober for the rest of my life... which is a daunting thought but one day at a time right? I keep having this " now what?" feeling. I know how I should get a hobby exercise do something. We all just get so used to that automated responses - I'm awake time to smoke weed I am off work its time to drink alcohol...I guess that's why I need to go to AA. It breaks that automated response. I can't go right now because I have the kids...I'm also struggling a bit because I I do work in bars. One of my side hustles is to play music. I mainly play shity cover songs to drunken tourist. I can't quit now because the money is good and I need it. I probably had to turn down 10 drinks yesterday. Watching people get sloppier throughout the night didn't make drinking any more appealing... besides I was mainly a solo drinker anyway...I don't have much of a point I guess I'm just posting to get my thoughts on paper. I need to keep fighting. It's important to revisit my main reasons to quit ( I was a miserable son of a bitch that wanted to kill myself). I want to find out who my true self is... I have never been sober for any of my 20 years of adulthood. ..IWNDWYT

Congrats on nearly 100 days!..I'm not an AA-goer myself but I found it helpful to keep doing things that supported my recovery in other ways.....This could include listening to podcasts like 'Recovery Elevator' listening to AA speaker recordings on YouTube (Anthony Hopkins' and Craig Ferguson's shares are very funny!) reading some '[Quit Lit](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/books) watching talks on the neuroscience of addiction on YouTube (Gabor Mate Ruth Potee Kevin McCauley Dr Robert LeFever) etc etc.....Plus regular participation here on r/stopdrinking of course!..Kudos for turning down the drinks while you're gigging... Don't forget that lots of famous musicians used to have drink and/or drug problems and then got sober so you're just following in the footsteps of Tom Waits Eric Clapton David Bowie etc etc.....Keep up the good work!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
