I fantasized about it that day/night when alcohol would be ok again and all the fun party times would just roll in unencumbered like logs falling off a truck...This was not the case. Probably ruined things with a recently single (and very desirable) woman I like and had to call out of work which I haven't done in the past decade. ..Luckily I don't hate myself too much but I'm finding it hard to understand how this hangover was an acceptable daily condition.

Ok dust yourself off and get back to work on fixing yourself...For me recovery is much more than stopping drink/drugs though that is the first stage.   Sooner or later I had to work on those things that " made me drink".   My route was through AA there are other paths...    ..Once those were taken care of to some extent I found I could have fun without drink.
The idea that somehow someday he/she will control and enjoy his/her drinking is the great obsession of every abnormal drinker. The persistence of this illusion is astonishing. Many pursue it to the gates of insanity or death" [Big book chap 3 para 1](http://www.aa.org/bigbookonline/en_bigbook_chapt3.pdf)
Well... hopefully you learned something and can move on.  Good luck.
Relapse doesn't officially occur until a solid period of recovery has been established. It also starts before we pick up the drink. The only good thing about it is the opportunity to learn about ourselves and to understand and accept the power of alcohol. ..* I fantasized about it that day/night when alcohol would be ok again and all the fun party times would just roll in unencumbered like logs falling off a truck...An answer is in this statement. Writing out a detailed first step goes a long way in reducing such thinking. .
