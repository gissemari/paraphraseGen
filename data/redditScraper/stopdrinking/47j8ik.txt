..Imagine you're a boy nine ten I remember (or maybe imagine) being eleven...Imagine your life Is fairly normal for a boy that age.  You enjoy normal kid things. Life is good. ..Your dad works hard mom works... two young brothers who look up to you.  Your dad drinks nightly and tokes secretly but at this point none of that concerns you.  All appears good...Imagine enjoying camping trips with your father where you explore your young and curious love and fascination of nature.   ..Imagine being an age where you're just about to start considering what it means to be a boy...  what It means to grow into a good and right man.  ..Now... imagine... put those shoes on because we're going for a walk...Only this walk isn't quite aimless...Imagine your mother telling you that your father after nine years of seeing him as one is not really your father at all... ..Imagine your surprise when you realize that the very foundation of the first nine years of your life your family unit has been built on lies.  Imagine the feelings of confusion and distrust crashing hard into your nine year old body...Imagine being that same boy just a child and unable to even recognize the intense feeling of betrayal that has be turned on high.  All in time to begin considering "manhood."..Fast foward a few years.  A nasty divorce between mom and "dad" results in homelessness and drug addiction on one parents end debt and a string of shitty relationships on the other's.  But by this time distrust and resentment has brought you a certain numbness toward your family creating distance between your siblings even...Now you're a young man who in a sense lost not one but two fathers in a time when a solid perspective of men and a good idea of what "being a man" means is probably critical for a young developing boy.  ..Are you at all surprised that you struggle with understanding a sense of self over the next few years?.Are you at all surprised that you struggle with the meaning of "Truth?"  Is it surprising that you have trouble taking anything at face value accepting things as they appear to be?  .Are you surprised that alcohol has begun to become a source of relief of feelings that you haven't even identified?...Imagine beginning to realize that your drinking might be problematic.  A DUI resulting in two totalled cars felony charges lost jobs and friendships public intox and drunk and disorderly charges...how many times?  ..What are you to do when you try and confront a problem that you don't know the source of?  Isolate...that's what I did..Called up "dad" and moved two states away thinking "good I can get to know my dad and get my life together."..All is great for a bit though living with parents after years out is tough.  "Dad" tries to make up for not being there but the feeling that it's too late for that is ever present.  Dad drinks about a half to  two-thirds a 1/5th a night and I just moved to an area known for legal weed and a growing craft beer scene.  As a result it's not as quick and easy "getting my life together" as I thought.  ..Imagine having a mirror... that instead of showing you as you currently appear shows you what you will become shows you what you hide from yourself and the world...I'm about a year sober and in order to do that I've had to minimize contact with a man who has probably viewed the past few years as a chance to make up for his past to build a relationship with his only child.  ..On one hand I want to walk away and have nothing to do with him on the other....i know the struggle of control over alcohol and the pain felt as others walk away because of your choice to consume.  ..This isn't quite the one year reflection post I had in mind but it's a bit of an exploration of the roots of my suffering and a bit of a rough draft of my story...It's not all here but perhaps I'll write it all out someday.  It's challenging to write on a phone.  ..Have a good day.  Remember to smile and breathe and be present.  :).....
