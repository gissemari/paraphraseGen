Just got back from a relapse prevention retreat at Hazelden. I learned about making better habits and about what happens once you get sober.. you grow physically and intellectually and then when you relapse again you don't give yourself the chance to grow spiritually or emotionally. I never gave myself a chance. I have 4 months sober. My girlfriend is out of town and I'll just be working. I will not drink with you today.
