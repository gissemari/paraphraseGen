Hello everyone. A little over a month ago for an unknown reason a switch flicked in my head. I recently turned 30 I was coming out of a two night bender and my body & mind were feeling very very bad...I've been drinking for 12 years now. I've wandered the streets of Moscow in winter in a total black-out state I woke up on a hotel roof in Mexico; I've been to jail twice in my home country for being totally fcked up and dozens more of the usual sad stories that I often read around here. For some reason I've never done drugs and never ever ever got behind the wheel drunk and never got in a fight so there's that. I always think that I've been so lucky that nothing bad has ever happened when so much *could* have happened. I remember getting massively hammered at a sailing event and waking up back on our boat that was berthed far away from the wharf along 10 other boats: one wrong step I would have been in the water and probably not here to write this...My alcoholism has been on and off. Sometimes I'd be sober for a couple of months a few weeks and then binge like crazy. I'm an addict all around so food work sports sex porn... I try to manage everything but I'm walking a fine line; alcohol wasn't really something I've ever tried to manage...I started smoking cigarettes in high school when I was around 16 or 17 and I remember quitting cold turkey when I was 22. No other reason than I woke up and looked at myself in the mirror and thought "Be reasonable cigarettes are bad for you stop now." And I did. I have this mental strength sometimes I don't really know where it comes from but I'm glad I have it. I've been doing triathlon now for seven years although I train hard - that never stopped me from drinking. I remember trying to not drink three months before a race and then finding myself drinking a six pack and then trying not to drink two months before and then all I could do was not have any alcohol the week of the race...As I get older my hangovers are getting worse. Now after a massive night of drinking I need three four days to recover. I think it also has to do with my level of fitness - the fitter I get the less my body understands what's happening when I down 4 or 5L of beer and a few shots of tequila. I also occasionally smoke a cigarette when I'm drunk and that makes it so much worse...I have tried with success so far to moderate. I limit myself to one glass of wine or one glass of beer per week; so far it's going okay. I have cravings however. I really really want sometimes to have two three four beer. But I know exactly what will happen if I break that "one glass" limit. That doesn't mean I WILL have my one glass a week - It's just a limit I have set to be able to enjoy a good wine or a good beer with the right people at the right time. I'm only 33 days in - now I'm aiming for my second month. In my mind I realize that I haven't been sober for six months since I'm 18 and I think that is kind of sad. I think that with discipline I can do this; if I feel that I cannot I will have to not drink at all I know I can do it. I'm scared to relapse but I will fight with everything I have in me so that it doesn't happen...One of my closest friend committed suicide a year ago. He drank lots. He was the best person I knew. He once came home to find me half asleep on the living room floor after I had a whole bottle of bourbon at 5pm and took me to have some food. It feels good to write that down because looking back that was pathetic. I miss him and I will never exactly know why he put an end to his life but I ~~suspect~~ know alcohol had something to do with it...Thanks for listening I wasn't really going to write all that down but it just came out. I'm an alcoholic and an addict. And a lurker and I have found a lot of help reading stories around here - alcohol is not the problem I am my problem. But I'm working on it one day one week at a time.

Welcome to being an active member of the sub. ..I'm glad moderation is working for you. I'm guessing that since you've been lurking here you've read that many folks have not been as successful so I won't repeat my own cautionary tale. If it works for you -- then that is all that matters...I imagine your triathlons and the training will markedly improve the longer drinking is drastically limited. My improved running/training is one the main motivators for me staying sober. Like you there were no major events before I stopped drinking. I just realized that when I couldn't go three days without alcohol that I had a problem. It took me awhile to do something about it... ..I raise my coffee in a toast to a sober day - cheers
I feel like getting it out on internet paper even to anonymous strangers can help you really find yourself. Thinking about your feelings is easy sometimes talking to yourself about them.. But writing it down and then posting it on the internet? That makes it seem so real. Good post man you are not pathetic.
