Hey you came back! That's the good news. I screwed up after 9 months sober and then said "screw it" and went on a YEAR LONG bender. Be glad you came right back! Congrats on day 1. It really is huge even if it doesn't feel like it. 
Luckily you didn't hurt yourself or anyone else. You can come back from this. ..When you were trying to be sober were you working any sort of program to help? For me **just** trying to not use has never worked. I now go to meetings surround myself with sober friends and pray daily. It is much easier for me this way.
