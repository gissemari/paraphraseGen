OP deleted his/her account before I could finish my response to [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/261764/not_sure_if_i_have_a_problem/) so I'll post it here in hopes that he/she is lurking and it helps:..In my experience of my many addictions: weed prescription drugs ecstasy cocaine and alcohol **the only one that can be completely certain that you have a problem is you.** .	.People can try to tell you you have (or don't have) a problem but if you don't believe it you'll just ignore their point of view. Everyone told me I had a problem when I was doing hard illegal drugs; but they didn't want to make the effort to help and I eventually recognized my problems and helped myself. ..No one has **ever** told me I have a problem with alcohol whether it be because it's "socially acceptable" or it just has not ruined relationships to the extent my other addictions have; I cannot say. Perhaps because I was still "functional" yet after all my other addictions alcohol is the only substance I cannot control myself with and constantly relapse with. So I know; not matter what that little voice in my head says and tries to lie to me about:..* *It's okay just one drink man.*.* *You DESERVE it it's been a rough day.*.* *You worked hard a man is entitled to come home and drink a beer after a hard days work*..**I AM POWERLESS OVER ALCOHOL.**..**TLDR**: The only one that can be completely certain that you have a problem is you.

&gt;No one has **ever** told me I have a problem with alcohol..Ditto; it was a bit of a shock when I quit. I knew and that was enough.
Good work /u/newspeakers .  OP and I spoke in PM and I'm optimistic that he will re-join us as he goes along.  
I suspect though that if you suspect that you have a problem you probably do.
I always knew I drank too much but didn't think I was an alcoholic. My friends and I used to have drunken debates about this. We always concluded that we were okay for now...I recognized the powerlessness after I joined AA. I realized I couldn't accurately predict what would happen after I took that first drink. Many times I would set out to only have a few drinks but by the end of the night I was shit faced. Or how I knew driving home drunk was dangerous but after a few drinks I didn't give a shit. When I started recognizing all those negative behaviors I knew I was powerless over alcohol.
On the other side of it...if you DO think that you have have a problem don't let people try to tell you otherwise. ..Whenever I tried to tell my friends in college that I thought I had a problem they would say "Oh I'm sure you're fine. Why don't you just try to drink less?"..WOW WHAT A GREAT IDEA! DRINK LESS? I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. I hate when people say that. If you are questioning always try to talk to people who are in AA (or other support groups) and have a better chance of understanding what you are going through. 
I think one of the most basic truths is that if alcohol has caused you problems you can't live with it's a problem. I think a lot of people have the idea that an alcoholic has to look or act a certain way. Believe me i have looked at still suffering alcoholics and they looked fine on the outside. Good job look great nice car nice house or apartment...i was that way for a while. The problems caused by active alcoholism don't always manifest on the outside...What many people don't understand is that you can control your drinking and just drink on weekends and still be an alcoholic. Where it becomes a problem is when you can't both control and enjoy your drinking. The normies i encounter don't seem to feel like drinking more than a few drinks. They don't have to limit their drinking they just stop. They don't feel like they've been shortchanged if they quit drinking because if they drink more they will be overindulging. This way of thinking was totally foreign to me. I had to ask a normie about why they didn't drink more when they could. For me if i had a day off i drank with complete abandon the night before. I mean isn't that what you're supposed to do? I felt like i was conditioned to do this. I wasted many an off day on a hangover...I think a lot of people get hung up on the question ''am i an alcoholic?" when they should be asking themselves "do i have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol?"
