Feels good :)..Struggle: Looking at making changes in my life to become more balanced not easy but should be worth it...General chat: I tweaked my back some weird way earlier this week it's really annoying and painful...Have a great 24 hours folks!
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph: celebrated 10months props to the artists offtherocks and rogermelly1 you guys made my fricken day!!..Struggle: financial reparation - ick but better out then in and will be back to zero after the next pay cycle. Trying not to freak about the budgeting. Money fretting it turns out is somewhat triggerish. But not today :)...General chat: driving man crazy times. On freeways and everything. Just like a real grown up.  
Triumph: I started doing recovery readings and reconnecting with my higher power/spirituality. Realized I was far gone from my program and recommitted to myself...Struggle: Making ends meet is tough. Especially when your ends include a wedding...General chat: My rabbit Billy Pancakes is getting neutered today. I hope he stops humping everything.
Triumph: After taking a week off of working out for a shoulder injury I'm now 100 percent and will be beginning again tonight...Struggle: My 6 month relationship is on the rocks and due to her dishonesty about a bunch of small things and the failure to come clean about any of them I'm going to let her go this weekend. ..General chat: It's time to find a support group in my new area kind of excited to get back into the 12-step scene (Haven't been to a meeting besides the online ones I hold in 6 months)...Congrats on the year brother. I raise my Shirley Temple to you.
Triumph: I finally beat Dark Souls... oh and did well in a job interview. :)..Struggle: I'm an atheist but I've decided to partake in Ramadan this year. The lack of water is going to take some getting used to in this summer heat. Everyone is having BBQ's too...General chat: Who even invented sunburn? Curse them.
Triumph: almost to a month of no drinking after going to booze riddled festival and getting offered a drink every few hours or so.  and i did this with very little anxiety...Struggle: The next step.  I feel like that's great that I quit drinking but now what? Where do I go from here?..General chat: Trying to get ready for Burning Man which is always a huge production and financially draining but my excitement is growing every day.
Triumph: Another week  .Struggle: Lot's of anxiety the past couple of weeks over a girl. Chest tightness and insomnia but she wants to stay friends only. New trigger identified. I want to drink to sleep and stop thinking to turn off the brain.  .General Chat: I need to get outside and talk to other people. Work folk are cool but need to get away.
Triumph:  Our A/C broke Monday night so we were without air conditioning all day yesterday and last night.  We live in Dallas and our living room reached temperatures around 95 degrees.  My roommate who doesn't know I've taken a vow of sobriety made me a daiquiri along with himself.  I without any anxiety or any stress told him thanks but I couldn't drink it and handed it back to him.  After nearly 80 days things do get easier...Struggle:  God damn it's fuckin' hot in here.
Grats on the year! I am getting inordinately excited about coming up on 6 months like waiting for Christmas; I'll probably wet myself at a year. So I can imagine. ..Triumph: Yesterday ran 15 miles in the mid-day heat carried no water like a fool. Drank a gallon+ before I could pee again. Did not want a beer or even think of it when I followed with a late lunch at a country pub. ..Struggle: Same old nemme mind Huck...Chat: Shit doesn't bother me like it used. I don't dislike shit less it's just that in the big picture most shit is little shit. Friends dying is big. If I'm gonna be dead in 30+ years (with luck) let the good times roll now. Correction make the good times roll the little shit right out of the way. 
Triumph: Finally starting to feel like a human being again (anxiety/head-fog clearing up a bit). Got over my fear of applying for jobs and am already seeing great opportunities. Launched a great new product at work that I'm super excited about and is getting positive reviews. Gone "out" twice with friends and had no desire to drink even when they were...Struggle: Still not feeling 100%. Need to work on patience and being kind to myself. Still feeling super fatigued 24/7 trying to figure out why...General chat: I am wearing a kitty sweatshirt and I'm very happy about it.
Yay Wednesday!..**triumph** Went out to dinner last night and can honestly say I don't even know if the place sells liquor. Didn't even consider looking for it.  The only reason I realized it was when I was emailing with some on later on that night about my day...**struggle** work has been crazy busy and coworkers aren't being very considerate to one another leading to in fighting. I hate moderating that crap...**general chat** The shift key on my keyboard keeps sticking so I have to keep banging it to prevent yelling at people over email. Probably wouldn't help that struggle thing I've got going on if I miss it. 
Triumph - I had been really miserable at my job. Quit yesterday and am starting with a new firm tomorrow. Also started driving for one of the ride sharing services to make some extra $$$. Never could have done either drinking..Struggle: With change comes some anxiety. Drinking was the easiest way to beat that...Time to deal with it all head on. Also need air conditioning in my apartment. It's getting fucking hot..General: The Dodgers are gaining on 1st place :) I actually am enjoying games more with no beer.
Triumph: YAY. Crappy things can happen and I don't immediately crave all the alcohol...Struggle: Crappy things happen. Crappy couple of weeks punctuated by short moments of awesomeness...General chat: Going to climb a mountain (like a real big one) and sleep next to a glacier in two weeks. Excited Scared. 
I'm two days late but what can you do.....**Triumph**: Things are going well.  The idea of drinking just isn't part of my world anymore.  I went through July 4th without even having the though enter my head even though there was someone drinking at my house while we were grilling.  It has just become something I don't do.  I also don't steal cars (I tried to find some obscure example that I wouldn't some day end up doing)...**Struggle**: Still dealing with relationship things... open communication is difficult but it definitely is the answer...**General Chat**: I've stopped *trying* to lose weight and am still losing about a pound a week.  I'm down to 205 (from 288 a year ago).  Go me!
