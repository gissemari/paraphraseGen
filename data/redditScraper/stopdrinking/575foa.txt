since my last relapae had my drinking while caring for my toddler i need tonput together a plan i can write down to ensure his safety while with me. my wife works 2 or 3 days a week and i am usually responsible to watch him for a few hours at least kn thoae days. i have thought to call and check in with family and friends midway through so they can validate my sobriety that day. also have an escape plan for my son in calling in family in the event i relapse again very painful to write in ink. can anyone share ideas or experience? very grateful for this chance i have and certainly not drinking today.

Is this something you are putting together at someone else's request? If it's something you are putting together it sounds to me like you don't trust yourself fully yet. In which case no harm in passing off care of the child to a trusted someone (family sitter etc.) with or without you there until you get some more sober time under your belt and trust yourself more.
