Hello wonderful people..I'm a little over one month sober the longest I've gone in over 10 years since I was 18 years old. I thought I'd do a little recap of the changes I've experienced over the last 30+ days mostly as a fun reminder of where I've come from when I look back but if it helps someone starting out that's great too...*Edit: This got way long. Read at risk to your own boredom*..**The Physical (or: Dear God Why Am I So Fucking Tired)**..I underestimated the physical toll that sobriety would take on my body at first and I'm really not sure why. I was a nighttime drinker (1-2 bottles of wine starting at 5pm daily) and a weekend binger but for some reason I thought that I wasn't "physically" addicted. I never experienced shakes hallucinations or any of the really serious or life-threatening withdrawal symptoms. ..What I got was seriously slapped in the face with fatigue. Like bone-deep agonizing fatigue. It started about 3 days after my last drink. I would wake up happy enough to not be sweating/puking/trying to remember what happened the night before but still tired. I felt like I always always needed more sleep. ..2-4pm were the absolute worst times. I would slump over my desk at work and lay my head on my hands. I actually dozed off sitting up something I thought was impossible. My workouts actually suffered during this period. Even with all my drinking I would make it to yoga 3-4x a week but I could barely bring myself to go to 1-2 easy classes...This didn't stop abruptly - I gradually got more energy and about a week ago I realized that I felt more or less normal. So it DOES end. I haven't experienced MORE energy than my pre-sober levels but I'm at least about leveled off. Hopefully there's more improvement to come here...A few other weird things that happened: I have an autoimmune condition and it flared up a few weeks after I stopped drinking. Maybe due to the stress of the change on my body? No idea but that's under control now. Random sweet cravings have started (I never ate sugar before) usually around the time I would have had drinks. Oh and my face broke out. My skin is about middle-school quality right now. Yikes...**The Mental**..So maybe this hasn't really made me feel amazing on the physical side yet but my thinking is WAY clearer which is weird considering how tired I've been. In the hours when I'm not fatigued I have a much easier time writing and being productive at work. Mentally demanding tasks take about half the time. I've accomplished a few things at work that have been in progress for ages now. Apparently all I needed was a few not-hungover days to get that shit knocked out...Seriously I'd recommend sobriety to anyone just for the sake of being able to think again. Using my brain doesn't feel like a slow agonizing slog. But unfortunately there's an ugly side to this. I find myself remembering everything - especially shit I used to drink to forget...**Remembering dumb drunken behavior strikes at random and it sucks**..Living in a gross-feeling hungover daze apparently kept these nasty memories suppressed. Sort of like how steroids suppress the symptoms of an inflammatory disease. The problem is still there and will flare up as soon as the suppressing agent is removed...I think about my dumb drunk behavior a *lot*. I don't try to do this. I'll be thinking about something else and the memory springs on me out of nowhere. Not just recent events either - things I did when I was 18 will return to haunt me. I'm hoping that I eventually find some peace with this once the feelings that go with the memories have had time to process...**Wasted time is the worst regret**..This one is personal but I imagine some of you can relate. There was a 2-3 year period in which I was stuck in an ugly soul-killing relationship where my alcoholism turned into a serious problem. I would stay up until 4am every single night drinking 2-3 bottles of wine playing video games and getting blackout just so I wouldn't have to share a bed with my ex. My job allowed me to work late hours so I would wake up at noon and drag ass into the office around 2pm only to do shitty work and mostly browse reddit until it was time to repeat the night's abuse. I would tell myself that I would be productive this weekend or tomorrow and then go drink more to kill my guilt...Thinking back to those years is infinitely more painful than remembering the random stupid drunken hookups I had. I'm really amazed at how well I suppressed my guilt and shame over this time with alcohol. Now sober I think back and wonder where my life would be had I dumped the deadbeat and stopped drinking 3 years ago...Those regrets are my biggest struggle now. I feel like I'm trying to make up for lost time...**My Friends Don't Get It**..I've only "come out" to my husband about my drinking problem. This was pretty easy - he took care of my during the worst of my blackout days and he expressed concern about me hurting myself a few times. He doesn't drink either so I've been lucky to have the constant support from him without worrying about alcohol in the house. It makes things easier...My friends are another matter completely. I've taken a different approach with each of them sort of as an experiment. Here's what I did:..* Sarah best friend and moderate drinker with the occasional binge: "I'm not drinking anymore because it doesn't mix well with my medication and I'm trying to get healthy.".* Sam mutual friend of me & husband very occasional drinker: "After getting so wasted at that wedding I really haven't had the urge to drink again so I stopped.".* Lisa & Anne new moms with babies and moderate/heavy drinkers: "I just don't feel like it".* All other friends in my life aren't close enough to me to get an explanation. My family never knew how much I drank so I've decided to keep silent on this when I'm with them for now...Sam seems to "get it" the most. He's been present for some of my dumbest most cripplingly embarassing moments so I'm sure he understands that I can't control myself. He only asked once "Are you still not drinking?" That's all the questioning I've gotten from him...Lisa & Anne think I'm trying to get pregnant. I've told them this isn't the case but they're going to think what they want. I don't feel comfortable telling them the truth because they gossip and can be very judgemental. I DO like hanging out with them because they're the few friends I have whose idea of a fun night is standing in a smoky bar...Sarah: This is the hardest one. We're longtime best friends and drinking buddies. She's getting married soon so she's going to have bachelorette/wedding drunkfests coming up. She runs with a VERY heavily drinking crowd. I'm talking people who violently shake until they have their morning beer. Social outings with this group of people have provoked questions so I've been "fake drinking" around them by ordering a club soda with lime and just not saying anything about it...I think I'm going to have to come clean with her - a few days ago she asked if I'd lost any weight from not drinking. When I said no she laughed and told me that I should just start again. She also keeps hinting around at drinking during the wedding festivities and I don't want to bust her bubble by telling her I've quit...Really its my fault that they don't "get it" because I haven't come clean about my reasons for getting sober. I'm just not ready to have those conversations yet. However I'm committed to this completely so if the situation arises where they continue to pressure and question me I'm probably going to have to speak up...If you made it through this whole thing thanks for reading! If not at least I can look back to this post at 60 days 90 days etc etc to see how far I've come.
----------immediate responses--------

It gets easier...Physically: Things change. Your body is just trying to adjust. It took me about 3 months to get my sleep right...Mentally: I always had an awful memory until I stopped drinking. It's crazy how productive we can be at full attention!..Drunk Behavior/Regrets: I had a super hard time with these. I had to learn how to forgive myself the same way I would forgive others who had done me wrong. It took a while but one of the things that helped me alot was the realization that at the time I usually didn't know any better and that I can't regret the actions/decisions i've made in the past because without them I think I would still be drinking and I wouldn't have the amazing life I have today...Friends: It gets MUCH easier. The longer you stay sober the more they get it. My friends took a while to understand but once they realized it wasn't just a phase they got on board and have been a huge support system for me. Today I have no problem with telling someone I don't drink/I'm in recovery but thats only after 6+ Months of talking about it at meetings trying to figure out why I didn't want to. Spoiler alert: Pride/Ego/Fear...Congratulations on 30 days. Thats an amazing acheivement. Can't wait to see how you feel at 60!!
Thank you for sharing this. I marvel at all those who rave about great they feel. My skin is broken out worse than when I was a teenager. I'm exhausted. My mood flips between cheerful and irritable.  But I'm sober damn it. Now where am I getting my next ice cream?
The mental and physical part of your post was like reading into a mirror of my own persona experience for my first month. I was a "functional alcoholic" but drinking most every night half a liter of vodka on days off much more! I never was late to work but always had a debilitating hangover half my day. I was diffidently dependent. Yikes!! After my first month which fell like an eternity I felt ok. The second month really flew by and at the I can honestly say I felt grate. I am happy to break the cycle but I will only worrie about today!! .All the best to you! 
hi i enjoyed your post! happy for you about your month! great job! and man oh man do i relate to the tired thing! wow i mean my whole body is just tired in to the bone i must drag myself around feeling like an overboiled spaghetti. i'm glad to hear you got some relief from that makes me hopeful that will happen to me too sooner or later haha. good luck with your friends!
Thank you so much for this. I'm having a bad "my friends don't get it day" and reading your post makes me feel less alone. Congrats on 34 days. I won't drink with you today! :-) 
Great post! Congrats on a month and keep up the awesome work :)
Thank you for sharing this because I've really been struggling with the random dumb drunken behavior thoughts :( I'm glad I'm not the only one.. and my anxiety has been terrible today because of these memories just popping in my head for no reason. It's only day 5 for me so I'm hoping this will slowly get better.
