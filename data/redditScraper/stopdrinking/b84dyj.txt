I believe this is the longest I've gone without drinking since I started drinking in my early 20s. I was a regular drinker rather than a binge drinker but for a while there I was at around three drinks an evening sometimes more when I got home every single day and wow did it start to drag on me. I was almost always tired anxious irritable and depressed. I've had extra weight around my middle and rear almost this whole time. I would struggle with insomnia. But it felt like my whole social life was predicated on grabbing drinks. I LIKED chatting and socializing with friends during happy hour; would I have to give that up? I'm still wondering what will take its place for my social life. BUT..This has been easier than I expected. But only I think because I'd been inching toward this decision bit by bit reading more about the horrible health effects of alcohol already having cut back already having gone three days without drinking having a few sober friends to chat with. I also get really nerdy about anything that catches my interest so I devoured reading/listening to This Naked Mind now reading Alcohol Explained have been watching Craig Beck videos on YouTube... Their approach (it seems there's a common approach among them) has been really effective for me. It's not a matter of having to deny yourself this wonderful thing but bit by bit seeing that this "wonderful" thing is not wonderful at all bit by bit realizing all the reasons you wanted it don't hold up to scrutiny. It becomes a LOT less appealing pretty quickly at least for me...The acute edginess and anxiety a few days in were real. I'm still a bit foggy-headed and I feel like my sleep hasn't totally repaired but it's better. I still have a bit of general anxiety and irritability but I'm sticking it out. While learning so much about alcohol has convinced me I don't want it in my system what's positively MOTIVATING me is excitement over who I'm going to be without it. It's like "one weird trick" to get a bunch of your life back to snap back to being fully alive. I want to shout this from rooftops but I'll try to stay humble and not lecture friends who drink. Still ... what an amazing thing to discover: our own lives again our own health our own energy and our own possibility. That to me is so amazing.

Congratulations! Those books are great. Society markets booze as the most wonderful thing in the world and it is everywhere and part of almost everything we do  which makes it hard to swim against the tide. IWNDWYT 
Hey this post - especially the last part - was really helpful for me today! Just not picking up that drink is kindof a silver bullet for a lot of things isn't it? Yay! IWNDWYT
