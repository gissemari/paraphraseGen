Countless relapses. I will gain momentum then tell myself that one night of drinking won't hurt. What a fucking lie. I've ruined relationship after relationship. I've lied to cover up my shame. I feel bloated and miserable. I've got a lot of rebuilding to do. But I am up to the task. I know life is better in sobriety. I feel more alive and full of energy when I'm not drinking. I feel lethargic and sick when I am. Enough is enough. Fuck you alcohol. You are my demon. You are my enemy.

Right there with you today. Made an ass of myself in front of a girl I just met this weekend. Hopefully she was being honest when she said it wasn't a big deal. Today has been hell. 
Us one dayers gotta show some serious love. We are all in the same boat feeling like crap. *HUG*.But you know what? We are here we are making the first step even if it's the first step for the hundredth time. Lets remember how terrible day one feels and use that as inspiration to keep going &lt;3
