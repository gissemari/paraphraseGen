Day 77 and my first sober bachelorette party is in the books. Overall it was good I managed to stay out with the yougins dancing until 2:00 AM without any alcohol. I still enjoy dancing and people-watching without drinking which is a relief. My tolerance for people's drunk/hungover selves was pretty good but I'm totally exhausted now and need to decompress a bit. I ended up getting an earlier flight out today so that I could just get a little solo quiet time this weekend...I'm super tired now but it's nice that I'm only sleep deprived and not hungover. I was able to get myself up and ready in plenty of time this morning and able to help get the house in order for checkout so the other gals on the struggle-bus could take it a little slower today. It made me feel good to be the helpful one for once and not the one dragging ass and feeling like death. ..I also feel proud of myself that I made it through a weekend with a bunch of new people sober. The bride my future sister-in-law told me what a blast I am (we hadn't ever partied together prior to this) - so I guess I'm still fun sans-booze (honestly a big anxiety for me)!..Anyway sorry for the ramble - feeling a bit punchy with my 4 hours of sleep :) ..IWNDWYT!

That's awesome! I also worry about being boring if I'm not drinking but I'm starting to realize that I'm not any more funny or entertaining when I'm drunk just obnoxious (I have a friend that's very active on Snapchat). ..Congratulations on your achievement! Not drinking with you today 
I'm totally impressed and proud of you! IWNDWYT!
