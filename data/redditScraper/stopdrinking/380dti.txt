Hi all. This is my very first Reddit post...I have been struggling with alcohol since I turned 21 (now I am 27) & am a binge drinker. I drink once every so often (1 time a month at most) but I get so blacked out & belligerent it has caused so much chaos in my life. I come from a long line of binge drinkers (including my parents) but my Mom makes it seem like I am a murderer instead of an alcoholic... I think I finally hit rock bottom. I was at a family friend's wedding last night & got so drunk fell down multiple times lied about being drunk yelled at my Mom in front of her friends called my boyfriend 36 times (why? I have NO idea) & broke a lamp....And I literally dont remember ANY of it. I was "there" 1 minute & totally blackout the next..Thankfully I was driven home safe but feel like the worst person in the world. I am used to apologizing for drunk behavior but I think this is the worst. My boyfriend is super supportive patient & understanding thank God...I've tried AA in the past but did not enjoy the "cult" feeling of it (apologies if I offended anyone) & did not enjoy being harassed on a daily basis by a complete stranger about going to meetings. It just wasn't the right fit for me...Any suggestions on how to recover or get help besides AA?..Thank you in advance this is a great & supportive group!

Inpatient helped me. Addiction counselor in there kicked my ego into next century. It worked.
At the time I quit I would have blown a homeless guy if I thought it would help.  The statements you're making are not consistent with someone at "rock bottom." It gets way way worse.  It's said that people don't quit until the pain of continuing to use outweighs the pain of quitting. Unfortunately most addicts have a pretty high tolerance for pain.  ..Imagine that the year is 2022. You're begging and pleading to a god you're not sure exists for just one more chance. *Please I'll do anything just let me do it all over again. One more chance. That's all I ask. I'll do it right this time I swear.*  ..POOF!  Wish granted.  ..Welcome (back) to 2015 the day after that wedding.  Here's your chance to do it all again. Just like you asked for. You won't get another. Make the most of it.
