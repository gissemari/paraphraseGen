Thanks for coming back and having the courage to tell on yourself.
It's a learning experience that you can turn into a positive. What did you learn about yourself?
Try to learn from it without dwelling on it. Never give up on trying. You got this. I'm sorry that all I can offer is platitudes. But you're here now and it's never too late to try again. What can you do differently? 
And you got up again. That s what matters. Keep fighting keep trying it will get better. You will make it.
Stick around. It gets better.
Hey it's OK. 3 or 4 days was my 'magic' number for months! It took a while for it to stick. After each try I changed up my routine kept looking at new strategies journaled about what happened... and eventually it stuck.
That first week is no joke. The next few months weren't much easier for me. ..Early sobriety will be difficult and uncomfortable but it is temporary. A saying that really helped me is: **if you're walking through Hell *keep walking***. That's the only way to get to the other side. I know... it fucking sucks but being stuck in the cycle of active addiction ain't any better. It was like trading one Hell for another except the Hell of early sobriety turned into a sense of peace after some time for me. ..You can do it! It just takes some practice. Try again! I won't drink with you. 
It took me many tries to get past 4 days. .Keep trying. I will not drink with you today!
