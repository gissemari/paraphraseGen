I am doing it again. I went to rehab in January and made it to 90 days and relapsed. I've been trying to quit and 10 days is the furthest I've gone since then. I am so scared of failing again. I messed up really bad a few times this last month and I really want to be happy and healthy. I don't really feel like I deserve much happiness after all the shit I've put my support system through. I'm kind of rambling. I just really want to drink right now but the day is almost over and I know I can power through. Maybe I'll go get some cake or something.

The evening hours are always bad for me also. My thoughts are with you. A cake sounds great I had lots of ice-cream yesterday night. IWNDWYT
When I struggle I get some dove dark chocolate.   I go in my back yard in my zero g chair mediate for 5 minutes and throw a square in my mouth and soak in the flavor.  Sounds  stupid but it releases  dopamine as the same as alcohol.  
You do deserve happiness.  You are trying to make things better and fighting the same disease everyone else here is.  I know it is not easy and one day at a time is how I made my life better. Congratulations to you on 10 day! You can do this! IWNDWYT 
You can do this I'm pulling for you. ...... I just had a 3:00 am breakfast.. eggs perogies potatoes..I can hear coyotes serenading me and my dogs. Iwndwyt.
