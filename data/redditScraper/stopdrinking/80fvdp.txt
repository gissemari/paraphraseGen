Currently nursing the hangover of the century while at work. My aunt passed away a few days ago so I was with family for the last few days and started right back up with the binge drinking...Today really sucks. I'm disappointed in myself and feel my core at about 5% battery life. But at least I know what I'm capable of and that being sober really is a great feeling. So I'm going to try again. Please wish me luck...EDIT: some context. I made it over a month without a drop before my most recent relapse. it's easily the longest streak of sobriety I've had in years and owe much of it to this sub.

So sorry for your loss. I'm glad you're back here at SD...No one can take your previous sober days from you they are still yours to take pride in...I will not drink with you today. 
Best of luck to you. 
For me grief management has been one of the most challenging aspects of sobriety. I believe you can stay positive and stay sober. IWNDWYT
