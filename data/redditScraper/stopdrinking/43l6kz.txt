I'm in bed with a fever falling in and out of sleep. You guys know the feeling just physically exhausted body hurts you're shivering but your breath is so hot. Anyway I just woke up from my most intense relapse dream yet. I was not even dreaming that I drank but dreaming that I woke up in my bed severely hungover not knowing what I did the night before and my husband helping me put the pieces back together. Stuff that stood out was that 1) in the dream we were in some house and I got dream-blackout-drunk with not only my parents and sister but with my grandma who passed away last year and 2) in the dream my husband told me that he asked me if I really wanted to drink and that I hadn't looked as happy in days than when we drank together. I got real mad at him in the dream. ..Anyway I am pretty sure I was just shown a few things that subconsciously worry me (my family is German and whenever I go home to visit drinking is a huge part of what we do). I just wanted to share and get this icky sticky after-dream feeling off me. :) ..In reality this is my 11th day and I'm not thinking about relapsing any time soon / ever. I will not drink today.

You're still getting all the withdrawals on day 10??
I bet you're right about your subconscious. Drinking dreams happen for me they went away after a few years. 
I was shivering shaking fever and with headache starting Friday.  Yesterday I went to urgent care and learned I have the flu.  So it may not be withdrawal symptoms.
It is probably common to actually get the flu or a cold when you shock your body with no drinking.
