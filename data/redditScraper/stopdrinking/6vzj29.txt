I've been struggling for six months since my relapse (over 5 years sober.) I have only had a few bad days in the last 5 weeks or so but I haven't been able to stay sober for more than 2 weeks in that time period. I know how to do this. I just need to do it!..I haven't done any real damage since my relapse but it certainly is heading that way if i don't stay quit. I am becoming more aware of some lost respect at work. I was asking a simple question the other day and felt like I was a kid in preschool with the way she responded. ..I'm not expecting any response on this one I just needed to get my stress and frustration out into the world so I don't have to hold on to it. ..I'm happy to not drink with all of you today!

Good for you. You recognize the problem and you are doing something about it. The only thing that matters is today the hour the minute. The past is irrelevant it has no actual influence on your present decisions.  Also it's great that you caught it early and that the damage has been relatively minor. I will not drink with you today.
It's just a number. Like your weight. What's important is how your body and mind are feeling. How you're processing people's attitudes towards you including your own. Don't worry about how big the number gets only that it's &gt;0 and that you're content with your choices. Good for you to come back and I'm happy to see you here. Happy Friday and I will not drink with you today!
Good for you to come back.  I'm not following why the trouble at work.  Were you going in really hung over?  I won't drink with you today.
