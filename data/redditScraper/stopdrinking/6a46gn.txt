It's been a while for anyone who probably doesn't recognize me but may have seen me around. I relapsed at a point or two... I haven't been keeping track but I know my badge is a lie. I haven't gone wild or binged. I'm grateful for that. I did get a few sixers on various occasions though. I'm not proud of that; not particularly ashamed either make of that what you will...What I would encourage you to make of it is this: relapsing happens failures happen; but you're only as lost as you let yourself be. I indulged let go a few times but I grabbed back on. I'm drinking a lot of tea eating a lot of junk food redeveloped a caffeine dependency because it helps me feel energetic in spite of the migraines and their other friends... but I'm not drinking...You don't have to be in a bad place to decide to stop drinking. You don't have to be in a good place to keep it that way. If you're struggling remember that you deserve to do your damndest to be happy; if you're like me remember that drinking will not make you happy it will not make you dumb but it will make you numb. It is in my experience almost never worth doing.

Agreed! Well said.. I have fallen back into drinking here and there (more then I want) but I make sure I'm easy with myself about it.  Beating myself up is just gonna make things worse.. every time I slip I learn a lesson I learn more and more that I don't need/ want alcohol in my life.  
So well said.  Thank you for sharing this.  I appreciate the pure and beautiful honesty.
