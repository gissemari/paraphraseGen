Hey everyone I am doing ok.  Applying to jobs today and going to attend an A.A. meeting.  I've been asking myself why the hell did I decide to drink again.  I think its the people I associate with it's the pressure to drink with long time drinking buddies.  I think I will stay away from them when it comes to going out and drinking.  I can't maintain my ability to stop myself from ordering a beer when I go out.  I will make it. This will work.  Hopefully the new A.A. meeting today will help me out.  I've been going to another but I wasn't comfortable with that group so hopefully this will work out.  Thanks again for all your support.  Please God don't let me relapse again.

You can do this! I've been sticking to the *sober people sober places* rule and it's made a huge difference for me...I will not drink with you today!
