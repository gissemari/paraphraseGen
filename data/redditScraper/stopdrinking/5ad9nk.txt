I am two days out of detox and still suffering shakiness cramping muscle spasms crawling skin and tingling/numbness in my extremities.  The docs decided I wasn't in danger of dying anymore so they sent me home and now I am killing time just waiting for the evaluation that will determine if I am an "appropriate candidate" for inpatient treatment.  ..I am so scared that they will turn me down.  I don't think I can make this just doing intensive outpatient.  I have multiple trauma issues to deal with in addition to the alcohol addiction but my therapist won't work with me anymore until I kick the habit.  So a real Catch-22.  I feel like the daily multiple sessions that I got to participate in during detox were exactly what I needed.  Meetings 3-4 days a week just isn't going to cut it in my opinion...I have a recovered alcoholic friend I am keeping in touch with via Facebook and messages and a fellow detox patient who left the same day I did.  We are checking in with each other every day.  I am taking the Antabuse (which I like to refer to as "Barforal") and doing everything I can but I am so depressed and struggling to keep a positive outlook.  ..My husband is being super-supportive and is staying home with me until I can have my evaluation.  But everything just seems so bleak right now.

Hello. I empathize with you as your post reminds of the days when I felt exactly the same. It's normal to be depressed right now. It doesn't seem possible that you would be denied inpatient so I hope you hear good news soon. Rehab saved my life and started me on a lifetime of recovery. Hang on and stay in touch!
I went for 30 days of inpatient once. What followed was the most amazing rich and sober year of my life. Then I fucked up and went out again and it's been a struggle ever since wishing I could go back again. If you don't get into this one keep looking; you can and will find one if that's what you really need and want.
