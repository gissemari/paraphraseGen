Especially because I had been a morning drinker as of late and had been starting my day with a beer or glass of wine. So starting day 2 with other recovering alcoholics feels like a step in the right direction...I found out about an AA group in my area that meets at 6:30 every morning. Everyone was so nice and welcoming. A woman introduced herself to me and gave me a hug and she told me she's sponsoring other women. She helped me get a Big Book and we went to Starbucks after the meeting to read the beginning together. I feel... hopeful? Cautiously hopeful. Hopeful because of the support I received today cautious because I've relapsed several times before and I don't want to disappoint myself again...I have tried AA a handful of times before but never stuck with it. What changed this time? I think it's that I realized how powerless I am over my cravings. I lived in denial for a while thinking I could just stop whenever I wanted. Every case of alcohol was  just one more time before I quit.  I wish I could  just have a glass or two  like most people I know but that's just never how it plays out for me. ..This subreddit has been so helpful in helping me feel as though I can share my experience with people who understand. So thank you everyone for being so supportive. A lot of people in my personal life don't know about my relationship with alcohol...IWNDWYT
