So tuesday i fell off hard.  I want to say I relapsed then  but really looking back  I have been secretly drinking for a month or two. Tuesday was just the day it came crashing down. ..I have been waking up and leaving work early so I could drink before hand.  I would tell my girlfriend who is off work right now taking care of our son who is a month old today  that I was leaving work to hit mccdonalds before work.  Which I did.  I also hit the drive thru and bought 2 or sometimes 3 tall boys.  Id smash them all and go into work.  This lasted awhile.  I know i have a problem  but was kind of putting it in the back of my mind telling myself I had it under control.  Half the time I would get to work after drinking all that shit I would sneak out to the bar (work in a restaurant) and would pour a drink.  Sometimes sneaking back out and doing it again!  So than im in the back feeling fucking juiced and great.  What would i decide to do than?  Call the coke dealer. ..So now im multiple tall boys in  a few lines in  than the anxiety of all hell would start.  I would tell myself as long as I would stop by say 11 and get off at 5 i would be ok and my girlfriend wouldnt smell it on me.  Sometimes she probably did.  I dont know.  But this became my new routine  because I couldnt drink amy other times.  So this lasted about a month  maybe even longer. ..Well Tuesday is when i fucked it alllll up.  Routine started off the same as before.  Well I go to pick up a night shift after my morning.  I do this because I know ill get a break.  To drink even more and i wouldnt have to worry about getting smelled out because I wouldnt be smelling as bad.  Well I end up leaving at like 10:30 lying to my boss saying i had to run home real quick but really I went to pound 2 more tall boys in like 15 mins.  Now im 4 tall boys and a shot in and only been at work for like 2 hours.  Time to call for some cocaine. ..End up doing that than at this point cannot wait to go on break.  Go on break at about 130 and drink like 3 more talls and do the rest of the blow.  End up at back at 4. Now all i really remember is being in the office with one of my bosses after she called me out.  I remember her saying "i know you told me you used to have an alchoal problem. I have noticed you acting weird.  I told her shes right.  I have been fucking up.  I cant help it etc.  I.  A p. O. S. " she was even helping me do my stuff.  Being very kind and supportive.  But honestly i do not remember leaving work. ..I end up kinda snapping back to in my house just yelling "i cant help it im a fucking drunk! " to my girlfriend. Going out and clearing the car of any extra cans that where in there.  Finishing the secret blow stash I had.  Just a huge mess and black out.  So the next morning i call off work.  Puke.  Take like 5 baths.  Find this subreddit and get a badge.  But i have noone really to talk to.  I have no friends anymore because of either shit i did in the past  or during one of my non drinking stints cut everyone out. ..My dad is really big into aa with about 37 years sober.  Aa is not for me  especially with him being in the program everywhere. I have been in bed for 2 days.  My girlfriend forgives me pretty much.  It just sucks because this is like the third time i have stopped than went ape shit and something happened.  ..Everytime i relapse it just happens out of fucking nowhere.  I was in an outpatient group before my son was born  but had to quit because my medical plan they where supposed to help me with fell threw or sometime and they wanted like 130 bucks an hour or some shit.  I can quit drinking but like alot of others  its always when im doing great  than the voice comes out like "what? You gonna stop drinking forever? You have been doing fine.  You deserve this. " no.  There is no moderation for me.  I remember hearing in recovery  that everytime you relapse  its worse.  And for me  that has been true. ..I havent found this community before  but it might be just what I need to stay actively thinking about my sobriety.  I just dont have any family or friends.  Im in a constant state of depression because im almost 30 work a shit job and have no goals.  Drinking or not im a fucking wreck. ..So now in a few hours I have to go shamefully back into work and deal with this.  Im still sick. Ive woken up with sweat on my back the last 2 nights.  And it just sucks in general.  Everything.  I feel like I have wasted my life and am just a failure. Booze or no Booze.  Either way  I wont be drinking with you today. ..Thanks for the rant  and sorry for grammar.  I have been wanting to post this for awhile but havent had the energy the last couple days.  I guess ill try and move on.  Im just really down.
