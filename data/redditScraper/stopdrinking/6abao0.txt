Getting sober and staying sober was dependent upon so much more than just stopping my excessive consumption of alcohol. Sometimes I think about the pain that led me to this point and wow there was a whole lot of pain which led to change which led me here...The reason why I come back to this sub is because unlike a glossy photograph of a transformation story on TV or in a magazine at the store that devotes its pages to the happiness and fulfillment of the "after" this place helps me remember the ups AND downs of this path I'm on. ..I think about how when I started my journey I saw a month or a year in the same way: these pedestals of success and happiness. Everything would level out and be alright if I could just reach that one milestone. I'd have it all figured out right? Well I'm learning that it's not that simple. And that there isn't truly any "milestone." Being present in this moment sober is the milestone over and over...Looking back on it the struggles on the way make all of the good in my life that much sweeter.

Great quote and insight on it :) One of the things I love about SD is we are all here in the process of change together. Maybe we're at different stages or have different struggles but we can share the experience with each other and know that work was put in to get there. 
&gt;the struggles on the way make all of the good in my life that much sweeter...There are struggles in my life.  I just work to reduce the struggles created by my poor choices...Alcohol exaggerated and amplified my base tendency to indulge myself.  That robbed my spirit.  Alcohol starved my spiritual nature and fueled my self-centeredness.  ..As I continue to grow I indulge my selfish tendencies less and less often.  I actively (and often subconsciously) think about "others"...The chang s I consciously make help produce my butterfly...Great Quote!
