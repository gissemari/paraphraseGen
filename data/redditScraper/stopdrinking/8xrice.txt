To put this seemingly innocuous thing into perspective... I am a 5'2  34 year old American  woman. For 90% of my life I was  tiny . I am small framed with teeny tiny hands and feet (I wear a 5 1/2 shoe). I started gaining weight gradually up until the past year or so. I weighed myself a little over a month ago and I weighed 169lbs. I haven't weighed myself since but I just noticed that I no longer have a double chin! Other than quitting drinking I haven't done much differently. Actually I'm still struggling with the depression and anxiety that I was self medicating so I am slowly easing myself back into a  normal life . ..But guys! This is a HUGE boost to my self esteem right now! Small victory but I could think of no one else I wanted to share this with!

That is awesome! It's always encouraging  to see hard work pay off. I just got myself into a pair of shorts that previously I couldn't even zip. Now they're a little loose on me. Yay..I will not drink with you today  
Congratulations! Quitting is even harder when there were underlying issues that were being covered up- that's a big win. I wish you luck with the depression and anxiety.
Can you take mine please. 
I've gone through a similar transformation - turns out removing 1400 calories/day from my diet helped out with that so I empathize! Congrats on losing the weight - take that self esteem boost and run with it; the other stuff will get easier (never perfect but easier).
At 10 days I noticed my eyes brighter bags under them gone and skin clearing up.  I mean it was pretty awesome.  Then I screwed up over weekend.  IWNDWYT.
It is fucking bananas to think about how many calories of booze I've consumed in the last year
