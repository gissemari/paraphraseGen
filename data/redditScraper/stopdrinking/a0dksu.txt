All  Had an old user name i didnt remember.  I felt i should share this with you as I near one year of sobriety this week...AA 7th step / Biblical based - fair warning - \_\_\_\_..&amp;#x200B;..I hope that this helps one person scrolling though here on a Sunday afternoon who can relate.  My story is not for everyone but I share the hope with you all. I am not looking to debate my outlook on AA God etc. just sharing what worked for me.......&amp;#x200B;..Thx..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;..\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_..To my loving family and friends..I debated writing this letter for a couple weeks almost scratching it all together feeling that it was arrogant to sit down and brag about how great everything is today  I focus daily on being more humble and still feel uncomfortable about it.  That being said I feel obligated to share my story for the alcoholic still suffering. ..I know it is cheesy but I just thought of a funny way of looking at it.  Maybe we can think of this as my annual report to my shareholders updating you all on your investment returns. 2018 was a good year...The basic premise of AA is to give your life over to God.  Without a spiritual connection we are unable to do it alone.  Yes members generally have a different view of what this higher power means to them. This allows the program to reach more individuals who might struggle with the idea of God.  But by allowing God back into my life having daily quiet time and focus on growing spiritually every day I have regained my sense of spirituality.  I never lost faith but in the last few months of sobriety it has become clear to me that my close connection with God has never been more important to me.   ..** Grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.   (2 Peter 3:18)**..Recently I have read a lot about Simon Peter.  The more I read about him as an apostle the more I can relate to him and he says this verse in his epistle to the Romans.  I find it fascinating how Peter had a transformation spiritually after meeting Jesus.  He learned about his best character traits that could overcome his downfalls to become the early Church leader we have grown to know...I read recently how Jesus called Peter by his birth name Simon when he showed those flaws.  Before stepping into a life with Christ Simon was full of: resistance arrogance self-indulgence indifference animosity and cowardness.  I was struck by reading that.  In my program I have discovered that these same character flaws led me to my alcoholism and in turn simply lost. ..In turn Simon was transformed through life experiences into Peter.  Jesus gave Peter his name.  It means  The Rock.   Wow! What a visual.  I love that image.  Jesus knew that Peter was a natural born leader but that came with all the flaws I just mentioned.  Through Christ and the Holy Spirit Peter's learnings allowed him to lead the early Church as it grew across the land.  Peter learned how to: be submissive have restraint serve humbly show love be compassionate and express courage. I strive to walk like Peter daily...Okay I understand  Enough with the bible study   But I read this last month and was blown away how relatable to my program this was. I can now become that the  Rock  of my family by applying these same traits to my life. Alcoholics Anonymous has allowed me to practice these principles by listening to examples set forth by fellow sober members...I have been sober since November 27th 2017.  I was a  professional  by then.  I did everything a true alcoholic was doing. Lying and sneaking around to cover my habit.  Struggling through the day focused on that next drink.  I was waking up at 4am panicking about my drinking finances my marriage work you name it...  It was miserable.  I was stuck in this darkness about to lose everything I had left even tough I already had plenty of second chances.  I knew I had to stop drinking but I struggled until I finally decided I was going to stop for myself and no one else.  It was the first time in a long time I was making a decision like that...I went to my first week of meetings feeling sick and lost  all week.  Just unable to really process much except I knew I needed to keep just going to meetings and stay sober.  My head started to clear.  I was introduced to my sponsor on day four.  I was blessed that God was able to have that connection ready for me.  I was separated from my wife in my early sobriety.  It was a rocky few months as I had to continue to grow and work on myself before we could work on our marriage...Fast forward a few months I learned more about myself and why I was the way I was.  I kept listening to my sponsor and attending meetings.  I was lucky enough to maintain my work through this time.  It was at this time I really started to see how the program was paying off.  I started to do a lot more 11th step meditation and quiet time with God.  As my relationship with God grew deeper I continued to see the hard work pay off.  There is not one part of my life that has not improved by doing what is told of us to do in the big book.  When I finally listened it started working...Obviously I know that there will be trials ahead.  I know that I do not need to drink however.  My program is there to support me.  I plan on staying in the middle.  I will continue to attend meetings listening on how I can improve my sober life.  I owe all of what I have today to AA as it has shown me the examples of how I can be a true leader in my family and community. ..Thank you...To be clear one member is never  done  with AA.  It is not a cure.  On Sunday mornings I am surrounded by 30 people with the average sobriety of 30 years.   I am still working my steps and that you use the steps and revisit them throughout your life.  Yes there are relationships I can still improve.  Yes there are areas in my own life  that I am continuing to work on.  It has allowed me to open my eyes to who I want to be known for and my purpose.  I love being a part of this program.  It allows me to remember no matter what happens I can do it sober...Okay so you might be asking  What was the big secret to all this?  I have learned two major lessons this year about myself.  The first is how selfish I was in my drinking and how I needed to learn to put others before myself.  What a concept!  This concept allows me to refocus on what my purpose is particularly in my relationships with all of you.  I lived so self centered I could not use my strengths to serve others.  Secondly I am a leader and I need to allow those traits to shine through me.  It has made me a better boss at work by allowing myself to be more present. ..I feel like Peter today and less like Simon.  Yes sometimes I might have my Simon traits come out but I know I am a  Rock.   Every day I try to improve a part of me ever so slightly.  As the days go by this has done wonders.  I think of this spiritual growth like my weight.  It is hard to tell a big change when someone sees you often.  But when you do this for months at a time it becomes a lot easier task to lose more...I'll leave you with a powerful statement by Simon Peter  the Rock. ..** Be sober be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour. Resist him steadfast in the faith knowing that the same suffering are experienced by your brotherhood in the world.  But may the God of all grace who called us to His eternal glory by Christ Jesus after you have suffered a while perfect establish strengthen and settle you.  (1 Peter 5:8-10)**..I look forward to 2019 and the continued blessings God provides in all of our lives.  Feel free to share my story with whomever you feel needs to hear it...Love you all..God is so good
