Could you send one my way? ..I've been struggling a lot with getting sober.   Can only string a few days together before I cave.   Mentally I feel exhausted not just from the drink but also from the brain power I've been putting towards figuring out what's wrong with me on a deeper level.   ..Have been going to online AA meetings and trying to get involved and understand AA.   Just feels like all of my time is split between thinking about drinking  or thinking about not drinking. ..Thanks for listening/reading.

Praying for you.
Will do and remember you're never alone.
I'll pray for you... k it's on its way!
Sending prayers!..&gt;Just feels like all of my time is split between thinking about drinking or thinking about not drinking...I understand...The goods news is:  once I spend *most* of that time thinking about Not Drinking and couple it with actually Not Drinking Today it gets easier and easier.....  Then a day comes when I notice "I haven't thought about drinking or NOT drinking!"  ..Wow!   Amazing!..I hope you keep at it until that miracle happens!
I'm not the praying type. I'm the doing type...You didn't say if you had been gone to any in person AA meetings or connected with any sober AA people so here is what I will offer:..[AA.org](https://www.aa.org/pages/en_US/find-aa-resources) ..This is a list of AA Central Offices. Call the Intergroup phone number and talk to a real human. Their one purpose for being there is to connect people in need with the resources to stay sober...I was crippled by anxiety and fear. I didn't know how to create a meaningful connection...I was told that I could sit in a closet and pray all day for a hot dog but god won't shove one through the keyhole. I had to go out and get it. I hope you find what you need and I hope gods there when you do.
