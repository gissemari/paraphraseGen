Chronic relapser here and I just want to know how many people have had to literally change everything? ..Ive been drinking and using drugs since HS. My drugs of choice are alcohol and cocaine.  Ive had six months sobriety and some other short stints of being sober with light drinking in between...I keep noticing when I go back to being a really social person I feel compelled to drink. When I listen to rap music when I'm working out and get all my endorphins pumping I want a drink. When I listen to the joe rogan podcast I want a drink. Not so much that these things trigger me but they lull me into thinking I'm comfident or drinking is normal and I just did it overboard. ..The sad part is I've lost everything. Marriage kids freedom vehicles because Of my drinking. But someone how my crazy mind gets thinking I can go one more time. I am coming off a bad coke and booze bender. I just think everything in my life needs to get rebooted because all my time in AA outpatient repeated sobriety couldn't bring around permanent change. I can't do it again. The suicidal thoughts got too bad this time around and if I don't hurt myself I could hurt someone else again. It's just not worth it.

I had to move change jobs and drop some friends. I'm being serious. I will lose everything if I don't keep not drinking and to make it work for me I had to blow up my life. I will not drink with you today. 
For me I had to go through enough pain to be willing to change. I wasn't ready a moment before that because it took what it took...I got to AA and when I began working the steps I had to be fearless and thorough. Half-measures availed us nothing... If I wanted to change I had to be willing to do whatever was suggested of me because my way had me suicidal did a stint of homelessness bouncing off people's couches lost all sense of hope that anything could ever get better...The person I was would have kept drinking so I had to change the person I was...I think the bottom line was that I was willing. I'd had enough.
