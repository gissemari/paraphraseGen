I've learnt there is no such thing as 1 drink. I went for 17 months and a relapse ended in a 2 day binge.  ..I had another 118 day sober period and fucked up majorly this weekend.   ..I say fucked up. I didn't harm anyone but drank from Friday through to Sunday. I didn't eat and barley slept.    ..The bit I hate the most is lying to my friends my girlfriend and my family. They all knew I fell but were too polite to tell me. They accepted my bullshit excuse of being ill. Now it's 3-4 days extreme guilt and regret.  ..I'm not going to beat myself up. I've done well to make it this far.   ..But there is no such thing as 1 drink for people like me.   ..

With you on that. I won't drink with you today.
If 1 drink is enough I might as well stick with water. Gets me about as drunk. ..PS: you look good back in that saddle!..I'm not drinking with you today 
Glad you are not wasting time on beating yourself up because you don't deserve to be beaten up - you fell you got back up and you are moving forward. Congrats on coming right back!!! I will not drink with you today.
Me too no such thing as just 1 drink.  Tried to moderate for too too long and simply cannot because I don't want to catch a buzz I seem to want to get as drunk as possible as soon as possible every single time.  Welcome back.
