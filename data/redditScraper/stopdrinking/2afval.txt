hey. i like to check in here whenever i hit a milestone in my sobriety as i know a lot of people (myself included) struggle early in sobriety and i know the attrition rate is high. if someone as stubborn and stupid as me can do it so can you (granted it took about a hundred tries and a couple near-death experiences but so it goes).  ..six months in my life has changed in so many ways for the better. with all the money i've saved i was able to buy a new production computer for my home music studio and have been able to go part-time at my day job to focus on music stuff more. i was able to do a tour across the northeast and not drink a drop. i've been able to put together five records for a couple groups i work with and get a record deal and have interest for another record deal with a much more connected label. ..outside my art stuff my health is the best it's been since i started drinking in my early 20's (i'm turning 36 in a few days). i lost a bunch of weight i have a tan i eat three square a day and get a few miles in a few times a week. my relationship with my girl (who has been sober almost three years) has improved immeasurably. my levels of patience and understanding are at an all-time high; anger frustration and resentment are at an all-time low.  ..every now and then especially since summer has come i get a little pang of wanting to hang out on the deck at the grill with a beer but then i realize i really just want to do all the other stuff that feels good around that and that the drinking would only prevent me from doing it as i'd be committing to ten beers (there's no such thing as a beer or two in my world; ten is the price of entry and now it's just too much to pay for the predictable outcome). ..if you're struggling just remember that you're struggling against familiarity against the cold embrace of a cold one (which again is a lie; it's never one and you know it). you know the outcome of drinking and that's why you're reading stuff here. the animal part of your brain needs to be trained and it doesn't accept change easily. you can keep doing it and your life will be infinitely better if you do.  ..thanks so much for being there for me stopdrinking! i truly could not have done it without this sub being a button press away in trying times.

Awesome post! Congrats. I'm right behind you on the six month mark. :)
Nice work!
Hey /u/modulator_c - just wanted to thank youfor this post.  The following hit really hard:..&gt; every now and then especially since summer has come i get a little pang of wanting to hang out on the deck at the grill with a beer but then i realize i really just want to do all the other stuff that feels good around that and that the drinking would only prevent me from doing it as i'd be committing to ten beers (there's no such thing as a beer or two in my world; ten is the price of entry and now it's just too much to pay for the predictable outcome)...This is 100% my situation and I need to keep reminding myself of this.  So good to see it written out by someone else!  CONGRATS ON SIX MONTHS!!!
