You start again. There is NOTHING wrong with failing. Failing to stop trying is the problem! Wishing you well on your journey. I will not drink with you today.
I went to AA meetings after my relapse(s). It got me out of my own head and connected to other fellow alcoholics 
You're not alone.  I struggled by myself. I needed a new mode...I finally realized that it wasn't *lack of willpower* as my issue but rather *Lack of In Real Life Support*.  That's all I needed!..I went to meetings and immediately found people who understood what I was experiencing.  I got tools resources support and fellowship to first stop drinking and then to live sober...Now I just forgo ONE drink today - The First One..Never been happier!
For me recognizing that a relapse does not undo the work I've already done is important..."I'm drinking again" versus "I didn't drink for 42 days and drank for one." That's still *really* good. And it's good to get right back and add some more sober days.
I relapsed off and on for 9 months before it stuck. In Real Life support helped me greatly.
