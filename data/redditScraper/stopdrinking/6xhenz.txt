I had six months relapsed three months relapsed one month relapsed. Now I'm drinking several times a week again. ..What is going on with my brain? I keep going to meetings and before I would hear the message and now I don't. I have a belief in a higher power. I never thought I'd be back here again...Need some advice. I feel terribly sad and lost.

Going to meetings is different than working the steps. Have you been working the steps with a sponsor?
Sorry you're struggling. Sending you an internet hug.
Yes me too it's hard try to stay positive and take it one day at a time. You did this before you can do it again 
Have you tried reading the books? 30-Day Sobriety Solution and This Naked Mind. It helps me on a daily basis.
It's so hard no one on here just did it and it was smooth sailing. Most long term success stories have relapses. Be proud of what you accomplishment in stopping for as long as you did you did it once you can do it again. Hang in there 
All I can offer is the idea that each day is new. What we did yesterday is gone and we have a new day filled with choices. If you can decide to not drink today then you have done all you can do. When I take each day as a new start and know that I just have to not drink today it doesn't seem so unmanageable. Remember you are not alone.
