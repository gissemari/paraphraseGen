It's  better than another day drunk.Its a hard battlethis fight with addictions.I wish you the best in it.I will not drink with you today.
Yes it is a new day! Thank you for commenting. 
Day one is the most important day and it doesn't matter at all how many there have been &lt;3 I try to look at every day as day 1 so you and I are in exactly the same boat. ..Take care of yourself. It's very nice to meet you!
Not feeling so down about failure. Thank you so much for the encouragement!
Glad you are here! Many do not make it back. What are you going to do differently this time? 
I'm not sure if you read my post yesterday but in order for me to quit for good I had to change my mindset on how I viewed alcohol. .I hope this helps:.https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/7pfb0j/day_444_one_day_at_a_time_adds_up_fast_lurkers_if/?st=JCAMZ0SV&amp;sh=672bc037..Good luck
