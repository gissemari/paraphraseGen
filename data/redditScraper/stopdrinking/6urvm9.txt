Well done - that's a real achievement. And good advice to just deal with the 'here and now'.  
Congratulations!!
Congrats on TWO-Weeks u/Walton10 and Congrats on ONE-Week u/Sugarmeadow!  I *still* remember when I got to 10-days and in my heart I felt I had climbed Mt. Everest because I was so proud of myself for fighting the good fight.  I know it seems impossible to believe but in time drinking will Not consume your thoughts if you keep at it.  I Promise!  In my mind now I'm simply a non-drinker; and can't remember the last time I seriously entertained the idea of drinking.  Once I accepted that alcohol is no longer an option for me --Never Ever-- my recovery got a lot easier.  Keep it going you're doing great!
