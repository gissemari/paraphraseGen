If you have never heard of Augusten he has a book made into a movie called "Running With Scissors". He had a very unusual and unhealthy childhood and the movie/book is a glimpse into that insanity. .."Dry" is his memoir about his young adult like and dealing with alcoholism. Recently I've been struggling to stay sober and this book had a lot of moments where I could really relate. He romanticizes his relationship with alcohol something many of us do. I highly recommend it for those looking for a good read.

Reading memoirs written by recovering alcoholics has been a huge part of my recovery. I really liked "Dry" as well. It is one I wish I could erase from my mind so I could re-read it fresh.
Will check it out
Loved this book. 
LOVE this book!
Yeah I've read several of his books including "Dry." He's a talented writer. 
I just read this book as well. Was very good. I hope he's doing OK now.
Such a good book. I read it a few years ago. Thanks for posting. I need to read it again. 
One of my favorites! Read it many years ago and truly enjoyed it.
Great writer. I loved Dry as well as Running With Scissors.
That is such a good book; I loved it. Also: "Parched" by Heather King.  
I read it. Last year long before I decided to stop. Definitely made an impression.
