So I've got a bad back- like probable herniated disc trouble walking need help to stand/get out of bed excruciating pain-type thing.  Was doing conservative treatment (ice & non-steroidal anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen & acetominophen but it kept getting worse...Last week I was out on steroids nerve pain blockers and Vicodin.  Not too happy about it but had to accept reality and go with the recommendations.  Getting an MRI today so we can see what's up...So here's the good part- of course I talked to my AA sponsor husband and friends about taking the Vicodin just to be extra careful.  I've seen too many people relapse on pain pills so I put multiple safeguards in place...The best part is I don't LIKE the pain pills.  I'm not getting off in them since they are treating the pain but I do feel a bit groggy or fuzzy.  Not high but just not sharp and clear.  And I HATE it!  This is such an awesome gift.  I spent literally half my life (got clean & sober at 22 now I'm 43) chasing a buzz so I could numb out not be fully present not feel clear- and now I don't like that feeling at all.  But I also believe I am still and alcoholic and addict so these pain pills are out the window the minute I don't need them anymore and can go back to ibuprofen...I don't know yet whether I'm headed for surgery or can get by on physical therapy but for today I am very grateful to be reacting sanely with the meds and that I'm having an AA meeting at my house tonight- connected to HP & my sobriety network...Who would ever have thought there would be a day when I didn't *want* a chemical distance from life?.

I'm with you  /u/algohn on the herniated disc although mine came form a bike accident.  I did my pain meds per script and I'm a lot better now.  Off the RX and back biking.  Obviously everyone's situation is different but we live each day one at a time and it sounds to me like you are doing the best that you can possibly do given your situation.
Chronic pain is tough let alone in conjunction with  recovery.  I have a herniated disc add well as a bulging disc at l5-s1 and l4-l5 respectively.  I have had sciatica down my left right and both legs at times.  The body is much more plastic than I or most people realize.  I've gone from extreme pain to pain free.  I have to be careful and keep up with mobility work along with strength work.  Went from painful sitting/laying/walking to recently squatting 300 lbs pain free.  Don't know you're situation but hang in there.  Meditation can be very helpful.
