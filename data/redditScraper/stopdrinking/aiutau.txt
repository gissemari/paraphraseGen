My story starts like many others I got into alcohol the usual way with house parties and friends at high school. I always enjoyed the confidence it gave me and everyone seemed to love the centre of attention character it turned me into.  Then continuing to university it became a culture and a self perpetuating cycle where I felt people expected that over the top persona from me and without it i struggled to socialise. The norm developed where I always drunk to excess and threw up more times than I can remember. This eventually developed into the group I hanged out with experimenting with drugs. I loved most of them  and tried to sample everything I could while telling myself as long as it wasn't heroin or meth it was fine. This came to a peak in second year of uni where my grades dropped massively.  After getting a girlfriend who helped me calm down i managed to just about sort it out for my final year and get a good degree. But in my own stupid way I managed to get fucked up have a petty argument and cheat on her. After losing her and finishing my degree combined with having to move back home to my old dead end job I delved into a bit of a spiral. I had assumed I would calm down now that the party atmosphere was no longer present however I continued to find people able to fuel this habit and I constantly continued to drink. This was helped by having a casual Job that required no effort and I could take last minute days off.  The drugs mostly stopped due to me living with my parents or so I thought. Eventually during one Christmas after losing my job and my parents going away on Holiday I had an alcohol and drug fueled several weeks with friends where I started to even break that cardinal rule I had told myself of not drinking alone. With the excuse that "it's Christmas" I had several nights of finishing of multiple packs of beers and finishing off lines of ketamine where I couldn't  even walk upstairs to bed. My parents had previously told me they were concerned and had even made me visit a doctor to discuss this with but I never took it seriously. My first true moment of personal realisation however happend In to the new year. I had stupidly decided to take acid by myself and after a brief few enjoyable hours what followed was an introspective paranoid process.  It caused me to see myself as what I was becoming and that this problem was progressing since university and not decreasing. This was also amplified when one of my best friends called me out in my behaviour after a night out where I decided to take coke and mdma then blamed other friends for my choices and didn't take ownership myself. After that point I made major changes to myself  and started to take myself more seriously. I got a new job moved back to the city and became self sufficient once again. This was good for a while before I felt ostracized and had no close friends I started to drink out of pure boredom and even planned weekends of ketamine and NOS while watching films. This soon bled into the weekdays and I would turn up hungover fake sickness and even sleep in till my boss rang me to wake me up. After using all my "sick days" and with fear of losing my job I had to stop this habit and alternatively threw myself into my fitness as a way to occupy my time.  Since then Its been most of a year  and I have been doing fairly well using my fitness goals to keep me on track. However I have never gone completely sober after trying several times and it seems an impossibility with my current social circles. I decided to write out my story today after trying with real conviction to complete dry January but I failed it tonight after meeting my best mate and an old friend from university. The night was fine and I drank fairly sensibly while with them but then after they left I continued to drink and even did some cocaine not being able to call a stop to the night. This tendency to binge to excess seems to be a constant cycle that I can't control and I was wondering if anyone has any similar experience or advice for me. Thanks for reading my story and it feels good to type it all-out for the first time.
