This is an amazing article about news from the WHO. Just think about the sadness and human suffering behind these numbers- all that violence anxiety depression anger injuries disease . . . .I just thought this is sobering on how epidemic the struggle with alcohol is. Alcohol causes one in 20 deaths worldwide says WHO..https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/21/5-of-all-deaths-due-to-alcohol-who-says?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Copy_to_clipboard

The shit'll kill you for sure.
thank you for the read this morning. 
It's actually 1 in 20 deaths for people in their twenties. A good percentage of that is from accidents where alcohol was involved (driving) and suicides where alcohol was a factor. Big bummer but the title is a little misleading. ..Still sad to read. You could call these findings... Sobering.
