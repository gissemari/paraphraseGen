Louis Theroux's "Drinking to Oblivion" follows the lives of 3 alcoholics at different stages of their treatment and heir struggles with their inner demons. It's available on YouTube or for those who are tech savvy it's easy to download off a torrent site (not that I ever do that!). It may or may not help you but it's worth a watch. Not drinking today with all you wonderful people.

Yes I watched it. Very heart wrenching in so many ways.
This is on my watch list at home.  I'm HOPING that I can get to it before Wednesday since I think it might be useful in one of the groups I volunteer at and I want to tell my supervisor about it.
Thanks for the recommendation. I definitely want to watch this although I imagine it's probably difficult to watch.
