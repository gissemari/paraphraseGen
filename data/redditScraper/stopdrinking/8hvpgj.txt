I thought I hit rock bottom the first time I quit but here it is.  I must of gotten kicked out of half of the bars in town by now and maybe that's a good thing now I can't go back even if I wanted to.  And I don't want to I don't want to be this kind of person.  Getting hammered every night and making a damn fool of myself.  Throwing up in my room and being too wasted to even bother cleaning it.  Scaring my friends and family that I'll drink myself to death.  I guess I'm gonna get back on the wagon.  I could've been celebrating my 11 month sober today but instead I'm hungover piecing together the last week and feeling so so stupid

Yeah jump straight back on today is the best day to do it!
9 months is a great accomplishment nothing takes that away (certainly better than drinking that whole time!)..And you're just a bit wiser now. Use that!..Welcome back. We're all rooting for you. 
Welcome back.  Not stupid kinda typical - as it getting worse - so yeah **today not tomorrow  TODAY**  Don't drink do whatever it takes - see a doctor go to AA or Smart detox or rehab even... Whatever it takes.
Hang in there.  7 days for me to feel better.
