I'm in awe of the experience strength and hope that I see here every day.  ..The post from stcain02 illustrates to me the full circle of the depths of despair to the fulfillment of the 9th step promises...https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/47guu4/experience_strength_and_hope_from_a_low_bottom/..The honesty is humbling.  The perseverance is a tribute to strength.  The humility is moving.  The Gratitude shines like a beacon!  She is an inspiration.  For me her story IS the miracle of the 9th Step Promises.  Her family friends and colleagues are manifestations of the power of grace.  I was moved by her narrative  and it's a wonderful gift to me this morning...I'm blessed to work in an environment in which people regularly face adversity and in which others come to help.  I think of this community here in the same fashion.  Every contributor who reaches out in a caring way in an open honest way with humility giving support to those struggling sharing stories that aid others sometimes just BEING here for others all honor me with a little bit of their strength experience and hope.  Here's a great example:..When we think we have it bad think about these kids ....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihGCj5mfCk8..Have a Great Day!.

That was my mantra when bad things happened to me (not alcohol related) and it helped frame my perspective.  Thanks for the good work you do for us here at SD.
