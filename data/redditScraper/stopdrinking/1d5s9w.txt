I always tried to figure out what I couldn't do while drunk.  Mostly I went to meetings and chatted on stopdrinking IRC...Get around other sober people.  There's more to sobriety than making a pledge and for me it was immediately easier when I got myself in the company of other sober alcoholics.  "I can do this" was the feeling I got and I suddenly felt like a sober person.  It changed the whole game for me.
You're doing awesome. 4 months is an inspiration for me. If you're in tonight maybe watch a movie or do some reading or exercise? That might help you get over the hump. 
Are you currently in AA or willing to give it a chance?  My advice is to go to a meeting tonight.  You might think it's not for you but people in your situation are the reason it exists.
Hey stopdrinking1 hope today was easier for you I've heard a caramel milkshake can work wonders... Eating has become paramount to me  when I stopped drinking and smoking if I don't eat (regularly) my mood can dip really low and the idea of drinking gains appeal. apestate has suggested finding IRL support and that can't hurt either. In fact I can't second that enough. And of course we are always here. :)
