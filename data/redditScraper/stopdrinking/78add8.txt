I just noticed this is my 111th day of sobriety. I get a kick out of those special milestones. I'm still amazed and delighted that I've come so far thanks to the support and shared wisdom of this subreddit. I wish I could tell you why this time feels so different after years of working on sobriety and relapsing. I don't miss booze much at all. I am really happy to be free of the hangovers guilt and wasted time. When I get a craving I quickly remember the reasons why being sober is so much better. I still have crappy days but at least feeling sick and disgusted with myself isn't a part of them. Cheers to not drinking with you today!
