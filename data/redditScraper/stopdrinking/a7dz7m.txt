Hello friend out there!..As you can see it in the title I made the strangest choise what a "normal" 20 yo could do. I stopped drinking exactly one year ago and didn't relapse. Not even once. Thus I  mean to  share my  story  with you...The reason why I stopped drinking is mainly my first blackout experience. Yea the next day after the boozy night I felt the shame more than anything as I woke up in a hospital needle dangling fron my arm not knowing where or who am I..It was a damned big slap from life. Probably the biggest I've ever got so far..Believe or not I did not have a hangover after. (And never before). I just felt that I'm the biggest disappointment for myself...So I decided that I would not touch anything alcoholic. Never again. My friends did not believe in me neither my family but it didn't matter because I did. It was enough...And you know what? At first I got a strange thought of my youth. We are extremly exposed to alcoholism. Some could probably reduce the amount later but many of my friends get drunk every week or even worse serveral times a week. And it's somebody's only "hobby". Partying. It's kinda frightening...One can drink for serveral reaeons (to forget problems for one night get courage to do thing what we wouldn't dare sober just to enjoy the lit feeling etc...).Meanwhile many of us forget to enjoy life while being sober. Or can't really enjoy the experience without a beer or a shot of vodka..The highlights or a stundent's year are the hardbass parties where everyone would feel akward AF if there wouldn't be any booze at all. It feels strange isn't it?..From my side of the story I only gained from my habit;.  Before I felt strangely tired with no reason from time to time. This disappeared after 2 weeks of abstinence..  Before I needed some kind of drink down in the belly just to accost an attractive girl. Now (knowing that I would not have that "liquid courage") I am one of the most confident dudes around..  Before I did not consider myself a good person so nobody noticed me. Now many of my friend look up on me and many remark me becasue of my strange habit..  Before I did not see my future clear did not have a plan for it. Just went to school learnt what was necessary and nothing more. Today I study in one of the best universities of my country to become an engineer. I feel motivated most of my days and prepared everything to come...Long story short; This little habit made me realize some strange things of today and changed what I am and what I'm going to be. .

I am so happy for you. Recognizing and quitting at such a young age is awesome.  Man I wish I could have done that.  ..IWNDWYT
So awesome! Congrats on 1 year. Huuuuuge. ..I too have had really scary moments when people told me they were scared I was going to die of alcohol poisoning. Never went to the hospital but that doesn't mean I shouldn't have. It scares me to think I could have choked on my own vomit in my sleep or went into a coma. I had a hard time controlling how much I drank. Over time I learned how to tolerate my booze but also my tolerance went way up as I became a daily drinker in my mid 20s. ..When I look back at my early drinking episodes (hs and college) almost all the times I drank I blacked out and drank dangerously. Almost all my friends in recovery say the same... they drank and they blacked out. There wasn't often times when we had A SINGLE drink and left it at that. We were on a quest for that high and often over did it. ..I'm proud that you cut the head of the snake before it grew into something more ugly like active alcoholism. It's not glamorous. You're not  missing out.  In fact your discovering the keys to life so early! Count yourself the luckiest of the lucky. ..Keep it up. I will not drink with you today.  
Good on you. This sub is filled with people who wish they'd quit at 20. (I know we're supposed to speak from the "I" here but I've seen people say that.)
There is a blogger called Beth Leipholtz who got sober before she was 21. To this day she hasn't had a drink...Check her out it might help you   You are doing the right thing and credit to you for being mature enough to question your drinking...IWNDWYT.
