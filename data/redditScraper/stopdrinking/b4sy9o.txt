Well this will be my second post in this group.  After my first post I relapsed.  It's not an easy thing to admit but if I truly want to recover I need to admit this.  I've been reading a lot of posts here and they have been helpful.  Tonight was very difficult.  I had the opportunity to get a bottle but somehow managed not to.  Work stress sleepless nights withdraw they all drew me to the liquor store.  I truly don't know how I managed to stop myself but I did.  ..My hands still shake.  My dreams are a random cluster of everything.  I wake up frequently in sweats.  Daily stress seems more pronounced.  Yet I'm finally starting to see that this is a symptom of withdraw.   I know I need to hold out but it's hard...What I think I need right now is a good anchor.  I can use some advice on the next stage from those of you who have gone through this.  ..What should I expect next? How should I prepare myself?

The first time I got sober (for two years) the first few days of sobriety my mantra was "I'm not drinking."  Over and over I said this to myself.  I white knuckled it that way for 6 days.  Day seven....the tension eased noticeably.  I got some mental and physical slack and incrementally from then on it got easier and easier until by the second or third week I was experiencing joy in daily life again.  I made sure to take note of when joy entered my heart.  It happened more and more.  By the end of my first month of sobriety...the tension was a wet noodle with occasional lightning strikes of craving that quickly passed...I loved my sobriety but I didn't take care of it.  I didn't protect it and so one day after being sober for a couple of years I answered the door when the poison came knocking and I let it in.  I thought "Hey I've PROVEN that I have self control...I haven't drank for 2 whole years!"  Just opening that door was my big fucking mistake.  I was trapped in a 3 year bender of drinking 750 ml of vodka every freaking day 'til I finally could muster another day 1...I relapsed a couple of more times and now I'm here...I've found that reading This Naked Mind and this community has been of great help.  I'm over a month sober and I'm grateful that I am.  I'm experiencing joy again while paradoxically living through one of life's greatest pains (my wife is dying).  It's fucked up beyond belief but I'm facing it all with clarity and I wouldn't want it any other fucking way...ever...So I doubt any of that helped and I just dumped a load of my garbage on your thread...I am sorry.  I guess I just want you to know that a joyful life without being a slave to alcohol is possible.  I've lived it...  I found that alcohol poisons the well of joy.  I hope you get through these early physical and psychological withdrawals so that you too can experience the joy and gratitude life gives and alcohol steals.
[watch this](https://youtu.be/CrTlI6seM0A) ..I watched this a number of years ago and I stopped drinking for around 6 weeks or so. I made a point of rewatching it again a few days ago to keep hammering home in my brain that I'm not drinking...I've never been as bad as this guy but I would be well on my way if I didn't stop drinking. It's heart wrenching and terrifying to watch. So yeah take the 45 minutes today to watch this. There's no way you'll want a drink after watching
