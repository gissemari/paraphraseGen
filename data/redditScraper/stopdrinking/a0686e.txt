I haven't lived closer than 800 miles from any family in over 7 years.  However they're some of the select few people who know about the struggles I've had with the booze and how bad things got.  Anyway I consider this sub part of my family that I can reach out to and helps to keep me straight.  ..Maybe the holidays have me in my feelings a little bit but thank you to everyone here.
