I love seeing all the success posts here but this one is a bit different. I've tried and failed to stop drinking on my own. It's caused problems with my academics relationships and work. I need help and I think removing myself from my current environment even short-term to build some good habits would really help me but I don't know how. ..24m I've struggled with depression and anxiety for about 10 years now. I work a job that requires 80+ hours/week and I've fallen back into old bad habits of abusing alcohol. I've been in a really dark place and it's been affecting my performance at work I want to get sober and get help but when I spoke with my supervisor I was told maybe I could take some time off in a few months and that maybe these issues are just in my head. Pretty unbelievable response but now I need to know what my options are. I work at a large company and my supervisor is just one individual so he doesn't speak for the whole firm. Does anyone have experience with taking a leave of absence from work to get sober? Any insight would be really appreciated along with references to any other subreddits that might help.

Check out your Employee Assistance Program (EAP). I didn't take advantage of mine but a friend did. The EAP helped him find a rehab navigate the leave paperwork and ease the transition back to work.
I will second the suggestion of EAP - I do not know the ins and outs of the ADA  Americans with disability act I think but there are protections and mandates in place.  ..This sounds like something that needs tackling now.  Good luck stay in touch.
I wouldn't use your EAP if you have a professional license to protect unfortunately.
Check FMLA site for most companies of a particular size they have to yield to FMLA - I took FMLA. Feel free and PM me - staining the deck but I will respond !
