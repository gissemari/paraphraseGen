First of all thank you reader for taking a moment to view this. A few preliminary items: First I am currently sober and wide awake at 1:30AM and having to be up for work in 5 hours. This is not by choice I usually have Lady Liquor tuck me in. Secondly my last drink was around 8pm on Sunday 6/11; I am a 33 and have abused alcohol pretty consistently since I was 21. Finally I love reddit and  have lurked on reddit for approximately 7 years. I share that because I have only observed so bare with me as I stop finally evolve from a lurker to a true redditor...I am here for a reason -and I imagine anyone reading this is for their own unique reason. Likely each of us is here because a specific event statement action or whatever was the impetus behind our presence. Also likely to be true is that whatever catalyst brought you here today was just the most recent in a long line of reasons/motivations/desires for sobriety.  ..The reason I am here now is because of what happened on the night of my drink and continued into the following day. Late last week  I was on a mini-vacation with my partner. Accompanying us were his aunt uncle and young adult cousin. His family is very close and this trip meant a lot to them. Also despite the fact I have been with my partner for ten years this trip would be the most time I had spent with his family. As additional context it is important to understand that my partner drinks socially but almost never around his family. I have never seen anyone else in his family (save his step-dad having a beer or two). They aren't teetotalers they just don't drink. ..For the majority of the trip I was relatively well-behaved. I abstained from drinking in the morning -except that morning where I felt a bit of a hangover and decided I'd better take a few swigs of vodka to turn it into a carry over. This is my MO when it comes to day-drinking. It's that or fully embracing/exploiting any event/celebration/holiday in which day drinking is embraced (or at least not completely frowned upon.)  ..The first night I drank but was only slightly "buzzed" this is relative of course because  a person with normal drinking habits would likely have been wasted. The next night to reward myself for "not getting wasted" I decided to amp it up a bit.  I woke up the third day with that hangover/carry over I mentioned earlier quickly adding more liquor to my alcohol soaked self. The third night  low on alcohol but still ready and willing to drink I "only" got "slightly buzzed." This was only because that was all that my liquor supply would allow. The next day I felt actually pretty good almost as good as if I had not drank at all. I had a great day following my unwillingly low alcohol intake the night before. Despite having a great day -a big part of which was attributable to the fact that I wasn't hungover -  those "reward" drinks were calling. I had whats become an evermore common inner monologue about whether or not I really even WANTED to drink. I long ago admitted/accepted that I SHOULDN'T drink regardless of desire. However as per usual before concluding that indeed I did not truly want to drink at all - even if drinking magically had no ill effects (on my body on my mind on my relationships on my wallet). But then I convinced myself as I have many times before that all the reasons/justifications to drink were valid including but not limited to: "I'm on vacation; everyone drinks on vacation; It will put me in a nice mood clam me down; I've been good - I can let loose a little; I can drink if I want to damn it;" and most importantly "sobriety is sooo boring!"..These falsehoods convinced me last Saturday night as they had many times before that despite my keen awareness of their untruthful nature I STILL wanted to drink. I also considered how I would surely regret drinking - regret wasting the money regret ingesting the calories regret the continued punishment of my major organs regret slurring stumbling saying something offensive and generally being an ass. I was certain that I would regret the way I would feel the next day.  Beyond all those perfectly reasonable  and rational motivations not to drink I knew I would regret disappointing/hurting/annoying/worrying/failing my partner. My partner who has stood by me while I have all but resigned myself to a painful pitiful life as an alcoholic.  I know he is just about at his wits end  with me (perhaps he is beyond that point). I cannot deny that he has every right to be angry to be disgusted to not want to be with me at all...He had every right to leave me several years ago when I stupidly and dangerously drove home (alone) wasted out of my mind. He woke around 2AM to find me outside the front door in subzero temperatures snow on the ground. I stood there in my underwear covered in vomit and incoherent. I was fortunate that he let me in let alone that he cleaned me up and cared for me. Miraculously I didn't hurt any other person or property that night (unless you count the vomit I had covered the drivers seat in). That terrible night was in 2009 it is one of my worst examples of dangerous/thoughtless/reckless alcoholic behavior but it is far from my only one. There are many more like it thankfully I have not hurt anyone physically (other than myself in relatively superficial ways) and I hope that I never will...So back to my final night of vacation despite having a million motivations not to drink I caved-in (to myself? my addiction? my lies?) and bought a bottle of vodka. It was a 750ml bottle. I decided that amount would be my max intake for the night as I was with other people and had a long journey home ahead of me the next day. Once back to the house I went to my room -need to be out of sight can't let anyone actually observe this behavior - and eagerly opened the bottle. I took a giant swig. It was lukewarm and tasted what I imagine rubbing alcohol must taste like. I felt the sting of shame guilt regret and all the other negative feelings a person might experience is such a situation. As I wiped the precious drops of vodka that had annoyingly missed the inside of my mouth and now soaked my beard I considered what I was doing.  I considered those negative emotions I was feeling but the pause was brief and I continued down the path I had now accepted as fate at least for that night. I drank about 3 shots in my first swig and one more for good measure after my quick consideration of perhaps stopping. I put down the bottle after that second swig only to return about 15 minutes later "why am I not feeling it yet- let's get this party started!." Keep in mind I am the sole attendee of this 'drinking party' literally no one else present is drinking. I was not denying drinking but I attempted to be discreet about it. This ugly dance continued until about 7:45PM at which time I sucked down the final drop from that 750ml bottle. I am not a small person by any means but that amount of alcohol in such a short time is dangerous for anyone. I have known this to be true since I was much younger but I have disregarded that truth time and again in favor of getting drunk ASAP. Drinking is bad binge drinking is terrible consistently binge drinking is terribly bad -and literally deadly. ..I remember that last drink relatively well but the rest of the night is a fog if not completely absent from my memory. I recall a few "proud moments" like standing above the outdoor fire-pit and screaming a demand of "more wood - bigger fire." Another foggy memory relates to the same fire though my attitude had apparently changed -I remember screaming that it was essential that I put out the fire at that very moment and sloppily grabbing the nearby hose to get the job done. Most everything after that is a blank. I literally do not remember getting to bed an especially scary proposition as the room my partner and I shared was a loft style and the stairs were so steep that they would be more accurately described as a stationary ladder. No doubt I survived that night relatively unscathed because my partner was there - as had been the case many time prior. ..I woke up the next morning with a pretty powerful hangover - not one of mine where I actual consider that it is a real possibility that I am dead. It was one I would force myself to push through and go to work had I had to work that day.  One of those pretend to be ok because I only allow myself a few days a year where my hangovers prevent me from participating (at least minimally) in society. I was of course filled with the same regret I had known would arrive but that feeling was then replaced with annoyance that I could not take a good swig of a bottle for the hair of the dog but two things prevented that: 1) I drank all that there was; and 2) I had promised to drive part of the way home the night prior. So I went though the motions of getting ready convincing myself I would not get sick and I hadn't drank THAT much. I was seemingly ok for a bit but then the urge to vomit arose. This is  a "special" vomit that only comes after a night of extreme drinking. It is as if my body has concluded that I cannot be trusted to put anything that is NOT poison in my body - so everything is rejected out of hand and to be sure anything that remains must be expelled as well. Certainly any food is out of the question as well as liquid including water - not a great thing when  already severely dehydrated. To add insult to injury what was awaiting expulsion was a terrible concoction primarily composed of foul smelling -and tasting -bile. It was held at bay for awhile and I even felt "good" (a relative term when you spend a good amount of your life drunk or hungover). I was able to hold back for a good couple of hours. Soon I would be on the road 16 hours after my last drink I was sober. I felt like death but I needed to drive (keeping up appearances and all that). I drove for a few hours without issue. Then the urge to puke hit me - hard. I was driving down the highway I threw up in my mouth. Left with the options of either spitting the contents of my mouth all over- the dashboard myself and the passengers- or swallowing it I chose the latter. I almost got away without being noticed but my partner knows the drill just as well as I. "Did you just throw up?" he asked "No I just had a big burp - everything is Ay-OK here." I was not fooling him he knew it I knew it. and he knew i knew it. I must shamefully admit that this was the fourth such time in our relationship where on the journey home following a vacation where I reliably over imbibed that night before and I became physically ill and needed to puke at the worst possible times. Happened twice before on car trips and once on a flight from Hawaii - I experienced one other incident a year or so before meeting my partner also on a full plane that was still taxing... Despite all of this I continued to drive. About an hour later as I was minimizing how dire my situation had become the urge to vomit came back with a vengeance. This time I knew there was no stopping it. I frantically searched for any spot that would allow enough space for me to pull over enough not to block the highway lane never mind considerations of safety beyond that. Finally I brought the car to a stop and leapt out and ran to the other side to expel the toxins. My partner all to familiar with my drinking and what later follows knew exactly what was happening. I am not sure what his family (also in the car with us) thought as I wordlessly and urgently pulled to the side of the road and exited the car to puke. After that  occurrence I realized that I could not continue to drive. Defeated by my own actions from the night before I turned the keys over to my partner who is ever present and ever able to assist me in times of alcohol induced incapacity. I had to ask him to pull over twice during the remainder of the trip. ..Once home my feelings of regret and shame were beating me down exacerbated by the physical pain that had yet to fully subside. I knew I had only faced some of the consequences of my drinking. Now I was alone with my partner who has experienced this behavior too many times to count - a partner who had and still has every right and reason to dump a drunk like me. A drunk who admits his ways and concedes change is necessary but ultimately his sobriety lasts only a few days. It lasts only a few days because the pain both physical and emotional from the last binge drinking session has been somewhat lessened by the passage of time. Soon creeping into my mind are the rationalizations of why it is not only "ok" for people in general to drink but perfectly appropriate for me personally to drink. Just like the consequences that motivated me to be "sober" for a couple of days came in stages so do the justifications for me drinking again. Once I have convinced myself that because "I will not overdo it and I'll drink plenty of water and because I am otherwise 'healthy' I can drink"  and "hey I actually WANT to drink."..I want to drink because fuck the work behind actually trying to address the reason I make the same mistakes over and over again. I want to drink to have fun and feel good (despite mountains of evidence that the exact opposite is true.) It is as if some unconscious  part of me has determined that being in a near constant condition of inebriation is ideal - a bizarre determination even if one were to assume drinking actually resulted in me having true fun or feeling good - because the physical impacts on my health alone should be sufficient to dissuade me. Once I have disposed of all of those reasons why not to drink. A reason that is not so easily dismissed and must be overcome before I can stop being sober and start drinking. I know my partner won't be happy about me drinking. I know that on top of it being unhealthy expensive annoying embarrassing terribly un-sexy and just plain inconsiderate it hurts him because he didn't fall in love with a drunken slob that's not who he wants or deserves. ..Despite knowing that my own life and his happiness  should be motivation enough to give it my best that subconscious need to drink takes me to that place where even my life and the happiness of the most important person in my life can be set aside.  "Ugh" I'll think to myself "who is HE to judge me. I have never got a DUI I have never been arrested I have never been fired from a job. I am gainfully employed I do what is expected of me and certainly what is required -well at least what is expected and required as far as work and civilized society - can't be everything to everyone after all." At this point with that glimmer of hope and love that exists at my core struggling to exist my alcoholic mind plays it's final card. The desire to be the person my partner feel in love with and the person he deserves is overcome battered by a resentment which is rising inside me - a resentment that is nothing more than a manifestation of my addiction. An irrational unreasonable unjustified resentment towards the one person who has stood by me despite me giving him my worst and a person whose desire for me to not drink is not completely selfish - I know he legitimately does not want me to continue my path towards a premature grave. I have attempted to stop drinking a few times before longest period in recent history was just over three weeks - I relapsed so hard that I pissed the bed for the first time in my adult life after convincing myself I had proven my ability to control myself during my sober stint. Here I am again acknowledging the need for a change. A place where I move forward believing that at the very least I need  and want to stop drinking for my partner's sake because I cannot continue to hurt the one person I love so much and I certainly cannot lose him. This time there is a difference and that is what compelled me to come on here today. I know that I cannot undertake this admittedly difficult and long path for anyother person than myself. This is a path with no end and will have no shortage of obstacles detours and tempting "rest stops." I know there are many others who I may meet (hopefully here and in-person) who will be on similar paths of sobriety but each path is necessarily unique. I have realized that I can count on support to get me on the right path and I can rely on support from others to stay on the path but at the end of the day I also realize that only I can travel my own path because my life my experience my sobriety are mine alone. I am not denying that my life impacts others' lives and vice versa. However at the end of the day my "battle" is with something that has become part of me and because of that I am the only one able who has to true power to keep the demon I am battling at bay. I know that others can offer support and advice and even hold me up when I may be unable to stand but my drinking and the desire to drink exists within me I have attributed my desire to drink to outside factors and therefore I have similarly concluded that only outside factors can eliminate that desire. This is a real battle and it is internal. I want to believe though that I finally have a tool that I had been missing when I previously attempted this project - the knowledge that this is up to me and it will only work if I want it. And I truly do I want to be happy I want to feel good I want to live a long life and I want to remember it. I want to continue to spend time with those I love. Other people and outside forces may be necessarily linked with what I desire but ultimately I and I alone determine what choices I make I decide what take priority. I am hopeful that my acceptance of the fact that it is ultimately only I who determines my sobriety will help me keep perspective and help me stay on the path. I NEED to be sober and I finally truly believe that I WANT to be sober - not just in the general sense of "not drunk" but in the sense of truly alive. ..
