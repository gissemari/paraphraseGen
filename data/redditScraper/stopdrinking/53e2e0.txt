I have been trying to stay sober but always relapse whether it be a week 2 weeks a month. How do you guys sustain it? I need to do something different because what I'm doing now isn't working.... Thanks

Well start by telling us what you are doing now that isn't working.
I go through a pattern where I get hammered. Wake up the next day with horrible regrets. Say I'm never going to do it again and don't for a while. Then I slowly lose my will power lie to myself that I have control and repeat the cycle. I swear I forget or convince myself that I can somehow have one drink this time and not end up drinking all night until I'm blackout. I have to change something or this pattern will just continue.
