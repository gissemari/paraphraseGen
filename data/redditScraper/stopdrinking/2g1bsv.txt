My friend has been relapsing more and more often as of recent. Although I'm trying to help him out by attending meetings with him telling him to call me before he takes a drink and by buying him gifts that he can use to help maintain his sobriety (headphones so he can workout record player needle so he'll have a working record player for music books ect) I feel as if I'm enabling him...I'm the only support system he has and although I've suggested going to meetings more often it's ultimately his decision. I've been in his place and I know what hardships he's going through but I'm getting tired of being his only support system. I feel that if he continues down this road and doesn't seek out more help than myself I'll be compromising my own sobriety and will have to end our friendship. I can't imagine having to end a friendship with someone when they need a friend the most...I feel guilty for thinking this way angry at him for not doing more about his problem and scared that I may loose a friend over this.

You might find /r/AlAnon a good resource for getting appropriate feedback on your feelings of co-dependency on your troubled friend.
Have you heard the saying "you can carry the message but you can't carry the alcoholic"?..
