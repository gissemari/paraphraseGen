Despite encountering a suicide attempt and an unpleasant stay at a crisis center and an ugly break up due to a drunken tirade I can honestly say I've never been more hopeful...Although I'm still dealing with the mental hurdles following the mentioned events today I went to my fifth consecutive AA meeting. I am at 26 by far the youngest attendee at my meetings which has actually worked for my advantage since the other members have provided me with invaluable life advice...I'm still struggling to be alone with my thoughts something I understand is a natural part of my journey. The advantages of having down time not occupied by drinking has yielded the wonderful opportunity to read FOUR whole books in the span of my sobriety! When I'm not reading I spend my time walking my precious pup and going to the gym...Although it's my second of many times posting here I do my fair share of lurking. You guys along with my AA group family and friends have been all the motivation I need to say that I will not drink with you today...Cheers (with water) to another day guys hope all is well!

Congratulations on one week!! Reading books is nice isn't it  I never could find the time to do things like that when drinking.
Congratulations on a week that's great! Also glad to see you stepping out of the shadows. Participating made a world of a difference to me! Keep up the good work I will not drink with you today!
