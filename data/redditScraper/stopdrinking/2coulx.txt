Keeping that SOB booze at bay.  Every day the stories I read here help keep me motivated--thanks for sharing your own struggles.  Now onto another day goal and with the 1 year mark as a distant objective!

Super job!
congratulations! You got some time in now my friend you've probably started to see the benefits of your sobriety and the struggles are probably getting a little lesser than they once were...Honestly though it's around that 1 year mark where people hit a rough patch so be prepared for it
GRATS!
Congrats! Keep up the great work
