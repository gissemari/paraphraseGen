My badge should be resetting sometime soon (this past Sunday).  I've been sober for most of the year. Have lost a lot of weight got engaged to girlfriend of several years this spring. Got a job again after traveling the world for 18 months during a 20 something "retirement." Much of which was sitting around a random city/beach stupid drunk...A few relapses since I said "never again" in February.  ..Overall a decent year I guess...Damn was it hard not to stop by the gas station to buy beer.  ..But damn being sober and fully aware is that much better...Still don't know if AA is for me won't be finding out tonight..

Bummer! You checking one out tomorrow? 
Whenever one meeting closes another one opens up close by.  That seems to be the story where I am from.  Maybe try ring them and find out what the story is.  Your name is strangely familiar BTW?  Good to have you back on board.
So nice to see your username again /u/needmorecowbe11 -- good luck on the AA meeting.  Please update us!
It's a sign!..That you should try a different meeting!
You should notify the local Intergroup that the meeting you tried to go to wasn't there so that they can check it out and update the meeting list if need be.  Just google "AA [YOUR CITY] [YOUR STATE]" and you'll likely find the number for the local office.  Might also find the most up to date meeting list there...Good job coming to SD instead of picking up booze!
