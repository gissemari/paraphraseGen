Back in 2018 I lasted 2 months in Jan-Feb and then 3 months in August-October.  It was the best I'd done in over 9 years.  ..I been struggling since then though.  I don't even know who that person was that did that 3 month stint of sobriety. He was a different person in a different frame of mind.  Now I just feel like a pile of hopelessness.  The days of depression and apathy and irritability are reduced me to hating life and having a zero positive outlook on the future.   ..I've greatly reduced drinking though.  Maybe once a week and 3/5 times that was only 1 - 2 beers.  I haven't had a 2 or 3 day binge in months.  ..But I'm living in this constant needling of dread that I've destroyed my body and mind and life is never going to be the same even if I can stop drinking.  I keep telling myself I'm still in the fumes of repeated alcohol use and that maybe my brain and body haven't leveled out.  ..&amp;#x200B;..Guess I'm just wallowing in my own misery and can't seem to drag myself out of this pit.  ..And now I'm barely making my bills as it is and I'm about to take a $500/month pay cut. I figured out a budget and it seems we're only going to have about $35 extra pocket change a week after living expenses. That ain't helping my mood at all.  And we can't move cause my step-sons biological father won't let us move outside of the current school district.  ..&amp;#x200B;..Sometimes I feel like I'm holding on to reality by a thread.  ..&amp;#x200B;..My only saving grace is that I seemingly can't drink more than 6 beers these days without feeling so awful it turns me off from drinking more. ..&amp;#x200B;..Anyways I needed to vent.  Got a lotta shit festering in my soggy brain right now.  ..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;.. ..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;

Let's take it one day at a time. I'm proud of you even if you're not feeling the best these days. All things pass including nasty emotions. 
Even though it might not feel like it you've got some sober stints under your belt so you can do it .. day by day  . Keep coming on here everyday and remember your not on your own going through this ! 
Drinking them 6 IPA's and the hangovers that came with it is enough to keep me away..You got this bro stay strong and busy
