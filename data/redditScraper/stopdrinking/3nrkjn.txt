I've been lurking here for a while now. I've made several attempts to cut back on my drinking going as long as 13 days but always relapsing. A few weeks ago I was in a very dark place. (I struggle with depression and anxiety as well as several chronic pain conditions.) I was extremely depressed and it got to the point where I was beginning to think about death a lot. I wasn't quite suicidal but I knew that feeling wasn't far behind. I just wanted to drink my sorrow and anxiety away (and I did.. until the next morning.) ..I went back to my doctor to have my anti depressant increased. A few days later I had a revelation. I had been drinking during the day something I rarely did until a few months ago. I was about to go out and pick up my kids from daycare. I had my shoes on my keys in my purse and I was almost out the door. And then I stopped. And then I realized: I could lose my kids. If I had shown up to the daycare drunk and dazed it would have been obvious to the assistants that I wasn't fit to parent in that moment. They are mandated reporters and would have reported me to CPS (and they should.) ..I put my stuff down. I took off my shoes. I texted my husband and asked him to pick up the kids because I couldn't do it. I couldn't go out and get them. While I'm glad I did the right and responsible thing that day I'm still struggling. I'm on day 2 of not drinking. I think about it constantly - from the moment I wake up to the moment I either cave in or go to bed. The crying of my boys makes me want to drink. My homework (I'm a student mom) makes me want to drink. Financial issues make me want to drink. There is no escape from this constant consuming desire to drown out my anxiety and feel good even if just for a few hours. ..I hate who I've become. I hate this addiction. I hate that it takes up so much of my time energy and money. I feel lost and broken. I don't know how to be strong enough to do this.

Welcome. I'm a mom too. I can relate a lot to your post. I am sober over a year now and I'm the best mom I've ever been...Things can get so much better. It's hard work but so worth it.

Gday lady you're not the only one. I'm the same and we're fighting together as a unit. If you want to feel free to add me on a chat app and we can literally fight it together. Either way don't give up it's shit being a drinker.
I'm a mom too. Welcome! I relate to your post very much and drank for many of the same reasons. I am a lifelong anxiety sufferer since early childhood. I started drinking around age 12. I am now 46. For the first time ever in my life my anxiety is under control and at times not even there. I actually feel peace and joy and calm and happiness now. I have sobriety to thank for that. .
Welcome. I'm a mom to a toddler and have PTSD and had post partum anxiety. I relate to a lot of what you wrote...My mom committed suicide when I was a child and I know well how day drinking and endless hangover cycles can make thoughts turn dark. For myself realizing that I was either going to drink myself to a state where I killed myself or else the drinking itself killed me was what rang the alarm bells in my head that I had to get sober...After the initial white knuckling of the first couple of weeks things got better. It doesn't feel like it will at the time but I have learned how to unwind and relax without the alcohol. One of the biggest things that helped me in the early days was giving myself permission to tap out and have my husband step in with our kid while I went and did something alone or in silence. Giving myself permission to practice self care was crucial. As women and especially mothers we tend to be pounded with the message that we must always be "on" and available.. But the truth is it's ok to put on your own oxygen mask first...Any way I went with therapy a PTSD support group and a vivitrol shot to start my sober journey. I won't lie and say it's easy and I definitely agree- addiction sucks. But being sober gets easier the more you practice I found. 
Dad here a dad who got through an amazing amount of pick-ups on altoids and avoiding people. I tried to cut back for several years until the day I screwed up my infant son's medications. I am grateful every day that I did not lose injure or kill my children...Getting sober sucks. It's hard. REALLY hard. Really painful. Really humiliating humbling...horrible at times. It's really worth it.  REALLY worth it. It takes time and work but you will become a much better mom partner student *person.*
Welcome. You are in the right place. I went to AA to get help and it has helped me maintain sobriety.  You have a lot on your plate right now and I can imagine getting all the support will help you through this time and there are lot of people here willing to help by listening. ..You were honest in your post and that's a great place to start honesty. 
I'm so glad you posted...It feels like you **do know** how to be strong enough -- from what you shared you're taking action and asking for help and *that* is strength right there...I'm a mother of two young children and there is no better feeling in the world than bed time stories and cuddles without worrying about alcohol on my breath.  It was hard work to remove alcohol from my equation especially in those first days and weeks -- not drinking/drinking was just about all I could think about.  I read SD all day every day made the daily check-in my part of my morning ritual clung to /u/coolcrosby's Baby Steps and cried a lot...What I find now is that feelings sorrow and anxiety have diminished dramatically as I don't have to contend with the awful affects of alcohol (or caffeine -- which I stopped consuming nearly 3 months ago). I am **finally** feeding the good instead of digging myself out of the hole...You can do this too ladynavaris.  Not taking that next drink is the single most important action that will change your life.  It's changed mine profoundly and I have the good folks of SD to thank for that...I hope to see lots of posts from you in the future.  I wish you kindness and self-compassion..
Hi ladynavaris I'm a stay at home dad and until a year ago a sufferer of chronic pain as well as anxiety and depression. Since quitting I've found my mental health has undergone a huge improvement initially i think just due to removing alcohol from the equation but latterly because I've learned some coping strategies and have actually stuck with them for once. Have you looked into mindfulness? It's been a huge help for me. I feel I have the ability to be calm and honest about concerns which stops them spiralling into that awful shaky fug of fear and woe. It's been a revelation...My pain condition has eventually cleared up but when it was hot I was taking up to 180mgs of morphine a day and I think it fed my mental health issues and gave me a great excuse to drink. Do you have access to a pain management team? I know a few people who have had huge support in coping with their chronic pain by accessing them...Stopping drinking *is* scary but once you've done it you look back and it doesn't seem as bad. I'd suggest doing whatever you have to whether that's AA or a rehab or whatever just to break the back of it and remember you can change strategies at any time so even if AA doesn't appeal you tell yourself it can be temporary. The main thing is to grab some sober time. Then reassess. ..Giving up caffeine helped me too. And smoking. In fact a doctor told me that caffeine nicotine and alcohol together have a huge detrimental effect on recovery from pretty much every physical and mental condition. I'm not saying he's right but it's worth a shot eh? Take care do the next right thing and keep posting. All the best.
Hi Ladynavaris I thought I'd add my two cents since I'm also a mum with young kids and I'm early in recovery. The turning point for me was having to take my daughter to her first day of school still drunk from the night before. I realised enough was enough. ..Stopping drinking has been the best decision I've ever made. Some days are easy others are not. The depression and anxiety are still there the kids still stress me out; but it's all so much easier to manage without the booze. I'm a happier and healthier person already a better mother and wife. Life is more enjoyable. ..You can do this. You won't regret it. Just take one day at a time. ..Lots of luck. 
Everyone has already given such great advice. Just wanted to add my voice to the chorus of moms with littles at home. I cannot tell you how much easier parenting has become since I stopped drinking. My anxiety is quieting down and my patience level for my children is so much higher. I promise you will find a better mom and a better YOU inside sobriety. So glad you found this sub keep posting!

I can relate so much to your last paragraph. Everything made me want to drink. Good days called for a celebratory drink and on bad days I had to drink the pain away. But there is light at the end of that tunnel...The SAME day I got out of rehab I was 90 days sober. I was now on my own and I had just gotten a new job: it was my first day. I was in a new city trying to navigate the bus routes and I just couldn't figure out how to get where I had to go. So I start walking and I am already late. There ahead of me is a liquor store and the feeling of needing a drink came over me. I stumbled past that store full of poison I used to drown in and made it to work that day and the next. ..The point of this is to help you understand that this is entirely possible. I promise you the longer you stay sober that feeling will not be so overwhelming. Sure the thought of taking a drink does enter my mind but with each day that passes that feeling is not quite as strong. When you deal with your problems whatever they may be without taking a drink you become stronger and eventually you will think of how to handle it rather than running to get a drink. Sobriety IS possible for all of us no matter how hopeless we feel in the beginning. I am rooting for you and check back in with all your friends here :)
