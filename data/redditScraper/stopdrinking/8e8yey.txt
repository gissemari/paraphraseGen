Drinking not drinking drinking not drinking.....I can't seem to get control over this habit. I'm constantly relapsing and have never been sober for much over 4 months...Why do I keep doing this to myself  
----------immediate responses--------

That's the nature of addiction......My first step was to speak to my doctor about my drinking and intention to stop.....The book/YouTube Channel '*This Naked Mind*' and the book '*Alcohol Explained*' really helped me understand my drinking problem and gave me some useful tools to stop and *stay* stopped without feeling like I was depriving myself or missing anything.....Together with the support of this sub it's been a winning combo.....The cycle of drinking and feeling awful about it is a horrible one to be stuck in but you *can* break free with the right knowledge tools and support... For me the only 'control' is not to drink at all not even 'Just One'......I also found it necessary to work on the underlying issues which were causing me to drink and I practice daily vigilance and try to help other addicts in order to *stay* stopped... it seems to be doing the trick so far!..Hope that helps ..I won't drink with you today..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Hang in there friend. I'm in the same boat.  I only wish I could string 4 months together so in my book you're doing well.  I just remember that no sober time is ever wasted and the more days I go without the better off I am.  Eventually we get the tools and insight we need to keep at it and make it stick.  I'm sure of it
