I set a goal of 30 days.  No excuses not one beer one glass of wine nothing.  ..I am 9 days in and the changes are amazing.  My patience being the biggest.  I'm having a blast with my children.  I got our master bedroom painted and trimmed out (saw was in bedroom for 5 months...)   Just an overall productive healthy weekend. ..When I reach my goal of 30 days I will set another goal and another after that.  I'm tired of relapsing and binging the night away.

Great job! I just finished my 1st week and finally built my headboard for my master bedroom. Amazing productivity! Congratulations. It feels good doesn't it? 
Upwards and onwards my friend :)

Awesome job. It will only get better. IWNDWYT. 
Congrats.  I'm not quite to the week point but I feel the best I've felt in 30 years.  IWNDWYT
I also started out with a 30 day goal.  Somewhere along the way I realized that I liked living this way that I was actually enjoying my life.  I finally figured out that sobriety is something to treasure not just suffer through.  Congrats on 9 days!
Congratulations. I also started with a 30 day challenge to myself and kept moving out the goal posts. I found that it really does get better and easier.  
Hey man that's amazing.  I just started my one week challenge. Starting today. 
Made it to day 11!  Thanks for all the support!  
Still going strong.  Made it through the weekend and some stressful times.  Got back out in the bicycle today as well.   Exercise  is so important for me during hard times.  Thank you for all the support!   .IWNDWYT!!!
