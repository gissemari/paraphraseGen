Ive been struggling a bit lately with falling back into old habits. But have gone 6 days with no drinking after slipping up.  Today a guy called in sick to work so I ended up having to work 4 hrs overtime. I decided after much inner fighting I deserved a beer or two after such a long day. And I would stop on my way home and grab a couple of tall boys. But when I got to the beer store... My god damn car door wouldn't open!? Tried the passenger side. Same deal! I was literally locked in my car! No amount of body checks had any effect. It's cold here today and my car sucks so the latching system must have been frozen or stuck some how. I had no choice to abort the beer mission.. I got home put the car in park and low and behold the doors opened right up!

I'd definitely take that as a sign!  Glad to not be drinking with you today.
Your car is totally looking out for you :)
That's a Knightrider-level win right there.
Jesus was drivin' your hotrod! Glad to hear you got a little help in sticking with sobriety.
Dukes of Hazzard alcohol edition.
That's a real "higher power"
WOW! O_o
Higher power man higher power. Congrats on not drinking and making it through another day. I won't drink with you today. 
Haha that is awesome.  
I'm imagining your car talking in HALs voice "I'm sorry orange1690 I can't let you do that.".
