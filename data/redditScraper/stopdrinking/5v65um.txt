Hey man you'll feel alot better once the booze is all out of your system then its back on track! 
I hated starting over-even a few days drinking gives me a whole new withdrawal experience. So that made it worth it to finally stay sober. Good wishes.
This will pass someday quicker than you think. Good luck with that rehab. 
just remember you don't have to go through day three again..hang in there.
