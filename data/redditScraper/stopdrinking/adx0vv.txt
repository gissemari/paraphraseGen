  ..365 days. 52 weekends. 12 calendar pages. 1 spin around the sun. 0 drinks...I found r/stopdrinking a couple days after I finally admitted to myself that the swelling pain under my ribs was moving from intermittent to constant and that it was most likely connected to the increasingly high liver enzymes my last two years of blood tests found. All of this I finally conceded was a result of my progressive daily drinking. My marriage was strained by my Dr. 1eightone8 and Mr. Asshole routine. My mornings were getting rougher and rougher.  My digestion was weakening and I was underweight.  ..I stopped drinking (again right?)...Those early days were rough. I recognized I was poisoning myself but in my muddled state I didn't know what to do about that.  I knew I needed to stop filling my emptiness with alcohol but I didn't know what to replace it with. And it was everywhere. I worked in a homebrew shop I brewed on the weekends I chose my nights out based on the drink menus. I was in deep. ..I started by just filling up the time and emptiness with coffee and sparkling water and a desperate mustering of willpower. I drank soooooo much coffee - which did not help my insomnia that first month - but it was a struggle between needing to be sipping on  something with a bite' all day and desperately needing to sleep to heal.  But at least I wasn't sneaking vodka for breakfast anymore.  Now I was eating an entire bar of 92% dark chocolate at night instead of drinking myself to sleep. When my co-workers were sharing beers behind the counter I read a few posts here. .. Alcohol Explained' and  This Naked Mind' were like finding a map when I was lost in the jungle. I still had to work my way out but I had context and direction...In those early weeks I took long walks when the cravings hit. I spent many sleepless nights engaging with this forum - learning from the pain and success of others. I am not one for groups and have otherwise made this journey mostly on my own. My wife has been supportive since I told her in the second week. The few close friends and family members I have told approve but don't have much to say other than offering general support which is fine because most of them drink a decent amount. I didn't talk much about it to my coworkers until they asked directly and I kept it vague about needing to take some time away from drinking or  having drank my fill' or simply 'I don't drink.'..I journaled my early days and weeks in posts here because it helped me unwind the old neural pathways process the fundamental change in my thinking about drinking and mythologize the psychological process in a way that as I look back I think Jung would approve. I commented on others' challenges which were so often similar to mine because this had become my support group. ..From all this I fashioned my own tools. My approach to breaking my drinking habit has been crude and cobbled-together. I became a social hermit and gave myself some mental space to revamp my routine. Hot baths for natural de-stressing.  Instead of pouring out all my homebrewed beers I gave some away. The rest I dumped a bottle at a time from my closet whenever the cravings were really loud because I was taking my life back.  There was a night I was closing the shop up alone and sweeping up hop pellets and mopping the sticky malty floor and cleaning the beer residue out of so many glasses and dumping out half-warm leftovers that had been shared around - it was like the Talking Heads sing "I'm cleaning/cleaning my brain!"..&amp;#x200B;..I set an early soft goal of \~ 2 months in turning 40 years old without drinking. I went over the hill on my terms. Sometimes the weeks flew by sometimes the hours stretched but I took each day one at a time.  My self-confidence grew and my lifelong depressive tendencies have shrunk significantly as my brain chemistry rights itself.  I finally got back into exercise the last couple months and am healthier than I was 10 years ago.  I've learned how to live in a society that drinks without partaking.  I am slowly but surely moving beyond alcohol.  I am better off without it. ..I can kiss my wife in the evening without worrying about the ethanol metabolized in my lungs wafting out with my breath. ..Thanks for the help SD. I will not drink with you today!
