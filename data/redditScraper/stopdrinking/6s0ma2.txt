Feeling down and messy this weekend. I went to treatment back in Feb/March. Stayed sober for a few months and it was great. And then no excuses stopped using my resources and support system and relapsed. I'm thankfully not as bad as when I got treatment but I'm starting to feel like I could be there again soon...I'm in between jobs so I have way too much time on my hands. I should probably go to school but I have no idea what for. Married to an alcoholic who's not interested in keeping the house alcohol free. I should probably leave him just for that but it's been so long since I've been on my own so idk...I feel ashamed that I'm here again and admitting it is difficult...Just kinda venting. Feel like a mess today. Thanks for reading.

Nothing changes if nothing changes. What tangible actions are you going to take to remain sober?
Hope things improve!..I finally realized that it wasn't *lack of willpower* as my issue but rather *Lack of In Real Life Support*.  That's all I needed!..I went to meetings and immediately found people who understood what I was experiencing.  I got tools resources support and fellowship to first stop drinking and then to live sober...Now I just forgo ONE drink today - The First One..Never been happier!
One step at a time.  Hey it's great that you were sober for several months so you know you can do it.  How about getting serious about your game plan?  It can change as you go and get more information.  I won't drink with you today.
Ditto all of this. Vent away. Then move your ass. Do anything. Try anything. Then rest a bit and see how you feel. You are the only one who has to look yourself in the eyes every day. I'm starting to look into mirrors again and I really hope that you can too.
