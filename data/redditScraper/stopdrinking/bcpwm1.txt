Getting it off my chest. I had a great 10 day run recently and yesterday I was blackout drunk most of the day. This was a bad binge enough that I'm back in withdrawals- so there might have to be some tapering today but hoping not. The cruel irony is that I wish I could sleep through it but the insomnia from alcohol is so strong. ...I feel like it's close to costing me both my job and relationship. I've been very good at hiding it but there's no way that people don't suspect something. I'm exhausted. I'm tired of feeling so paranoid and anxious all of the time. It's like soon this big bubble is going to burst and everyone is going to know. And there's a small piece of me that actually wants to push that bubble because when I'm really down I don't feel like I deserve the good things I have when I've put alcohol before everything. ..I went to an AA meeting last night and it helped I just broke down a few times. I like going but I'm so young compared to everyone else there. The social pressure of it can be a bit much to handle sometimes but I'm going to be more of a presence there as I get more serious about my sobriety...I also learned yesterday that my cousin died of alcoholism this week. I never knew she struggled. I don't think any of us did. I'm grateful that her family isn't hiding her cause of death from anyone. They're sad but relieved because her addiction was such a burden on everyone around her. I never want to do that to the people I love.

Yours is a very heartfelt post. I think many of us can relate. I'm actually happy that you are so young. Life is going to throw you many obstacles including the one you're in.  Defeat this obstacle and you will be stronger and stronger for whatever lies ahead. Please don't get me wrong life is joyous and happy and good. Yet there are always ups and downs to navigate. ..There is an old Dan Fogelberg song the lyrics are:." Lessons learned are like bridges burned you only need to cross them once. .Is the knowledge gained worth the price of the pain?  Are the spoils worth the cost of the hunt?"..I often think of these lyrics. If we don't learn the lesson that life is teaching us we will keep relearning it and relearning it until we get it right. The second part of this song... "are the spoils worth the cost of the hunt?"  is so applicable to all of us who do not want to drink.  .. Keep posting here.  I've found an app in the Play Store called  "I am Sober" which is immensely helpful.   It is easy to use keeps me accountable motivates me and makes me feel good.  You may want to add that to what supports you.  ..Good luck today and always.
I'm glad you are back- so sorry to hear about your cousin. It is mystifying how we can risk our friends our jobs our sanity and even our lives for something that makes us feel like shit half the time! If you keep checking out various meetings you might find one that feels like a better fit for you. Good luck!
