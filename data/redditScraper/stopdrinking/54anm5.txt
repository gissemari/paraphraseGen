Third badge reset. ..I think I'm finally doing this for the right reasons and those reasons are ME and MY HEALTH. ..I am a classic binge drinker. Outside of maybe work functions I cannot stop myself from having another and not stopping until I am blacked out and passed out. I drink by myself 4-5 nights a week. A liter of wine is consumed in most sessions if not more. I go to work groggy and let's face it probably still drunk. It's a wonder I've made it as far as I have. I guess I'm a 'functioning' alcoholic whatever that means. I remind myself how good it feels to go into work after NOT having drank the night before but I guess I don't care. ..I have heart palpitations my blood pressure (at 29!) is through the roof. I sweat like crazy when no one else is sweating. I'm clinically obese. I'm SICK and TIRED of being sick and tired. ..My boyfriend has been my support through all of this. He is the only one that knows the extent of my drinking. I also struggle with mental illness that is exacerbated by my drinking. He told me the other day "I start to think I'm doing something wrong and you are not happy with ME when I get home from work and you are already wasted." I cried. I cannot lose him. I cannot make him feel that way. ..When I binge drink I binge eat. Anything I can get my hands on. I often wish I was one of those people that 'forgot' to eat while drunk. I shudder at the thought of the creation of 'calorie free' alcohol. It would be a free for all. ..It has not even been three days. I haven't noticed heart palpitations in at least a day. My sweating is slowly starting to subside. I just hopped on the scale and laughed; I'm down six pounds since Thursday. ..I have to do this for me and my health and for nothing else. I'll be visiting frequently!
