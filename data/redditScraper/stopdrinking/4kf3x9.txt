can you stop today?
I'm glad you're scared. That's a good sign. It was only when I felt scared and desperate that I sincerely reached out for help and was willing to do whatever it took to get well. 
Sorry to hear about this.  I spent about 3 hours this week just thinking about wine and beer. Had a rough week  I hope that you jump right back on the wagon  and remember this post.  I will not drink with you today.

In the two years before I permanently quit I had streaks of over 60 days and over 45 days and thought I could drink and easily stop again.  I was wrong each time and each time led me to months and months of misery and struggle.  I had to do whatever it took to stop no matter what...Do you have a plan?  How did you stop for 61 days?
I made 84 first time around then I thought I could moderate...There was an inevitability about me failing. I had to fail to know that I couldn't go back...The next best action for you is to start again. I did and I think I'm doing okay.
I went 157 days and blew it this week called into work twice because I was so hungover then started feeling better and went out again. So I'm faced with this difficult turn of events I hate myself for it but I hate I have let my family down which they probably already found out Because I confided in my sister about it last night drunk. I will join you today in trying to remain strong as I we work past this awful turn of events.
