If there ever was a weekend where I would fail it would have been this past weekend! As I posted Friday I was home alone Friday evening and that is a HUGE trigger for me. I made it through the evening :) Saturday comes along and we drop off my little yorkie for a hair cut....we get home and the house it all smokey in the kitchen....WHAT? I find our youngest son (who is 18) to make sure everything was ok...Like he didn't catch the house on fire...no he's just smoking e-cigs....what?? He saw my struggle quitting smoking! He's old enough to decide to do that on his own but I would prefer it not be in my house. Go along with our day.....I am cleaning up after dinner and I let out dogs out to go to the bathroom. After a couple minutes I go out to let them back in.....my 6 lb yorkie found a hole in the fence and was gone! It's snowing!! My husband and I spent 15-20 minutes looking for him when he finally came running back to the house! I was a mess!! Go to bed.....get up Sunday. Hubby isn't feeling well. I am in the kitchen cooking and he comes in and has me look at his back.....he has SHINGLES!! He is on a medicine for his IBD and UC that suppresses his immune system. The one thing they didn't make him get a vaccine for before starting the medicine :( Well at least I didn't drink! IWNDWYT

You were tested and passed!  I was worried you were going to say your Yorkie fell INTO a hole!  So happy that he came back.  I hope the weekend coming up is more peaceful :)  IWNDWYT

You did amazing friend! Congrats!
