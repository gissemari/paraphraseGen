----------immediate responses--------

I think of the consequences. Like what will actually happen. I'll prob fight with wife I'll feel like shit I'll risk not showing up to work. That usually helps. Idk I'm bad at this...If there's no consequences.... I don't want to promote drinking... but it's your life man
