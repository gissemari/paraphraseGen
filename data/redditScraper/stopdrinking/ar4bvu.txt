First off I want to say that I in no way blame others for not picking up on my deadly internal struggle they too have lives and I'm NOT their responsibility.  The daily war inside my head is one that I've won now for 268 days and to those who don't know better it likely seems like I've exercised the alcohol demons but I'm nowhere close to it.  If I were to relapse it would be due to getting slowly worn down like waves on a beach eroding my determination one wave at a time.  I've tried to be sober before and when I failed it appeared to outsiders like perhaps I wasn't even trying and that hurts because I know what the experience was like to fail.  Again though we shouldn't ever harbor resentment towards those around us they have demons of their own too.  Be there for each other and know when they want to be alone.  At the end of the day no amount of money will truly define you how you treat others and this planet will.  Be safe strangers you're not alone. =)

I go to meetings when I really need support. They are a great place to gain wisdom and fellowship from others who know the struggle.
I know that feeling. Like you're invisible but somehow still playing your part. I resented those close to me for not noticing that i was hurting but I couldn't ask for help. I hear you and I see you... you aren't completely alone friend. I'm glad you shared. 
You can't really blame them for not being able to truly understand. It's alright we understand.
