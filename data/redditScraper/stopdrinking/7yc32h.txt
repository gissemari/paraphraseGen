Title says it all. Just turned 28 have been sober for close to a year and a half and the emotion that I struggle with most in loneliness...Besides AA how have you found other like-minded individuals?

32 and lonely ... hm but i don't think it has much to do with drinking or not. i was even lonelier when i drank?
Volunteer organizations involving something I'm passionate about i.e. social services animal shelter arts etc.
Meetup is a great website too.  I think it depends on the area but sometimes have some cool events to get to. 
For me I have been learning about different energy work and similar topics. When I go to groups it seems no on drinks 
I go to meetup groups for things that I have in common with people..I go to one in particular its a men's meetup group about a book on how to be a better man..I'm a year younger than you so I feel you..I feel lonely to. I haven't made real friends yet 
Outdoor group actvities in my case sailing in my case. Scubavdiving bicycle riding hiking. There's abunch of people doing tons of stuff!
