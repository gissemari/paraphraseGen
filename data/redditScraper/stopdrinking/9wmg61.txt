Hello everyone!..So before I begin I just wanted to say that I know this is gonna be a bit of a wall of text. I find writing things out to be therapeutic and a big part of the reason that I am writing this is that I want to strengthen my commitment to sobriety. Part of me didn't even want to post it because I don't feel like I am really contributing anything to the community but then I started thinking that if even one person reads this and feels inspired it will be worth it to me...Anyway I'm in a great mood right now because today marks a week of sobriety. I know that many people on this sub have been sober way longer (months years even decades) but a week is still a big accomplishment for me because I used to drink nightly. And not only was I binge drinking on a daily basis but a lot of this drinking happened when I was alone. I was using alcohol as an escape but there's irony in that because the chronic drinking was preventing from aspiring to anything and forcing me to stay exactly where I was. The escape being provided to me was illusory while in reality my life was completely stagnant...This isn't the first time that I've tried to quit drinking this year. I was sober for pretty much the entirety of June and July but I decided to  reward' myself by allowing myself to drink with some friends one night and surprise I slid back into nightly drinking. It took me three months to muster up the commitment necessary to try again...I think the reason that I slid back into binge drinking is that I hadn't learned one very important lesson: Sobriety is its own reward. I wanted to take a moment to reflect on what being sober has meant for me over the last week:..- When I don't spend the first half of my day hungover I have the time to grocery shop and cook. I used to eat out almost daily and it was not only expensive but also very unhealthy. Today is the first day that I've purchased fast food and it was as a celebration of the one week mark. And tomorrow I will be back to cooking...- On the note of health I realized that the only reason I was a smoker was that I was a drunk. After a day or two into quitting drinking I realized that without beer/wine to lower my inhibitions quitting smoking is something I was capable of doing. Right now I'm at five days since my last cigarette...- I decided to clean up and organize my living space. I used to be embarrassed to bring people to my apartment. Not only were there a shit ton of empties but I just didn't have the drive to truly clean it. It wasn't disgusting but it wasn't a place that I could be proud of. Now looking around my apartment I feel that this is a place I'd be happy to show off as my home...- Despite getting less sleep I feel like I have more energy. This one is kinda a mixed bag because I have been experiencing some insomnia over the last week and I'm not going to gloss over how frustrating that has been. But even with insomnia I find myself waking up with more energy. I assume it's because my body isn't going into overdrive while I'm asleep trying to eliminate the poison I just introduced into my system. I know that eventually the insomnia is going to pass and I will be feeling the full benefits of my sleep cycles...- On the note of sleep I've started to remember my dreams again. Ok this one is weird and I'm really not sure whether it's because I stopped drinking or if it's because I stopped smoking pot but I used to never remember my dreams when I woke up in the morning. I have to assume it's because I was going to bed intoxicated because now that I've embraced sobriety again I'm starting to remember them...- I feel motivated. Turns out when I'm not drunk or stoned every night I don't find it acceptable to spend an entire day playing video games watching Netflix and accomplishing nothing at all. Today I had the day off and usually this would have been spent getting high playing video games during the day and either going to a bar at night or getting wasted by myself. Instead I used the opportunity to paint and redecorate my bathroom (which I was able to justify financially because I hadn't spent money on booze smokes weed or fast food for the entire week). I now LOVE how the bathroom looks...- My anxiety is decreasing. At one point this week I decided to sit down with my boss and talk about how I could potentially grow and develop within my workplace. I didn't get the exact answer that I was looking for but it still went pretty decently and I feel like the conversation helped me with setting goals for how I could improve. My boss has no clue how much I struggled with alcohol but she did mention that she's noticed I've been coming to work in a better mood recently and with more energy. The biggest reason this was an accomplishment for me is that I am usually too afraid of rejection to put myself out there in the first place. But deciding not to drink has made me feel more confident and accomplished and I decided to step outside of my comfort zone and go for what I want...- Most importantly I feel like a functional person again. This one's hard to explain but for the last little while I felt like a shell of myself. I felt like I had already peaked earlier in my life and I just didn't believe I was capable of achieving my hopes and dreams anymore - in fact I'm not even sure I had hopes and dreams. But stopping drinking and taking a more proactive approach towards self-improvement really has left me feeling like I did when I was young and before I let myself waste so much of my time boozing. It feels great and I wouldn't trade it for anything...So for me sobriety really has been its own reward. Its improved so many aspects of my life. It hasn't solved all of life's problems but I truly believe I am becoming a better person because I am making this decision...I hope this post didn't come across as bragging. I made it because I wanted to be able to look back on it in the future when my resolve is weaker than it is now but also because I think that there are so many benefits to sobriety that people take for granted...Thanks so much guys for being such a loving and supportive group. I truly think that if it wasn't for this subreddit I'd be wasted right now and throwing up tomorrow morning. But as it stands I have a fun day of Dungeons and Dragons ahead of me and I know that I'm going to be feeling just fine when I wake up in the morning. ..IWNDWYT.

Besides not knowing what Dungeons and Dragons is everything else you have written here is like I wrote it myself. Every point. Also you have major right to brag by the way! Congratulations and well done you! I am so happy for you and wish you all the best for the rest of this amazing journey. Thank you so much for sharing. Now back to cleaning and organizing my home :-) Happy and grateful to say I will not be drinking with you today.
I am so glad you shared. I could read this everyday as a reminder of why not to drink. Keep up the good work. IWNDWYT :)
