I went away for a friend's wedding and drank way too much. Feeling terrible today like this pattern will never end embarrassed and ashamed. Could use some advice about how to work through this

It's going to take more than some advice from Reddit. If you're serious about quitting drinking go to AA meetings get a sponsor and work the steps
Not to turn this into a debate but there are other options than AA though it is a great one. There are a list of resources on this sub. But you have to do something....be it A.A. Smart Recovery talk to your doctor talk to a therapist....something. So do some reading and researching and find out what you path to sobriety will look like. And if you slip get back up dust yourself off and try again. IWNDWYT 
Advice FROM a relapser: reflect on what went wrong what led you to that first drink what behaviors/thoughts/actions could you have changed and then put a plan in place. The only way I haven't let the relapses defeat me is by learning from them. I'm now actively working the AA program going to therapy meditating and most importantly putting my sobriety first. It took quite a few relapses for me to understand that's what I needed and it's been tough learning that but I'm grateful for the lessons. You can do it!!!
Like mentioned try to think logically about why you took the drink according to your excuses and also why you truly did. It helps me to talk to someone else who knows me well or is also an alcoholic about the incident because if I don't my brain will continue to trick itself and not get the whole picture. Then it's hard for me to avoid it next time it happens. Most importantly don't beat yourself up. You're doing great by keeping sober and posting for help when a slip happens. Be kind to yourself you've come so far already!
