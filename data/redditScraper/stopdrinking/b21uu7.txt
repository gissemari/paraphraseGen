Hello friends I'm 26m and really want to cut alcohol out of my life but am still in that phase of not truly being committed to that decision...Here's a brief history of my history with alcohol and other substances:..I didn't get drunk for the first time until I was 18 - a few months before graduating high school. The reason for drinking? Heartache. I chugged nearly an entire 750mL of Barcardi and blacked out. ..So the fact that I A) drank while emotional and B) got drunk sets the pace for my relationship with alcohol...I only drank - got hammered rather - a few other times between then and turning 21 in 2013. ..When I was 20 I smoked weed for the first time got a medical card in California and became a daily smoker. I never got too crazy in one sitting though and usually just smoked at night. And to be honest it helped *a lot* overcoming some anxiety problems and an eating disorder. I also attribute weed to not really being interested in drinking...Not until 2015 did I have any problems with alcohol. From March-May I would get drunk 2-3 times per week chilling at home out of boredom mainly. ..End of 2015 I got into dancing and trance/techno drank more often - but at least went out and socialized - and then my interested turned towards MDMA...Life changing and incredible I won't bash it. Of course I had a honeymoon phase and had a terrible comedown. Learned my lesson and was responsible with that stuff thereafter...I got into a relationship in 2016 and we drank but it was moderate. ..Didn't have a problem with any substances again until I found out he was cheating on me summer of 2017. Began getting shitfaced nearly every night. Wasn't smoking weed in 2017 I should mention. ..October 2017 I was still drinking but also began smoking cigarettes. A friend sold Xanax to me too and I was taking those in the afternoon and evening (with alcohol). I should have died...My friend saw what was happening to me around Thanksgiving and told me he didn't have a connect anymore - which was a lie he was really just trying to save my life. ..Continued drinking albeit I cut it down quite a bit and smoking...In March 2018 another friend started connecting me with Adderall and Vyvanse. This was amazing...Took it often through September then daily. I also switched from cigs to vaping at this time...After I started taking Adderall daily I completely lost interest in alcohol and didn't drink at all from September 2018 until last weekend...Part of it was the stimulant and another part of it was realizing I really don't really like how I feel when drinking. Not being in control. Not being able to think clearly and make sound judgements. Not being able to "go somewhere" due not not being able to drive. Sleeping like crap. Feeling groggy the next day. Getting random headaches half the time within an hour of drinking even though it was only one drink and I was hydrated...So a week ago was my last day taking Adderall. Not my choice I just don't have a connect anymore. Which is probably the best thing to happen because I have been a cracked out moron for the past 6 months...The withdrawal wasn't as bad as I thought and I feel great now to be honest. ..I have been struggling however with committing to not drinking. ..All those negative things I attributed to drinking are true. Other than feeling a good for a bit having fun and being social - it doesn't benefit me in any way. Financially even. ..Despite knowing this I still feel bad missing out on going for drinks with friends or a date. ..I should mention I still vape but am trying to cut back. And I smoke weed but I don't consider this to be a problem. It really helps me calm down and "chill the f out" when I'm feeling anxious allows me to sort through my thoughts slowly. ..How did you get yourself to the point of committing? Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? ..Like part of me is "Yeah lots go grab a drink tomorrow!" But another part of me is saying "But I *really* honestly don't *want* to drink... rather stay sober." .

I personally quit drinking by starting to smoke weed on a regular basis. It helped my anxiety and depression out a lot. I've been drinking since 15 to ease pain of child abuse. I personally want to quit forever. I'm 34 and have been sober for about 9 months a couple of times before. Now since November I've been sober. I don't like the after effects of alcohol. I wasn't myself when I was drunk. I was an idiot when drunk. I embarrassed myself and my husband. ... Quitting can be tough expectantly in your 20's. I'd suggest always having a cup in your hands if you are around alcohol. It's easier to refuse a drink when you already have one even if it's just soda. ... Also you cannot overdose on weed so I don't personally see an issue with that as long as  you can keep up with your daily life. But I personally I don't like nicotine in any form. ... Sounds like you may want to seek professional help about the anxiety and depression if the weed doesn't cure it all. ... Good Luck! IWNDWYT or tomorrow! :)
