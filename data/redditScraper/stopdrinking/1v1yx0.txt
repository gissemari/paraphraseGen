My husband did the bills this morning and informed me that we have to conform to a strict budget for the next few weeks. We had to pay the propane bill and my medical supplies bill which leaves little money for the next two weeks. .I am happy. It takes the choice of drinking away from me. I've been sober for a few weeks and I've only really struggled once on Friday. I was really wanting to buy some beer. ButI stuck to it and the craving passed. Now at least for these two weeks it is just not an option.

Soon enough if you stay on course drinking will just never be an option. I think it's a good idea to immerse ourselves in recovery support programs particularly at the beginning of sobriety. We have the opportunity to learn a lot about "problem" drinking. Or as I call it "alcoholism". Welcome to recovery.
Drinking is always an option-- there were plenty of times I charged a whole night of sinking on a credit card I had no way of paying off. The longer I stay sober the less willing I am to consider that option of drinking. Today it's not one I'm willing to seriously consider AT ALL. I don't drink no matter what. Sounds like it's becoming something you're less and less willing to consider too!
