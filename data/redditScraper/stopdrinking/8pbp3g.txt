Sugar works for me. Fruit doughnuts dark chocolate whatever it takes. I know I had times it was moment-to-moment choices not to drink.
Eating an overfilling amount of food followed by chocolate always helps me get through the cravings. I'm a believer that the body often conflates hunger and thirst with wanting alcohol. It gets easier. Best of luck. IWNDWYT.
Keep fighting lovely. You are doing so well.  Post as much as you need to in order to keep you from drinking. IWNDWYT 
Keep going...I promise I rode the worst crave the other day ...I honestly thought I was going to loose it...I posted here...walked the dog...ate some chocolate and returned to re-engage in a work related meeting.  The craving stayed longer than expected (it was waiting me out) but once it was gone it didn't return for the rest of the evening.  Because I made it my next craving (yesterday night) didn't last as long ....and I knew it would go away because I finally gave myself the experience of getting through a really uncomfortable experience successfully...we've got to build on a few wins to get our momentum going.  Hang on...You've got us all cheering for you!
