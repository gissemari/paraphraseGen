Well the past few weeks have been interesting...Long story short I turned into a massive drunk back in 2011-2012 which culminated in dropping out of university having to move back home getting fired from an (admittedly horrible) job at UPS and eventually getting intervened on after stealing a couple of Tramadol meant for one of my parents' dogs. Incidentally don't mix those two I still have no idea how I didn't wind up having a straight-up seizure...After almost dying in front of my mom on a cold January day I stopped barring a couple of relatively controlled relapses. Except it's all coming back pretty hardcore especially over the past couple of months where a combination of stress some mental issues that are only partially masked by Celexa and being on my own again have thrown it right back into 12-pack-of-Natty-Ice or a fifth of vodka a night territory mixed up with managing to fail most of my classes (again) and probably being in a situation where I'll have no choice to move back home (again) and if this carries on probably having a seizure...From what little I remember about Sunday it involved most of a handle (and I weigh 140 pounds and am on a medication that amplifies booze) and blowing up horribly on a good friend of mine...Also underlying depression and some serious gender dysphoria which I'm finally finally starting to face instead of running away from. And I'm a sneaky drunk which has really kept me from like talking to people about it...The last couple of nights I've finally started coming out to a few close friends both as a woman and as a drunk and strangely enough it's refreshing. Hell I have half a pint of crappy vodka here because I was worried about horrifying withdrawal stuff but so far they seem to be holding off besides the insomnia and moderate nausea and generally feeling kind of shaky and crappy...and I don't want to drink it...Things might be looking up.

It sounds like there's a lot of issues that you could use some help with. In my experience drinking isn't really a problem as much as it is a solution to deal with things we are unsure on how to handle. Therefore if you are able to find another more permanent solution to some of the other problems you have you may be able to seriously decrease or remove that need and obsession to drink. It sounds like as you've been able to talk to others about your situation it's already begun to happen a little...I'm not a doctor but I can offer you some very general advice that helped me with my mental illness (alcoholism). It seemed that the biggest way I was able to make progress and develop the tools to deal with my alcoholism was finding people that had been through some of the same stuff could relate with how I felt and had already found a solution. I imagine that you may find you have a lot of room to grow if you can find people that can not only relate with how much you drink but any other issues you feel that you also have. I would make it your goal to have the next step in your life be gathering a myriad of support systems for each individual issue you think affects your daily life and work from there. ..It gets better if you take the actions to make it better. It will get worse if you neglect to take the actions to make it better. We're all with you in that we think quitting drinking will be an enormous advantage to you going forward. Good luck friend.
Welcome.  As a former sneaky drunk with a "secret" life I can identify.  ..For me there was a huge  transition required from the shadows the avoidance the evasion to a truthful well lit existence...**I was so good at lying to myself - and usually so drunk/high I believed it.**..This is why I could not do it alone.   ..MY path included AA ( yeah I know)   there are others now and I don't know that it matters so long as you surround your self with caring people who have been through this before and who are able to help puncture your lies before they blow up into blimps which take you back to never-never land.
