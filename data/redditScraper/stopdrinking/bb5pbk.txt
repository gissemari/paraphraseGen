Hey all....So I drank a bottle of scotch took oxycodone abd valium and ibuprofen. I have a back injury which was the reason for pain killers. But I drink due to depression and physical health issues. ..I didn't even feel that bad taking all that stuff together. Not compared to my usual every day sick self. I have no hangover today that I can determine - nothing beyond my usual fatigue and dizziness that's caused by other issues..But I decided that I better stop drinking. I'm gaining a lot of weight from it destroying my liver creating so much oxidative damage and inflammation that will lead to cancer. I'm depressed so I don't have huge hope for the future but I know I have zero shot of improving my health to any degree if I keep drinking like that. And I want to feel less dizziness/vertigo less fatigue less hot and sweaty less depressed and anxious... so I decided not to buy a bottle today. I didn't even buy cigarettes. I'm struggling with smoking moreso at the moment. ..I don't want to drink a drop until we go on a short 2 night holiday next month. Not saying I plan to drink but my short term goal is to reach that point next month. ..IWNDWYT
