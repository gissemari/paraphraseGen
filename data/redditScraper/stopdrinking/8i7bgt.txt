This is my first post on reddit.  ..I was 25 days sober. (Longest in 5 years).No problem with walking past the beer/wine section at the grocery store. No problem in gas stations with booze shots right next to the cash register. Restaurants no problem. ..Until a client I was working for showed up on site yesterday to clean. We've done a substantial amount of work for them the past few weeks. ..I knew he was an alcoholic because we threw away a ton of empty beer cans as we went about our work. ..I was alone loading a trailer and he pulled in. .He got out and took 1-2-3-4567 steps back and fell flat on his back. He's quite an old guy so I rush over and try to help. ..He's got a semi full pack of beer on the passenger floor boards and he reeks of beer. Blaming it on his knee  it gives out  and swearing the whole time. .After fifteen minutes he finally lets me pick him up and get him to lean on the car. He said something to the effect of  my wife is going to kill me  and is clearly embarrassed. He leaves and I go about my business. ..The weird part. I've never been a drink until you fall guy. But a few shot before/at work to make it through guy. ..I couldn't shake the idea of getting a drink and went to the Kroger liquor department and made my purchase. ..I'm just confused at this point and will be joining you folks again in this goofy fight against booze.

Welcome aboard!..Yep that's a weird one you're right!..Sounds like the Old Fella is a textbook example of what eventually happens when a drink problem is allowed to progress unchecked.....I've found it a lot easy to stay sober with the right tools knowledge and *support* most importantly.....I had numerous attempts to stop and stay stopped on my own before this one and it never stuck for very long.....Here's a couple of resources which I found really useful:..The book/YouTube Channel '*This Naked Mind*' and the book '*Alcohol Explained*' really helped me understand my drinking problem and gave me some useful tools to stop and *stay* stopped without feeling like I was depriving myself or missing out on anything... Understanding a bit of the science behind the interaction between Alcohol and the human brain made a big difference!..Hope you'll stick around and keep us posted?..Grab a [Badge](http://sd.bot.nu/badgedate/) too if you want one I find it really motivating to watch the day counter ticking up.....IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
First things first congratulations on 25 days... that in itself is a huge accomplishment. If you take nothing else away from this post please hear that. You did a very hard thing making it the first 25 days and you should be really proud of yourself for that. ..It's crazy how fast cravings can sneak up on you right?..I used to think of it as "going back to square one" when I failed. Stopping that kind of thinking really helped me... I'm not going back to square one I just messed up after a 25 day streak. As long as you learn from it and work to avoid repeating it you're making progress...It may help to make a promise to yourself that the next time you feel a strong urge to drink that you'll do something else first. Maybe that's calling a friend or family member and just chat. Hearing a loved one's voice brings me back to reality. Maybe that's go for a walk or exercise. That helps put me in a better frame of mind. Just something to break the fixation on having a drink right then...Congratulations again on the great start. You messed up big deal get over it and get back on that horse! DO NOT THROW THOSE 25 DAYS AWAY BY LETTING A SLIP UP GET TO YOU! You can do this!
