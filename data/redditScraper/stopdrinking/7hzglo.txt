I was watching tv the other night when I saw a new ad for [Jose Cuervo](https://youtu.be/YlcSA5KI4Lw). The tag line was "Tomorrow is Overrated". I don't know why but that left a real bad taste in my mouth. In fact so bad that I have not stopped thinking about it. My immediate thought was "oh tomorrow is overrated so might as well drink myself to death" followed by the semi less doom and gloom "tomorrow is overrated so might was well relapse". ..I have talked a lot before about how the alcohol culture is smashed in your face on a daily basis and damn near impossible to escape. When you walk in my local meijers the first thing you will see in a Christmas tree filled with tito's vodka bottles wearing ugly christmas sweaters... WTF?! And don't get me started on the "mom's need wine" memes and merch. And tis the season for themed bar crawls! In fact last Saturday there was a huge christmas bar crawl that started at noon and by 8pm the participants were so intoxicated they were starting fights with our hosting staff and had to be escorted off the premises. ..Part of my thinks I am so sensitive to these things because I am in fact sober and do have an alcohol affliction. Not everyone is an alcoholic and they can in fact drink responsibly. But does the average person need to be assaulted with pro drinking culture at every turn? DO they need to have it drilled into their brains that "tomorrow is overrated" and tequila is the answer? ..tldr: I am whiney and went on a tangent about the toxicity of alcohol culture.

Well alcohol is a huge business and to sell it they put the "It's fun so party it up YOLO" tag on it. I don't like seeing it either though
I HATE THAT FREAKING AD! ..Advertising in general is a squicky business. Selling false happiness to anyone who will buy it. Stay strong!
I hear ya and I agree with you totally. Alcohol is not good for anyone it is a physical/mental/spiritual poison no matter who drinks it or at what quantity- so yes I also sometimes think that the cultural in your face thing with ads TV movies stores etc...is a commercial conspiracy to keep people addicted to it.   I just try not to think about this too much; because when I do I realize it is very hard to draw the line.  I mean there are people that are practiacally addicted to anything (food spending money etc...)- and all these other things can be toxic too but they are also everywhere in your face.   First world problems.  Part of the good think about living in the 3rd world is less food and the fact that alcohol is not always in your face and can actually be much much harder to get...but I suppose an addict finds a way to get it anywhere; I know I did. I traveled in countries where alcohol was banned but had no trouble finding it within an hour of landing at the airport and keeping stocked the whole time...
Ugh alcohol culture is my biggest trigger. Bar down the street had a sign saying "Alcohol won't solve your problems...  Neither will water or milk." That one sat with me forever damn...I also feel like this ad you're talking about is so targeted. Because "playing the tape forward" and thinking about tomorrow is a big motivator for people trying to stay sober. So this is literally targeting people who are trying NOT to drink by thinking about tomorrow OR even worse motivating people to drink to the point of fatality...Very very very irresponsible ad and this is from someone who dabbles in advertising...Yikes. 
I hate that ad. I even hated all alcohol ads when I was actively drinking because I didn't find any of the madness that I was in the middle of "fun"... I particularly hate the ad your title is referring to because all I can think is "tell that slogan to people who are dying and every 'tomorrow' may be their freaking last!"- I bet "tomorrow" isn't "overrated" to them...
You are singing the song of my people. I loathe the "mommy needs a glass of wine" memes and the Jose Cuervo ad is horrifying even if you don't have an alcohol problem. What ad company came up with that - sacrifice your future to have fun today? That's the epitome of irresponsibility no matter who you are.
I suspect I know why this leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  It irritates the hell out of me.  I'll tell you why...&gt;not everyone is an alcoholic and they can in fact drink responsibly ..Yep.  And  responsible  drinkers think nothing of having a glass of wine or a margarita with dinner.  *And* **Tomorrow** *isnt anything they think about*.  Because they won't have any ill effects tomorrow from one glass of wine!!..Ah but those of us with Alcohol Use Disorder are a different story!..We have to think about tomorrow because if I'm having ONE Cuervo I'm having 5 or 6 or 10!..That add is irritating because it specifically is for alcoholics!  And that's malice aforethought.  According to Medical Daily 10% of drinkers **Purchase 50% of all alcohol**...That add is NOT for a moderate drinker.  They don't have to worry about tomorrow and any effects...That ad is aimed specifically at US!....
That is not whiney it's completely accurate.  Watch tv and movies they glamorize and normalize drinking too.  It's almost like they glamorize sex along with it.  Walk through the mall one day and look at all the store posters and advertising and guess how old all those girls are.  .All this stuff sinks into our subconscious very easily and anchors deeply in there.  .It's called advertising.  And it's crazy that it's legal.  .At least you can see alcohol advertising for what it is really is now imagine all the people who actually fall for that and think it's just a cool slogan?  Suckers.  .That's my rant.     iwndwyt!!!
Pizza Hut is touting beer and wine delivery as the great salvation..WGAF?.As if taxes from alcohol and pot sales are going to Make America Great Again :o(..
&gt;I am whiney and went on a tangent about the toxicity of alcohol culture...***Preach it!!***
I agree with you 110%.  I can't listen to the radio without hearing a liqour store ad.  I can't go on facebook without seeing the wine memes you mentioned.  Hell I go into work and my boss has a liquor cabinet in his office...Its everywhere theres no escaping that.  All we can do as addicts is learn to be strong and abstain. ..I will not drink with you today.
Tomorrow is overrated Just For Today mate! So in some way they were right :P But the alcohol promotion is really sickening for sure the mass is just blinded or they dont wanna see how big of a real problem it is and it impacts our society all around the globe. I dont think it can ever be stopped its so accepted.
What a dumbass commercial haha. Just saw it. 
I'm living sober today.. : ? )  Fuck tomorrow!..IWNDWYTD!
If I see another "ros  all day" shirt I am going to lose it!
This culture is filled with nihilism and consumerism - alcohol culture is part of that. It can bring many good people down. We must not let it..We must learn for ourselves there is value in this world and that tomorrow is not overrated - if one takes care of it.
