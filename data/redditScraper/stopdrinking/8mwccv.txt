Hi all..This is my first post in a community like this but I figure whether I like it or not I fit right in here so I may as well embrace it if it exists. ..Brief background: 22 y/o male was arrested a few months ago for things that happened while I was blacked out. Haven't had a drink for over a 100 days and also granted a diversion agreement so looks like it'll be a good 500 days before I have the opportunity to step in a bar again \(not saying I will just that I'll be legally allowed to.\) I'd say I have a bit of a different background than most as I'll actually admit that my drinking habits came from my fraternity. Pretty much was hazed/bred into a culture of blacking out any day of the week and doing stupid things with other like\-minded individuals. Well that mentality got me into trouble and all I can say is that I've learned from it and don't plan on ever going back...But let's go to the reason of this post!..Currently a summer intern and also just accepted a new job in a large city in January. One thing I've noticed is that nearly half of the company events have some form of alcohol component to them and then of course all interns/new hires pretty much bond through going out at night and drinking. I'm struggling with 1\) trying to avoid the topic for why I won't step foot in a bar/tavern and 2\) I'm worried about missing out on friendships with fellow new hires for my full time job. It's not that I feel any sort of temptation to steal a drink but rather that I'm just worried on suffering from the social aspect of not even being able to hang out with people. Does anyone have any similar experiences? How did you cope?

Good question! Getting shit canned at work functions was one of the things that made me want to address my drinking head on. If you're able to hang with folks that are drinking you may be surprised at how little they notice that you're sipping on bubble water instead of beer. Plus sounds like you're on a new career path so abstaining from booze is a great way to impress your colleagues whilst also making genuine connections. ..I bet you'll thank yourself for staying sober even if that means you have to leave the event early.

I agree with the above post. The interns may be getting shit faced but the senior leadership isn't  at least not publicly.  The people who know where they are going are up at 5am getting in a workout before they get to the office at 7 and start prioritizing their work day. None of the boozers are going to be signing off on a raise or promotion for you. What seminars should you be looking at? What opportunities to fraternize with the people who can help your career? You're not a college kid anymore. But if you ever miss the drinking buddies you can find them right where you left them. Five years10 years on alot of them will be stuck to the same bar stools they're sitting on now. Congratulations on the job. IWNDWYT
