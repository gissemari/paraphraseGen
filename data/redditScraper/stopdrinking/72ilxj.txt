Day 32 so that's the longest run Ive had without alcohol since I was about 16. I'm 46 feels good.....no desire to drink at all so please take faith if you're struggling....I had many false starts in my 30 year career....something has shifted in me this time and it's not taken a lot of work so please go easy on yourself....all is coming...
