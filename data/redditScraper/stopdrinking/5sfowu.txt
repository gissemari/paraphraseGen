I relapsed yet again.  Drank about ten days ago (the Friday before last) and have drank the last four nights in a row.  Frustrated with myself.  I need more support.  I think it's time to try AA again.

well my friend at least you realize you're going the wrong way be careful with drinking in a row! try not to drink tonight or drink much less physical dependency is no fun! we are here for you!
your brain and  body is craving alcohol which is why your prolly drinking every day. I know for me  its like that. when I drink the next day all of a sudden I get these intentions urges around the time I had drank the previous day 
The cravings hit about the same time you drink everyday so it would help to be occupied doing something else during these times and ride out the cravings. It's not that hard trust me. When those cravings hit it may seem like the end of the world is coming and a sense of doom and gloom but those feelings pass in lesson hour only to be replaced by more normal happy thoughts .
