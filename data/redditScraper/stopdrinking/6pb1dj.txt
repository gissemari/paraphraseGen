I say being aware instead of sober because it really is what it's been like. Yes sometimes the feelings are overwhelming or underwhelming and that's when it's not so great. But once you persevere being fully present is truly amazing and so refreshing. It keeps on giving and I'm only a month in. I've also lost 2kg without even trying. So here's to month 2! Hope this can inspire someone struggling today. Just remember that when you're sober - tomorrow can only get better which is exactly the opposite of when you're drinking!

I absolutely love the idea of using "aware" in place of sober. Congrats on the 1st month and keep it up! I will not drink with you today
Yes I'm experiencing increased awareness for sure! It's great to be so much more aware of myself and my surroundings however I've also found it a bit disturbing (in some ways) to observe the harsh realities so acutely.
Way to go!  If you want a badge there is a link in the sidebar.  A lot of people said after 60 days the benefits start compounding.  I can't wait to find out.  I won't drink with you today.
I absolutely love this post! Thank you for helping me. .For me the first month was this post completely "pink cloud" if you will. Month 2 hit me like a ton of bricks. I kept thinking "where did all of my motivation and inspiration go? why is this happening? I was so happy last week so strong and willing" I really struggled in my second month. I hope that the same doesn't happen for you but if it does I want you to know that I made it. ..What worked for me:.Realizing where the thoughts were coming from understanding..Get up. Get out. Waaaay easier said than done when your mind takes you to those dark places but if you want it.. you'll do it..Don't isolate. Call. Walk. Pray...Thank you for your sobriety &amp; today thank you for mine. Your post has helped me!
