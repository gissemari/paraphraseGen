After drinking for two days A ridiculous amount of vodka I had a very scary experience. I'm a 28 year old female for reference. While on my way to pick up more liquor at 11am my hands curled up into a tight unnatural looking fist completely involuntarily. My body temperature rose dramatically and I was sweating profusely. Luckily I was able to stop my car. It was so frightening. It seemed to be the same symptoms of a stroke and after researching I found how much alcohol can raise the chances of a steoke. I went into the hospital and they gave me fluids and said I was severely dehydrated. They kind of ignored my mini stroke idea when I said I was an alcoholic go figure  ....Still never know really if it was a mini stroke or not. I'm on day 5 again now.  Alcohol destroys the body not just the liver. Iwndwyt

Oh my god- that's so scary.  Thank you so much for sharing this.
I'm glad you are okay! When I was binging really hard before I got sober my hands would sometimes cramp into fists involuntarily and it would scare the shit out of me. Not enough to stop drinking of course! The insanity of booze....thanks for sharing!
That is scary I'm so happy that you are okay.
It could have also been a bad cramp due to dehydration.  I used to get them in my hands and feet while in a bender.
