In about one hour Ive a meeting with my rehab conselour and my boss. Im gonna put myself first. I cannot work 100% right now without having a bigger risk for a relapse. Or more like just waiting for the relapse to happen because it will if I dont do something. Im gonna make it clear that I need to focus on me now less work less stress. This is hard for me because Ive set high standards for me in my work life. At least my alcoholic behaviour havent risked my work I thought and therefor Ive no alcoholproblem. But it will effect work if I dont put myself first now. I am worth living a better life. Today at about 8 weeks sober I am standing up for my sobreity and my health.

I'm sorry your boss is not meeting with you. That sounds really frustrating. ..&gt; I am worth living a better life..So true. I will not drink with you today.
