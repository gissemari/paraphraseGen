When I first discovered SD it blew my mind discovering that I was not alone. Lurkers and dinos fighters and fellow travellers thank you for sharing your struggles and victories. It means more than you know. ..I will not drink with you today!

Ditto!..I will not drink with y'all today.    within  
Right?! I could never imagine going to meetings. Finding around the clock (and wildly convenient) support has been so helpful.
I never high-five... but OK just this once! :)
Whatever I've needed to hear whenever I've needed to hear it someone on Stop Drinking has always said just the right thing to help.   Happy to be here not drinking with you.  We're not alone buddy :)
I love this sub because its 24/7.You can come here for inspiration and read others stories and if you need to chat you can..For me its been far more useful than meetings and honestly the important part has been that you can be honest without feeling judged by human eyes..Hang in there and keep coming back when you need to..Don't worry about karma and up votes here. It means nothing..More people read these stories and take something from them than you could ever realise..Just do your best know you are worth more get through it and know IWNDWYT
