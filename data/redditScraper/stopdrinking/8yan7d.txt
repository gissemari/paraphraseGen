So a while back I posted about how hard "good days" were. My routine in the past was the celebrate into oblivion. Being sober made these good days really difficult. Recently I got my masters degree. That day was a huge challenge. This week I landed my first full time job with salary and benefits. I'm over 100 days sober and this w the first time I didn't struggle with wanting to celebrate. I guess this is a testimate to the song that it gets easier as time goes on but I truly was able to just be happy in the moment. I'm still in constant lookout for the relapse lawyer telling me I'm good to go for another drink but I just wanted to share my experience of being able to accept the natural high of good news.

That's awesome congratulations!  I had the same issue -- it really threw me for a loop.  I felt like if I got 'too happy' then I drank how messed up was I?  It was harder than I thought to get over those feelings.  Great job on the job and the 100 days!
Congratulations! and Bravo for a century of days!
Congratulations!  
It gets better. Not always easier! But compared to drinking days yes easier. Congrats on the job. And congtrats on &gt; 100 days sober!
Congratulations I hope everything goes well for you in your new job!
