I'd like to share with you guys a nightmare i had last week...I'd befriended a girl and had a crush on her. She worked at a bar. When i dropped by to visit at closing hour she offered me to try some special beer they'd recently had on sale free of charge..She prepared it really nicely set it on the counter and just smiled at me expecting me to at least try it..I'm very eager to please and never turn down offered food/drink and i wanted to impress my crush so i was paralyzed. .I got out and left the bar and could do nothing but pace the road outside calculating in my mind if a symbolic sip of beer was worth the risk of relapse or having to reset my badge and all that... Ultimately i walked back in the bar and told her sorry can't take you up on your offer i don't drink..She just smiled dumped the beer in the sink and got me a soda...I woke up exhausted but it was a nice change of pace from the usual nightmares and thought it was remarkable enough to share.

I get similar nightmares!!  .Funny enough in most of my dreams about relapse someone is handing me a bottle and every time I've had a dream like that that person turns out to be bad for me. Im not superstitious but it sure is spooky
