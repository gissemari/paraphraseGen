Hey guys. Just wanted to check in. It's been a weird couple months with a couple relapses thrown in. I'm twenty-five days sober today and feeling pretty good about it. Some moments are for sure harder than others. ..I've been making it a point to consistently go to meetings. Monday-Saturday there's a noon meeting near me and I was at all six of them last week. ..Yesterday I asked a woman to be my sponsor. I kind of stumbled over the words and was like "Ummm...I need a sponsor? And was wondering if you'd be willing?" Fortunately she said she was very willing and gave me her number. I called her today to check in and decide when we'd have our first meeting. That was a huge hurdle for me. I hate being responsible and I hate making phone calls. ..It's been nice to become part of a community through meetings. Everyone in the one I go to are all good people who want each other to succeed. ..My sponsor was glad to hear I have a sober online community to chat with if I need extra support. Man it feels weird being all up in the AA program. I guess this is a solid moment of gratitude as well. ..Thanks to the people here who suggested I go to meetings. It was worth it. :-)

Oh it sounds like you are doing great - Well done!! Am pleased that you are sorted out with a sponsor and can start doing the steps - you sound really motivated and focussed. ..I got a sponsor last night too! It was 'suggested' to me. The reason I didn't ask earlier was that fear of rejection. So anyway I texted her (I know!)  and she said she would be delighted. She doesn't know me well yet lol!   ..We can do this!   IWNDWYT   
Way to go! A really important lesson I learned in AA is that I can feel uncomfortable or that I don't like doing something (like being responsible or calling my sponsor or calling another person in the program to ask how their day is going) and I can go ahead and do it anyway. In every single instance the fear is always worse than the actual act. The more I actually just push through the momentary discomfort and follow through the easier it becomes and the better I feel about myself. This simple willingness to act has made a huge difference to my self-esteem and has helped me so much in areas outside of my sobriety as well. Glad you're here and keep it up!
