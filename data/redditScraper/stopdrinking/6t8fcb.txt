Yesterday I went to an "obligatory" happy hour with my team at work.  Instead of checking out the drink/beer menu I went straight to the "other" section and ordered a fizzy-water with lime.  I had my first (more will come kind of a thing with my work team) HH and did not struggle!  What's more no one even commented or seemed to notice.  And after an hour or so I went home and have had NO residual thoughts or regrets of "missing out"!  This is huge for me (and also very humbling at the same time).  Instead of my mind saying "Oh see you can control it" my mind didn't even play the old tapes (but I'll still remain vigilant)...Thx SD and I will not drink again with y'all today!

Good for you! Congrats on 36 - you've got this. Stay strong and keep coming back. I will not drink with you today.
That's awesome. Congratulations friend! I love being able to have the extra calories and munch on some appetizers too
