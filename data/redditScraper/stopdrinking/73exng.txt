Get rid of it. Being sober and having a clear mind brings such a sense of peace. I'm only on Day 6 but I have gone longer before. My drinking brought so much chaos into my life. A DUI. Ruined relationships. Family and work struggles. Health issues. Depression and anxiety. Getting alcohol out of my life is imperative for my health and happiness. If I don't have sobriety I don't have anything. I feel so much better after just five days of not drinking. Along with eating healthy and mild exercise (walking and hiking) I have brought into my life a peace that has made me never want to go back to my old ways. It will be a long process of healing after many years of destroying my health and happiness but I am playing the long game. I will not drink with you all today :)
