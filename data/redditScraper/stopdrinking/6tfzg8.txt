I've been here before. Relapsed more times than I can count. Wrestled with this beast for years. ..It can go on no longer. I have a job I love. It's not a career but it pays a good wage and suits my lifestyle (morning person)...We've got plenty of stoners goofballs and partiers but I started getting the reputation of being a fat stinkin drunk. ..A lot of things slide here but once certain people start to talk about you it's dominoes. ..I show up wrecked from the night before at 7 am and my productivity proved it. After I got off and proceeded to start drinking again I get a text from a co-worker saying the managers are pulling up footage of me. I instantly go into fuck mode. I call him up and he tells me everyone has been talking behind my back saying I smell like a brewery. ..I came into work today thoroughly expecting to get fired. Boss rolls in pulls me to the break room and basically slaps me on the wrist with a verbal warning. I opened up and told him this was a long time coming. He looked relieved that I could own my mistakes and that I had some awareness at my condition. He told me if I need any thing he's there. I genuinely feel as though a higher power has smiled Mercy down upon me but one thing is abundantly clear......I will not drink with you all tonight.

So glad you are not drinking with us today.  Sounds like a really scary situation.  I had a similar period where my work colleagues had a lot to say (behind my back!) about my drinking... I wish I had listened to that wakeup call instead of waiting another two years to do something about it!!..What are your biggest temptations or triggers for drinking?  Are there any tips or strategies that you could use from the folks here at /r/stopdrinking?..Not drinking with you today!
Thank goodness for an understanding boss (maybe he's been there). Here's a quote that has been helpful to me (maybe from this sub? maybe from annie grace? can't remember): "I've started to treat my FIRST drink as the one that brings all the pain and suffering and consequences. It's not the 15th drink. It's not the 30th... It's the first one. It's the only one that matters."
