Lifelong self-sabotage. I got to almost 100 days last winter and then drank twice in four days. Then two months later another slip of a few days...My birthday is coming up and it is always a sad day for me. It isn't the aging (I don't think - not that I love being soo close to turning 50!); I have struggled with holidays and birthdays my whole life wondering why I'm not having as much fun as I  should be.  I used to like working on my birthday bc.then I had low expectations...I don't feel like drinking but am recognizing the self-sabotaging feeling s like preparing to isolate or binge or potentially drink if I do get that urge...Oh well; thanks for listening everybody. Have a great sober remainder of the weekend and I will do the same...IWNDWYT

Wishing you the best
Don't worry:  I recently sabotaged my alcoholism.  It worked out ok.  IWNDWYT 
Self sabotage is the worsttttt. Alcoholics or not we humans have a great ability of destroying ourselves for no good reason. ..Just remind yourself you are worthy of self love patience and personal growth. You deserve the above and much more!...IWNDWYT and happy birthday!
