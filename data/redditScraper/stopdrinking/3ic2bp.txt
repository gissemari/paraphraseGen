Hi all!!! ..I have been back from Ireland for about two weeks ago but haven't truly had a chance to sit down and reflect on anything. As soon as I got back I had another job! Walked in and was hired. So now I'm working two jobs one from 7AM-130PM the other from 4PM-11PM. I work both jobs 4 days and only one job on two other days and overall it's extremely busy. ..So I just wanted to check in let you all know that I've been reading even if I haven't had the chance to respond. I managed to stay sober in Ireland despite many (*many*) cravings by remembering all that I have posted here remembering to keep myself accountable and remembering to keep my sobriety my priority. ..Sobriety is amazing. For all those struggling it *does* get better. Life becomes livable again I promise. And if you're struggling reach out. There are people who *want* to help. There are people who *rely* on helping. ..I don't know what else to say other than I'm not drinking today. ..Love ..BAF

Congrats on keeping sobriety your priority!  I'm excited to join you in those big numbers some day!
I am so proud of you.  Thanks for checking in you've been missed!
Envious of ur trip and jobs nice work!!
Here's the question that's burning for me right now:..Did you find a way to reduce to blindness to maybe "as shit" levels?  Medical advances with new science and such.....Thanks for being sober today!
