I relapsed tonight after 100 days free from alcohol. How do I move forward? I've learned that I cannot go to a bar and just hang out. I've let down myself and my family.

Don't be too hard on yourself. I frequently relapsed at around the 3 month mark  before this last round of sobriety. 100 days is a really good run. What did you learn? What strategies helped you stay sober? What led you to relapse? Is there anything different you can do moving forward that would ensure you're sobriety? 
One day at a time same as you did for those 100 days.  A relapse isn't the end of the world happens to a lot of people.
That is some incredibly heavy news. I am very sorry to hear you went through that.
