Three months ago today I made one of the best decisions I have made in my entire life: I stopped drinking. Things have just kept getting better and better. It's amazing. I haven't felt this good in a long long time. ..And for those of you who are still struggling to get sober just remember it takes one step at a time. Once you make that first choice and stick with it it gets easier and easier to abstain. In the last few months I have actually been offered alcohol/beer numerous times and each time I have been adamant and turned it down. Nowadays I don't even have any desire to drink at all. ..It's crazy I never thought I could get here. But here I am and I am looking forward to another 3 months and another after that and so on.....Thanks so much to the /r/stopdrinking community! You guys are the best. I am very thankful that this board exists. I don't think I am cut out for AA or what not (maybe someday) so the support here has been incalculable. ..Here's to the rest of my life sober! ;)

Congratulations! Keep it up. ..Have you noticed any areas of your life improving?
Congrats! I really hope to be in your shoes soon! Keep it up and keep us posted!
Getting sober is hard work! Good job! I think it's easier to stay sober than to get sober so keep it up. 
Congratulations! Keep up the good work! 
Awesome job on getting to 3 months. Make sure you don't get complacent that's when the liquid terroist makes his move. ..I'm speaking from experience here as my last run was 97 days...Congrats and keep on trucking 1 day at a time...Sail!
Congratulations!!!
Nicely done.
