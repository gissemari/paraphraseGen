I have relapsed so many times and each time I would end up consuming more for a longer period of time.  I have been drinking for over 20 years. It started as only on holidays to weekends to a few days a week to every night. It has lost its fun and has become more of a habit. A year and a half ago I had 10 months sober and I remember those as being some of the best months. I was truly happy and lost 50 lbs. I want to get back to that. ..Im trying to not let negative thoughts enter my mind and I am only focusing on the positive. So many stories on here have inspired me and I want to get to where many of you are. I know it's not easy but anything worth having never comes easy.  This post is mostly for my own accountability. I'm going to try to post everyday for the next 10 days. ..IWNDWYT
