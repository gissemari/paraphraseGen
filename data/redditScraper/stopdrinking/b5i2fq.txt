This is the first day I've really struggled since getting sober. I don't mean  struggling  in the sense that I'm craving a drink - I mean just morale-wise. I feel like my brain chemistry is messed up. I'm constantly tired and not getting much enjoyment out of anything that historically made me happy. My libido sucks too. I feel like I'm grasping at straws to feel anything today. Had been avoiding marijuana too since getting sober but my weed pen has been calling my name today.

It takes a while for our brain chemistry to get back to normal.  This is normal.  
I'm on day 8 and still struggling with mood swings anxiety depression anger. This is why I quit in the first place. I hope it gets righted with time because I feel like even with all of the meditation in the world it won't fix how low I feel.
