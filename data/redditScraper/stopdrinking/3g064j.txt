.If the question is 'what to do whilst waiting for your gate to be called' looks like the answer is definitely 'Drink. Drink! DRINK!" - I've been to this airport plenty of times and of course I've sat myself down in a pub and got myself lightly sozzled over the course of a couple of hours of waiting post-security for the flight. ..Today I've been wandering in a fucking circle bored off of my mind. Doesn't help that this is my second day after a recent relapse either. It's just bar bar bar WH Smiths bar bar duty free bar duty free Boots...Even the Starbucks sells booze! ..I am not enjoying this.

I can relate-I always went to the same bar and even began to recognize the bartenders! I'm a Brit living in the USA with a Bestie in Australia so I am well used to visiting them and spending the dead time just boozing it up...Last time I went to Oz the ONLY reason I didn't go to the bar (which is hella expensive of course) was because I already had a raging hangover from the night before and couldn't face the idea of a drink. I can only suggest the obvious here and say listen to music read a great book do Sudoku or crosswords or....GET that coffee and pat yourself on the back for not imbibing. ..On my flight to Oz I didn't even drink on the plane and I have to say I felt a hell of a lot better after the 14 hour journey without alcohol in my system. Less groggy dehydrated fewer trips to the toilet.   I don't really know what else to say other than I know what you're going through. I'll be going through the same thing next month and I know I'll need help from you all. Too many bad things can happen if you have a drink-spending money you could use for your trip getting too drunk and missing your flight breathing alcohol on your fellow travelers not having your full faculties when you arrive at your destination etc. Stay strong and have a good flight!
Yeah I always looked forward to responsibility-free drinking when I was waiting for a flight.  I had my first flight sober last month and it was a challenge not to hit the airport bars.  I found a good book at a store bought something sweet and spent lots of time on facebook and SD.  Hang in!
