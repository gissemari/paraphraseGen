Not sure why this is on my mind perhaps a post on struggling....I am here to tell you that sooner or later sobriety is not a struggle - it becomes a way of life - a much better way of life...YES in the beginning I struggled in fact I slipped and slid gnashed my teeth flailed around and probably made it harder than it had to be.  But it took what it took. And after I got over myself under around and through the various hurdles - I came to understand that **being sober was a lot easier** than what I had been doing...**I wasn't lying - to my boss my wife my kids and myself**  For me that was HUGE.  Talk about keeping it simple how about the truth?..**I was much more productive** Funny how you can get things done in the morning when 1. you are out of bed 2. not suffering 3. not having fix or explain what happened last night...**My shame level was greatly reduced** just by no longer doing stupid shame engendering things - imagine that...**as a result I could begin to start building self esteem**  whoa doggies. Come out from under that rock!..Recovery grew on me.  I learned I did not have to be right all the time. (or if I was not to have to tell others they were wrong).  That's not a little thing when dealing with boss or wife or children especially...I had learned that there was no situation alcohol could not make worse. So what possible allure did drinking have?  None...I got sober in '87 - the process took time - I grew I still found ways to make an ass out of myself I learned from that and moved on.  There were struggles - but they were job marriage life related - and again I did not make any of them worse by drinking...I went through stuff - things did not go my way at work my marriage proved not to be savable - my parents got sick and died - I dated and remarried - I got promoted and challenged at work - put in positions where failure was expected.  and then sept 11 happened close by I saw it at eye level from a neighboring building evacuated into chaos and for the first time in years I had the urge to drink to take refuge in a small dark bar we were passing... I kept walking.  Just like you are doing one foot in front of the other...Since then - not always smooth sailing but a great life especially because I am no longer doing self defeating things...  I don't hang out with serious drinkers though some friends have a glass of wine or two on occasion (and leave some!!!)..Finally in recovery I have been given a set of tools which enable me to put things in the proper perspective - which essentially means not taking a lot of shit personally.  It's that simple but yeah it does take some time and experience to get there... but you can do it and it starts by not drinking today.
