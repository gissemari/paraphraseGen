Caved in and had three beers. I regret it partially but I'll be alright. I notice I feel more annoyed today I guess I am annoyed at myself for giving In to the demon juice..but again I'll be alright can sonebidy tell me how to get a badge? I'm fully committedto my sobriety this time around and I see no reason to not divert from self destruction. That headache was horrible.

I wish I could tell you. I put in over about week ago for a badge but there is a glitch in the system. They said there was no need to reapply but to just wait for it. The badge thing is over on the right sidebar. 
It's been a week since my counter updated you'll be submitting your sober date it doesn't start at day 1 when you get it (unless it is your date obviously). ..Just apply for a badge and be a little patient. Surf the topics in the interim!
