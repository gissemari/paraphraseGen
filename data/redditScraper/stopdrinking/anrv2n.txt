I'm an alcoholic. You wouldn't assume that by looking at me  when I talk about my struggles to people they say  You don't look like that  or  But you seem so innocent!  In reality I've been hospitalized twice blackout every time I drink and have ended up in some really compromising situations. I've been in outpatient once but dropped out halfway through because I'm a full time student and I couldn't work while going to outpatient. I'm just so so lost. I've been drinking for 7 years been suspended from school because of it. I can't let this ruin my life more than it already has. I don't know how much more of this I can take. I already struggle with a slew of diagnosed mental issues. Why am I this way????

I really dislike the term alcoholic because it just creates an us vs them mentality where your drinking isn't a problem unless you're homeless under a bridge. Like you don't wait until you're morbidly obese to go on a diet you get on one when you notice a little bulge...it's such a spectrum. ..Anyway. You can do this :)
