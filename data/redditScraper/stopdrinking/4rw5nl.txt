Wow never thought I would be sober this long or that I would ever do it with the help of AA...I am as atheist as they come and while my mind still hardens at the mention of God and such AA has really helped me and Ihave no doubt that my continuing sobriety counts on my commitment to the program...If there are other atheists out there struggling I say just try to give AA a shot. Something about sharing around the tables is incredibly cathartic and even just listening often gives some much needed balance to thoughts. ..Today I am feeling good and grateful to everyone here and in groups. Thanks for your time.

hardest one IMO..congrats!!
I've been thinking about going to a AA meeting but I was hesitant because of the religion factor.  Thanks for posting this it was like you  read my mind.  Congrats on your 30 day chip!
Congratulations on your 30 days.
My home group of AA is very "religion lite". I get strength from attending meetings. 
I've said this before many times: Re AA &amp; god plenty in my AA group preferred the term "my higher power". Some even considered the AA group or the AA community to be their "higher power"..I ain't no religious zealot I did however find AA provided me a positive net benefit.
