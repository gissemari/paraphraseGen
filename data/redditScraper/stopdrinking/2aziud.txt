Hi Guys  are there any alternatives to AA? I've been struggling with not drinking for a year now and the longest I've gone is a month... Then I feel like I can have a drink or two at HH and invariably a few days later I'm drinking in the morning. AA does not help. Sometimes with all the talking about drinking makes me want to drink

#### Resources and Groups..Other subreddits..* [Here is a listing of subreddits related to addiction addiction support and the problems that often come along with addiction.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/links)..Many people find real-life support groups or certain books helpful in achieving and maintaining their sobriety. Here are links to a few of the more popular resources...* [Alcoholics Anonymous](http://www.aa.org/lang/en/central_offices.cfm?origpage=373)  ([Agnostic AA](http://www.agnosticaanyc.org/worldwide.html)).* Allen Carr books -  [Easy Way to Control Alcohol](http://www.amazon.com/Allen-Carrs-Easy-Control-Alcohol/dp/0572028504) / [Easy Way to Stop Drinking](http://www.amazon.com/The-Easy-Way-Stop-Drinking/dp/1402736479).  These two books are substantially similar. A free preview is [available on Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=yPlPhQNv3RcC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false)..* [LifeRing](http://lifering.org/).* [Rational Recovery](https://rational.org/index.php?id=1).* [SMART Recovery](http://www.smartrecovery.org/).* [Women for Sobriety](http://www.womenforsobriety.org/)..
There are many.  [Here's a link](http://gabrielleglaser.com/her-best-kept-secret/aa-alternatives/)  to quite a few recovery methods. 
You can also see an addictions counselor.  
Try SMART recovery or look into outpatient programs in your area.
If you're in the U.S. every county has a Substance Abuse counseling center.  Some states run them themselves others contract them out.  The easiest way to find them is to call the local county mental health office or check here:  http://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/..If you have health insurance you might have better luck checking your health insurance's web site for Substance Abuse providers.  That way you know which ones are covered.  
Wow thank you so much. I live in sf and this is a very sincere request-would anyone want to hang out tomorrow? 
Also I don't know how to post appriately - but I just drank and I feel good and guilty 
Welcome to the community pakitaffy.  ..Here's the thing and I really hope you don't take this the wrong way.  ..Are you serious about quitting drinking?...The reason I ask is that if you had spent any amount of time reading /r/stopdrinking at all you'd already know the answer to your question.  People talk about AA alternatives here every day several times per day.  Searching google for "AA Alternative" brings up a ton of relevant information...I'm not chastising you for asking the question.  That's what we're here for.  Ask away.  What I'm doing is asking you to examine yourself.  You say you want to quit drinking. I believe that part of you wants to quit drinking.  But what have you done to make that a reality?  What have you read?  What information have you acquired?  How much time have you spent on this?..I quit over two years ago using this subreddit as my primary resource.  No groups other than this sub.  You can do it too.  But I also read every single post and comment that was ever posted here.  I threw myself into it.  I spent hours a day here.  Ya see what I'm saying?  That is what it takes.  Dedication.  Education.  Immersion.  You're not going to pull this off by reading a few threads on a message board.  You said "AA doesn't work" and that makes me think that you didn't try all that hard.  No group can do the hard work for you ya know?  You're not going to pull this off by just showing up at a group like SMART Recovery and sitting in the seat for an hour a few times per week.  Whichever method you choose it is going to take a lot of work.  We're talking like a dozen hours per week outside of whatever meetings you choose (should you choose meetings) at a bare minimum...It took me a very long time before I realized this btw.  I struggled for so long. The problem that whole time was with me. I said I wanted something but my actions were not aligned with my mouth...It is entirely doable.  If I can quit anyone can quit.  Literally anyone.  That includes you.  But you're gonna have to make a commitment.  You're gonna have to do some hard work. It's going to take up a lot of your time.  It is painful at times. It is not easy.  But it IS worth it.  ..I'm glad you found us.  Read as much as you can.  Comment as much as you can.  Badges are available in the sidebar.  The solution -- your solution -- is out there. You've just got to go get it.
