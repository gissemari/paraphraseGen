I understand that John Mayer also struggled with alcohol and that he has been sober for some time now.  His album "Born and Raised" has so many songs about transitions ("Shadow Days" "Born and Raised" "Walt Grace's Submarine Test January 1967") and even directly about problem drinking ("Whiskey Whiskey Whiskey").  The undercurrent of hope forgiveness and change that runs through this album really speaks to me...Not too keen on "Love is a verb" (which was pointed out in another thread on Reddit to contain 20-something instances of the word "love" ironically used always as a noun :p) but I've been playing the album on repeat for a while now as I geared up to make this change myself.  Now I'm looking for similarly-inspiring albums/tunes to change things up a bit especially by artists that have struggled with and given up booze.  I love all sorts of music.  Any recommendations?

Oh man good question... I'm not sure if I have any albums that have symbolized sobriety for me but this song certainly has. It doesn't address alcohol in particular so much as it does addiction as a whole.  ..Fair warning I'm a 6'7" grown a$$ man and this one has made me weep when I've been beaten up praying for any hope at all.  ..***I sincerely wish you find comfort in it as I did in my darkest moments - it was always a light that reminded me a better future was still out there:*** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhlg4gsXxqU 
Brantley Gilbert "Just As I Am". I love this song. And my love is a verb  
A Perfect Circle is the band the album is 13th Step...For me pretty profound. Written more to the alcoholic/addict than from but it's still excellent.
Absolutely in love with Born and Raised album as well as Paradise Valley in which many considered underwhelming.  Maybe I'm just a huge Mayer fan in general.  I don't have any suggestions for new music but I have to say his song In The Blood is really resonating with me and my sobriety at the moment.  His lyrics "I can feel the love I want / I can feel the love I need / but it's never gonna come the way I am" hit me so hard.  I know its meaning isn't directly alcohol related but that line is so visceral and poignant to me right now. ..Considering you enjoy John Mayer if you find any new music you end up enjoying I'd love to stay in the loop!  Always on the hunt for new tunes for these recent feels &amp; experiences.  Happy to not drink with you today!
