Today was a struggle in regards of not drinking. I felt let down by my husband who is abroad with his family and today he didn't even find five minutes to talk to me and my best friend who helped me through my first two evenings of not drinking had to go home. So I'm alone. But I didn't drink. Which is great because I could just do it and nobody would know but I don't want to. I want to stay strong and not give in. .Thank you guys for being here with me. I'm going to sleep now and I will wake up without hangover. Good night!

Great job. Be sure to reward yourself with something you enjoy that's obviously n/a lol
One girl i knew kept on talking with me about how she could unwrap a starburst with just her tongue all night. 14 year old me thought that was weird. Older me knows what she was trying to get at.
