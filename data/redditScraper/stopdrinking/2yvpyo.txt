So I'm off on my business trip tomorrow. ..Five nights alone in a hotel. Colleagues asking me out for drinks. The Urbanrunnner they've always known (first time back in five years) was always first in the bar and always last to leave. Nobody to watch me. Nobody to let down (but myself)...I had the most vivid drink dream I've had ever last night. I went straight from the airport with a bottle of vodka and literally downed it in one in my hotel room. I woke up (IRL) and could actually taste it...It makes no odds that I'm so close to a year. I think most alcoholics can relate to that. Being so close to a year makes me even more nervous in fact as my mentality has always been that if I'm going to do something I should I may as well go hard...I'm not tee-ing up a relapse here. But I am concerned. I mentioned on local SD thread that I was visiting but I'll say it again now. ..Monday and Tuesday are going to be the toughest days for me I reckon (I have non drinking events Wed & Thursday and leave Friday). So if anyone fancies meeting up after work (6ish) let me know...Cheers

Good luck!
Hey Urbanrunner good to see you! I have not yet been to the UK as a sober person but I'll be over in August and I already feel a little queasy about it. The drink culture in that part of the world is something to be reckoned with. I think you are wise to prepare yourself for it. When I go over I plan on mentioning to a few key people beforehand that I've quit drinking. I'm going to refuse to meet people in pubs. I'm going to keep in touch with sober people I know in the States and check in on here. And I'm going to research AA meetings before I go and print off a list to take with me. I know meetings aren't your bag but even if you don't come up with a meeting list maybe look for things to do in case things get a bit hairy like movies that are on or see if Time Out has something...May the force be with you.
