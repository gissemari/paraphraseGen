I am committing myself to post regularly (daily being my goal) - and in doing so reliably documenting my road/trial to recovery/failure......"The sweats" really define both the physical and mental hurdles of the struggle. Being "hooked" and trying to get "clean". Avoiding "the devils drink" is a very trying task.....I have spent the last 12 months waking up with a headache; drinking a  decent volume of water - often over the course of the night; subsequently feeling nauseous but waking showering and preparing myself for work despite my clear disability.... Outcomes it seems can very easily quiet any concern about the process that drives the ultimate result.....At the same time I have spent almost equal time padding and re-padding my armpits with tissue (usually 3-4 times an hour) to counteract the physical withdrawal: the sweating is unbelievable... ..In padding my body I am much more weakly but symbolically padding my mind. It will not continue. Day two is about to begin in earnest...Thanks for reading / listening....rrv2..

Keep doing have you thought about offering to endorse Bounty Paper towels? ;-)      ..Be aware that detox can be dangerous and please seek medical help - especially if you begin to hallucinate or shake...it will get better
Good job on the update.  By the way my body and even my body temperature changed after I was sober awhile.  
I really relate to your experience...The only solution (which I desperately wanted to avoid) was to stop drinking!..-Good luck PP..
I live in a hot place and I always blamed it on that. But I new better. People dont sweat in A/C because they went to get some water.
