There I said it. The only reason I don't do it is because I just got a sponsor and we have our first meeting tomorrow. I don't want to give a first bad impression. But the depression is too much today.

Fight it! You have put yourself on a path of happiness and health which you deserve. You are experiencing new things and getting out of your comfort zone. That is admirable and you should be proud!..I won't be drinking with you today!
You got this! Way to step out of the dark and twisty for a minute to get it off your chest. What are your plans? I was super depressed yesterday so I went to outside for a bit and it kinda helped. So then I got in my car and blasted music as loud as it would go and just drove. I put in a CD I found from highschool which was before my life got super crazy and it helped my mood a ton. Then I sat at the AA building and went to 3 meetings talking to people inbetween. Not really about anything just needed some human contact...I hope you find something that brightens your mood - there is always the chat room here ")..[High Five](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg)
Good for getting a sponsor. I suffer from lifelong depression and there are some days when I fear falling into the black hole again. But my sponsor has kept me grounded and accountable and I do take effective medication. Being sober means the bad days will fade so long as sobriety is my priority.
Consider calling your sponsor right now to talk about exactly this. Drinking alcohol to get out of depression is like hitting the accelerator when your car's stuck in the mud. You hope it'll work maybe you even move a few feet but then you end up spinning your wheels and sinking deeper. What you need is a tow truck. Let your sponsor give you a tow.
It's not worth it! Have you looked into [Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome](http://alcoholrehab.com/addiction-recovery/post-acute-withdrawal-symptoms/) (PAWS) at all? My first few months were **really** rough and I was sure I'd feel like that forever. Around 2-3 months life got a lot better and then by 4 months I found actual *real* joy in sobriety. Not to say that it's still not hard because ohmygod sometimes it's so hard. But I pushed passed that tough time and discovered that there really is a lot to love about being booze free. ..Stay strong! I won't drink with you. 
Hey stay strong. Get through today. No drinking today. You can recommit tomorrow but promise us you'll fall asleep sober tonight! :)
