One week tomorrow. To everyone who wrote about your airport victory thank you for being my motivator. Reading them definitely helped me have intention of not giving in so I can join your cool club. Confession - I always arrived early to drink. Aside from red eye and 6am flights I have never been on a plane without drinking one tall beer. Delay? You can bet I ordered another tall. Night flight? I'll have a glass or three of wine...Arrived in the morning for my first flight at a newly renovated terminal. I counted FOUR wine establishments (no food just alcohol) from security to my gate. All open at nine IN THE MORNING. That's a first. Those don't include restaurants. Has anyone else been to an airport with alcohol spots open before/at 9am?..Second airport I counted three alcohol establishments gate to gate. Third airport I counted one but every other mural was a liquor ad. I've never noticed how many there are in airports until I made a conscious observation today. Huge eye opener...Thanks to my travel buddy for keeping me accountable. To everyone in America and expats traveling this holiday weekend or getting extra days off work I feel your struggle. I know this weekend is our first summer vacation excuse. Please travel safe be responsible and make great memories. IWNDWYT!

Nice! Way to go.  It is crazy how alcohol is everywhere.  Why would an airport need that many establishments?
