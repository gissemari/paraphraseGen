I just finished midterms (woohoo). I don't think I did as well as I normally do (I'm an honours student) because this semester has been rocky since my relapse. I was sober all week but foggy found studying and concentrating hard almost had a panic attack during an exam but I made it through 6 midterms and didn't drink!..Now I have a week off. I've made plans for the weekend with sober friends so that will help keep me busy. I plan to start going back to AA during the week despite really not wanting to. Throwing myself a  pity party and making excuses even though I know AA works for me. was 3 years sober in AA before relapsing...ANywho ramble over just wanted to check in. ..Happy Pride weekend y'all

There are alternatives to AA.  AA is peer support which is a band aid solution to your problems that make you drink. You don't solve anything in the program because it's not clinical and then you relapse thinking you need AA which repeats the cycle..
