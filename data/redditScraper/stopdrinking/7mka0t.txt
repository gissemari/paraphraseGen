I'm so sorry to hear you're having a tough time right now. If you are having those thoughts there are a lot of amazing people over on /r/SuicideWatch that are always ready to talk. Please take care :) 
Damn dude... it's okay: just because you relapsed doesn't mean it's over. Hang in there my friend. You can get through this. Imagine how good it'll feel looking back on this in a year or two to see how far you've come.
