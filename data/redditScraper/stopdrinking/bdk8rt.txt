Bought into my own lie that the liter bottle of spirits was going on the home bar just for an occasional drink since I moderated well over the last couple of weeks... hid the bottle instead and sneakily drank all Sunday from lunch until midnight or so. Bottle gone. I don't remember anything after 10:00pm or so. Apparently I did nothing bad... I think I reinstalled windows on a laptop I was setting up (I don't know how exactly but I did) and had sex with my wife...I confessed to her this morning only recalling bits and pieces and what I had done and she claims she didn't even know I was drunk... this is lunacy. I have to stop. Thinking of trying to look over options of checking myself in somewhere but unsure how that would even work with my job...For today I am ashamed tired and terrified of if I went  too far  this time to come back from it cold turkey without consequence. I sit here a shell of a person at my job and just want to shrivel up and cease existing. Why do I do this to my body? Pouring in the poison.....Sorry for the downer post. I will not drink with you today and thank you for being such a wonderful and positive community.

Moderating--been there and done that.  All it did for me was prolong the misery.  It didnt stop me from trying more than once though.  ..I am just the kind of drinker who would never be happy with "one."  No chance.  It was always torture.  I never wanted "just one."  I wanted as many as I felt like having whether it be two three or ten.  ..Self-loathing comes easy when we keep trying (to moderate) and failing at it.  What helped me was finally accepting that this was who I am:  a person that cannot moderate.  That's all and nothing more.  There are zillions of people like that out there.  We are not a colony of lepers ha.   So I can't moderate-big freaking deal.  There's nothing wrong with that at all.  ..Accepting that it was easier for me to then say "well then that's that.  Stop drinking."  No more bargains broken promises mental torture etc.  I found it far more easier and enjoyable to stop drinking than moderating ever was.  ..Try not to beat yourself up.  When you are in a better frame of mind perhaps just ask yourself "Is all this moderation tapering etc. really worth it?  Is there a better alternative?"
I relate to this. I would often black out and people didn't realize. I know it's hard but if you stop today you never have to feel like this again. You are strong and it will be okay one day at a time. I recently heard a quote I love: the best time to grow a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now. You are lucky because you still have now. It's never too late
