*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*...**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**..I'm pledging myself to not drinking today no matter what happens -- good or bad -- and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others...It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours let's not drink alcohol!..**This pledge is a statement of intent.** ..Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink we make a conscious decision *not to drink.* It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!.What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up...**What this is:** ..A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning...**What this isn't:** ..A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread...This post goes up at:..US - Night/Early Morning  ..Europe - Morning  ..Asia and Australia - Evening/Night..A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar...------------------------------------------------------------------------------..&gt; The best thing you can do for your [struggling] friends is to be an example through your own recovery. Your own healing is the greatest message of hope for others.  (Julia Cameron *The Artist's Way)*..**We are looking for someone to take over the Daily Check-In for next week starting on Sunday. It's a great way to do service and to get to know your fellow sobernauts. If you have 30 days or more of sobriety and want to be host for a week please let me know!**

Going to the Atlanta United game this fine Saturday! Off to bed now for some refreshing sober sleep and reminding myself I don't need an overpriced stadium beer to enjoy a fun evening of soccer with my wife. 
Not drinking today...:)))
Checking in on day 252! Got a nice weekend planned - rocking a new album in the car and might take a short road trip with the stuff! Hope everyone here is doing well. Oh! And good afternoon u/quirkyhatgirl.   
Even though some bullshit confederate dickriders are starting shit in my city in the morning I will not drink today .
After months of "just this week-end and then stop" I finally had the strength to prevent myself from taking alcohol yesterday and I also feel motivated to not to for today. Enough with that poison...I won't drink with you today.
Not drinking today! Gonna wake up and have a great day on my weekend off. Loving life again. I wake up welcoming the days as I used to cuss them. What a riot.
Looking forward to not drinking with you awesome folks today! 
I didn't drink this morning I am not drinking on this lovely Saturday afternoon (1.30pm) &amp; I am too content to even think about drinking tonight!!! :) And a wonderful Good morning to the lovely /u/xJToews19   
Not drinking today. 
Laying in bed with my new girlfriend who is 3 years sober. She's sleeping like an angel right now and I couldn't feel more blessed. Everyday that I wake up and do the next right thing I notice small moments of happiness and more that didn't exist while I was drinking. Life is good right now not perfect but good. I will gladly not drink with you all today friends!
I will not drink today

Day 50. The longest Ive gone since age 16. I wouldn't have managed this if I didn't have this sub and you strangers...Feeling very blessed and grateful this morning...I will. Not drink with you today. 
Drinking alcohol is not an option for me today...I will be happy and not drink with you SD...Have a fantastic weekend:)
Keep me sober today!  Grateful to be here.
Lol this is the third Saturday in a roqmw where I woke up before 7 am :D I thought I wasn't a morning person. I won't drink today.
Not drinking with you today...Day 1 again. Very hungover. Disgusted by myself. I need to stop. I made it almost a whole year sober now I can't even make it a month. I hate that I do this to myself over and over. I know its because I'm lonely and bored. I deserve better and so does my family.
Head down ass up- I'm still driving forward sober life  
Badge reset. Today is day 1. Again. I will not drink with you all today.
I will not drink with you today.
Go forth comrades and have one's self a merry weekend. I will not drink with you today.
Ughhhhhh. ..I'm at an acquaintance's birthday party stuck with my boyfriend and people I don't like. Literally everyone is drunk and it's at this amazing bar. I'm almost in tears legit cause everything looks and sounds so good especially cause I've had a really really hard time with depressions and anxiety and have literally nothing to take the edge off. I actually wandered around a liquor store yesterday on the edge of tears...It's hell...I'm not drinking today though. Just.
Good evening all watching an interesting documentary on sports doping with my dude just about to eat dinner. Today has been a great way tp finish off week 7. Not drinking with you all today.
Apparently I have become a morning person...NEVER thought that was possible when I was drinking. Now I'm making coffee in the wee hours. Waking up yet another day NOT HUNGOVER!! I will not drink with you today. 
If I did not drink yesterday then I don't need to today. Have a good weekend. 
I will not drink today. So my sister accepted girlfriend as one of us. She recommended me to practise Pink floyd's comfortably numb solo with guitar so I'll be able to play it for her. I actually started to practise it daily. After all it's not hard to play. 
Day 5 and I made it home yesterday without making my usual Friday night stop after work to stock up for the heavy weekend drinking. Looking forward to a nice relaxing alcohol free weekend full of family time and playing guitar...all with a clearer mind. I will not drink with you today!
I might drink today 
I will not drink today. 
Morning lovely SDers.  Very happy not to drink with you today :-)  getting excited to record 3 weeks sober tomorrow thought it was impossible and couldn't have done it without this sub just being there when I needed it.  Off out with the dogs shortly cold dry starting to smell like autumn. Have a good day all!
It gets harder as you get older when your parents leave after a long visit to say goodbye. Will see them next year I hope. I will not drink over it today. 
Hey SD - I'm not drinking today.
I had a really hard day but I won't make it harder by drinking. 
Good morning all! I won't be drinking with you today!
I will not drink today. 
Friday nights always bring some doubts but waking up refreshed Saturday always helps! 
Hello! May I point out it is *weekend* and I'm up at 5:30? Yes? OK!..I'm up at 5:30 -- no stomach acid no headache no dehydration; just energy and happy to be awake!!..Guess what? .... I'm not drinking with you today
Howdy!  Day 28 feeling great!  I won't be drinking with you tonight!
Not drinking with you fine folks today!
not today.
I will not drink today. I fought long and hard for my sobriety and I'm not about to give it up just yet. Tomorrow will be a different day and I'll deal with it when it comes but I will not drink today.

Camping experiment has begun.  I spent last night in the tent in the back yard...like being a kid again!..Just woke up and came inside for the bathroom etc...Ok so far so good...Tonight I try the real deal.  I have reserved 2 nights at a state park several miles from where I live.  I'll need to pack carefully (well not super carefully...there's a Wal-Mart near the park...) but you get the idea...I got a little Coleman camp stove to make coffee in the mornings...other than that just a cooler and a charcoal grill...I used to do this every now and then when I was growing up...Boy Scouts and all that...and used to go camping with my grandparents (now long gone sadly)...But...stopped doing anything like this when I started drinking heavily 15-20 years ago.  ..So at day 327 I'll finally go out in a woodsy place far away from booze and spend a couple of nights without anything like it.  I guess I could have done this by day 10 or something but I guess I only feel confident now.  Plus it was winter or something for my day 10 right?..So...SD I will not drink today..
I'm not drinking today thanks anyway.
Sober Saturday = sober Sunday morning.  I will not drink today.  Just one day.

Well I'm only on my 3rd day and I've already set plans to drink tonight. I feel like I'm split between 2 worlds right now. When I'm alone I do really great staying sober I have a nice routine set up that I love. But when I know I'm going to be in any situation that isn't professional my first thought is will there be alcohol? And if not I need to get some. ..Tonight I'm supposed to go have "a" beer with some friends. I think it's just going to be too stressful so I think I'm going to make something up so I can stay in. ..Anyways I won't drink with you all today. Any words to keep me in the game today would be much appreciated.
Not drinking today!
Not drinking with y'all today!!!  
Drinking really is poisoning yourself. I will not poison myself today. ..I am not drinking today.

Feeling a little tired today but overall doing great! Working on a new sleep schedule so some days of feeling tired are to come but this should help me stick to my fitness schedule better. Woke up early and got some yoga asana and cardio in now I'm at work and will be here for nearly a full day. After work I am looking forward to some fiddle playing a little art creating of some kind and some family time. I will be drinking lots of tea all day long which is always lovely.

Not today.
It's a beautiful day in Toronto! When it's over there'll have been no drinking! 
Plenty of headlamps or an electric lantern. Baby wipes are good. Drawing a blank...
Not drinking with you all today! :D
I will not drink today no matter what.
Today is day 7.  It's been a long time since I've made it 7 days.  This is the first Fri/Sat that I haven't drank it a very long time.  Yesterday was a challenge because I went to a bar with a friend but I survived.  Today is also going to be a challenge.  5pm Saturday is like the witching hour for me.  I've given up countless times on Saturday.  I have a full day planned to try to avoid it.  .To keep me honest here's what I plan to do: 1. Finally buy groceries. 2. Meal prep two different meals(maybe do one of them tomorrow).  3. Buy lightbulbs. 4. Exercise 12 mins. 5. Meditate 10 mins.  ..Happy sober Saturday everyone!  I won't be drinking with you today! 
I will not drink today! Not today not tonight and not after work no matter how crazy it is!
Not drinking today!
I will not drink today !!!!!
Dear great people of the internet: I will not drink with you today...Thank you for being so wonderfully supportive.

I will not drink today!
I will not drink with you peeps today. 
Sober Saturday pledge
I will not drink with you today.
I'm on day 6 and not drinking today. I had an easy first couple of days but really struggled with not drowning in alcohol after work on Friday. The withdrawals kept me up until 1 am. I woke up to my daughter crying at 6 am and feel infinitely more rested than any amount of sleep I would have gotten after drinking. I feel like I have my entire weekend in front of me to actually do things and be productive. 
Not drinking today! Finally got to go to a crossfit workout with the rest of my derby team since I wasn't hungover and feeling awful! Now just to keep myself busy the rest of the day...
I will not drink with you today.
Not drinking today ladys and gents :)!
Hi everyone! I'm not drinking today; Day 21!  I went out for lunch drank a diet coke &amp; now still stuffed watching tv in the warm &amp; dry. Nice cup of tea for me. I am not drinking with you today!! Take care peeps

I'm going to a wedding tonight AND I WILL NOT DRINK! Stay strong everyone!   
Late to the party and still sober. Intend on keeping it that way today.
Second Saturday night in my adult life not drinking. Something which should've been small went wrong earlier and I'm incredibly irritable. Can't do much exercise with an injury and am now developing cravings. Woe is me.
Been really busy at work today in an office with no windows since 7am drove home had a long walk along the front. It's nearly 9pm here and I definitely won't be drinking today :)
I will not drink today. 
Leaving in a few to spend the weekend with an old friend with whom I've spent countless hours talking and drinking brown liquor. She messaged me this morning and was excited about taking me to a new bar in her neighborhood. I let her know I'm not drinking this weekend and watched the iMessage three dots come and go... Was she going to tell me never mind? ..Nah she just wanted to know what other kinds of beverages I'd like and she was more than happy to hang at the house in the backyard. Cherry lime lacroix FTW!
Sold most of my furniture for a move out of state am scared and stressed but feeling accomplished after staying in bed all yesterday. Productivity and zero hangover from yesterday's pledge! Grateful. I will not be drinking today! 
Got that shiny 2 week badge today and I can honestly say that every aspect of my life is better than it was 2 weeks ago today. I won't drink with you today but I will go see IT and maybe eat some tacos! 
I will not drink today!
Reset to day 1.  Got weak last night like a demon took over. I didn't get wasted but broke my pledge with no apparent triggers.  Maybe some defiant personality disorder.  I'll keep reading Naked Mind and start over. I will not drink alone or with you or anyone today or tonight. I want my self-esteem back!
Checking in. ..so far so good. ..I will not be drinking with you today and I will never drink again and I will never change my mind. ..
IWNDWYT.

Checking in. Not drinking today. 
Still going.  Not drinking today with all of you great folks! 
I will not drink today!
I will not drink today.
What was a Saturday rating somewhere between *meh* and so-so suddenly turned downright ugly. I tell you this dear SD brothers and sisters in arms because I will not use it as an excuse to drink alcohol. No need for me to explain why. We here on SD already know.
Day 1.. Scared for this journey but so ready for it.  I have not and will not drink today.
 
First weekend...pretty rough. :-/..But I'll make it and will not drink with you all today.
I am 29 hours and 43 minutes sober...And I will not drink with y'all today. 
Not drinking today. A little bit depressed/discouraged but alcohol never was the answer and still isn't. ("It's hard to get enough of something that almost works.") Pretty sure I've made it to six months? Let's see what that badge says once I post this...
I will not drink today
I'm not drinking with you today 
Biggest test to date and I passed. New neighbors had us over with just a few other people. That red wine they had out was calling my name. I was feeling awkward and the wine would have been such a nice crutch. The hosts were drinking and it felt weird to leave them hanging. But I opted for ice water and since my mouth was dry it really hit the spot. I know drinking would have gotten out of hand and I would have made an ass out of myself. And when I was most tempted to just pour a small glass even if I could have just had the one I thought about having to do a badge reset and decided it wasn't worth it. Thank you SD!
Just walked with my buddy to my favorite bar then said our goodbyes and walked back home. I had no intention of going into the bar just a beautiful night for a walk...That would if never happened two months ago...I will definitely NOT be drinking with you tonight.
Not drinking with you all today! :) 
Test..
