I was able once to stop drinking for like 6 months. But then I started back and tried to stop again. Then I decided that I never wanted to stop I just wanted to keep the balance (I bet you're all very familiar with this one). But there's no balance there's just me getting wasted one two or three times per week while my whole life downfalls. I feel so sad and angry all the time and I know that most of it is a product from alcohol. I want to stop so badly and I can't... Moments like this one while I'm writing I know what's the right thing to do and I can't avoid drinking but an hour from now I  might turn into someone else and suddenly I don't mind drinking and flush my whole life down the toilet. I was doing great doing some money with some jobs went to university after 8 years without being studying... And now? No university no money of my own (although my father helps me) and I feel like I'm kinda betraying my girlfriend although she's very supportive with my situation. I feel weak stupid I don't know... Lonely... And I'm sure it's all thanks to alcohol because nothing really big changed since the time period I was able to remain sober. And what a great feeling that was...Please... Don't fall for it again... Don't relapse after a long time it's way harder to stop again. And believe me you will want to...Today I try once again. ..Thank you..IWNDWYT

Hey Jimi - you had 6 months of sobriety; you can and will do it again...Were you following any particular path to recovery? Meetings? Counseling?
