The most I can make it  is a week since i stopped 40+ days. The death of my uncle brought up a lot of memories and the stress of personal things have sent me down the rabbit hole. ... I know i need to stop my stomach doesn't feel well again I came into work two hours late one day and stopped working out and started eating like shit again. All the things I was doing well when I stopped drinking have taken a stand still.

What else have you done to support your recovery? Healthy eating and exercise were part of a larger program that helped me get on track.
It's not failure until you give up.  Is there anything that you can identify as to what happens when you relapse?  I.e. when I feel this way I'm at a greater risk to drink?
Do you have a friend you can talk to about it?  It's really helped me to have a friend who is getting sober at the same time as me.  Wouldn't have to be that though just someone you could share the struggle with.
