I relapsed this weekend. I'm so angry at myself. Feeling hopeless. This is so stupid why does it have to be this hard. I'm getting sick of starting over!

Hello /r/R1_02. I am sorry you are struggling. I could not have stayed sober without the help of a therapist and AA. I didn't know how to build a sober happy life on my own. Having support made it easier and more fun to be sober. What do you think would make it easier for you?
&gt; I'm getting sick of starting over!..You say that yet you keep doing it...If you're sick of starting over then stop starting over.  Whether you drink or not is completely within your own control. .
