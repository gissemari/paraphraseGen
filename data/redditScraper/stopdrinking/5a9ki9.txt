I relapsed last night but the more I think about it the more I think it was good for me (I do not at all recommend it). I wanted to test myself and see if I can have a few drinks on a Saturday night and be in control and I failed that test. Before I quit drinking my body was so used to getting completely wasted it was a normal feeling so since I quit I still had this romanticized idea of what being drunk feels like that is now gone. I will admit my night could have went way worse but as soon as I started drinking the alcohol tasted disgusting I tried playing some games on my computer and I couldn't get into that since I was more focused on the drinks I watched TV episodes I had recorded and deleted them but don't really remember what happened in them. Not to mention I had one of the worst hangovers of my life this morning it's currently six pm and I still have a headache. Overall last night is my new memory of what it's like to be drunk and it's terrible. So I did have to reset my badge but my mistake this weekend gave me a whole new outlook on what alcohol really does to you and drinking really is pointless and a waste of time how is it fun to not remember what you did?

I loved the "I wanted to test myself" phase of my alcoholism like I was Thomas Edison. 
I relapsed hard after 3 months last time. I honestly think it was one of the best things for my long term sobriety. ..Now whenever I do start to romanticize it I always remember exactly how bad that relapse was and how much pain I caused myself. It has helped steel me thoughout this attempt.
