Made it to 1 month for the second time ever feels good. Still struggling with stress and anxiety but I had an epiphany reading a comment the other day which summarized plenty of other ways that you can deal with these issues without drinking. The difference in mental clarity in just 4 weeks is really noticeable though - thanks SD!.

Congrats!  Keep up the good work! 
Whoop! Good job. I thought those first few weeks were the hardest part. Keep it up!
Congrats!!! Nice looking star you got. I will not drink with you today. 
Good for you.  I recently did 25 days and was so surprised by how clearly I was able to think and focus.  Then thought I could drink moderately.  Well I know now I can't.  
I found the first 30 the hardest congrats! 
Congratulations! 30 days is hard! Keep doing what you're doing. Peace and good vibes to you.
