I've been lurking for awhile here there and elsewhere and finally decided to make a new account to vent some of my thoughts. I'm not sure if I'm looking for advice confirmation or what but I do know writing things out usually helps...I really enjoy alcohol. I like how it makes me feel I enjoy drinking alone and with friends I love the craft beer scene etc. My drinking habits in my younger 20's was pretty typical but definitely picked up during my 3rd year teaching (I was completely and utterly miserable at my job). I kept myself to 3 glasses of wine most nights stopping there so as to not feel bad the next day...Since then and since quitting my job I still have a drink almost every night. Sometimes it's one drink a couple of beers or a bottle of wine. Weekends I drink more. I keep my drinking to the evening (unless I go to a brewery or something on the weekend). I have a higher tolerance and typically don't deal with any negative consequences from drinking. I'm a happy drinker don't black out and am pretty responsible with my drinking. ..My issue here is...It seems like I drink a lot. I realize that this may very well be a habit and that often this amount of drinking could turn into more (read this so many times here). But I feel like I need to figure out my WHY - why I should make changes. I'm health conscious and am in pretty good shape but drinking is definitely keeping on some extra weight. I struggle with guilt body checking and intrusive thoughts about my weight and because of this have tried not to make booze about weight gain - this just leads to major guilt. I try not to feel guilty about "naughty" food in the same way. ..I don't want to quite drinking completely but clearly I'm thinking I should drink less. How do I find a balance in my head to motivate me to make some changes in my habits? How do I find the right amount of leverage in my mind to keep me motivated? I know I'd be saving money and taking care of my body if I drank less but why hasn't this alone been enough motivation?..Sorry for rambling. I'll continue to lurk!

Only you can figure out why. We each have our own individual answer to that question. I had to want to quit before I quit. I did not black out drive drunk get in any trouble either but knew I drank to much also. You have to really want to do something I think before you will. IWNDWYT
