Hey everyone. I don't nor have I ever had a drinking problem but I do struggle with anxiety like many of you on here. What has worked best for your anxiety...an SSRI/SNRI antidepressant or Gabapentin? Thanks :)

I've been on SSRI's for years which help a lot but I still occasionally have trouble. I've found that phenibut works for me to take whenever I need something extra.
Lexapro but it took a few weeks to work and seemed to increase anxiety at the beginning. I had panic attacks and was scared to drive leave the house etc. Lexapro has saved me! Not everyone has the same results but there are a lot of different SSRIs and new ones available. Usually something will work. I read books and went to therapy but in my opinion Lexapro is what finally worked for me.
I'm taking gabapentin currently but just during withdrawal phase. I find it super helpful with the symptoms and the extra anxiety. But I still have my normal anxiety level lol.
I took both when I first quit: gabapentin for six months (cravings anxiety) and a low dose of an SSRI which I still take just for anxiety. It worked beautifully for me.
Magnesium oxide works for anxiety also but without all the side-effects.
Meditation has had more of an impact than anything for me. There's research behind it. MRIs have shown shrinkage of the amygdala (the primitive brain structure responsible for the "fight or flight" response) in people that have been mediating daily for 8 weeks.    .    .It has changed my life.
My Doc told me my Lexapro wouldn't work right while I was drinking.  I stopped drinking and my anxiety cleared and then I weaned off Lexapro.
