I've relapsed so many times that the thought of actually becoming a normal functioning member of society seems like an impossibility. Or it frightens me. The amount of work it'll take I don't know if I can ever make it there...Those of you who have struggled for years and found a way back to society. How did you do it? I know about AA and the 10 steps or whatever. I wanna know how you got into your head though and convinced yourself to keep going. What was the mental process.

&gt; *I know about AA and the 10 steps or whatever.*..Um. It doesn't sound like you do know about it...&gt; *I wanna know how you got into your head though and convinced yourself to keep going.* ..I got arrested for public intoxication. I learned that it was exceedingly difficult for me to limit myself to two or three drinks  .and I learned that I would rather have zero drinks than two or three drinks...Since I didn't want to be a drunk  .and I didn't want to be irritated all the time  .I choose not to drink...And I choose to participate in AA and the twelve steps.
I'm at day 46 so take everything I saw with a bottle of salt. Lord knows I'm a chronic relapser. This IS the longer I've gone in about 3 years though i think. ..December 27th I woke up so sick I'm pretty sure I had a mini stroke my brain was not functioning the way it should be. I was extremely confused and had to mentallyl talk myself through each task i was doing. "Ok grab pants put right leg in left leg in...shit I forgot underwear..." Etc it was crazy. I had been wanting to quit for  a long time but kept just going and getting alcohol time and time again. This time I was just done so sick and tired of being sick and tired. I found a gust of energy in the hatred i had for myself. I didn't do it alone though i started taking Kratom and it helped and has been helping me daily. I've also packed my schedule. I'm working a lot more i go to gymnastics corssfit and I say yes to any invite i get. ..I'm not sure if that helps but just try to focus on how awesome being a normal person is. Everything is exciting to me right now. Driving sober? Awesome. Not hating everydaay at work! Awesome. Working out and feeling good about myself and not selfloathing. Awesome...Good luck I won't drink with you today.
