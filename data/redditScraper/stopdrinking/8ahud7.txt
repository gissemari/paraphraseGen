Feel like hell. Struggled hard starting in the afternoon with cravings. I caved in and bought some wine on my way home. Had a few glasses then went out with some people. The sad part is that I don't even enjoy drinking anymore. It just makes me feel lousy from start to finish. I do stupid shit and say stupid things. I make horrible fucking choices. My last slip. I will not be doing this anymore. There's nothing ok about it. What's awesome is being sober. Sobriety is a gift every single day. I will not be drinking with you all today.

&gt; *I don't even enjoy drinking anymore.* ..Isn't that the truth. And still we do it...Crazy.
I know how frustrating it can be to know you want to quit but find yourself falling back to alcohol again and again. I will not drink with you today. 
Hopefully now you have enough disappointment under your belt that sobriety will win the next time you make a choice to drink or not   Iwndwyt
