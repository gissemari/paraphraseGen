I've been sober for over 8 months. For the first time in quite a while I'm struggling. We have company staying with us and it's overwhelming. I need my space but I have no way to get any. My company is hopefully leaving tomorrow assuming they're done with avalanche control on the highway passes but I don't know how I'm going to last that long. My wife helps keep me grounded and she acts as a buffer to make things easier on me but fuck this time is hard. I'm not really looking for advice or anything... I just needed a place to vent. Sorry in advance for such a pointless post. Stay sober everyone!

Vent away!!!! I won't drink with you!!
Not pointless.  I so get you on the need for space.  I so hope your company bugs out tomorrow and you get back to yourself and your own space.
You made it this far I think you can make it further. :)
Hmmmm.... looks like you tend to be introvert? I have a tendency to be stressed with people under certain conditions too. I just want my own space you people! Give me peace! Keep venting my friend and iwndwyt.
Venting is a very solid remedy to ease the mind
Can you lock yourself in the bathroom and take a hot bath while watching an anti-anxiety video on youtube and drinking tea? I'd excuse myself for an hour and breathe. Hang in there!
You've done great it looks like over 8 months-- wow. I am a complete introvert and understand your need for space 100%. Sending hugs (but from my own house- a safe long distance away- lol). Hope you get some alone time soon. :)
In my situation i sometimes just lay on my bed with the door closed and nap or read.  It doesn't bother me if people think it's rude it's for my sanity.  If they can't handle my introvert needs it's not my problem.  I do it politely it works for me.      I will not be drinking with you today friend
