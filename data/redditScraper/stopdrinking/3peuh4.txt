it took me a lot of tries to get to this point. at the end of today i'll have 51 days of sobriety. i used to make a new reddit account every time i made a new attempt and with it a new badge. i would inevitably last about 2 days then i would just abandon the account. i actually remember JimBeamsHusband commenting on in a badge message that my sober day was the same day as my username the first time i did that. that was about 2 years ago. ..i'm feeling frustrated because i'm having the same issue with exercising. i put on 50 pounds since february. i go through these cycles with all the crutches i have in my life. the first 4 days are hell the next two weeks after that are still hard and then after that i barely think about it. ..and then of course it's just so fucking easy to relapse. if i get lazy with dieting for one day i go in a tailspin and end up where i am now. if i drank i would be right back where i was when i quit. ..anyway i can do it and i will do it. it's fucking hard in the beginning but it's very doable. to all you folks in the early days - just fight as hard as you can. you can do it. hell i'm still in the early days.

You know what I love about your posts 201? You seem to be having the roughest times at times but You Are Not Letting Go. You've got this belief and this hope that everything you're putting into your sobriety is going to come back to you in multitudes and I really believe it will. I see someone that is determined and tenacious for what they want. Those people often get exactly what they're after. I look forward to your next share :)
Half-a-century numbers!  Hooray!  You got a running start now.
You've got some tenacity I admire that. Well done.
