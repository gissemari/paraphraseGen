Some days it's just not easy some nights it's really hard...I live above a pub sometimes when there's live music on and it's a hot night I can imagine drinking a brew and enjoying the music...I know that the music sucks the beer makes me anxious and heat can be beaten with water but I really need strength tonight...I'm trying to go for a promotion work is hell and I'm just too exhausted to keep up the fight tonight. I'm always worse when I'm tired and lonely...Please remind why I'm staying sober because it just feels like I'm torturing myself....

I try to stay sober for a better life. My drinking caused a lot of pain in my life the effects of that have hurt other people in my life. I don't want to love that way anymore..
Sounds like an early bedtime might be in order! You can ride this out. Stay strong  
ride it out! the feeling in the morning of not having given in is priceless! ..iwndwyt ..Sands
Just keep coming back.
I'm over here after breaking a 10 day run sick ashamed frankly I'm scared feel like crying but can't and I wrecked my truck last night into a small tree.  In one session I just created a lot of problems.  Luckily no DUI yet.  I afraid I'm too messed up to ever live a sane existence.  I'm afraid of hurting other people.  I'm sad I've hurt so many relationships.  Please don't come back to where I'm at.  This is a hell im living through.  Alcohol does nothing positive.
Stay strong! Sobriety let me live life again instead of existing for the bottle in a nightmare world of pain.  That's my reason why...You can do this! I'm rooting for you! IWNDWYT 
IWNDWYT.   Exploring the option of finding a new place to live may benefit you.  Stay strong.
