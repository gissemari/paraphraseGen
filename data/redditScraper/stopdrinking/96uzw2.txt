So I've been struggling to stop drinking for awhile. I've just recently admitted how hard it is for me to control myself when I start drinking. It's very hard to be satisfied with just 1 or 2 and it almost always turns into 6 or 10. I don't need to slow down I need to stop. You all know this you all have heard this. I just wonder how long I'm going to make it this time. I can't say that "I plan to stop for life" or that "I'll never drink again" but I do want to make it at least one month. After that we'll see. For now I just have to make it today.

I'm not an AA person (although I've gone to some meetings) but I ascribe to  one day at a time .
