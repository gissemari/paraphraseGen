I haven't been able to eat for three weeks now \(every time I try I just can't force myself to swallow for some reason\) and I haven't been able to keep food down for about two weeks.  The doctor said I have alcoholic ketoacidosis but released me as long as I promised that I'll go to my rehab setup appointment in two weeks and will remain sober until then \(I had to fight him really hard to have him let me go\-\-I told him I can't afford rehab if I miss work between now and then which is absolutely true\).  ..I still haven't been able to eat but I haven't thrown up since he gave me some fluids.  I just don't know if I'll be able to do it alone before going to rehab... but alcoholic ketoacidosis sounds scary too \(a quick google search says it can lead to death???\).  I'm trying to stay sober until then because I'm scared of what might happen but I'm really scared that I won't be able to do this without relapsing and I don't know what will happen if I don't fix my body.  How bad of shape am I in??  Any tips for a newcomer?

Probably best to talk to your doctor again if you can. ..Sorry it is tough for you right now.
