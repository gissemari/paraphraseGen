I play music in my church on Sunday mornings. Daylight saving used to be such an anxiety farm for me because I needed to balance the time change and waking up super early to be at the church before people with my binge drinking the night before. I wasn't just NOT going to binge drink. So those mornings were absolute hell for me. Today however is very different. I worked a late shift last night got 4 hours of sleep woke up early to practice my music again and I'm at church serving and feeling great! A little tired but I'll take that over bloated miserable and depressed any day. I'm so thankful for sobriety! If you're struggling keep it up. You don't even realize how many rewards there are. They just keep popping up the longer you go and you find out new ways that alcohol was limiting you. Amazing. You can do it!!

I have to disagree I just posted about how much I loathe DST lol...But way to go this time around! :)
The rewards keep popping up that you don't even realize existed- I can relate to this so much. Off the top of my head I can think of... my hair looks so much healthier and that surprised me. Not only more money from less spent on booze but ALSO less spent on stupid shit I would purchase while drunk- just smarter with money all around. Better in conversation and with my social skills- that surprised the hell out of me. Thanks for sharing your post resonates with me! IWNDWYT...PS I was surprised how much feeling tired feels like a hangover. Now when I don't get much sleep I get "hangover flashbacks" if that makes sense.
