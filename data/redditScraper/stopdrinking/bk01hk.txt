Just wanted to get this out there if only for me to look at it the next time I'm feeling like giving in to a craving of any kind. Drunk for about 10 years sober about 10 months last year from end of January until around end of November before I had a "small" relapse. Everything was going great life was looking up. Not sure what happened. Got sober after my wife left me and did the whole lose weight get new hobbies thing all while finalizing the divorce. Point is I decided to try to pick a "less addictive" substance to handle life with something that could take the edge off. Long story short I spent from the end of this February until Last Thursday on an escalating bender ending with me overdosing last week. Nothing like waking up from the dead in a hospital surrounded by paramedics security nurses and doctors. I never thought I would be that person but it happened. I figured since it wasn't alcohol I was ok but I used all the rationalizations I developed to keep drinking to keep using. I feel very embarrassed to be learning this again but I know this time the only way I will stay sober from everything is if I build a life worth living. It's hard to think about all the hard work I threw away but hopefully it's easier this time around. Here's to quitting for the N+1th time. It's worth it sometimes I guess we need reminders. Learning to love myself or forgive myself is what I think my biggest hurdle is at the moment. Also as an aside the book Never Enough has put things in great perspective in addition to of course The Naked Mind. Good luck to all of you on whatever part of your life's journey you are. Thanks for reading and I will not use drugs to escape with you today.

I went through a period where I substituted with drugs as well. I was just not comfortable being in my own skin. Ive been working on my sobriety for a long time now and I'm finally at the point where being sober is where I am most comfortable...I dont even take benadryl because it alters my natural state. I was sceptical for a long time that sobriety would ever fully click but I knew ultimately it was what I wanted out of life. ..I've bandaged my addictions countless times only to discover once I ripped it off that I was still wounded. ..Being vulnerable in sobriety has taught me that I have incredible strength. Being an active member in the group has taught me that I am not alone and have a wonderful bunch of folks here to lend me strength when I'm feeling weak...You're not alone and we are here for you...IWNDWYT .B.
