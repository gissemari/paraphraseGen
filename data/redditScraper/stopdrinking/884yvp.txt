I think this is the longest I haven't drank in four years. It's the little things at first. Not sweating out all the time not spending half the day in the bathroom. I'm grateful for the changes. Having had years of sobriety and relapsing today I feel a shift. Having my liver starting to show signs of damage was a wake up call. I'm 46 and would like to be around for a while. There's so much good in life! Today I feel joy! I guess I'll rest in that and not worry about tomorrow.

Funny how the benefits come so quickly eh? I'm on day 4 today can't wait to see how I'll be feeling tomorrow. Keep it up!..IWNDWYT
Thanks brother. Here's to a good tomorrow!
Great to hear!  One day at a time.  Feel joy tomorrow too.  You can do this and good luck to you :)
Right - don't worry about tomorrow and keep checking in here.  I do and it has made a huge difference to me.  The people here are so supportive!  "Today I feel joy!"  I love that!
Oh the sweating seriously my first 2 nights I sweat nonstop and it was a toxic sweat. After those 2 nights my bedroom smelled of death. Congrats on making it through the nasty part 
Thanks for your honesty. I'm going to try to spend as much time outside tomorrow as I can. Getting a good hour of exercise seems to help. I've also eaten way too much ice cream tonight..I'm in a pretty good mindset too. Getting through the weekend with good sleep and no hangovers would be a real gift..I am new to this Reddit thing. I'm pretty amazed at the community that's here. I think it sure helps to be able to share the journey..Just curious where do you live? I'm in Colorado.
I'll say the physical benefits come back quicker the shorter the amount of time of drinking. The psychological impact seems about the same as clarity regret anxiety are concerned. Congrats on 3 days!
