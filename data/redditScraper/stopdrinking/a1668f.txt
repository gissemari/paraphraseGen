Dealing with loneliness and feeling a void is quite hard at the moment to be honest. I've got no cravings but I'm a bit struggling with some negative feelings. It's a loneliness inside myself I have some people to reach out to will do that later today. It's just the feeling of emptiness sometimes. I used to wash it "away" with alcohol. Now it's there in it's raw self. I know it's a part of being sober. Trying to apply all the tools I've got at the moment just having a bad day I guess. Life...It's just blegh sometimes. Maybe tomorrow will be a better day. Just wanted to write it down. Maybe it helps. Rant over. IWNDWYT

Hi Cato.  A friendly hello today.  There will be days like this but luckily now it won't be a lifetime entirely built of these days hey?  I'll share a bittersweet coffee this morning    have I told you lately how good it is to see you here?  It is a fact.. it is very good to have you here.  Iwndwyt  
The Lonely City is a good read for times like this. If you're into reading.
I feel ya on that. At first it was nice to distance myself from the people I always drank with but they were also my only friends. Making new friends as a sober person seems to be difficult and the loneliness has been getting to me lately...I think with more time we will be able to create better friendships and relationships with people. But for now loneliness is part of things :/
