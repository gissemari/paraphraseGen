I've resisted posting all day because I didn't want the accountability. I'm here though. I'm focusing on what I'm trying to avoid by wanting to drink. I think I'm out of the woods now. Thanks SD for keeping me honest.

Stay strong friend! We're here for you.
I just got back from a long motorcycle ride and I won't drink with you. But ya I thought about it. But it only leads to bad things.
Try yo "play it forward".... Good luck!
Good to see you here.  I went back and read some of your earlier posts.  Inspiring!!! Very glad you are out of the woods.  I intend to not drink with you tomorrow but will say it officially in the morning.  I wish you a good evening.
I'm so glad you're posting this. Total accountability - woohoo!! If you can go to sleep that may be a good bet; it will get you through. 94 days is fantastic!! You put hard work into this time and I'm proud for you friend :) Hang in there and please post in the morning..I'm cheering for you!!

i was in *THAT* place moments before my last relapse. The only thing different  is that i literally did not know how to get out of my mind to get here and post....so thank you for sharing this because it will help me in the future!..go you you're awesome !!!!
Good job! You can get through this. Posting here is action and it is showing what you really want. I know a part of you(and me) want to have a drink sometimes that's okay. But we both know that it's just not worth it and life is actually a whole lot better if we don't ever drink. There is a BIG difference between thinking of doing something and actually doing it. But I would suggest to really kill those thoughts of drinking when you get them. I always think of all the bad things that come with drinking and that usually calms me down. Good luck..
