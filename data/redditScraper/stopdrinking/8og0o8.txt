I have not apologized to my wife yet as im still struggling with how much I hated her over the last two years for still loving and caring for me. I feel unworthy still to even say im sorry.  Looking back I wanted her to just divorce me and let me drift away to nothingness. She reminded me the other day how often I would say " I don't care if I live anymore". I remember saying that often. Im still uncovering feelings and emotions. At some point I'll uncover myself and be able to forgive myself enough to say im sorry to this amazing woman who saved me and my family.

Perhaps it's not about whether you feel unworthy to say sorry to her; maybe it's about the fact that she deserves an apology . Apologising will also draw a line under that bad period of your relationship. It's done now and by recognising that you hurt her and apologising you can both move onto the  next awesome stage of your marriage. It takes a big person to apologise; be that person ! IWNDWYT 
It took me years to apologize to some of the people closest to me. It takes time to heal but don't let the opportunity slip away. I'm sure she'd love to hear that! I try to live that apology by committing to not drinking today. Sometimes that's the best I can do but do it I will.
Recovery is a process it takes time fix yourself first \- the rest will follow.
