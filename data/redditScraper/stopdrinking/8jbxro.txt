I obviously am an alcoholic at one point I was drinking half a handle of vodka a day. Sometimes even a bit more. I would wake up and couldn't remember what I had for lunch or dinner the day before. So it had to stop. My liver was so damaged I was hospitalized (although half of that was because the medications I take nearly all have liver damage as a side effect.)..So I started to taper off slowly. I got down from 750 ml to 300 and then maybe 200 ml. I got bold and went to 100 and then 50 ml too quickly. I ended up having seizures and went into the ER last week. I had the DTs so bad they put towels on the railings of my bed in case the seizures got really bad. I had an EKG Monitor that was mobile on me at all times in case I went into cardiac arrest it would notify the transponder in my room to the nurse station. I couldn't even be transported 3 floors up without a nurse or EMT present lest I have a heart attack during transport...Withdrawals weren't as bad when I tried to quit on my own which could have killed me (NEVER GO COLD TURKEY OUTSIDE OF A HOSPITAL! You can die even if you are any otherwise healthy young person!)..So I get out after 2 days which isn't full detox and I get the DTs again and start drinking again to make it stop. Pathetic...So I've dumped all the booze in my house and will be going back to the ER for a full detox of about 4 days. It's going to suck because they won't let you eat anything but beef bullion soup and lemonade. They give you Ativan so you won't have seizures but expect to be woken up every 2 hours and have a bunch of EKG pads stuck to your chest...Wish me luck. Hopefully I come out on the other end all good. Never go cold turkey outside a hospital; your life depends on it.

Lucky for me that when I made the decision to stop drinking I let some true friends of mine know about it. I was about 24 hours into the ordeal when they showed up at my house w/booze. They did not insist that I drink but related to me stories of two others in their lives who had died from going cold turkey. I spent (with their help) almost a month slowly cutting back on amounts of liquor consumed each day. Lucky (again) for me the cut down process ended with intake day to a 28 day rehab program. I am now on day 49 sober and feel better than I have in a decade or more. Good luck keep the faith...things certainly are getting better for me. Peace
