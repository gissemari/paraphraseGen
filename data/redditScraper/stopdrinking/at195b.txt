I've had very serious issues with alcohol for twenty years..Whenever I relapse friends and family expect an instant plan and to be immediately well again..Does anyone else feel the same intensity?.Everything always seems to happen at once.  A week on Monday I have to start a new job and today I've still got the 'Fears' and can't sleep..I just want all of this to go away

I think you just got yourself some breathing space and energy for the new job by not drinking. Things I dreaded still become easier and easier in my job since I stopped drinking and people notice it more and more...Anyway good luck and congratulations on 4 days!
I know what you're talking about.  it sucks
