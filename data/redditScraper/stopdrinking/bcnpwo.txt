I'm 44 in a few weeks and struggle with drinking. I have actually been reducing for some weeks now as a 700ml bottle of vodka would often pretty much go in a night. I moved from vodka to wine then wine to beer to lesser strength beer. The only think that happens is I take longer to get drunk but always subconsciously aim for that goal. I lost a parent who died in front of me and have suffered depression since really. I lost my driving license this year as I was stopped driving under the influence which wasn't my proudest moment and did manage a few days without alcohol a few weeks back but keep slipping. I guess I know drinking is bad but could use some stories of successes to fire me up as when I stop drinking is very much on my mind. I've got 10 beers in the fridge I'm going to remove and put in my shed and a slug if vodka which I'm now going to pour away. I'm quite I intelligent and have a good work ethic and thought I was good at hiding my drinking but as I'm slowing down I am unsure I ever truly was able to fully hide it.
