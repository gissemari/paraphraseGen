Kinda odd. Friday night was my first night home alone. SO was out with her job - first for a bow and arrow session then dinner - meaning I had to spend the evening early night on my own. And my brain had been working overtime on the subject all week telling me this is it (Mind you there's still 1  bottle of scotch readily available on the shelf in the kitchen that's been there for the ride): "You will fail. How will you resist a solid drink after cooking and eating your sirloin your mashed potatoes and your mushroom gravy?". So I was actually very nervous - turns out my brain was playing tricks on me. After dinner cleaned the pots pans and dishes. Had a long phone conversation with an old friend (whom btw. was drunk off his ass at the time :) ) - but I never gave the bottles a second thougth. I had my tea and Ben & Jerrys while watching first Top Gear then Transformers: Age of Extinction (quite good actually) - and went to  bed with the SO when she got home at around 0045 (sober I must add - thank you honey)....Just rambling but quite happy!

Great NDV !  Sober On!
Well done!!
My wife was out of town last weekend. All by myself with four days off. Very nervous but able to stay busy and remain sober. You did it with a bottle of liquor within reach! Holy cow! My hats of to you. I won't drink with you today.
