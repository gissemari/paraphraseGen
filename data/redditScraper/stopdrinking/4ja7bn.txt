I had my first month sober back in March after 15 years of drinking. Tonight is back to day 1 being sober. I hope the withdrawals aren't as severe this time around since I was sober for a month before relapsing for a month. Please? Anyone? I just went through this and I'm not sure I'm strong enough to handle the withdrawals again so soon...I couldn't sleep for several weeks the first time I went sober. The worst thing is that I was starting to sleep and feel better after a month which is when my girlfriend left. I had to get drunk just that one night which has now continued into mid May. It just took one moment of weakness and now withdrawal hell again...I'll just be on Reddit for at least the he next week eating melatonin and lying down without sleeping.

Welcome back :) So lets talk plans! What are you going to try and do different this time to get back on track?  
When I was around a month sober and my mind started clearing I started to remember why I began drinking all those years ago. Once the fog of drinking started to clear I saw my old friend depression right underneath. I started on a new antidepressant which I why I'm motivated to stop again right now. And I'm starting to face that issue. They're both so interconnected now...I know I can't drink and have any hope of depression meds working. This feels like I'm getting double-teamed and it's not a fair fight. I'm just going to grind out this week and hope the meds kick in soon. I was just approved for TMS therapy as well. Honestly I can't execute any plan right now when simply taking a shower is an ordeal.
Glad you're here!  What is your plan moving forward.  What can you share about what you learned so that others might benefit...You've done some important research.
