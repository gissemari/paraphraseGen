Hey SD..Just curious: how do you typically handle telling new people about your non-drinker status without making it a big deal or making things awkward?.I've recently dipped my foot back into the dating scene and it's a bit intimidating to say the least -- especially now that I don't have my liquid-courage/anxiety-easer..Although I don't have issues with wanting to drink on first dates (or subsequent ones) I *am* struggling a bit recently with how to communicate my sobriety to potential dating partners without being a buzzkill or shooting myself in the foot..As an example: a girl who I went on two successful coffee dates with just suggested another date via text. Great right? However "I wanted to try some summer wines. Maybe I'll bring a couple bottles over for us to try?" was her suggestion. I went ahead and told her that sounds lovely but that full disclosure I don't really drink these days -- and that I absolutely don't mind when others do..She has yet to respond so now of course I'm doubting my response/approach..So basically...what I'm saying (long-windedly) is: I don't want to give someone an earful about my being sober (that they likely don't even care about) but I also don't want to hide anything or mislead anyone..Any hot tips for this over-thinker? TIA.

In my experience true normies have not a second thought when I tell them I don't drink. i.e. they are NOT over-thinking it. If someone is put off by that fact they are A) boring if they can't imagine doing something non-alcohol related for a date B) trying to take advantage of you in some way instead of a true date or C) also an alcoholic/problem drinker/substance abuser who's going to still be A) boring and probably sloppy and who wants to babysit? My husband is a normie and he just honestly. doesn't. think. about. alcohol. I told him early on I didn't drink so he's never offered me a drink or suggested an alcohol activity. He didn't pout he didn't think about it just moved on...When I was online dating I put it in my profile. If someone offered to bring a bottle over I would say "I don't drink but you are welcome to." If someone offers me a drink at a bar I say "Thanks I'll have a Coke." It's not an apology or an explanation. So I don't treat it as such. It's just a fact. Anyone who has a joke or a response or a question or ghosts me I don't fuck with. Period. Life's too short man. I'm not on this planet to explain my choices or make closet alcoholics feel better. Sorry not sorry.
I met my wife to be when I was sober and she was drinking (more or less normally)...  I lasted another 4 years before I joined her. ..Over the next 20 years we both developed a pretty much daily drinking habit and now that I've quit and she's continued it has become really clear to me just how much I don't enjoy being around her when she's drunk or even buzzed...So if I ever find myself dating I hope I will have the strength to be honest not only about my sobriety but also my distaste for drinkers  and then walk away if the other person is not on the same page...I just don't ever want to subject myself again to the temptation to join in and/or enduring their potential spiral into alcoholism.
