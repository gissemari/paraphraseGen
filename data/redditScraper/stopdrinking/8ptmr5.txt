Welcome. IWNDWYT 
Reading posts on here are great to motivate and keep you on track but it might help you to focus on something else for a while. Even if it's just a short walk or reading a chapter of something you enjoy getting outside of your head can make you feel less worried about this. At least for me. It's tough to strike a balance between being vigilant against the temptations but also not over-thinking about isn't it?
