Today was a non-stop sequence of situations in which I used to drink...  I'm on vacation with my in-laws and wife and the day consisted of a tiki bar next to the water for lunch waiting at the restaurant bar until the table for dinner was ready a blues club and a lovely dip in the pool. ..Last year I would have started with a few drinks before lunch and then a couple more at each next place adding up to 8-10 but proudly lying to myself that I'm still very "functional" because no one can tell. Then when we got back to my in-laws house I would have waited anxiously until everyone was asleep so I could hunt down a bottle of something to have 4-8 gulps of and fall into blackout sleep. Then I'd be miserable for walking 18 holes of golf tomorrow morning and struggle to make awkward conversation with my father in law before having a beer after the round was over and starting it all over again. ..But I didn't drink at all today just ate a crazy amount of food and drank my ice water and diet coke and polar and tried to just enjoy the scenery and serenity of the ocean. Now everyone is asleep but instead of finding a bottle I'm sipping the herbal tea I brought with me from home. The conversation with my father in law tomorrow will still be a struggle but the golf will be fun and I'll feel so much better able to handle it all with so much less anxiety..
