Spider Robinson said "Context is everything. Breast Feeding is beneficial to an infant but to an elderly cardiac patient it can be fatal". Looking at someone else struggle with a problem you've had is much the same way. You get to understand the view others had of you while you were in the situation. Sometimes that view isn't pretty and leaves you with a lot of regrets. Me I've got 21 years of them and I look back and am sorry I put everyone through the things I did. Day 1010...Right now I've got a friend who is deep in the hold of the devil in the bottle I've suggested we go to meetings (and I don't even like meetings) to try to help him but it has all been for naught.  Right now he's got an IV drip as they try to bring him back down from his last jump off the wagon.  ..It lets me see the shit I put my own wife friends and family through.  It lets me see their context something of which I never had.  ..Man I was a dick.  He's not but I know I was...Heaven help get him through this cause he needs some help right now.

That sucks.  I'm really sorry.  I hope your friend will one day find peace...I can't dwell on what I did what I said how I acted because it would drive me crazy.  I let my actions now help make amends for my actions then.  It's all I can do really.
