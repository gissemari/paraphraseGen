Been sober since December and thought I was doing so good. My wife and I took a trip to Vegas over the weekend and I ended up "trying" to drink. Ended up blacking out several times and we missed our flight home because I was too hungover/anxious to get on the plane. ..I have a 7 month old daughter and a new rewarding career that I jeopardized by drinking. I guess it's time to start over again. Just feel so down and worried about stay sober now.

Hey there.  Your post was caught in the spam queue - sorry it's being posted so late...Welcome back. The chance to try again is such a gift. You've done it before and you can most assuredly do it again. Glad you're here.
Continuing exploring your lessons learned develop a plan to keep sobriety front of mind and move forward. People make mistakes and it's growing from them into a wiser person that counts most. Your daughter is terrific motivation. :-)
It could happen to any of us if what I've learned here on SD holds true. You spent most of the past year without drinking however and that's still quite a thing to be proud of. ..I'm genuinely curious about the thinking that led up to the relapse if you'd care to share. But I'm glad you're among us.
This time I am trying every recovery method I can think of. Focusing mainly on an outpatient program as it's pretty exhausting...and absolutely terrific! I am learning so many relapse prevention techniques. Also a therapist. I would never consider any of these things in the past. Too stubborn for my own good!
