I'm struggling to find a routine Didn't particularly feel like drinking today but did feel like shouting and or/crying (which in time would probably have led to a blow out) Pizza seems to help. Any other ideas to get through the first few days? ..IWNDWYT

Well done on the 1st day!!!!..Sugary drinks and sweets in general really comforted me...I also spent the 1st few days eating really easy to digest comfort food like mashed potatoes bananas porridge........I also started to take a B complex vitamin daily which I've heard really helps with physical recovery and helps with the overall vitamin depletion drinking causes...I loved the book   The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober   by Catherine Gray.........my attention span was shot to pieces in the 1st few weeks but I found this so easy to read and really well written...Wishing you all the luck in the world!. 
Just let go and eat whatever the hell u want
I sat in meetings in the evening to keep from caving. IWNDWYT 
Of course day 2 is hard. Getting sober is one thing staying sober even harder. That's why I got all the help  I could find. I started by getting a therapist. AA meetings filled empty time and put me in touch with people who understand and gave me hope.
