Four months it seems unreal and yet so very real at the same time. It took me a long time to get here in fact it took me a long time to get more than a handful of weeks. Nothing spectacular happened four months ago to make this time different. Maybe I embarrassed myself a little more than usual but nothing I wouldn't soon get over. If I did have a light bulb moment it was a pretty simple one: if I want to not drink then drinking is the one thing I have to not do no matter what...Finding what I needed to do to get through "no matter what" was the important part. For me that included a whole lot of white knuckles doing things I didn't particularly enjoy or want to do in order to keep busy and reading / posting here a lot. I've learned a lot of tools from this sub and use them. As time goes on it gets easier and different. My struggles today are not the same as four months ago I have to remember to stay vigilant...Thank you from the bottom of my heart to everyone here at SD <3 This sub has made me believe that this can be possible for me. There will be ice cream had this evening for sure :) Sober on sober people!
