Hi everyone! Yesterday was day 40 out of the [90 days of goals I set to kick-start my sobriety.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2ykia8/day_2890_report/cpamtjj)..My four goals are:..1. See a therapist weekly and do the "homework" she assigns. ..2. Answer my phone appropriately and use it to reach out to people in my sober support networks...3. Post here daily...4. Attend a support group meeting daily...Yesterday started benignly enough. I got up early to get to work on some chores and catch-up tasks. I was able to talk to someone I've been working with about an issue that's been bugging me. Instead of just shoving down my feelings when the issue came up again I told him what I was thinking and we talked it over. ..It's finally sunny here. My memory is improving   I remembered things I needed at the grocery store without even making a list. I was at 40 days and feeling good...I went to the meeting that I'd arranged to meet a sober friend at. It was supposed to be a big book meeting but the group conscience decided to make it a first step meeting instead after it became apparent that one of the other newcomers had less than 24 hours of sobriety...The chair gave a lead on his experience getting sober and finding AA. Then we all went around the room and shared. I shared my experience of struggling with relapse etc. and how that has all changed since I started going to a meeting daily and working on my recovery. I honestly haven't had a single desire to drink for the last forty days and I shared that...The next person to share was an oldtimer who felt the need to tell me that he'd been sober twenty years and he still had the desire to drink and I shouldn't think I was cured because it was coming...Uhhh. Thanks dude. I get where he was coming from and I don't think that I'm in any way "cured" or anything. And I don't think that the desire to drink was taken from me by God or my higher power or anything. I don't have a desire to drink because every single day I'm making the effort to do physical concrete things to work on my recovery. I do feel confident that as long as I make the effort every day to do the things I need to do for my recovery I will not struggle with a desire to drink. And if at any point I start to feel a strong desire to drink I'd say that that would be a good indicator that I'm not fully working a program of recovery...Anyway after the meeting I hung around to give the newcomer woman my phone number because that's an AA responsibility. I'm benefitting from the program and I am now a member of AA so it's my responsibility to be there to help the alcoholic who's still suffering. Or something like that. I get the gist of it though - it'll only help me if I'm willing to help others...And somehow giving the newcomer my number turned into me picking this woman up on Sunday morning at 9am to get breakfast and then go to a meeting. I was not excited about this because y'know I wanted to spend Sunday morning with my husband not with a total stranger in the midst of some life crisis. But it kinda doesn't matter what I *want* to do. This is the shit that I need to do in order to stay sober and it's really not even a huge inconvenience for me to do it. I just don't want to. But I don't have to like doing it I just have to give it my best shot...Stay tuned tomorrow for the thrilling conclusion! And take care sober buddies!

Sounds like you are working a great program keep it up!  ..I totally get your frustration with the Debbie Downer oldtimers warning against complacency or feeling too confident.  While this is probably good advice and something to think about it can feel patronizing and like they are trying to knock you down.  ..I am impressed with your reaching out to newcomers that is great.  I often feel I don't do that enough so you're post is inspiring. ..Keep up the great work!! 
I think you are incredibly awesome for what you are doing. I am so proud of the things you are doing for another person too. I think deep down you might like it a little that you are helping. I like it a lot! Thanks for doing this for someone who needs it. We all need someone like you sometimes. :)
