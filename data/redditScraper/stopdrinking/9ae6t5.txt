There's too much of my story to tell in one post but I wanted to show appreciation for those that share their stories...It's motivating and inspiring to read about everyone's own personal experience with drinking. To be that brave posting something so personal is more helpful than you know. I know there are a lot of people like myself that may not have courage enough to share but we really appreciate those that do. Now I'm here posting too! ..I'm a bartender and I've been sober the last 7 months. I'm a bit introverted but I got myself out of the house tonight. I came prepared with LaCroix in my bag and had a good time at a party AND out at a bar. It was so validating to be able to go out and have some night life fun without drinking. I'm down on myself too much but tonight I'm really proud. My wallet has more cash from not buying drinks and I won't be hungover tomorow!!..Thank you to all that are a part of this community. Posters or visitors it just feels good to know you're not alone in this struggle...I Will Not Drink With You Today.......unless it's lime LaCroix

Congratulations on 7 months whilst working in such a difficult industry. IWNDWYT 
Woohoo for fizzy water fat wallets and sober fun! Staying clean for 7 months while being a bartender is some SERIOUS SOBER SKILLZ. Congratulations. IWNDWYT!
