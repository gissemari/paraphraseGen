I can't tell you what to do. But I can tell you If I did drink tonight I would feel much worse tomorrow than if I did not. If you choose to that is your choice. If you don't I will not drink with you. .Good luck on your journey and rest assured one direction will get better eventually and the other direction will get worse inevitably.
Sorry you're struggling. This isn't always an easy path. If you can maybe put off drinking for one more day. What's it going to hurt to wait another 24 hours? ..You may be experiencing some mild depression. I bet your brain is really confused as to why it's not getting its usual dose of "happy juice." Alcohol screws around with our body's reward responses and needs some time to readjust. I've been taking it really slow the last month and riding the highs and lows as best I can. I hope it gets easier for you soon!
Commit. Make the decision not to drink not that you will "try not to drink". I find I obssess over alcohol and it is always on the brain. What keeps me off it is keeping busy. Go for a jog play music if you're a musician do some night photography anything.
