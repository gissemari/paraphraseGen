I've been in and out of AA for two years and am currently 25 days sober. I've really been struggling because even my pretty open minded sponsor still says I need to have a higher power and pray to stay sober. Tonight I went to my first agnostic/atheist meeting and it fucking rocked! There were other women there who have 25 and 29 years of sobriety and they did it with ZERO higher power. I finally feel like I have a place in AA where I can be myself without compromise! Total game changer. I live in Tennessee so I really didn't think there was a secular option in my city but so thankful I found it however small!

Yeah we have 4/week in my city. I go to 1 or 2. It gets a little stale sometimes though because it's always the same people but I do feel like people in the meeting speak more genuinely. 
Start steppin'!.Happy for you!.IWNDWYT!
Former Tennessean here now living in the mid Atlantic. I went to school in Tennessee and still visit family there several times a year. Even though I've lived out of the state for 22 years it's still a shock to me when I go back and re-experience how pervasive and stifling and fundamentalist the culture is in my hometown. So I think it's really awesome you've found a group that honors atheism/agnosticism. Sending lots of warm thoughts to those home group members tonight. May they keep coming back!
