I'm attending weekly meetings of a group for women with addictions. The group has helped me a lot so far..And: I thought about going to AA meetings as well at least to check them out...I am not afraid of relapsing today or tomorrow but I thought it might be a good idea to get familiar with AA so I won't be afraid of going there if the urge is getting too strong. Because: the other meetings are on thursdays - so what am I supposed to do if I'm about to relapse let's say on a monday? Cravings don't follow a scedule as we all know ;-)..So is it possible to go to AA mettings only "once in a while" or only if you really need a meeting as soon as possible?.Or do they expect you to come regularly?..I mean I want to go there tonight to make sure I won't be afraid of going to a meeting when I really need it one day. But I'm kind of scared and I don't even know why...Who knows? Maybe I like it so much that I want to go there more often weekly or every other day or whatever. I might even find a sponsor or benefit from following the 12 steps...It's just really hard for me to go to my first meeting. I'm probably afraid due to my own prejudices. I can hardly imagine to meet women at my age (27) there on the other hand I know that this is not true since AA meetings are attended by old and young rich and poor women and men...I think the point of this whole post is: I just need some encouragement...:-).

The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking. You can come and go as you please put as much or as little into it as you want. Sponsors and steps are recommended but also not necessary. I go to Refuge Recovery meetings and the fellowship of sober people is an extraordinary resource. Let us know how it goes!
It seems really smart to know what to expect and get comfortable with going to a meeting ahead of needing one in the moment. Let us know how it went. 
Here's my experience on my first meeting. I'm very glad I went! ..https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/6nxp3h/i_just_went_to_my_first_aa_meeting/?st=J6255U67&amp;sh=a5aa4095
Go for it!
Welcome. My cousin who was about your age got sober in AA in Berlin.  She has since moved to Ireland but it worked for her.  ..It's always once in a while just the definition of while changes with the frequency of  the "need" for a meeting...Meetings and the people attending vary greatly find ones and people you are comfortable with and it will be fine...
Check it out.  Can't hurt.  I won't drink with you today.
