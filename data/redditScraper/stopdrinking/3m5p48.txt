*What was it like for you on day 30?*..*Were you still experiencing cravings at day 60?*..*I'm 6 months in and I'm struggling.  Is this normal?*..All of these are common questions on SD.  We thought it'd be handy to collect posts & comments and group them by the day the person was on when they made them...Example:  David comments on his Day 10 which is September 1 2015.  Roger comments on his Day 10 which is June 20 2011.  Both of their comments will appear together on the rSOYCD "Day 10" page.  ..It's essentially an **instant support group** consisting of hundreds or thousands of people on **the exact same day you're on.**..[**Here is a link** to /r/stopdrinking on your current day. (rSOYCD)](http://sd.bot.nu/rSOYCD/).===..And in the immortal words of cakes radishes and other delectable footstuffs solar-system wide ..**[  ONWARDS AND UPWARDS!  ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjTIJYDn48c)** ...(You're gonna wanna watch that video.)

Fantastic sobernaut video!
YESSSSSSS THIS VIDEOOOOOOOOO
I will never get tired of that stream of LaCroix cans...CHECK YO CANS
Very cool thank you mods!!
Can confirm video is genius. Source: I just watched it 15x (trying to read the fleeting meme)...Love love love the shades flashing on and off the 80s MTV homage the whole thing! ..This all makes me happy inside. Now off to see the new pages...
My day is talking about Ben and jerrys and having panic attacks in restaurants where ppl are drinking. Sounds jjjjjjust right
This is really great! Thank you for all the work you've put into it.
Whoa just lost 30 minutes browsing through a few days. What an amazing resource!
Just tried this feature awesome. Thankyou mods.
Fantastic idea! This is wonderful thank you! 
Is this going to the Right Side Bar? I think that would be great!!
That is SO COOL and super useful! Thank you!!!
This is so cool.  you guys are amazing.  This stuff help a ton.
Gah amazing! Way to grow the community and empower sobernauts everywhere 
The tool and the video are AMAZING! 
This tool is kncredible. I never cease being amazed here. 
This is awesome!  Thank you mods.
Awesome idea!
ERMAHGERD This is awesome on approximately 45340342129 different levels. Thanks for putting it together! My day posts for today were particularly prescient! :)
This is so neat. Man I remember day 90 like it was yesterday. ;)
This is an awesome resource! Thanks! 
Love this tool and particularly the Floyd reference ;-)  ..Thanks for everything you do SD curators.
I can go on one more day with this in my SOBER toolbox.  :D
Thank you for your hard work and dedication to this amazing place. What you mods do here is literally life changing and in many cases life saving.
Thank you so much for this! I've had mixed results with trying to search this forum for 30 day 6 month etc. landmarks.

What are the red numbers and the underlined numbers? It's probably obvious but I'm missing it.
Ah the many faces of poopoohead
THIS IS SO AWESOME!! ..What a huge repository of sentiments on being at a certain point in one's sobriety. I'll be browsing for days just checking this part of SD out. ..I haven't found any patterns yet except that sobies speak up when they achieve milestones--and rightfully so! That graph that's way at the bottom. You can see spikes at 30 60 90 100 1 year and 500 days. ..Attn: Science and medical community..SD is providing you with huge amounts of raw and processed data that might help you improve treatments for alcoholism. ..Video: so that's where they're keeping all the LaCroix!
This is very very cool. I wish I had a bit more time because I'd love to try some analyses on this stuff to verify these general responses I had in my first scan through..1. There's a lot of variety in how people are feeling on each day..2. Later day posts are more positive than early day posts but the negative ones are like SUPER real. Perhaps with a bit of recovery time we have the tools we need to effectively deal with day-to-day challenges that come up and reach out for support for the bigger "I've-never-dealt-with-this-before" things. ..3. The "I'm doing great/here's something that went well in my sobriety" seem to have more upvotes but I'd bet that they don't have many more comments than the ones from people reaching out for help. I think this community is really responsive to people looking for a solution. ..4. There's a few "I need to reset my badge posts" scattered through the later days. I wonder if that slows down as you move through the first two years: if it's common to have a couple false starts but if more time makes staying sober a little more likely on the whole..Really excellent work with this tool OTR!
This is fantastic! Thanks mods
Oh rad nice work!
This is an awesome resource thanks for the hard work you've put in to make it work. ..The video rocks!
This is really cool. You gotta keep this pinned forever. I could make a habit of reading this every day.
This is awesome. Thank you. When I'm feeling science-y I may try and run some of this through LIWC and post the results here if anything comes up.
Great stuff!
I just spent quite a while reading all the day 1 posts because I'm on day 1 myself. It's amazing to see how many of you posted exactly what I'm feeling: the self-loathing the regret the anxiety the fear the nightmares etc but now have huge numbers next to your name.
