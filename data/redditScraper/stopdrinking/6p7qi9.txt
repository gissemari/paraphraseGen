hi everyone..i haven't posted here before but i have reached 15 days and i wanted to check in. this community has really helped me along my way...it's kind of incredible how many factors go into my mentality to drink or to not drink. it's truly astonishing to me that i've been able to stick with it and combat all of these left field influences pushing me to drink. i've been around people drinking every night and chosen to stay sober. people have offered me drinks and tastes and i've continued to stay sober...the feeling of sobriety is starting to seem more secure and second nature. sometimes and some parts of the day (mainly morning and afternoon) i feel very secure and cannot imagine that anything could push me to drink but some days i reach the evening and it becomes very difficult to imagine the night WITHOUT a drink. it feels good to acknowledge how difficult it is to not drink and when i acknowledge this difficulty and accept that i feel that way it becomes easier for me to say no to alcohol. i think maybe in the past i wouldn't admit to myself that these moments were challenging and because i overlooked my emotions i was too confused to say no to alcohol or i got too comfortable or confident and it led to drinking...i feel like i am still in a headspace where i am waiting for the time when i do have a drink. like as though in 90 days or some number of time i'll feel comfortable or feel like i'm healthy again and have a drink. i don't want to believe this is true but i admit it's not engrained in me that i won't ever drink again as much as i don't ever want to drink again. ..it's been really nice to learn how to socialize and have a good time without alcohol. i feel a lot more balanced and in tune with my body and emotions. when i'm tired i go home instead of drinking more to endure the night. this has been really healing for me and nurturing for my spirit and personal identity. it reaffirms why i can't drink because drinking takes pieces away from myself that make me who i am and who i like myself to me...the people i'm surrounded by don't know that i'm sober i think they just think i don't drink that much. i'm kind of afraid of them thinking i'm sober or that i struggle with alcohol the stigmas suck. but this book the naked mind has really helped me break down how these stigmas work and how the fear of them can lead people to drink in order to not be associated with them and that has helped me accept that i'd rather be sober with some stigmas than be drinking to hide from what other people might think...anyways i'd love to hear some of your thoughts and advice. i feel that 15 days is an accomplishment for me but it is so small at the same time. any help for moving forward i would greatly appreciate.

Well done! The first 15 were the hardest for me. We're here for you if needed.
That's awesome to hear great job! I am at Day 13 first time I really put effort in to staying sober and I plan on staying that way. What is helping me is staying humble I am not "kicking its ass" or whatever but I am remembering why I made the decision in the first place and reflecting on what would have happened if I didnt... I'd probably end up dying. I wrote down a lot of my thoughts through out the 13 days and I reread them to keep it as a reminder... My fear is losing the humility of this entire experience and as someone that has existed in an extremely competitive professional space my entire career.... I worry that I think I am bigger than it again.
