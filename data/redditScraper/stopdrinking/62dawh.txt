I made the decision to quit drinking not that I have a problem with addiction but mainly how I constantly make bad decisions and do stupid stuff whilst under the influence. ..I realised a short while back that all my relationships had the same type of problems which was me and my drinking I got up to stuff that I am not proud of and completely wrecked alot of good relationships. ..My family are big on drinking so I've been brought up with this drink to get drunk habit basically I'm a binge drinker. ..I also noticed recently when I have drank that my hangover is lasting way longer than it usually would I'm talking till the point I go to bed around midnight now to me that can't be good if a hangover is lasting that long. (didn't drink anymore than I usually would on a night) ..I do struggle along Fridays as I get those drinking pangs and then have that voice in my head telling me that drinking is good it's fun don't listen to what other people say. But it's not fun for me anymore it's making my mental health worse. ..So I'm hoping to go T-total I know I can still have fun out with my best friend without me drinking same goes to family nights drinking I can definitely go without. ..I'm sick of wasting days been hungover it's such a waste plus I hate that guilty feeling the next morning. I'd rather spend my money on better things. ..

Not drinking with you today! 
Yeah I kept getting those feelings every Monday but by Thursday I'd be going out again. A few months ago I set a quit date for just after my birthday and have about a week and a half now. Last weekend was great not being hungover and going to work on Monday didn't suck.
