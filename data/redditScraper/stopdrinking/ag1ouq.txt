Hello everyone..I work for one of the top nightclubs in the country and easy access to tons of alcohol comes with the territory...My primary job duty is to bring in bottle service customers. I am paid a direct commission based off of the dollar amount these customers spend on alcohol. So it is a direct incentive for me to have these customers buy more bottles and sometimes that means I would help them drink more and more...&amp;#x200B;..I am at a point now where I can no longer operate like this. Drinking 3-4 times a week and being hungover is drastically hurting my physical and mental health. I have tried to stop many times but I always end up relapsing at my work. Im at the point right now where I am considering quitting my job but I just cant walk away from the income. My apologies for rambling Im just looking for some outside help/advice...&amp;#x200B;..Thank you everyone.

Money will come and go in my opinion- our physical and mental health should take priority. Besides how can you enjoy spending your earnings when you feel like garbage all the time? I hope you can find peace and whatever it may be that will lead you to happiness. Sending positive thoughts your way!
I don't know what to do but I do know that my sobriety has to be first. That has gotten in the way of work for me but I feel OK about it because I am 1000x healthier sober.
Maybe applying yourself to finding another job will give you the mindset that there's an end to this job. If you find happiness in sobriety its worth any sacrifice.  
It is difficult to say exactly what is right or wrong for you but if you're like me I can't safely drink so I would start looking for a different job. I know people who are sober and work in close proximity to alcohol but from the sounds of it you are basically paid to drink with clients if they want that.
