I ran across some things I had written during a very dark time of my life. I had major life altering events including domestic violence that necessitated a move. I was quite shell shocked by this thing that happened 'out of no where'. In reality we were both drunks and teetering on the edge and he got violent.  ..The page I wrote was some 8 months afterward. I had found some cards and a calendar with lists (they were my coping mechanism I made several lists every day). I wrote about the lists and cards and how I buried these things back where I found them because I couldn't deal with them even with miles and months separating me from them. I also had one  other sentence .."I drank again." ..I had stopped for a bit afterward. Then I drank again. Then I stopped then I drank again. ..I never drank enough before 12 years ago to be considered a drinker in any circle. What changed? Hell if I know for sure. Unhappy and not liking where I was in life. Drinking to submerge all the feelings I didn't want to feel. Strong family history of alcohol abuse? Sure. ..The biggest reason I relapsed is because I did not deal with the feelings that were unpleasant painful upsetting to myself and others. I had to drown the bad parts to numb my mind. It didn't work. ..The therapist said that recognizing the really bad things is important. I just need to recognize them as what they are and stop beating myself up basically . ..I am working on that. Every day I work on it like I obsessively wrote meticulous lists and ticked each item off as a sign of my progress every day. The lists that served as my reassurance that I was alive. ..So now everyday I write. I meditate I start to remind myself I should accept myself warts and all. ...Sorry for rambling.

That sounds like solid advice from the therapist. 
Hello and welcome. I spent years trying to figure out why I drank. I have come to the conclusion that I drank because I am a drunk. Turns out my circumstances had very little to do with it.
