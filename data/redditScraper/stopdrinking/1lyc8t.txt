**I am weak because I can't handle liquor. I am weak because I can't shake its hold on me.**..I started out thinking this. I felt I couldn't join the rest of the world because of those weaknesses. I felt I was a pariah among friends. I didn't want to know what they were thinking...There is always a pause when people find out. That initial feeling of what I think is pity from them. That moment where they're processing the information and I'm just squirming and confirming that I am indeed a weak person...I didn't want to stick out. I didn't want to feel broken. It's always at this point that they would congratulate me. That bothered me the most. Those felt insincere to me. It's hard to accept it when the person's drinking in front of me. ..The only person whom I've felt was sincere was my wife. It is my driving force to continue. It means the world to me to see her acknowledge it. She's the one I've hurt the most with my drinking and I never want to put her through that again. ..It is mind-numbingly simple when it is put that way. I don't ever want to hurt her and our daughter so I don't drink. I don't see any need for adulation. It isn't anything amazing. It's not a feat of impossibility... I just don't want them to have to deal with a drunken mess of a husband and father.  They don't deserve it. I am enough of a mess anyways I don't need booze to make it any worse...**I am weak if I begin to drink again. I am weak if I need to resort to alcohol.**..My new mantra. ..It is quite empowering to think that I don't need to get shitfaced when I'm stressed. I don't have to get drunk to take the edge off.. .I can completely understand the want to just forget. I can understand the desire to not give a fuck about anything anyone or myself. I've had urge to let it all go and watch the world burn for a bit but it does more worst than good. There isn't a point for it in the long run. .I can find things to take my mind off what is stressing me: Family exercise drawing video games etc...That is the easy part. ..It's the moments of celebration that are the most difficult for me and is still a struggle for me.  It is difficult to not be able to join in on a toast or to be able to have a beer with Sarah after she accomplishes an amazing feat. It was something that was commonplace before. .. Finish with a Guiness. ..What does everyone do? They have a drink to commemorate the event. They have a shot after a touchdown is scored. They cheers to the lovely couple. They sit back and relax after a difficult trial with a refreshing beer. It is common to celebrate with alcohol. ..I feel that I can't fully join in on their celebrations because I am not doing it their way. I can join in on all the jubilation but when it comes to the part with alcohol it just reminds me that I am not like them. ..The urge to drink is all but gone from me. It's easy to not drink. I don't ever want to let my girls down or hurt them. ..Trying to feel **normal** is the real battle...Happy six months..
