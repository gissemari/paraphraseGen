I haven't had a drink in 72 hours which is pretty big for me as I've been drunk for the past two years straight. I quit my liquor store job because I had a problem...I've been crying a lot and I'm really sad. I have been struggling with depression for a long time. ..For the first time I'm able to see clearly that I need help and that the bottle has been keeping me from seeing that...Thanks for your time.

Way to go! Sobriety can give you clarity in life which sometimes can be a little scary as it makes other problems more apparent. However facing them sober is much less daunting. 
The first 3 days are the toughest!! ..Congratulations on your recovery start. 
Congratulations on your first 72 hours!  I was able to start [stopping by using the ideas at the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  I hope something there is helpful to you.
Way to go! I hope you find the help you need. It can be really overwhelming to make big changes. keep a plan in mind but concentrate on what you need to do next. For me that was not drinking.
Congratulations! It's impressive that you could tell that the liquor store was a problem for you and then take concrete steps to leave it.
Keep it going buddy!
3 days under my belt too and I've been drinking almost everyday for 5+ years. Keep it up!
Thanks everybody! I appreciate the support. 
I've found the longer I go the easier it gets. Keep going! 
Congratz and good luck. I recommend getting a day counter from badge bot. As that number goes up it gets harder to convince self to give in to a relapse.
Withdrawal makes depression so much worse :( I remember just sitting there unable to sleep and just being soo sad. It's awful. But it will pass. 
Congrats on this decision. The road ahead is tough but it'll lead you to a wonderful and joyous place. If I were you I'd try and work on some of those negative emotions by seeing a counselor writing in a journal talking to a friend or exercising/finding a new hobby...I wish you the best! Stay strong live in the moment and keep that chin up!
