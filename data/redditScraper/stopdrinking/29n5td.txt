I have been struggling with and suffering from my drinking for far too long. It has been decades based on old journal entries. One thing I like about the Big Book is that it does not present a scientific explanation of alcoholism but rather it explains it in terms of thinking and behavior. I only need to relate not understand. One part that always sticks out to me is: .."The idea that somehow someday he will control and enjoy his drinking is the great obsession of every abnormal drinker. The persistence of this illusion is astonishing. Many pursue it into the gates of insanity or death."..And that is exactly me. I have been pursuing the illusion for far too long. This morning I woke up and decided I have had enough. I am letting go of the struggle for good. I refuse to chase the "great obsession" one more day. I am finished drinking.

Too true friend.  Great insight now let's start with the simple daily sober actions that we know that works.

Hello! Welcome to recovery. Letting go is freedom.
That's how we all start I am NOT drinking today.
I'm with you guys. I'm not drinking today.
Letting go of that struggle was the best decision I made.  I am truly at peace now having accepted that I cannot drink any longer.  It's no longer an option so I don't need to worry about it any more.  ..
Congratulations.  If you haven't had a drink today you are every bit as sober as everybody else here.  ..
&gt;Many pursue it into the gates of insanity or death...Many don't have to go that far we get off the bus before the last stop! You sound like you are going to give it your all.  Good luck.
