I have been on a business trip all week. I had the idea that staying in a hotel away from the usual things could be a bit like a retreat to give my liver a break. (I also mistakenly thought that the hotel had a gym and pool). I figured I might be able to think about drinking learn about my relationship to alcohol. ..I went without booze on a trip over a year ago and I mostly remembered feeling a bit bored that time. Not knowing what to do during down times but getting over that bit. ..I wasn't prepared this week for the physical withdrawal. I don't remember that being an issue last time. ..Perhaps one difference is that this time I'm thinking more about alcohol dependency and less about losing weight. Or perhaps my drinking has increased in the interim months and I became physically dependent. I know there has been less bingeing as I stepped back from the social life that was causing that when I started travelling for work. But I think I started drinking more during the day when I was travelling. It was how I relieved stress and boredom while workingespecially on the trips which can be intensely busy and lonely. ..I have had aches in my legs anxiety irritability etc this week. Felt like a mild flu on the third day. Knots of anxiety on the following days. Seems like since day three it's been easing slightly each day. I did get a cold sore yesterday probably due to stress. ..I have been reading this forum and books like Naked Mind Jason Vale etc. I still struggle with the idea of never drinking. The thought of being someone who doesn't want to drink appeals to me. I don't think I can drink moderately for long. I don't *want* to drink moderately! I want to not want to drink. ..I will keep at this to see what else happens. I definitely find weight loss to motivate me when the other reasons waver. Same with saving money. But I think if I were to say "great I went a week without drinking" it would be a fall of a sort. I would be succumbing to a kind of gravitational pull. I'd like to break free of the gravitational pull to float free out of the orbit of drinking. So I'll keep going. .

Great job on a week! The thought of never drinking again seemed like an impossible thing to me. I know that's the ultimate goal but forever is a long time. I broke it down into mini goals; 2 weeks 1 month 2 months etc and got to those by taking it day by day. I still focus on today but slowly the idea of never drinking again is seeming not so bad. Keep at it I'll not drink with you today!
Awesome post thanks for sharing !..The longer I go without booze and the more obvious the reasons for not drinking become.
