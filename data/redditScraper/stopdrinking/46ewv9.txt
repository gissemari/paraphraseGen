Had a gent struggling about his 3rd relapse. Listened to his story then the other members really took over and helped him think out of the box figure out some new ways to go about things. Hope he does well but he has some new tools today.

Kudos for 53 days! Glad you're finding meetings helpful. 
I really get a lot out of listening to people who come back after a relapse. It helps me to stay on my path and makes me treasure my own sobriety. A friend of mine relapsed this past weekend after 8 months of sobriety and it was so helpful to talk to him about what happened. I'm glad that you are going to meetings and getting a lot out of them! Keep up the good work :).
