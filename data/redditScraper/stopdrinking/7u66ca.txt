The first few days the daily struggle to not drink consumed my thoughts.  Now that a week has gone by the struggle is still ever-present but new difficulties are emerging.  The downside to drinking every day for the last 4 to 5 years is that I have become desensitized to the problems all round me in my life.  For example I've known that my marriage has been on the ropes for a while but I didn't realize how much I buried the hurt and disappointment in the bottle.  Now that the liquid soma isn't there I'm forced to actually process those feelings.  Despite knowing that this is the start of a more healthy relationship with reality  it still kicking my ass at the moment.  Even though my whole world feels torn open and raw at the moment I won't drink with you tonight.

Oh man even still I'm finding feelings coming up that I'd buried and it's so uncomfortable to feel them. More healthy and facing reality that's totally spot on... for me the start of this week was the first time in awhile that drinking crossed my mind :/ (so gradual how it goes from thinking about it every moment to every hour to every day to realizing you haven't thought about drinking today) but having actually felt those feelings and then eventually talked them out with the person wow it's kind of a big accomplishment. Annoying but good for the long run &lt;3..Yay for the both of us :p I will not drink with you today!
