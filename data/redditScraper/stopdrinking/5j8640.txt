Today is the first real day of vacation and tomorrow will be the end of my second week. In front of me are two full weeks of time off and it seems like an eternity. I'm trying to see this one day at a time but everything else right now is quantified by my time off...My two weeks of success tomorrow is trying to lie to me and tell me that it's been awhile and you are in control. A drink or two wouldn't hurt. Go ahead it's vacation a hangover won't effect anybody...But I know it will. It will effect my health if only for the day now and the day I might not get in the end. It will effect my kids and my wife in the lost time I won't realize they are even there around me...This is hard to say but I will not drink today.

Yep.  Shut down is the worst...I will not drink with you today!!
Stay strong! I will not drink with you today! :)
Ahh yes - the lies the drinking part of our minds will tell.  Glad you know a liar when you hear one.  Not drinking with you today!
Stay strong. That one drink is not worth it. I failed miserably this weekend at an attempt at drinking moderately. I wish so bad I could undo the weekend.
