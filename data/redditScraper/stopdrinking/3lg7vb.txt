I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3arzzv/i_had_my_wake_up_moment_four_days_sober_and_im/) terrifying summary of my life condition 92 days ago when my ankle was screaming with gout and I was crawling around the house with a pizza box and a debilitating seven-year hangover. It was the day it all caught up with me.  ..I am happy to report that a lot of beautiful life-changing things have happened in these 92 days. Some of it is just damn lucky. But I'd like to think that my sobriety and my evolving attitude about existence has pushed these positive changes ahead...I really started digging into my work to keep myself busy. I was promoted from my part-time position as a graphic designer to full-time marketing manager. I then out of the magic blue ether received a phone call for a job I had applied to many months ago for a director of digital marketing position. I used my new salary to negotiate an even higher salary...While money has never mattered to me and I come from seven generations of laborers horse thieves weirdos and working-class folk it is important to me to start paying off the insane credit card debt I acquired in the worst of my alcoholism. ..This new job also happens to be located in my hometown back in Michigan. I can't wait to be reunited with my family. Since moving out to the West Coast after my stint in Missouri as a lost recently dumped alcoholic professor I have been struggling like hell to put the pieces back together. I thought I would be stuck in this city forever far from home and family with no job prospects and an early death. ..Honestly I loved being a dishwasher which was my first gig out in Oregon since crash-landing here with two homeless wanderers I picked up on Craigslist who wanted to catch a ride out West. It humbled me to be showered by both used and forlorn ranch dressing and it taught me to laugh about the absurd and the small again. A thousand dirty ramikens can teach a thousand lovely lessons. ..I don't know. It's not easy and I fear the "slip" back. But I've lost weight my friends have noted I'm "glowing" and I feel like my life makes sense again. I've actually been dreaming about the future. It's been a long time since I could do that. ..I drink way too much coffee and still smoke too many cigarettes and eat too many burritos and I don't want to say that I'm necessarily **happy** though I do feel like my head is more or less clear and I'm on a good path. The path feels right this time. If I'm not happy I am at least motivated determined conscious and focused. ..I'm very much still fighting this addiction and it's a daily battle. I don't feel cravings but I feel a sort of strange "buzzing" in my frontal lobe and sometimes what I imagine a phantom limb sensation might be like. In talking with a friend he said this may be my "God hole" and existential anxiety. I think it is more likely that my brain is just not accustomed to not having alcohol. I'm not sure. In some ways I want to treat this seriously and in some ways I like to laugh about it because I take myself too seriously sometimes. And I have this capacity now to step back and laugh at myself in a positive way. ..I've gone hiking camping splashed in a kiddie pool like an idiot went out to see my friends' bands and drank soda water with lime gone on several sober promising dates with cute girls from the Internet and have just generally been a better person. I smile more I give more I think more. I feel a lot of weight and lethargy still but I know my body is recovering from quite the hell-ride. ..It's stressful living with addiction. I'd love to answer any questions that I could be helpful about. I know 92 days isn't a huge deal but it's the longest I've gone in years. I started drinking around a fifth a day when I was 17 or 18 still in high school and it never really stopped. Now it has. I'm proud. I'm getting stronger. Maybe this will encourage someone to give sobriety a shot. ..A lot has turned around in just three months and I can't imagine where I will be in three years or thirty if I make it that long. It feels worth trying now. Had I continued drinking I don't think I would have made it to my 30th birthday.
