Hey everyone I've never shared my story before but I feel ready to so I'm writing this to face up to the person I become when I drink. I also want to mention I have recently had some issues with drinking too however coming back here has helped immensely thank you.  ...For starters I'm 20 I feel inclined to stating that because drinking is something that many people my age do. I've never really been the type to have wild nights out; that's not really who I am yet when I turned 18 (the legal age for drinking where I live) I wanted to fit in since I've never felt like I have and drinking was a way to do that. I did have a few nights out and they were fun while they lasted but I have Crohn's Disease for those of you who don't know what that is it's a condition that makes the bowels become inflamed. I am in remission with it however it can and does still affect me. And our good friend alcohol does indeed contribute to it. I was diagnosed before I turned 18 so with wanting to fit in I guess I also wanted to feel 'normal'.  ...I've also had a lot of issues while growing up and I did become rather depressed due to these issues and that lead to a lot of suicidal tendencies which are still affecting me. These issues are primarily why I no longer wish to drink because I want to live but I don't want to live in fear of what actions may occur due to my thoughts because with how low I've ended up lately I don't want to get to that point again.  ...I will do my best to summarise what happened and if anyone wants to ask me anything feel free. I worked at a bar and I did enjoy it but it was a highly stressful job and with issues regarding the rotas events in which we were badly understaffed and this all really made my mental health worsen and my anxiety got really bad to a point where it triggered me to become depressed again and I would envision myself dying every shift. And if for example my thought was about me drowning my breathing would feel heavy like I was struggling to breathe if I envisioned myself getting stabbed in the chest or impaled I'd feel chest pains. It got so bad that I went to the doctor for help and the first doctor I saw was extremely dismissive he didn't want to do anything except tell me to go and get my own help from a service which I had used a few times and hadn't worked for me but I did ask to try medications since that was an avenue I hadn't been down before and a lot of people at work advised that it can help them. My doctor decided to put me on Prozac and from what I've been told it's not really a good one to start with. His advice with the medication a vague "it gets worse before it gets better." He didn't explain how it got worse he didn't explain the risks with alcohol either.  ...While on these meds I became erratic I'd have the same symptoms but heightened but I'd also be quite manic so I'd constantly joke about suicide actually performing the act and most shifts I'd either tell friends or text them on my break that I was going to jump into traffic. Another effect was I'd totally forget what I was doing for example trying to cross a road I'd stop and wait for traffic then forget what I was doing and start walking across the road even if more traffic was approaching. On the second week of being on this medication I met up with a friend that I was trying to court with at the time and I met him at a bar (he's a student.) His boss was there as well and she drank a lot she also had a tendency to make others drink to a point where she'd get/ act annoyed if people didn't. I know I said that I couldn't drink due to these meds but I know that I did and I jokingly told the guy I was trying to court with that I was going to jump into traffic and left without saying any form of goodbye yes it was cruel and I do feel bad but I can't change what happened now. One of my friends eventually found me and let everyone know I was safe. The next week I needed to go back to the doctor for more meds and protocol is that an appointment is made to discuss how things have been on them. However when I tried I was unable to get an appointment but they gave me more meds and that Friday I was up at 4am for an opening shift at work I had a few errands to run after work and decided to have a few soft drinks in bars (my kind of night out since it's casual and chilled.) In the last bar I went to an ex-colleague saw me and started to talk to me I told him I couldn't drink but he insisted and again I drank in fact I had a night out and I didn't return until 8am the next morning. so I'd been awake for 28 hours I'd consumed alcohol I can't remember how much but I was drunk and I slept for a few minutes but was still pretty wrecked when I woke and to ensure I took my med for that day I took it then and after a few minutes when it started to work I lost control of what I was doing and I subsequently overdosed on the additional meds prescribed (it was only a weeks worth plus what I had so 12 prozac and 8 paracetamol that I had there too.) I went to the hospital where I was put on a drip to flush out my system and I got better.  ...Since then I've moved out of my parents house as it and they are part of the problem I left the job I had that was making me unwell I am still searching but I've had a few interviews lately and I'm hopeful and most importantly I am happier sure I still have issues but I have a new doctor who is actually listening to my needs as a patient he's willing to listen to what I want to do for treatment and things are getting better. I have had a few blips last week I had a glass of wine the next day I had a bad stomach and the following days my mental health wasn't so good but I do believe that I can overcome this I just want to share my story since I know some of my circumstances are personal but I believe had I not had alcohol I'd have not ended in the situation I have where I tried taking my life essentially.  ...Thank you all for reading IWNDWYT

Glad to hear that things are going better. I'm 22 and been having problems with substance abuse for probably 6 years now. I regonize myself in some parts of your story I've become quite a drinker after I turned 18 the legal limit in my country. I didn't really need to socialize but rather take the edge off and to not have to face my problems. I've been drinking mostly by myself at home watching movies TV shows etc.  ...I managed to get myself partly back on track by going to the gym and eating well but was still drinking for maybe another year in moderation. Then I've found out **Dr Jordan Peterson** his videos helped me a lot. If you don't know him check him on YouTube etc. I think he has some great knowledge to pass to lost young men.  ...And I think the most important thing is to have a doctor that knows what he's/she's doing. I am surprised by the number of doctors that don't know how to listen and take you seriously and rather stuff you with pills.  .Last thing: Maybe you could do your research and ask your doctor about Phenibut. I am by no means a person qualified to advocate for any substance but just from my experience and from the experience of the people I have discussed it with it is a great tool for dealing with depression and I would assume that in low doses it's quite safer than usually prescribed antidepressants.  ...Good luck mate!
Thank you for the comment I hope you're getting better. Thanks for the advice I'll keep the other meds in mind but I was hesitant to try meds before I went on them and after what happened I don't want to risk being on them again but if my doctor believes they could help then I will consider it at the minute I'd rather not take such a risk...I'll take a look at the guy on YouTube too. Thank you...Take care mate :)
