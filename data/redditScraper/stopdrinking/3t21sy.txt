I want to thank everyone here who posts their failures relapses struggles negative emotions slips and such. I know it's not just me but negative examples sometimes teach as much or more as positive ones (Keep posting those too!)..My head instructor gave this advice when a few of us were struggling with fighting on the ground. (Our system is a stand up system so we sometimes have issues with ground fighters who know more than us.).."If you are going against someone with more skills even if you have to tap out 1000 times in a row you learned 1000 ways to lose that you didn't expect. Now you can expect them and take steps to counter them."..I feel the same way with our journey into sobriety. I've learned a lot about what not to do but even more than that I have seen others make mistakes I **would** have eventually made myself if I didn't see the forewarning here...So seriously thank you for posting what didn't work. You all don't know how much it helps others.

The Chicago Cubs must be most learned team ever.  
I must be one of the duller tools in the tool shed...At a month and a half sober I joined my friends for a weekend getaway that I knew was going to be booze-filled.  I thought to myself:  "I've been sober for over a month now I'll be fine!"..By the second night of the weekend I threw myself into smoking so much pot I could barely function.  ..While I didn't drink I did get totally obliterated suffered cravings anew posted about it all here and requested a badge reset.  ..**Dry people dry places** was the message I was reading nodding my head in agreement about and totally ignoring until after that weekend...
