[*Have you never been mellow? Have you never tried to find a comfort from inside you? Have you never been happy just to hear your song? Have you never let someone else be strong?*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IFQZyxxyyM)..VE turns 30 today!.===..Am I still allowed to say that?  I think I can still say that. It's not until ~35 where it's polite to start leaving out the exact age. Right?  ..Maybe I should leave the age out anyway just to be safe.  OK no one read those numbers plz. ty.  ..Let's just go with:  *VE is older than /r/stopdrinking.*..[January 26 2011](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/f9d1y/reddit_once_again_i_am_asking_for_your_help_and/): Drunk Victoria...[August 23 2011](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/jr11x/whats_been_the_best_part_of_stopping_drinking/c2eqxel): Badged Victoria...[October 22 2011](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/llc5v/introduction_of_my_struggles_and_recovery/): Determined Victoria...[November 23 2011](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/mnhml/six_months/): Six month sober Victoria..[January 3 2012](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/o1ocn/big_step_for_this_alcoholic/): Independent Victoria..[March 9 2012](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qpox8/just_got_dumped/): Dumped Victoria [(followup)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qx5yw/checking_inwith_a_big_smile/)..[May 28 2012](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/u9lzl/i_did_it_i_made_it_i_cried_my_eyes_out_when/): 1 year sober Victoria..[December 31 2012](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/15qq55/a_new_year/): In love Victoria..[January 16 2013](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/16q3ko/my_600th_day_sober/): Gettin' srz Victoria..[March 20 2013](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1anoq9/whats_up_wednesday/c8z7lxe): Engaged Victoria..[May 27 2014](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/26mxa2/three_years/): Wedding planning Victoria..[Aug 9 2014](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2d262c/im_not_dead_i_got_married_thank_you_sd/): Married Victoria ([more](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2fniia/you_guys_are_my_home_please_enjoy_some_more_of_my/))..[October 14 2014](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2j7p36/the_chicago_columbus_day_meetup/cla21ys): Star-struck Victoria..[November 19 2014](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2msqd8/i_just_got_into_graduate_school/): Grad school Victoria. .[December 9 2014](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2ou3qp/i_am_responsible/): Responsible Victoria ..[August 2 2015](https://www.reddit.com/r/swolebriety/comments/3fi6xm/my_swole_sober_people/): Swole Victoria ..[September 7 2015](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3k18bw/starting_my_internship_tomorrow/)  Intern Victoria..November 20 2015:  30 year old Victoria...---..If someone had told me years ago that you would become such an important part of my life well...

Happy birthday VE!   I love reading this history. Your growth strength and empathy to others is truly inspiring.  I am constantly in awe that someone so young could achieve so much in her recovery.  You truly one of my sober heroes.

Alles Gute zum Geburtstag!!..[This is my favorite Happy Birthday video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ_ZQkV58Cc)..Lol I hope it is not inappropriate. It is totally about addictions  =P..But I love the music!!..Even though I am not drinking and I expect it to stay that way I send this video to my friends for their birthday. More because I like it than to send a message or anything. There is nothing behind it...Have a very happy 30th birthday Victoria. All the best for you!

Happy birthday Victoria! Thank you for all of the support that you give to recovering alcoholics. You do so much on this sub and you also do so much in your real life. It was an inspiration reading your posts throughout recovery.
This timeline is amazing! Thank you for putting it together. 
Happy birthday thanks for all you do
Happiest of birthdays to you!  Thank you so much for all you do here :)
What a great decade to begin sober and fabulous!  Happy birthday Victoria!! :)
Happy Birthday and thank you.
I turned 31 in October. Spent my 30th birthday 2000km from home in rehab. I've been doing great and then as usual fucked up.... doctor wants tests for organ failure. Also Canadian so fist bump on that...I sincerely congratulate you /u/VictoriaElaine for being so vigilant. I'm afraid I don't have the strength any longer..
Happy birthday VE!!!!! 
Happy Birthday VE! I hope you celebrate all weekend! Thank you for all you do for us around here. This is a lovely post from a good friend. 
You've been around here for years and I love the support you've given everyone. Through all my failed attempts of sobriety it's great to see you succeeding. And it helps me that's why there's a 12 next to my name.
OTR does it again. VE has a few months on me but I tell you what it was pretty damn powerful to see a post from drunk her. And on that note I wish I had my old account. Wish I could see what I wrote when I wasn't lurking the month or so before I got sober. I think the only weird/unsettling thing for me would be to see a video of drunk me. VE Happy birthday and congrats on your sobriety. 
Happy 30th Birthday /u/VictoriaElaine!!! Have a great day!! Your timeline is amazing and an inspiration. Thanks Rocks for sharing it's a beautiful thing to do :)
Happy Birthday /u/VictoriaElaine!
This made me smile :) happy birthday to you!!
Happy thirtieth u/victoriaelaine way to go!..Thanks for this soberlog rocks!
Happy birthday. We probably have different views about hockey teams but I'm sure we agree on pretty much everything else. Hugs from Montreal.
Belated happy birthday VE!
