Last Friday I made a decision. ..I don't want to poison my body. I won't wake up hungover ever again and will never pick up another cigarette as long as I live...I am feeling optimistic prepared and excited for a life full of feeling (happy and sad) a body capable of endurance and strength and a mind free of worry doubt and destruction. ..It's been a long time coming and I couldn't have made this choice for my life without the help of my therapist Rational Recovery (highly recommended book!) and of course all of you wonderful people! ..Thank you for sharing your stories of struggle and success you've been a real inspiration and I hope to do the same for others!..Have a kick-ass and sober day!! Take the reigns and roll!!

Sheena IS AWESOME!
Awesome! Your enthusiasm is infectious...thank you for sharing!
Ok. I'm impressed.  Smoking AND drinking?  Yow!  You go!
Hot damn i gotta get on this no-smoking bandwagon. so many people look down on it now and its a huge turn off for employers.
Those are two deadly killers you are getting out of your life. Now you get to feel what real living feels like.
