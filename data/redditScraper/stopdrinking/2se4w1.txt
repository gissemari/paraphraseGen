Good morning fellow sobernauts!..Here we are again - [Hump DAAAAYYYYY!](http://davidkanigan.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/camel-snow-winter-funny-hump-day.jpg?w=600) (Side note: Brr!)..Here in WuW we all share our struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations. It's a place to check in see how our /sd buds are doing and support each other in our sobriety...**Triumph**: I actively avoided a relapse by playing the tape forward - IN MY DREAM! I had a very realistic dream last night where I was in almost exactly the same situation as my last relapse. I was left alone with access to lots of alcohol and the ability to keep my drinking a "secret." I recognized the danger forced myself to "play the tape forward" and carefully walked around the room turning off all the lights walked out and closed the door behind me. ..It was scary but if feels good! Some of the thoughts that went through my mind as I was playing the tape forward were:..* A few drinks won't be enough. It won't stop there...* Your whole weekend will turn into a drunken binge. All your fun plans will be f*cked...* You'll be so unhappy if you choose to do this. And what about all the /sd people rooting for you?  :)..**Struggle**: Because I spent so much time drinking and being unreliable I've boomeranged way over to the "super-reliable" side of things and I'm having a hard time calibrating my expectations of others as a result. I have a friend who's constantly flaking on things; it's just who she is. But I'm really letting it upset me unduly I think partly because it reminds me of all the times I flaked on people because of my drinking usually with lame lies and promises that it wouldn't happen again. (Spoiler alert: it did.) So yeah I'm exploring that this week. ..**General Chat**: So it took almost 6 months but I think my insane sweet tooth is slowly starting to wind down. I've had ice cream in the freezer for three whole days! That would have been impossible a few months ago. :)..Alright guys - it's all you!
----------immediate responses--------

**STOP THE PRESSES.  WHY DID NO ONE TELL ME THAT THERE'S A NEW HUMP DAY COMMERCIAL?!?**  ..Hey!  cake!  [Guess what day it is?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxCVtEeJnZ0)..Triumph:  I intended to take a nap last night at 7 pm.  Great success!..Struggle:  ...and that "nap" lasted 5 hours.  I've been up since midnight.  Go me!..General Chat:  MikeMikeMikeMikeMike........
OK here goes..Triumph:  A month ago celebrated my 5 year sobriety  so much has happened in the last 5 years and can not believe how much my life has changed from the first tentative weeks of not drinking...Struggle:  I have a home group which has really drifted to far away from message and I need to pluck up the courage to change but fear of change and possibly having to change sponsors is seriously holding me back...Chat:  I am new to this sub and would like to say hello to everyone hope I can be of help to people if they need to chat or have any quesions.
Struggle: 6 degrees...Triumph: the dog took a dump right away...General chat: to prison meeting tonight starting to prepare for my trip to escape winter. (guess thats a triumph too...)
Triumph: I have been sober for six days. Today is my seventh and I will stay sober today. This is the longest (by FAR) that I have been sober in over four years. ..Struggle: I still have to take things minute by minute. I attended my first AA meeting a few days ago but didn't return because a creepy guy sat down next to me and kept trying to flirt and get my number. It made me feel sick. I couldn't concentrate on what the speakers were saying. It's the only meeting I can make as there are not a lot of them in my area. There aren't any SMART meetings at all in my area. So I'm kind of distressed about that because I am going this alone in "real" life...General Chat: Hi. I'm glad to be here. I'm looking forward to feeling better in a few weeks.
**Triumph** .I've recommitted to sobriety and feeling mentally &amp; emotionally better for it...**Struggle** .I just found out that I've got optic nerve damage consistient with glaucoma. This sucks but it hasn't massively affected my vision and is something I can control. The big bummer for me is that it means I can't really take any more prednisone which has been my "get out of jail" card when things get bad. But it probably caused the glaucoma so nothing comes for free I guess...**General Chat** .I got snow tires put on yesterday. Not sure if they're going to make that much of a difference in how my car handles the snow but they *do* have a 5 year road hazard warranty. Bring it on potholes!
(Ignore badge relapses suck today is day 2...again). ..Triumphs: ..I had two slip ups this past week but got right back on the wagon the next day (Not in terms of productivity but in terms of staying sober the following day.). ...Struggles: ..Fucking law school personal statements are hard. I can't figure out what the hell to write about that isn't going to make me sound batshit. ..Actually the whole law school application process. I have a decent GPA and a really good LSAT (pretty good case for a T-14) so I should be fine but I've already gotten exasperated and drank twice over this nonsense after deciding that I needed to get sober.  My sponsor also thinks that I shouldn't go to law school this fall and she's really tough on the "I need to learn to take direction" front. Blargh I might need to think about finding someone else to sponsor me. ..I need some sober time so I can get properly screened for ADHD and (hopefully) medicated for it. ..General talk: ..Hi! 
Triumph: 2 weeks sober! Told all of my "core" friends and family that I stopped drinking and they were supportive...Struggle: I've had super vivid dreams every night that aren't related to drinking but seem to disrupt my sleep and wake me up in an anxious fit. Speaking of anxiety I'm moving into a new apartment and struggling to get some traction looking for places...General Chat: It is really ridiculously cold outside. I'm ready for spring.
**Triumph:** 600 days tomorrow that's a nice round number...**Struggle:** Winter can f itself in the a...**General Chat:** I took a course in wood turning on the weekend and I loved it! I see a lathe and copious amounts of sawdust in my future. Here's my first bowl [before](http://i.imgur.com/QUPO0Lx.jpg) and [on the lathe](http://i.imgur.com/2jecT3W.jpg?1) I forgot to take an after shot. 
Exercise writing walking my dog lots of candy (eep) &gt;_&gt;
Eight months is what's up!
**Triumph:** I had a wicked talk with my cousin about my not drinking. We are going on a trip to AZ for the SuperBowl in 2 weeks and I really wanted her to be aware of how serious this is for me so she wouldn't pull the "oh c'mon you're on vacation!" card. She actually started the convo. She's worried about her own drinking. I told her if I drink in Phoenix I truly have no clue when I'll quit again and she was all "then drinking is simply not an option". She also asked to come to an AA meeting with me sometime. Woah. Neat. ...**Struggle:** I've been mad depressed for the past week. Probably stronger than I've ever felt it before. These past few days have been getting better but I'm still planning on seeing my doctor about it cause this can't be normal haha. Knowing I can make it temporarily go away by drinking is a thought I have. But I'm also not down for that. I know it's a very temporary solution. ...**General Chat:** I'm playing this ridiculous online fake Big Brother game (yes like the TV show) and it's completely taken over my life. I'm on the block to be evicted this week and I'm worried! I think I have the numbers to save myself but pray for me plz. You're totally allowed to judge me. 
Triumph: Went to a convention over the weekend and didn't drink even though the alcohol was flowing everywhere!..Struggle: We're leaving today to bury my wife's aunt who died of pneumonia Saturday. She was a hardcore alcoholic and that certainly played a part in her death. She was the "hide it around the house" kind of drunk very good at convincing people to go buy for her even when she was wheelchair and oxygen-bound. I suppose her husband enabled her but after years of her successfully sneaking around I think he finally just gave in. Second member of that family to die an alcohol-related death this year; my father-in-law developed Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome and just sort of withered away...Chat: That damn sweet tooth gets me as well! I lost about 25 pounds when I quit drinking but then Christmas rolled around. I was determined to save the rest of my family from those Christmas calories by taking on each cookie one-by-one and damn if I didn't succeed
Triumph: I was off yesterday and didn't drink. In the past I would start at 6am when my wife left for work..Struggle: our alarm didn't go off and we were almost 2 hrs late to get up. Beat myself up pretty bad over that. I need to find the balance between super responsible and super irresponsible..Chat: Hi. It's my first post in WuW. I came to reddit out of curiosity lurked around for the porn but joined because of SD. I love to drink but I love my wife and marriage more. Not drinking today.  
hey guys! happy hump day. ..**triumph:** came back and reset my badge despite that ambivalent chatter in my head. .**struggle:** lapsed this past weekend on a business trip. I was doing GREAT at home in my own space and routine but I travel frequently for work and I'm going to need to build strategies for this. .**general chat:** schools were all delayed here in the South and we got no snow overnight! 
**Triumph** First week of school done. I am in love with the program. Living in Toronto has been amazing so far. I miss my husband immensely but all is well in the universe!..**Struggle** No big ones :)..**General chat** My hamster escaped my room last night and ventured into my roommate's. Hamsters are fucking sneaky little things. 
Triumph: Done 3 days starting to feel more normal and I'm eating.Struggle: Dealing with work I'm not sleeping much and have called in once (I'm only in a few times a week).General Chat: I sure hope I can beat my 3 weeks of a few months ago. This I've had problems getting past that stage. I think I'm going to go see a doctor get medication and push off blood tests a few weeks. I'm worried bad results would get me to relapse.
Triumph:  Today is a good day.  I've been having issues sleeping and last night I feel like I actually had a good night's rest with the help of some benedryl.  My daughter is doing good in her new program. Because there is so little opportunity for children with mental illness this  program is mostly children are either foster kids or court appointed and they put her in a group with littler kids between groups so she isn't so stressed out or badly influenced by the tough gangster girls. She's such a good kid with such a good heart. Having conversion disorder means that when she has bad days she is in a lot of pain or she has face tics.  Sometimes parts of her body just won't move. There was a time she was in a wheelchair for 3 months unable to walk.  She hasn't mentioned any pain in the last week so we're doing really good. ..Struggle:  As I continue to understand mental illness I've had to flip my thinking on many things.  I've always believed that medication for depression was unnecessary as the US is so heavily medicated. It still feels wrong every morning when I feed my child prozac and anti-anxiety medications. I still don't know if I'm going about this the right way but I keep trucking ahead. Coming to grips with the fact that we may always have to fight this is hard but no one ever said parenting was easy. ..General Chat:  I work from home and I'm new to the area so I'm pretty lonely most days.  I try to keep myself motivated with projects when I'm low on marketing tasks but sometimes fail and take a nap.  Today I'm going to start a diagram for our spring garden.  Figure out what to plant where to get the most out of our space. And not one piece of arugula is going in.  Last year I was excited about arugula but I hate the stuff now.  It took over my mesclun mix and I had to eat way too much of it.  F'in arugula. 
**Triumph**: I'm doing really well at work lately. I was asked this week to handle an important and sensitive project. It's *possible* this could've happened even when I was drinking. The difference now is that I feel totally confident that I can do this whereas before I would have been a petrified mess. ..**Struggle**: I'm having a hard time talking about my sobriety with my partner. We talked about it when I was drinking and we talked about it when I quit. But now I feel like it's essentially over for her and it's not over for me. I didn't say anything about making it to 90 days even though that was a big deal to me. I dunno. ..**General chat**: Winter am I right?
Struggle: Decided to quit my job on the framing crew last Friday because it was starting to threaten my sobriety. My two bosses who are also my best friend's step brothers are both long-time pill abusers(I am also a former pill addict 7+ years clean now) and the constant mood swings yelling at each other (and me usually for no freaking reason) and general dickishness were starting to take their toll. I know I made the right call but now unemployed for the time being. ..Triumph: I helped build a [house!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwIe_sjKeAY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=30s) Literally from the basement up. [Pic!](http://imgur.com/vZbbyZ6) Very proud of myself for that. Plus I was able to save some money so I'm not stressing out so much about making plans for the future. Already heard back from one company and made it to round two so fingers crossed. ..General Chat: I will not miss working in this cold! 
DUDE I didn't even realize it was Wednesday been kicking so much arse at work 
Guess what day it is!  MEMEMEMEMEMEMEME..**Triumph**: Things are going great in JBH-land.  I'm playing lots of tennis spending quality time with the wife hanging out with friends being productive at work I've been reading more lately (with my new Kindle I got at Christmas) and have been overall really happy!..**Struggle**: I've got nothing!..**General Chat**: I'm in another tennis tournament this weekend.  It's a few hours away and I'm going with a friend.  I'm not concerned at all about drinking... I went to a similar tournament in August and had no issues.  I can't wait to get away for a few days and kick some butts in a different city!
**Triumph:** Things are going well. Still. My depression is under control (for now) and I can focus on other aspects of recovery now. The next frontier of recovery will be to improve my relationship with my wife...**Struggle:** Between work kids and a cold my sleep is all jacked up. I've been too sick to exercise.  I've exceeded the LD50 for caffeine several times this month just to get through a work day...**Chat:** My badge says it's a [palindrome day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUQDzj6R3p4).
Triumph: I celebrated my 29th birthday yesterday which was my first sober birthday in a decade. It also marked 100 days sober. It was beyond question the best birthday I've had since I was an innocent little kid. I spent it at my home group meeting surrounded by all the people I have to thank for my sobriety. It was perfect!..Struggle: I'm in the early stages of dating someone very special someone I would have had no chance of developing a relationship with while I was in active addiction but I have not yet shared with her that I'm in recovery. She knows that I haven't had a drink since October 2014 and I made it clear that I intend to keep it that way but I still feel like I'm being dishonest with her and that's not good. ..I'm also about the start my 4th step in AA which is what separates the men from the boys. I know I'm ready for it but I know this will kick up a lot of dust that had settled since I gave up alcohol and drugs...Chat: This sub continues to kick a whole lot of ass! Thank you to everyone who has shared their insight and experiences. Sober living has been wonderful in ways the old 'me' could have never imagined!
My first WuW here goes.....Struggle: Starting this journey..Triumph: Getting to Day 3!.  .General chat: Ummm hello? Looking forward to sipping on ginger beer when I get home :-)
Good morning SD. ..Triumph: didn't drink after being rejected via a spineless and generic 2 sentence email for a decent job I had interviewed for 3 times (about 4 hours) and had been all but promised that it was a done deal. Not gonna lie - it was as close as I've come to drinking since sobering up. ..Struggle: putting my professional ego aside and taking a job that's not fulfilling or ideal in any way just because I need to get $$$ flowing in ASAP. ..General: very excited about my new hobby of knife making. Hoping to eventually turn it into a profitable side business. 
Triumph: 30 DAYS!!! First time in 10 years..Struggle: Still catching up at work ..General Chat: Listening to the new Code Orange album these kids show a lot of potential and hope they have a Converge like career trajectory 
Triumph: I got through day 1... My first sober day since my son was born and I had to stay a couple nights in the hospital. Which was 3 weeks ago. Last sober day before that? Couldn't tell you. Probably sometime in 2013...Struggle: I work 9-10 hours outdoors in the cold. I come home to a newborn son a 2 and-a-half year old attention deprived daughter (who is in the middle of potty training) and a sleep deprived wife who is still recovering from surgery. Normally I escape the chaos with some (too many) beers.  Last night was tough. And tonight will be too...General chat: Keeping with the theme winter can suck it.
Day 3 still clean.
Triumph: My anxiety is starting to return to a more manageable level. Additionally have been investigating graduate schools and other related options rather than just paying lip service..Struggle: So so Sooooo broke! Like "can't even keep my cellphone turned on" broke. And this weather isn't helping either. 
Triumph: today is my 52nd birthday and the first sober one in i can't even count how long. My biggest present is today and the last nine days. I will not drink today. ..struggle: SO is headed out of town for the weekend leaving me and one child. Usually I'd be stocking up on booze. Finding a different way this time. (-;..chat: Sorry everyone's in the cold - here in seaVille we have a glorious sunny day. Thanks everyone on this reddit - the talk here gives me so much strength. 
[deleted]
Triumph: I'm 20 days sober and I'm not going to drink today..Struggle: I had a mini breakdown last night. I ended up crying a little bit. But I didn't drink.
Triumph: Slept really well last night pain in abdomen and heartburn seem to be reduced...Struggle: Best friend (and drinking buddy) hit me up to hang out tonight had to tell him I was "taking some time off" due to health problems. He's an understanding guy but I feel bad having to blow him off. I need to reach out more and invite him over for non-drinking related activities...Chat: The thing that started me wanting to quit again was the pain in my right side flaring up again. I've had it off and on for over 2 years and I know it's fatty liver. I'm only in my early 30s so I know that doesn't bode well for the future unless I get healthy. I'm only one day in but I've made a commitment to stay abstinent for the next 4 weeks (not that I'll stop after that that's just how long the official commitment lasts). If I blow it I have to pay a lot of money and I definitely don't want to do that so I'm sort of tricking myself into doing what I know needs to be done. I'm hoping after the 4 weeks are over to re-up the commitment and just continue on the sober path.
**Triumph:** My research advisors (grad school) gave me surprisingly positive feedback today when I presented a summary of my work to them. Ready now to take an important step (oral preliminary exam). Drinking-me was mentally slow procrastinating and terrified of my job constantly stumbling to exaggerate my progress to hide my drunken negligence and terribly ashamed/guilty about squandering my opportunity. Freshly-sober-me isn't magically back up to speed and I'll never quite be able to undo years of avoidance and scraping by on minimal effort but holy fuck does it feel good to have that pitiful version of myself 3 weeks behind me and counting. ..I would never have been able to present my research as lucidly as I did today if I haven't quit drinking when I did. I have no doubt that my graduation depends on my sobriety. I can cry now about how close I came to losing what I have and it doesn't scare me to let it out or face all the related pain because I'm here in sober land and no one can kick me out and it's OK. Even if none of my plans work out I never have to be that lost again. I. Don't. HAVE. To. Drink. Today that is relief...**Struggle:** Pretty overwhelmed by the triumph right now but I will try to think of something. Quitting drinking together did not magically fix all the pent-up communication trouble with my spouse (no shit!). Still haven't really addressed it yet. Starting to realize how much we've used alcohol to fuel communication and how much denial was a part of our shared mental space. Feeling kind of lonely about this but having trouble finding any sort of voice at all. Trying to give it a bit more time. At least we still like each other!..**General Chat:** No official responsibilities tomorrow and looking forward to tea and video games. :)
**Triumph:** Friend asked me last night if I wanted to stop and get anything before we went to his place to play a video game. I said I didn't have my cards and he said he'd get it no questions. Despite driving past two liquor stores I said "No not really. I saw that donut shop but they'd all be stale by now." I also upped my treadmill PR from my month post to 9:30min/mile...**Struggle:** I had a drinking dream last night. I woke up thinking for a second that I'd fucked up. Also my friend just went back to jail for 6 months and we talked every day. He was my sober buddy trying to avoid jail that way. Technically he'll still be a sober buddy just a little less accessible to talk to. Pretty much everyone else I know drinks though. I'm also dealing with a nightmare bathroom reno and having recently got in contact with my estranged dad. Needless to say there's a lot of stress that I generally ignore from day to day...**Chat:** I'm a little overwhelmed that I'm applying to yet another school in a few months. It'll be weird if I get accepted but I won't find out until December. I've been in this whole rut of just working that I completely forgot what being in school is like. And I can't even imagine having way more disposable income than I do right now when I'm going to have a position that will either double or quadruple my current pay. But then again student loans.

Triumph: Good blood test results back earlier this week. .Struggle: I have a memorial service to go to this saturday for my diabetic+alocholic friend who died a few weeks ago. .General Chat: I am going to try to learn keyboard. I ordered a beginner one. It seems like a nice way to kill some time in the evenings. 
Triumph: I managed to get myself out of my initial morning bad mood.Struggle: I'm struggling to not psyche myself out about the amount of work I've got to do especially since I lost a day to being sick..General chat: I didn't use my starbucks reward yesterday when it expired since I was sick the nice lady still let me use it. Score and board. .Thanks for doing this cake_or_radish I like these posts. 
I am rather new to Reddit and it seems to be an awesome community.  I want to start a post in this sub but don't know how. Could someone please help? Like my username says throwaway but I have determined I am a functional alcoholic and want to stop drinking.
