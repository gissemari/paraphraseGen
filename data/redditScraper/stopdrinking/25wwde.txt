i heard this song today for the first time and it really spoke to me - so much so that it's difficult to listen to. it's about the singer's struggle with alcoholism. the video is interesting too. i just wanted to share it here because it's a beautiful song and i thought others might relate too. ..https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vjPBrBU-TM

Good song. I've added it to the [music wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/music).
