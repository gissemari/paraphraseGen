I'm in sober living right now and frankly I don't know what's keeping me sober. The shame associated with a relapse disappointing my family and the practical problems of being in sober living having moved across the country back to my home state to get sober and not having a place to go if I do start drinking again. I miss drinking a lot. Some of my dearest friends from out east just called me and I so badly want to move back and party with them. Fuck most of the time I was lying in bed alone nursing a handle by myself I miss that shit too. I know it's a bad idea but I feel like I'm stuck in sobriety even though I know that it's what is best for me and what I need. Any advice?

I only have 8 days. Last night my friend had a huge party with most of my friends and I couldn't go. So last night I went to a aa meeting it bored me to tears and when I got home I passed by three bars and two stores that sell beer. I was in pain o was sick and tired of drinking and sick of not drinking. So I cried I was so frustrated and I sat down and prayed then watched tv  and went to bed woke up feeling stronger and great because I didn't drink.  I called a firiend today he was so hungover. Then went to an aa meeting tonight and felt better. It will pass whatever I'm goong thorugh. But the cycle of drinking is not worth it anymore for Me. I wish you the best!
Do you want to be sober more than you want to drink?..I like you was torn between what loved ones and external situations wanted from me and what I wanted. They saw booze destroyed me but I wanted to continue being an intoxicated nut. Until I made the decision to get sober and do whatever I had to do to swing the pendulum in lasting favor the opposite way I lived in guilt shame and remorse. ..What do you truly want? If it's to get drunk that is okay. Just remember that jails institutions and death aren't as open to life - changing decisions. ..I think you're in a good spot and should just breathe right this moment. I did sober living 2x and today I am grateful for that experience. You'll be okay.
