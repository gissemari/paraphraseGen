Long story short I had supper at with my boss and his wife. Was offered wine and beer no less than 6 times and turned it down each time with a simple 'no thanks'. It would have been easy to accept and one beer wouldn't have hurt anything right (wrong!). ..I am super excited right now because my past relapses have all been due to not turning down drinks an a social situation.

Great job!! Every instance of self control makes you stronger and more prepared for future situations. 
Another sober day. Great rejoicing in the land!..What's the matter with people asking you six times?! (No answer required.)
i am two days sober. i have no idea how to resolve this issue especially in china where drinking is so vital to the business culture...edit: forgot to congratulate you sorry for my selfishness i guess that is why we are all here after all :(
Great job! Feels good don't it?
Well that's just extremely encouraging. It's a BIG problem for me and a real pickup to see someone handing off a really awkward situation like that. 
Congrats... That's a tough challenge I have been avoiding these situations but I know my day is coming. 
Nice work OP!  Now you know you can get past this when it comes up again.  
The drunker people get the more they'll offer too. Try to always leave yourself an escape route from the environment just in case!..Really proud of you for saying no well done. =)
