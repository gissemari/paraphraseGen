In the triple digits baby! ..* My post at [30 Days](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/55zimw/30_days_upsides_downsides/?st=iwp3icv4&sh=3b31c677) - Reward: got a Sodastream.* My post at [8 Weeks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/5acuvc/8_weeks_today_no_more_pink_cloud_tools_ive_found/?st=iwp3ia24&sh=17b9828d) - Reward: cleaned organized and spruced up my office / dressing room and got new bedding and a floating desk..* At 90 days my reward was a cross body bag that I was drooling over. ..Today I woke up sore from swimming and bought some bumblebee hair pins...a little trinket that I was eyeing and am sure no one would buy me for Christmas.  ..I'm holding steady at 25 pounds lost struggling with finding time to exercise and meditate. I've also found myself salivating over the idea of eggnog. I'm wanting some sugary fattening treats but still have a few pounds to lose before I really let myself enjoy those things.  ..Goals & tools for 2017: ..* Running my venue is about 100-120 hours of non-stop work a week. No joke. This week I'm training a new programming director publicist and a new bartender so the next couple of weeks will be a hectic blur. But once they're trained I'll be able to get at least one or two days off a week in the New Year and work on more self care..* Join the morning ice skating / coffee club.* Swim at least once a week.* FUCKING MEDITATE! WHY THE FUCK CAN'T I MEDITATE?!?!..Thanks /SD for being here and to everyone for sharing their experiences highs and lows! HAPPY HOLIDAYS!..

You deserve you-time and I love your goals for '17. ..Oh yea - the meditation thing?? I can't fucking do it either :).
Love this!! 
Trip-D man.  Nice.  FWIW - I can't mediate for more than a minute or to.  I substitute taking five deep breaths every once in a while throughout the day.  Helps take the edge off.
