*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!* ..---. .&gt; We need to forgive ourselves. For all the things we didn't do. All the things we should have done. You can't get stuck on the regrets of what should have happened.  (Mitch Albom Tuesdays with Morrie)..&gt; Accept what you are able to do and what you are not able to do. Accept the past as past without denying it or discarding it. Learn to forgive yourself and to forgive others. Don't assume that it's too late to get involved.   (Mitch Albom Tuesdays with Morrie)..Self-forgiveness and acceptance are things I've wrestled with. . Shame for my actions (hiding bottles and lying anyone?) denials of my struggles (I'm not an alcoholic I still have a job!)...  Morrie Schwartz saw it all so clearly.  Mostly importantly: "Love wins.  Love always wins."..---..**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**..I'm pledging myself to not drinking today and invite you to do the same...Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.. .It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours lets not drink alcohol!..---. .**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!. .What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up.. .**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.. .**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.. .---. .This post goes up at:. .    US - Night/Early Morning  .    Europe - Morning  .    Asia and Australia - Evening/Night..A link to the current Daily Check-In post  can always be found near the top of the sidebar...---

"Love always wins" - that so sums it all up doesn't it? No booze for me today [even though I locked myself out of the house by accident which turned into a *bit* of a big whoops lol. But a friend called my landlord and he came and broke in for me so I could get safely back in where the mineral water and such is...and my shoes and keys and phone...] No booze tonight either - will be playing with my big new upright freezer and doing kitchen-y stuff. And I won't be drinking with y'all tomorrow either.

I made it a week! I'm so freaking happy! I had an awful dream last night that involved me deciding to have 'just one drink' which quickly turned into a nightmare of totally falling off the wagon. I woke up this morning so proud and thankful for the choices I've made this past week and I honestly believe it was the universes' way of playing the tape forward for me to strengthen my resolve. Today more than ever I can say I will not be drinking

I made it one week! My sober buddy texted me drunk last night and told me she needs me to go to AA with her. It looks like I'll be doing that soon despite wanting to use /r/StopDrinking as my support system exclusively. If i don't drink that first drink i won't drink that fifth or sixth one that makes me blackout and act a complete fool. IWNDWYT  
IWNDWYT!!!!
I won't drink today.
55 days. Something clicked today. I love being sober again. No struggle no wishing I could moderate. I'm good. IWNDWYT!

Yesterday was day 3 and the cravings were physically painful. Such a difficult day especially compared to day 1 and 2. Today seems a bit better so far especially after waking up without hangover not going to drink today.
Oh man self forgiveness is a tough one for me. I'm working on it but some days it's just really hard to be kind to yourself... I will not drink with y'all today!
Been struggling with anger and being short-tempered lately; having trouble letting things slide off me and just be.  It's frustrating.  But at least I am not hungover or drunk which would make this like it does everything else worse.  I will not drink with you today.
I will not drink with you today. 
7 days down. Wasn't sure I'd make it this far but y'all have been the biggest help in me getting here. Thank you all and IWNDWYT!

I pledge to not drink with you today!

 Don't assume that it's too late to get involved. ..I needed to read that this morning...I will *not* be drinking with all of you today. Have a beautiful day everyone.
Went to the gym. I Will finish some stuff outside if the weather permits. Iwndwyt
Not drinking today!
Woke up feeling more refreshed than I'm used to. Also! I have 6am yoga tomorrow morning that I'm excited for. ..Some stresses do include fixing my relationship with my SO who said that we should take a break. Really hoping that tomorrow her and I have a good time. Keeping myself motivated by staying strict with schoolwork and also keep working out. When you're drinking and working out I feel like the gains are slower. So here's to looking a ton better in the future!..
Congratulations to all 100094 subscribers here now! Sorry but I will not be drinking with you today I'm gunna enjoy sobriety tonight. 
IWNDWYT

Today is gonna be stressful. Lots of work to catch up on plus I have to go look at apartments. But instead of rewarding myself with drinking once it's all done I'm gonna reward myself by making it to 3 sober days. IWNDWYT
Good morning.  Not drinking today 
I will not drink today.
I will not drink with you all today---it's Shivaratri Mardi Gras and Paczki day all at once! I'm lucky to have so much to celebrate.
Day 6 no idea how to get the day flair. And that's fine. All that matters is that the poison does not touch my lips. And I won't. Not because I can't. But because I CHOOSE for it not to. It has no control over me. I control it. We got this. Every day is a battle. Everyday is a chance to choose what's best for us. For us to reclaim our lives! I will not drink with you today! 
Another day full of possibilities except one. I will not drink with you today.
New to this.  I've been lurking a long time.  I quit yesterday.  Today i will not be drinking with you.
I swear on my life for the woman I love and the people I care about that I will not drink today or any day. I pray for the strength and guidance to abstain from this poison once and for all. I will not drink with you today!

Iwndwyt. Had temptations and opportunities but I'm still going strong.
I will not drink today!!
Not drinking tonight 
I'm not going to drink today
Checking in. Hopping back into my "good" routine seems particularly hard today. It would be so much easier to fall back into my "usual" routine but I won't.
I was at my favorite market today to get some Valentine's Day chocolate strawberries and flowers and saw my favorite seasonal coffee stout was out and the manager said he had a few held back for me. So I shared a photo of the release to a local beer group and said  didn't get any today so more for you!  Hard to do but worth it. I won't drink with any of you today!
Long post as I will use this place as my diary - to pinpoint my negative emotions. ..Today it was almost impossible to concentrate at work. Chat chat chat. At first my manager and co-worker were chatting for a loooong time in their native language that I don't understand. Then later on 2 people next to me started chatting. They spoke in our native language so I understood everything. But everything they talked about was garbage. I just couldn't take it. So annoying. I listened to the music the whole time but still was able to hear everything and I didn't want to put the volume so loud that I become deaf. ..I just don't understand how they can talk such a mindless shit during the work. I don't mind people talking at work about random things but it better be fun or interesting so then if they disturb me with their chat then I can at least be entertained. ..So yeah I just don't understand how hard it is to go to the hallway or to another room for a chat. ..Before work though I had a long lovely morning. Took my time getting ready cause I went to work later. I wish every morning was like that. ...After work I went to host a local study group. I made this study group for people who need to study/work on their project individually. It's also clearly stated in the study group's description. Anyway one person showed up. (Last week which was also first time I organised it then also one person showed up). The person who showed up this time totally pissed me off. He was quite flirty the whole time which made me annoyed and probably a bit passive-aggressive towards him. He totally didn't understand what the group is about and criticised it afterwards. It's okay that he criticised I don't mind I agree with the communication part I could be better organiser. Anyway I completely disagree with him when it comes to other points. I understand his viewpoint but that's not my study group's aim. My idea will probably fail and that's okay. But that's not enough of a reason for me to change the overall point of my group. ..What really upset me was that I tried to explain to him that I see where he is coming from I see what he means but that's not what I have tried to nor want to do. Maybe in the future I'll create a study group that is more specific and oriented on one thing but not now. That is not my aim at the moment I originally and still want to organise a study group where people can just study/work on their own thing. Later they can share what they have learnt. He said it has no point but I see a point so I will keep doing it until I get tired of it. ..That really upset me and made me really want some alcohol. It made me miss drowning my problems and negative emotions with alcohol. But because I know I need to find another way to deal with all of that then I was able to deal with my urge. ..It's my 4th day without a drink. IWNDWYT!!!
Later than usual checking in today but: I will not drink with you.
Damn almost forgot to check in today. Guess that means drink'n ain't been on my mind today. &lt;---- That's a Lie! Regardless I made it here to say:  "I CANNOT WAIT TO NOT DRINK WITH Y'ALL TODAY!"

Love does always win doesn't it? I will not drink with y'all today.

As I've said in posts... in the IRC... out loud.... this depression is kicking my ass. However I know alcohol is trying to trick me into thinking it can help when in fact it'll only make it worse...For that I will not drink with you today.

Another very strong day of sobriety.  My brothers in town and I actually drove him to 3 different bars and let him drink.  Felt like walking a dog unfortunately.  Nothing but water for this guy.
