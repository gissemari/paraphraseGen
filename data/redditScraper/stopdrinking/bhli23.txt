You guys are such an inspiration! I hope to get there one day! I'm still in the doubles and struggling to get out but once I do it's gonna be a celebration!

I might be alot of days ahead but you and I are still turning down the same drink.The first one..That's all we have to do for a much fuller enjoyable life. Congrats on 15 days. IWNDWYT 
Hope you hit 100 and get triples.
Every day sober is a celebration!
You'll get there if you believe you can. When I start to waver I remind myself alcohol is poison and I don't put poison in my body.
Two weeks + is a wonderful accomplishment. You inspire me!
Don't drink;..One day at a time...Don't die. ..You'll get there too!
I just hit 100 today! It feels like such an accomplishment. You'll get there too.
Just keep being a student of recovery and you'll get it!
