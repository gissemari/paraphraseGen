I've been riding my bicycle to the liquor store with less than two hours before I have to go to work. I wait tables and at my current job going in hungover and in a bad mood isn't an option. So I keep it rolling. After my first four ounce shot chased with cheap OJ my bowels are reminded that I'm still alive and I'm sitting on the toilet. Decided to look at my bank account and calculate the amount of money I've spent in the last month on alcohol related purchases. Mostly booze sprinkled with a light dusting of drugs and delivery food because I was too hungover and depressed to cook for myself. $600 in less than a month. $100 of which was probably cigarettes but still... Shit I could lease a brand new Mercedes for that much. This is fucked.

What do you think led to your relapse and what can you do differently this time?
So...... Whatcha lookin for my man?  Are you going to quit again? Are you asking for help or advice? 
You're back that is something. You can here and I don't think you did it so you could *not* get support...I understand pretty much everything you're saying here except I have a suggestion. You say you are riding a bike. Biking has been helping me immensely in my sobriety. Consider taking that bike PAST the liquor store past the next liquor store just keep riding until your legs give out. Exercise out the thoughts of drinking of anger or frustration just get out and get your mind someplace else. Don't dwell on this last month and the money you spent just yet but rather do something positive? Just a suggestion
Do you want to quit or just venting?
What can we do to help?
