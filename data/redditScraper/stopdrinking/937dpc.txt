I've posted a couple of times before but needed to share again since I'm feeling like I've got some momentum. 2 weeks ago I reached a peak in a relapse and finally told my wife what was going on. I told her about hiding the drinking and how much I had been drinking. It was a shock to her but she stood by me and supported me. I made the decision to expose my secret drinking habit. I then spent most of the day two Sundays ago in a hospital getting an IV and starting on a course of medication to get through withdrawals. ..Since then I have taken a leave of absence from work that was strongly supported by my boss started going back to AA meetings on a daily basis and for the first time began an intensive outpatient program that I am really enjoying. Yesterday exactly two weeks after I was laying in the hospital bed with the shakes and overwhelming anxiety and shame I completed my first ever half-marathon. ..I am truly amazed at how much better I feel physically after just two weeks of complete sobriety and making a decision to put recovery first especially before work. I have a long way to go and still get flashes of anxiety and guilt but I'm focused 100% on recovery and being there for my family. I know recovery is a rough road and can be a lifetime journey but I am so grateful to have the fortune to be able to be in recovery safe and healthy with a supportive family. ..I spent months bouncing back and forth from sobriety to relapse this year and lurked on this site a lot posting only a few times. For anyone who reads this I hope it gives some perspective on how even two weeks can really make a difference. Anything is possible if you put sobriety first in life.
