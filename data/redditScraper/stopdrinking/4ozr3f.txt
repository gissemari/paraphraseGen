Has anyone else done anything like this?.http://imgur.com/3V80e7V..I made a calendar of the year through this month (my intention is to stay sober for the rest of the month and the year obviously since I'm here). It's been helpful to visually see where my downfalls were (I knew the events but it's interesting to see how long each relapse lasted and how quickly I recovered and all that). Not sure if this is a healthy thing to do but I got a little obsessive over it this morning...

Very interesting.  May was kind of a hot mess huh?  And what do the orange days symbolize?..Anyway I like the idea of this sort of calendar.
Good job on trying to get this thing under control and it looks like you've had success!  With me though I have learned that I need to keep things extremely simple in recovery.  With sobriety I either AM or AM NOT sober.  There is no way I can be "sober most Days of the week".   I absolutely used to keep a tally just like this.  And at times I used to be very proud of only drinking 6 days out of 30.  And for people like us that is absolutely an accomplishment!  It really is and that is why I say good job.  You've made huge progress I'm guessing...The problem I ran into is that when I was sober 80% of the days I eventually convinced myself that it wouldn't be the worst thing If I dropped down to sober 75% of the days.  Then I'd think it could dip a little lower than 75% this week and I could just make up for it next week.  But then next week would come and I had already convinced myself that the real goal is to just be sober more than 50% of the days.  And so the cycled continued until I was again drinking all day everyday.....
