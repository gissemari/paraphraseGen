My badge is misleading - gotta message them to fix it...again.  Disappointed in my (major) relapse and my return to hiding bottles but I will keep trying.  I hopefully will get my license back soon (found not guilty on 2nd dui but DMV still has my license  boo!). Then I can start up my hot yoga again which helps me a lot. For now though the only priority is not picking up that bottle. ..IWNDWYT

Hot yoga helps me a lot too! Good luck you can do this! IWNDWYT!
Welcome back!..IWNDWYT ..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Glad you're back!!
Welcome back!!!.We got this!!!..What is hot yoga??
A 90 min class in 104 degree heat and high humidity. It sounds like torture and it is during the class but I've never felt so good after!  And it burns a ton of calories. Look up Bikram Yoga!!
