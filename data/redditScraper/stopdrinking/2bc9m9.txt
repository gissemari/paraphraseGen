Today I am one year sober.  Thank you to everyone here who helped me through those very difficult times.  (I deleted my original account in a fit of paranoia.)  ..Not only do I feel better than I've ever felt -- I've gotten to know myself as well.  I'm going to use the tools that I've developed to build a wonderful healthy sober life...To all of the lurkers and people who are struggling today I'd like to share a quote that helped me get through some of the darker days:..Courage doesn't always roar.  Sometimes courage is the quiet voice at the end of the day saying "I will try again tomorrow".

Congrats on 1 year and thanks so much for sharing the quote! 
Congrats!  I am thankful for the courage that has seen me through the last 57 days.
365 days sober is a DINO Rawr!  
Thanks for the quote.  Today I faced something that to others would probably seem small but to me was a huge source of anxiety.  Having faced it proactively I feel proud of myself--it's not a roar just a sense of having done what I said I would do for once and not run away.
Yeah quiet voice at the end of the day!  Awesome news!  Congrats!
Man I love seeing that 365 next to people's names. Right on!
Congrats! I will keep that quote in mind... thanks for sharing it.
Quiet courage is the best kind :)
