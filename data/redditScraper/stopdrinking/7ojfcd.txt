So I've been sober for well over a year now and I just got back from 2 weeks in Cusco Peru a good time to wake up at a crazy early hour and reflect on my life...First off I'm forever a part of the recovery community there acronyms that end with "A": AA NA CoDA Al-Anon. The love support and connection I get from these groups had been utterly invaluable. (If you're quitting and DON'T go why would you try to swim with one arm tied behind your back? I'm an atheist and openly declare the universe as my higher power and never feel judgement for this)..Next up how much better my life is! All the stuff that I used to hide from avoid living with by squirming around like sleeping in a bed with pieces of barbed wire in I've fixed or am busy working on! I have every confidence that while life will never be perfect or ideal I can will and do work to make things better everyday. I can trust that my future will be far better this way! Part of this is the 12 steps from the programs combined with the stubborn willingness to do them do the work and put out the effort during time that I used to spend alone drinking. Miraculous!..When I got drinking I researched the best way to quit. Alcoholism is a terrible terrible disease with a morbidly low success rate of quitting so I looked for anything out there to improve my success rate. And I found The Sinclair Method with an almost 80% success rate. It is a medical-based process that works by chemically extinguishing the pathways in your mind that cause cravings and within a few months I was blown away: I simply don't struggle with cravings for alcohol the wine aisle at the grocery store is only interesting for the fact that it no longer is etc. I have the oversight of my therapist and my doctor.  For my own purposes I've defined sobriety as not drinking at all or following the Sinclair Method exactly. After over a year alcohol is something I simply don't struggle with. Miraculous!..Today my thoughts are primarily on authenticity and relationships. Some time ago working on my 12 step programs I discovered that I am codependent in my romantic relationships and started working on that as well. In today's meditation I see better how much this has sabotaged all my relationships including work friends family and workmates as well as romance. I don't yet know exactly how I'm going to change things for the better but seeing the problem is there first step. ..Feeling reflective sobriety has been wonderful for me! Have a great day!..I will not drink with you today.
