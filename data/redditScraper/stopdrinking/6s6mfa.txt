Hi all I'm just having a bit of a problem inside my own head. The thing is this isn't the first time I've "quit drinking." I'd be sober for a week or two sometimes a month but I'd always relapse. ..I guess I'm just not sure how to convince myself and those around me that I really mean it this time. What if this just turns into another relapse? ..I guess the only way to get there is one day at a time. I will not drink today.

Due to chronic relapsing I joined AA. Never thought I would but it's working so far. 
You pick yourself up and carry on...Slipping is part of recovery it happens. It's when we give up and decide we can't beat it that's when you fail...You got this stay up!..Won't be drinking with you today.
What he just said. I just started a new post op and its not far off from yours. You are not alone.
