My best advice for relapse is this: The first time I tried to stop drinking I relapsed because I thought I could handle it. And I wasn't doing it for myself. ..The second time I stopped I never truly  stopped  I just hid it from everyone and pretended like I was  good ... eventually made it a little bit of time without a drink...The 3rd time I relapsed my entire life I mean everything I ever worked for or loved fell apart in front of me. The disease convinced me to not care or try any more. None of it mattered because I just stayed drunk and high. For 32 days to be exact. I did nothing else but continue to make my life worse every waking moment of those 32 days...I ended up in inpatient care across the country. Went through terrible withdrawals. I came home with an 8000 medical bill a 5000 lease contract that I broke. Facing disciplinary action for my dream job I worked my butt off for. 90% of my friends gone. Lost my dog. The person I truly loved. Her family who was basically my family. Any sort of dignity or respect I had is gone. My life is completely flipped upside down...I can say it until I'm blue in the face but it won't register for most until it's too late to turn back...If you're on this thread and have identified a problem with your alcohol intake. You will eventually end up in a life changing situation that you truly don't want to be in. I understand it isn't easy. I understand some days suck and all you want is that hot rush of a buzz. But believe me when I say this: sobriety is a very very small exchange for happiness and self worth. If you value yourself and those you love do not let some nasty tasting shit that literally has no benefit to life ruin it...Ask yourself if there's even ONE good event or consequence that has come from getting trashed. Truly think into it. What has alcohol really done for you? Any sort of benefit or positive that could've been reached the same way without it?.....I'll wait..I promise you if I could go back. I would change my behaviors and be proactive about my problems before it ever got to this point. But that isn't the case for me anymore. I chose my path and now I must live with the repercussions...Too little too late...I truly hope you stay on your path. Don't do what I did. ..It's not a nice place to be. ..Take care..-T

Such a powerful testament of your life thank you for sharing your story it's  sobering and profoundly relatable I'm so sorry things got so bad for you  sometimes we have to land on the bottom of life to find our way back and I truly wish this for you sad that you lost so much but if you can come back from the abyss of alcoholism you will rise again and have a different but good life again I send you my heartfelt good wishes and a big hug to you friend gid bless 
This was really eye opening. Thank you for sharing. 
I can so so relate to your post/experience.  I did pretty much the same.  I will save this post for frequent re-reading because my mind forgets how bad things got... and they only get worse (the consequences and misery) each time I relapse.  Thank you for posting this. 
Man I can't help but see myself reading this desperately makes me want to change my life around. I know I need it but thank you for you're courage and honesty.  I needed that and Congrats to moving forward 
Thank you. Your story is powerful and helpful. I'm sorry you endured so much. Iwndwy
Well written and very profound. Thank you for this.     
Tomorrow is payday but I'm feeling cautiously optimistic..but this post was a huge motivator. Thank you! IWNDWYT
Thank you for this reminder. It helps more than you know 
"I can say it until I'm blue in the face but it won't register for most until it's too late."..That is so true. Sad but true. Alcoholism is like a series of doors. Behind each door is progressively darker scarier room. ..Right before you open each door in the chain you hear the muffled voices of the alcoholics trapped inside the room yelling "Dude what are you doing? You don't want to enter here! It's bad."..But for some fucking reason one never quite believes them. They're being hysterical. The warnings don't apply to me...You keep going through room after room and the last door unlike the others is even marked with a huge sign "Do Not Enter! Catastrophe awaits you inside!"..By then you don't even fucking care.....
Thanks for sharing your difficult situation. It is a good reminder for me to stay vigilant. 
Its a progressive disease. Everytime you go back your lows will get lower until you find yourself in a place that you said you'd never be in.
definitely appreciate this share

&gt; **If you're on this thread and have identified a problem with your alcohol intake. You will eventually end up in a life changing situation that you truly don't want to be in.**..If you're on r/stopdrinking and questioning whether or not you have a problem with alcohol I can say with relative certainty that you do. ..I was a "slow learner" too; I'd get some time under my belt and then convince myself I was "cured."  Each time I thought I had hit rock bottom I'd go get more dynamite and dig myself in deeper.  I felt hopeless and had resigned myself to thinking I would die a drunk. I woke up every morning hating myself as my brain did battle with the demon over whether I would drink that day. I had lost all control and I didn't seem to care.  In August of 2015 I did in fact almost die a drunk.  Thirty-some years of abusing my body finally took its toll. ..Had I stopped in my Twenties when I knew I had a problem my life would have turned out a whole lot differently.  Two divorces financial and legal issues thousands of lost opportunities don't even begin to scratch the surface.  ..It is said "Rock Bottom is when you Stop Digging."  If you're new here keep coming back! Make the decision "No Not Today" as soon as you wake up and then do whatever it takes to make it happen. It really does get easier and a whole lot better!..Blessings..Shine~
Eye opener for me today and well needed. Thank you. 
Thank you for sharing your powerful story. I have great hope for you. As the saying goes you can't rewrite the beginning but you can change the ending.   I will gladly not drink with you today. 
ThankU!  I am 5 mos sober currently traveling in a hot n humid country now for 3 weeks and man do I want a beer!  My companion travelers don't drink and had kept me on track as I play the tape forward about why I'm in sobriety is because I have no off button so for today IWNDWUT! 
Thanks for this. Drank for the first time in 2019 on Saturday and still trying to pick up the pieces 48 hours later. I've had so many of these stops and starts that I'm just trying to take another lesson from this latest slip and not let things spiral out of control. This helped. Thank you. 
Wow your post is a real eye opener. Thank you so much!  I haven't reached rock bottom and honestly I don't want to reach it before deciding to do something about my drinking.  I don't want to lose everything it's not worth it. I'm back to day 1 and I hope I never have to start at day 1 again after today. 
Thanks for sharing! You have a powerful story and it was well written. I'm sure this is what someone needed to hear today. 
Thanks for this post. I've been fighting this for a long time and every time I stumble I cant tell if I'm getting closer to sobriety or closer to just saying fuck it and giving up entirely. I have so much cognitive dissonance about alcohol it's driving me insane. I won't drink today though.
Thanks for the post.  I can relate.  I drank for ***decades***.  I have been trying to stop for almost ***five years***...It is ***so*** hard to see the light when you are in the middle of a binge...I will not drink with you today.
Thank you for your words. I'm free and clear on alcohol but I'm still struggling with one last addiction and you really made me see it in a different light. There's nothing good that has ever come out of me using. It's just pushes my problems further down the line and prevents me from becoming my true self
&gt; What has alcohol really done for you? Any sort of benefit or positive that could've been reached the same way without it?..Thank you for sharing. This is one of those things I've been trying to remind myself of constantly lately. Whenever there's a particular mood I want to reach a certain emotional state a mode of thought a feeling a movement whatever I think  maybe a drink or two will help you get there.  But drinking only ever moves to stupidity or sadness and I'm always going to be much better off trying to get to that place organically. Even if I fail getting to these places or ways of being sober at least I'll have a clear memory of it and know what I need to work on. All alcohol has ever given me in the wake of failure is a vague sense of regret and sadness and a blurry memory of where I went wrong. 
In my experience the vast majority including myself learn this the hard way.
Thank you for posting this. I hope things work out for you. IWNDWYT
You'd think after I flatlined back in 2014 woke up in a hospital trying to rip the tube out of my throat and having seizures for a week straight  would be enough to stop me. IWNDWYT!
Thank you for posting this I have binged the last four days. My anxiety is through the roof but I am committing to not drinking with you today. I am so tired of lying to myself about how bad it is. It's theraputic just writing that. I commit to not drinking today I don't want to experience rock bottom. I commit to coming here every day and committing every day. 
bookmarking this.  so powerful.  thank you.
Thank you so much for sharing this and for your honesty and bravery.  I'll wait...' so powerful. On a very bad day for me so close to 100 this has helped me stay strong IWNDWYT 
So true.  Alcohol steals life.  I will not drink with you today.  Thanks for the share.
Hey man.  Thanks.  This helped more than you know.
Sweet!  If I can muster up the energy I'll hop on my treadmill. Almost no sleep last night and I'm losing steam quickly here at work. I can promise you no drinking tonight and I look forward to tomorrow! No hangover and having you check in on me. Thank you so much!
What do you think the essence of the problem is I mean alcohol is just a thing right. I recognise that there could be a genetic element and you can consider alcoholism a disease but what is the thing that we do that can lead us down these paths. Is it not owning up to the present again and again solving every problem with  I can just have a drink later'?
I love your honesty. Very similar feelings about my relapse. I haven't lost everything YET but I had over 2.5 yrs of sobriety like 1.5 yrs ago (so depressing I haven't done the math yet). Things were great but I didn't realize it. I got bored with the "feeling" of pride in myself and from others. The newness of sobriety and security wore off for me. It seemed as if everyone else was so sure I was "fixed" that they never really thought I would start back on the bottle. I thought I was fixed too....it infected my psyche....made me question the lengths I had to go to stay sober. I quit going to mtgs....felt I had nothing else "genuine" to say. All I saw in other AAs was either the same old shit fake enthusiasm true newcomer enthusiasm one-upsmanship etc.....judgement and comparing crept into my view of others. I was either jealous of other people or thought they were pieces of garbage. No in-betweens. I quit meditation quit praying and I allowed my perceived personal and professional shortcomings to rule my attitude. I'm at work now tearing up while typing this. My relationship with my God was at a standstill because I felt that we both knew I was a fraud. I realized my feelings were betraying my intentions and I buckled under this self-imposed pressure. I thought to myself it was just some weed....later it was just some shrooms....just a beer.....then I was terrified and panicked....eventually succumbing to chugging bottles while driving home from work. Yelling at my kids for things that are in reality simple annoyances....I saw these annoyances as personal attacks....I pushed everyone away from me under the guise of either rage or pity. My wife went back to feeling like an idiot because she'd taken me back....over and over....my kids lost any shred of respect they grew for me. I'm still hating myself for what I willingly walked away from... healthy and happy stability...the exact thing I yearned for but never got as a kid. Here I am now 30 lbs fatter much broker short on friends and respect  longing for love....the same love that I took for granted the second I lost my humility and fight with alcohol. Not only do I suffer from alcoholism I suffered from an expectation that some chemicals would remedy my pain. It was hell to keep trying and failing. It's embarrassing. It's disgusting. It's terrifying....all the nights waking up at 2 and 3.....my whole body jolting up supine fractured memories rushing into my mind....of how I failed again....the things I said the people I called the things I SCREAMED....the delusions I wrapped myself and others in. The shame and the weakness I had buying another bottle damn near every day....knowing I was defeated....but maybe it wouldn't be THAT bad THIS time....surely that was the same thing my wife and kids were telling themselves on their way home to me after their own busy tension-filled days. All the hate I felt towards people who I thought had it SO EASY. It was and still is terrifying....if it wasn't I'd most likely still be drinking (with a paltry little more than 5 days under my belt). I wrecked my car twice broke a window out of my grandmother's car I was driving while mine was being fixed had to go to court because I yelled bloody murder at a cop missed several days at work missed several holidays birthdays sporting events opportunities to patch things up with family &amp; friends on and on and on..............Why the fuck was I doing this to myself and my family?  So help me God I didn't even like the drinking. My attitude was garbage and it was dictating my reality.  I promise you all this (as you well know)....there is a God....there are real miracles....for today I am blessed with another chance to mend what I have shattered. I realize this and I will not take it for granted. I've been blessed with this knowledge and I will NOT squander it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FUCK NO IWNDWYT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thanks so much for this. In midst of a storm today.. IWNDWYT
iwndwyt. 
Thanks so much for writing this. Today I wanted to drink so bad. I slept like shit last night and I'm pretty stressed from busting my ass at work the gym building some programming projects and studying for a certification test I had been putting off because I was drinking too much after work. I told myself I would just have a little. I told myself I deserved it. Luckily I didn't drink after work and this post drives home why that was such an important decision...I've been where you are and I personally know how much that shit sucks. I really hope everything works out for you. You got this!
Truly helpful thank you for this.
Thanks for you honesty and posting. I couldn't bear to lose my dog. Ever. I would move heaven and earth to keep him.
Thanks this is very relatable.  Last 10 years have been a very slow downward spiral for me hope I can finally break it.
Thank you. I lost 90% of my friends my money my house too thanks to addiction. Now I'm at ground zero and rebuilding.
