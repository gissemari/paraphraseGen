I'm still feeling the 4:00 rage and nearly caved for a cocktail tonight. Everything felt on the line and I gritted my teeth through it and made it to the other side of the urge. But what a struggle. I'm exhausted thinking this could go on for the rest of my life. It feels like work that will never end. Just needed to throw that out there. A little frustrated but still encouraged. I can do this.

You can certainly do this. I think the worst struggle for me was just before hitting 100 days. The excitement of a new life was gone and anxiety about the future and thinking of what I will do to deal with stress (not alcohol) set in. Now I'm mostly calm and settled into sobriety... though not perfectly. The urge is still there but it is a quiet voice and only speaks when I have a bad day. But that urge is quickly gone. I think others will say the same about the struggle getting easier but maybe never going away. It is okay though. Funnily enough I find stength in having the strength to resist...Anyway I hope hearing this about my story helped you.
Good job on not caving! 
&gt;I'm exhausted thinking this could go on for the rest of my life. It feels like work that will never end. ..I relate to this a shitload.  I am getting nothing new or exciting or beneficial out of sobriety other than slight weight loss.  My life being free of hangovers makes it marginally more manageable but that's it...Losing a ton of motivation by the day and I feel myself counting down until I just give up entirely.  At the very least it won't be tonight.
I had my first real white knuckle period today.  I just kept thinking  this will pass  and it did.  I ate a ginormous salad instead.
