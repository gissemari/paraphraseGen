I've been sober since February 13th 2017...I relapsed last Fall after having been sober over a year.  I put on 20 lbs and wasted a lot of time and money.  ..I think there's a couple reasons I screwed up.  I stopped taking my antidepressants and I hate Winter so so much...I don't really know what I'm thinking right now.  My husband quit smoking on Saturday.  It kind of hit me that I should probably kick myself in the ass...The scary part is that I really didn't embarrass myself.  Looking back I can't think of a night that I really overdid it.  I almost feel like a responsible drinker but I know I have a history.  History repeats and I know this.  ..I can totally see where I'd get sucked back into thinking I can be normal and then crash and burn.

Welcome back. I'm not drinking with you today.
Hi Andrew I remember you!  Nicely done on dusting yourself off and thinking that not drinking actually may hold a better life for you...I remember you were pretty active on here - Will you be chatting with us more regularly again?
Yeah been there done that.  It's a sneaky sneaky thing these thoughts.  I really struggle with them myself...But your back. I will not be drinking with you today. 
Welcome back. 
Glad you're back. "Responsible" relapses can be pretty awful- rather than getting hit with a ton of bricks it's like carrying another pound every day and slowly getting squashed. I won't drink with you today.
