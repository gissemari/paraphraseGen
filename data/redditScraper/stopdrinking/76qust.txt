Well I'm pregnant and my BF and I have decided to have the parenting adventure. I'm cautiously optimistic (I have a doc's appt this week and I'm reserving judgement until we see if the baby's okay and developing okay I'm an older almost danger-zone first time mom). .My "first world problem" is that pregnancy is kind of reversing my "sober gains". .I can't take my maintenance meds for my skin so I have breakouts which is really messing with my head I've gained a few and worst of all I feel hungover every day! The wooziness the extreme tiredness and lack of energy the junk food cravings the lassitude. I hate it!! I realize it's "for a good cause" but it's really making me miserable and frustrated. .I'm coming up on 2 months and I'm very very sure I made the right choice and I can't go back even if I wanted to (which I don't) but come on body!! Work with me!!

Congrats! What you are experiencing is the 1st trimester yuckiness. Everything in your body goes haywire your absolutely EXHAUSTED &amp; you don't even look pregnant! ..I can tell you that around the start of the 2nd trimester everything gets a LOT better! Your energy comes back skin clears up....&amp; you look pregnant so people treat you wonderfully haha! ..Just ride out the next few weeks &amp; things will start getting better. 2nd trimester is a bit of its own pink cloud! ..Enjoy the pregnancy! It really is a magical time!
It does get better in the 2nd trimester. You will constantly worry about your weight and skin issues (I did with both my pregnancies) but it all goes away surprisingly fast after you have the baby. I gained like 60lbs with both of mine and lost it in about 6 months. For me after having the baby was the really hard part. I don't want to get you down I just want you to be prepared. I got depressed and my alcoholism came to a peak. I am just now admitting this and changing my life. Being a parent is so hard and so many other moms told me they deal with it by drinking wine. It became synonymous with "cool mom that I can bond with". Just keep sobriety as your goal and you will be fantastic mother!
