Wow. I'm feeling great this morning because I didn't fall for the trick of alcohol. Proud! Just a regular stress but difficult week with covering double usual work due to a sick colleague and in laws visiting and kitchen is mid renovation. Nothing serious but a lot of exhausting stress and at about 50 days I thought  I'm just going to have a glass of wine to relax.  I had to really struggle to remember how crappy it really feels after the first 30 minutes. Really it's like 30 min of  fun  followed by hours of fog and shame because it's almost certain I would end up having the bottle and hiding it. So I just finished my work at 12 am and went to bed and at 6 am when I work I felt super proud. This is important. I need to consciously savor how good it feels to not have drank and to be sober and proud. Whew! Boring read to most of you but it feels important to put it out there.

Thank you for sharing. iwndwyt
Not boring at all to me at 100+ days I still occasionally have those moments and conversations with myself.  In retrospect I wish I would've written down how shitty I felt when I was drinking because I'm afraid that one day I'm gonna forget and fall for the trick...Good for you and congrats. ..IWNDWYT 
Thanks for the reminder. I have one memory that had y stuck with me for all these years and that you just triggered again. I was driving home from school and stopped to get a bottle of vodka. I started drinking it in the car on my way home and started to catch a nice buzz. I shit you not the pleasant sensation lasted no more than 10 minutes before the feeling became anesthetic-like and not in a good way. Just numb. It was really sad because after that numb feeling took over I couldn't stop. Anyway thanks again for the story - it was a really good reminder.
