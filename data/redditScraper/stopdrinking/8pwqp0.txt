I'm annoyed. I stopped drinking a while ago as did my husband. We have been working on some relationship stuff and secluded ourselves from the world. Today is our first time out with our friend. Here we are at his house with his roommates and some strange girl I have never met before. Besides just being annoying as hell she keeps talking about her drinking binges. I'm struggling big time because I'm uncomfortable and stuck in the situation for another couple hours. Encouragement please!!!
