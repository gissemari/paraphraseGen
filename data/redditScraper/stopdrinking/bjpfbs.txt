Day 3 after countless relapses the most recent after learning that a close relative died last week. Today is testing me hard - cronyism left me passed over for a good opportunity at work my boss's boss made a personal insult about me to my peers without realizing i overheard them and I was forced to take on a burdened shift.  I'm a relatively accomplished professional in my mid thirties and it feels like every decision I've made recently is wrong...Except for one: I will not drink tonight. I'm in control and tomorrow won't be any better if I end today at the bottom of a glass

You are so right nothing good comes from drinking. Go you on day 3! Hang in there! IWNDWYT
Just keep knocking each and every day down and before you realize it you'll be free from the beast of burden called alcohol. IWNDWYT
I can relate to everything you said about work and that is one of the hard things for me. I no longer have that  f - it and just have a beer  escape. Still even with the pain of facing things life is better sober.
I am sorry for your bad day I had a bad day too but we both did not drink so at least a bad day didn't turn into a terrible morning. Alcohol is really good at making things worse under the guise of making things better. IWNDWYT.
