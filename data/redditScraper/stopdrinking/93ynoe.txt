How many times have I been here? Morning after tossing and turning in the wee hours - sipping on water until I heave up what's left in my stomach...In the last 6 months ive been sober way more than I've been drunk. Made it weeks without a drop and feeling like I've turned a page...Last night I was caught off guard by some raw emotion I have relating to my father and I drank. I recently discovered he's struggled with methadone addiction for his entire life...I'm back on the horse this morning. Reset my counter and this time I wanna make it to 100 and then keep going! I've spent enough mornings feeling like shit and I don't want to waste any more mornings feeling this way!

Glad you are staying the course. Consider listing what is working and what might need to change. Hang in there. 
That sucks! I spoke to my father on the phone last night and he sounded wasted and it was so upsetting...I'm sorry hear about this and I hope you feel better soon. You can do it! IWDWYT 
I can still vividly remember that feeling and I never want to do that to myself again...
