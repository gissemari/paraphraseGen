This is a story I read and I am not sure where. It may have been right here on reddit a few years ago. If you know the story I apologize if some details are not perfectly correct as I am going from memory but the basic story still is true...A woman who struggled with alcoholism was at an airport for an outgoing flight but the flight was delayed. Now airports and their bars are triggers for many drinkers and she was no exception to that. She was upset about the flight delay and had hours of time on her hands. She was a regular attender of AA but could not reach her sponsor and was too new in it to know others to call. She sat outside an airport bar wrestling with what to do. Finally she walked to an airport phone and asked the operator to please page Bill W. and ask him to meet her in front of the bar. (For those who don't know about AA Bill W. is the deceased founder of it and the author of The Big Book.) In very little time a half dozen people showed up to support her and more kept coming. She was overwhelmed with support and successfully put that drinking temptation behind her.

True story!  It happens all the time 
That is beautiful.
Long before knowing about AA and Bill W I was at a convention hotel that had a large poster outside one of the meeting rooms.  A lot of well-dressed people were inside.  The poster said "Friends if Bill W." And I thought "Gee Bill W has a *lot* of friends."  And he does. 
Around the Globe!
I'll add that to my tool box.
