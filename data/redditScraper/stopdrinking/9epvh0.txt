The past 2 months have been incredibly difficult. Memories of a deeply troubled self-centered and arrogant person are beginning to surface; things long since locked away and forgotten. It feels like remembering someone else's past...I want to thank everyone here for the encouraging posts comments and resources through this difficult time. You've helped me start to piece together the wreckage of my past and be gain the confidence to build a future controlled by dreams instead of drugs. To anyone struggling with their sobriety: you CAN do this!

Sober On!
Completely get you here.  The more sober I get the more memories surface about shit I've done that in nit proud of.  They happened.  Instead of drown them with alcohol I'll face them then figure out how to do enough good to make up for them.  Great job in your progress
