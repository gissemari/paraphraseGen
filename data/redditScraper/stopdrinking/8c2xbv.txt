I have this guy that I'm really into. Apparently years ago while a big group of us were staying at a lake house I went to wake him up one morning after I'd been drinking all night and he kissed me. I was blacked out; I completely forgot about it. He didn't tell me until years later after I hit on him at a friend's wedding. ..I've been struggling a bit lately. I even went to some AA meetings but I don't think it's for me. Our viewpoints are too incompatible although everyone was super nice and welcoming. I do know I'm not going to let alcohol take anything else from me like it took that first kiss.

Oh damn....Alcohol the great remover. ..I have behaviour in my drunk past that still makes me cringe. .You are *not* alone. ..Have you explored SMART recovery? Or LifeRing? Having IRL help helped me enormously.
