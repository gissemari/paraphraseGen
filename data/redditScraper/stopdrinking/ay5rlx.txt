Today I listened to a song written by Owl John (Scott Hutchison.).  He struggled with depressed and anxiety throughout his life until he ended his own life last May.  The song is titled  Los Angeles Be Kind .  There is a line in the song that talks about motiv s behind his drinking.  He wrote .. Oh Los Angeles be kind.No more trouble or red lights.I can learn to love you in due time.Oh Los Angeles be kind..I read you all wrong.So I get drunk just to feel I belong.By a river so dry it's barely a river at all ..I drank my whole life to feel like I belonged.  This song made me cry.  However it reminded me how far I have come on my sobriety journey.  Pregaming before social events and drinking to relieve my social anxiety became my MO.  Now I am comfortable in my own skin.  My question is why did it take me 56 years to figure that out and how the bell did it hit me through this sad but true story about a Scottish transplant trying to fit in LA.  I drank a lot to fit in.  I also drank alone to avoid people.

I did the same! Now I am learning to love and accept myself just the way I am without having to fit into anyone else's expectations.
Stay dry!!!  
Thank you for sharing this song and your story. I also drank to feel like I belonged or to lessen social anxieties but it only ever left me feeling more alone isolated and anxious. Since I stopped drinking I haven't socialized much and when I do I feel awkward but I am learning to find comfort in the discomfort. I hope this gets easier with time. ..I recently lost a person I love to alcohol and suicide. I've lost friends and loved ones before but nothing hurt as bad as losing him. He was talented and kind and one of the most lovely people I have ever known. This song made me think of him.
