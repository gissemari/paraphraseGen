On my day 5 after a week long relapse. Feels great to be sitting here with only a water in my hand after a rather stressful day at work. So happy to be back on the right path! Thank you SD for keeping me positive when the day is troublesome!

Congrats on day 5 and welcome back! Are you going to do anything differently this time?
