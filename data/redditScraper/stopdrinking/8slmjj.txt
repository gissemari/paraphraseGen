I caved after 6 days. I didn't drink a lot (few beers and a half pint). I am not hungover made it work etc but I woke up with the regret of drinking for no reason at all...The best part is that I didn't enjoy it at all. I say it's the best part because it strengthens my resolve to know it's not worth it at all. ..I've been a serial-relapser so far but each time I go longer drink less and feel more strong...IWNDWYT

You are here that is important. I am back at day 1 myself and IWNDWYT!
But you've learned something important which you can now use in your new sobriety. I know it's frustrating but you can use this to help you avoid similar pitfalls in the future. It's a lesson many of us have to learn for ourselves . We hear about it  of course but for many of us the truth doesn't sink in until we try it ourselves (we trick ourselves into thinking that  it will be different for us; we're not the same as those other people ). ..Be kind to yourself.

&gt; I didn't enjoy it at all..Yeah mate once you start realising you don't actually *enjoy* being a drunkard it really does get easier...I've been on and off the wagon too but don't worry you can pull yourself together and say: I will not drink with *you* today!
Sometimes the mere habit of drinking all the time compels you to drink even when you really don't even \*want\* to. Even when you know you wont enjoy it.   ...What I told myself during these times is that I just have to make it through some sincerely uncomfortable and potentially dark moments and just \*endure\* them to get to the other side. Sometimes it can be a bit of a waiting game but it is worth it. Good for you for not beating yourself up. The only way to succeed is to keep trying :)
try for 10 days this time  then keep going!  it gets harder at first.  serial relapse here
