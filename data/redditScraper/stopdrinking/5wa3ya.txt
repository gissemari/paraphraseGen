So ye i finally went i have been trying to quit since my last relapse in march last year. Really i dont want to be here but its the best decision i can do for my self. Its a cool place though we are only 9 guys here in the middle of a 1 mil city we get buspasses and access to a nearby gym. Could be alot worse based from stories ive heard. ..Mentally im sort of annoyed not sure why really i hope it passes. Sleeping has been waay better no waking up every 2 hours got 6 hours straight last night wich was really nice. ..Anway I wont escape rehab with you today!...

Congratulations!  Look forward to hearing more about your journey.
Great job on getting through this. I recently read "Do something today that your future self will thank you for." You will definitely thank yourself for this later.
Best wishes.  I won't drink with you today.
They gave you computer privileges that quickly. Holy shit. I was on blackout for the first week and didn't get on the computer until two weeks before I left.
