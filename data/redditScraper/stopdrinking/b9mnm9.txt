Congrats on getting to day 4! Day three was always the hardest for me. I call that moment serenity when you realize you haven't thought about the substance in x hours or days or weeks or years. I had that moment recently I quit smoking again a few months ago and I was on this road trip and just thought "You know I haven't wanted or thought about nicotine in about a month. How fucking nice is that?". Keep up the good work friend :)
