----------immediate responses--------

Only Tuesday night for me. Time to sleep. Have a great Wednesday 
**Struggle**: Some very emotionally draining fights with my boyfriend this week about our future. ..**Triumph**: I was extremely triggered and did not drink. ..**General**: Whatever pink cloud I had is definitely over. But I'm still sober and have been able to face confrontation and disappointment without drinking this week. 
Struggle: Its my 4th day sober since my last binge and I had a crap sleep drifting in and out of nightmares soaked in sweat...Triumph: got out of bed nice and early sipping a coffee and got time for a shower before I need to leave my house!..General: - Im based in scandinavia and we passed the darkest time of the year now the days getting longer and longer and soon enough the spring will be here:)
Struggle:it's been a week of moodiness &amp; bickering at home &amp; yet more icy weather this morning  ..Triumph:I've been sober for a week! Feeling better everyday sleeping WELL &amp; positivity is flowing..General:I don't need to wash my hair this morning so I can stay in bed a bit longer.
Struggle(s): another crazy work week of deadlines. I've been pounding coffee just to survive. I've got a compressed nerve making things worse and preventing me from working out. In the exhausted state I snapped at my SO for something I shouldn't have with such quick anger as if was drinking. Ugh where is Friday when you need it!?..Triumph: Not drinking and not even tempted whatsoever! Temperament is getting better and better...General: Weather is becoming mild almost spring-like. I'm starting to look forward to yard work and gardening..
**Struggle:**  I had the worst cold starting last Friday.  Bad headaches fever stuffed up sore throat thing that's still lingering a bit.  Then today I mess up my neck and back maybe doing pushups last night maybe I just slept on it wrong.  Either way it's lame...**Triumph:** It's snowing and a lot!  I doubt I can take full credit for this meteorological event but whatever.  We only get snow about once a year where I live if that.  The kid in me loves it.  Because it's rare most people aren't prepared to drive in it and mostly we just have snow days.  I'll probably stay home and play with the kids if my back is better...**General:** My life long goal is to be successful and/or clever enough to spend January and February in Mexico every year.  
*Struggle(s)*: Freelancing. Chasing down payments being broke in between. Applying to jobs. It's tiring and sometimes discouraging. Drank yesterday. :( My entire weekly limit (14 units) in a night. Ugh. ..*Triumph*: Getting fit! Running doing yoga working out. Feeling great about that. It lessens my dependence on alcohol. ..*General*: It's beautiful here this time of year. My neighbourhood has lots of cute birds and dogs and beautiful trees that are in bloom. I'm loving it. 
Struggle: anxiety ..Triumph: 50 days!..General: woke up at 5 am today for no apparent reason!
**Struggle:** Both me and the mrs have very uncertain job situation. We both have applied for new jobs this week and we both sorely need it...**Triumph:** I ve passed on alcohol several times lately without thinking much about it...**General:** We took our four year old skiing for the first time last week. On her first real trip 45 minutes or so she proved to be such a fighter. Fell over and over without crying raced like a champ down the hills and at the rest halfway through with buns and hot chocolate she was just as eager to continue. At the end she proudly concluded that she was much better at this than she thought she was. She truly inspired me to keep fighting gracefully. I too am better at this than I thought I was!
**Struggle**: Until I have a couple of years of sober stability I need to step away from my 12yr old daughters life - she has a wonderful life &amp; knows that I love her but I cause her far too much pain confusion &amp; chaos with my instability &amp; "disappearing" from her life &amp; my own....**Triumph**: For the last 3 weeks I have been consistent in attending meetings &amp; keeping appointments with support people. I am reconnecting with great sober friends inviting those friends into my home going to their homes &amp; doing fun activities with them! *But my greatest triumph this week has been coming back to my life saving home with my friends here at SD*  The greatest gift I could give myself  ..**General**: I am grateful to be alive even amid absolute heartbreak  
Struggle: every week I find out about someone else I know who is having problems quitting alcohol. Trying to work out how to best help them. I know you can't save everyone but then I also feel this weird duty of care because they need to feel how good this sober is. But then who the fuck am I to know what needs doing. ..Triumph: 49 days and coasting. I feel so much less stressed at work so much less chatter and anxiety in my brain...General: I think I have a new crush at work and it's highly amusing to me meditating on how my reptile brain works. I shouldn't act on it and very likely won't but it's fun having somewhere for that mental energy to go. 
Sorry you're going through that Mary. In addition to Mom's urine on the floor I get the added bonus of vomit :/. ..**Struggle:**    Went to Town Hall to get a copy of the record stating that my sister went behind my back and *stole* Mom's entire estate. Her name is on the house in black and white...**Triumph:**    Cried yesterday because of yet another kick to the gut from sister. Then got myself prepared mentally and started calling lawyers. Karma? Yea. It's gonna be a real fucking bitch ;)...**General:**    I made a comment on here about going to the gym first thing in the AM. Yesterday I went and blared "In The End" and worked my fucking ass off. The *POWER* behind that stuff? Amaaazzzing :)..
My first WUW!.Struggle: Experiencing emotions I've not allowed myself to for awhile Overwhelmed..Triumph: I didn't drink and practised self-care. .General: There's alot I can't control in my life right now. But I choose not to drink today. 
Struggle: Getting locked out of my apartment today and going through crazy moods swings because of my bipolar disorder...Triumph: Recognizing my emotions are temporary and they don't dictate my actions. Also not using getting locked out as an excuse for drinking...General: Excited for February to come to an end so it can finally start getting into the rainy season for where I live. I love the rain.
**Struggle** I'm sick of my job and my coworkers...**Triumph** 29 days baby! ..**General** Worked on updating resume yesterday. Not real hopeful about finding a new job because in this small town there are very few jobs that pay decently that I'm qualified for but I'm giving it a shot. 
Struggle:  I entered a weight loss competition and I'm 20lbs short with 20 days left. Damn I really hoped to win $$ and meet my goal.  ..Triumph: I'm motivated to put some work into not drinking this time and make a plan. ..General: its going to be like 75 degrees. In NYC. In  February.  
Struggle: learning how to better deal with frustration and how to set boundaries for myself...learning when to say "No" to projects instead of feeling obligated. A lot of memories from childhood have been coming up lately and sometimes they can be overwhelming but I'm learning how to not shut down because of them...Triumph: 45 days and counting! I don't think I've been sober for this long since high school. And every day feels better still. I think it's around this time that I relapsed over the summer but this time around I really have no desire to drink...no question in my mind saying "Don't you think you can go back for just one?"...General: Holy cow is this weather doing wonderful things for my mood. The birds are singing the windows are open for the breeze it's staying lighter out later and later! All in all it feels incredible. Thankful for this community and all the positivity.
*Struggle:* Some new positive plans for the future have for some reason (???) given rise to some romanticizing thoughts of drinking. ..*Triumph:* Shared thoughts with my husband who was kind and supportive while also helping me debunk those ideas reminding me of all I (we) have gained. I don't always share with him because he still drinks and I wonder if he'll "get it." But he did perfectly. Feeling sturdier now. ..*General:* Had to turn on air conditioner last night to make it cool enough to sleep. ..
**Triumph:** My diet is back on track and I'm sleeping loads better! Even though work is a bit of a slog I'm settling into my routine effectively...**Struggle:** I've been re-evaluating my finances and for the first time in my life my bank account was overdrawn. It was a terrible feeling but fortunately it was in the single digits and the only consequence was an overdraft fee. It was a nice wake-up call to curbing my ordering take-out and putting my long-term goals of getting a cat and building a computer on hold...**General:** I wish I could erase Black Panther from my memory so I could see it again fresh. What a movie!
Struggle - I am just not finding enough hours in the day for work housework and Kiddo and sleeping way too little is not an option anymore because I need to heal myself and care for my energy levels...Triumph: Everyday something comes back into my head heart or habits that predates my drinking and also my violent decade-long marriage [a lot fell by the wayside to try and keep the peace] - things like recipes ways of cooking memories hobbies spiritual practices herbal remedies song lyrics [my own songs] and perspectives - all very nourishing and enriching both my own experience of life and also Kiddo's...General: my dishwasher for some reason lost its mind and unplugging it hasn't fixed it. It's less than a year old and came with the rental. Have chosen to see it as an invitation from the universe to enjoy the soothing nature of warm sudsy water and the satisfaction of honest human effort. This attempt at Zen may not last ;). 
**Struggle**: Work has been getting dicey again lately and I've had a really difficult few days. I've been eating my feelings and my sugar consumption is starting to really become an issue...**Triumph**: I've worked out twice a day every day since Saturday! I feel awesome and it's so nice to be sore again...**General**: Since I stopped drinking my love for coffee has increased exponentially. I love my coffee. It is my best friend. 
Struggle: Trying to get organized at work for an upcoming project. I feel overwhelmed by all the information that needs to somehow be pieced together so I let myself get sidetracked out of making much progress on it. ..Triumph: The initial excitement of working out has passed for me I still feel good after doing it but I have to make myself do it now. I'm calling it a triumph though because I do still do it even though I'd rather be sitting on the couch...General: I think February is trying to be all the seasons in one here in NY. We had freezing cold and snow rain mild sunny days and yesterday it was up to 70 but it will be into the 20's by tonight. Craziness.
**Struggle:** My sleep is off (maybe due to allergies? haven't figured it out yet) and I'm having a hard time waking up. I'm so groggy in the mornings lately! I just want to stay in bed. ..**Triumph:** My workouts have been going ok and I feel like I've been getting into a good schedule that accommodates work-life balance...**General:** Today is day 200 for me! Yay!!!..**Edit to add another general:** One of my neighbors is almost certainly an alcoholic and on the rare occasions I see him outside (usually putting out the recycling) he looks awful. I know I can't do anything for him. He doesn't seem to have much interest in socializing with anyone and the few times I've seen him and said hello he was very disengaged. I saw him (not looking to great) this morning and I'm sending him positive thoughts today.
**Struggle:** Exchanged strong words with the GF the other night that has me back to questioning our relationship. Working on recognizing that she's allowed to be fallible and how important it is to accept all of who she is. I romanticize this myth of the perfect partner who will be adventurous outdoorsy have their emotional shit together and make me feel like a million dollars. This may not be the right relationship for me in the end but I cannot just pick and choose the parts I want to accept...**Triumph:** I am not my emotions and every day I seem to have a greater acceptance of these crazy swings and choose not to act on them...**General:** My aunt has suddenly been diagnosed with terminal cancer. This is the first time someone so close to me is going to be leaving this Earth shortly. Working to just be present and open to whatever this experience will be while loving and supporting her.
Struggle: Haven't been able to visit my dad in his care home for two whole weeks due an infection problem there - but I'm going later today!    ..Triumph: Eldest daughter phoned me from uni for 2 hours this morning for no particular reason except to chat and youngest messaged to say she had passed her first uni assignment with a great mark ( as a mum their wins are my wins!)..General: I still can't stop eating biscuits especially ginger nuts!
S: I've been unemployed in a small town for months now and can't find work. I don't know what I want to do with my life..  .T: Working out and jogging has felt really good. I pushed through some strong urges pretty much every day so far.  .  .G: I didn't have a dream about drinking but I woke up and instantly thought about drinking tonight. Alcohol is stupid and my brain is stupid. It wasn't a real thought but it's still annoying.
Struggle: depression paired with the rainy weather is making the urges harder than usual to suppress through running and biking. ..Triumph: spent the weekend in LA and remained sober despite hanging out with old pals in a couple of bars. ..General: I really think I'm going to move to another state soon. don't know which one but it'd be a shame to turn 30 in TX after being here practically all my life.
S.In some sort of depression not even sure why.  I do often hate this time of year.  I have thought more about drinking than I have in months.  Not tempted just thoughts...T.Got nothing EXCEPT I am still sober.  300 days sober.  Which is something.  Longest period without alcohol maybe ever (I was known to swipe beer bottles off the table as a toddler and have a sip or two before someone frantically took it away)..General.This weekly post is probably my favorite thing on SD and that is saying something!..Also you're fucking right about February!
Struggle: no job..Triumph: completed an interview and have two scheduled for later this week...General: I have time off to enjoy this brief heat wave we are having to hike walk the dog and listen to the birds with the window open...Did I do this right? 
S:  Another exam on Thursday!  Ton of studying to do!  Ahh!..T:  I'm not drunk I'm not hungover so that's somewhat of an advantage.  And I will not drink after my exam pass or fail...G:  TS Eliot said that "April is the cruelest month."  I've always thought it was February.  One more week.  We can do this.
**Struggle:** I'm alone and don't want to be anymore. Booze isn't there to remove my feelings. ..**Triumph:** I haven't missed a day of crossfit since I started. Gawd damn I'm sore. Feelsgood.jpg..**General:** I'm starting to feel a lot more than I use to I'm thinking a lot more about my actions and others. Like a normal human does I suppose. I cringe at the thought of who I was the past couple months. ... Because true belonging only happens when we present our authentic imperfect selves to the world our sense of belonging can never be greater than our level of self-acceptance. 
Struggle: Yesterday I'd gotten hit with the hardest set of cravings ive had in weeks while I was cooking dinner. One of my favorite things was cooking while getting progressively drunker so that brought me back. Didn't end up drinking though...Truimph: a lot of the seeds I planted a few days ago have sprouted so im really excited for them....
**Struggle:** My wife's health is not good. Bringing back the anxiety and belief that I need a time out or a go to. Need to be OK for her...**Triumph:** My youngest has been playing guitar and singing in front of people. His self esteem and confidence are going thru the roof and I like to think stopping drinking helped. ..**General:** Went and saw a metal band play a show and took 3 kids. Sort of forget that I can do things. May even stop at McDonalds one day lol.
Struggle:  It's around that time when my hormones get out of whack and I'm anticipating a few days of real emotional shittiness which scares me as I usually use pot/booze to get through it. ..Triumph:  I am seeing a therapist for the first time in a long time today and really want to put some effort into it to change my life. ..General:  I've lost four pounds the weather is getting warmer and I have movie/dinner plans with a sober friend tonight so yay. 
**Struggle:**  I'm not staying in the present as much as I'd like.  I have always had the habit of over planning future events but now without booze to distract me it seems like I'm almost constantly 'living' in the future...**Triumph:**  I have some amazing camping/backpacking trips and cycling events planned for the Summer!  ..**General:** We need rain!
[removed]
Struggle: Having a number of personal and professional issues that are causing me stress/anguish. Having to make decisions have uncomfortable conversations that I fear will make people upset with me feeling inadequate/rejected. Ruminating/avoiding instead of dealing. Not feeling like I can trust myself or my feeling...Triumph: I hit 500 days recently! And the weather is fantastic unseasonably. I feel optimistic. Been exercising the last few days - weights yoga walking. I feel physically strong...General: I really need more sleep but I rarely want to go to sleep on time.
Struggle: I woke up drained after yet another terrible sleep. 17 days in and was hoping for some magical energy to appear ..Triumph: I ate breakfast AND lunch..General: it's February and above 0 Celsius. That's pretty sweet. 
oh mary - many hugs to you. ..struggle: losing weight was great and not it is hard. i am trying to stay on track because it is a true goal but boredom is the devil...triumph: more confident at work - also new apartment..general: be present. 
Struggle: Lately I've been thinking a lot about how fun it would be to have a "mocktail" and/or find the best non-alcoholic beers...Triumph: Remembering that my dad broke a long sober streak by dipping a toe in with non-alcoholic beers and how fast that became 'I can have just one it's fine' and how that time was his last time falling off the wagon before he died of alcoholic-related disease. That was the end of the N/A beer and "mocktails" inner monologue for me. 
**Triumph:** Back from a good soul-satisfying vacation...**Struggle:** My son and I are rubbing each other the wrong way. He's got my flash-point temper but seems to calm down faster than I do most times...**General:** Snow glorious snow and it feels like winter!
**Struggle:** after my stepmom passed away i've also been mourning my mom (she's still alive). My stepmom was whom I always considered my "mother". My mom was awful growing up and after my stepmom passed away I realized that the fantasy of my mom ever being that person whom I wanted to as a parent will never happen. It's strange mourning someone while they're still alive. ..**Triumph:** I've been working on my sleeping night routine and I'm back to taking care of myself (slowly but surely). I'm taking vitamins and seen improvement in my mood...**General:** I want to work out! I've been so sluggish and struggling to recover from being hungover almost every day that I never have the energy to do it. I finally have energy to do more than walks with my dog.
Struggle: getting out of my room and going to college today was a nearly impossible task...Triumph: I went saw some friends (although one of them was frosty with me because of my drunken behaviour last week still don't know what to do about that). This time last week I was making a fool out of myself and knowing I'll wake up tomorrow without a hangover and crippling guilt makes me happy...Hope you are all well! 
Struggle: First vacation since I stopped drinking. ..Triumph: Went to the bar after basketball with friends and wasn't tempted to drink...General:Will be heading up to visit a friend before he moves to Germany. "Fridge" full of beer - and fully expected lots of peer pressure
Struggle: Just sent a badge reset message after 4 days of drinking. ..Triumph: I poured out all of the booze left in my house..General: I had a long weekend and ended up drinking every night. In my head it was to get rid of the booze I had left; one last hurrah. Monday night I finished it and then remembered I had home-brewed cider in a closet so I started drinking that too. I called into work for half a day on Tuesday morning. When I finally got up to go in I poured out the rest of the cider... maybe 8 liters or so. There is no more booze in my house and I hope it stays that way this time.
**Struggle:** Realizing I'm not sure I can really trust my boyfriend and despite his own goals toward recovery and words of support for my own sometimes I kinda feel he's only concerned with my health and happiness if it's directly related to him or if he feels he can take credit for it in some way. Also he called me while I was running today and super jazzed on endorphins I hadn't felt in ages then complained for the next 40 minutes before suggesting an activity this weekend he knew full well would put my sobriety at risk. When I explained my concerns he countered with "Well I could just not drink either" - as if that'd be my only hurdle in a crowd of inebriated strangers in an unfamiliar setting from which I'd be unable to easily escape. I know his intentions are good but.. argh. ..**Triumph:** Aforementioned run - first in years woot woot. Also just made a fabulous cup of chamomile tea with coconut milk. ..**General:** I started a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy workbook and am feeling hopeful about it. Next step finding a therapist!
