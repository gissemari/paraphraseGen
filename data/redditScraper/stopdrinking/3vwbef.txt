Hello all. I have been hovering around this subreddit for over a year. I am struggling with the strength to overcome day 1. I have done it before but lately it feels impossible. Everyday I wake up and tell myself that I just wont drink this one day and that I'll take each day 1 at a time. But after a couple hours of being awake all I can think about is my next drink.. I am looking for advice on overcoming day 1. I know I can beat this struggle but the first day feels like an eternity without a drink. I am also afraid of withdrawal symptoms. I have no idea what it feels like to go to sleep sober.

I can totally relate to you as if I had written this post myself...Going through the withdrawals is a little journey worth going through. For me it lasted a few weeks...The first 2 weeks I slept no longer than 4 hours per night sometimes just 2. 3rd week was a bit better...But try not going so far. Just think about today. It worked for me -it still does. I am not drinking *today*. And I am not sleeping today and I am getting bored today. Let see if that kills me. Of course it didn't killed me. I just didn't sleep and got really bored at the beginning...Eventually sleep will happen without any pills or tea or anything (for me). The body just needed a few (long) weeks to adapt. ..Drinking was not fixing my life and not drinking either. But oh! I am happier now...Like I read somewhere in this sub I considered and still do every night I do not drink as a win; so I feel like a winner every night I don't drink...Again just not today. ..Key: not having any alcohol at home not hanging out with drinking friends (my friends are not happy about that) not going to bars or parties...Additionally: find people who go in nature (facebook/meetup groups help) and take walks. Go to the movies and anything not alcohol related...It sounds boring and it is. But soon enough life do changes for the better....Best of luck!
Yo how are you going today? ..Youve done it before you can do it again!.. For myself I have a huge pile of bricks out the front from a reno so whenever i feel like drinking i go clean a few bricks. Just one at a time then start chipping away at the next one haha its pretty boring but somehow the monotony and concentration is kind of relaxing and there is a feeling of satisfaction as they stack up. ..Good luck today mate and if not today just have a crack again tomorrow. ..You got this!
