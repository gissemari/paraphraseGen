Hi everyone!..There was a post earlier today about the term  dry-drunk  that got me thinking. It's not a term that I've used frequently but rightly or wrongly (probably wrongly I probably should've used my boundaries and reduced my contact with them instead but that is the reality of my actions) I've used it with regards to someone in my life...It's a term that I have also used to describe myself during my last period of sobriety. I got about three or four months of quality sober time in and then it gradually tailed off and then I became a dry drunk. And I was a *dry*-ass drunk...I wasn't drinking but drinking hadn't really been my problem. Drinking was my *solution* to my problems. I drank because I didn't know how to deal with myself or with my life or how to be in the world in general. When I quit drinking I was still the same person and I still had the same life and I still lived in the same world that I didn't really know how to deal with and I didn't quite feel like I belonged in. ..Part of why I kept drinking regularly and heavily enough that I developed a physical addiction to alcohol is that drinking felt better than sobriety. Drinking made living life easier and more possible. Even when I wasn't drinking it helped. Drinking functioned as a release valve for me. All of the feelings and frustrations that I didn't know how to deal with the angst fear anxiety and pain would just build and build inside of me like steam. I did have other outlets (sorta) but *nothing* worked like drinking did. ..I got an almost immediate sense of relief from drinking that actually got stronger the worse my drinking got. As my alcoholism progressed I felt *more* relief from taking that first drink and not just because I felt increasingly worse facing life without anything in my system. It was a short-lived feeling that quickly turned into drunken sludge but there was a tremendous payoff for me in it it felt *sooo* good to take that first drink. That's why I kept doing it. I may have been killing myself but I was getting something out of it. I'm not dumb...I also felt a genuine sense of catharsis a lot of times when I woke up with a hangover. Not always I had a lot more shitty hangovers and it really only came from getting *properly* drunk not maintenance drunk. But I do remember waking up from nights of getting drunk and feeling a sense of release and relief like somehow I had worked through something or let something go while I was drunk. It was a false promise and it didn't last but that was also something that alcohol did for me...And so when I got sober I lost all of that. I worked on my sobriety at first but as I got established in sobriety all of that seemed less important. I wasn't tempted to drink and I was thoroughly convinced that I *couldn't* drink so it seemed like an unnecessary waste of time. I had more important things to be working on and doing. I had to get on with living my life. And I was ashamed of being an alcoholic and needing support...I was still living my life that I didn't know how to live. In the world that I still didn't know how to cope with. In my skin that I felt uncomfortable in. ..At about 18 months I drank again. I'd been  **B**uilding **U**p to a **D**rink  for a couple of months before then. I already knew the acronym BUD at that point but it didn't matter. I wasn't doing *anything* to deal with my underlying -ism so everything that I'd learned from the neck up about drinking was of no use to me. I'd hung around here quite a lot by that point I'd read books about alcoholism and recovery I'd been to a decent number of AA meetings. But I still had a problem and alcohol was still my only solution...The crazy thing is that intellectually I knew I couldn't drink. That's the power of addiction right there - it's not like I didn't know that it was gonna be a shitstorm when I drank again and it's not like I was kidding myself about being able to moderate successfully or drink normally or any of that. By that point I knew that I was an alcoholic and I knew what was gonna happen and I drank anyway. As bad as I knew that drinking was going to be for me I didn't have any better solution for what was going on inside. Talk about a rock and a hard place - drinking was going to kill me but life was too painful to keep living without it...I was treating my depression and seeing a good therapist at this point. I was getting regular exercise. From the outside my life looked fine. I was dying inside but for all intents and purposes I basically looked like someone who was functioning as a sober person. ..I was retreating into my -ism. I was isolating heavily and getting stuck in weird loops in my head. Life got more and more overwhelming. I was so disconnected from all of my emotions except anxiety and depression that I didn't even know I had an absolute tempest of things raging inside of me. But I was fine goddamnit. Everything was fine...Long story short I drank again. It was a solution that I knew would work for how I felt and what was going on inside of me. I knew what it was going to be like and I did it anyway. Because it seemed better than the alternative and I was so locked in all the crazy going on in my head that I had tunnel vision. I couldn't see any other way out. Either I would drink and basically sorta ended up dead and/or experiencing a lot of terrible consequences from it or I would have to keep living this unbearable life day after day. ..And I knew that the problem wasn't the specifics of my life. I mean I needed to end my marriage and I couldn't see that but that wasn't really my problem and it wouldn't have changed anything for me. I was equally unable to deal with a divorce or dating or being alone. The problem was me. The problem was my -ism...I managed to throw the brakes on my drinking after a shortish miserable spree for which I am eternally grateful but really what kept me from going down the rabbit hole was that I started fixating on getting my medical marijuana card so I could go down *that* rabbit hole instead. Which I did. I deluded myself a lot more about that and I avoided dealing with my problems and my underlying -ism for another year and a half while I created some different problems and messes with my substitute addiction...So that's what being  dry  means to me. It means that I don't have any more of a solution to the problem of how to deal with my life in the world as it is in my own skin than I did when I was drinking I just took away the only solution that I actually had. So I got crazier and more stuck in my head and more wound up and all the emotions and stress and overwhelm just kept building and building up inside of me until it started coming out in weird and shitty ways and then drinking seemed like a viable option again...I could see no solutions. I got rigid and defensive and I stopped looking outside of myself for help or insight or support. I was  fine.  I slipped back into that protective mode that I had when I was drinking where I stopped acknowledging that I had problems or I needed help and where I stopped seeing that help was even available to me. I'd long since stopped feeling connected to people. I mentally and emotionally went back to the place where I'd been before where drinking made sense...This time around in sobriety things are completely different. My recovery isn't perfect. I'm not 100% happy 100% of the time. I still slip into old patterns of thinking and behavior that are probably less than healthy and productive but that's okay. I'm making progress. And I'm already *waaay* better than I have ever been. And I know today that I don't need to be perfect I just need to do my best. I've found a lot of connection with others gratitude for what I have and actual contentment in sobriety. I enjoy my life and I enjoy who I am even when things suck and I wanna change a bunch of things about myself and the world around me. ..This is gonna have to be a cliffhanger it's already hella long and I have to go to bed. I just didn't want to end on the  drinking sucked but being sober was worse  note because I have found that I can live in my own skin and live life and deal with it and I don't feel like I'm building up to anything. From the outside my life looks harder and worse than it did when I was dry the last time that I got sober but it's a stone cold fact that I am now happier and I find life easier to live than I ever have. So recovery is possible. I am glad that I kept trying and I didn't let my relapses hold me back...Keep on keeping on sobernauts. There are people who have gone ahead of us it is possible to find the way out...Ginger_Sprout Out

Well I hope that was as cathartic for you as it was for me. Thank you. IWNDWYT!
Thanks Ginger\_Sprout that was a great read and is quite similar to where I am with things although I'm stuck in this seemingly unending cycle of short periods of drinking followed by a short stint of sobriety followed by a short period of drinking etc repeat ad infinitum.  .You say that "This time around in sobriety things are completely different." Can I ask what you are doing differently this time or why things are different? You don't specify so is it just that things are different for you now because things are different?  .I feel that as time goes on and I get more time sober under my belt I am starting to feel better prepared to tackle the reasons why I drink but I just can't seem to break out of this cycle.  .It would be great if you could answer but if not that's cool. I hope these sorts of questions are allowed mods - please don't shout at me I'm new here!
I've thought about the term "dry drunk" off and on for a while. My first time here I'd read the posts and I could easily relate to doing fucked up things drunk but drinking because I was self-medicating my problems??? No way I drank because I was happy. I drank because I loved life. I just loved life a little too much and became a drunk. Then I drank again......The reality is I may have started drinking because it was fun but I kept drinking to not deal with life's issues. It was 100% easier to have a few drinks than to engage in a much needed relationship discussion with my wife and deal with the relationship issues as well has her insecurity issues which always turn back to how terrible a person I am. When I heard Blah-Blah-Blah it was 100% easier to escape into a bottle than to parse the underlying reasons my wife was attacking me with words. ..I heard once that you go through the 12 steps of AA to discover (SPOILER ALERT) it's you! I guess that's what "dry drunk" means to me. It means I haven't accepted that the root cause of my drinking is me...I'm working on that. I'm working really hard on that.
I would like to figure out how to be happy without self medicating. It doesnt have to be alcohol for me but alcohol is very effective. And ive went a year completely sober and my feeling never improved
What changed??
Good for you for connecting your dots. Your story sounds a lot like mine. Drinking was fun until it wasn't. When the bad started to outweigh the good when my therapist and some honest friends started asking..."do you think you have a problem?" Of course I still didn't think I did. ..What keeps me sober is handling a lot of the discomfort trauma internal views of the type of person I was and while I couldn't align with who I wanted to be. Why I wasn't perfect lol..NOW omg -- it's such a relief to acknowledge how imperfect I am. My best friend gets annoyed when I call myself imperfect like it's a bad thing. I think it's the most awesome thing to be because it means I'm a work in progress. I'm working towards something and that's okay. I'm human! What a relief you know? I'm not ashamed anymore. Do I not have shitty days? Yes! I have a high stress job my personal life went through a rough couple of weeks but I remained sober. I remained fucking present. I deserve to feel good in my skin and that isn't always the greatest feeling but I always say my worst days sober are HEAPS better than my best days drinking. I will never forget that. IWNDWYT
Good morning! Some things to remember as you're doing this work is that you're now able to manage all challenges and curveballs life throws at you without drinking or building up for a drink. You can do anything. ..It's tempting to remember how much  easier  life was when you could drink however you can do anything to face the underlying -isms without alcohol because of your strength peace and self-awareness. ..Also your sobriety brings this level of insight and self awareness. I loved thinking that drinking made me smarter about myself others and the world around me but that wasn't true. All my best most difficult work (the Oprah A-HA moments) happened sober. If I had any while drinking I forgot them by the next morning. ..Your writing and connecting the dots is a gift..As you share your journey everyone relates to pieces and aspects evaluates and questions ourselves. Your work is deeply meaningful to our community. Thank you
