Today it has been one year since my last drink.  It's crazy to think about...One year ago today I was sitting at 249 pounds and drowning in stress and self-pity.  I drank to deal with everything around me.  ..As I began to get used to sober living I realized if I could stop drinking maybe I could try to lose weight for real this time.  In the past year I have lost 90 pounds and I feel like a completely new person...For me living sober was not about missing the booze.  It was about realizing all of the things I was missing before.  This experience has reminded me of my strength.  Every day I give thanks for my new outlook on life and on myself...I have to thank this community and r/loseit for your everlasting support.  I never joined any sort of sober community but this one but I lurked with a vengance.  Thank you to all who share day in and day out about your triumphs and struggles.  It helps everyone of us.
