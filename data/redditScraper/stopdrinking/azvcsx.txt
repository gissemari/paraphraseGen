Tomorrow would be 10 weeks but yesterday was one of the hardest days of sobriety I've faced for weeks. Maybe it was the stress from work the new 6 month old puppy we got on Saturday the time change or maybe it was everything all rolled up together but I finally decided to give in and have a couple of my wife's beers.  I fought it mentally for a moment. Telling myself I would not stop if I did and would eventually ruin everything I have accomplished with diligent dieting and excercise. Then my wife went to bed and I prepared to go downstairs and open up my first beer. However as I neared the door I remembered the leftover half cup of cheese dip in the fridge and decided if I was going to cheat on my diet I would do it that way instead. ..I don't really think of yesterday as a win over alcohol but as a near failure to myself. However I am glad to admit that I did not drink with you yesterday and I will not drink with you today.

Yah know...I would look at going for the dip as just a pressure release valve.  So you cheated on your diet...you woke up sober and with a clear head.  I would say "THAT'S A WIN!"  I would try and be gentle with myself in these situations.  A little cheese dip isn't going to ruin your life...opening that can of alcohol...very well could.  I'm proud of you...Keep it up...I will not drink with you today.
Nice choice   those choices get easier better choices lead to better choices this is a great example of that.  I won't be drinking with you
That sounds like an amazing win!!! Thank goodness for cheese dip.   IWNDWYT.
Id be alot more pleased with myself!
