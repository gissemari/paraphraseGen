First time posting here. 35M. Can go months without an urge but once I cave it's back to being a weekend warrior. 6-pack gone in two hours and walking back to the store for a couple tall boys. I hate the taste I hate the hangover yet I rinse and repeat. ..I have not struggled so far this time but I know the urge will come because my mind will trick me into thinking I can handle one. I can't. And that's ok. No reason to beat myself up about it. I will continue to take it one day at a time. I got this. I can live free from alcohol. It does nothing for me but hurt my body hurt my relationships and waste my time. ..Thank you for everyone that shares. In the past your stories have given me another day. When you post you have no idea how many people you may keep strong for that day. Thank you. ..I Will Not Drink With You Today!!!
