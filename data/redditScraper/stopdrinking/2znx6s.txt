Hey everyone! I'm posting a little on the late side again. I had a screwy night of sleep last night which threw off my whole day. I woke up around 3am and couldn't get back to sleep. That used to happen when I was drinking of course so at first it felt familiar. But then I woke up enough to realize that I'm sober and that shouldn't be happening. It freaked me out a little. I eventually realized that our thermostat/radiators need to be adjusted and the room was too warm and eventually I got back to sleep...Anyway yesterday was day 37 out of the [90 days of goals I set myself to kick-start my recovery.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2ykia8/day_2890_report/cpamtjj) The four goals I am focusing on are:..1. Going to therapy and doing the exercises my therapist gives me...2. Answering my phone and using it to connect with people in my support network...3. Checking in here daily...4. Going to a support group meeting daily. I've actually gotten pretty involved in AA (which I did not predict would happen when I started doing this!) and have started working on the steps with a sponsor. ..I'm doing all of this because in the past when I tried to quit drinking what I did was not enough to keep me from relapsing. I needed to get sober and I need to stay sober so I had to do more than I have in the past. ..So far this little program has been working out pretty well for me. I'm not tempted to drink. I don't miss it and I don't desire it. I'm basically happy with scattered grumpiness and irritability which I guess is par for the course with early sobriety...I feel like I pretty much met all of my goals yesterday. Aside from the therapy goals because I am failing miserably at cutting back on my caffeine intake and getting into regular sleep habits...I went to a beginner's step study meeting in the afternoon. It was - surprise! - a 12&12 meeting. But the step we read/talked about was 6 which I haven't discussed (or thought about) much. It was interesting enough. Actually I was in a much better mood when I left the meeting than I was when I got there and in some ways I think that was the most productive thing I did all day...I have been struggling with tiredness lack of motivation etc. but I'm trying to remember that I'm still fairly new in my sobriety. Last time I made it this far I got discouraged that I wasn't feeling better sooner. I realize now that it takes a while to mentally and physically recover from years of drinking so I'm not getting too worked up about it. Things will continue to change and improve as long as I stay sober...Anyway I guess I should get to bed. Take care /SD!
