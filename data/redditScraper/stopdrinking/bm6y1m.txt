Had a great few days going and I got bored.  I had absolutely no good plan to avoid the Witching Hour last night.  So the inevitable happened.  It totally snuck up on me.  I had no plan to fight the urges or the cravings and for me that's basically like walking on to a firing range.       ...Now today I'm struggling with all the absolute negativity that my brain is throwing at me knowing that the effects are all due to alcohol and the stories my brain is telling me about how I'm worthless and useless are all fake - BUT damn it feels real.  Lowest of the low.  Of course called off work this morning with a bullshit excuse and working from home for the rest of the day.  Alone feeling wretched and lost.  Wow drinking...what a total life sucking useless activity.

&gt;the stories my brain is telling me about how I'm worthless and useless are all fake - BUT damn it feels real. Lowest of the low...OP - you are not worthless OR useless.  You hit a bump on the road.  You will only fail if you give up on trying...I found that meetings (online for me - I do not do AA) were a great help as well as finding people to hold me accountable...You can do this!  IWNDWYT.
I did the same thing last night! Had been sober 10 days when my husband and I decided to go out and celebrate Nurses Day. I had only two glasses of wine with dinner but no sleep and I feel like shit today at work.  Forgive yourself and move on!
Lol I used to be able to drink 2 sick packs and a couple of shots! At 56 my tolerance is way down....
