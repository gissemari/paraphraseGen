I posted on Sunday that IWNDWYTomorrow stating that I planned to put the bottle down Monday. Well I did it. For me I had to set a date. Had to mentally prepare myself for my last rendezvous with my best buddy..I was terrified but as I drank my last evening bottle of wine I read the first couple of chapters of  The Naked Mind'. I didn't want to put the book down. It's familiar as I've read  The30 day Sobriety Solution'.  Both books seem to have a similar tone but TNM focuses more on the neurological aspects of why people  think  they are dependent on alcohol. I was successful for my 30 days while reading the  challenge  but started drinking day 31. It was like a reward. I've been told that will power isn't shit. Anyone can stop something for any given period of time but to truly give something up is on a whole  nother level. I'm hopeful that with self determination the tools this book teaches me and the support from y'all  that I will be able to put down the booze for good. I'm already terrified that I'll relapse in late May on a girls weekend out. Celebrating birthdays and a friend moving. We always all get smashed together. I'm usually the most intoxicated. I'm already bargaining with myself that I can have a  cheat  weekend. Justifying my actions before I have 48 hours under my belt. I am terrified that the me without alcohol will be undesirable. I'd rather continue to drink pretending nothing is wrong rather than get healthy and possibly lose some friends. Not really but really..Today is day one. Well actually the start of day two. That is a huge accomplishment.
