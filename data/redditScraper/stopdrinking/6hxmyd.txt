I've had three goes at not drinking all of them being last year. My second attempt at quitting drinking lasted four days shy of five months so this is by far the longest I've gone without drinking & I'm in a great state of mind. I really learned from both of my relapses especially the last.. It's that first drink that reels you back in & before you know it you're drinking everyday again & are now lost in a maze alone & with no end in sight. THAT'S what keeps me from drinking. THAT'S what scares me to no end.. Being TRAPPED in that state of reliance on alcohol to avoid dealing with my emotions. That's what's so terrifying about alcoholism. It took being caught lying about my drinking to my family in order to stop again. If I were to start drinking again who knows what it would take in order to quit again. Plus all of my friends & family know I'm an alcoholic so if I were to go back to drinking I'd have to resort to hiding & lying again which I don't ever want to do again. Lying & keeping secrets destroys relationships & I don't want to be that person that alcohol makes me. Thanks for reading everyone. I've learned so much from everyone's stories here...Edit: Sorry for the wall of text >.<
