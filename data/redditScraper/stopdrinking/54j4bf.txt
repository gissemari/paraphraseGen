had a loooong crappy day; my worst day of the week tends to be Sunday. i'm working with a counselor/therapist and a lot of shit is coming up from my past that i have just never dealt with appropriately. physical abuse from my alcoholic dad (most of the time seemed to occur on Sundays) that just won't stay buried and seems to surface on this day. But thankfully i didn't pick up. i'm hoping that eventually things *will* get better. but at least i can bank on alcohol only making things worse. So i won't drink......what did i do instead? .had an awesome bad attitude.cried.took a nap.played Angry Birds.watched several hours of Netflix documentaries.checked in on this sub countless times.checked in on my teen-aged boys.talked to bf about my shit then watched some of the Lions/Packers game with him.drank my diet soda(s) and ate some burgers and sat on my butt...maybe a more responsible person would've done laundry cleaned the kitchen or tried to catch up on the huge pile of work papers that leers at me from across the room but then i'm not really all that responsible. i'm just an alcoholic trying to stay clean and this was the best i could do today......i'm almost 60 days in now and i don't want to i can't wreck a good thing going on with this sobriety stuff. ..tomorrow is the beginning of a new day and a new work week. i hope its good....at least i won't have to struggle with a massive hangover or worse a hospital stay. I'll be clear minded and ready for all the challenges that will bring...So a huge thanks to everyone here on SD you kept me from jumping off the ledge!

Good to see your focusing on the important stuff.  Sobriety first  laundry second. 
Yep definitely sobriety first and everything else second.  You got through the day sober and that's the most important thing.
