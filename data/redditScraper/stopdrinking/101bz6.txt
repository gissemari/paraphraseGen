So I grabbed a beer at a party on Friday and sipped it for a while before coming to my senses. Four months of sobriety gone and back to square one.

Err no. You have been sober for four months. That's fantastic! That's four whole months that you haven't been poisoning your body. Four months of finding different ways to live your life than to be drunk. Four months of waking up feeling pretty damn good no?..**Now** though you are at a real danger point. You have given the alcohol monster another gasp of life. He will be bending all his strength to make you give in *again*. In fact I'm pretty sure that's his voice I can hear in your post:  back to square one  indeed! What nonsense!..**Now** you must use every ounce of *your* strength every trick in your book to get back onto the wagon and cling on for dear life. Whatever it takes for you whether that's AA meetings reading Allen Carr or some other good literature or just hanging out here or in the irc. You can do it!
