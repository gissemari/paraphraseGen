When I used to be active in AA during the beginning of my recovery I'd always hear people talk about how grateful they were to be an alcoholic. I thought that was a nice thought but I was sure I'd never get there. I wanted to push my alcoholism away and never speak of it. I wanted to be the person who casually mentioned that they didn't drink. I didn't want to open up about my alcoholism or the struggles that went along with having an addict's brain. BUT 9 months later I can finally say that I am happy to be an alcoholic. There was so much about my life &amp; my past that I buried. In sobriety I've been able to unpack those things and it's made me a calmer better person. Without suffering from alcoholism I would have never taken an honest look at the things that I did in hopes of becoming different. Addressing my drinking problem has allowed me to address deeper problems and I am eternally grateful for that day I sucked it up and checked myself into rehab. Life is still a struggle. I still struggle with my demons but I don't have to drink them away anymore. I'm so happy to not have to numb myself any longer. ..To anyone reading this: I wish you a slow recovery. And I will not drink with you today.
