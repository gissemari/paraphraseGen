I'm not sure I have anything too profound to say.  A life without alcohol has become my new normal and I am very thankful for that.  I'm thankful for the support of my family and friends.  I'm incredibly thankful for this sub without it I may not have made it past the first months.  Whether you have one hour of sobriety or 30 years never forget that you are doing something incredible.  Something many of those who struggle never do.  I love you all here's to another great year.
