Oh I have had a bug yesterday I was so ill it was untrue. .But I knew it wouldnt last and today is a better already.  ..This is drinking its the worst thing in the world at the time but its just for the day tomorrow can always be better.  ..We will all be fine if we just take it one day at a time.  ..Anyone struggling and fancy a chat let me know.  ..Iwndwyt.
