Hi all. ..This might be long but I want to introduce myself. ..I'm 24 years old and I've been drinking daily for about 4 years now. It all started in college with easy access to booze and pot and a party culture that accepted and sometimes encouraged it. I always knew I had an addictive personality (the amount of tea I drank and WoW I played can testify to that) and I knew that my family had alcoholic tendencies (my dad and uncles can testify to that too). But I like most others probably thought that *I* of course wouldn't be an alcoholic. ..I was quite wrong. My alcohol intake steadily rose through college until my friends and family were getting worried about me. I sometimes had night terrors scaring all my roommates. I was kicked out of my first house after college for being a drunken mess and destroying things while stumbling around blacked out. I went to work hungover for years and after my first amazing job ended I was directionless. ..I lived off of savings and unemployment for a year after that drinking away the vast majority of it. I didn't apply for jobs I didn't better myself I didn't do anything but drink expensive beer and play video games. I ballooned 60 pounds from 180 to 240. Eventually a few months ago I ran out of money and moved in with my mother. ..I thought that being in another place with someone I love and who cares about me would put me in a better mindset. I thought that I would naturally just stop drinking so much. And I did sort of. I didn't get drunk every night but I did still get buzzed. But every once in a while a few times a month on my days off I just got absolutely hammered. Blackout loud and stealing her alcohol. ..Eventually she had enough. She confronted me and was absolutely livid - a mix I think of anger sadness and disappointment that I was repeating the mistakes of my father. (Who by the way is now doing quite well. It just took a divorce for him to realize his problem.) ..I've always toyed with quitting alcohol and I promised people around me that I would - only to relapse literally the next day. This time I feel different. I'm not promising other people anymore I'm not convincing them - I'm promising myself. It took me seeing how much I hurt and betrayed one of the people that I love most in the world to really understand in my heart rather than my mind what I was doing. .. I'm late on bills and working a part-time minimum wage job - way less than what I'm capable of. I've drank and pissed away the first half of my 20's. I don't want to do the same with the second half. ..I'm now on day 6 of not drinking. I feel great. The feeling of accomplishment I get when I go to bed is far more rewarding than dicking around on reddit drunk. ..I can't promise myself that I'll never drink in the future. The only thing that I can control is the present moment right now. And as long as I promise to never drink in the now then I'll never drink again in the future. Maybe one day I can do what my Dad has managed to do and be able to drink socially and not go overboard. But that day if it comes won't be for a while. ..I already feel smarter like I used to. People have already told me that I look better without being able to point out exactly why. I've lost 4-6 pounds already (depending on the scale lol). ..This Friday I'm going to a party to see friends that I haven't seen in months. There will be drinking there but I won't be partaking - I've already set up plans that will require me to drive after the party and throughout all the horrible things I did while drinking at least I can say that I've never driven drunk. ..I just applied for my badge and I hope to not drink with you all today. ..Thanks for reading. This sub has helped a lot and I'll be around. ..P.S. - will my hands ever stop shaking while I'm sober? It's slight but still annoying. I'm hoping that goes away in time. ..

Great to meet you 267! It's a pleasure to not drink together with you today. 
Yeeeeee buddy!..I'm 23 years old and this is my longest since i was 14. Man did i love to do cocaine and bang chicks. I've stopped all alcohol and drugs and man i have so much energy i bike 20 miles a day and still go to the gym. People have been saying how great i look and my skin is clear and smooth. ..The hardest part is going to social events and not drinking while still trying to play an active role in meeting people and having fun. But just like any muscle it has to be strengthen with repetition. We're lucky man not even 25 yet we got a great head start. Good luck
