Hi everyone..First poster here just found this subreddit today while pondering ideas of how I can make this attempt at sobriety successful. To preface I am 29 years old and have been struggling with alcohol abuse for about seven years now. About three years ago I was diagnosed with three mental illnesses (bipolar borderline and DID) and around that time my alcoholism began to control my life as therapy became more and more emotionally draining. Over the past year though I made made immense strides for not only my mental health but my physical health as well including putting an end to my constant abuse of alcohol. Although I have concluded the chapter in my life of spending every evening with two bottles of wine or a six pack I still struggle with binge drinking. Due to the fact that I no longer drink alone or daily I struggle so much with accepting that I still have problems with alcohol abuse. ..As mentioned the past year of my life has been revolutionary to the point that I am now in a healthy and stable relationship. With this though I am now seeing the damage my binge drinking is causing. Before I could avoid all thoughts of what happened the night before what I did what I said if I drove home etc. but now I have to answer to a person I love dearly Over the past four months of our dating I have woken up too many times the next day unaware of what happened the night before and having to explain behavior that is uncharacteristic of who I am when I am sober...Even though I know that every single apology I've given to my girlfriend since we've been dating have been for my drunk behavior I'm still telling myself "okay Alicia just set a limit two drink maximum" rather than committing to sobriety. ..This changes now and not because of her because of me. I am no longer going to allow myself to create my own problems to cause episodes of depression to be the reason I beat myself up or think less of myself I am going to stay sober and only offer my sober amazing and wonderful self to this world. I can do this...If you read this thank you I look forward to being a frequent member of this subreddit.
