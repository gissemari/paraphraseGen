Why is it the more I tell myself I am not gonna drink tonight the more I want to drink??? Ugggghhhhhhh............I don't want to drink but my brain does........This metal struggle is the absolute worst AND it's exhausting!!!

That's because if takes several weeks of  bearing with it' before the urge and obsession begins to be manageable.  I had to surround myself with other recovering drunks to get me through. IWNDWYT 
It's not you that wants to drink it's your addiction. In order to break the chains you gotta deny it what it wants: more alcohol. 
Hello Albysmom !..You have zeroed in on the dilemma at which is the heart of alcohol substance issues.....  and *possibly* all addictions in general...It's Mind versus Body...It is Cognition versus Behavior...It is Thinking versus Acting...I can't "solve" my drinking by thinking.  Cognition is not observable. I cannot show you my cognition.  Cognition does not comply with the laws of physics has no corporeal presence and is not subject to temporal constraints.  In essence my "thinking does not exist" except in my ephemeral "mind"...I solve my drinking problem with behaviors:  Action...Action verbs override my cognitive contortions.  ..Here's the truism:..*It doesn't matter what I* **think**; *It matters what I* **do**...The way to get my mind to go where I want it to is to take my body there.......   After taking my body there with enough frequency and consistency *My Mind will Follow*...So for me I stopped dealing with my brain because it won and I lost...I started acting with my body...  doing things that keep me sober and my mind changed after a short time...Action verbs were my solution:  "Go" to a counseling session; "Attend" a free recovery meeting; "Call" a sober support person; "Walk" away from the alcohol aisle; "Assist" another person stay sober"......    ..I abandoned the "Mental Struggle" and now I have a lot more energy!..Whadda ya think?
I'm the same way. 
From what I remember of various motivational talks that I have heard is that it takes 21-30 days to  imprint  a new habit. I tend to agree with that. After I had been going to AA meetings for about 30 days most of the cravings disappeared. ..Good luck. I hope you can grab the brass ring one of these times. IWNDWYT 
Have you read This Naked Mind by Annie Grace? She speaks about this exact thing in the book. ..Also the aim of the book is to undo the conditioning of the brain to want to drink. It's a really great read. Amazon has it available for download if you haven't read it already. :)
