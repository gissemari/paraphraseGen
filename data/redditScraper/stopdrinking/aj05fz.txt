There's a reason for this clickbait title. Hear me out here guys.    .    .The first year of recovery is tough I'm not gonna lie. After removing alcohol from our brain chemistry our emotions are raw and unrestrained. It's a roller coaster. As our brains reel from the removal of the depressant effects of alcohol anxiety and mood swings are abundant and it can be really really uncomfortable. Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome (PAWS) can strike at any time. [Anhedonia](https://www.healthline.com/health/depression/anhedonia) is also common in recovery...in fact I believe anhedonia is a common reason as to why a lot of folks relapse after even several months of sobriety.    ..I know this all sounds like doom and gloom but the good news is that for every day we continue not to drink our brains work hard to replenish the "feel-good" chemicals that alcohol had once replaced.    .    .**There are some things we can do to help our brains along in the recovery process.**    .    .I often tout [mindfulness meditation](https://www.thetadprinciple.com/free-meditation-guide-0101adj.html) and exercise here. They have both helped me lower my anxiety levels to nearly zero and boosted my mood. In my second year of sobriety I started focusing on dieting and losing weight. After losing about 40lbs by switching to a plant-based whole foods diet I was ready to start doing some strength training and get my body toned. I've always hated lifting weights so I was looking for something else to do. I am a member of the local YMCA and realized they had tons of classes to offer that I could take that were included as part of my membership. So one day last November I took the plunge and signed up for a "power" yoga class. It was hard. I sweated through my clothes and didn't really know what I was doing. After class I felt...different. I felt light full of energy and was in a great mood. I decided to go again. And again. And again. As the cold dark winter months set in by the end of December and beginning of January something very significant had happened. I was **happy**. Just plain happy. At first I wasn't really sure what was going on. I didn't trust it. I was certain this was just some kind of mood swing and it wasn't going to last. But it kept going. I was wondering exactly what it was that I had done to deserve this. After I thought about it I realized yoga was the one variable I had changed in my routine. Still skeptical I did some research.    .    .As it turns out research has found that [yoga can immediately increase your levels of GABA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17532734) and actually be an effective way to fight depression and anxiety. Because yoga IS mindfulness meditation [it has all kinds of benefits](https://www.goalcast.com/2017/06/20/healing-power-meditation-brain-health/) including reducing the size of the amygdala...the brain structure responsible for the "fight or flight" response.    .    .[Here's a great article](https://www.goalcast.com/2017/07/13/science-behind-why-yoga-makes-you-feel-amazing/) with lots of links to real research that shows the benefits of this practice.    .    .I know this all sounds kinda hippy-dippy but I cannot emphasize what a profound impact yoga has had on my overall sense of well-being. I feel happier and healthier than I ever have in my entire life. If you find yourself struggling in recovery I HIGHLY recommend giving it a shot! Thanks for reading!    .    .TL;DR - Besides quitting drinking yoga is an incredible antidepressant.    .    .IWNDWYT    .    .ps. Getting muscles is a great side-effect! My wife is really excited... ;)

Awesome!  
Wonderful post. Thanks for sharing. IWNDWYT  
Man.... I want to confess something. I know everyone says yoga is amazing but I am somehow stubbornly reluctant to do it. I think it's becauee i don't understand how it can possibly help. Thanks for the post. You made me at least imagine going to a yoga class  . 
Great post! IWNDWYT 
I love me some hot yoga always have and recommend to anyone that's open to trying something new.  I can only do hot yoga because it feels more relaxing and more cleansing while being difficult.
I've been doing yoga regularly since last January and I've seen a ton of benefits. Physically I feel stronger more flexible I have abs! I can also tell that my mood in general is better. I have more energy later in the day than I used to. Yoga + not drinking has certainly been a winning combo for me as well. Thank you for sharing!
I've been thinking of incorporating yoga into my routine and this may be what pushes me to finally do it thanks!
