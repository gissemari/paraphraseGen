What does moderation even mean? When does the line get crossed between moderation and failing?..What is the difference between us and people who have a normal relationship with drinking?..Struggling today but been clean for 2 days. ..IWNDWYT.

I am not saying this to be snarky I promise... But in my experience people who have a normal relationship with alcohol don't even have to think about moderating. They don't wonder what it is - they do it intuitively and naturally. They drink have "enough" and stop. Their "enough" comes BEFORE they black out pass out get behind the wheel of a car get belligerent etc. It usually comes before even getting truly drunk...At a certain point in my drinking I completely lost the ability to moderate and enjoy my drinking. The times I was able to moderate I was miserable. When I drank as much as I wanted it wasn't moderation. 
Moderation to me would be having a drink or two a few times per week without getting more than slightly buzzed. I was occasionally able to do this but only short term. I'd always go back to drinking excessively after a few weeks. 
I wish I had the answer but the only thing I've got is I will not drink with you today. 
When I was a normal drinker for about five years when I started it was entirely incidental and I didn't get drunk. It was pretty rare too but the main thing is that it was incidental; I never thought about it and didn't discern it as more fun than anything else. ..Once it became a way to feel particularly good that's the spirit of a problem to me. Raw life should and can feel particularly good; it just takes healing work usually. Once that line is crossed the rest just seems like negotiation with the problem along a spectrum of loss.
