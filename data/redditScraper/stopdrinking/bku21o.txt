My mother came home just wanting a fight (maybe her dinner was stressful and I didn't move a bag from the front of the hall and she saw some dishes by a table I was sitting at) she just felt like taking jabs at me and telling me I do nothing and I just eat all the time (I am not a big person  at all and she's always commenting on my weight no matter how many times we discuss it and how many times I tell her it makes me uncomfortable). I am also a recovered anorexic and luckily it does not make me want to take drastic actions or hurt my self it just shocks me every time ..I am home for a bit and am working through mental health and continuing to stay sober and never use it as a means to cope. And my mother and fam like to test me every step of the way bec apparently if people can't see your struggling as in nothing is broken they assume your just lazy and you feel like doin things at a slow pace or you choose to be less productive. ..My mom likes to belittle me and make me feel bad about my self and has all my life (not  on purpose  she says it's bec she cares and wants to see me do better by constantly telling me what I'm not doing and how I am always not doing anything) ..Well I told her to stop trying to fight with me that I in-fact was just drinking my digestive drink (something I need to drink every day or my system goes hay wire) and to stop taking her aggression out on me. She said I know I shouldn't and just walked away. ..So I came to reddit and I am just sitting on my bed I'm gonna finish my digestive drink and listen to some music. ..I know we can't choose our parents and I should be grateful for having parents who gave me life and such I guess I just wish I could have helped my self more in my life but I guess you live and learn.

Life's not over. Get going and keep moving. You will be at a different place before long. Choose health and healthy people. Build your life and make it one you love filled with people who love you. Don't forget; Love is a verb. We can tell who loves us by the actions they take. Regardless of the words they say.
You can feel how you feel it doesn't make you ungrateful. Everything was so hard in the beginning and my emotions were so intense and difficult to deal with but sobriety really did allow me to learn to handle them. It can feel like you aren't making progress when you really are! We can't learn to handle hard things if we don't experience them. Glad to not drink with you today :)
