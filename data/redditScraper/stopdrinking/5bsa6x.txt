I fear that today will be a difficult day. I feel like one month ago when I stopped drinking. I have a colleague who worked on something but his approach is not good and does not solve the actual problem. However he is also a little Sissie and can't handle critique very well. I am struggling with him for a long time and decided some time ago that my luck is not connected to his work and that it is best for me to shut up. Today this is difficult. On top my wife made a snappy comment this morning and one of my kids was in a super-bad mood as well. ...aaand I can't find today's check-in thread :(..OK venting is over. I will not drink today and treat myself with a nice super large hot chocolate instead. Thank you for reading!..EDIT: thanks a lot you beautiful crowd! Hot chocolate from Starbucks is indeed an awesome therapy for bad days!

I love hot chocolate from starbucks. Yummy. Some days I guess just have to say F it and go to bed early. Atleast that is what I have to do. I will not drink with u tonight 
Sorry for the crappy start to your day. Those little things can sure add up. ..Proud that you aren't caving and are honoring the 33 days you've got so far by NOT DRINKING!..You've got this and I won't drink with you.
Something to look forward to: Starbucks has BOGO drinks the 10-12th.    I hope your day gets better and the chocolate is delicious! 
I will not drink with you today. Hot chocolate sounds awesome .
Good job not having that first drink and instead treating yourself to a well-deserved hot chocolate!
