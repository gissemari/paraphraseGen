I've been doing really well lately with my consumption. I've been cutting back and moderating. This means my tolerance is going down  and I didn't really think about that last night when I opened a bottle of wine. I thought since I was doing so well I could drink a little extra... we all know where this goes. I got drunk. Blackout drunk while playing Fallout 4. ..I wake up in bed this morning and I don't remember how the night ended. I have washed hair thus I took another blackout shower. Those always scare me. What if I passed out and drown in the tub? I go about my day and around lunch I see there are tons of videos on my phone. I was blackout drunk and recorded myself. Talked to  myself honestly. Drunk me begged sober me to listen and take heed. The videos are raw personal and exactly what I need. Anytime I feel the need the pull the want I'll just re-watch the videos. They're so powerful. More powerful than I could have EVER anticipated...So quick comment if any of you are struggling or want to quit. Do exactly what I did and record yourself at your worst. Sober you wont want you go to back there. No one would. Stay sober safe and sane. ..Best .EJ

That's why moderation would not work for me I'd get to a point where I wouldn't care and seeing myself on a video would not change anything. Have you ever tried stopping cold turkey? It might give better results..
Holy cow. That is not where I thought this tale was going when I clicked it. That must've been arresting. I hope you build on it. : ) 
Good idea! Sometimes I would write things on a piece of paper when I was drunk so I wouldn't forget. Most of the times it was telling me not to drink.
