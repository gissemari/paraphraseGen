So I get seasonal depression pretty bad but where I live there are typically distracting things and people to do and even Netflix can take the edge off to where it's manageable for the most part. I mean I'd like to just get wasted alone and pass out-it's so easy and feels good at the time but it's not healthy and I do a pretty good job limiting myself in my town keeping busy and productive. ..The problem is I am currently working in the middle of nowhere in a very rainy cold place (it's technically summer but feels like winter too me!). When it's sunny and warm-so rarely I feel good and happily socialize or enjoy time doing outdoor solo stuff. Even just putting on a cute summer outfit and make-up and chilling with a book make me feel so much better. But it is hardly ever nice. I can't stand it-I'm going home in two weeks to the sun. I'm miserable honestly can't really stand my fellow workers-they're happy loud and social and I'm sure I come off as such a sad sack though I really keep to myself. I don't like being this person it's not me and I don't want to be around people like this. There is a bare minimum internet so Reddit and occasionally FB but that's it. There's no town really so nothing to go out and do either. There's also no therapy/doctors really available to help with counseling or meds. Drinking is by far the easiest most fun activity for me and I am struggling! All I want to do after work is pass out with alcohol and cigarettes-alone and buried under blankets. When I don't have work that's what I want to do all day. It's an outdoorsy job and I typically love outdoors except that it's freaking cold and rainy constantly-I can't remember the last time I saw the sun or was warm. Hanging out with my coworkers-the only other activity doesn't go well as I can't shake this glum attitude. I'm easily embarrassed and am just out of the social circle anyways as I can't bear to hangout that often and even then it's mostly sitting quietly and listening. I can't even cook-one of my favorite hobbies for even the coldest of days and thus endear myself to others with treats because being in the middle of nowhere food stuffs are unbelievably expensive!! I don't want to drink with my coworkers either because it's obvious how different-happy talkative flirty I get and I have a hard time stopping out here...I just have two weeks before I make it home to sun fishing swimming friends camping hiking Netflix-all my favorite stuff and just a healthier mindset overall. Plus access to doctors and therapists. Help I'm going crazy and this isn't healthy. What do I do with myself other than drink alone in my tent in the rain and cold?? I work and excercise but then it's just a waiting game of browsing Reddit and staving off the desire to go buy alcohol by more reading/Reddit until the next days work and workout. Repeat. Sometimes I'm successful sometimes not so much but the only time I feel any better is with the drinks. If the sun would just come out for a little bit or there was even like a sauna or hot tub this would be easier but I'm losing my mind!

Hey there! I got one of those lights for light therapy. It's like this: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B012CBOFZ0/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1..It helped me through the winter and lack of sun. Good luck to you!
