I'm on my third day after a relapse and I feel like i have been drugged! I feel slow and tired and like a little old lady...I also have zero patience with anything. ..I just wanted to post and thank this community because reading and chatting has helped me hugely already.

Yes ma'am detox hell week is always that... a hell week. I feel you though you will feel better soon. I do know those first few days I kept looking at the clock like "wtf its still TUESDAY!?!?!?!" haha. I hope you get to feeling better soon! Physically I am doing better emotionally though I am still a hot mess :P..[High Five](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg) on your return
