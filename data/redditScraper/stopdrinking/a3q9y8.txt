I'm having such a hard time accepting that I just can't drink like a normal person no matter what I try... even if I'm doing good with sticking to my  harm reduction  plans it's still not  normal  to have to place all of these restrictions around my drinking.. anybody else struggle with this?

I struggled with acceptance even though I admitted I was in trouble with alcohol. Like you I tried to control my drinking but wasn't able to do it. Finally I became addicted to alcohol. When that happens it is hell like trying to balance on the edge of a razor blade. ..What helped me accept my alcoholism was learning about the disease/disorder. Reading *Under the Influence* by Ketchum and Milam had a profound effect on me. I understood what was happening to my body and brain and faced the truth that I had a condition that would be life-long. I stopped arm-wrestling with alcohol and decided to get help...Happily alcoholism goes into remission when we stop drinking. So that's what I did. However I had no clue how to build a sober happy life on my own. With the help of a therapist psychiatrist treatment and AA I now have my best life. ..I wish the same for you. ..
I can't just drink one or two. I drink to get drunk and if I start drinking one evening I will then drink every evening for weeks sometimes months...It's why I kicked it into touch. I can't drink. Sometimes I miss it. But I miss the idea of being drunk and having beer to look forward to. I don't actually miss the event itself.
