Sidebar says: no surveys. ..Edit: The section from the sidebar says..No surveys...This is a support group. People do not like to be poked at and prodded while they're in their support group. Links to surveys will be removed. If you're looking for information about the community check out the results of our latest official (and quite comprehensive) survey. Generally speaking the results may not be republished without permission. See the "legal" section for more information...
