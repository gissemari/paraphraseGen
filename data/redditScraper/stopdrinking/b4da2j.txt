I did relapse once in mid February but recently had my first string of good days. But this week I'm absolutely getting hammered by bad days. I've been using here and r/dryalcholics as a venting place and I've been so appreciative..This has been all new and the bad days so scary getting back to a sober way of thinking 24/7 has been a huge more adjustment than I thought. I know it's the PAWS symptoms kicking my ass but I had to learn all this while being surprised by what the hell was going on (I guess I was in bigger denial than I ever could've thought). .But the good days are worth everything and I know the only way to get there I just have to keep through. Thanks for the vent as IWNDWYT
