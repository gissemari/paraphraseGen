Lately I've been struggling with excessively drinking alone. I'm setting a new goal for myself of only drinking socially with other people in a party setting. I'm in college and can't afford to drink on school nights anymore. Is this a good idea?

If you are anything like me it would be short lived.   When I take that first drink I'm suddenly able to rationalize anything to get more. I am certainly not a shining example of AA  but reading the first 2 pages of chapter 3 ("More About Alcoholism") in the BB really helped me move forward.
Not to scare you but generally drinking alone is sign of progression in your drinking addiction. Any decision to cut back on alcohol is good. If your goal is to stop drinking then consider quitting altogether rather than cutting back.
For *me* there's no way I could just drink socially...Good on you for awareness and reaching out!..Not sure if you would be interested in the 30-day challenge where we don't drink for 30 days and then re-evaluate our decision...Of course we always keep in mind that quitting cold turkey and suffering from alcohol withdrawal could be dangerous so please see your doctor if you can :)..
Sure.  You could try having 2 drinks and then stop...Tried that?
I didn't drink to be social. I drank because I was addicted to alcohol.
Are you doing it because you can't afford or because you want to get your drinking under control?
