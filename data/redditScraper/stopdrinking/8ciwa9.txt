Everyone I know who struggles with alcoholism is also depressed. I get confused when people talk about how mental illness and addiction OFTEN coexist as opposed to practically always. .Is there anyone here who didn't struggle with mental illness during their active using days who can clarify this? (whether depression or anxiety...) .Edit: I also realize there are grades of addictions just like there are with mental illness

Well I mean the reason I chose to be a teetotaler is because I have a slightly addictive personality. I'm autistic and have ADHD. I wouldn't be surprised if I ever found out I have a couple other comorbids. Maybe a bit of social anxiety sprinkled in.
It seems to be a correlation in gradations as you say.  
I never thought of myself as having mental illness problems  Unless introvert counts . I just drank to much cause I liked the serenity it provided and buzz I guess .  
I'm really not understanding your question. What are you trying to figure out?
Yeah I agree.  Like 98% correlation.  Why would anyone suffer relentless hangovers if they weren't trying to escape some bad feeling to begin with?..The shitty thing is that alcohol helps with depression/anxiety in the very short term but in the long term fuels and exacerbates it.  It's a trap.
A trap Indeed.
