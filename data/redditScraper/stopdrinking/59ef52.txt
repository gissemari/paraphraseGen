Alright so I've been lurking the last few weeks and I'm glad to see so many people making positive changes in their lives. I'm 27 and the struggle that I have with drinking is stopping. I can't think of a time where I've ever had one beer or drink or anything like that. When I start drinking it typically becomes and all day event until I go to sleep. A few years ago I was really bad off and would black out and drank almost every day. I don't have episodes like that very often at all. I'll get mad occasionally but that was because I was mad before I started drinking and being drunk didn't help. But lately I've been considering quiting because of so many wasted days feeling like shit spending way to much money and have really noticed most of my thoughts that I associate with fun involve drinking. And the thing that really kind of scares me is thinking about quiting I try talking myself out of it because of upcoming events that I've committed to that involve drinking. To me that's where I noticed a big problem. I've quit for about 90 days before with no intention of quiting for good but quiting for good is something that I can't bring myself to commit to. Well before I delete this I'll hit post hope I didn't break any rules.haha

Quit one day at a time.                                 .If there is any history of alcohol abuse in your family it puts you at risk for alcoholism. I don't know if this applies.
Welcome!
