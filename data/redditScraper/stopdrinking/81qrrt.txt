I'm so exhausted from the past 2 months of dealing with all the emotional issues I was masking with alcohol and my impending divorce is weighing very heavy on my heart. The sneaky thoughts are starting to bombard me but I know posting this and setting my intentions clearly will help. So here it goes no matter what I will not drink with you today
