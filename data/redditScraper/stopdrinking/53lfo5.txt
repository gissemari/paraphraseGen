Been struggling with sobriety off and on for the past couple of years. Managed to stay sober for almost two months at the beginning of the year which turned into sporadic drinking which turned into 3-5 glasses of wine a night. Sometimes I managed to stay sober on the weekends. Sometimes I'd drink every day for two weeks. I could see the effects on my health and mood...I've got a little over 48 hours sober this time. However it's the first Monday I've been clean in months. I walk home from work and pass all of the bars on the way home (there are at least 7). Slowly but surely I became embarrassed by my behavior at each bar because I'd had too much once or twice. No fights maybe tears or drunk texts/calls to an ex. Always spending too much. By the end of Monday I couldn't walk past those bars without going in...But I walked by today and did not go in to any bar. I went to the grocery store.Reddit helped. So did the book Naked Mind. It feels good to clean make dinner and have a clear head. I am very grateful for the chance again to get my life back on track...

Congrats. I won't drink with you today. 
Good job.  Mondays were always big drinking days for me.  Weekends are for amateurs.   And I've worked in food and retail for 20 years so I usually work on the weekends. .Now I get smoothies on Monday.  I balk at the price until I remember that I'd drop $25 on alcohol for personal consumption. ..  on a Monday. 
That's awesome great job!
Well done!  I'm starting to get angry with those places that make money off people who are addicted to the stuff.  Enough exposure to alcohol and we're hooked.  Good on you for saving that money too!
Congrats l. I will not drink with you today
It begins with the first Monday and you did it! On to conquer many more :)
