After a particularly bad black out yesterday (ie face planting in front of literally 100s of people and not even remembering it) I decided enough is enough. I'm officially back on day 1 but I made the meeting met some people going through the same struggle as me and feel an odd sense of comfort in knowing that I'm not alone. I literally got tingles accepting that white chip like this is the start of a new chapter in my life. I've gone a day or two without drinking before hell even made it a whole week a while back but I never truly "quit" more just managed to abstain for a while... Well as we all know there is no such thing as moderation for people like us. It just doesn't work. It especially won't work when the intent is to get plastered and run away.....So for now while I'm gaining the strength I now have contact information and support for my continued sobriety...I'm nervous for this new beginning and am now set with the task of learning much better coping skills to deal with my problems but I'm hopeful and am grateful for the opportunity to do better tomorrow...IWNDWYT. &lt;3

Excellent work!..I wish I had started calling the phone numbers that were given to me earlier... I was so afraid of bothering someone and just didn't know how to ask for help... folks genuinely want to help and hear from you if someone doesn't answer move right on to the next number. They've all been right where you are...When's your next meeting?
We stop drinking for the same reason we start. To feel better! I know the opinions on AA are here and there but it helped me tons. Like you said knowing you're not in it alone. Just remember look for the similarities not the differences
