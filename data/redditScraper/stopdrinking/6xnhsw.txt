While searching for online 'support groups' etc. I stumbled upon this. I am new to Reddit. At 29 I've been drinking for about 10 years. I previously sought treatment and I've had some success with recovery in the past but have been struggling again the last few months. I don't drink every day but when I do drink it's in excess and it is absolutely a problem. I just finished two weeks of being sober but slipped up again last evening which is really upsetting. I am feeling positive and hopeful today but also feeling bad about last night. I am ready to stay sober but I am anxious about whether or not I can do it especially since I've had many 'Day 1's.

Welcome Shaun!  At this [link is a post called the Baby Steps which lays out how I stopped drinking and got sober.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Good luck to you.
