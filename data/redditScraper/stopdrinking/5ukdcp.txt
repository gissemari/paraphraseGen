I have not relapsed but from previous drinking experiences I'd imagine that if I were to relapse I would feel nothing before that first drink. I would shut it off and go on auto-pilot. That damn auto-pilot is what scares the shit out of me and it's why I chose not to drink today. 
When I had about 2 yrs. of sobriety (back in the day) that first drink filled me with fear- before I ever put my lips to the glass I was terrified...
