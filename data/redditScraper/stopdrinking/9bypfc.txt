I'm 32 now I've been an alcoholic for about 13 years now.  I wouldn't say I've had more than 6 months straight sobriety in that amount of time.  Usually no more than a week or two. ..Even with all the trouble it has caused me I struggle to picture life without it. I struggle even more with believing that the bottle is bigger than me although the evidence is right there...I've made my life really small at this point. Most of my friends have moved on moved away and progressed with their lives. ..I've struggled with depression even before I found alcohol and now it's my number one comfort. I love the way it makes me feel but the consequences to my life and to my health are becoming unbearable...I'm on medication now and I think it's really helping now that it's had a chance to get into my system and I've been sober for 4 days now. But it's not enough in and of itself. If I don't get busy living I'm going to be right here next year and the year after that if I'm not dead...I'm always trying to do it alone and it just doesn't work. I was thinking about going to AA tonight but the fact is I can't stand meetings. Maybe it's just my area but I've never found a fit. When I go to the larger meetings most of the time nobody even says hi at the door. Besides that I find they trigger me more than anything...I heard about this sub and I thought I would check it out. I need some sort of community...Thanks for reading :)

Welcome!..There's lots of good people here and lots to learn. I haven't done AA even though I have a lot of regard for some people for whom it has made the difference. Mostly it was just coming here every day. After a year of not drinking I heard about Refuge Recover which is pretty chill and I have learned a ton...Anyway glad to have you here!

 Life comes down to a simple choice: You're either busy living or busy dying. ..We are all serving a life sentence but some are making the best of it and some the worst of it. Props for your sober time and of meetings are not for you then SD is a pretty good alternative. Setting goals beyond stopping drinking were pretty important for me. It's the difference between being a dry drunk and a true sobernaut for me.
This sub is helping me a lot this time. Knew about it and read posts here during prior quit attempts...This time I am checking in and posting and it is really really helpful. I am antisocial so I get not wanting to go to the AA meetings. Highly encourage you to check in here and start posting!..IWNDWYT
This sub has helped me a lot. I read the books This Naked Mind and Alcohol Explained and that helped too. I've never been to AA. Maybe some day. But for now this is working for me. Good luck on your recovery. In cheering for you.
Welcome to SD I'm so glad you're here.  ..This sub is a BIG part of the reason I have 49 days. I had been drinking daily and ALOT for over 5 years and was never able to string together more than 3 weeks until I found SD...I encourage you to come here often read often and post/comment when and what you're comfortable with.  ..You may have already read this but the info in the below link has really helped me stay sober because I just don't want to put my body through all that healing again.  https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2sf5jm/my_attempt_at_an_alcohol_recovery_timeline/?_branch_match_id=515980456833967043&amp;st=JJR30RBL&amp;sh=d62b375d..Wishing you all the best on your sober path.  :)..
