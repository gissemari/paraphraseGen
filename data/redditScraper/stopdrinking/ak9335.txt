I escaped unscathed. Mad I got so close but feeling better because at least I didn't drink...What got me out of there was looking through old pictures of my puffy fat hungover face sitting mindfully with my cravings for a bit and reading through quote after quote I've saved about sobriety. Oddly this is the one that changed my mind and gave me strength to drive away: .. Take a deep breath and remember just who the fuck you are.  ..Power in that. ..Two weeks sober tomorrow and 25/27 days sober this year. ..Thanks for being here guys and gals. I draw so much strength from you. You're my people my community my tribe. ..If you're struggling tonight even if you're reading this while under the influence   sad miserable hopeless   keep trying. Keep going. Don't you quit. You've got so many people here who want you to succeed. There's always hope. If you're still breathing if the sun's still shining there's hope. ..All my love ..Jack..

You are awesome!! And the thing you did that was so awesome is you PLANNED AHEAD for this very moment when you would be tempted to drink and you had POWER TOOLS available for the job that kept you centered and able to make the choices you wanted to make. Well done Jack! I hope everyone who reads this post takes a moment to think about their power tools that they keep on hand for when the next craving shows up. You are an inspiration!
I love this! And yes to the 25 of 27 days. They all count!
Congratulations on walking away. It was hard and it will probably happen again but you got through it this time and hopefully it will get a tiny bit easier next time. Two week is awesome just keep chipping away at it day by day.
