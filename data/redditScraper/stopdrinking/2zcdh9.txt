I relapsed at the weekend. I chose to take that first drink. I just couldn't shake it off I was bored and alone - two things that are huge triggers for me. I acted stupid and blacked out. I still drank even though I knew what the consequences would be...Needless to say the last couple of days have been hell. I let a bunch of people down including people from my support group. But worst of all I let myself down big time...Going to get to a meeting the next time the drink-demon starts acting out. Or call one of my support group friends. I can't let it happen again...I won't drink today.

&gt;Going to get to a meeting the next time the drink-demon starts acting out...Personally I have had better results being proactive and getting to meetings before demons start acting out.
Meetings helped me learn sober coping skills and how to live a satisfying life. There is more to getting well than just not drinking. Regular attendance was the key for me. 
Go to a meeting as soon as you can. The best thing for me is to try to not let that drink-demon even get started. Because he kicks my ass. Every. Single. Time. And I'm tired of fighting. Keep that asshole at bay. And I don't want to have that "after drunk guilts" ever again. EVER!!! Thanks for sharing. These kind of posts help keep it fresh for me. Reminds me of the shit I had to trudge thru to find peace. And "I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day.. Take me to the place I love. Take me all the way". Gotta love the red hot chili peppers. :).
