Good morning Sobernauts!..I haven't been posting much although I think about doing so frequently. ..I'm approaching 3 years sober...and it has been a long road full of many challenges and accomplishments.  ..Mouse-in-Sobriety has been:  ..A broken spirit..A wife and caregiver..A friend and family member..A rebellious sponsee..An active member of recovery..A supportive sponsor..A grieving woman in the process of a divorce..A divorcee lost in a new world..A strong single person.  ..Wait...that last one I haven't been yet but I'm working on it.  ....*********************************..My divorce finalized in December.  My lawyer didn't tell me that meant we'd each need to file taxes as Single this year...which means I took a major hit on my taxes.  Blessedly my ex husband and I agreed to split any tax gains/losses this time around.  Still..there have been multiple hits financially as I start over...and emotionally and spiritually.  I'm sad and tired but still standing.  ..I'm improving though. .. I'm a funeral director's daughter and I work for the family business part time.  I'm able to bring some small easement of pain to the overwhelmed people as they deal with loss of a loved one.  I volunteer for charitable organizations and reach out to help those who need a hand up.  I work with women in recovery just as so many did for me.  ..I am healing...but there are others who are struggling more than I am.  I help when I can and accept help when I need.  ..Today is no longer just about "Just one day at a time without drinking".....Drinking isn't on my radar...I have other struggles that would be 1000% worse if alcohol were included.  ..So at this point life is more a matter of:.."What can I do today to heal myself do no further harm and to improve the lives of others in this world?"..Sometimes I fail...sometimes I fail spectacularly...but I'm human.  I'm an alcoholic...I'm an addict...I'm a woman.  I'm sad but unbroken.  ..Today I'm living and enjoying that life.  ..I'm blessed to be sober for another day...Much love..Stay sober my friends...Mouse .

Congratulations on your milestone and thank you for sharing your journey.  It really gives me hope that I can get through the tough times without drinking.
Hi Nonny! It's great to hear from you again...Thanks for your beautiful inspirational post!      
You sound like a very strong woman to me and doing a lot of good in the world. Thanks for posting and well done on getting this far. 
"Drinking isn't on my radar...I have other struggles that would be 1000% worse if alcohol were included." ..I love this.  Whenever I feel down about something that's going on I remember how much worse I'd feel if I were hungover or dealing with the guilt/shame of some alcohol bullshit..
Great post Mouse it's good to hear from you.
Your courageousness is understated...it reads to me that you own yourself obviously a desireable trait of a strong single and sober person. Thanks and best of all blessings to you.
Thank you so much for this. I'll be saving it to revisit. 
Congrats! I'm so proud of you.
What a wonderful and inspirational posting.  Thanks for that.  My favorite bit was: ..&gt;"What can I do today to heal myself do no further harm and to improve the lives of others in this world?"..That's where it's at - of that I'm certain...Pleased to be sober with you today and along on this journey we call life.
Not to get too off topic here but I just watched "my girl" so it's quite coincidental that I came across this post shortly after lol
Sounds like you're doing great Mouse.  I like that your list includes your goal of being a strong single person.  I find that defining a goal really makes it tangible and before I know it there it is :)
Always love hearing from you Mouse. Your words are compelling and inspirational. Keep on keeping on!
Blessings and love to you Mouse.  You're doing A OK.    .~Shine
Good to see you around here Mouse.....THIS! &gt; So at this point life is more a matter of:.."What can I do today to heal myself do no further harm and to improve the lives of others in this world?"
Alcohol is no longer on my radar.  Instead I struggle with life my character defects and other addictions because I am an addict.  Thanks for posting.
I just want you to know that I always read your posts because they were such a lifeline when I first quit drinking and I know I'll find something I need in them.  This one is no exception.  Thank you.
Good morning Mouse.  Lovely to see you here.
