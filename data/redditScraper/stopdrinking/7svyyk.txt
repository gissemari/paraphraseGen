First post in here and I'm grateful to be here! I hope everybody has a great day alive and sober. I wanted to start by saying that I'm a fan of a variety of recovery paths. I'm hitting up meetings (several months sober) and working my steps but I also go to therapy every week practice CBT skills/mindfulness but don't personally subscribe to many of the ideas in AA. Different strokes for different strokes aka whatever works best for you...Something I'm struggling with is sticking to a routine of calling my sponsor every day. They are an amazing person with a very progressive outlook on recovery. One of the things that helps me stay sober is having them there as support. The steps have done nothing for me personally but I enjoy working together...However it's a genuine struggle for me to pick up the phone and make my daily call. It has nothing to do with my sponsor or being selfish or not wanting to make other sober calls. I think I'm still adjusting to even speaking with somebody daily on the phone. I don't even talk to my mom everyday for instance. Often times I'm in a depressed funk and don't feel like talking to anybody whatsoever (which I know...isolation = bad times). I'm social anxious and awkward so I get very flustered when it comes to interacting with people. ..It's been quite a while and I still haven't called my sponsor not for lack of interest or commitment but because I'm stuck in a bad habit/routine of not dialing the phone. Has anybody had any similar experience?

Absolutely! In AA they talk about the  1000 pound phone.  I've been there. Still do it to some extent...It's been my experience that one needs to grow into good habits. That's been for everything I do. It means that I hold myself responsible and that I do things regardless of whether I want to or not. It does not mean that I beat myself up which goes nowhere and which I have a somewhat twisted affection for. Eventually things have changed in me and those things that used to be a struggle are just routine. That's where you want to be.
I'd talk to my sponsor in person about it.
