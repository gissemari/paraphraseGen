Hi /r/stopdrinking ..I found an amazing scholarly article that I haven't seen discussed or mentioned anywhere.  It covers some really amazing topics that I believe should be helpful for anyone suffering from addiction.  Reading it was almost mind blowing for me...The original article can be found here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3887509/..The authors are Eric L. Garland Brett Froeliger and Matthew O. Howard...*I have rather aggresively re-edited the material by hand for reddit's consumption.*  Every sentence from the original article was hand picked for this reddit post.  I put a lot of work into this.  I've added links to Wikipedia added section titles and broken down information in a more friendly way.  I liberally bolded text. I've also bastardized their hard work by adding reference to various internet memes and adding my own personal flavor. *Like a boss.*..**Summary**..Prominent neuroscience models suggest that **addictive behavior occurs when environmental stressors and drug-relevant cues** activate a **cycle of cognitive affective and psychophysiological mechanisms** that compel the user to seek out and use drugs m'kay? **Mindfulness-based interventions** (MBIs) target pathogenic mechanisms of the risk chain linking stress and addiction. ..Empirical evidence is presented suggesting that MBIs ameliorate addiction by enhancing cognitive regulation of a number of key processes including: clarifying cognitive appraisal and modulating negative emotions to reduce perseverative cognition and emotional arousal; enhancing metacognitive awareness to regulate drug-use action schema and decrease addiction attentional bias; promoting *extinction learning to uncouple drug-use triggers from conditioned appetitive responses*; reducing cue-reactivity and increasing cognitive control over craving; attenuating physiological stress reactivity through parasympathetic activation; and increasing savoring to restore natural reward processing.  Heavy shit I know but just keep reading...**Introduction**..Although addiction has been a subject of societal concern for millennia over the past several decades discoveries from cognitive and affective neuroscience have deepened our understanding of this age-old vexing and pernicious problem. The perspective emerging from several lines of research is one in which addiction is seen as a **cycle of compulsive drug-seeking behavior** fueled by [dysregulated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_dysregulation) neurocognitive processes. Key processes implicated in addiction include motivated attention automaticity reward processing emotion regulation stress reactivity and inhibitory control. ..Key terms: ..* Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) not to be confused with..* Men in Black (MIBs)..* Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention ..* Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement..**A Neurocognitive Model of Addiction**..*Addictive responses arise from automatic habits and unregulated craving.*..Research with animals and humans demonstrates that chronic (*giggle*) administration of psychoactive drugs results in adaptations in multiple neurotransmitter systems in the brain consequentially altering functional neural circuitry that governs a broad array of interactive processes (e.g. affect and reward habit learning and memory and cognitive control over prepotent environmental stimuli). Current research suggests that the dopamine system plays a critical role in the progression from drug initiation to chronic and habitual self-administration. **As such drug-related cues come to evoke powerful conditioned motivational responses that may be fully dissociable from the pleasure and reward elicited by drug use.**  Think about Pavlov's dog here that's you...**The habitual behavioral response to drug-related cues is thought to be coordinated by drug-use action schemas i.e. memory systems that drive drug seeking and drug use.** Importantly cue-reactivity confers compulsivity to drug-seeking behaviors motivating the redditor to consume drugs even after long periods of abstinence and despite countervailing motivations to remain abstinent particularly in contexts that elicit unregulated stress and negative affect. Indeed stress biases behavior toward habitual responding.  You know the drill...Because obtaining and consuming psychoactive substances are motivationally salient goals in addiction drug-use action schemas stored in memory guide implicit cognitive processing of stimuli associated with previous drug-use episodes. This implicit cognitive process is manifested as a preferential focus of attention toward drug-related cues known as [addiction attentional bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attentional_bias). When attention is focused on drug-related cues motivation for drug-use increases which then amplifies the salience of the curs. As such the poor redittor may find him or herself consuming drugs without awareness of the intention to use in much the same way other complex goal-oriented thought-action repertoires can be engaged habitually without conscious volition by conditioned contextual cues.  I know right?..**Down down down we go**..As the addictive habit becomes more entrenched individuals struggling with addiction experience a loss of cognitive and get all Charlie Sheen on everyone. As a result of cognitive control deficits actively addicted persons may experience an intense overwhelming compulsion and motivation to seek and use drugs that is difficult to regulate. Moreover persons in recovery from addiction often experience the impulse to *light that bitch up* despite their desire to remain abstinent. Yet due to deficient or atrophied proactive cognitive control such individuals may attempt to reactively inhibit this upwelling of unbidden motivational drive by employing  willpower  to suppress the urge to engage in the addictive behavior. **Thus the pendulum of prefrontal regulation swings from a context of under-control to one of over-control.** Through such over-control suppression may promote relapse insofar as this cognitive strategy inadvertently results in a  rebound effect  i.e. an increased rate of the thoughts and emotions it is directed against. To make a long story short you end up wasting a ton of brain energy going back and forth in your brain even more so than Hillary Clinton's flip flops on Iraq or gay marriage. Individuals who rely on suppression as a regulatory strategy exhibit greater amygdala activation in response to negative emotional information than individuals who tend to use reappraisal. **The use of *suppression* to rid oneself of craving or affective states once they have already arisen is costly in terms of neurocognitive resources and likely to fail**.  Simply avoiding these thoughts won't work chief...This failure to resolve conflict between emotional drives (e.g. craving) and higher-order goals (e.g. the goal of abstinence) during attempted suppression may further bias cognitive processing toward drug-related cues and mental contents inadvertently increasing attention to substance-related thoughts and urges. Consequently suppression of thoughts of substance use leads to greater enactment of consummatory behaviors. **When addictive urges are chronically suppressed over time the neurocognitive resources for self-regulation are depleted resulting in an inability to inhibit substance-related cognitions and an attentional bias toward drug-related cues**. Ultimately regulatory resource depletion that occurs during sustained suppression of urges may contribute to relapse.  You can't just sweep your thoughts under the carpet it ain't going to work.  Keep reading...**Break it down for me**..From a neurocognitive perspective **addiction occurs through basic human learning processes gone awry; neural resources devoted to learning become hijacked** due to the neuropharmacologically rewarding properties of the substance. Once an intentional decision over time **the act of seeking and consuming drugs is established as an automatic compulsive habit one that becomes increasingly difficult to inhibit** as brain structures involved in self-regulation become dysregulated by the combined action of stress and the pharmacologic agent itself. Unwittingly the struggle to reassert control over the addictive behavior through misguided attempts at urge suppression results in hypervigilance for salient cues such as the sight of a bar an old  hang-out  spot or a familiar  drinking buddy  which trigger uncomfortable physical sensations and a strong desire to consume substances even after extended periods of abstinence. Eventually the addict succumbs and relapses which strengthens the addictive habit through the processes of conditioning and negative reinforcement. Hence behavioral interventions that aim to interrupt automatized drug-use action schemas and restore more normalized reward learning processes may prove to be beneficial in helping drug abusers maintain abstinence. **Similarly treatment approaches that train context-dependent prefrontally mediated cognitive control as an alternative to the maladaptive strategy of suppressing addictive urges** may free neurocognitive resources for the effective regulation of emotional distress and substance craving. It is in these regards that MBIs may be especially efficacious for the treatment of addiction.  In other words simply avoiding the thoughts related to addiction is not a winning strategy   one must roll up their sleeves and purposely dig into their own thought patterns when a craving occurs...**Mindfulness Training Ameliorates Addiction by Targeting Neurocognitive Mechanisms.  (Boom There Goes The Dynamite)**..Although mindfulness is an English term linked with a set of contemplative practices and principles originating in Asia a bajillion years ago in its modern usage mindfulness refers to a psychological phenomenon currently being studied for its relevance to mental and physical health in fields such as medicine psychology and neuroscience. The practice of **mindfulness involves two primary components: focused attention and open monitoring**. During focused attention attention is sustained on an object while the practitioner alternately acknowledges and lets go of distracting thoughts and emotions. Objects of focused attention practice can include the sensation of breathing; the sensation of walking; interoceptive and proprioceptive feedback about the body's internal state movement and position; and visual stimuli (e.g. a candle flame). Focused attention practices are often the precursor to open monitoring forms of mindfulness meditation. **During open monitoring a state of metacognitive awareness is cultivated wherein mental contents are allowed to arise unperturbed without suppression or distraction** while the *quality of awareness itself remains the primary focus of attention*. This state of awareness is metacognitive in the sense that it involves monitoring the content of consciousness while reflecting back upon the process or quality of consciousness itself. In other words **the redditor maintains awareness of the *locus of attention* (without trying to retain focus on a particular object)** and his or her level of cognitive arousal **without reacting to or elaborating on any particular content of consciousness**...**Engaging in these practices repeatedly over time may induce neural and cognitive plasticity**; recurrent activation of the mindful state during meditation may leave lasting neurobiological traces that accrue into durable changes in the dispositional propensity to be mindful in everyday life even while not meditating. Germane to the current discussion of neurocognition in addiction **dispositional mindfulness is significantly inversely associated with addiction attentional bias and craving positively associated with autonomic recovery from stress and substance cue-exposure**...**Through focused attention and open monitoring forms of meditation MBIs exercise a number of neurocognitive processes believed to go awry in addiction.** Indeed MBIs may be fruitfully conceptualized as means of training or exercising prefrontally mediated cognitive control networks which have become atrophied or usurped in the service of drug seeking and use. By strengthening PFC functions and the ability of the PFC to modulate other brain networks in a context-dependent manner MBIs may provide the global benefit of enhancing neurocognitive flexibility   augmenting a  domain-general  resource that may then be applied across the manifold subcomponent processes implicated in psychological health (e.g. cognitive regulation of automaticity attention appraisal emotion urges stress reactivity reward processing and extinction learning). ..http://i.imgur.com/Uogvi4h.jpg..Image: Mindfulness-centered regulation: the central tenet of this model posits that mindfulness-based interventions (MBI's) may remediate dysregulated habit behaviors craving and affect primarily by way of strengthening functional connectivity....**Habit responses**..Still with me?  This is where shit gets real...Substance dependent individuals typically experience euphoria during initial stages of drug-use. Yet as experience with the drug increases the reward associated with drug-taking becomes dramatically attenuated. Despite diminishing returns in positive emotional experiences resulting from hittin' that dope chronic dependent users continue to use. **Undergirded by neuroplastic changes in striatal circuitry habitual drug-use becomes an overlearned process that can become automatized.**..Mindfulness training may enhance functional connectivity in a cortico-thalamic loop including prefrontal cingulate parietal and dorsal thalamus nodes strengthening an executive regulatory circuit providing feedback to the striatum and medial temporal lobe. **This feedback process is theorized to allow for greater consciousness of thoughts and behaviors that were previously enacted with little conscious awareness.**..The practice of mindfulness in daily life is focused on developing awareness of automatic behavior. Indeed many MBIs prescribe **informal mindfulness practices where individuals are instructed to engage in everyday repetitive tasks (e.g. washing the dishes) with full consciousness of the sensorimotor aspects of the activity.** Such informal mindfulness practices are designed to reduce mind-wandering and strengthen conscious control over automaticity. Potentially as a result of such practices **mindfulness training has been shown to decrease habit behavior and reduce rigid adherence to scripted cognitive responses**. When closing the reddit tab on your browser take a moment to think about what you actually want to do next before you automatically reload the site. These findings accord with early theoretical accounts which conceptualized mindfulness meditation as a form of  deautomatization  whereby patterns of motor and perceptual responses which had been rendered automatic and unconscious through repetition are reinvested with conscious attention. Thus is plausible that mindfulness training may deautomatize habitual addictive responses through both formal meditations focused on regulating automatic appetitive impulses as well as informal mindfulness practices designed to increase generalized awareness of automaticity. ..**BOOBS!  I mean Attentional Bias**..Mindfulness training may strengthen the capacity to regulate attention in the face of conditioned stimuli associated with past substance use countering attentional biases by refocusing attention on neutral or health-promoting stimuli (e.g. the sensation of one's own breath or a beautiful sunset). **Repeatedly redirecting attention from substance-related cues toward innocuous stimuli may foster extinction of associations between substance-related cues and drug-use action schema**. When you see someone else use a drug don't just shut it out of your mind   create a new positive thought pattern off it. This potential mechanism may explain how attentional bias modification among addicts leads to decreased substance use and improved treatment outcomes...**Cue-elicited craving**..Mindfulness-based interventions may positively influence craving-related processes in several ways. First **mindfulness training may decrease [bottom-up reactivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salience_(neuroscience) to drug-related stimuli**. Second **mindfulness training may decouple negative emotion from craving**. Although negative emotion is a common precipitant of craving and subsequent relapse mindfulness training may extinguish this association such that an addict experiencing sadness fear or anger could allow these emotions to arise and pass without triggering an appetitive reaction. Indeed substance dependent individuals participating in Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention were less likely to experience craving in response to depressed mood and this reduced craving and reactivity to negative emotion predicted fewer days of substance use...The theory is that conscious craving occurs when an activated drug-use action schema is blocked from obtaining the goal of drug consumption. As such **persons in acute withdrawal persons unable to obtain drugs (e.g. due to lack of funds or availability) or persons attempting to maintain abstinence in the face of triggers may experience an upwelling of craving for substances**. Ring a bell? Yeah.  I thought so. In contrast according to this theory addicts who are able to obtain and use drugs in an unimpeded fashion would not experience craving. Similarly persons in long-term residential treatment who are isolated from drug-related cues are unlikely to be conscious of craving. **Without awareness of craving the addict may unwittingly remain in high-risk situations and thus be especially subject to relapse as soon as they bust out of that joint.** Indeed lack of awareness of substance craving has been shown to be predictive of future relapse. MBIs may increase conscious access to the appetitive drive to use substances by virtue of their effects on increasing interoceptive awareness. ..**The recovering addict may utilize mindfulness training to become aware of *which* cues are under the spotlight of attention and become more sensitive to *how* those cues may trigger changes in body state and motivation drive. So so money.**..Hence mindfulness may increase awareness of craving and thereby facilitate cognitive control of otherwise automatic appetitive impulses. ..**Cognitive appraisal (the personal interpretation of a situation)**..Insofar as stress evokes automatic responses and impairs prefrontally mediated cognitive control functions exposure to socioenvironmental stressors may render addicts in recovery vulnerable to relapse.  Mindfulness training may allay stress-induced relapse by virtue of its stress-reductive effects. Although early theorists believed that mindfulness meditation reduced stress primarily by evoking a generalized relaxation response modern research indicates that mindfulness practice may also attenuate stress by targeting cognitive mechanisms. Oh. What's that?  It's 1950 on the phone and they want their research back.  One potential target of mindfulness is cognitive appraisal the process whereby stimuli and their environmental context are evaluated for their significance to the self. Appraisals of threat or harm elicit negative emotional reactions coupled with activation of stress physiology. **When recurrent such emotional reactivity biases perception leading to exaggerated overestimated appraisals of threat and underestimations of self-efficacy and ultimately sensitization to future stressors.** Sound familiar?..In contrast mindfulness which has been conceptualized as a non-reactive form of awareness may enable the redditor to cognitively appraise his or her present circumstances with less emotional bias and to more accurately assess his or her ability to cope with present challenges. ..**Not Going All Kanye West**..When individuals are unable to marshal effective problem-solving to resolve a stressor lack of a favorable resolution may lead to deployment of emotion regulation efforts to manage the emotional distress elicited by the stressful circumstance. Individuals with elevated negative affect at baseline who later received mindfulness training exhibited increased emotion regulatory capacity coupled with greater recruitment of attentional control resources and reduced amygdala activation during exposure to negative self-relevant stimuli. Thus by **enhancing top-down cognitive control over emotional responses in a context-dependent fashion MBIs may reduce drug use precipitated by negative affective states.**..Mindfulness training may promote cognitive reappraisal the process by which the meaning of a stressful or adverse event is re-construed so as to reduce its negative emotional impact.   Why do I feel so shitty when I see a back alley?  Should I really feel that way ? Why? . During an adverse experience mindfulness practitioners first disengage from initial negative appraisals into the metacognitive state of mindfulness in which cognitions and emotions are viewed and accepted as transitory mental events without inherent veridicality. Subsequently the scope of attention broadens to encompass a larger set of previously unattended information from which new situational appraisals may be generated. By accessing this enlarged set of contextual data present circumstances may be reappraised in an adaptive fashion that promotes positive affect and behavioral activation. **For instance a newly abstinent alcohol dependent individual might reappraise an affront by a former  drinking buddy  as evidence of their need to build new sober relationships.** This context-dependent use of prefrontal regulatory strategy represents a  middle way  between hypo- and hyper-activation of cognitive control resources thereby preventing resource depletion and untoward rebound effects...**STRESS   Y U NO LEAVE ME ALONE?**..In addition to pro-regulatory effects on emotion mindfulness training may facilitate neurocognitive regulation of the effects of stress on the autonomic nervous system. **As addicts in treatment develop dispositional mindfulness through mindfulness training they may be more able to engage prefrontal cortical modulation of the sympathetic  fight-or-flight  response via parasympathetic nervous system activation of the  vagal brake  resulting in increased HRV and heart-rate deceleration in the face of stress or addictive cues.** Autonomic flexibility engendered through mindfulness training may help persons in recovery from addiction adapt to situational demands without succumbing to a stress-precipitated relapse again like a boss...**Show me the Neurons baby**..With repeated drug-use neural sensitization may occur whereby the drug elicits a potent response in striatal-dopamine neurons coupled with a strong degree of positive reinforcement. **At the same time long-term exposure to drugs significantly attenuates neural responses to intrinsically rewarding stimuli in the environment (e.g. a beautiful landscape the smile of a baby a delicious meal).** In other words through neuroadaptation the addicted individual learns to experience reward via **self-administration of drugs rather than by enjoying the subtle beauty of the natural environment** or the affiliative or health-promoting objects found therein. This **rewiring** (OMG there's that word) of reward learning entrenches the drug user in a cycle of drug-taking that serves to maintain the ongoing use of drugs. Indeed vulnerability to relapse has been attributed to increased incentive salience of drug-cues and decreased salience of intrinsically rewarding stimuli. ..**By teaching participants to mindfully attend to pleasurable objects events and lolz MBIs may amplify hedonic processing of natural rewards and thereby counter the allostatic effects of addiction on reward neurocircuitry.** This form of selective attention to positive experience known as savoring is one of the most robust positive emotion regulation strategies. **During savoring one not only attends to a broadened diversity and range of sensations and perceptions but also to the positive emotions elicited by the sensory-perceptual experience**. As such attending to present-moment experience prospectively predicts positive emotion.  Kinda like that fucking book *The Secret* which ought to be burned. Anyway learning to mindfully savor pleasant events may offset negative affective states that often trigger addictive responses and restore the salience of naturally occurring and intrinsically rewarding objects and events (e.g. social affiliation healthy diet and exercise behaviors engagement with novel and stimulus-rich environments etc.). **Through mindful savoring MBIs may provide a means of reward replenishment and ultimately reverse the reward deficiency syndrome inherent in addiction   a therapeutic process plausibly important for allaying craving and deterring relapse.** So don't just enjoy that In-and-Out burger fucking *make love to it* right on the counter *animal style*...**Kill it with fire**..Individuals in early recovery from addiction often **attempt to suppress craving for drugs and alcohol as a means of maintaining abstinence**. However these suppression attempts often backfire resulting *in a sad panda* and a consequent rebound of substance-related thoughts. Critically attempted avoidance of substance cue-reactivity may prevent extinction learning from occurring which requires inhibition of conditioned responses in the presence of conditioned stimuli. In contrast mindfulness training provides an effective alternative to suppressing unwanted substance-related thoughts emotions and urges by **promoting acceptance of and exposure to these mental experiences**. By learning to not sweep everything under the fucking carpet Mindful exposure to substance-related thoughts and cues may prevent the post-suppression rebound effect and facilitate desensitization to conditioned stimuli.  When engaged over time this practice might result in extinction learning of previously conditioned associations between substance cue-reactivity and addictive behaviors...**What Have We Learned Reddit?**..In contrast to mindfulness which leads to cognitive and behavioral flexibility addiction may be characterized by mindlessness i.e. habitual or scripted responses that are often deployed automatically without conscious volition or regard for goodness-of-fit with present goals or the socioenvironmental context. **Although procurement of many psychoactive substances requires significant planning and intentionality the appetitive drive that motivates drug seeking may emerge in a context of mindlessness manifested as obsessional thoughts of using and compulsive urges that seem to arise in an unbidden and intrusive fashion in direct contradiction to rational decision making.** Moreover the behavioral routines involved in the ritual of drug administration can become automated and executed mindlessly in much the same was as other complex repertoires can be engaged without conscious volition by conditioned contextual cues. Hence individuals treated for substance dependence with higher levels of mindlessness tend to experience higher levels of craving and consume larger quantities of addictive substances than their more mindful counterparts. These findings suggest that habitual reflexive responding can confer vulnerability to individuals in recovery. ..**Conversely greater attention to and awareness of one's reactions to substance-related cues predicts less substance use among persons in recovery from addiction**. In light of Tiffany's proposal (*wait who the fuck is Tiffany?*) that automaticity drives appetitive addictive responses mindfulness of one's automatized reactions would presumably allow for greater self-regulation of mindless reactions elicited by drug-cues and increase proactive cognitive control over substance use.  ..**Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement places a special emphasis on providing training in mindful savoring as an approach to restoring natural reward responsiveness.** Concomitantly a growing recognition of the role of attentional suggestes that regular brief mindfulness practice of focused attention on respiratory sensations strengthens electrophysiological indices of enhanced attentional control. Conversely open monitoring forms of mindfulness meditation might be most useful for generating awareness of cue-elicited activation of drug-use action schemas and could enable the practitioner to regain conscious cognitive control of automatized addictive behavioral routines. ..When a recovering addict with a history of using drugs to cope with negative emotions encounters a cue associated with past drug-use episodes while in the context of a stressful environment (e.g. walking past a bar after getting in an argument with a work supervisor) this encounter may activate cortico-limbic-striatal circuits subserving **drug-use action schemas**. After completing a course in mindfulness training the addict may become more aware of the *automatic addictive habit as it is activated* allowing for top-down regulation of the precipitating negative emotional state and the bottom-up appetitive urge. **Specifically the individual may engage in mindful breathing to first disengage from and then restructure negative cognitive appraisals thereby reducing limbic (e.g. amygdala) activity autonomic reactivity and dysphoric emotions related to the stressor.** Concurrently the individual may become aware of **when his attention has been automatically captured** by the sight of people drinking in the window of the bar and through formal mindfulness practice activate fronto-parietal mediated attentional networks to disengage and **shift focus onto the neutral sensation of respiration**. During this process as sensations of craving arise the individual may engage in metacognitive monitoring of these sensations and in so doing facilitate prefrontal down-regulation of limbic-striatal activation. **As mindfulness of craving is sustained over time without drug-use the sensations of craving may abate** promoting extinction learning to weaken associative linkages between conditioned addiction-related stimuli and the attendant conditioned appetitive response. **Once working memory has been cleared of active representations of substance use the redditor may shift attention to savor non-drug related rewards such as the sense of accomplishment that may arise from successfully resisting the temptation to drink (i.e. self-efficacy) appreciating an episode of Rick & Morty without being clouded by inebriation or the comforting touch of a kitteh in your lap.** Through repeated practice of regulating addictive responses and extracting pleasure from life in the absence of substance use the individual may re-establish healthy dopaminergic tone and foster neuroplasticity in brain areas subserving increased dispositional mindfulness...To wrap this shit up mindfulness may facilitate a novel adaptive response to the canonical  people places and things  that tend to elicit addictive behavior as a scripted habitual reaction. In so doing the practice of mindfulness may attenuate stress reactivity and suppression while disrupting addictive automaticity resulting in an increased ability to regulate and recover from addictive urges. The tools of modern science have only begun to elucidate the many ways in which mindfulness training targets the risk chain of addiction at the attention-appraisal-emotion interface because you know *that's a thing*...TL;DR: This WAS the TLDR the original article was longer ;)

tl:dr..Sitting for even three minutes a day focusing on your breathing can literally change your life.
Also this is amazing. I have read the paper before for school and love seeing this here.
Love it!..
Jesus. .TL/DR mindfulness is good

Holy wall o text. Without reading it I can tell you that mindfulness has been essential to my sobriety. Sometimes I think I forget to mention it when sharing my experience because it has just become part of who I am. Thanks for the reminder that I need to do so. 
Thank you so much for sharing this.  I am really interested in figuring out why my brain is lying to itself and how to fix that.  I am starting to think the cognitive dissonance surrounding my alcohol use was becoming as much of a problem on a day-in-and-day-out basis as the consequences of the alcohol in and of itself.  Like from a mental health stand point maybe it would be better to just be sober or be a full-time alcoholic than spend all my sober time wanting to drink and all my drunk time wanting to be sober.  Pick a side brain!  Just leave me alone!  Even just writing this post which I now realize may have fuck-all to do with the article I just read has made my head hurt.
Thank you for taking the time to share this and for inserting little funny bits throughout! :)
Well shit. I like this guy's style.
Wow. Now that's a post. I skimmed a bit got interested  saved it for later.
Wow - so glad to find this! Thanks for your post - loved your edits! Like a boss!
