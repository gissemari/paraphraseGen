Hello..I posted this a month ago and I am posting it again now because some people commented that they liked the idea/it was helpful to them...I am just over a year sober and I wanted to share something I did that helped me get through the year...One thing I did was to write myself a letter for the first day of each month...So I wrote myself 7 letters because I started this 5 months in. I wrote all of the letters in the 5th month and I wrote them with my future self in mind. I knew a lot of the problems I would face thanks to help from others and I knew what I personally struggled with a lot such as harsh self-criticism...So I would write for example in a letter: "It's ok if you have not accomplished every goal in your life already; it takes time." or "This month will probably be very difficult because this is the month that ____ but here is how you can deal with that and you've got this.".I also put things of meaning into each envelope such as a kind note from a supportive friend or quotes I like...I also put a short list of short and easy goals such as "learn one new song this month" or other easily accomplishable items...On the first of every month I opened my letter and I read my letter to myself the kind note from a friend and a short list of easily attainable goals...This made me feel better and it allowed me to see progress even as I would not acknowledge it myself...Maybe some other people will find this idea helpful...Thank you for your support.
