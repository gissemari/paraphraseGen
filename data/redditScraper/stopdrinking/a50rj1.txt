Hey everyone! I am a long time member of this sub and am usually pretty active on my main account but I felt like Ive had a tough last week and am pretty not proud of how I handled things. I just wanted to share from an anonymous account because for me the more I vocalize and open up about what Im struggling with the more I can get help and more importantly I can articulate to myself on how to help myself. Because we are our own best friend or worst enemy right? And most of the time the choice between the two is up to me and I would like to start taking responsibility for that decision...                Well a bit of backstory I am a 25 year old recent college grad (took 6 years because of alcohol cocaine and heroin abuse) and I got a good degree from a good school. I have been clean and sober since February 1st 2017 the day I called my dad and asked for help and to go to rehab. I am incredibly blessed to have a family who could support me emotionally and financially to get help and amazing friends who allow me to be vulnerable and open about all of it without judging me or ever excluding me in any way... I was back home or at school they were my support system in combination with therapy and meetings. But I accepted a job in Europe and moved out here a week ago. It doesnt pay as well as all the engineering jobs back stateside but as a 25 year old who isnt tied down it seemed like a dream opportunity that would probably never come back around. I am in a new country where I dont know anyone I speak French at a Kindergarten level and know no German and Im just feeling lost. .. I have felt like Ive been drowning for the last week and Ive tried to hide from it by staying as busy as possible. Between work exploring Zurich sports and talking to my best friend back home Ive been trying to avoid the one person who brings me down: that asshole in my head... .This weekend I could hide from him no longer. I bailed on my bestie twice I skipped out on soccer practice (Im a basketball and football player but hey Im in Europe so lets try new things) just in general Ive been in a funk. An absolute rut. And the worst part of this is the 30 minutes between when I go to bed and I actually fall asleep. its been miserable the last few days. The using dreams have come back more vivid and lifelike than ever. I got some outside perspective on it that clicked for me. In paraphrase: Youre in a new place with new people and a new culture nothing right now is familiar or comfortable for you. And so your mind is turning to the easiest comfort available alcohol and drugs...                .So i did what Ive done before and i went to a pharmacy here and bought sleeping pills. Now I have a bad history with them. I've never used them to get high but I have used them to try to sleep forever before. I bought these sleeping pills Saturday morning and left them on my counter staring at them. I didnt intend to do anything wrong with them just to help knock me out and let me hide from myself a bit longer. .. I had a total meltdown yesterday. I called my sister and my friend about them and was convinced to flush them because nothing good has ever come from them before. I feel like Im fucking drowning but if youre drowning then you need to be fucking clear headed and sober to tread water and swim back to land...I've always had pride in myself for being a strong person but I dont feel like it anymore because recently my strength hasnt come from me; Ive had to ask for it from other people. I almost lost it this weekend but through the strength of those who love me I didnt. That wasnt me that was because of them. And I am struggling to find that kind of community and love here in Zurich. ..                                                                                                                                                . I know this was a total ramble but I needed to share and I did go to a meeting and share most of this but I felt like I needed to again. I dont know if I made a point or not but I really just needed to say that I am having a tough time and I am happy and blessed to have the best friends and family but I am also not happy with myself. I thought the whole jumble of hypocritical thoughts and emotions might be something yall could relate to. ..                                                                                                                                                .But if theres one thing Im holding onto its that even after this past week my sober date is still February 1st 2017. And I want to fucking keep it that way and I want to share be open and vulnerable with you guys. Hopefully next time Ill have the balls to post from my main. Either way if youre still reading this thank you and I love you. For real..I will not drink with you today.

I heard someone in NY share about a meeting in Switzerland during her very early sobriety and how amazing it was to be with a group of recovering people in such a distant place...it was actually this elderly woman with like 60 years and she shared this story over and over not remembering she had just shared it.  ..Anyway now I feel like I heard it all those times to tell to you.  Her name is Peggy.  I moved so I'm not sure if she still is alive she was like 90...She had such fond amazing memories of this Switzerland meeting.  Have you tried one there?  
I second trying to find a meeting. Language barrier or not you will have a shared understanding of the struggle to stay clean w all of the people in the room.  ..I've never lived aboard before but what's worked for me when I've felt like I was drowning was just taking it literally one hour at a time. Same thing I'm doing now trying to build a sober life. You're a strong and brave person to have gone through all you have and come out a college grad w a loving family and good friends.  Friend I'm pulling for you and pray you start to feel more like yourself again.
