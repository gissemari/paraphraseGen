[Guess what day it is!?!? .](http://hotmeme.net/media/i/5/a/grZ-seeing-camels-on-hump-day.jpg)..Good morning fellow sobernauts! Hump days are where we calibrate our sobriety check in see how our /sd buds are doing and support each other in our sobriety...Here in WuW we all share our struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations in the format below. Let's talk about it!..**Triumph**: After dilly-dallying for weeks I finally got up the guts to talk to about my sobriety to someone new and important in my life. It was scary but it went well and I feel so much better for it. I was well prepared and knew what I wanted to say and how I wanted to say it. It went well. I'm pleased. ..**Struggle**: My struggle is related to my triumph natch. Now that I've opened the door I want to share All The Things and tell All The Stories. People are telling me that's not a good idea and I'm thinking they're right. I'm trying to get my head around the idea that being "honest" with people doesn't always equate to forcing them to sit and listen to ten years' worth of horror stories around the things I've done. ..**General Chat**: I spent a lot of time yesterday thinking about spring and how awesome it's gonna be to be sober when it's sunny and warm and the flowers are blooming and the bees are buzzing and yay I'm so excited for spring!..BRB - gonna go crank up all the space heaters sigh...Have a great and happy hump day all!

Hi..I'll ill so this is an odd one for me:..**Triumph**: I'm in the process of signing up for something life changing... I'm gonna share more when it's confirmed!..**Struggle**: Aformentioned illness! Just been sent home from work. Usually I refuse to go home ill because I blame myself for my hangover making my illness worse but today I was just bona-fide genuinely ill for the first time since quitting so I've gone home. It feels weird and I'm not used to it. Gonna eat crap and go to bed...**General Chat**: I've had similar thoughts to you cake_or_radish! I was lying on my bed a few days ago when we had the first warm couple of days for months and the light was streaming in my cats had found sun patches and the air smelt and felt fresh! I'm really excited about it too in a way that's difficult to articulate!
Hello everyone I'm newly sober and here's my WuW..**Triumph:** I've finally had a breakthrough and told my wife about my drinking problem. She hugged me and supports my decision. I thought she'd be very upset with me and it was completely the opposite reaction that I'd anticipated...**Struggle:**  Though I am happy and relieved I have little thoughts about drinking. I have alcohol still in the house but it's not for me they were nice gifts from people that I've been saving. Also there are some nice beers in the fridge I'd been saving. I'm thinking about just giving them away...**General Chat:** I'm glad this sub exists keeps me mentally busy when I'm alone and keeps my mind off of drinking(odd because this thread is about alcohol). ..Thanks!
**Triumph**:I nervously attended my first meeting last night. After 3 nights not drinking or being sick I actually woke up feeling awake this morning. .**Struggle**: I don't know how to manage or cope through triggers very well. .**General Chat**: Looking forward to warmer days so I can get my kids out to the park.
Triumph-excellent meetings yesterday at work.Struggle-I wish my love for that one glass of wine would stop hounding me.General-I truly love chocolate AND tomorrow is the official 2 in my star!
**triumph** last night i was very emotional. We don't think my nanna is going to last much longer and it's breaking my heart. I need to build a Genogram for school and it's been quite a journey back in time. ..The triumph: instead of eating my feelings I called my husband and cried. Yay coping!..**Struggle** aforementioned emotional issues. Just learned my great great grandfather was probably an alcoholic. My great grandfather didn't allow any alcohol in the house because of this. ..**chat** my dad's side is from Isle of Skye and Birmingham. Mom's side is from Czech Republic and other half is Romanian gypsy. Cool!
Triumph: came clean to my family about my drinking and openly commuted to sobriety. The greatest surprise was that it wasn't a surprise to them. I kind of saw that coming though...Struggle: this isn't my first attempt at sobriety and starting over again seems daunting but I know most of all its necessary...Positive reflection: I didn't have the worst withdrawals because I did manage to cut back the amount I was drinking after earlier experiments with sobriety taught me I don't need that much hooch at all. But that isn't an excuse to drink ever again.
**Triumph:** My sleep is finally better! I'm waking up about 7 hours after I fall asleep alarm clock or no. So far this week I've started every day early enough to feel on top of things. I had a lot of trouble dragging myself out of bed even after 8-9 hours up until just about a week ago. Maybe this is a fluke but I like to imagine it's a delayed sobriety benefit. ..**Struggle:** My husband and I have a week of vacation coming up. We're visiting my parents and doing some hiking/camping in the area. This is all good news but it's challenging. A difficult personal anniversary will occur at the end of the vacation week. We've never been out of town without drinking too much nearly every night before and I've never been sober for this anniversary. I don't think I've even been camping without alcohol since age 12. I know I need a plan but "one day at a time" thinking/avoidance is the only way I've been keeping calm about it so far. Something to work on this week...**General:** More spring excitement. :) Snow here should be melting soon. 
**Triumph:** Another Day Alive and well.  I am 38 days sober and went to my 40th meeting today.  I have started being point on a project for work that is going smoothly also...**Struggle:** Step 2 and 3 I understand them and I get it but as someone who has been agnostic for the passed 13ish years It's hard.  Small story short I had a high school friend who died in a car crash where a priest fell asleep at the wheel and killed my friend and his friend.  The priest survived.  I prayed that night and said I understand and was very depressed and just asked for happiness.  One week later I found out my dad had cancer.  He survived it and I am thankful for that but as a 16 year old who was slightly depressed that was a lot to take and it was hard.  Maybe it's his way of saying things become better but its still hard to get over that.  If anyone has advice or help here please let me know.  I have the 12 for 12 book and am on this chapter but have yet to find time to read it....**General Chat:** I am thankful for everyone here.  Hopefully everyone is having a good day!  I've been really into the show Better Call Sal lately.  If you haven't seen it and were a fan of breaking bad I would consider watching it.
Wee..**Triumph**: I walked into a raging party sober. I walked out of a raging party sober..**Struggle**: I walked into a raging party sober for some reason..**Chart**: I'm not getting the gains I would like working out but that's my own fault hur. Other than that my life is PRETTY FUCKING PEACHY :D..T - edit -i we todd it. sofa king we todd it..
I know I'm already posting daily about the minutia of my sobriety but I *do* so love WuW.....**Triumph** I've been feeling physically and emotionally slightly less awesome than I did in the first week or so of sobriety and life has thrown in some unexpected hurdles. However I'm still keeping pretty much on task with my sobriety goals and most importantly I'm staying sober!..**Struggle** Tiredness. Life being life-y...**General Chat** For those of you who are wondering how my yowling cat is doing... I put a litterbox by the basement door he is obsessed with. He uses it and that seemed to help with the door specific yowling. However he made a couple of mad dashes outside through our legs. Once was with me when I was going out the kitchen door in back and once was through my husband's legs out the front door. We're in a residential urban neighborhood and we have a small fenced in back yard. But there's a lot of traffic parked cars and dog walkers in front - it could turn into a nightmare real quick if he keeps darting out the door. Plus it's really cold here right now so I can't exactly leave the house for several hours if he's in the back yard which means taking the time to catch him and bring him in...So my new strategy is to let him out through the basement door into the backyard twice a day before he gets fed. Even with the snow he's pretty adventurous about exploring. I suspect that this cat is going to meet an untimely end but at least he'll die what he loves doing. The rescue we got him from made us promise to keep him as an indoor cat but..... that just ain't happening...I do refuse to get to the point where I'm opening and closing the door for him a million times a day. But at least now when he's yowling in the basement I feel comfortable ignoring him...
**Triumph:** Still hanging in. It sounds so basic but this is surprising to me considering how the temptation has amped up over the last 4 or so days...**Struggle:** The temptation has really amped up over the last 4 or so days. Nothing triggering it. Perfectly fine one minute and then *omgIwantAbottleofwineRightNoworImightripyourfaceoff!* I don't actually say that of course :)  Yay! I love sobriety!/huffpuffgrumbleHoldOnGrrrr - a freakin yo-yo..I am looking forward to this phase passing...**General Chat:** I love my doggies. Not only are they awesome just being them taking care of them after work takes my focus off of me for a nice chunk of time. I *especially appreciate* my 8 mo. old lab/hound. He has this great gentle patience when it comes to what I've considered his way of giving me a time out... He sits quietly and slowly leans his hulk into me until his head is resting under my chin no matter how I try to push him away because I'm "busy". Once his forehead is pressed against my sternum he just relaxes and let me support all his weight.  Every time he does this I have to wonder if he's a bit wiser then me already "Stop time nothing is so important you can't take a few moments to acknowledge the *now* take a breath with me touch peace.  Thanks mom.  Oh scratch that little spot righ...aww yeah... better..."
Hi All..**Triumph** I didn't drink last night. ...**Struggle** This has been an especially sh't week. I manage high-rise condos and 4 units flooded due to ice and burst pipes. Apparently I'm God (or a Goddess as it were) and snow ice cold and water are all withing my control. On top of that my maintenance guy has a sh't attitude this week when I need him most and I almost fired him yesterday for cursing at a colleague. This was the first time I drove home from work and regretted not being able to drink. I didn't but damn it was tempting. ...**General Chat** So I've been working on my family history and took a DNA test. By combining the results of both I've discovered that both sides of my family originated in France Normandy to be exact. That may not be a big deal to most but as any Southerner (US) will tell you their grandma was fool blooded _______(insert Native American Tribe). DNA has me at 99.8% European. Sorry mom... :) 
G-d HP whoever willing this fall I'm gonna be a coed!  I'm terrified but also so so so excited.

Triumph: New house is beautiful. Nothing fancy just in a better neighborhood and on a small lake. Beautiful low-care hardwood floors. We're renting out our old house- couldn't have dealt with all of this drunk. Never. Struggle:I'm tired a lot and overweight. Know what I have to do just gotta get motivated to do it! I was so active in my early sobriety and when I was trying to stay sober before that now I trust myself to the silence.... my activity level needs to come up. General chat: I've had the same best friend since  we were 8. She's struggling with her own drinking problem at present (WTF upstate NY? What's with all the drunks?:)). I've imparted the sobriety tools I've learned to her and I pray daily she comes out ok.   I thank God I'm sober so she can come to me if she needs me and I can shoot straight with her.  
**Triumph** 7 days of no drinking and no craving. Feeling great!..**Struggle** Headaches in the morning. I'm not drinking coffee much so I think that might be the cause...**General Chit Chat** Wondering if anyone out there has ever written song lyrics. The creative process is on my mind a lot lately. I would like to hear how others find inspiration &amp; start creating. I have a mess of words in my head that I'm going to try to form into something nice. :-) Happy Humpday everyone!!
Good morning. I'm newly sober and this is my first WuW.**Triumph:** Yesterday I had the entire house alone to myself for hours. I couldn't shake the though of drinking but I fought it hard. Forced myself to get through some tv episodes before I did anything. When I was thirsty I made myself have nasty grape soda so I wouldn't be tempted to mix it. After I just tried my darnedest to take a nap and ended up sleeping until someone else came home. Proud I managed to stay sober it would have been so easy to mess up. .**Struggles:** I can't get drinking out of my head. I'm constantly thinking about it and my craving for it is seriously bothering me. Also i had an important application rejected which was disappointing. Tomorrow is my biological mothers birthday which is always a really hard day for me. I'm hoping I'll do okay....**General Chat:** Holy Moly it's cold in Canada! Just wanna nap all day and not be outside. 
Triumph: I am sober 67 days and my mom recently had double knee replacements. I get to be a good daughter and take care of business that needs to be taken care of. I am dependable!! My mom and dad can rest easy knowing that I am accountable! It's such a great feeling..Struggle: My anxiety is causing me to not enjoy some really great parts of life because I can't stop over analyzing everything. A new relationship is budding and we are taking things SUPPPPPER slow but my general anxiety won't let me relax about it..General Chat: Life is really good now. I love that I can see a future now because I couldn't before. I couldn't see anything. I have to stay in the present and take things one day at a time. If I do that life will continue to be great!
Way to go Cakes.  You're awesome!..**Triumph**: I made it through my two weeks of from physical activity without any problems.  I know two weeks is a long time but when one exercises as much as I do more than one day off in a row is strange.  In the back of my mind I was worried I'd revert to my old ways with so much "couch time".  My first official match back was a 4.0 match (I was bumped up from a 3.5 rating last year to 4.0 this year) and I won my first 4.0 match this week.  Yay me!..**Struggle**: It's been a bit rough lately.  Communications have broken down in my marriage and my wife and I haven't been really talking (probably more accurately: listening) to each other.  But we made a huge breakthrough with our therapist this week and things are already better...**General Chat**: I can't wait for spring.  Sunny warm flowers: all good things.  Cakes can keep her bees.  I'll take outdoor tennis courts instead.
Triumph: got through a long visit with family. Only minor cravings though it was fought to watch folks get tipsy and have fun...Struggle: apparently I project grumpiness. Even when I am happy. Something I need to work on. I'm filling out a change plan to fake cheerfulness until I make cheerfulness...Chat: beautiful weather. Winter is back and looks like it will stay for a while :)
**Triumph:**  I'm sober for over a week now and have never felt better. That will always be a triumph so another one is my increased energy and productivity. ..**Struggle:** Dealing with the distance with my husband and myself. Some days we communicate as though nothing ever happened but then I see him pulling away and it deflates me a bit...**General Chat**: We had snow this morning in Dallas for the first time this winter. I am lucky to have the option to work at home and man it was gorgeous watching it come down. .
Triumph: I got to speak in front of a group of over 100 people in recovery over the weekend. I used to have terrible social anxiety to the point where the thought of public speaking would make me vomit...Struggle: There's a major winter storm headed for my neck of the woods in the deep south. I won't drink but I may lose power and get pretty cold...General Chat: I'm ready for spring!!!..
**Triumph**: I have 2. 1) 500 days sober. Wow. Didn't even realize it was coming up. 2) We finally shipped the app we've been working on to the app store. So long 90-hr work weeks for a little while (hopefully)! It's weird actually leaving when the sun is still up and having time to hang out with the family...**Struggle**: I got nothing. Things are good...**General Chat**: Haven't been on here at all lately mostly due to a complete lack of free time. Hopefully will be more now. Also come on derrick rose. wtf.
Good Morning!.Triumph: I have an important project that I've been neglecting mostly due to alcohol use and being sober has really helped me focus on what needs to get done. It feels good to not squander a good opportunity! ..Struggle: I have a good friend who is also alcoholic &amp; I'm not sure if she'll want to hang out with me sober. I doubt it. We have plans this Sunday I need to find a way to let her know ahead of time that I'll be clean and sober that it's not a temporary thing. I have a feeling she's been looking forward for me to finish with my 'sober month' so we can start drinking together again I haven't seen her all month. She will probably cancel once I tell her. I know it's not personal she has her own issues with alcohol (trying to make 'rules' herself) but I'm hoping she'll be supportive. Hoping to make a few new friends who are cool w/ sobriety &amp; reconnect with a few I already know are. ..General Chat: I just got a new phone! Mine had been slowly breaking it's so nice to have a phone that actually works the way it should.   Happy Wednesday everyone!..
I didn't want to start a new thread but my badge needs to be reset to monday 2-23-2015. I went for an assessment and will be heading to a treatment center tomorrow evening for a 21 day stay. .. I have been struggling for so long to get more than about 10 days or so sober. I'm am excited to restart my life after a long self imposed exile to my bedroom. Even while sober for over three years I didn't try to make the changes I needed to really start living. The relapse after those 3.5 years led to over 2 more years of sitting in my bedroom and drinking large quantities of vodka. Seldom if ever going out with friends and leading to rifts with some family members. The only social time I really spent was with my brother and his fiance and three kids. And even that was every other week at best... I have a lot to offer and have learned a lot about myself and even grown personally a little bit over the last 5-6 years. Now its time to put what I have learned into practice. Its time to stop trying to be what I think is cool and just be the awesome person I can and should be. for the first time in a long time I am not just thinking about the possibilities that my life holds I am not making a half hearted attempt to hold things together. I am taking the first real step towards* living* the rest of my life not just trying to get through it and exist. .. I am a survivor. When I realized a few days/ weeks ago that the part of me that just wants to fade away was getting so strong that it was starting to win I got scared. It took until I woke up on monday and couldn't remember most of the weekend (again) to realize I have finally had enough... things wont be easy for a while. treatment is going to cost me a small fortune as I dont have insurance and my state only loans you the money to help you get healthy. The thing is is that the money doesn't matter. When I am healthy I am more thann capable of making enough to live a comfortable life. I have talent that has not been fully realized and a good job with good prospects for the future. I guess all this is to say that I am greatful that this day has finally come and tomorrow starts a new chapter for me.
Hello everybody.  ..**Triumph**: I learned to dig a bit deeper and get honest with myself about what sobriety means to me.  Though this didn't lead to drinking over the weekend [I did request a badge reset](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2wvvy1/sober_sober/)...**Struggle**: Instead of a sparkling star showing 50+ days I'm back to day 3.  While clearing the air with myself and SD I'm batting back a feeling of failure and trying to silence the "you're a lost cause" voice...**General Chat**: My running was interrupted last week by a strained calf muscle -- though I've only 4 days off I missed my long run this weekend and feel squirrely without the exercise...edit: formatting
**Triumph:** I've started! The last time I didn't drink for more than 2 consecutive nights was the 3 weeks running up to England's first game in the Wold Cup last year.....I'm feeling much healthier already and I'm a lot more switched on and productive at work as a result!..**Struggle:** It's still taking me a little longer than I'd like to drop off to sleep I've found reading before bed really helps though. ..**General Chat:** I'm desperately trying to convince my boss to let me get time off to go to the F1 this summer but it's not looking hopeful :(
Good morning/afternoon.   .**Triumph**: Life is good. I am being a better person. I can see it in how I handle conflict what my priorities are and even how I speak.    .**Struggle:** I'm in a personal transition. I don't care as much as I use to about some stuff. I have been told that is BC I am being morw open minded and understanding but in the back of my head I feel wishy washy. Im pretty sure what I spend my time and energy has just shifted. They are healthy things now but all in all I am uncomfortable letting things go. In the past I would jump all over people or things and now I'm kinda like. I hope it works out I'll be here. Super uncomfortable right now.    .**General Chat:** it as -17 with a feels like temp of -47 on Monday. Keep in mind I'm from Arizona. LOL
&gt;Now that I've opened the door I want to share All The Things and tell All The Stories. People are telling me that's not a good idea.....That's interesting CoR hadn't thought about this in a while. I decided that spreading my story would just be another form of selfishness of which I already had too much. So I'm just trying to be more present and understanding and responsive to others more connected if I can. I don't need to spill my guts to do that I need to listen. Thanks for that observation. ..**Triumph:** HS Bball season ended and I made it to every one of my son's games this year. Oh and did *not* do something tempting but bad which I would have done a year ago. 'Nuff said. ..**Struggle:** Focus and discipline is flagging and I'm doing stuff that I want to do and not always the stuff I need to do. And I'm off my running program for the last few weeks--also a discipline and the source of my super powers. So time to up the game a little...**Chat:** For the last few months I've been doing some hospice with a friend who will die soon. Predictably it makes me appreciate what I have every day and minimizes the problems that are real but which won't survive me or matter and so get over it right? Right. 
Triumph: I'm back into multiple-months of sobriety. 2 months baby. Still going strong with meetings and sponsorship...Struggle: I'm in the final semester of a computer science program I have a baby girl due in the next month and I'm working full time. Keeping things balanced is difficult...Chat:  I've been trying to really work on my spirituality. For me that means more contact with my god and trying to be the best person I can be be today.
[deleted]
**Triumph**: Exceeded expectations on my review at work which means a bigger bonus and setup for a promotion. ..**Struggle**: Dad and brother want to go on a 4 day fishing trip but they will be drinking the entire time. My 6 month mark would be on the middle of the trip  I am undecided on if I am going to go...**General Chat**: I recovered my normal username here. I was posting as /u/CreamFillingWasTaken.
**Triumph**:  I'm not really tempted to drink anymore.  I did the sidebar test 2 months ago and got a low score but I decided to quit for a while because I felt like my drinking was heading in a bad direction.  I feel like I was using it as a way to deal with certain things.  I've been finding new ways to deal with problems and I think I'm making good progress so far...**Struggle**:  I'm a quiet person unless I'm drinking.  Some people take the quietness as a sign that I'm not having fun and they try to get me to drink...**General Chat**:  To expand on what I was talking about in the Triumph section:  The main thing I would deal with is frustration/anger.  I dealt with it by just being upset until enough time had passed that I didn't care about the thing anymore. Now when I'm upset I just think about what happened that made me upset if it's worth being upset about what I should do to make myself feel better and so on and I get over it really quickly...Edit:  I had an analogy in there but I took it out because it was way too long.  I didn't realise that the general chat no longer mentioned the role that alcohol had in this.  It just helped to distract me and pass time faster.  When I was drinking I couldn't really put serious thought into anything other than food or hypothetical questions..
**Triumph:** It's extremely important to me to maintain a certain depth in my life for everything to have meaning but I'm really starting to learn not to take everything so damn serious! I don't know where it came from but I feel so light. It's a new sensation. I also found a University to transfer to that would be absolutely perfect in a beautiful city. I have something to work towards...**Struggle:** This week I've been somewhat depressed and overly self critical. I think part of the blame is the winter. I lived in the sunny south for a few years and this is my first winter back in the midwest and it's really taking a toll on me. Specially since I'm walking/taking the bus everywhere. I'm trying my hardest to not beat my self up and over analyze everything all the time. I've been slacking on meetings a lot. I can tell I need to get back on my routine...**Chat:** I'm not a huge TV person. I'll watch something on netflix 2-3 times a week but that's about the extent of it until my mom got me hooked on the Real World. What are y'alls guilty pleasures?
**Triumph** 44 days sober and feelin' pretty neat about it. I also went into a record store today and resisted urges to buy an ass ton of records I usually do poorly at this...*****Struggle***** Slowly and angrily coming to terms with living with my wife's parents. It's rough not gonna lie. Their proclivities regarding dishes and cleaning the kitchen are terrible for my OCD...but they aren't charging us rent (yet) so I have to accept it. It'll happen I'm sure. At least they are snow birding to Florida for the month of March so I got that goin' for me which is nice...**Chat** I'm plowing through my second Game of Thrones book and have the third one ready to go. I also started watching 1-2 episodes of HBO's "Oz" per day I think it qualifies as decent leisure time between outpatient and going to AA...Happy WuW to the rest of you peace.
I haven't drank in like a month... And the weirdest part is that I haven't really even tried. I suppose I've been playing a TON of video games and am just waiting to hear back about my grad school app so I don't have any stresses really...But anyhow it's a bit odd and I kinda want to explore it a little and try to pinpoint why exactly it's happened like this after long struggling and how to keep it up. One thing is that I did use naltrexone for awhile with good success so maybe it's had some long-term benefit? (though I ran out more than a month ago and haven't gotten a refill yet.. and drank off of it a couple times which is stupid but oh well) 
**Triumph:** Finally starting to shed some pounds! Eating healthier and slowly starting to work out again trying to find some fun activities. I feel more openminded than in a long time. The relationship between my mom and I is getting better we can actually hang out and talk now. It's not constant fighting. We went on a little shopping spree yesterday. :).**Struggle:** Self-image. Automatic negative thoughts and behaviors around certain matters. I need to get better at working in the steps into my daily life in a better way and work on my spirituality. I need a daily reminder or otherwise I'll start to head in a completely wrong direction in my life again..**General Chat:** I'm like most of you excited about spring but at the same time I'm worried about the drinking. Summer vacations and everything. But hey now I'm fast forwarding everything again haha. One day at a time. And jeez I actually *did* survive the Christmas holidays. How bad could it be? ;) I'll just hang out here with you guys more often!
Triumph: climbed a mountain on Sunday and I'm getting into such good shape that I wasn't even sore afterwards. Also did not get post-hike beer. ..Struggle: can't stop my booze-obsessed brain from coming up with scenarios in which I could conceivably drink. ..Chat: my dog is happy but his jowls make him look frowny all the time. 
Triumph: Went to AA got a chip and finally feel like this may be going somewhere. I walked passed a bottle shop and didn't even realize I didn't want to go in until I got home. .Struggle: My life as I know it is over. I don't have any none drinking friends I don't feel comfortable telling anyone I'm quitting permanently. .General Chat: Wow mood swings galour haha.. do they settle after a while? I feel so so good in the mornings and then so bummed around 2/3 pm.
