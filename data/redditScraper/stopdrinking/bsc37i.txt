hey guys..ive posted a couple of times here and have posted when i've been not drinking for a week (seems to be the longest time i can go) but really struggling right now. in fact i started drinking today and had a dentist appnt that i cancelled (cavities) cos i was scared of it then looked up how bad it is to have alcohol with anaesthetic. but also i hate getting those gum injections and sitting through the surgery aware of everything so idk if i subconciously started drinking to have a reason to cancel...anyway that was just today i can be better. i keep telling myself that. i dont like how drinking affects me its changed from easing social anxiety to ill drink at home if i am in a bad mood. its one thing to drink to release social inhibitions but another to drink at home after a usual day at work. its another thing to start drinking at 11am before getting cavities filled that were caused by drinking alcohol all the time and going to bed all the time without brushing ur teeth cos ur too drunk to care...i feel waaay better with alcohol but my body still craves it so much. i feel guilt ashamed of myself and just horrible when i drink but i'll still do it after a week of being awesome and sober...working out and running helps me but i sprained my foot on sunday. and not having those excerise endorpins made me want other ones this week...alcoholism is one of the worst diseases out there. it's somewhat self induced so it makes u feel less confident and horrible about yourself its so celebrated every event has it (from weddings to funerals- how fcked up is that?!) and its the main way adults socialise. ..i just hate alcohol. i hate its control over me. i hate how it makes me feel. i hate how it has ruined relationships. i hate how its ruimed jobs and productivity. i hate that its killed brain cells. i hate that its so accesible. mostly i hate its control over me.

Hi friend.  I'm sorry today has been so shitty.  I am with you with the whole Alcoholism is a vicious disease.  I have a friend who says that if you can't stay sober on the street (after repeated tries) you might need to book a stay at the nearest rehab.  I never really understood because I got sober in AA and have been able to stay sober.  But I finally understood how right she was when I failed at my attempt to quit smoking -again.  So I took her advice and went to rehab to stop smoking (there is one in PA). And I was able to get the added support I needed to quit.  And stay stopped.  And while haven't beer to rehab for alcohol I have seen first hand how it can work for people.  Including my husband.  Of course this is only my experience.  Your mileage might vary. ..ps. I am not my disease... and neither are you.
