I'm in a better mood today. Last night I posted a thread (titled Anywhere But Here) where I detailed my struggles getting to Day 6. Well I'm on it now and it isn't too bad. I'm at work and feel motivated to get stuff done. Granted I'm still wanting to find another position but who knows. Maybe with time that feeling will fade too. ..I guess what I'm learning is that with recovery I have to take both good and bad. I'll have great days and then I'll have bad ones. Today is seeming to be a pretty good one compared to the bad ones that have been the last 5. ..Thank you SD for listening to me during my peaks and during my valleys.
