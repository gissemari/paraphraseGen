Long time lurker...I don't seriously try to quit drinking that often. Only when after some weeks of feelings surfacing breaching intermittently conscious thoughts start coming together. An uncomfortable feeling that drinking daily isn't a fun past time but a needed habit masquerading as choice a hobby and interest. The cheer and lack of care of my twenties following me into my thirties suddenly waking me up at 4am daily not feeling quite as good as I'd like and reminding myself that I should have a day off from beer but that thought is always forgotten as soon as work is over the trigger for my first beer of the night. You walk around and you realize - shit every fucking place is happy hour. Bar restaurant bar bar bar one after another places to go drink. I mean it's not like every second place is going to be a hammock store but it's pretty telling about how we as a society spend time...I had a great evening tonight. My partner is away. I wasn't tempted to drink. I recognized the end of work trigger managed to move past it and went out for a walk. I had dinner alone (shalimar yum) came home wrote for a little while like this and read and reflected and listened to the sounds of the city. Now I get to go to bed knowing that I can sleep through the night because there will be no hangover to wake me...I don't often try to quit drinking or even take time away nor even do I think that my relationship with drinking is massively destructive but following this group reminds me daily of my relationship with the bottle and how aware of it I need to be...Thanks all of you for sharing your struggles.

When I quit smoking I was amazed at the amount of time I suddenly found myself with. Not the same with abstaining from drinking however. Turns out I do a lot of the same stuff only sober and well-rested I am more mindful and aware of what's going on. It's also nice to not wake up at 4am with my body demanding water. I don't think I've woken up once during the night since I haven't been drinking. :)
I had a similar night last night. I got home from work and had the same trigger "must be time for a drink." Instead I drank some sparkling water and cleaned the house. I then drove out to the dog park and sat there for about half an hour enjoying the weather and talking with people. On the way home I took the long way and really took in the sunset and how happy my dog was with her head out the window. :) ..In the past I probably wouldn't have been able to drive or the couple post-work drinks would have made me too unmotivated to do anything. It's been amazing how you use and see your time when you aren't drunk. ..Thank you for sharing your struggles and your triumphs.
