I am approaching 2 months sober and realized yesterday evening that not drinking becomes easier as time goes by and not drinking becomes an automatic "habit" in itself. I hope that helps motivate whoever is struggling through the first few days and weeks...Nowadays I think about drinking less and less although still daily. I estimate it will take a few months to go to a state where alcohol is not on my mind at least once a day. It might never go away completely but I look forward to it becoming a distant memory :-)

The good news is *It can completely go away!*
I feel the same way... we are truly blessed!!! My lightbulb went off this weekend as my son got married on Saturday and I didn't drink! I did have to turn down lots of shots from my sons friends and they did give me just a little pressure but when I said no they left it at that but I was in shock that I had a Blast! I was dancing (and I dance like Elaine from Seinfeld) I was singing and socializing I did not think this was possible without liquid courage I had a way better time without alcohol!!!! I personally would never ever think that was possible but Trust me it is an AMAZING feeling!!! and incase you were wondering I was the kind of drinker that I blacked out every time I drank. This is such a gift thank you SD you guys are the Best!
This is encouraging!
