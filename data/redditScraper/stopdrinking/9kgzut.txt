Good morning all so the time has come for me to go to an AA meeting. I had a few relapses and I think it's time for me to get help. Anyway I did some research for my area and there we're a bunch of open meetings but there are a bunch of names for different meetings and I'm not sure what one to even go to. I can only go to morning meetings since I work the swing shift if that makes any difference at all.

You can go to any meeting and as many as you want to! Do you have any specific questions about meeting types? 
Congratulations on taking action for healing.  The names of the meetings are arbitrary.  There are a few different formats big book study speaker/discussion step study open discussion etc. It's all AA.  So yeah find the closest one that meets at a time that works for you and jump in.  The water's great..
