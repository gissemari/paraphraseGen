I'm 14 months sober and I've had a lot of relapse dreams. They still manage to fuck me up a little. But damn if I'm ever not so grateful in the morning when I wake up sober. ..So while I hate having them the reminder of why I'm sober and how grateful I feel in the morning to actually be sober is truly amazing.

I get these too they were really intense around the 9-10 month mark. However they are becoming less frequent now. It's bittersweet for certain. Sometimes the guilt I feel in the dream is so real! And then the relief of waking up sober and hangover-less is so good.
