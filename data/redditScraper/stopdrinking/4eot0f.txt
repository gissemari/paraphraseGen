Perhaps one day a glimmer  of light may punch a hole in your most basic assumptions. Will you break free to struggle towards the light even if it cost you your friends and family? Or stick with comfortable and familiar illusion? Truth or habit? Light or shadow? Hard choices but if it's any consolation you're not alone there are many of us down here.....Allegory of the cave...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RWOpQXTltA

Release yourself from the chains of alcohol/drugs and come out of the cave. See there is more to life than shadows on the wall!
I became so comfortable in my hole. Well comfortable isn't the right word... Resigned might be better. ..I'm glad I'm on the other side...Stay safe during detox! The wiki has some info on withdrawals and its always a good idea to see a doctor in early sobriety as they can make detox safer and more comfortable. 
just stay away from "Symposium"!
