In November I went to a local rehab facility and I was inpatient there for 28 days. I immediately began an intensive outpatient program at the same facility that meets 3 hours a day 4 days a week for a total of 26 sessions. During that time we are also required to go to 20 AA meetings. I went to my 20th meeting today and Monday will be my 26th and final session of the outpatient rehab program. If anyone is struggling with stopping drinking I encourage you to seek help as I did. I learned much from this experience and I am committed to not drink with you today.
