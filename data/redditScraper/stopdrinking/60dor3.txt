Thank you all for your honesty and openness on this site.  It has been incredibly helpful as I try to sort through my next steps (and I truly do want to be healthy and clean) I have been sober in the past (nearly 10 years from age 20-30) and then after a short stint of trying to drink again I was sober for nearly 4 years from 36 - 40.  The past few years have been incredibly difficult and now at 44 I find myself in a worse spot with my drinking than I ever was before... cravings blackouts unable to moderate effects on my marriage and other relationships etc.  I am not a huge fan of AA and this site has been very helpful to realize I am not alone and we all struggle with similar issues.  I am ready for a change - I will continue to check in and hope I can make the progress I strive for.  Thanks for listening...

From a fellow 44 year old I'm glad you're here. You're not alone! I look forward to hearing more from you. See you at check in tomorrow morning.
So glad you're here.  You can do this thing again!
I just turned 45. I spent a good thirty years drinking with some off time in there but not much. Full disclosure I drank this weekend. But I had three great months and they really showed me how much better life can be. The effort is totally worth it. The first days seemed the hardest (and I need to be vigilant again with those early days when cravings can hit) but it can get easier.
I am back to square one as well. we can do this !
