Well I got a bottle of scotch for Christmas and poured it down the sink last week  got a blow back and that taste stayed with me until Friday when I bought a bottle and downed it.  I bought another bottle but managed to stop myself after a quarter was downed.  Goodness know how I did it when I'm drunk I usually drink until I pass out or nothing is left. This morning I poured the bottle down the toilet. ..But I've found a positive I'm proud I stopped myself from continuing drinking when I was drunk I usually lose all control. ..I get it now when I'm feeling great thats when I have to be even more vigilant.

I have the same problem. I lose sight of the ball and try to reward myself with a drink. IWNDWYT 
Good job getting back to not drinking.  Do you have a plan for next time a bottle is gifted to you?  IWNDWYT
Awesome job you're doing the work!
