I've had a dreadful week. A lot of suicidal ideation and misery and guilt and shame and self-loathing all brought to a nice conclusion featuring a three day bender that I hardly remember. I didn't do much except cry to my family and sleep...Anyway my brother found out after I discussed my struggling thoughts over my rape and my suicidal thoughts. Abiut a week ago he made me promise that I wouldn't drink again. Now I've failed the only thing he talks about is how I'm a liar...Yes. I'm probably a terrific inconvenience to live with. I suffer from a host of mental illnesses as a direct result of trauma experienced two years ago which was the start of my drinking. When I'm drunk I'm miserable in the mornings. When I'm sober I'm miserable all day long and have recurring nightmares during sober sleep. I have a counsellor that I was on a waiting list for 9 months for. It's a slow and dreadful recovery. If not for my boyfriend and my parents I would definitely have killed myself about a year ago...God. How do I even live with him? He's fine! No mental health problems except a host of severe narcissistic traits which only affect the people around him not him. He has no problems. And somehow my situation and suffering have no burden on him - when I eventually admitted I'd been raped he left the house to go be angry at the park next door and has never agreed to talk about it since. Now I'm a liar and he's on the war path to make my self loathing even more overwhelming. I don't know if I can survive a sober life.

Sorry it's been so hard.  Is there anyone else you can be with right now where you'll feel more accepted? Have you tried to look for any support or recovery groups nearby?
