Relationships are better. I am getting work done and helping others. Wife is good and so are the kids. I can say that now because I spend more time with them and not how I use to. I am not always "good" but I am better than I use to be for sure. To those New Year's resolutionists; you don't have to drink today. You can do this too. 500 days from now you will be amazed that you are doing this and want nothing more than to share it with others. If you are struggling ask for help. If you need to go to meetings do that. If you need counseling pick up the phone. I started stopping long before I posted here but it didn't stick until I asked for help and became willing to receive it. Have a great day and happy new year!
