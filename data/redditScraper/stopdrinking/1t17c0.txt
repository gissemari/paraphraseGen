I turned to this subreddit when I had about 20 days and I was "in treatment." For me that meant going to a professional addiction center for therapy once a week for 12 weeks. I have since struggled with feeling sad happy angry ambivalent annoyed content happy for myself happy for others and a whole bunch of other emotions that I basically didn't really feel for 7 years. It has been a rollercoaster. My advice for anyone struggling in the first stages: ..* GET HELP. You have a disease and it won't treat itself. .2. Be kind to yourself. Take a damn bubblebath and don't go to that office party where people are drinking if you aren't ready! .3. Sobriety really is a whole life change. That can suck but it can be awesome too. .4. The earlier you quit the better. .5. Do your research read about about addiction- I highly recommend [In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts by Gabor Mate](http://www.amazon.com/Realm-Hungry-Ghosts-Encounters-Addiction/dp/155643880X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1387226445&sr=8-1&keywords=Gabor+Mate). It is excellent. ..You can do this I can do this WE CAN DO THIS!!
