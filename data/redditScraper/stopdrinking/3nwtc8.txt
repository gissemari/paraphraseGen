Just taking stock of where I am on the road to recovery...It's only been 2 weeks but who I was in the throes of being drunk and hungover seems like a world away...The temptation to relapse has been less intense than it was during the first week and I hope it gets easier from here. But I know the danger is always there...For my health my state of my mind my relationships - for how happy I want to be ultimately I have to remind myself not to give in...As always thank you all for being here. This subreddit is always a source of encouragement.
