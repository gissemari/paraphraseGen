For those that don't know me or don't remember I've been struggling with alcoholism drug addiction depression anxiety panic attacks a failing business and all sorts of other stuff over the recent and deep past...I have recently shifted into a much more positive energetic calm effective open place than just about EVER. I'm closing the business. I'm nearly done with it. I'm moving. I'm rebuilding. Things are finally clicking and feeling positive and moving forward and quickly. I was struggling for awhile as I was busting my ass but not much was changing. All of that is FINALLY gaining momentum and I'm blown away by how fast everything is going...It feels fucking great. Thanks a million to all of you. You helped me with a crucial crucial part of this. I absolutely had to remove drinking and drugs from my life to tackle everything else. You helped me do that. ..Here's to 100 days and here's to all of you!!

That's so inspiring. I'm starting to think that some of my struggles the walls that I feel I can't climb or keep running into will ease up when I get this friggin poison out of my veins for good. Thank you for sharing.

Woohoo! Congrats Sun! I'm so happy and proud for you :).
