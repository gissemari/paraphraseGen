Today is the second birthday I will have the luck to enjoy without alcohol and it's the best gift I've ever received. Last year still just a month or so into not drinking was good but tenuous. This one after more than a year without booze is much calmer and reflective. Deciding to quit alcohol is one of the best decisions I've ever made. The benefits just get more and more obvious. Hang in there if you are in your first days. It's totally worth the difficultly. And if you relapse keep trying. Thanks to all of you. Your posts and your honesty are inspiring and have helped me many many times over the last 13 months.  Have a great weekend and thank you again. .
