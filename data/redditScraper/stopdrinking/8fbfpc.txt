So I'm on day 5 and its Friday. Was having a bit of a mental struggle then I decided to look at my bank account. I have been spending on average $70 a week on beer and liquor. $280 a month!!!!! Bring on the sobriety. I'm gonna own this sobriety suit. Have a great weekend.

I was spending $200 a week   my bank account is going to be feeling a lot healthier after quitting. GO US!
For me I also saved so much by not having to miss work or replace broken phones etc.  I definitely save a nice car payment a month by not drinking!  It feels good!  
I have an app that keeps track of my days and my $$$$ saved. It is nice to see it add up.
