I've been out of town for almost two weeks for work.  I'd been a little worried that I would drink.  Old Me would have been trembling with excitement at the thought.  I haven't been tempted once.  I've just taken advantage of the time away to enjoy quiet and rest in the evening rather than slamming myself with booze every night.  This life is so much better.  If you're struggling please know that peace is out there.  Just hang on and trust.
