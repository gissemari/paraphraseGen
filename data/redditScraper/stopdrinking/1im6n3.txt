Hello /r/stopdrinking I have a bit of a confession to make. ..So I had about 6 months of sobriety until I relapsed on the Fourth of July. I had it under control I didn't do anything stupid. However this is not what the program of AA is all about. I understand that not everyone is restricted to the guidelines/stipulations of Alcoholics Anonymous and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. If you can control your drinking through other means more power to you...However the thing that has worked for me is AA...I believe in the program of rigorous honesty. I believe that this is a program of more than just abstinence from alcohol. It is a set of principles that anyone can live by to in order to repair fractured relationships and improve self-worth. I love the support that this group offers therefore I felt that I needed to come clean (literally and metaphorically) and express what I was dealing with at present. Love you all and thanks for the support..

Holidays can be rough - I remember being hungover on the 4th and drinking to make it better. I was barely able to enjoy the delicious meal and time with my family and then got home and passed out before the fireworks even started. ..What was that line from the Batman movie? ..Why do we fall? .So we can learn to pick ourselves up...I'm hoping next year will be different. Stay strong and on going!
Welcome back.   See if you can find a sober picnic for Labor Day.
