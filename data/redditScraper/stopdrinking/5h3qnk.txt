My co worker a young lady was sharing with me how her parents are going out of town for a week and she has the place to herself.  Ive noticed and shes been quite open about her drinking habits. She almost brags about her dailey drunkeness. Shes not aware of my struggles ( also I am her supervisor). Im not judging her at all!  To share with you guys my observation is maybe selfish. Her apearance is that of a hungover person. Her social life is based on drunkeness and she proudly boast of it. Like I said not judging but honestly I started where she is and landed on my ass beging for it to not be real. Plus the show. Its not all glamorous as we are out to display. I feel for her. I feel for anyone caught up in the illusion.  But guys what got me was her parents leaving her stocked up for a week of boozing. Shes my sons age. Ahhhh. I just had to share this. I couldnt at work due to not wanting to come off like a tight ass. What my sober eyes observe these days. :- ) You guys notice things like this???

.... starting to wonder reading your post about the general question: how do we help other people ? partners siblings friends coworkers.... ..what helped us? what helped you? 
I know . It might be I could help. Im 8 days so still being self contained. ? These observations may be opportunities for  sure. 
Oh my god yes. I'm shocked at how normalised excessive drinking is in some families and how it's a social/bonding thing for them...Oddly in my family my father is an alcoholic and my mother is a teetotaller. My father absolutely will not tolerate seeing me drunk and will not drink excessively in front of me (3 beers max). My mother on the other hand will happily drive me to pick up more wine or cigarettes when i'm already smashed. Go figure. They're divorced now but she was always dad's enabler.
