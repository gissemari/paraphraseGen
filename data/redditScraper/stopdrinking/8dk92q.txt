So - I had a relapse (not sure what my badge says at moment - but on day 2) - as I posted yesterday- I am all in with this sobriety thing - I went to an AA meeting tonite and was honest with  coming back  and the group was so amazingly supportive - it was a meeting where they read from a step book and were supposed to be on step 10 - but when someone is new or coming back they offer the choice to review step one - I accepted that because I clearly needed to be reminded of how alcohol makes my life unmanageable and that I am powerless over it. Anyhow - it just blows my mind how Kind most sober people are - they got their shit together and I want what they (and many of you) have!!!! Thank you sober people for that
