Hello I made this account because I don't want to be recognized if using my main account. I feel like I need to share what I'm going trough right now. I'm sorry if this ends up being very unorganized text; I don't know where to start...Lately I've been realizing that my drinking is a problem for me. I'm 28 now (male) and I work as a programmer where salary is decent. Not huge but decent. Part of me wants to think that if I wouldn't make that much money I wouldn't drink that much (because I couldn't afford it) but that's probably a lie. I've always been a drinker (since I turned 18 years old) but it was mainly going out with friends etc. Now I'm just drinking alone at home and watching Youtube until I pass out. Not every night but I would say 4 to 5 times a week. And it has been like that maybe a year now. Sometimes I've called work that I'm sick but really I've been just too wrecked to function...I have tried to stop but sometimes for example when I go to the grocery store and walk pass the liquor department I almost like automatically take a few beers with me. Then I try fight my mind not to take them but I can somehow reason to myself that it's okey. But then I realize that few beers are not enough and I should buy more because otherwise I'd have to come back later in the evening. So I end up buying so much beer that I definitely not gonna run out of it. And still I do; I just have to drink them all (if I won't pass out before)...Usually when I'm really drunk I promise to myself that tomorrow I go to talk to someone about this. But of course I won't because why would I...Yesterday (again) I went to the store buy some food and ended up having 8 (0.5l) large beer cans with me. I didn't even want them but bought them anyway. Of course I drank them all and it was around 3 am at that moment. I wanted more so I opened up a wine bottle I got from work as a Christmas gift. Drank it too. Passed out maybe at 5 am and woke up at 10 am to work. This is not what I want...I managed to stay dry the whole June and half of July though. I haven't never felt that good about myself. I did things. Went to see stuff. Talked to people. Then my summer vacation started and we went to a road drip with my girlfriend and friends. Second night I though that I can have few beers. And that's it I haven't been able to stop since that...My and my girlfriend are moving together in two weeks. I really hope that it will change things for better. My girlfriend doesn't really now how much I struggle with this. I think she only thinks I'm a so called social drinker and what not. And she nearly drinks at all so I feel extra bad that she has to be with a guy like me...I would have so much to say but I don't want to make this too long. Right now I feel like I don't want to drink ever again but I'm also feared about the fact that someday I just end up buying alcohol and then I have to drink it.

One thing a lot of us have figured out (after struggling with it for a long time) is that we can't have an occasional drink. We don't work that way not anymore and it isn't gonna change...You can do it. You can live happy without alcohol. Give that gift to yourself and to your girlfriend. No social drinking no antisocial drinking. Check in here. We won't drink with you today.
