Interview with Robin William's about his struggle with alcohol...[http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/20/robin-williams-worlds-greatest-dad-alcohol-drugs](http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/20/robin-williams-worlds-greatest-dad-alcohol-drugs)
----------immediate responses--------

I just read that whole thing I got half way through it last night before I fell asleep and I just finished the rest of it now...It's interesting because although I loved Robin Williams I had no idea he was struggling with these things and so his sudden death really was a shock and I couldn't understand it...Learning that he was an alcoholic and (former) cocaine addict kind of makes sense but the scary part is that he too attended AA meetings and rehab centres just like many of us do and that makes me a little bit fare full. I guess though everybody including celebrities each have our own demons and internal struggles that are unique to us even if they seem common to others...Thank you for posting this I don't like to engage in celebrity scandal but on this occasion it really brings it home I hope everyone out there is doing ok and I love this support network we have...Let's do this together! :-)
I think life as a celebrity would be hard though I think it's often perceived that if your a person of wealth and fame life in general is just a breeze but I don't think that's the case weather we admit it or not as people we all worry about our perceived self. We all worry about what others think of us to some degree even those that make an effort to stay true and unique and try to stand out as being genuine we still have our pride and we fear losing that pride I can't imagine what it would be like having thousands of followers or fans people taking photos of you writing articles about you it would be a very uncomfortable life
