This post is a sad counterpart to the many "nearly relapsed but managed to beat the craving in the end" stories we see so frequently on this sub. (You know the "drove to the liquor store but sat in the car for 15 minutes and finally just went back home" kind of posts.) They are always heart-warming reads and genuinely make you feel so pleased for the person in question...Well my guess is that for each of these inspiring little success stories there is (at least) **one** where the outcome is the opposite. The sad one. But we don't see posts about them. How could we - when someone caves in to a craving they're not likely to be browsing this website. And even if they were they wouldn't be able to post without violating the rules of this sub ("only post while sober")...Anyway this is what happened to me today. I had been sober for four days and fully intended to stay that way the entire weekend. Unfortunately I started to feel a craving build up a few hours ago. So I went out for a walk to distract myself. But on my way back home I was still struggling... and ended up in one of the bars in my neighborhood. I went to the counter to order a drink... but simply couldn't make up my mind what I wanted. I just stared at the drink list feeling totally confused - and also appalled by how expensive everything was. It was as if I had forgotten how much drinks cost in bars and restaurants... (I've been sober for more than a half of 2018 so far and even when I've been drinking it's been at home.) So the barmaid told me I could go sit at a table and she'd come and get my order a few minutes later. I did so. However that's when a voice in side me said "this doesn't feel right I'm not comfortable" so I got up told the barmaid I had to go. And left the bar. So now I was on my street. **Where there is a liquor store.** I felt confused... I just slowly walked up the street... then stopped... then continued walking. I finally entered the liquor store. Even in there I felt so unsure about what I wanted to do. Did I really want to buy anything? And if I did what? How much?.Well I ended up buying two bottles of my usual cheap white wine (ugh). I came straight back home and took a sip out of one of them. **A sip**. So mods: I understand if you feel that you need to remove this post but I am (still) very nearly sober. I just thought there might be people here who could relate to my experience today. That maybe someone would be interested in reading a post with **not** such a happy ending about fighting a craving...Finally to mods and everyone else: **I will not reply to any comments I might get if I drink more.** If I don't reply you will know it's because I don't want to break the forum rules...And: I'm sorry I wasn't stronger.

Do you have someone you can call?  I've been there sitting in an empty house with a (nearly) unlimited supply of booze with no real reason not to drink it.  It's not a great place to be...The best tomorrow you can have is the one with the least of that wine.  
Stopping at one sip sounds pretty damn strong from where I'm sitting! The Force of Habit can be powerful but *you* are stronger than it......Why not do yourself a favour and pour away the rest of that cheap nasty white wine? It would end up going down the loo anyway but it's so much more efficient not to filter it through your liver first......[*This Naked Mind*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4KpBxerD_BIksjUfUT4hVw/videos) helped me re-program the addicted part of my brain and deal with those intrusive thoughts of drinking when they cropped up......Hope the rest of your day goes better!..I won't drink with you today ..Woody :&gt;)&gt;.
Hey thinking of you! That's tough but I like to think of these moments as learning lessons instead of  caving.  Don't beat yourself up! ..You took a sip didn't down the two bottles. That's not a failure to me or a particularly unhappy ending. Yeah you're upset with yourself but you had the wherewithal to put that bottle down...IWNDWYT
Dang you are doing just fine.  To all fellow Sobernauts I want to say "The Force is strong in that one."  This is a process- it is like you are in school learning to be sober.  There might be other times that you do this- now you know you can be successful.
It's not too late to dump that shit out no matter how much is left.
Thank you for your honesty . ..You can still pour it out ...IWNDWYT
Well I won't drink with you.  It's up to each of us if we will make this a sober lifestyle or an alcoholic lifestyle.  We obviously root for sobriety in here the name gives it away   I would love to see you stop right there and learn a lesson *before* you drink.  It's just preferable for dealing with the addiction to learn things without consuming.  iwndwyt
