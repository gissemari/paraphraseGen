Congratulations to fellow members who've recently hit a year! It's been a while since I've checked in last and it's awesome to see posts by many of the same people who were going through the same struggles at the same time as me posting about their one year anniversaries...I'm 100% confident I wouldn't have made it a year let alone a few weeks without all of you on this subreddit...Thank you to everyone who encouraged me through some of the most difficult days of my life. I'm forever indebted to you. If we ever cross paths in person I owe you a soda/coffee/root beer/tea/your drink of choice...Cheers!

Ha!  Cool beans!  An invite to join us on /r/dinos will shortly follow if one of the other DINO mods hasn't already beat me to it.
Congratulations! I checked to see if Labor Day fell a year ago today but no it was Sept 1  2014 and that would explain the really bad weekend a year ago...maybe everyone was bummed at the end of summer.
Congratulations! 
Good job!
Congrats on 365!
