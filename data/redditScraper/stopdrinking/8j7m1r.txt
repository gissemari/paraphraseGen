Just checking in to write that another week down this is number nine. I've got 63 days under my belt and looking for the 10th week down in a week from now. I'm not to worried about the weekdays since I'll be working all week and don't want to even drink now Durning the week. It's more of a struggle still with weekends that's when I still feel like having a drink this weekend was really tempting but I kept strong and didn't give in. With that said if this chronic alcholic can go a few months so can you. It can be done your body will thank you for keeping that poison out. I will not drink with you today.

Well done for keeping strong this weekend...You've got week 10 in the bag!..IWNDWYT 
Yeah it should be easier then this last weekend. We stayed low so it was kinda boring so I just was kinda in my head every here and there but this weekend coming up is my wife's birthday so we have a packed weekend. It's that downtime that can get me in trouble and I'm still getting used to being comfortable with it. normally I would have been blacked out all weekend if there was nothing to do and would be regretting it as I'm getting ready for work but no hangover to fight off tonight so it was a good weekend.
