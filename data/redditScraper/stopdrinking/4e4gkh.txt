Welp I made it 60 days!  This is the longest I've been sober in over 10 years.  I feel the best I have now for as long as I remember.  I can remember dreams at night don't have to worry about being pulled over for fear of *another* DWI.  ..By far the biggest change I have seen is in the improvement of my health.  ..**NOTE-** My original sobriety date was 12/18/2015 I put together about 45 days then had a 5-7 day relapse.  My new sobriety date is 2/9/2016.  So I've actually had over 100 days sober since my original sobriety date- just not continuous sobriety...**As of January 12 2016:**..My Liver test results were:. .AST: 274 (0-40 normal)..ALT: 182 (0-44 normal)..Possibility of Hepatitis B&C..My blood pressure was:..185/120 (normal is below 120/80)....**As of April 4 2016:**..AST: 33 (0-40 normal)..ALT: 32 (0-44 normal)..Hepatitis B&C tests were negative..My blood pressure was:..120/84 (normal is below 120/80)..I need to start mixing in some exercise to get the blood pressure down a little more but overall I feel great.  I've been going to AA and working with a sponsor.  I just finished step 3 working on 4.  AA and SD have been a great support system for me I look forward to many more sober mornings to come...Cheers- I will not drink with you today!  [**My chip**](http://i.imgur.com/vBSEkTS.jpg?1)..

That's awesome. Lots of time sobriety benefits are kinda abstract but good numbers on a health chart...can't argue there.
That's great to see congrats on 60 days sober! ..My health damage and risks were a strong motivation for stopping drinking for me. For exercise I started off with walsk and after a few months sober I built up slowly to regular more vigorous exercise.
