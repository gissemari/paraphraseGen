This morning someone posted their recent moderation experiment and its outcome (thank You!). Many of us have done such experiments...Can we somehow generate data? ..What if we could answer this question with numbers:.."what is the probability of successful moderation? 10%? 1%? ".........................Why should we care?..Many of us have done experiments with moderation. You probably have done at least one. Every day somebody posts here about their mostly failed attempts. Why are we doing this? How much does it cost us?..Reading here it is clear that each of us thinks maybe I can moderate. ......................... ..I know there are a lot lot lot of issues with this .- we don't want to encourage anyone to try to moderate for an experiment .- surveys and questionnaires can be biased by e.g. memory (I don't remember whether my last moderation experiment lasted 2 months or 4 months). .- if we create a survey the people who choose to participate will be a biased sample (maybe only those who relapse will seek the survey out).- we all start from different places. Maybe if you drank only x units a day your chances of moderation are 5% but if you drank 2x units a day your chances go down to 1%.- maybe this study exists. If so then what is the answer?........................
