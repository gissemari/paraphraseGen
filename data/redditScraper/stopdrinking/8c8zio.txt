I ended up in the hospital due to complications with the medications I take for bipolar disorder mixed with alcohol. I was trying to self medicate but I ended up so angry and manic that I became suicidal and ended up in a hospital. Since I was released I am trying again to be sober. I've been okay so far the hospital gave me some meds to help my cravings. ..However part of me keeps trying to convince the other part that I can totally drink in moderation but I know that that's just not possible. That part also tries to convince me that I'm missing out by not drinking. I know I'm not and I can actually make the most out of life now that I'm sober. I just feel kind of left out because my friends (there's like 2) keep going out to places where they're drinking and I can't go. I could but I think I'd be too tempted...I'm really alone right now and that makes not drinking really hard. I've passed a few bars while driving and really felt like pulling in. I don't know why I want to drink I HATE myself when I'm drinking...I'm just looking for some support and wondering how to stay sober but also be social. My friends are pretty much ignoring me and I'm completely alone right now. I'm really worried I'm going to spiral into depression and start drinking again!

I think on this one I'd have to face the fact that I AM missing out right now. I mean let's not lie--your friends get to go out and you have to stay home because let's be honest you'll drink if you go out. You *can't* be social and do what you need to do. And it sucks...So I'd have to fully face it because otherwise I'm going to continue worrying the issue feeling the pull trying to figure out this unsolvable equation stuck between two places. I'd rather just *feel a way* and get on with it you know?..So let's face it: you're missing out. You can't go out. Because you can't drink. You have to heal. It sucks. But at least we know what we're working with now. Can't get any worse! And at least you're not drinking. That's one thing that's going right. ..And as it happens it's the only only only thing that needs to go right at the moment. It will allow all the other things to go right. They will work themselves out. Today you are doing everything you need to do and you're on the right path. You are.
AA meetings were a safe place where I found people who understood. They gave me hope and guidance. I made a lot of new sober friends too. Going it alone is lonely and not working so well for you. ..I stayed away from bars and people who abused alcohol. That's why going to AA meetings was so important to me. I learned a whole new way of life.
