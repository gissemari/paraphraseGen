I slipped I binged hard for a few days. I'm out of it now but having withdrawals. Feeling sick slightly dizzy shaking can't sleep and I've never felt worse....I've been trying to manage and hiding it from my girlfriend. She knows I drink a bit but she has no idea how much. I'm so ashamed I don't know how to tell her how I'm struggling but I just feel like she needs to know and I need her support.

You will feel better tomorrow. Hang in there. ..Close relationships include sharing. The good and the not so good parts of our lives. ..Slips happen but iwndwyt.
She deserves to know. Have an calm honest real discussion. I will not drink with you today.
You will feel so much better to share. Secrecy makes our problem so much worse. WD's are horrible and I get them from 1 night of drinking now! Kindling is real. Sending you best wishes for healing and no more suffering from the evil poison. IWNDWYT
Please talk to her. I can't tell you how freeing and comforting it is to be able to share it with a loved one. Give her the benefit of the doubt that she will be glad you shared with her.
