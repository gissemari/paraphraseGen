I was seated across from a lady on the light rail as we headed through midtown Phoenix. We hadn't spoken to each other the short trip and after a couple of stops she stood to get off but before she did she leaned down put her hand on my shoulder and said this: :"beauty is in the eye of the beholder. If anyone looked behind your shell they would see how beautiful you are. Keep your head up.".I thanked her and sat there stunned for the remainder of my trip. The fact that she reached out to a stranger to give them a message full of such heartfelt sentiment truly touched me. If anyone gets a chance reach out if you feel moved to do so. It may well be the action that  helps a struggling alcoholic go to a meeting instead of buying that fifth. I had been questioning my own sobriety today and while I don't think I was in danger of pucking up I can't say I wouldn't have tonight. That said I will not drink with you all tonight

What a beautiful random act of kindness.  She must have seen something special in you.  Proud to drink with you tonight.
Wonderful story! 
I just have a visual of this lady roaming around Phoenix doing that kind of stuff wherever she wanders in her life...How cool...I wish I was that lady instead of Mister Wreckage...I love that she saw you (saw you) and connected with you.
