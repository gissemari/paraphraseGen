First time posting here. I'm on vacation at the beach and went on a first date with a girl last night and made the plans to get ice cream and go swimming. All that was fine but she suggested we go to a bar afterwards. Basically I said full disclosure that I quit drinking and I'm not trying to drink at all but that I didn't mind going as long as she was cool with me not drinking. She couldn't comprehend how I couldn't just have a couple drinks and kept pushing me to "have one". When we got there I just got a soda water with lime and just told her it was a vodka soda. We danced and had fun but none of it had to do with alcohol and at the end of the night she said "I'm proud of you for having drinks". It was bitter sweet because I stuck to my guns and didn't drink but I still wasn't honest with her and it's frustrating how people my age ( I'm 23) think alcohol is essential to having fun. This was the closest I was to relapsing just so I would appear "normal" in front of someone of the opposite sex. Anyways i just wanted to rant and I won't drink with any of you today.
