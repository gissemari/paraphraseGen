I'm pretty down. I'm so mad at myself that I allowed my anxiety to get to me to the point where I felt I needed to drink to just calm it down and the drown the thoughts going through my head. I feel like utter shit. I didn't sleep all night and I was up until 5AM. I ended up drinking a pretty decent amount of alcohol. ..But I've been puking all morning to the point where this is absolutely nothing else to get out besides bile. I'm shivering cold and my head hurts. I feel the regret also. I just hate how I've lied to myself and I've lied to my boyfriend. I feel like I've let him down even though he doesn't even know that I drank last night and that's what hurts me the most and makes me feel super guilty. Should I tell him that i had a slip? I feel so worthless and useless and I just hate feeling like I'm letting everyone around me down. ..I let my anxiety win and had drinks and filled the void temporarily to pass the time and relieve my anxieties about things going on in my life but now this morning I'm just more anxious upset and depressed because of my choices. ..I didn't do anything necessarily stupid last night. Just drank and played video games and stayed up till 5am but I still just feel so defeated and upset feeling like I've let people down around me.

Brush off your guilt and get back on the horse. Know that this group understands your thought process and will help you with recovery. I will not drink with you today. 
I like to be honest with those closest to me personally. It keeps the trust between us strong.
