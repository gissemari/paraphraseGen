'Sup SD!?..Here we are. 100 days. Triple digits. The last time I went this long without alcohol was more than half my life ago...I posted at 90 days so I'll keep this brief. (Hint: I never keep it brief). This is for those in the very very early days who are just coming into sobriety. I'm not an expert I don't have all the answers my life isn't perfect and I'm not perfect. But here's what worked for me:..- Accepting suffering. Letting it break me down into little bits. Not just at the start but right through. Avoiding it makes it worse and scarier. **Acceptance makes it manageable. Manageable is doable. Doable gets done.** (I am talking about emotional pain/difficult feelings. Alcohol stuffed these down into me and they had to start coming out when I stopped dulling them with booze. I am not talking about physical withdrawals - from what I hear on here physical withdrawals are no joke and you should see a doctor if need be)...- **One. Day. At. A. Time.** I try very hard not to think about the future. I try hard to focus my attention closer and closer to **right now**...- If u/coolcrosby says it I try to do it: **Dry people dry places.** I can't always get away from boozed environments but my cravings definitely need a little talking to before I walk in the door. ..- Feel bored? Then feel bored. Feel sad? Then let yourself feel sad and cry if need be. I'm a grown man and crying still cleans me out like I was a five-month old...- I hung out heaps on SD. **All the time.** I have the reddit app on my phone and deleted all my other subscriptions. When in need I open the up and get straight-up unadulterated SD goodness.  ..Am I worried about relapsing? Yeah I am. Like I said I'm not an expert at this stuff and I really don't want to get cocky. But perhaps like many things the best way to approach this sobriety thing is with a beginner's mind - trying to accept that I know nothing that every day is an opportunity to learn more. And to learn more I come to you people every day...As always I wish each an every one of you a day and night filled with peace and healing calm and quiet silence and joy. May you all find your peace. ..Oh yeah shout outs to u/Lee_in_NY (your positivity and kindness inspire us all!) u/Prevenient_grace (thanks for so many on point comments) and u/probably_cancer (let's keep on keeping on :)..EDIT: Of course thankyou to our amazing brilliant and all-round excellent moderators! As well as everyone who posts comments shares reads lurks ponders thinks soothes wonders hopes and is well just great.
