..come on over! Couldn't resist the silly pun. ..This will be the first year I'll be heading into my end-of-October birthday SOBER. I cannot express how much that means to me after 30+ years of struggle. Something seems to have miraculously clicked in my brain and I seemingly have finally found a new pathway in life that does not involve alcohol - and this subreddit is part of it.

I have an October birthday too! Looking forward to not drinking with you!
