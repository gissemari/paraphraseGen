I haven't posted much in the last week or so...but have still been checking this sub every day pulling support from you guys.  I'm amazed at how a little honest acceptance makes such a huge difference.  I sit alone in my house my wife and child away for the week. In the past I would have taken this opportunity to by the highest % malt liquor i could find and binge....but not now....I posted a few weeks a statement I heard on a podcast that resonated with me about my own alcoholism...."It's not what I wanted...but it's what i got".  I've been down the relapse road too many times....it starts innocently enough "sure...it's just one drink..i can drink like everyone else"  Bullshit...i don't want one drink...i don't want 2...i want 9...i want to get drunk!  It's the truth....It's what i was dealt..so we "deal".....I do love waking up without a dehydrated headache....Sorry for the random-ness...just wanted to check in. Love you guys..Namaste

Glad to hear from you again /u/rsnblues77 -- have you ever checked out the IRC link?  Over there----------------&gt;  Might be worth looking at.
&gt;"It's not what I wanted...but it's what i got"...Someone posted here once and what they said still resonates with me all the time. .."Play stupid games. Win stupid prizes."..I think about that all the time. ..Stay good keep coming back to read. 
Well done on the 30 days. You're doing remarkably well in an empty house resisting that temptation. ..Sometimes it occurs to me maybe it'll be different now I can control this now. If you get those thoughts don't be fooled! I can never drink again and that's that I'm not missing anything but pain and heartache.
