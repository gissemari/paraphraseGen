Hey there stop drinking..So today I had a relapse. it wasn't bad I had a few beers watching movies. It was even approved by my wife. But.....I guess I've never been an alcoholic but I have had several binge drinking episodes. I haven't been nearly as far as some of the stories I've read here but...  there have been times where I started feeling like it could become a much bigger problem. ..You start rationalizing you start thinking things are more exciting drinking you start thinking you might be more exciting drinking.....but... it's not worth it in the end. I've sobered up now and I regret my decision. It didn't make my movie any better it probably won't feel any better later. So I won't drink with you today or the next day. Hopefully not next week or the week after...

It's a good idea for all people to really think about our drinking levels and whether we overuse or drink to forget or act irresponsibly or live in a haze or harm ourselves... .it's good you're doing your own personal review and taking stock in an honest way about alcohol and it's role.  Good stuff.  It's not a great place to descend to misuse abuse and harm kudos for taking preemptive action! 
Hi Caphall! It wasn't worth it in the end for me either. And boy did I ever rock that End. Wish I had your insight sooner than I did...I will not drink with y'all today.   within
