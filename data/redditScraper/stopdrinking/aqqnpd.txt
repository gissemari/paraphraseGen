I saw this quote on Instagram today and boom it really resonated. I relapsed for three stupid days about a year ago and can't remember my exact new sobriety date but it's right around this time. I was going to make it March 1 because that's easy to remember. But after seeing this quote I decided to make my new forever sobriety date Valentine's Day. I want a special day to celebrate my radical act of self love sobriety. Please love yourselves first today and then everyone else. Peace out sober friends you inspire me every day thank you.

I love this! Thank you for sharing. 
Nothing better.   ..And I've heard alcoholism called slow motion suicide.
&gt;**radical acts of self love**..Not sure what that really means.
Wow my wife just showed me that on Instagram. I love it!
Good date to use. Please post 'year 2' next V day. Congrats.
Peace to you!
 
  
Thank you. Love this. 
Oh I like you!
This is cool now I can have a celebratory anniversary with myself once every month! I didn't think of that!
Very nice! 
Congrats...IWNDWYT
 
You're right. I've been so focused on another person in particular and what went wrong with that situation but I need to forgive myself and move forward. And love myself and the progress I've made.
Wow! This is wonderful.  .Glad you're here happy 365+ days :)
There is so much truth here.  It's terrible how many alcoholics are self loathing.  I've seen how it creates a vicious cycle of destruction.  Thank you so much for sharing this.  IWNDWYT 
Congratulations on your sober trip around the sun!
