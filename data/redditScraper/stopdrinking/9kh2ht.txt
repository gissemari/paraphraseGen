I have struggled with drinking for about 15 years. I do not drink daily. But when i have one i have to have 20. I have made a fool of myself on more that one occasion. I have so badly hurt the people i love most. When im sober im actually a good person. I care deeply abput those around me and strive to succeed in all adpects of my life. One damn sip though and its like i turn into this party animal with no caution to my actions. I dont care what i do or say. Who i hurt. Until i wake up the next morning. I am usually so riddled with guily that i am physically sick to my stomach. I beat myself up for days on end swearing to myself that i will never do it again. I often wonder how my husband could possibly love someone like me. I am truely not worthy of him when im drinking. How many more times will he accept my appology before he has had enough? How do you make ammends with the people you love. How do you forgive yourself so that you arent in a constant vicious cycle of hating yourself for how you acted while drunk. I need to learn to love myself again so that i can be someone who is worthy of being loved. I dont know how to let go of my past and all of the countless bad decisions i have made. And it is taking its tole on me.

Hey Butterfly good to see ya :)...I felt the same way. Unworthy of love...I knew that in order to get my life back together and make amends I had to put in the work and *demonstrate in my actions* my commitment to sobriety first...People didn't want to hear my apologies anymore. They wanted nothing to do with me and I lost a lot of friends...I went to detox and then worked my program - and I continue to work my program every single day so that I don't get complacent. ..Here's a link to the [Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which I found extremely helpful...There's a quote that I learned for a dear Dinosaur here:..**"Let us love you until you can love yourself"**...We get it. We're in the same boat. And we have your back ;)..
I need to figure this out too.
Hey friend I sure do know this game. Guilt is a very powerful chain that keeps us tethered -- it can feel so overwhelming to want oblivion. But when you think of it you can see how nuts it is to use drinking to get over how bad you feel about your drinking behavior. I particularly like the idea that your Addictive Voice (or Beast or Inner Addict or disease whatever you want to call it) is a crafty sumbitch who will turn anything and everything to the goal of sustaining the booze flow. When you have guilt thoughts plus drinking thoughts that means your Beast is under siege starved out scared. Making amends plus remaining sober is the most powerful weapon you got. ..The hard thing about guilt gets to the division within us. It's important simultaneously to remember that our booze selves both *are* and *aren't* our real selves. Are -- because you gotta own the behavior that comes out of your mind and body -- it's not anyone else's behavior after all. Are not -- because we have made the conscious choice to repudiate that past behavior and scramble for the light. That means that we are editing ourselves into the sort of people who would never behave as we did in the past. While redemption and sobriety can't wipe out the bad staying on the path of the beam is a way of announcing to ourselves and the world that we want to be good and kind and helpful and effective. The guilt is information that you want to be good and a stimulus that can drive you that way if you read it right. ..You got this. I remember how sick and scared and bad I felt a couple days in. I have a long memory for shame and it still jumps out at me from the dark corners. But I got off the sauce precisely because I didn't want to be that guy anymore. Sounds like you've made that same good choice and I have full confidence you can stick it. ..Learning to love yourself doesn't mean your past behavior is rad or anything. It means believing that you have resources and virtues which you were keeping submerged and can now bring into service. So have some candy and some coffee and some sparkling water tell the folks you love that you love them binge on Netflix or read a book or clean the house write about your feelings and reflect on your good decision to reform. I believe in you. I will not drink with you today.
