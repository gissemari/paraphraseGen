Day 5 for me.  I have relapsed probably close to 100 times.  A few months ago I had 9 days of sobriety and then drank heavily and heartily.  Reset my badge probably 10 times since then...This is the quit that's 'different' though.  I get the cravings but I don't miss the booze.  It's interesting to hold both of those views at once.  This is the quit where I'm sure I'm done.  There's no ambiguity haunting me...I am beginning to experience the emotional roller coaster of getting sober...becoming clean.  When I drink my emotions hit me like 20ft waves.  They knock me down roll me on the bottom and leave me gasping for air.  Now today there's a little clarity between my ears.  I am experiencing the waves of emotion but I can now see them rising up allowing me to prepare to ride them out and watch them dissipate with me still standing.  I'm becoming a huge fan of being more aware.  ..If you are reading this I hope all is well.  On this day I will not drink with you.  Take care.

Good luck friend! Your comments about your emotions resonated with me. When I was quitting booze I realized my ego has only one way to deal with uncomfortable emotions - escape them. In reality the only way to deal with fear worry regret or whatever is just to hold on and feel them letting your higher self or God or whatever deal with them. But the curative miracle cannot happen if I let my ego try and fail to resolve them...I will not drink with you either.
We're in the same lifeboat together! After drinking 12 beers a night for 6+ years I quit a few weeks ago and got to 9 days before falling. I went kind of crazy over a long Independence Day vacation but it made it very clear that I can't handle any booze. Here I am about to click 6 days and couldn't be happier. Keep it up! IWNDWYT
