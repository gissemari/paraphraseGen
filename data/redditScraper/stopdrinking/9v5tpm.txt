My drinking has 100% been a coping mechanism for clinical depression that for over a decade now has not responded to medication or treatment. Even after being hospitalized two years ago after a suicide attempt. Is there such thing as a  normal   happy  person developing alcoholism? I.e. one without a mental illness. ..I know this question might seem irrelevant but sometimes I really struggle to separate the substance from the mental illness that drives it. I feel like I have two choices: drink or be sober enough to successfully kill myself.

Yea I know happy drunks. I work with some. They laugh and joke all day and then go home and drink a 12 pack every night. If they're depressed at all they're hiding it really well. 
I was always a happy drunk and i actually never drank if i was down upset or mad.
Most research suggests that anyone can become alcohol dependent with sufficient administration. 
From one person with clinical depression to another I thought the same way as you. If drinking was the only thing that made me happy and I had no choice but to quit drinking then what was the point of living? ..Thank god I was able to turn that logic around. I decided I would try absolutely anything that might make me feel better since the alternative was literally death. I was ready to try ketamine TMS even ECT. My doctor took me really seriously. It's going to be a long road but I have hope for the first time in a long time...Have you read Andrew Solomon's "The Noonday Demon"? It's the most comprehensive and realistic book on depression I've ever read and he discusses people who struggle with severe treatment-resistant depression. He says that depression is only bearable when you have hope that it will end. I think there is still lots of hope for you.
