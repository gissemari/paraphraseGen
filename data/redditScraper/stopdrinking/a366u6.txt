High five to you on the big 100. Feels good doesn't it?
Welcome to triple digits!..I'm a big fan of the palindrome badges too... your '101' tomorrow is a much-coveted and elusive rarity: the *strobogrammatic* palindrome which reads the same forwards backwards and upside-down!!..Enjoy!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
You're doing brilliantly  . Any lessons learned that you care to share?
Glad that Woody pointed out your rare Palindrome...In ten days after you have the exceedingly rare ..Three Digit Homogenous Strobogrammatic Palindrome!..Woo Hoo!..I mean...  really *exciting*!  Right!?
