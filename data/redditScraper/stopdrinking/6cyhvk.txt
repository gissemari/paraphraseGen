(23M)My ex thinks (21F)the whole reason I drank was because I wasn't happy in the relationship I think she was trying to say "it's not you it's me". ..Day four sober my anxiety is at bay my confidence is back. I'm ready for the long haul of sobriety. We broke up little over a month ago and I went on a bender with the whole liter and 12 back a day even shagged up with a hooker for a couple nights to get over her. I relapsed back in December. Drinking a couple times a month but drinking is different than getting drunk I guess. Just want to come clean to somebody. Please share with any insight. call me whatever I'm sure my mothers called me worse xD
