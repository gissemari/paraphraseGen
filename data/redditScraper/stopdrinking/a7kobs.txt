What a week what a month!..I have 4 1/2 months sober time now back on the program after messing with the disease on and off for a couple of years...Before that i had 1 1/2 years and the time before that one 2 years: im a serial relapser...Lately work has been progressing well but i feel tired all the time i am very confused and i feel like im not doing well enough i am terrified of drinking again...I call my sponsor every couple of days from aa and i hit meetings every other day...I try to pray at least once a day for sobriety and to thank god that my life isnt in the state it was 4 1/2 months ago...My girl is happier i bought her a diamond ring with my drinking money im not seeing call girls anymore or strippers...Im left with crushing guilt about the man i became while obsessing over the drink the edge has worn off now and i try to take it one day at a time at least im not making things worse today...I have a credit card to pay off from all my parties too im 3 grand in out of ten just from these last few months but i wanted a house by now (im 23)..I started a business with my boss and my friend and we think things will go great in this new year (just incorporating and sorting out licensing requirements now)..I take my bipolar meds every morning and night as my doctor has advised for me they help level me out...I have wanted to drink here and there over the last few months but instead i pray and i sleep and i work. Im tired and im afraid of my responsibilities and of how i know i can act when i am actively drinking i question if i can bear the difficulties of life...But i am going to my home group tonight and im going to finish my step 4 work after the meeting pick up my lady from work after that...I have holidays for 2 weeks starting friday and i am looking forward to the beach...My finances are okay my head is okay im not sick and i dont want to die...Thank you very much to all of you who post on here i read these posts quite often as a way to remind myself of the horrors of my addiction while im at work so i feel good about walking a better path...Ill post again sometime soon :)

It sounds like you are doing really well. With 4.5 months and working the steps you have a lot to offer the newcomer I find that reaching out to others gets me a lot of freedom from self.
