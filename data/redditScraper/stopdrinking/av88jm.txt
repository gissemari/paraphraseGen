Really craving some relief 
----------immediate responses--------

Me too. Dont do it
A drink will only provide a temporary illusion of relief (which I'm sure you know given that you're posting here). Is there something you can do to relax or distract yourself? IWNDWYT 
I ate junk food early on. A lot of it.
Cannabis! It helped me get off the booze and also helped me quit cigarettes.
