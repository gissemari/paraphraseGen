Hi there been awhile since I have posted but I have been reading alot of inspiring post of success and struggles with addiction here lately .. I've just turned 34 this month and I told myself it was time to change my ways to stop spending all my money on alcahol and 3 day benders.. that did not last long I have struggled with alcaholism my whole adult life lost jobs ruined relationships friendships ect I'm sure everyone know the outcome. This past weekend I chose to get wasted not go to work end up going to a festival on sat making I rational desicision took some mama ended up in the hospital missed work the next day. I feel guilty ashamed and stupid for spending so much money that I can't afford. But with that being said I feel like I have a second chance I just have to stay positive I have been down this road before the thing scares me is I always end up drunk spending money getting into shit and feeling guilty and ashamed afterwards I know I need support so I will be checking in daily looking into AA again but this time I will be talking to my doctor about options I work in hospitality my roommate is a heavy drinking but says he wants to support  my decision  he has said it before but the cycle repeats itself I feel like I'm running out of time not to mention what I have done to my body thanks for listening I will not drink today or tonight I'm going to set up to do some volunteer work for a chefs accosiation  sober thanks all have a great day

I hear you.  I won't drink with you today.   I found this place to have so much love support and wisdom.  I check in here every day and pledge to not drink.   I am a person who really prides myself on keeping my word so that has really been a helpful strategy for me.
Talking to your doctor sounds like a great idea.  Hang in there!
