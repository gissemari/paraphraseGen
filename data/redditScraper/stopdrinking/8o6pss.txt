I didn't plan this well but I decided to stop drinking about four or five days ago. Tonight I drank. More than I normally used to. To be completely honest I'm drunk and pretty angry at myself. I don't know why I'm writing this but maybe I'll see it tomorrow and get back to why it was important to me. I don't want this life anymore I don't want to hide my feelings behind alcohol. So when I wake up day 1 starts again. And this time it will stick.

I like the saying "When we're drinking we're wishing that we're not and when we're not drinking we wish we we're." Definition of insanity. ..Even though I appreciate you posting the guidelines say only post here when you're sober. ..Good luck for tomorrow!
We have to remove this as you've been drinking tonight.
