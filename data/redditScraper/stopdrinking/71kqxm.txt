What lead to this latest relapse?..For almost two years I used to relapse every few weeks just like it sounds you're doing. I would convince myself that if I just did this thing or that I could drink without consequence. It would always lead to disaster. ..I eventually had a long talk with the person who was my sponsor and had to conclude that I was indeed alcoholic and that there was no scheme that would allow me to drink like a normal person. For whatever reason that stuck with me and 1070 days later here I am...Keep trying. Just because you've slipped up one time or twenty times doesn't mean this time can't stick. I am living proof of that.
It's all about fighting that first drink. Here is what I have done since I relapsed: played the tape though and tried to feel the guilt and shame called someone when I wanted to have a drink avoided situations with a ton of alcohol. You're getting more experience with trying to quit. It's all about avoiding that first drink
When you've gone to meetings in the past have you made connections will people and gotten their phone numbers? This really helped me get out of the relapse cycle and stay sober. ..Relapse really sucks man. But you can get out of it!
