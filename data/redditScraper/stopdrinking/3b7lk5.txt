Good morning everyone! Its a great day to be sober. I went to a meeting last night and it was quite the experience...When I walked up to the entrance I found a man smoking a cigarette. I asked if he was going into the meeting. He ashed his smoke and showed me the way inside. There were 5 people sitting in chairs in the basement meeting room. I introduced myself shook some hands and next thing I knew it was story time...WOW! I was so surprised at how much passion and heart wrenching detail was packed into that 60 minute time span. Each member spoke directly to me maintaining eye contact with me. They were not downtrodden or cynical as I had somewhat expected coming in but passionate and tactful with their stories...The first woman had told me her past of working at the family owned bar and how she had eventually resorted to using hard drugs in order to stave off blackout from extended alcohol binges. She had lost her business her home and her husband all within three years. She had reached the brink when she found herself picking up the bottle of vodka while her newborn child crying in the room next to her. As a single tear rolled down her face and her looking directly into my eyes she told me of how that moment was her conscious decision to stop. She told me of how from that point on she crossed a line that would never be able to be uncrossed. Something in her just simply had enough. She made a conscious decision to stop participating in the same addictive behaviors while simultaneously expecting different results. She sought out sober people and engaged. No one was going to hold her hand for her in her personal fight against her struggles. It was up to her and only her. She frequented AA meetings and began to look inwardly about how she had got herself into such a horrible position in life. It was not the alcohol itself that was to blame but her poor decisions in regards to it. I felt like it justifying alcohol abuse can only go so far until people reach a breaking point and she had found hers. She made poor decisions while drinking and was in a deadly cycle. She stopped making excuses of why things were bad. She stopped cursing the world and crying out as a victim that the odds are stacked against her. Instead of talking she took action and allowed herself to be exposed to others. She let other sober people into her life and decided to drop her pride at the door and participate. She has been sober since 1993...The next man was a younger professional who looked like he got out of a law firm. Very nice hair cut and trimmed beard. We were sitting in a circle and he also looked directly at me as he told his story. It was a tale of how alcohol can skew your perspective into rationalizing while allowing negative things to continue to happen...His first drink was with a jock in high school somewhat of a role model at the time. He picked up the alcohol to get women and be cool like his athletic friend. He said it was the elixir that allowed him to be everything he was not. He loved the feeling of confidence and invincibility that it provided him. He felt like everything was going so well since he now had the social prowess to get girls in high school. Yet at the same time he was slipping. He gotten caught being drunk in class so he was in the intervention class. In his monologue he recalled the subject of alcoholism being brought up in that mandatory class and him asking himself if that was a being an alcoholic was a possibility for him if he was not careful. He shrugged it off and his slide continued with time. ..He told himself he wouldn't get a DUI. He did. He told himself he wouldn't allow himself to be admitted to an inpatient treatment center by court-order. He did. He told himself he would never get locked up. He did. Once he got out of jail the first time he immediately drove to Denver to drink and go "die in a dark alley somewhere" ..He said he was thankfully arrested after some time in Denver and continued to use alcohol and drugs while in prison. One day while he was snorting off of a mirror in his cell he saw his reflection and something in him clicked. His life could only go up from there. He began to go to prison AA meetings. To me the story and the person just didn't match up. I had to keep the expression on my face from displaying complete awe. This guy must have really turned his life around. He started WORKING toward his sobriety and his low and behold his life got better. It took time and it took effort but slowly it got better. ..He said his secret was taking everything one step at a time. He told me that in this path of sobriety there will be stumbles and falls but the only way to keep going is to recognize how you tripped and allow yourself to learn. Honestly assess how it can be done different the next time make a plan and try and stick to that plan...For me I learned to lose my false sense of self-entitlement while I was serving time and doing an outpatient program. I learned that I am no exception to the rule if I drink and do illegal things then I will be prosecuted just like everyone else. I am now off probation and have been sober intermittently. I have gotten to 90 days 14 days and it is still a learning experience for me. After the meeting was over I exchanged phone numbers with some folks and will hopefully be continuing down the right path. I remember how sobriety allowed me to fully feel things. To get real belly laughs that could never be accomplished in a dark bar. There are to many great things in this world that can be missed if I am drinking. ..Here is to not drinking today SD we are in this together. ...

congratulations welcome to the strange yet comfortable alternate universe they call AA
Each of the stories you told had a 'moment of clarity' in them.  A mother realizing she was choosing vodka over her child a young professional seeing his reflection in a jailhouse mirror...Mine was equally well defined - coming out of a blackout on my front porch realizing that I had a loaded shotgun inside and was drinking to summon up the courage to pull the trigger on myself...Ask yourself what your 'moment of clarity' was - the moment when you realized exactly where the drink had taken you and the decision to do something about it.  Was it when you were serving time?..Thanks for posting.
