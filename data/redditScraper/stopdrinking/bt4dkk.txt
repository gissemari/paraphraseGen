There is no right or wrong in life.  Just results we get to live with.  I will suppose it depends what kind of results we're looking for that shows if something is right for our goals or the wrong way to achieve them
Not sure either..need to dig deeper...know it is not about the alcohol for me..it is is about my loneliness..and not wanting to come home to an empty house....
It's totally okay. If you go another 12 days without drinking you only drank once throughout a month. Coming from someone who drank everyday that's a huge difference. It's only bad if you end up in the same cycle of drinking almost every day again.
Haha that's a little deep for me and I'm not sure that I get all of it but thank you for your advice
What did you learn?..That's what's important not what other people think.
Thank you for asking me that what I learned is that's not who I want to be I have enjoyed my sobriety for the past 12 days now that water that I was bitching about is what I want to drink.. need to find my way
Have you started considering what you can do to address the boredom?
No not as of yet still trying to figure that out thank you so much for your response to my post
