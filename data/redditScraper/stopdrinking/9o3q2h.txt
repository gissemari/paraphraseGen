So I relapsed Friday in a big way and am feeling terrible about it. Nothing bad happened aside from really worrying my dad. I don't know what I can do about this guilt or even if I should do anything about it. Lord knows I deserve this. Maybe remembering this feeling will help keep me sober. It's another day 2 and I will not drink today.

Shame is a huge motivational factor of staying sober. Stick to your plans and shame can transform into feeling proud of your achievement..I ll keep my fingers crossed for you.
When I find myself in a situation like this I ask myself what I would tell a very good friend a friend I deeply cared about and wanted only the best for to do. I take this mindset because I find that I am nowhere near as caring with myself as I would be with a dear friend. ..In this case I would advise a good friend (myself) to forgive herself and reflect on what derailed her so that she could plan better for the future. I would tell her that she is worthy of love and that any past action no matter how negative can be made into something positive if we learn from them and act on that insight. ..IWNDWYT!
