Relapse are awful. I promise to myself that i will not drink again. The shame is the worst. I want to be free and i will be free. No more booze. No more stupidity..

I'm in the same boat and made myself the same promise this morning. This time I *will* keep it...We can do it!
What are you planning to do so it doesn't happen again?
