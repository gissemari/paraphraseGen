[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy Hump Day! What's Up Wednesdays are when we celebrate our sobriety see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** I recently read (and really enjoyed) the memoir *Wild* by Cheryl Strayed. Then I saw an interview with the author who said  What is the definition of happiness in my life? For me it's very much that what I appear to be in my exterior life is very close to who I really am inside.  And I realized -- sobriety is helping me do that to close the gap between who I am inside and how I am living my life...**Struggle:** I am very frustrated that I have a sibling yet I am left completely alone to care for our elderly mother. Can't we have at least an 80/20 split of the work? Does it have to be me 100% of the time?..**General:** I am interested in what people on this site call the little voice that tells them that it's okay to have one drink (a total lie). One person calls it  Tricksy.  Another calls it  the devil's lawyer.  Many call it  Pedro. ..What do *you* call the voice that tries to convince you that it's okay to have a drink?..
----------immediate responses--------

T:  My second fourth of July sober!  High five...S:  Car.  Transmission is messed up.  Haven't had my car for two weeks.   So yeah not cool. ..G:  I don't have a name for that voice.  I've been an amateur practitioner of Buddhism for awhile  and I've learned that I'm not my thoughts or my emotions.  I acknowledge them and don't give them validity beyond what they are.
T: I did things today that wouldn't have been done if I had used today or not promised myself I wouldn't...S: I still have no one to share these great experiences with. I must push my boundaries to meet someone because if I don't I fear I will go back. It is a major catalyst of my use or has been in the past...G: Ego tells me when I should use. Self is the part that is concerned with true well being..
Triumph:     Had a great little vacation without even thinking about alcohol :)...Struggle:     The lease on my car is up next month. Since I've been with Mom 24/7 and haven't been on payroll things are getting pretty rough on that front...General:     I will never forget the hallucinations and DT's I had just before detox; the voice was more like blood curdling terrifying screams that sounded like the devil himself. So the devil is behind that voice. Fuck the devil and Fuck the zero!!! ;)
T: A nice overnight tour on the bike Shared a campfire with new friends.       .S: I wish my SO would join me in not drinking But I can't/won't force the issue.        .G: The little voice's name is 'Failure'. Failure is on ignore...
T: Just starting my day 15! Spent the day of the 4th working on my web business and the night completing a rigorous cycle and strength workout in the gym with my boyfriend now watching Netflix with green tea. First time in years I can say that I didn't use the 4th as an excuse to get extremely drunk...S: All the sugar! I ate a donut yesterday morning and then couldn't stop thinking about cupcakes. I've been very lenient on myself over the last couple of weeks and thinking cleaning up my diet sooner rather than later is scaring me. Like I'll have nothing...G: No name for her yet but know her very well.
Triumph: feel like i connected with a stranger without feeling totally awkward. ..Struggle: stayed up too late the night before so work was really exhausting feel kind of sick and grumpy and annoyed at myself..General: i just added a whole bunch of new stuff to my netflix list..I will not drink with you today :)
T: I'm only just embarking upon day 3 of sobriety so my triumph is that I went to bed sober last night - and happy about it...S: Now that alcohol is not damping down my thoughts I have to deal with them. They're telling me that all my friends are married with kids and jobs and I'm so far behind that maybe it's too late for me. Panic starts to rise and usually that triggers the need for booze...G: I call it persistent faulty brain wiring and I'm hoping to rewire slowly but surely for the rest of my life until my brain no longer remembers that difficult thoughts and emotions trigger thoughts of drinking. 
[removed]
T: First sober 4th in years and it felt absolutely amazing .!!..S: Husband continues to drink ...so the first few hours of his drinking I'm very temted!..G: don't have a name for that little voice yet.
Triumph: I had a nice 4 day weekend got some stuff done relaxed some had some fun. Back to work today with no wild stories to tell and I'm happy about that :) ..Struggle: Cigarettes. I saw an opportunity Saturday night to have one of my husband's cigs and I did it. Now I've been secretly smoking again and every day it's been a little more. I knew it would be like this if I did it and I did it anyways. I keep telling myself it's ok at least it's not drinking but it's not ok...General: I never really gave the voice a name as much as I don't like it it's part of me. The 'good' thoughts and the 'bad' thoughts are all my thoughts. As I've been sorely reminded with this smoking thing it's my actions that matter regardless of what any voices are telling me. 
.
**Triumph:** Winding up a good vacation...**Struggle:** Been on vacation for a week. I can track my struggles by an increase in posts here on SD...**The voice:** Fucker. Plain and simple
T: I've gotten through four days of July without alcohol. I turned down a beer offered to me yesterday as well...S: I'm starting to deal with anger and frustration. I had a very hectic Monday at work and kept getting upset with people. Last night all the fireworks in the neighborhood kept bothering me and really pissing me off. Couldn't everybody see that I was trying to sleep? That I have work in the morning? It's a weeknight for fucks sake. But I slowly realize how self-centered these thoughts are take a few breaths and let it go. It's frustrating but I'm trying to learn how to deal with it without turning to substances. It's just my monkey mind throwing a temper tantrum...G: I'm curious to see when I encounter that. Right now my willpower is pretty high but I know that slowly those thoughts will come. I'm hoping that I'll be further along in my meditative practice to see those thoughts for what they are and just know that it's fleeting. I know that family history tells me my dad had the same problem that he could never just stop at one and would drink until blackout (kinda like me!) So I'm going to learn to not listen to that voice telling me one is okay.
T: Weeded the vast majority of my garden and even did some pruning! I'm not a green thumb at all and only have a little experience with gardening...S: My father is not doing well and relapsed. My mother wants him to go into an inpatient facility but he refuses. He isn't a threat to himself or others so her hands are tied. Also after 4 days of sobriety I slipped up at a 4th of July party towards the end of the party. I was doing so well! I'm really discouraged even though I didn't drink much...G: I haven't thought of a name yet but maybe if I do that might help keep it in check better?
**Triumph:** Things have been good for me personally and professionally. I may have a full-time job offer soon work is going well and I'm getting into a solid fitness routine. It's becoming a lifestyle once again and I'm feeling better for it...**Struggle:** I'm still lonely. Letting myself feel things sucks sometimes but I'm getting there. I'm putting myself out there but it's a challenge. One day at a time right?..**General:** I never thought to name the voice in my head. If I had to choose maybe 'Bojack' or 'Stan'?
**Triumph:** Still keeping up reading at least 10 books a month. Still not drinking and feeling good doing Keto.  Still happy with myself. ..**Struggle:** My SO still drinks heavily a few times a week and it's going to come to a head soon. We started having arguments about when to leave places because she's having a good time drinking and having fun and I'm bored of drinking waters and repeating myself. She starts crying in public because she wants to stay and will either leave with me in a huff and be mad until she passes out then apologize when she wakes up or if it's our regular place I'll leave and pick her up later. Shit is driving me up a goddamn wall. ..**General:** Mr. Black. I think of him as my ego/a different person. I've borrowed this from the movie Revolver because for me it fits perfectly:..It is Mr. Black's goal to tease and tempt me into selfish desires and greed until I eventually destroy myself through my own arrogance and blindness. All while operating under the illusion that I know exactly what I'm doing and I am in complete control..."You've heard the voice in your head for so long you believe it to be you. You believe it to be your best friend. Where's the best place for a con to hide? The last place you'd look. He's hiding in your head. Pretending to be you. You're in a game. *The* game. Everyone is in it and nobody knows it." 
Triumph: Went to a 4th of July party and had a ball.  Turned down some delicious looking sangria no problem.  However everyone was smoking cigarettes and I had some intense cravings so I left after two hours.  In the past I've completely avoided events like that or left the moment I had a craving.  I'm happy with my more balanced approach...Struggle: I'm applying for a management position at the restaurant where I work and you would think it was the mother fucking state department.  Three interviews 17 essay questions.  Myself and the other candidates have worked there for years what can they possibly need to know?  I can see 2 or 3 questions to see how our written communication skills are but 17 just feels like I'm jumping through hoops so they can see me jump through hoops.  It's making me question if I even want to be management if these are the decisions they make.  ..General: A gal who really inspired me to quit drinking was at the party last night.  When we met she was sober and I was a drunk mess.  She was drunk last night and I could tell it wasn't good for her.  Not that I like her any less I'm in the struggle too.  But it was a reminder of how precious sobriety is and how easy it is to lose it.
T: I got paid holiday pay yesterday. Today at work a lot of people have the kind of swollen defeated look of a holiday hangover. I am very very happy to not be hungover today...S: My SO drank too much gin on Friday turned into his evil alter-ego and started an awful fight about absolutely nothing. I told him that behavior was not of the person I wanted to date. He hasn't drank since then. Hoping it continues...G: I am really glad I read this thread this morning because that voice needed a name. Ego vs. Self is absolutely something I need to be more aware of.
Woot.  Happy 5th of July!  Celebrating another dry day with you!.
**Triumph:**  Even though I spent the majority of my 4 days off at home it felt like a relaxing vacation instead of a forced stay.  I am (albeit slowly) learning how to find pleasure in caring for my home and staying on top of my affairs.  I have been accused of having a Peter Pan complex in the past (lord how I love to play outside!) and quitting alcohol is leading to me learning how to grow up while still having fun.  So yay although I'm still a little grumbly about my suburban lifestyle...**Struggle:**  When things get hard for me in relationships I do not yet know if it is my unhealthy patterns that are the cause or if I have justification.  I'm working to find a way to suss this out and to trust my instincts.  I think that if I am in a calm space and still feel the dissonance that I can trust my feelings and know that just because someone doesn't agree with them doesn't mean it's not what's right for ME.  Sorry this has gotten a bit long.  Clearly processing some stuff.....**General:**  I never really got around to giving that slippery voice a name.  My inner judge is named Carol after my mom as that's where she came from.  But I try to just hear the voice as part of me that's looking for escape and figure out what the real issue is instead of naming and scapegoating it.  To each their own!  :-)
Hey y'all. Happy Wednesday...T: The last time I was sober for a Fourth of July was when I was a kid. Yesterday was lovely. Thank y'all for helping me experience it...S: I am seriously crazy for my boyfriend who is also a recovering alcoholic. Our relationship is new and I can't help but feel really insecure in it. I almost always initiate affection and communication about relationship things. How can I get a better gauge for how he sees us? How he feels about me? (Without coming off as super super needy) Yikes I hate the way I sound...G: I don't have a name but I love the idea of Pedro. Definitely takes some power out of it--makes the voice more of a funny nuisance that I can brush off. I'm stronger than Pedro! 
The voice is Garaputo which I got from an Adam Sandler comedy CD.  I think of this spoiled brat that always wants more and more! Lol
T: Managed no to drink...S: My workplace is becoming more toxic and my anxiety is way up. I ended up skipping out on a get-together yesterday because my anxiety manifested as depression and I knew there would be drinking there so I bailed...G: I had a job interview with a recruiter on Monday so maybe I will get out of my current situation. Otherwise my new hobby is job applying. 
T: A week spent up at our extended family cabin where there is beer in every fridge and everyone is a fairly heavy social drinker. I crushed a full case of lemon-lime soda while here but I DID NOT DRINK!! This is a big deal and something my wife and I have been mentally preparing for since I began my sobriety...S: I handed over all my credit cards and cash to my wife when I began recovery my choice it was something I knew I needed to do. Every time I think I'm ready to carry some cash again my mind immediately starts thinking of ways to buy and hide alcohol. That sucks. I don't know how long this part will last...G: Well in my faith tradition we call that voice "the flesh" or "the sin nature." It's the thing we're trying to kill.
T: No drinking on 4th of July. Saw some GREAT fireworks with fellow sober friends. Made some collage art and am functioning well..S: Looking for work is tough but much easier without hangovers..G: My voice is called "the Monster". I know it when I hear it.
T: I didn't drink yesterday despite mega cravings. ..S: I've been an irritable mofo and I'm trying to figure out why. Too much caffeine leading to anxiety leading to irritability maybe?..G: I'm gonna call that voice that was tormenting me yesterday The Fucker just like one of the previous posters. That Fucker worms his way into my brain telling me Just One won't do any harm. Fuck you Fucker. ..(Sorry for all of the profanity.)
T: first sober 4th in decades...S: my house. I've let a lot of things go and it needs work especially outside. Stressful for a single-momma. :(..G: she's "Dumbass" because I always ack like one when I'm hammered. 
Triumph: 100 days! This is the longest I've been sober [while not pregnant] in probably 20 years. ..Struggle: I am very stressed out lately for no apparent reason.  I guess it's just general burnout from life and the pressure to fit so much into the summer...General: I am feeling frustrated that there never seem to be enough hours in the day. 
T: In just 12 hours I'll be two days free from alcohol. My body is healing bit by bit...S: I'm physically dependent on Klonopin. I've been taking .5 mg every day for three months which is bad news. I did this in conjunction with drinking (I know I know it's a terrible thing to do). Since I've stopped drinking I've been taking well over my prescribed dose to help with the withdrawals. I have an appointment with my awesome psychiatrist tomorrow where I'll come clean about what's been going on and hopefully make a plan to safely taper...G: she doesn't have a name yet because for so long I believed that she was me.
Triumph: Made it through dinner party with no booze on Monday with a couples group in which the loudest and most talkative are the least interesting. I enjoy this group for the most part but a few of them can get on my last nerve sometimes. Monday was one of those times.  I guess that's a triumph -- or at least a major relief!..Struggle:  I'm realizing that my job is one of my triggers. I'm probably not unique in that. Checking in here a few times a day helps. ..General:  I feel great.  And I am humbly confident that I am done with drinking. Even when the cravings set in I no longer ask myself how I'm ever going to quit forever. I just say not today and I move on.   ..RE: Name for the voice in my head - Screwtape from C.S. Lewis "The Screwtape Letters."
I like that definition of the inside matching the outside.  I find it easier to be my true self without the booze too but I am still defining myself still looking at what I want to improve and feel a freedom of not limiting those dreams by imposing imaginary walls...*Triumph:*  Made it through a lot of work and home projects over the weekend and managed not to get too stressed out.  Stress is always a big trigger for me and learning to recognize unrealistic goals and let some things go has been useful...*Struggle:*  It's not a struggle yet but I'm heading out to a festival that has always been a huge drinking occasion for me in the past.  I'm feeling confident that I won't drink but curious about what I will do (likely have a lot more fun actually watching the shows/art/people etc).  A ton of friends go there that I don't see often and it will be interesting to see how interacting with them all in that situation will be...*General:*  I don't really have a name for that voice.  I hear it so infrequently but when I do it's pretty loud.  Maybe "Loud Mouth Liar" would be a good name.
T: I realized that moderate drinking leads back to alcoholism for me even if it takes months. No more self denial. Only action is warranted now..S: Had an all night bender. Called my SO at 5am when I got home. Told him what I'm dealing with and to distance himself from me if he wants while I push myself to stay sober...G: To not drink tonight. Or tomorrow. I was in bed all day from my bender so I know I won't drink tonight. Just sleep. But tomorrow I have to win.
T : Im still going strong actually been feeling so good that at this point I'm considering this not being a break and just not drinking for good. ..S: I've been a lot more emotional amd without alcohol I've been turning to food. My struggle is trying to fond a healthy outlet...G: I don't have a name for that voice I've honestly been trying to remember that I'm not my thoughts or emotions another struggle!
T: Last month I started using Rosetta Stone to learn Mandarin. I absolutely bombed my Spanish courses in high school but I'm happy to say that I enjoy learning this time around and I believe that I'm doing well. I only have the strength to study when I'm sober so it is one more reason to stay away from the booze...S: I'm struggling with the idea of AA. I've been going on and off over the past few months. I even sort of have a sponsor. With that said I'm an atheist and have been for quite some time. Some of the meetings are painful to sit through especially when the entire discussion is centered on our higher power...G: It's the "fuck it" voice. As in fuck it I don't care about the consequences just drink. I forget the name of the technique but when I'm having cravings I try to think about what will happen if I do so and how badly I'll regret it in the morning. Sometimes that voice simply doesn't care and somehow tricks me into thinking that picking up a pint of vodka after work is a great idea. 
You gob of spit! You scum-sucking pig! ... that's the voice with apologies to the late Marlon Brando in "One-eyes Jacks."
