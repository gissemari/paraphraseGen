At the beginning just getting past 6pm was a struggle. Then I did it. So on to the next day. Had one beer on day 2 so I reset my badge. After that I've surprised myself each day. I've been able to shut down the voice in my head saying one drink is ok. But...Weekends bring on a different more intense anxiety though. So like last week I've pledged to not drink for today only. I will not worry about tomorrow because it's not today. One day. I can do that.

It sounds to me like you got this Mom!  I don't have to "do the weekend" I merely have to do TODAY.
I feel you! I work in a bar and after my Friday double shifts I always have a shift drink. and then 6 more. I don't work tomorrow so that would be even more of a reason to get hammered after my 9pm clock out. instead I decided work a few extra hours tonight and send another coworker home early. I'm going to make money during my usual drinking hours instead of spending money. ..not drinking with you today! 
I won't drink with you today.
