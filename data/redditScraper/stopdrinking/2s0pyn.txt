I am so upset with myself. I was really lonely so I drank. I also think I was feeling unstable due to PMS? Now I feel lonelier than ever.

The good news is that you're starting again.  Have you heard of HALT?  Hunger Anger Lonely Tired.  These are four common triggers for a lot of people--that might help you get a leg up on this next time.  Good luck to you.
I am sorry you feel lonely. Might sound corny but have you tried getting involved in things around your city? I literally had to google things to do that don't involve drinking. Sadly here up north there aren't many this time of year.
Being around people or even having an event to look forward to where I know there will be friendly faces takes the edge off of those feelings for me..And not focusing too long on them...there are always chores to do and the feelings always pass. .Could it be that you still see a useful comfort in alcohol when unpleasant feelings settle in? 
I'm feeling very lonely too.  I was going to go to a surprise birthday party but due to drama with a friend (former friend?) I was basically uninvited from the party and am now sitting here alone. I felt so great this morning but now I feel absolutely horrible and abandoned (though for probably good reason alcoholics do a good job at alienating themselves from the ones they love and care about). It's taking a lot of will power for me to not drink the loneliness away so I understand where you are coming from and I don't think you should beat yourself up too much over it. Me being a social butterfly I can't stand being lonely. Just have comfort knowing that there are others feeling the same way. Good luck and take care love you stranger. Keep up the good fight
AA meetings saved me from being alone and AA meetings were the path to my new life sober.
