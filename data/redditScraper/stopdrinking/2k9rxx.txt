I've got 7 months now after 23 years of drinking and 5 dui's. The miracle isn't material or better relationships. The miracle my miracle is HOPE! It is something that I thought I would never have again. I'm finally free and riding that pink cloud. I don't share much so I wanted to take this chance to tell those that are still struggling keep digging. All hope has given me is a chance and a chance is something that I have never given myself. Please keep coming back because the miracle is real.
