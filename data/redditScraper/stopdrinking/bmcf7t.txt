I am 6 months tomorrow or is it today?   Last drink Nov 8.  I still think about it but I don't crave it anymore.  iwndwyt
Congrats! Thank you for checking in. It's so inspiring! I suspect it is going to be like quitting smoking. Eventually I forgot I ever did it. Seeing these posts gives me hope this will be the same! ..Besides ice cream is so much better than booze. All the yum and none of the dumb.
Congratulations!  IWNDWYT
Awesome!
Congratulations!  It's pretty awesome isn't it?!
