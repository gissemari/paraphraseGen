Its only been two days and Im having trouble with cravings. Im too lazy to get up off my ass and do anything like workout or anything like that to get my mind off alcohol and usually when I have a craving I just go get alcohol and say ill quit tomorrow. This time Im serious about quitting but cant find the power to leave the booze alone. Any advice?

I don't know if this will work for you but it's something that's been helping me and I had the exact same issue as you did (I'm now 30 days in for whatever that's worth)..Take the money you're going to spend on booze and buy something else with it. Something that you'll enjoy a new video game or something like that...I've taken away my "budget" for booze and I've slowing been sinking it into a new computer for myself. It's something that I've wanted to get for a long time but never could afford it because I would just drink the money away...If you spend the money on something that you can use to distract yourself from drinking all while knowing you can't afford to drink in the first place it might just help you. 
It'll get easier. Maybe try reading a book until you find something more substantial. Or perhaps think about upcoming holidays / birthdays and do some gift shopping... just an idea.
get yourself some ice cream. If you don't think you can handle that take a nice hot shower have some tea or something (face it a cup of coffee would be better than a hangover) and lock yourself in. Watch TV do some push ups masturbate like crazy... whatever it takes. It's just a night and it'll pass. You'll need to find yourself a better coping mechanism than sticking your head in the sand eventually but it'll do for a night
Same boat.
