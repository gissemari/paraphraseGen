I had been sober only five days this time in. Have been reading so much literature on sobriety and going to meetings every day. I was feeling so strong and enjoying my life more....but alas  ..Yesterday I had a work commitment that kept me occupied for 15 intense hours straight. I was offered cocktails and declined through the evening but when I got home at 12:30am I was craving a beer so badly that I caved and walked to the store. ..Alone in my home and mind I rationalized that because I couldn't make it to an AA meeting that I would just allow myself this slip that no one would know but me. The internal dialogue went on  you will go to two meetings tomorrow and get back on track in the morning.....don't be too hard on yourself everyone makes mistakes.....limit yourself to just six you will feel fine tomorrow....  on and on until the decision settled in...I drank the six while chain smoking (something I never do sober) and of course feel like shit physically and mentally today. Still plan on attending the meetings and not having a drink today but feel sick with panic that I will give in and fail again. Don't want to be trapped by this anymore! Going down this rabbit hole of self loathing and pity is not healthy. ..I am strong and I can do this. I will not drink today.

Yes you can do this!!!!
Not giving up after a relapse is the most important step I think. I chain smoke (or smoke a lot) while drinking as well... One more reason I dislike it so much. When not drinking I smoke 3 to max 5 cigarettes a day which is completely different... I will not drink with you today!
You can do this!!..What can you learn from your lapse  for next time?..IWNDWYT
