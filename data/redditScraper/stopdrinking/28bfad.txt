**The Past Few Days:**.So over the past three days I have been to myself for the majority of the time as my sober friends are no longer nearby since it is vacation and my old friends who do use in moderation are overly concerned about me being sober and have "exiled" me (exiled being the feeling that I am having when they don't include me in activities because they are going to be under the influence during them and don't really consider if I would like to be apart of the activity and just kind of blacklist me for being sober). I'm pretty much alone here in western Massachusetts and I have yet to find a home group that has people around my age group that don't fall into the "fresh/new" group of youths that are not sincere about being sober or bettering themselves. I have to admit that I have only gone to three meetings over the past year so I don't believe that my statement is fair to apply to the vast amount of people that attend these meetings...**The Crux:**.I have been having these non-sensible thoughts about relapsing which is why I am bothering to go seek advice from this community. My old ego is kind of regaining life and I have been able to quell it thus far but my therapist and old sponsor told me that I was being selfish in being selfless and using people as a proxy to feel good by helping them out. They suggested that I become more focused on myself and do things for myself my girlfriend said something along these lines as well... Anyways these thoughts of relapsing to be able to accepted back into the folds of my friends and age group continue to fester in my mind. I know that relapsing is incredibly dangerous and for only a small percentage of addicts can actually use responsibly and only even then struggle (I don't think I can use moderately and I know it is a very very unsafe mindset to think so). ..**TL;DR:**.Sober for 2+ years found out that I am overly attached to my girlfriend. Having problems finding other people around my age that are sober or are willing to hang out with me while I am sober (I don't care if they are or not). I am having thoughts of "moderate" drinking (which is bullshit and is a slippery slope) in order to be more approachable or have people not be awkward around me while they use. Haven't been attending meetings and haven't started step 11 as I am atheist and have been struggling with the religious/spiritual aspect...Sorry about the length of this post...**Update:**.Thanks everyone for the support I'm back on track and working hard on improving myself!

Dude. Huge giant props to you for posting here first. That's a hard humbling thing to do. But it's the right thing to do. ..I don't have the qualifications for sponsoring or anything. I didn't do much stepwork and I no longer attend AA. I don't really have any big life-changing advice or anything...Whatever happens however alone and pissed off and hurt you get bull through it. There is no problem that you personally have right now that can't get worse after a night getting drunk. The respite will be brief and for the first what 30 mins? It'd probably be very relieving. Can you imagine how you'd feel the next day though? My god I only have like 8 months and the thought of how I'd feel the morning after a hard relapse makes me nauseous.  ..Keep coming here. Good post and congrats on over two years. I want that someday. 
Drinking for me is sitting around all night drinking beers and watching tv while playing video games instead of engaging in my life and doing things that are actually good for me.  It makes me feel terrible.  I wouldn't give up sobriety for sitting around stunned all the time...Alcohol is very isolating. 
Props on the courage to post and ask for support /u/FloatingInTheSea...Let me take a stab at the most controversial part of your post.  I have sponsored lots of guys over the years.  Most of the younger men and women I know who came in to AA to some extent grapple with this issue the HP.  Let's go back to what [Ebby Thacher told Bill Wilson](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/27v1ap/the_big_book_study_series_part3_bills_story/) who I believe was at best an agnostic: choose the higher power of your own conception.  The best that I could do--and this worked--was look in the mirror and admit that while I didn't exactly believe in any conception of God--I me myself wasn't God.  This complete admission allowed for the sheer existence of all sorts of power beyond my conception that was more powerful than me.  At that very moment I had the white light earth shaking experience!  ..At that moment and thereafter to now I turn my will and life over to this power every morning.  Every morning I make a deliberate and conscious decision to access this power that is so far beyond my conception and human capacity to understand let alone describe.  I am closest when I say this conception is not the "hairy thunderer" of the Sistine Chapel ceiling.  But as I said this HP ain't me.  ..You my friend seem to be struggling with that last obstacle--your ego--not your inability to access a higher power.  I don't say this lightly or pompously or to insult you.  So many of us struggle to finally totally LET GO and when we do we finally recognize that alcoholism is something that I am not going to think my way out of--and back into moderate drinking.  That being the case join us on the sober highway Let GO.
There's no shame in admitting to old thoughts. I can tell you that after a few years of building a sober life inside and outside the rooms I have no jealousy anymore of my old drinking friends. My life is so goddamn full that I don't have time for most anyone anymore. The last thing on my mind is seeking out people who want to be drinking around me. Most of my old friends prefer to invite me around when they aren't getting plastered... and my old friends that like getting plastered a lot don't even bother...But this is all superfluous. You know all this. You say that you know your moderate drinking thoughts are bullshit and I assume you know this because you know where drinking will take you. You know how you like to drink... and that's to get drunk (I'm making assumptions I hope I'm on target. Correct me if I'm not.)..So... what can you do to build your sober life? This is along the suggestion of your therapist's advice. My suggestion... what I had to do... I started going back to meetings soaking up as much help as I felt like from other people... I made friends with some nutty older dudes not really giving a fuck what anyone thought about me... eventually an idea for a new career hit me and I've been working as a music teacher for the past 3 years. The more I work on that and my music and my band as well as my AA relationships as well as my family  as well as my step work (just finished 4th step 9 w/ sponsor) as well as my old friends as well as my sports teams (I like basketball and Ultimate Frisbee pick-up and club games)... and so on... and I'm pretty much out of time. I shouldn't even be posting here I should be going to sleep...I haven't thought about drinking in a long time. I've been working on quitting smoking (78 days!) as well as improving some other behaviors.....So what's the point? I don't know what is it you could do to take care of yourself? Really genuinely take care of yourself?..Everyone hits a wall at a couple years. What gets people sober initially isn't good enough to keep them sober when life gets hard and boring. This is extremely common. You have to evolve your sobriety into something bigger and grander. Whatever that means to you.
I really admire you for posting. As a former chronic relapser you are doing what I seemingly could not do for so long. This is a great start to taking the power out of that tricky voice in your head...Summer is upon us (in the northern hemisphere anyway) and it was my prime relapse season. By going back out so many times I learned the hard way how important it is to keep going forward no matter what. ..I like car analogies: For me sobriety is a road and slipping in sobriety was like doing a U-turn and going back from where I came. When I'd get sober again it was another U-turn back in the right direction. Oh I just got so tired of all the U-turns--what a waste of gas and time. And I had seen this particular scenery already. So I learned to "trudge the road of happy destiny" to keep moving forward even when it was inch by inch...It was not easy for me to use the new coping tools. It took a long time and happened in fits and starts. Relapse came when I lost faith in the process or got stuck at some new milestone or got frustrated because I temporarily (and it was ALWAYS temporary) felt unrewarded for all my good behavior (which was really just *normal* behavior). What I saw as obstacles or sticking points were really opportunities to move forward and take it to the next level. My discontent was actually telling me exactly what I needed to work on...How can you make new sober friends if you aren't hanging out where they can be found? Don't let step 11 keep you from the people that understand most what you're going through. 2+ years is amazing--keep up the good work!
