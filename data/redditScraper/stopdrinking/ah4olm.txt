Things are now up in the air with my girlfriend I only recently started seeing her. (just over a month)..Today has been harder not to drink for other reasons too (stress at work horrible bus journey)..If it doesn't work out well with this girl then I'm definitely going to stay single. I HAVE to stay sober. I can't and won't relapse...Gonna get myself to a meeting tomorrow too..Thanks for letting me vent ..IWNDWYT

Good for you! Do you know HALT? Don't get too Hungry Angry Lonely or Tired.
Good idea to focus on yourself first and take care of yourself. Getting anything negative or stressful out of your life will help you stay focused. Everything will fall into place after you give yourself some time..Keep up the good work
Thank you for sharing!  IWNDWYT
Keep up the good work!  Congrats on 3 days.  I hear AA is big on not dating for a year.
