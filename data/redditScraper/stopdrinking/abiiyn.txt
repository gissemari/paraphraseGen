After relapsing in October I recommitted to sobriety on November 9th. I made it through normally my hardest month(December) sober! My birthday  Christmas and new years eve all fall in December. But I made it through them all! ..I will be 7 weeks sober on Thursday and I feel great!..Iwndwyt!

Woohoo!!! That's the best news ever. It was definitely difficult for me too. I even had a shot in my hand but at the last second I passed it to my friend next to me. IWNDWYT!
Congrats!  IWNDWYT
