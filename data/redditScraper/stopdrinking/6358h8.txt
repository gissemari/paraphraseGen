First of all ignore the bad. 33 days?? Yeah right. Try 3. The past 30 were just the days I spent hiding from the sub. Anyways..........Greetings from another time zone. ..It's 2pm Monday afternoon here. Two more hours and I can clock out. I didn't know how I was going to even make it *to* work today let alone make it through. Last night when I saw the clock hit 3am I didn't know how this would be possible. ..Don't get me wrong I was ready for bed at 8. Need and tidy and sober. And I lay and I lay and I lay. Same thing happened two nights ago.. In fact in my three nights sober I think it's fair to say I only really slept once. When I went in I'd been awake 46 of the past 48 hours. ..And you know what? ..Working on 2 hours of sleep feels so so **SO** much better than it does working after a six hour "sleep" after my nightly 12 beer blitz. Was I on my A-game? Nope. My B-game? Eh maybe. But I didn't spend my day with a head pounding so bad I basically had to hold it still. I wasn't          didn't spend all day running to the bathroom. I didn't see red cause someone didn't fill the fucking copy machine. And most of all I didn't live in a deathly fear that someone knew. Could they see it in my eyes? My face? Could they smell it on me? ..Actually that's not the most of all. The most of all is that I didn't spend the day cursing myself hating myself for what I am. God why didn't I drink last night I told myself not to. I always tell myself     Why Can't I stop. I'm such a low life. ..None of that today. And it's Monday! Of any day that's the day I can pretty much guarantee to be hungover. Generally what happens is I'm so hungover Monday that I tell myself I need some beers Monday night to taper off and then say well this week is already soiled. ..Still gonna be struggle tonight I tend to think that *any* victory I have pretty much earns me a drink. Gonna try to just enjoy how good this feels right now.

Hey well done I won't be drinking with you today. My sleeping patterns were also very erratic at the beginning but it got much better over time. And it's like you say still much better than being hungover.
