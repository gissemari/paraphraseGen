About me:  Alcoholic male 21 years old college kid frat boy clubber/raver live with parents outside Philly..I'm really struggling right now to make new friends that are compatible with my new sober lifestyle.  I go to AA meetings 3-4 times a week 2 of them being Young Peoples meetings.  I do hang out occasionally with people from the meetings but not often...I've always had a good amount of friends and more recently I joined a fraternity so even more friends and social life.  The problem is obviously they drink quite a lot.  I don't think its a good idea to keep hanging out with them.  It frustrates me to no end that if I just started drinking again I could: party until the sun gets up get laid often have tons of social activities.  In sobriety I haven't gotten even close to getting laid don't have many activities to do and just feeling lonely...My way of old way of hanging out with people/making new friends would be to go to a club bar or party.  Obviously can't do that anymore.  I find it **very** difficult to find sober things to do with people my age.  Nearly everyone including me just wants party drink maybe drug and let loose...I think I just need patience with my self learning how to be social without alcohol and finding new hobbies...but in the meantime....**Let's hear some advice/stories on making new friends in sobriety**

Hey man I don't have anything helpful to say about this topic but it was breaking my heart to see a post with "Lonely" in the title still have no replies after 2 hours. ..[Here's a picture of a squirrel.](http://www.funnypica.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Funny-Squirrels-Funny-Squirrel-Picture-92-FunnyPica.com_.jpg) ..Best of luck to you. :)
You're in college in a major city. Join clubs that interest you. Ask girls out for coffee I guarantee you there are plenty of women that aren't into getting shitfaced every weekend. It's been my experience that they're a lot more interesting than the alternative.  Hang in there man it's worth it...Edit: I waited til my 30s to get sober so I meet people at meetings or work. Sorry nothing groundbreaking to offer there. 
im going to tell you what i told my son when he moved to a town where he didnt know anybody. go to a church that has a club for people your age. do some volunteer work. join and go to a gym i think most people who go to work out have a healthier life style..where im at we have a club thats open for alcoholics or addicts where there is cards and a pool table any one is welcome as long as you arent drinking.. now if your anything like my son your probably rolling your eyes and thinking what a freakin dumb ass iam. thats ok hopefully something works out for you
I have so few friends that even my facebook page is lonely...Why not try making friends with just one friend...That friend could even be your higher power  :) 
I'm 25 and one of the most powerful things a 23 year old told me (who had 7 years of sobriety and horror stories of being a close to death alcoholic at only 17) was that in time he got so comfortable with it he no longer had to look for sober friends. ..Now he just has friends and he has no problem being around them at clubs parties bars etc. ..That helped me a lot because my career takes place in bars. I am in a different bar until almost 2AM 7 nights a week and I love what I do. I know that things will be difficult by choosing to be in that atmosphere but as long as I stay strong I can stop thinking about "being sober" and just be me... while remembering everything. :)..It may not help now but it takes some of the pressure off when you get overwhelmed about the future......Also a trick I learned a long time ago (when I had much more sobriety under my belt) was that if I kept a soda water with lime in my hand no one ever questioned me I would drink a ton of them and then as an added bonus I would be so full that I wouldn't even dream of drinking. I also ended up having a good relationship with the bartenders and they would make my drinks in rocks glasses and pour me water behind the counter when someone wanted to buy me shots I would just make out that it was rumple and then make a face after I took the shot of water....The people who were close to me and that I loved knew but I saw no reason to explain myself to my business acquaintances....I'm not saying go to bars. I'm just sharing what worked for me.
hello!..philly suburb guy here too. 20. dont currently have any sober friends. im on day 82...i go to a lot of shows because i love live music but for the most part i would be the only sober one there so i would love to have a fellow non-drinker accompany me. pm me if you'd like.
I heard something at a meeting last night.  "If you truly pay attention then you will realize that more people than you think are actually not drinking."  One suggestion that has been made to me was to find new hobbies to spend all of my new found free time.  You will be amazed at the type of people you will attract if you are radiating a sense of healthiness from within.  I now find myself actually enjoying talking to random people whereas before I would view them as a distraction keeping me from drinking.  I don't know if you can get anything out of that but keep it up.  Things change if you make the necessary changes from within.
