When I was in my first couple of months in sobriety I was miserable and handling life without alcohol was scary and definitely a new frontier and I felt alone. ..But then I stumbled across a clip of [Robin Williams talk about alcoholism in his standup special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLtPp_xIpC4) and not only did I have a good laugh but I also started to cry because he hit home on some things that resonated with my drinking habits and it made me realize that I'm not alone when it comes to struggles with alcoholism. ..WE are not alone and thanks to AA and the SD sub I've been able to do this one day at a time for a little while now. ..Peace love and [Lacroix Recipes](http://www.lacroixwater.com/recipes/) for all!..Capt. ;)

Robin: being a functional alcoholic is like being a paraplegic lap dancer sure you can do it but just not as good as everyone else...Lmao. RIP.
He has always been my favorite. It was good to hear him making people laugh again. Hadn't seen this before! Thanks for sharing! 
Great clip funny yet painfully accurate. 
RIP Robin Williams. He was one of us and he no doubt died from untreated alcoholism. ..rock bottom for me was when the conditions around me where deteriorating faster than i could lower my standards. Thats when i knew i was ready. .....
Wow so much truth worded in a joking manner. Man do I miss him. RIP Robin. You helped this recovering alkie laugh today. 
I met a guy at rehab last year who had been to the same rehab center as Robin Williams while Williams' was there as a patient. But there wasn't any gossip to be had. Just human beings trying to better their lives.
Funny...and brutally honest.
I'm not very smart. Can someone do me a huge favor and explain what does "violating one's standards" mean? Thanks.
&gt;Williams used to be a big-drinking cocaine addict but quit both before the birth of his eldest son in 1983 and stayed sober for 20 years. On location in Alaska in 2003 however he started drinking again. He brings this up himself and the minute he does he becomes more engaged...&gt;"I was in a small town where it's not the edge of the world but you can see it from there and then I thought: drinking. I just thought hey maybe drinking will help. Because I felt alone and afraid. It was that thing of working so much and going fuck maybe that will help. And it was the worst thing in the world." What did he feel like when he had his first drink? "You feel warm and kind of wonderful. And then the next thing you know it's a problem and you're isolated."..yeah wow.
