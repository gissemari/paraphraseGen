This is going to be long and somewhat unorganized. You don't have to read it but I had to get it out...My name is Tony and I'm an alcoholic. I have never actually typed it or said it and really meant it until just now if that makes sense. If I had ever said it before it was joking around with my 6th beer or when accepting a drink from someone even though in some instances over the past couple of years I likely knew it to be true deep down. I am writing this because today the 135th day of my new found sobriety I am struggling. Work has slowed down at the moment and I have extra  free  time. Additionally the work that I have in front of me is not what I am comfortable with and will require me to seek help. I have not felt like this in a while. In the past I would have terrible trouble starting the work allowing myself to procrastinate which would lead me to feeling worried and guilty unable to enjoy anything that I was doing. Alcohol made it ok for me to sit around and play video games or binge watch tv or whatever. It made it so that I could address my issues the next day and focus on what I wanted to do without as much guilt. If anything my guilt only showed itself when I would drunkenly rebuke myself in the mirror and then promise myself that it wouldn't happen again while also saying that I should enjoy tonight since I already started. Tonight was mine and tomorrow was something that I would worry about then. The problem was that the next day I would do the same thing. I would lay out reasons why I shouldn't be going down to the convenience store to buy beer while also playing mind games with myself rationalizing that it was fine for me to get drunk again  tonight.  I know it was the reason that I lost my job 2 years ago and the reason that it took me so long to get back into the field that I studied for and yet this past week the rationalizations have become much louder than just a whisper in the back of my head that I had been able to easily brush away since I stopped drinking...My current job which I started at the beginning of the year has been great. A friend that I went to school with helped me get it and I get to travel around the country from project to project seeing so much of the country. Since I stopped drinking I have been able to go hiking and really take in everything that is around me. I have gotten healthier and I find that I enjoy myself more. Life on the road isn't bad when you have nothing really keeping you in one place and I am really enjoying it right now. But it does lend itself to drinking daily and I certainly was doing that when I started. I was comfortable with my work and was having a great time. After a few months however of drinking every night and eating like a pig I became tired of living like a slob and not experiencing the present or the places I was traveling. The mirror scoldings and gas station debates began frequently happening again and yet I couldn't not drink after work. I would look around a hotel room littered with beer cans and be too lazy to clean up but also too embarrassed to let housekeeping come in and clean up. But boy did I have the drinking part down to a science. I would have a plan of what I would want to eat and either pick it up or have my order ready or set a specific delivery time when I knew I would be good and drunk. I would pick up high AC content beer right after work between 5 and 7pm be drunk usually within 2 hours eat pass out wake up at 3 or 4 to chug some water and be up by 6 to be on site by 7. Weekends were planned too and consisted of going out with the guys waking up and picking up for day drinking passing out for a bit and going out again at night. Hangovers weren't a problem as I never really got them especially when I would get up to drink water before getting up later to do stuff. My biggest issue really since leaving college was if I hadn't planned it out to where I had enough in the fridge or didn't drink what I had fast enough to get to the level of drunkenness that I required. I would then have to take 1 or 2 road beers with me to pick up more. Even though I knew better than to drive I would eventually rationalize it hit the road and pick up some more. ..Then one day June 20 I decided that enough was enough. I put in one more night of drinking (as was the plan) and did not have a drink on June 21 Fathers Day. My dad was a functioning alcoholic who died of cancer a little over 8 years and 2 weeks ago. It was never a problem for me to be around him and he was always there for me but if it was the evening time you knew he would have a beer in hand. He tried to stop a few times after he got a DUI but never went more than a month until he got really sick near the end. Anyway I watched the golf tournament as we would do when I was younger and thought of him. I made a promise to him and myself that I would not drink anymore. It was destroying me and was the only thing that I did outside of work. It was unhealthy and I needed a change. Moderation never worked in the past and was not an option. I made that decision and promise and still as I sit here the rationalizations for drinking tonight swirl around in my head...I love that feeling of being drunk. When I start I don't stop until I at least make it to that point. If I am out I also very much enjoy the ride to that drunken state as it gave me the ability to be tremendously social. I had some great experiences and a few bad ones too. I never got in any trouble with the law and other than doing 8 grand worth of damage to a car the summer between HS and college which I paid for in cash to get fixed I never really had any serious trouble at all. Anyhow within the last couple of weeks I began lurking on this subreddit perhaps because I could sense I was possibly getting close to succumbing to my desires to drink for just one night or perhaps because I needed to talk to someone. Though I didn't feel like I could completely relate to anyone's stories as we all have at least slightly different ones I did like that people were made to feel that they were not alone in their efforts to stop drinking. I feel like  Just one night  for me is doable today but I know that the next  just one night  will come sooner than this one will have and the next one after that even sooner until I am back to rationalizing every night away. And I still have thoughts considering grabbing a 12-pack after work today...Anyway I thought I'd write this out really as kind of a therapy session for myself and it turned into something I wanted to post. I think it has helped me to better understand what I was like when I was drinking and what I would more than likely get back in to if I drank tonight. I feel like I wrote a bunch but also left a lot out too. And though I have told people in my life that I have stopped drinking because it is a bit of a problem for me (I know a few friends tha know it is more of a problem than I have admitted and they have been great) I haven't really had a discussion with anyone since I quit about much of the stuff I've written above or about the day that I chose to stop so this was helpful...Good luck to everyone experiencing their own struggles today. I will fight the urge and not drink today..

Fellow road warrior chiming in. Very powerful post thanks for that. I think I needed to read something like it today. ...Have you looked into support groups at all? I find they can be a welcome consistency on the road and they fill the time. 
Boy I bet you feel better getting that out. It was a strong read and a solid reminder of the monotony and pain of active addiction. .Thank you for your honesty. ..I was a hot mess when I stopped drinking. Work was getting challenging. I don't know how I avoided formal warnings. ..I couldn't answer the phone or empty the mail box. ..I smelt pretty ordinary too. Musty cigarette clothes and booze sweat. ..Gah. ..It was a minor miracle that I found this sub and then started going to meetings. I knew I needed real life accountability. What I didn't bargain on was finding friends and pockets of very real joy. The struggle to not drink has faded. I've lost the obsession. ..I knew I could stop but I also knew I wouldn't stay stopped without help. I've found AA the right mix for me but there are a bunch of recovery support models. Good luck with your journey. ..You're not alone.
