Over the past week I've been dealing with the back-of-the-mind thoughts that creep in after a while - thinking about an upcoming vacation and telling myself I should be able to drink while I'm there. Struggling with the concept of never drinking again while still acknowledging that I have proven to myself that I cannot moderate and should not try to do so. FOMO. ..Then the other night I thought to myself - being a sober person is a whole new thing. It's something that I want to be part of my identity. It's going to continue to allow me to do stuff I never could as a daily drinker. I decided to do something nice for my family for Valentine's Day because as a sober person I *gasp* actually ENJOY waking up early. So today I got up at 5am and had time to have 2 cups of coffee instead of my usual 1 and I made bacon and biscuits for my husband and kids. Our normal morning is running around crazy and eating clif bars in the car on the way to school. This morning was really nice. Maybe I'll do this more often. :)

Sounds like a much more refreshing and loving start to the day! Well done you  
I've been enjoying my extra coffee time lately too. Even enjoying reading books and my quiet calm time. Normally I would have enjoyed a nice bottle of red with my steak and lobster for Valentine's. Tonight I will enjoy my cranberry juice in a wine glass with my steak and lobster. We can do this! IWNDWYT
