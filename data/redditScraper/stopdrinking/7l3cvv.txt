I've been avoiding situations with alcohol since my last relapse and reset. I wanted to be more careful this time. Last night was the first time where I was with people who were drinking and I did not drink! I tried to not even look at their glasses. The thing was the conversations about being drunk were just so obnoxious and not funny that I didn't really enjoy myself. Also the constant caddy conversations were driving me crazy. It was a group that I have hung out with for 5 years. We get together monthly. I told them last night that I just have too much going on next year to continue with the group. I felt so relieved that I don't have to be in that situation again. I know there will always be times I will be around alcohol  but I felt really good about letting go of something that no longer serves my life just like I did with alcohol. I will not drink with you today!

Well done! Yeah drunk conversation is a lot more boring than I ever realized. It's nice knowing I never have to listen to it again if I don't want to.
I get annoyed now around drunks. On one hand I'm thankful it's no longer me. On the other hand there are only so many times i care to hear &lt;insert stupid story on repeat&gt;.
This is really good to hear      I like it when people start to **own** it!  I am happy not to drink with you today :)
