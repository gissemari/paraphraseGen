You never pay attention to how long a day is until you try to do it sober. To all of you that are struggling one more minute. Knock that minute out then work on the next one. To all of you cruising don't forget what got you there. Be well everyone and keep on rocking it sober. IWNDWYT

Yes indeed.  I'm retired and so the days can creep by.  I do have a few hobbies which help to pass the time.  Constructive ways to pass the time can be a life saver.  IWNDWYT
Thanks for sharing this! I've really been feeling this today. Several times I've thought maybe I can just walk down to the store and grab just one beer.  I keep trying to distract myself with other things. 
Back at you brother  . Sober living.
One minute at a time every day. It can be done. IWNDWYT
