At least 3 times a week I have relapse dreams. They don't bother me nearly as much as they did initially but I still hate having them. .However last nights dream was different. Someone offered me a beer and I said "no thanks I don't drink." That was it. I woke up with a smile. Thank you subconscious mind I really appreciated that one!

Nice change! I have them all the time. Just part of the process. Reminds of when you have a tough breakup and you dream about the other person for a long time.
I would never in my life cheat on my partner she is the whole world to me. But i often have nightmares where i dream that i have cheated on her. Not the actual "cheating moment" just suddently i dream that i have cheated and my whole world comes crashing down. The nightmare is that i didnt have a chance to stop it i just have the hangover of it.....So after i have stopped drinking i get the same dream about alcohol. I am not dreaming about drinking but just dreaming about waking up and realizing that i got wasted last night. The guilt and remorse i dream is a nightmare. ..The only good thing about those dreams is that i am so happy when i wake up realizing it was just a dream! The alcohol dreams really help me remind my self during the day that if i would fall of the wagon the feelings i dream would become reality.
