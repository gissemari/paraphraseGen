[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy Hump Day! What's Up Wednesdays are when we celebrate our sobriety see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** I am planning a very complicated next couple of months including travel to and from San Francisco as well as a trip on the autotrain from the Adirondacks down to Florida plus several medical procedures for both me and my mother and I am getting it all organized and scheduled. There is no way I could have done this while I was drinking...**Struggle:** When I was a drinker my family members would drink too much and then blame me. They'd say  I only drank too much last night because Mary is here. She is such a bad influence.  Now that I'm sober they still blame me. They say  I only drank too much last night because Mary is here. I know that she is my designated driver so I can drink as much as I want.  *Sigh.*..**General:** I make fresh nectar (one part sugar to four parts water) for my hummingbird feeder and I have the feeder hanging in a window where I can see it from my desk while I'm working. I am getting so that I can identify the individual hummingbirds and am naming them after characters from the British sitcom [ Are You Being Served? ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJRNs_DbncA&amp;list=PLUOxCrDh0oVdzF9o9Pf66QqehEMtR1qlb) Betty Slocombe is the plump female bird who sits on the perch with an imperious air and Mr. Humphries is the pretty slender male with the bright green feathers who nips over to the feeder for a quick drink then zips away..
----------immediate responses--------

Happy Wednesday folks. Have a great day whatever you are doing. I will not drink with you today.   
Happy Wednesday! :) I will not drink with you today...Triumph: that would be getting thus far and going sober at a beer festival last weekend...Struggle: an acquaintance thanked me for a favour by offering to take me to the pub. Part of me thought about going for 1. I know 1 won't work for me though. I already had plans but I'm going to have to be more on guard and mentally prepared with 'nope no way' in my mind. Scared of tomorrow too (12d). My first attempt crashed and burned at 12d so i need to get past this psycholohical road block that I'm going to f-up...General: long term career plans are getting busier; doing a certificate course at night school now (1 night a week) on top of my OU degree &amp; voluntary work experience &amp; p/t job which means i am mega busy but i am so excited to be learning. Its going to be a long road but purposeful. September is always a good month for me; it's like my own personal New Year of new beginnings...Have a peaceful day not drinking everyone. IWNDWYT

* **Triumph**: 12 days of sticking to not drinking today and of eating the keto way a way of eating that really helps my health...* **Struggle**: learning to accept [my family life](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/6xnj2t/huge_dip_i_have_to_make_this_better/) including the disillusionment. Learning to give it and my concerns about loved ones a place between care and letting go...* **General**: Seems 5:30-ish is my new automatic wake-up time. I'm so excited! By 9 a 3rd of my workday is already done while others still have to start. It gives me peace of mind knowing I'm ahead in my work.
People keep inviting me to parties! Avoided one got another invite just now which I've turned down...Been playing some video games but one of the characters was all based around drinking... I couldn't believe it "after we've smashed we'll get smashed" or something like that (Titanfall 2). ..I'm definitely riding a hump! urggghhh. 
I made through the night on my first day! Heavy sweating woke me up several times I mean l like running in the summer heat kind of sweating. This is the first day in years I have woke up with out having a hang over. I have a lunch meeting today in the city at a nice restaurant and will gracefully not drink with them today. Happy Wednesday to you all!
Triumph: my cardio has skyrocketed in the gym and I recover so much faster...struggle: I used to think I sweat so much in the gym because I was always hungover turns out I'm just a sweaty bastard. 
This is my favorite of the weekly threads for both reading and posting. :-) I look forward to checking in throughout the day. Thanks for hosting Mary. Argghh on the family blamers how frustrating. "Sigh" sounds like a good response...Triumph: When sitting in this same spot yesterday morning I listed all that needed to get done in the day ahead and the time each task would take and it seemed impossible. Rearranged and combined a few tasks scheduled them into my calendar and stuck to the plan. Everything critical happened (including self-care--strength training and preparing healthy dinner for my family and me). I had some anxiety throughout the day but managed through it. At the end of the day enjoyed a play with my son as planned (without falling asleep second act due to drinking) came home to read SD and SLEPT WELL. Successful day and night. It's the little things :) ..Struggle: Anxiety and sleep issues extending on-and-off longer than expected. But maybe I just need more time. Worst case by removing alcohol from the equation I can more easily zero in on the source(s) of the issues and work on improving. ..General: Doctor appointment today to discuss sleep anxiety fatigue peri-menopause symptoms (oh joy) weight gain etc. Hoping for some ideas to continue to feel better. If I could just sleep every night like I slept last night I think I could conquer the world :-) ..
Triumph: Visited my GP yesterday and got a referral for a psychiatrist. It's clear now that the meds I've been on for a few years are no longer working and it's time to get my bipolar under control properly so I can live a happy healthy life. Admitting to myself that I need additional help has been a big triumph for me...Struggle: Work lunch today at the pub to celebrate a company milestone. Got a few funny looks and some comments when I ordered a Diet Coke instead of splitting a bottle of wine with some of the girls as usual and spent the rest of lunch trying to politely distance myself from that end of the table...General: Spent this evening doing some painting. I haven't done anything creative in ages so it felt good to sit with a paintbrush in my hand. Now I'm heading to bed clear headed and relatively relaxed. 
Hey Mary I'm wishing you safe travels - and congrats on doing all of this sober! &lt;3..**Triumph:**  I've been hosting bbq's K's adult children stay-over's (due to work) doing Fall decorating and throwing a birthday party for his 26 year old daughter on Saturday. I absolutely adore his family and the quality time that we spend with them. If I was drinking? Nope. None of this would be happening. I'm truly blessed :)...**Struggle:**  The consulting position that I'm negotiating for is not an every-day thing but the main office is about 2 hours away from K's (and I don't even know what the traffic will be like). Trying to balance my life career/travel K my Mom his Mom and family may be a challenge. I'll keep in mind that with sobriety anything is possible ;)...**General:**  I've gone candle-crazy. In preparation for the birthday party this weekend I selected the most gorgeous scents: baked apple crisp pumpkin apple butter woodland trails lakeside and bonfire/camping nights. This morning as we had coffee K smiled and said "I love that you've made this place a "*home*". So true - it's now just not a house but a cozy warm homey sanctuary for the whole family! xo
Cycling up with my friend to visit my grandparents. It's a few miles away looking forward to it and I can guarantee it will beat staying at home just getting drunk. 
Triumph: I'm back home from a week with family! The trip went well - it was the first time going back since my father's funeral. The exciting news is that I will be getting my dad's harpsichord! Making plans for my music room now :-)..Struggle: I'm finding it hard to get back into my routine. When dad died I was imbued with lots of motivation and inspiration and now it's just like well here's the rest of my life. I'm feeling less of a push to make my life the way I want it. One day at a time right?..General: I have a Home Depot gift card burning a hole in my pocket. Planning on repainting my office which will be the music room. Today I'll be sorting through my art supplies and getting the room organized. Then comes painting and moving furniture. I'm a little nervous about this project but I know it will be worth it in the end. 
Triumph: Day 11! On my way to my first ever Leadership Conference for executive chefs. It's usually a booze fest but my General Manager is traveling with me and she has been a HUGE support these past few days...Struggle: My SO of over two years dumped me over the phone on Sunday. It's weighing me down some but I did not drink after the break up. ..General: The past week has been eye opening. I can't help but thinking about all the dumb s*** I did while under the influence. Very proud to be moving past and saying good bye to that way of life...Bon Voyage! I will not drink with you today!
I will not drink with you today!
**Triumph:** I've been struggling with anger--since long before I quit honestly. I re-focused my cognitive behavior therapy and meditation on my anger about a month ago. Now I'm feeling the progress...**Struggle:** I managed to stay productive at work despite hangovers because I focused on a narrow to-do list. Now I go through periods where that doesn't work--distracted pursuing other threads putting out other fires. I'm in one of those periods and struggling to return to productivity on bigger tasks...**General:** A family of blue jays made my yard a central part of their range. It's been fun to see the chicks grow up. They can be annoying punks but also have a fascinating range of behaviors.
My first ten days were a nightmare. I'm actually going pretty strong now. My only regret is that I told one of my colleagues that I've gone sober. Seeing as the entire office had CV. a pretty strong hunch that I had a problem everybody now knows and won't shut up about it. Which I kind of resent. My own fault I guess.  In an attempt to make them think I'm not a fucking I told them that I just decided to go sober until the Christmas party where there'll be an open bar. But honestly I'm planning on not drinking or even not going. ...Next time anyone asks I'll just say "oh yeah that failed.. haha. Got drink with my brother the other day." Nice and nonchalantly so they don't think it's some kind of huge relapse. Fucking love working in an office where everybody's close but sometimes it's a nightmare. Only have myself to blame though I guess.
Triumph: Uh I haven't had a drink in 173 days? I haven't killed my 12 year-old? I don't know it's not obvious what my triumphs are this week really. ..Struggle: Aforementioned 12 year-old. Honorable mention to the 23 year-old who insists on fighting with the 12 year-old. All. The. Time. Also money. My mortgage went up by $130 a month which means I can't afford my house AND my car payment so I have to surrender the car. I bought a beater but of course it needs some work. ..General: I'm going to DC this weekend. I plan on getting a lot of sleep seeing some Smithsonian museums and relaxing with friends. I may not come home. 
Struggle:  I've been pretty happy with my new car. Then opened up the statement today and holy fuck did I get screwed. At first I thought it was a mistake or that they deliberately conned me. Figured out it is this thing called precomputed interest. I'm already on the hook for every penny of the 5 years of interest!  Shit should be illegal. Never finance through a dealer. Anyway....Triumph:  it was nice knowing exactly how I made my mistake and that it wasn't because I was half in the bag or hungover or even foggy from drinking all the time. If I were drinking it would have taken me longer to figure this out and I would have stressed fifty times more and needed several drinks while I tried to figure out how I either got fucked over or fucked up yet again..General: Never finance through the dealer. 
On my 3rd day I feel tired and awful but I'd rather feel this than being hungover! ..I will NOT drink today!
Triumph: We've been working on making picture collages of the things we've done with the grandkids over the summer. It's been a fun project that the kids and my husband got involved with over the weekend. It's one of those things that I would have talked about doing in the past but probably never actually done when I was drinking. ..Struggle: I had a dream last night where I was eating fried chicken and drinking a beer. I know dreams are just dreams and they don't have to mean anything but usually when I have drinking dreams it's more like a nightmare and I have an absolute sense of terror about drinking in them. In this one I had such an indifferent attitude about it like yeah this is happening. ..General: We have a variety of wild life living in the wooded area behind my condo so I throw vegetable scraps out for them usually lettuce for the deer. I was super excited when a family of rabbits started coming around so I chopped up a carrot and threw it out there for them. They never ate them though and my husband was confused why there were bits of carrot in the yard. 
**Triumph:** I feel amazing. This past weekend my sister came and visited I told her that I stopped drinking and she was totally supportive. No iterations of 'I told you so' or any other judgments just support. It made the weekend that much better. ..**Struggle:** Today I'm telling the girl I've been seeing that I don't see us being more than friends. If I'm nice about it I think it'll go well. ..**General:** BoJack Horseman Season 4 drops this Friday! [Hooray!](http://68.media.tumblr.com/53346ceedde5b6d29c0558bb1e932858/tumblr_or91vaey0D1rmp6e8o1_540.gif)
Day 1 here. Sorry if I don't qualify (you'll understand shortly) or get the format wrong...Triumph: it's 10a and I'm not drumbling stunk. Gotta start somewhere right?..Challenge: there's a bunch of beer and boozy soda downstairs in the gaming room from my last (unbelievably boozy) birthday party. I grabbed and cracked a boozy root beer rather than a NA one purely on reflex/habit. I didn't notice until it hit my tongue. I did swallow that swig (no sink down there) but dumped the rest. Going to move the beer fridge to the garage I think...General: I never got hangovers (though I am no stranger to waking up still drunk) so I don't feel any different than "normal"... but I did wake up slightly earlier than I have been. Also video games are a lot easier when you aren't blisteringly drunk...
Wednesday how I love thee!..Triumph:  I made it through Mother's Night Out last night without having one single drink! I feel it will be easier for future MNOs from now on and it makes me very happy...Struggle:  I am still working on how I deal with the stress of parenting and am trying not to be so angry/frustrated/short on patience. The toddler and the husband both make me want to have a drink. But I will not because that just really makes it harder when it's all said and done. ..General:  My self care has really improved. I went to the doctor today and he started me on a liver cleanse to help flush out the pregnancy hormones. It will be awesome if it works as good as he says. I am really looking forward to telling my therapist tomorrow that I quit drinking! Oh and I'm about to go get my hair done!..I'm not drinking with you today!
Triumph: Two weeks today! Landed a new side job making good money...Struggle: I am trying to stay off pot and away from other drugs.
Triumph: today is my first day of university after being out of school for a decade. My ducks are linear and I feel ready to crush some higher education...Struggle: Compared to the rest of the people in my program I am an old guy with weird tattoos and they don't seem to appreciate my 'unique sense of humor'. During orientation there was a group thing and I didn't get picked for a group. It was like high school all over again. What ever the activity was silly anyways...General: going back to school has given me a good excuse to buy my self fancy mechanical pencils. Real fancy. 
I'm so thankful I can check in here everyday...TRIUMPH: Finally started getting my paper work in order to get my nursing license back. I let it expire because I wasn't working...CHALLENGE: I keep having these intrusive thoughts. Almost where I start feeling sorry for myself. I wonder why I can't have a drink or two like other people. I wonder what's wrong with me. ..Then I think what am I really missing out on? NOTHING. I'm actually gaining surprise benefits daily. I can still have conversations and laugh with family/friends and it's 100X better because I'm Sober and my feelings are my own AND I remember everything! ..Happy Wednesday I will not drink with you today!
Triumph: I have had no desire to drink at all since my last fall off the wagon (I had had months sober then the last fall- and I hopefully mean LAST) and have newfound love in crafting and rediscovered how amazing exercise makes me feel..Challenge: people who mean to be helpful are insisting a sobriety path for me I completely disagree with and don't think will work for me- I think I will resent it.  I have set my path and I tend to follow it.  I have support for it and have confidence it will work. No one knows me like I know myself. ..Happy Sober Humpday to all you lovely people! 
**Triumph:** After a bout of sustained practice on the trombone I feel reasonably happy with my standard of playing at the moment...**Struggle:** Just had a client do the dirty on me with slim chance of me getting payment for work I've done. Whilst I know it'll happen occasionally it's still shit when it does...**General:** I always see September as a 'new start' time of year where I can put plans in place for the next 12 months. Then it's head down/ arse up between now and Christmas...
Triumph - good clear headed day at work. Feeling like my mind is just working better each day. .Challenge - after a week of long sleeps I am finding myself buzzing in the evening. I think it will settle..General - husband's birthday tomorrow I have asked if he is OK with me not drinking - he is and has been telling me how well I am doing. That makes me so very happy..I will not drink with you tonight you lovely lively SDers
**Triumph:**  Sunday night I went to my first concert at my favorite local club ... I've never once been there sober.  A few of my old drinking buds as well as my wife were there and while they all drank I was perfectly content not to.  I just ordered my new favorite non-alc drink (tonic and lime) and enjoyed focusing intently on the music (Martin Barre of Jethro Tull... yeah I'm old).  Other than the stench of stale spilled beer it was an awesome evening and instead of getting blitzed staying out 'til 3am and waking up hungover some time the next afternoon feeling like shit I was in bed by midnight and up and out on a bike ride at 9am....**Struggle:** I'm trying to establish healthier boundaries and also release 'control' (that I don't really have anyway) of those around me in particular my wife who I am overly protective of.  ..**General:** "Closed to the public since 1980 the summit of Mount Umunhum will finally open starting Sept 16.  Its name is Ohlone for  resting place of the hummingbird  and it offered a place of prayer for Native Americans."
Made it through a tough day yesterday on my friend's birthday. Woke up to a text from his dad today saying "we're all proud of you". Feels good. I will not be drinking with you today.
**Triumph:** Really stoked about this new job. I used to half-ass every job I had just to keep the job to get paid. This job is making me really want to try and put all my effort into it...**Struggle:** Holy shit I wish people would take training seriously. I get that people love to make jokes and have fun; however it is really annoying to not be able to get through the day's material because someone wants to make a quip about everything...**General:** I'm just really stoked about life. I'm happy to be alive and my depression is almost non-existent. I'm also really grateful for the support that you all give. Yesterday I almost drank but I turned to this sub and I rode out the rest of the day with no alcohol...
T:  Survived Labor day weekend at the lake...S:  My first exam is tomorrow.  We have to get above 80% in order to pass.  I'm having a really hard time concentrating on studying.  ..G:  There's a bunny rabbit that hangs out in the neighbors front yard.  Last night a scary looking guy was walking down the street and the bunny rabbit ran towards my dog and I for protection.  It was kind of funny.  
I used to love watching "Are You Being Served?"  I love the hummingbird characterizations!  I recently got to watch hummingbird moths sip nectar from flowers in a nearby mountain town.  They are amazingly similar to hummingbirds in looks and mannerisms but in all of their moth-y splendor.  Convergent evolution at its best!..**Triumph:**  I pushed myself and my comfort zone to backpack for 4 days with folks who are faster than me in an unfamiliar environment.  I actually met one of my 2017 goals because of this so yay!   It's been a while since I've been the less experienced one in an outdoor setting and it was good for me to learn new things and get inspired by these strong adventurous people...**Struggle:**  I'm wondering if I have some sort of hormonal deficiency.  Even doing the things I love the most (see above) I just don't seem to "feel" it anymore and I have next to no sex drive anymore.  It's frustrating and I feel like I am living in a low level state of depression.  Sobriety has not helped with this.  I loathe going to the doctor but I may need to talk to someone about this.  It's really bringing me down...**General:**  Despite the smoky haze and continued high temperatures there is a slight chill in the morning air these days and I am getting excited for the change of season and cool weather bikes and hikes.
- Triumph: I'm about to sign a 10-month lease that ends next July because I am planning things as if I'll be in a new city getting ready to begin grad school. Let's do this. ..- Struggle: 10-month leases aren't cheap. ..- General: went on my first date since last summer and things went well despite the awkwardness. I'm actually happy that I was awkward as hell since that's my default setting and has been since I was a kid (the alcohol "masked" it "aka made it where I didn't notice it because my senses were dulled)).
Sfgirlmary: Good luck in the next few months hopefully everything works out all hunkyDory! I have two hummingbird feeders at the lake house and they continuous fight over them! Lol.... .Sending much love and happiness your way! ..Triumph: made it to 29 days again tomorrow is the dirty thirty. I have went to the gym more in the past three weeks than any three week stretch since I was in my early twenties (am 32 now). ..Struggle: I still think about drinking in the most inopportune times. I was walking in a trail about three mikes into a five mile hike today and all of a sudden I started thinking about drinking bourbon when I was finished... it came on so quick. I had to catch myself because I noticed my mind had already started rationalizing. I didn't buy the bourbon but how quickly and randomly my mind goes to a thought pattern that leads to obvious self destruction is baffling to say the least...General: I am thankful everyday I am wake up. Thankful for another chance to participate in life. Everyday upon waking I say "Thank you whatever or whoever you are thanks for another day." When I was drinking I would wake up feeling like shit and dread the next day. Sick tired wondering who I called and what I said.... and thankfully gratefully I will never have to do that again. ..Love you SD and keep on keepin' on. ..
Was going really well for 62 days but then I threw it away after the this past weekend. Did a 16 mile run last Saturday and figured I could have some beers for labor day. Turned into a 4 day mess and now I'm back here. Waiting for my flair to reset. IWNDWYT
Triumph: 7 days in a row waking up hangover free knowing EXACTLY where I am and where my pants are. I haven't been sober 7 days straight since I was legal. Was able to navigate a visit from the bf's sister playing sober cab and not partaking. Enjoyed myself while maintaining control...Struggle: My bf also has a drinking problem. He is not trying to be sober. I think he's enjoying the fact I'm always able to drive but that is getting very old very fast.  He is also picking triffling fights which I would angrily indulge at the bottom of the bottle. In fact I'm sitting at my studio right now by myself because he refused to apologize for a delibrately hurtful comment. I smoked a cigarette in the parking lot of my favorite watering hole and instead found myself here trying to deal with the situation instead of getting wasted. I've probably smoked 5 cigarettes lighting one off the other. I need to quit smoking. That isnt happening tonight. Huff...General: I'm back to painting. My house is getting closer to being ready. I have no idea what to get my shit head bf for his birthday Friday.  
I'm checking in here - not drinking today
