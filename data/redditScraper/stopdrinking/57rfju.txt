This was my first relapse with SD and hopefully my last. I made it 39 days then decided to drink Wednesday through Friday. I couldn't shut up that voice in my head. I hate that voice. It makes me feel nuts. I want so badly to be free of the shackles of alcoholism. Here's to trying again. Thank you all for being here.

So glad you're back...Love yourself forgive yourself and let's move forward together. .
[reaches out a helping hand up] Welcome back into the wagon. The ride may be bumpy at first but it does smooth out...After each fall off the wagon I learned something new. What have you learned? What will you do differently next time?
Welcome back.
I'm back too glad to see you here
Im with you.
