This is it! I have had it!.I REALLY want to learn how to live with out alcohol for good..Long story short; I have been drinking for almost 2 decades now the past year heavyly on a dayly basis from dawn to passout and waken till twilight. The damage of my actions/deficientcy of the same seams soooo unrepairable unbearable. .Though that's exactly the mental and emotional stress/shame/guilt-trippin' loop that has driven me back to drinking and kept me in the funk and the pattern that I'm trying to break free from (again) - it's f***'in' hard!.I wish to live although feeling dead inside. I wish to give love although it seems impossiple. I wish to serve although my mind keeps me captured in a delussion of the pasts hurts and the scary future.  .Sobriety must come first -- continuously -- stepstones to damagecontrol and hopefully repair...This is my day 1! (coldturky)..Sorry for the cry-out fellas but I had to get some things of my chest here...Thank you! for sharing your experiences please keep doing that...I now know that i'm not alone on the struggling path to a better livin' and that there are communities of supportive humanbeings...Hopefully with time I will learn more on my path as this foggy clouded view may rise by the suns rays.. Hopefully one day.. One day at a time.....To be continous....
