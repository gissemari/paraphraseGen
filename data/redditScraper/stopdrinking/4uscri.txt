This isn't my first Day 1 but I'm hoping it will be my last. My longest stretch of successful non-drinking was 9 months and recently I managed 3 weeks before convincing myself that moderation was possible (why does that always seem so true despite all the evidence to the contrary??). Even though I'm feeling crummy today and didn't feel like posting anything I wanted to finally stop lurking and say hello since this sub really seems like an excellent community and hopefully a good way to stay accountable. If you don't tell anyone you've quit drinking it's easier to relapse without anyone being the wiser right? Anyway hello!

Hi! I read far more than I post--good stuff here and it's very helpful to check in throughout the day. I won't drink with you!
