Sober. It sounds much longer if you write out the numbers. It's been a struggle but then you hear stories of people losing $400 people losing their wallets people losing their keys jobs wife car life... and it just gets easier. The buffoonery of alcoholism is constantly swept under the rug of society and I applaud everyone that realizes this and chooses not to drink...Thanks for the mutual support y'all.

'Love this the Buffoonery of Alcoholism!  I'm stealin' this. 
Congratulations! Keep it up!..My goal is to stay sober until at least age 76 so I will have a run of sobriety as long as drinking..If I make 76 I will MAYBE consider trying again to drink again (but probably not).
Are you Mr. Wendell? Going to Tennessee? 
Congrats!!! That is amazing!
