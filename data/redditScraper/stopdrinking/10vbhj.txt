Hey everyone it's Wednesday that means the week's half over! How's it been going? Share your triumphs struggles or just general chat!..Triumph: I've been working with my sponsor and really enjoying it.  He's a great guy with years of sobriety so hopefully I'll learn a lot.  I'm realizing everyday that good sobriety takes work.  But I want to do the work so bad...Struggle: Going to a lot of meetings and it's starting to wear me out.  I'm doing 7 - 8 a week.  I think I need to start bringing it down to 5 - 6 so I have time to do other things as well...General chat: My cold is finally gone!..Have another great 24 hours folks!

T: Not sure what to put this week. I know I had many triumphs but just can't think of any now. Anyway I'm still here and that's good enough for me...S: Realizing how addictive my personality truly is. Don't know how to control it only know how to refocus it...GC: Going to [freefest](http://virginmobilelive.com/freefest/line-up) this weekened. I am incredibly pumped. I also printed out the game [Cards Against Humanity](http://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com/). Cutting all those game pieces out has been quite the process.

T: Beat several cravings to drink this week. That's about it. Been kind of boring around here. ..S: Been really sad for no apparent reason and I think because of the weather change I've been battling the sniffles for the last two weeks. ..GC: Going to a taco party this weekend. I am going to eat all the tacos. And then throw up because I ate too many tacos not because I drank too much!
Finally got my ass to a meeting again then another and another. In a real good place now.
Triumph: Almost to 30 days for the first time in my damn life...Struggle: I still have strong desires to go hide in a closet with a pack of smokes and an 18 pack...GC: I signed up for a running race on Sunday morning which is a reward for me and I am excited to do it.  ..Be nice to yourself people.

Triumph: Today I'm sober and being honest with myself and others...Struggle: I relapsed the weekend before last. I need to reset my badge but keep forgetting. I wasn't being honest with myself about some things I was feeling thinking and doing and ended up drinking for pretty much 3 days straight before I called my sponsor and told him what was going on. I'm done this time. I ultimately think I drank because I was overwhelmingly depressed. I still am. I'm an unemployed student and am trying to find a way to get back on my medication without going broke. I'm going to have to go through the county mental health services which I had too much pride to do before but right now I'm willing to do anything. Even though I feel like I want to die I've been here before and I know that thought is a lie. It's just exhausting to keep fighting it. The only way I know to make it go away for a little while is with alcohol but that doesn't really work any more either. ..General chit chat: I have a test today that I couldn't find any motivation to study for.  No bueno.
Triumph: Made it through an emotionally draining week one determined as ever. Got a sweet deal on a sick bike yesterday that will be clutch in getting my ass to the gym early twice a week. ..Struggle: trying to find enough hours in the day to fulfill my commitments to job school friends sobriety and myself. I'm pretty sure there are some extras located at the beginning of the day but I've never been privvy to those.... I'll get 'em dang it!..Chit Chat: First day of MBA classes! let's do this! 
Triumph:  I'm sober today.  Also in the past 45 days I've gone down two waist sizes in pants and lost nearly two inches around my middle.  In the past few months I've gone from struggling to walk a couple of miles to running between 3.5 - 5 miles (that's 6 - 8 km Victoria) every other day...Struggle:  I don't have any clothes that fit me any more.  Gotta get some new ones.  And I think I've properly fucked my right foot somehow so no running for a couple of days...General chat:  It's been proposed that bluefin tuna be added to the endangered species list.  About goddam time says I.
Triumph: Attended first AA meeting ever.  Got my one month coin and spoken to by strangers it was interesting...Struggle: Trying to stay content with things as they come to me easier said than done.  My motto is slowly becoming a regulated exhale followed by a somewhat understanding "whatever."..General chat: My cat has been rather ill for weeks now and I'm not sure how much longer he's going to make it.  He simply won't eat or drink anything.  I've been trying all sorts of foods but the only thing he'll regularly eat is yogurt.  I try to sit with him and make sure he is comfortable for the most part.  I also don't think he sleeps like he should.  Has anyone dealt with this before?  How do you nurse a cat back to health?  What is nutritious for cats and what will he eat?  Just wondering if anyone has any advice.

Triumph: Got 90 days today and in a week will have the longest period of sobriety since I was 15. ..Struggle: My body is sore as hell from joining crossfit and running two miles for the first time ever yesterday. (Okay not really a struggle). But I have had to deal with getting over myself and my mental image of where I should be in life and change some goals to be more realistic. ..General Chat: You are all awesome and I couldn't have gotten this far without you...Keep being awesome!
Triumphs: Was able to open the fridge see my roommate's beer and barely blink. Went to a bar for a show and didn't even consider buying a pint...Struggle: Having an acquaintance sit next to me at the show with a bourbon on the rocks and have him waft his boozy air/breathe in my face. (he has no idea)..General chat: I've decided to use jogging as a good way to get high on life. Jogged 2.5km/1.5mi and I felt great afterwards. I just started running and it was probably the first time I've ran for fun/exercise in close to 10 years. It was kind of pathetic how short of a jog it was but the runner's high kept me going through the night and I was motivated enough to make dinner and do two loads of laundry while watching some netflix.
Hi guys and gals!..Triumph this week: Been losing weight since a few weeks after I stopped drinking now down 30+ pounds and can wear everything I wore in college. 10 more pounds and I'll be done. I do NOT miss those extra calories from alcohol!..Struggle: Trying to figure out how to forgive someone I love for making a stupid mistake that impacted me a bit financially. I really need to let go of those feelings and learn to be more forgiving... it's hard though. ..General Chat: I've been playing the latest Warcraft expansion... it's awesome! Hope you all are having a lovely day.

Howdy all... Good to read everyone's successes! As for me:..Triumph: Had a good time with family over the weekend helping an elder relative sort out some problems. So glad I wasn't worried about where to hide bottles like previous times...Struggle: Case of the blues this week. Trying to get motivated to make a decision and getting in my own way. (Irrational fear is a MFer). Working through it as best I can.

Triumph:  Another week down and I'm closing in on one month really quickly.  I don't even think about the casual weekday evening drinks that I thought I would miss for a long time.  Gatorade is doing the trick just fine...Struggle:  School and work are kicking my ass lately.  Fortunately I'm not 'dealing with it' by saying fuck it and getting drunk.  Instead I'm taking a step back and re-planning my time so I can get everything done...General chat:  I have next week completely off of work and school.  I'm concerned about how much free time I will have and the fact that I won't have to wake up early any of those days.  I don't want this lack of external responsibilities to lead me astray.  Before this weekend is over I am going to make a schedule of all the things I want and need to do every day so that I have plenty to keep me occupied.
...Triumph: just turned down my first uni bar invitation EVER feelin' mighty fine..Struggle: meeting overload skipped two day NOT  a good idea for me again..General chat: loveing this Wednesday post man good work NMBP..
