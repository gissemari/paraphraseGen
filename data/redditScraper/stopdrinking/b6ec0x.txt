Hey guys! Who is up? If I have a tag remove it. I've only been sober since Monday...I made the decision with my family after multiple relapses and crippling psychiatric issues to check into an inpatient rehab facility in Memphis. I fly out of Jacksonville in the early morning. I'm nervous about the detox process because I'm also addicted to klonipin. ..Anyone have any experiences they want to share with inpatient rehab? I'm scared out of my mind. 30 days without devices away from home...Thanks guys and lets not drink tonight.

I also am going to rehab tomorrow. I'm scared shitless. But at least somebody else is going through the same thing as me tomorrow. Safe travels.
Good for you! Let them take care of you. I can only imagine the relief from all the weird compulsive decision-making we engage in when we are drinking/using. Good luck to you!
That's sounds terrifying. I can't imagine. ..You're stronger than I. 
I've been to detox a few times and rehab once (almost half a year ago). It's scary as hell to even think about it. Withdrawals were uncomfortable (even medicated) for me the first day but after that I started feeling like myself again. The meds they give you help with any potential seizures or other fatal complications. Just be 100% honest with how much you were drinking and how much Klonopin you were taking they should adjust your detox meds accordingly.  As a phone addicted millennial I didn't miss social media and my phone as much as I thought I would  it was pretty freeing. I met some of the greatest people in my rehab but also keep in mind that some people really don't want to be there and will be negative and try to bring those around them down. Use this time to fee all the feelings guilt shame embarrassment and why maybe you became addicted in the first place (underlying issues). As someone who kicked and screamed the whole way to rehab and fought tooth and nail I got a lot out of it and it saved my life. You got this 
I did 30 days of inpatient rehab at a place called Caron.  It was fun as hell tbh.  I begrudgingly went but by the end of the first day I was glad I went.  It really reminded me of college minus all the drugs and alcohol.  
Inpatient is okay. So okay I did it twice! Lol..No really but looking back it was a really *different* experience. Almost high school like in some ways with the schedule cafeteria little socializing little friend making etc...But my advice is this:..You know you're going to suffer sleeplessness because of detoxing. But it's also physically uncomfortable and **loud** at night in those facilities not to mention them popping in to check your vitals every 30 min.  ..Little things to help increase the odds of sleeping are huge...Bring your own pillow. A lot of these places house suicidal people so everything is wrapped in thick vinyl and **firm** like old football equipment. ..Earplugs! I left them in almost all the time just because the place was so busy and distracting. ..Other than that it was really not that bad imo. The food was better than decent.
