Hey SD! ..Just wanted to post today and express my gratitude here! Yesterday I received a 7 month chip from an AA group that I attend regularly and I was asked to reflect on how I did it. Really I still struggle on a daily basis trying to stay sober; however it is much more manageable when I focus on 24 hours at a time (sometimes I have to take it one hour or one minute at a time) to stay away from that first drink. ..I also spend a lot of time reading SD and gathering some experience strength and hope from your posts here. If I'm feeling low and when the pink cloud has faded I come here to be reminded why I'm doing this. ..Today I get the choice to get better. And I can get [better because I'm not dead yet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB4Avdlz3lk). ..Thanks SD for the 216 twenty-fours and for this moment right now. You help me become a better person everyday. ..Here's to not drinking today and thinking about tomorrow tomorrow.
