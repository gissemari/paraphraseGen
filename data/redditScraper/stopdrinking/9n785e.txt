On June 26th I puked on myself in my car on my way home from the hospital. I had to pull over several times. I got home and said to myself like I'd said a thousand times before this is my last bottle. That bottle was my last. The first few weeks were so rough but now after only three months I have reaped so many benefits and I now have way too much to lose. I don't ever ever want to go back to that darkness ever again. I will keep coming back here for support because I know this will be a struggle my whole life.

Hello my friend Very well done on your 105 days...I called alcohol the great remover. It took money health self respect job drivers licence hope etc...It gave me debt hangovers a gutter to sleep in criminal history ..But today the tables have turned...Sobriety gives me what I sought in alcohol and a lot more...Thank you. Your Friend in sobriety John..        
 good job.  Keep going. 
Congratulations. That's awesome. It gives me hope. IWNDWYT.
We're you doing a lot of exercise and nutrition as well? Losing weight was one of the big motivators for me but I've heard pretty mixed experiences here and in other forums.
How did this happen to you..It's all YOU. Plain and simple. You made a decision to better your life. You put the effort in. You trusted yourself. You were ready. It's not easy...not for anyone. But your post will inspire others to keep trying regardless of setbacks. There's always hope and you're an inspiration. Congrats on 100 days!
very cool
