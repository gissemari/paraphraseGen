I'm 26 and it feels like life should be more fun. Over the past two years I've gotten a strong circle of friends in AA my only friends really and now the camaraderie is nearly gone from our group. All of us have gotten busy with relationships jobs location changes or left AA etc. Personally I've been using work as an excuse not to go to meetings. I'm tired of it. I can't wait to leave the meeting as soon as I arrive. It seems like whenever I show up all people talk to me about is how little I go anymore. ..I haven't been able to have a lasting physical relationship since I've gotten sober but that isn't so different from when I was drunk all the time. Basically my mind is everywhere and I want to use a combination of reasons to be done with AA and try drinking again. But man not getting a girlfriend or some type of relationship going just eats at my core. I feel like I should be done with AA and try moderation even if the evidence says that won't work. Just to get to the bars and meet someone get any sort of horrible relationship going. Something might be better than nothing. ..It was my decision to get sober and my decision to go to rehab. Very few times did anyone note my problem with drinking and many people were surprised by my decision to get sober. I was very stealthy about it usually drinking by myself in my apartment no roommates. I live in a house with a roommate now who's also in AA and so frankly the people around me still in AA are a big reason why I haven't drank yet. When I talk to my sponsor about this stuff he basically says to try harder and that I need a better higher power. One of my other friends says I was using the camaraderie of the group as my higher power he probably has a point there...I don't know what I'm doing anymore. I needed a place to vent and I haven't been here since I first started thinking about sobering up. In any case thanks for reading and if you have any words of wisdom I'm all ears.

I date a lot (OKCupid Match Tinder) and most girls don't notice or ask what I'm drinking. Eventually I say that I'm not a drinker and most of the time they think it's really cool. Just like in a real relationship you have to have confidence about yourself and who you are. Staying sober is a good test of this.
Wow - I could have written this same post back in 1996. I was 25 lived in a dry house and went to AA every day. I had been sober 2 years. I started to really get pissed off with the meetings because it just didn't feel right for me anymore. I drank and it took me almost a decade to quit again - it was a fucking miserable existence and it is a miracle how I survived it. ..I've come to understand that when my life becomes uncomfortable and it lasts more than a couple of days it is a sign that I need to change something. It means I'm off-track and I need to get on-track. You need to find a way to make AA work for you again or choose a different path. ..You are a turning point in your new life - one road leads back to your old life and one to an even better future. I've consistently found that fixing the problem rather than running away from it (i.e. by drinking again) always leads to significant improvements in my life. This could be a great opportunity for you if you handle it right. 
You know...you don't have to quit AA in order to go back out drinking. There are plenty of folk still drinking in AA. And there are a ton of folk who don't drink are alcoholic and don't go to AA. ..AA might seem like the common thread in all these people staying sober. But the decision to stay sober one day at a time remains within YOU. ..People's attendance at meetings comes and goes. Mine certainly has. Have you ever tried traditional therapy to help you with the relationship issues you're having? ..You want to drink because life isn't going your way. ..Screw what everyone says about why you're feeling this way and higher power this and that...what do YOU want from life right now?..It sounds like you're giving power to everyone else in your life. You're only sober because AA and AA roommates. But it's YOU...Sounds like it's time to try something new. Join a gym. Start rock climbing at an indoor course. Go mini-putting. Hang out at a coffee shop and give a cute girl your phone number.
Have you tried online dating volunteer work getting involved with community clubs dance lessons church jor joining a gym? These are ways to meet people. I'm sorry you are so lonely and hope you find what you're looking for. I doubt that drinking is going to produce good results however. ..That disease troll alcoholism is filling your head with nonsense. ..Take care of yourself and a big **BRAVO** for 949 days sober.
a fellow 26 year old here as well. I know that feeling of loneliness it sucks. I recently just got in a relationship. I was in a massive funk. It was awful but a horrible relationship isn't worse than no relationship. AA I stopped going after day 2. Couldn't stand it. I figured if I was getting sober it was me doing it. No offense to anyone who goes to AA. It's your call if you want to try moderation. Thats everyone's question to me "do you think you'll ever be able to handle drinking socially at some point?" I don't know and I don't think for myself giving it a try is a smart choice. People like the sober me I like the sober me. The best relationship I developed since getting sober is with myself. 
I read your whole post and I can certainly identify.  I had 16.5 years before going back out and drinking again.  I needed to do those experiments because I wanted to learn more about me and my disease and my relationship with alcohol.  I don't regret anything...I'm not going to try and convince you not to drink because I'm honestly glad I drank again.  I wish some of the bad stuff hadn't happened but I'm very happy I made the choices I did.  This is my life and I'm living and learning about it.  I don't want anyone to tell me what to do and honestly I may go back out in the future - I don't know.  I'm just enjoying being sober now...It's strange to me but for some reason my mind seems to remember all the good times of drinking and seems to easily forget the bad times.  I mean I completely forget about waking up not remembering anything and then being really scared to look at my text logs PMs here on reddit FB posts phone call logs....all that shit.  Other times I would have to call in sick because I was too fucking hung over to make it to work.  ..I still remember that feeling of embarrassment about things I did when I was drinking that I never did when I was sober.  Ugh....cringeworthy shit but I honestly have to struggle to remember that shit when I'm thinking about drinking.  The good times - easy...I remember that shit with the quickness but not the bad times...Anyways I just noticed I passed 2 months sober and honestly I'm glad I'm sober now.  I'm rediscovering things that interest me and it's a fun journey.  I keep thinking how nice it is to not drink because I can do anything I want after work - literally anything.  When I'm drinking my choices are severely limited...Do what you feel you need to do and remember you don't lose anything when you go back out....only a number.  You take with you all of the wisdom you've learned in AA. You can still have some of the friendships (don't be surprised if many of your AA friends stop calling/texting/etc when you go back out)...AND NEVER EVER FORGET - YOU ARE ALWAYS WELCOME IN AA SO if you go back out and find that you need help please don't be afraid to ask for help again.  ..Anyways IMO life is meant to be lived and sometimes that living is quite messy - other times not so much.  For now being sober is more appealing to me than being drunk so I'll stay sober for the time being and worry about tomorrow when it gets here.  ..Good luck to you whatever you decide.
Two things...Lots of people go out at the 2-3 year mark...Being sober isn't enough. Eventually if you are unsatisfied with your life the shit just starts eating at you...I nearly went back out for a variety of reasons at 2-3 years. I had to change meetings change sponsors and change my whole philosophy for life. Take is massively easier on myself...It sounds like when you got sober you left yourself a long-term out. Now you are being confronted by it and it's drink or not drink. I don't hear you saying you are looking forward to drinking. I hear you despairing about your life as it is. Drinking wont make it better. The people you see out there drinking moderately and having a great time... the alcohol coursing through them is not what is making them happy. That's your brain craving alcohol and projecting shit onto them...Anyways...Second thing...I went my first four and a half years of sobriety without even getting as far as kissing someone. Some of that was my fault. For me it was not a valid reason to go out and drink. It just isn't. ..Eventually I took the plunge and tried online dating. Took three months but I found someone that I really enjoy spending time with who appreciates my sobriety...I have a couple other things I could say... I know how you are feeling and I sympathize but I would politely suggest you to take a long-hard look at your cravings. What you are going through is completely normal and the odds are stacked against you in terms of staying sober. AA or no AA steps or no steps SD or no SD... keep venting keep being honest keep searching for the bottom of this reservation you have. 
When I have been stuck or low I have found release in my art and in taking my AA up a notch.  Get a sponsee give back or volunteer ( and it does not have to be AA) at a prison a soup kitchen a literacy program...**My dog is my higher power get a dog** - that will keep your sponsor speechless for a few minutes.  Find another sponsor.  when did you last go to an AA dance? ..We both know drinking has nothing for you.  Stop staring down that hole.  
Sounds like you realize drinking again won't work and we're all here to remind you that drinking again won't work.   In fact I promise you that it will bring you to a level of pain and anguish that you never knew existed (I've been there)...As far as what to do next instead all I have for you is cliches but they are cliches for a reason - they work.   Go for what excites you.   You are young and the world is huge.   Your life does not have to consist of Wake Up - Shower - Job - Meeting - Sit Around Apartment With Same Old People - Sleep.   Alcohol used to hold you down and now it's gone so you are free to do anything.   Move to a new state change jobs change careers start a business learn new skills get new hobbies you name it...You deserve a good life.   Booze will bring you misery and a slow death.  If you think you're depressed get meds.   If not take a chance on something that might bring you happiness.   Good luck.
You sound exactly like me at about a year-and-a-half sober. I felt myself drifting and resenting AA and thinking how boring stuff was. I got really into service work in particular speaking. I found myself at treatment centers at detoxes and at prisons a few times a month and it really helped me recenter myself. My disease is progressive and sneaky as hell and it will tell me I can stop doing what worked before because "I got this." That is a slippery slope. My words of wisdom can be summed up as such:.."Service. Service. Service."
If you are anything like me you know deep down moderation doesn't work. I bet you have tried it in the past. ..Come join us in the chat if online support might help...And please keep on venting.
