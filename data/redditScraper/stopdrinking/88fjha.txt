Noo it's a trap! Leave that Tequila right there in the bottle where it belongs eh.... Bloody revolting stuff that it is......Incidentally when I was a barman I once served Tequila to a pair of very drunk Welsh carpet-fitters whose party trick was to snort lines of salt off the bar then rub the slices of lemon into their eyes.... It was quite the spectacle though an unedifying one all round really.... Hehe.....Stay strong Drysfire you're doing great!..IWNDWYT ..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Really even when I used to drink (like 6 days agos) I always dreaded Tequila. That stuff is nasty. Stay away yo!
