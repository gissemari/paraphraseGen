Went through rehab 30+ days sober and relapsed twice trying to be sneaky. SO was ready to leave with our child if I drank more after being caught. I have lost trust and not doing any outside activities. I'm extremely unmotivated and depressed.  Maybe something to go to everyday will help but I hate leaving the house!

Excuse my ignorance but what is IOP?
A child is worth going to outpatient treatment. 
I just got out of inpatient treatment yesterday. Best decision I've ever made.
