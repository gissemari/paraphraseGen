I read somewhere maybe here Day One or One More Day.  I'm tired of Day One's.  After reading This Naked Mind something clicked and I had four solid months of sobriety and messed that up in October for all the self-serving and deluding reasons that alcohol serves up.  'Job sucks kids are stressful you deserve it life's boring without me' on and on and on.  This community was instrumental in helping me stay sober and so I'm back to read and contribute and realize I'm never above relapse.  I owe this to myself my children my girlfriend.  IWNDWYT

I needed support to maintain sobriety because I had no clue how to build a sober happy life on my own. A therapist treatment psychiatry and AA gave me the tools I needed. ..Maybe you need more support. 
I think this place is massively going to help me ! All the best  
Mate I spent 1.5 years straight in day 1.... it's horrible. I'm honestly not sure what changed. Perhaps someone said something in an AA meeting that I needed to hear. Keep searching!

Day one is infinitely better than Day zero. Because it means you've decided to fight back. You faced the devil and told him you won't go down without a holy war. Be proud. You're strong. You can do this. You've done it before and you'll do it again.
