*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*. .**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**. .I'm pledging myself to not drinking today and invite you to do the same.. .Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.. .It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours let's not drink alcohol!. .---. .**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!. .What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up.. .**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.. .**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.. .---. .This post goes up at:. .    US - Night/Early Morning  .    Europe - Morning  .    Asia and Australia - Evening/Night..A link to the current Daily Check-In post  can always be found near the top of the sidebar...---..Wow the Sunday check-in was awesome! My inbox has never been so popular :P. I enjoyed hearing about what you are all going through and how your weekends were. I'm also happy to see so many people that were sober throughout the whole thing despite some rough times (for some people)...I'm not too excited about working but I love making the money and it's also nice to get out of the house but the weekends always feel so short! I hope this week at work keeps me busy because sometimes the days can seem to drag quite a bit. I do know that after work will fly by though I have a service position for two meetings one on Monday and one on Friday. I also meet with my sponsor after the Monday meeting and work on the steps. After all of that and working out it's not too far from time for bed!..Since it's Monday what are your goals for the week starting off? Is it to make it through sober one day at a time? Is it to find a new job? Maybe start a new habit??? I think my goal is to remain in good spirits not let the constant going tire me out too much mentally (my addict behavior is to throw a pity party and try to use that as a reason to get loaded) and remain sober. I believe that's a reasonable goal and I would also like to study to get my CCNA certification each night. We will see how I do :) but I think it's important to push ourselves to do better especially since now that we are sober we have more time. It can be really easy to get complacent and for me that has led to relapse more than once!..I will not drink with you today guys and gals :). Tell me what's going on and I'll work hard to respond to as many as I can! It might be a little hard with work and all the stuff but I will do my best. I'll probably be on later at night Pacific time but I do have my phone and will keep an eye on this :). Have a great sober Monday!
----------immediate responses--------

Not drinking today 
Not drinking today!
Been feeling particularly lonely lately but trying to fill my time with positive things like reading and exercise. Drinking won't help any of that but its easy to idealize how easy it is to meet people in a bar/drinking setting...I will not drink today!
Seeing my therapist for the first time in 3 weeks I will not drink with you all today
I will not drink with you today. Happy Monday everyone.
I will not drink today.
No drinking today or the next 24 hrs!
I back after relapsing need to change my outlook and behaviours. I will not drink with you today 
I didn't drink this week end so of course I won't today.
I just reached my first month sober and I honestly cannot remember the last time I haven't touched alcohol for this long. I'm thankful to this community for its amazing support and I'll make sure to write later a proper post about this first month...I will not drink with you all today.
Monday is no drinking for me
Not drinking today! My goal for this week is to stop using my phone in bed/before I go to sleep (even browsing SD). I'll read some books instead! Going to charge my phone on the other side of the room. 
I will not drink today 
Not today. 
I'm in. Not drinking with you all today. Have a great Monday fellow sobernauts..:-)
Keep me sober today!  Grateful to be here.
I will not drink today
This week I'm going to explore the possibilities and nuances of trying to start your own business. Still very much a pipe dream at this point but might be worth finding out what the building blocks even look like. None of this intrigue or excitement would have ever existed in drinking me but sober me is loving it. I will not be drinking with you today! 
I will not drink today. Day 3! 
I will not drink today.
I will not drink today. 
I will not drink today!
I will not drink today.
Today marks my longest length of sobriety (other than pregnancies) I won't be drinking today!
I will not drink today. I saw a VW van yesterday with two bikes attached and had a little dream of freedom but for now I have to go to work. My supervisor is an overwhelmed man who doesn't like me much and I believe he is an alcoholic. Luckily I spend most of my time on the road and we don't have much contact or I probably would have left by now. The sunrise is absolutely stunning this morning - I'll keep that in the front of my mind all day.
I will not drink with you today.
Ignore the badge i need a reset but i am not drinking today.
Life is getting bumpy lately with lots of things forcing me to test my new tools for coping and sobriety. So far they have proved reliable so today I will not drink that first drink :)
Having the second eye surgery this morning for the Narrow Angle Glaucoma diagnosis from 3 weeks ago. I am not nearly as nervous as I was for the first one. I will spend today as comfortable as possible relaxing and not drinking!
The day got off to a bad start (work again) but I'm not going to drink today.
I will not drink today!
Day off from work and I'm up at 0430 with hip/back pain. I will not drink today no matter what.
I'm not drinking today no matter what!
I will not drink today.  Thanks SD.
Today is day 1. I am a ball of anxiety and I feel like I am going to explode but if I don't make a change now I'm going to wind up in a much worse place. 
I will not drink today
Not today Satan not today!
Just about to leave work and this is when I drop in to the liquor store for my bottle of wine. I will drive past tonight and not drink today.
Not drinking with you today but trying to get the courage to head off to my second AA meeting this morning.  
Good morning all. I shall join you in not drinking today.
I will not drink today.
Concert was awesome last night plenty of flamethrowers and headbanging.  I'm worn out and still have a flight and work ahead of me but happy I'm not hungover on top of all of that!  I will not drink today!
Just hit two weeks and I feel amazing physically and mentally.  I am losing weight and building muscle faster than ever and I feel completely in control and empowered.  My goals for the week are to stay focused and make it through two concerts multiple boat days on the lake and the fourth of July without having a drop.  I am not sure I ever would have found the strength and encouragement to do this without this sub...so thanks SD!  I will not drink with you today.
Woke up at 4:30am not being able to breathe out of my nose at all and have been awake ever since. Today is going to be a long and brutal one with my kids. Wish I could take a nap at some point but that won't happen. I will not drink on this lame-ass day. 
I will not drink today.
Good morning SD! I will not drink today no matter what happens good or bad.
I'm not drinking today. No.
I will not drink today.
I will not drink today.
I will not drink today! 
My cat woke me up at 4:45. I will be exhausted at work all day but probably less so than if I had spent the weekend drinking! Not drinking with you all today!
I loved hosting the DCI as well r/ChrispyChris92 its so motivating seeing all the support on here. ..This week I am finally going to sit down and face the debt that I have been trying for ignore for the last couple of years. I feel strong enough now to deal with it and hopefully get something in place. I am also wanting to start regular meditation so I am going to try and implement that into my daily life...One things for sure though. .I wont be drinking today :).
Working towards my third week! :) just going day by day I won't be drinking with you all today!!!
Not drinking today
I will not be drinking with you on this sunny Monday.  Monday?  Yikes. Sure came quickly.  Have a great day. Don't let the bastards grind you down. 
Due to my work schedule Mondays are always one of my days off. In the past I usually started drinking my wine around 11 am so I could sober up by dinner and prepare for work. I never accomplished anything around the house other then laundry. I would overeat and be frustrated that I have accomplished nothing on my days off other then drinking and hating my job. Today may be a bit of a struggle. I might have some cravings later so I have made some plans. I am going to a spin class at noon. I have given myself a 100 budget to do some internet shopping ( I don't want to be out and about today in driving distance to  wine stores) I have dinner planned and I'm meeting my adult daughter for a yoga class in the early evening. I'm being kind to myself today I am not expecting myself to tackle a closet or do some massive unpleasant job around the house. I don't think it is motivating to do something unpleasant in order to avoid alcohol. So on to Day 4  I will. To drink today.
I'm not going to drink today no matter what! 
I will not drink with you today!.
One week!  I will not drink today.
Hell no I'm not drinking today!
I will not drink today. My goal for this week is to make decent progress on the book I am writing. I reserved a "quiet room" at the library this afternoon so I can work without distractions.

Not be drinking today fo sho! 
Not drinking today. Desperately trying to make amends with my best friend after apparently shouting at her on Friday night. I say apparently not because I don't trust her but because I blacked out. I can't remember anything...She likened me to an abusive ex of hers. Which terrifies me. I grew up with an emotionally abusive dad and I have spent so long trying not to be him.
Awwwww yeaaaaa another sober day here. I've been eating so much healthier (among many other new positive habits). Last night I made braised baby back ribs (with apple juice instead of beer - just as good) with homemade bbq sauce from the braising liquid along with roasted sweet potatoes steamed kale with balsamic and brown rice. ..That was a pretty great end of a pretty great day for me. I will not drink with you today. 
I will not drink today. 
Good morning S/D. It's gorgeous here today. No humidity not going to get above 75. Which means I HAVE to tackle the jungle...I mean garden when I get home. Ah well. ..Day 101. Onwards to 150. 
I will not drink with you today!.
I shall not drink today.  I am tired and sore and want the pain to go away (been moving all weekend) but I will not take a drink to mask the pain.  gonna be hard to stay awake today though me thinks...I shall not drink today...--FTZ--
Good morning! Chris those are some great goals for the week and I hope all your meetings go well! I want to remain in good spirits too; it hasn't been the best month for me but I'm trying. My goal this week is to redo my front flowerbeds working with a landscaping company so it looks more appealing to buyers (trying to sell) set up a few open houses and cross my fingers for a buyer. My life is stalled for the moment until my house sells and instead of pointing fingers blaming my realtor the construction around me or the market stay upbeat and keep telling myself it will happen eventually. Have a great Monday everyone!
last few days have been tough. felt alienated at a friend's bbq even though everyone was very nice. .lot of thoughts. old stuff being processed and it never seems do be done processing it feels like i'm moving in circles..but my badge moves forward which I must be moving forward..I will not drink with you today.  .
This is my first post here. Day 8 - I will not drink with you today. This morning I did a 5:30 am workout (I hadn't worked out in years) and I'm so optimistic about a future without alcohol and becoming healthier. I hope this momentum keeps up! Thanks to all of you for posting your stories. I have been reading them for awhile. You are my inspiration! 
I will not drink today.
I will not drink with you today.
I will not drink today!
I will not drink with you tonight.  I was pretty much handed a job and allowed to make my own schedule with a previous employer.  I just turned in my application.  I have some additional paperwork to take in and also my alcohol eval today.  I mentioned several times that I am missing my son's birthday (today).  I'm throwing a bit of a pity party but only serving sushi and salad at it.  I have yard work to do this afternoon although I may end up just watching television.  I'm thankful for the support from my ex my friends/family and everyone here.  Today WILL be day six.
I have no idea what will happen with my job today but I will not drink today either way! 
I won't drink today
I will not drink today.
I will not drink today.

i've got coffee in hand and i'm ready to not drink today!
Not drinking with you all today  happy Monday
I start working on my boss' book. I'm just reading today but it's a great change of pace. Also I'm getting my tattoo tomorrow! I'm so excited!..I will stay busy at work I will stay busy after work and I will not drink with y'all today!
I woke up this morning exhausted. I'm still tired. I dunno if today is gonna work out...I woke up to my biceps hurting. This has happened before. I fucked up my arms lifting weights yesterday apparently. Great...Finish up my shower and head down to my car. I have a notification saying my trunk is open...And then I realize my Sirius radio isn't there. Or my headphones. Or my CD book. Someone stole it. Yay...Today is a shit day already. I don't know if it can possibly get worse unless I'm like fired or something. Which wouldn't be surprising as I feel like my work performance has been shitty lately...I don't know if I wanted to actually get anything out of this post. I just need to vent. The world sucks and right now on this Monday I fucking hate everything about it.
I made it through the weekend! I was worried considering the circumstances (wife out of town just me and the kids with them going to sleep by 8pm and me there in a house with alcohol available). But I did it. I lost some more weight. Feeling good! I will not drink with you today.
Not drinking with you all today! Feels so good to wake up not hungover! Going to hit the gym extra hard today. 
I will not drink today.
Stating a three day juice cleanse - I certainly won't drink any booze today!  Happy Monday! 
Not drinking today!
Good morning. Not drinking today.
I will not drink today. 
I will not drink today!!
I will not drink today..
Thanks for hosting /u/ChrispyChris92!  I will not be drinking today.  I've got a busy day at work AA meeting at noon and then a volunteer meeting tonight.  This week I'm going to focus on catching up at work and looking for a sponsor so I can continue my step work.
Hit 30 days.  Feeling spectacular.  This morning is a prime example of why it's fantastic.  Woke up early.  Feeling Good!!!  Cleaned up caught up on the news.  Coffee.  Meditation.  Now catching up with you good folks.  Some work today with my head in the game later the gym tonight I'm cooking and look forward to intelligent conversation with family and friends who are really liking the person I am.  Because when I drink I become an entirely different unatractive soul.  
I've made it a week.  I don't remember the last time that happened.  I feel pretty damn good and finally got over that sinus infection.  I won't drink with you all today.
I will not drink today. 
I will not drink today!
I am not drinking today.
Not today!  
Day 10. Not drinking today. Thanks!
  FTZ!
Woke up today with a pounding sinus headache from a 30 degree temperature swing outside which sucks but I can't even imagine how badly my head would be hurting if I had been drinking on top of that...I will not drink today!

Long day of work ahead of me. Good more opportunity to grow as a person and work on a positive attitude while I make money to buy books tattoos and support my family. I will not drink today!
This week will be challenging for many reasons but I won't drink because that won't make it easier. 
I will not drink today.
I will not drink today.
I will not drink today. It's a beautiful rainy day. Glad the weekend is over because without my usual childcare obligations my mind was going haywire. I didn't have a specific urge to drink but had the urge to do SOMEthing. Yesterday I drove around for an hour just figuring out where I wanted to eat. Had a great prime rib was relieved to get home and just relax. 
I will not drink today no matter what the day brings.
I will not drink today!
I will not drink today.
Feeling kind of sick and I just want to go home and crawl into bed but it's not from being hungover which is great! I will not drink with you today.
Struggling but nothing alcohol won't make infinitely worse. I won't drink with you all today.   
I will not drink today.
I love yall and will not drink with you today ..Ps how do i get my "3 days" badge? Flair?
Not drinking today!..Went to a social event with an open bar this weekend and didn't even want to drink. It was amazing. Thanks for all your help sober community!
I will not drink today!
No matter what happens good or bad I will not drink today!!!!
My goals this week are to clean clean clean! I just moved into my very first home! I can't believe we own! And I have a lot of organizing/settling in to do!..I've been craving lately so another goal is to make sure I stay sober! I'll start by not drinking today. 
I will not drink today
No drinks today!
Not drinking today!
I won't be drinking with you! :)
It's a perfect June day since I won't be drinking today! Join me!
I just requested my badge after one hell of a fuck up this Saturday. I did something incredibly foolish and caused thousands of dollars of property damage. I'm still waiting on insurance adjusters to come through and give me an initial estimate of the damage. I've quit before and picked up the drink again and I just can't keep doing this. My wife and my kid deserve better than this...This is a great community and I'm very pleased to be here with you guys. I won't drink with you today.
I will not drink today
Not drinking today.  I have a family event tonight that includes making a video for my great nephew's wedding that we won't be able to attend.  My family and I are not too compatible so this will be a stiff sort of thing.  Usually after these get togethers I can hardly wait to get home and start drinking to erase my discomfort.  Well tonight I face it with clear eyes and a better attitude!  Yes!
Got a day off and I'm going to a late afternoon picnic but  I won't be drinking today!
I will not be drinking with all of you today 
I will not drink today.
I will not drink with you guys today.  I was tempted strongly yesterday multiple times and came within feet of a store (had to pick up groceries next door) but did not drink.  I thought of my promise to you guys and also not wanting today to be a royally f__ed up day.  I love you SD.
Feeling strong about not drinking with all of you today
I'm not drinking today. 
No drinking today
No matter what happens today good or bad I will not drink any alcohol for the next 24 hours.
I won't drink today. 
I've made it 21 days! I am so thankful for this sub honestly the thought of having to re-set my badge is enough to not pick up a drink. 
I am dragging ass for no apparent reason today but I will not drink! 
Rough weekend ended up drinking. :-( Why is this so hard at times. I mean its a decision. Time to reset the badge. But today is a new day and I will not drink today. 
I will not drink today
Not drinking with y'all today!.Goal for this week is not to sulk in darkness weakness and urges but to monitor them with self love and mindfulness with the help of my Higher Power.
I'm here and I'm not drinking with y'all today!
[removed]
Happy Monday....joining the gang and not drinking anything but soda water!  Make today be the best day of your life.  Cheers
I'm not going to drink today. 
I will not drink today. 
I will not drink today. 
I will not drink today.
Not drinking today. It's really starting to be rewarding. 
I will not drink today.
I will not drink today. 
17 days back on the right path so more than half a month.  Feeling good and it's much easier to ignore the cravings now (and they're fewer).  7:30 pm - 8:30 pm is the most onerous time but it's not too difficult to get through.  I just need to prevent the "eh it's not really a problem after all is it?" thoughts from derailing me.  Even if it wasn't a problem I love waking up without my head in the rain cloud of last night's alcohol indulgences.
This week will be a test for me as now that I've gotten over the hangover and the couple days following this week will definitely test me.   I seem to think after around a week I can just have 1 or 2.  1 or 2 after a whole week of drinking is not bad...right?  Well not until it turns to the usual 10-12.  So I will not drink today and that's what I'm focusing on.
I will not drink with you today!
I was dealing with so much stress and conflict yesterday that I forgot to check in...or drink. I did think about it briefly at one point but pressed on.....I will not drink with you today!
Today is day 2 for me. First Monday I haven't showed up to work completely hungover in I don't know how long. Yesterday I made the decision to quit drinking and then sought out a sub Reddit since I do use Reddit often. I'm glad I found this group. I will not drink with you all today!
I will not drink today 
I'm in 
Thanks for the great check-in Chrispy. My goal for the week is to change my bad attitude!.I won't be drinking with you today. 
No drinking today
Stayed sober for about 6 months a year back fell off. Now I'm back. Hosting a July 4 get together which is going to be the hardest part...
I almost forgot to check in.  I'm not drinking today!
I will not drink today.  Close to that triple digit!!
I will not drink today. 
My goals for the week are to stay sober the most important one. And second keep my apartment clean and tidy I find I feel a lot more at peace when things are kept up on. When I'm drinking it's hard to keep up but now I have a lot more time so it shouldn't be a problem. I won't drink with all of you today!
Not gonna drink today.
Guess who's not drinking today?..THIS GIRL.
I will not drink today.
On my second week!
I won't drink today.
Hey Chrispy!  Thanks for hosting the DCI.  I will not drink today no matter what.  My goal for this week is to stick to my evening plan of dinner by 6:30 and bed by 9:30.  It's a simple plan but it cascades into so many other goals that can be met if I get that much sleep and am up early.  I had a beautiful hike in the Rockies and it reminded me just how important it is for me to recharge in nature.  Happy Monday everyone!
I did a 25 mile bike ride this morning.  Would I have done it if hungover?  Nope...I want to ride tomorrow too.  So for that and many more reasons I will not drink today.
I think I already did this today and I can't remember but just in case I will not drink today.
Just completed my first week looking forward to completing my second week... I won't drink with you today
Checking in! I'm still here this time. This is probably the longest I've gone without a drink for around 7+ years...Went for another run today. Plan to read more of my book later this evening. Feels good.
I will join y'all in not drinking today.
Day 1 AGAIN. I will not drink with you all today.
I will not drink with you today :D.
Day 9 - I will not drink today!!
Day 2.  I've been cleaning up around the house and listening to podcasts...I won't drink today.
Didn't drink at all during the music festival this past weekend. Not drinking today either!
First time here - one week today .. I will not drink with you all today ..
I will not drink today 
I'm not going to drink today. 
Today I will not hide myself with alcohol. I will be vulnerable and accept uncertainty and discomfort. I am not drinking with all of you today!
Withdrawal is over and I'm still not drinking with ya'll. So thankful for reddit XD
I won't drink today no matter what happens good or bad. Thank you for the check-in!
Day one. let's do this! 
I will not drink today
Count me in today!
Never too late to check in. I will not drink today!
I will not drink today no matter what happens.  1 week sober!
Checked in with the clinic today my blood pressure has dropped 20pts since I quit drinking. I will not drink today ready to work on Day 5.
I'm tempted today for the first time since counting 
I won't be drinking today.
I've managed 2days! After a stressful day as usual at work. 2 hours unpaid overtime as usual. Maybe with not being always slightly hungover I'll get more efficient and get out of there on time! Today I Will not drink with you all 
Not drinking today y'all!
Day 4. I will not drink today with all you fine folks!.
I will not drink today. 2 days sober one dad at a time!!!
I will not drink today. .
Late to the party again! I have not and will not drink today.
I'm not drinking today! (A bit late to the check-in but wasn't tempted to drink until now.)..I may be unhappy right now but at least I won't wake up hungover. From a practical standpoint budgeting for booze *and* La Croix would be ridiculous. (I quit drinking on my own accord however an intervention would be needed to get me to give up the sparkling water.)
Today I tried to skip dinner since I really had eaten "enough" already. (1000 calorie deficit). However I found myself wandering towards the kitchen where some booze is...instead of making a drink I promptly opened a can of spinach made some microwave veggies and hot dogs and went to town. Afterwards I took a shower and now I'm in bed. I won't drink with you tonight and I won't drink with you tomorrow!
This week I want to go to a yoga class. Also I'm on my phone a lot. I want to start putting my phone away once I get off work and focus on real life. I will not drink today.
Not drinking with you today.
Didn't drink earlier and not drinking the rest of the today. 
Almost at a year and doing pretty well considering I just got out of prison a month or so ago. Had my first shift at work tonight and almost done with most of my court mandated classes. I can't think of a time I've felt better or healthier even with the stuff going on I'm my life. It feels good bot to sabotage my progress and small successes. So that being said I will not drink today. 
I will not drink today.
I will not drink today!
