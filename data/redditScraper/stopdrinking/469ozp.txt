I've been struggling very much with focus and concentration feelng like my mind is all over the place and won't settle down. Since I'm self employed this leads to fears about money and failure and so on and so on - Arrgh as Snoopy would say...No great craving for drink just a strong desire to blow away this brain fog. I do know when I think about it that the fog was much worse when I was drinking so I am grateful for the progress...Last night I had a dream. I was at a professional conference and I joined some colleagues at a bar after the day was over. I ordered a seltzer water with lime. Someone said "I thought you were a gin drinker?."  And I said "No I don't drink alcohol anymore." And the conversation continued as though it was no big deal. .

Wow. I'm on the 47th day also and it seems we are experiencing the same effects. That's reassuring for me to know that it's all just part of the process. Yesterday was particularly hard for me ... I just felt like a drink to "blow away the fog" and mental stress of working for myself. I read recently that the brain will be still transitioning and dealing with the chemical loss of alcohol. But it does get better I think 6-12 months max (which seems a long time - bugger) I'm focusing on getting through February and will go from there. Good luck. 
When somebody asks me if I want a drink I always say "No thanks I've already had plenty."
48 days here. Definitely been struggling with concentration. Drinking lots of caffeine to compensate and fight fatigue which without the booze to knock me out at night could be affecting my sleep...Curious to see what the next few weeks bring...
I'm in the same boat.  Coffee seems to help but can only drink so much of that.  Hopefully our brains are rewiring and we'll move on from this soon!
