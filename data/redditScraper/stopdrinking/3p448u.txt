I knew that when I quit drinking a lot of people who I haphazardly called "friends" would just kind of vaporize. I knew this going in. It's more than worth it. If someone doesn't want to be around you when you're sober they're not your friend. If you not drinking and having to avoid situations with alcohol makes THEM uncomfortable that's their problem. ..But I really didn't expect **THIS**. I was so proud of myself I posted my progress on social media and someone who calls me their 'best friend' (whatever the hell that means I thought we only did that when we were teenagers) had the audacity to say "and all you had to do was ditch all your friends... or was it just me?". I just... wow. All I could think was... WOW. This person totally belittled my efforts and was being completely unsupportive. ..So I texted them and called them on their bullshit and the response I get is that I'm *abusive and mean* and "I've done nothing but support you". From the person who when I first told them I quit drinking messaged me a week later saying "I have a bottle of wine with your name on it". ..They then proceeded to *fucking delete me from FB*. Haha. Wow. ..**Haters gon hate**..I was pretty upset but whatever I'm sober and I deal with those feelings now. I said out loud to myself "I'm angry" and just kind of sat with that. Talked to my SO about my frustrations decided I'm going to move on and treat this like a blessing losing someone that toxic. Okay. Good...Then I fall asleep and I dream. Oh I dream. I dream of a party in my honour with tons of people and tons of alcohol. And in this dream this former 'friend' offers me some booze and I politely decline. They offer again and I accept thinking "Oh whatever it's just one night and everyone's drinking it'll be fun!" and have one drink. Then another. Then another. Until I'm half-naked covered in my own puke. I woke up super upset which quickly morphed into a huge sense of relief that I'm still on track and killing it. ..Thanks brain sometimes you know just the things I need to think to reinforce what's important...I'm still struggling since my SO is still drinking and woke me up being a total asshat this morning at 7 am when they got home from a bender but I can deal with that too. **I won't be stopped.**..**Also** I want to say thanks /r/stopdrinking for being a great place to vent and discuss that seems to have the highest density of good kind understanding people of any site I've yet to visit...Here's to you and here's to over a month sober! Happy Saturday :)

That is a blessing - thank god they showed their true colors! Those are definitely not friends...I also hope you realize their bitchiness stems from their own insecurities and has nothing to do with you...How insecure a person must be to take personally your decision not to drink and feel abandoned over your avoidance of situations in which you will be tempted to do something you do not want to do.  ..&gt;So I texted them and called them on their bullshit..Well I would not recommend doing that and I'm not surprised they reacted poorly. People getting called on their bullshit generally react poorly.  Also you already knew from their personalization and passive-aggressive jabs in place of support that they were not true friends.  So why call them out on anything at that point?  A person worth calling out would not have said that in the first place.  Also "calling someone out on bullshit" sounds like a conflict-oriented thing to do.  A talk or conversation may have gone much better.  If it was worth it...That dream was probably a message from your brain to you to avoid that person/those people.  They pose a risk...Happy saturday.  Good riddance to the old and now sober you can find some better friends.  
I think people that have taken an issue with my sobriety have their own issues to deal with and it has nothing to do with me. ..Keep being you. Keep being awesome!!
I try not to take the things other people do personally. Did you talk to your friend and let her know she might not hear from you for a while because you were laying low? She might have been hurt and confused about why she was cut out of your life. ..I also don't expect normies to understand and be proud of my sobriety so I don't share it with them. I am essentially doing what a normal grown up should already do. ..I am not saying I understand your situation at all but I have found it much better when I focus on changing the things in life I have control over and letting my expectations of other people's behavior go...Good job on the month of sobriety!
I've found that people who are most upset by my sobriety have questioned their own relationship with alcohol. Or some people just take shit reallllllyy personally. ..It sounds as if (and I have no idea) you had to distance yourself from this person because they did not respect your decision to get and remain sober (which is not a friend in my book) and then they became upset with you. Hey maybe they'll see their mistake some day. Maybe they won't. We can't make them realize what they are not ready to realize...It has nothing to do with YOU - it's all about how they react to the world...It sounds like you know what to and where to turn to in these situations!!..Luckily it was just a dream. They happen...And you can get sober in any environment no matter who is drinking!! 
Congrats on 30 days!  Seems like you're looking at it the right way that person wrapped up their own problems into you getting sober.  Sometimes they don't want to admit their own problem and us getting sober might highlight their problem drinking.  ..I've moved away from my old drinking buddies because they weren't good friends even when I thought they were.  Now I have new sober friends that actually care about me what a great thing!  ..For me the drinking dreams finally have gone away haven't had one in nearly 6 months hopefully yours will go away too.  Take care!
Congrats on 30 days they say its the hardest. I've taken my circle from 10-15 all the way down to 1 or 2 people i really call a close friend. You realize how little these people actually meant in your life when you stop drinking. ..I haven't had a "using" dream in a couple weeks and for that I am grateful. But they are the worst. but the frequency of them goes down with time. ..Congratulations again and just keep coming back.
