:/ Aww. I'm glad you are back and am sure you did some learning. iwndwyt. 
I first tried to stop drinking in 1982. The application of some basic math to my day count will show that I haven't been sober since my first try. :-) ..Now you know it can be done because you've done it. I'll share the top-secret your-eyes-only trick to staying sober with you because why not: just don't drink today. You might have to break that down to "don't drink this hour" or even "don't drink this ten minutes" but that will ease over time. That's my whole plan in a nutshell. I get up decide I won't drink today and proceed not to drink. I don't worry about being sober forever or being sober for a year or being sober until next month I just don't drink today. Yep it sounded stupid to me too the first time somebody told me that. But it's Key Number One.
But you're back at it that's what matters. Keep your head up! IWNDWYT. 
I will not drink with you today.
Right there with you. 
It happens.  You now have a really good roadmap of what works and what definitely doesn't work ;)..Good luck!
