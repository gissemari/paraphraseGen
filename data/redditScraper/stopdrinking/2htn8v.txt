It's not about those 140 days. It's about today. Keep it up. 
Many of us have been there many times dust off and make changes. What do you feel it was that "made" you drink?

&gt;If you're traveling cross country and your car breaks down do you scrap the trip and start over? No you fix it and keep going!..You don't start over again. You trip continues if you want! 
Similar thing happened to me on day 93.  All good.  Let's march on...You know this.  You can do this!
I'm on a steady diet of 24 hours a day. 
Welcome back and congrats on three days!
You can do it!
Been there.  Its not the end of the world.  ..Keep it up man the sub is here when you need it.  You should be proud of being able to string together those 140 that's no small feat.
