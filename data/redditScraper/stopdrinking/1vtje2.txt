Greetings to everyone. I've been lurking this sub for about 6 months now after realizing last summer that I lost control over my drinking habits and my life was spiraling downwards because of it. The stories I've read here inspired me to try and stop drinking; I haven't been able to quit entirely though overall I drink more rarely than I used to and I've twice managed to stay sober for several weeks at a time something which seemed impossible to me a year ago. Right now I'm in some sort of purgatory as I'm a mostly functional human being again (that too seemed impossible some time ago) and I still fully intend to stop drinking but I feel like I need to change much of my lifestyle and at the moment I don't really have the time or energy to do so. I'm finishing college in June and I'm under a lot of pressure until then (lots and lots of exams) but after that I'll have a lot more free time and I feel like that's my best chance to really focus on turning my life around and ditching the bottle for good. Until then I'll keep on trying one day at a time...Anyway I felt like sharing a drinking dream I had the other day. I've had a bunch of these dreams before usually the classic scenario of relapsing and waking up feeling terrible disappointment. This time however the dream was oddly metaphorical: I was staring at the bar in a nightclub craving some shots of Jaegermeister (my favorite liquor) but having second thoughts about actually getting them. Suddenly an attractive girl comes out of nowhere and starts flirting outrageously with me while asking if it's really a relapse if she has "just one drink". My doubts instantly went away I told her it's "no big deal" and we agreed to have a couple of shots together; I gave her the money and she went to get them herself. As this happened a feeling of absolute bliss washed over me. I was on top of the world and no one could take me down. Moments later she came back and told me with a huge grin one her face that there wasn't any liquor left and she was leaving. I told her she can't leave; we were having such a great time together and I also happened to give her all my money. She said nothing and disappeared in the darkness leaving me dumbfounded bitterly disappointed and utterly alone wondering what the hell did I do wrong. I went from ecstasy to agony in seconds. I then woke up...The reason I wanted to write about this is because I feel like it perfectly sums up what alcohol is to me now that I'm no longer a "normal" drinker: a fucking lie. It seduces me with empty promises whispering into my ear that "nothing bad can happen if you have just a drink; you know you want me and you know that I'll make you feel great". In the end though there's only headaches nausea shame disappointment depression loneliness a damaged liver and an empty wallet. And that is why I don't want to drink anymore...Sorry for any spelling errors it's 5 in the morning where I live and I'm really tired :). Thanks for reading and stay strong. We can all make it.

Wow yeah that's a good one! Highly recommend writing down everything you can about it-- what did she look like what was she wearing what music was playing was anyone else there? Do any of those things mean anything to you? Unpacking all of that could help (you don't have to do it now of course but having it to look at later might do some good.)
Great analogy! Speaking as an attractive girl myself I'd just like to share that I often use the image of a beguiling man who ultimately turns out to be an abuser. It happens.
