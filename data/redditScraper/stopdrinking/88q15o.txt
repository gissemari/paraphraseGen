I went to the store to buy alcohol and ran across an article in a tabloid about dihydromyricetin (DHM).  The article mentioned that it helps prevent hangovers and helps some people stop drinking.  I came home and did an online search and (surprise!) found a published article (in The Journal of Neuroscience) about how DHM counteracts alcohol intoxication reduced withdrawal signs and greatly reduced alcohol consumption in rats. I found I could purchase it easily so I did...The first test was yesterday.  I took two DHM capsules waited several hours then drank eight beers and a glass of sangria in about two hours and felt *nothing*.  No buzz no intoxication - nothing.  As a result I stopped drinking alcohol and switched to water.  I also slept soundly and had no hangover.  ..I feel like the DHM turned off the part of my brain that enjoys and craves alcohol.  Yesterday afternoon it occurred to me - "I am *free*.  I plan to take DHM every day for the next few months and I have no intention of drinking because I have *no desire* to drink...If you have read about the Sinclair method (which uses naltrexone or nalmefene) then you are already familiar with the basic strategy.  The advantage of DHM over naltrexone is that you don't need a prescription...If you are struggling with cravings and you are desperate to try something DHM may be worth a shot.  I'm glad I used it.  It has given me hope and confidence that my drinking days are over.  On the other hand if you have been sober for a while and are securely abstinent then why bother with DHM?  ..Best of luck to you on your journey..

Where did you get yours?
Really interesting. I'm going to try this.
I hope it works for you. It would not work for me. I have the illness of MORE. 1drink- 1 pill? Gimme MORE of those suckers   .... heard this 1 time : an alcoholic walks into a bar bartender says ' it's all you can drink for $5' ' 'great' says the alcoholic ' I'll have $50 worth'. .....iwndwyt.  
Hey that's great! Naltrexone has been working for me but I've found the side effects hideous. DHM really stopped you from feeling a buzz? I looked it up and all I could find was that it affected GABA transmission and improved alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase function.  .I'd be fascinated to know how it affects the sense of euphoria from drinking - does it also block opioid receptors as naltrexone does? Just thinking aloud really..
Is anyone else feeling like this is a sales pitch?  
This is such a lie.  Went to buy alcohol and came across an article? 
Okay I did my first experiment with DHM last night. It was 7pm and I bought a pint of vodka. I took 5 pills (300mg each) immediately before my first shot. Here were the results:..**Euphoria** - As I kept drinking I could not get my drunkenness feeling higher than about 2-3 drinks. It was like my buzz was "capped"...**Desire to Drink** - Like SDdisposable I too lost the desire to drink. It felt like when you eat and have food left on your plate and you'd rather just not eat what's left because your appetite is satisfied. This may have been part psychological -- I was thinking to myself "What's the point of drinking more? I can't get *more* drunk anyway"...**Sleepiness** - Normally if I drink a pint at 7pm I will pass out by about 10pm or at least be extremely tired. Last night I did not feel tired at all even at midnight. This put me in an interesting situation because normally I would keep drinking until I black out and pass out. I would have went to the bar across the street and get 6 shots of vodka or buy some 8% beer at the convenience store a block over. But last night I felt like it was pointless to do that because my buzz was capped. I literally went to bed just because I knew I needed sleep for work today...My conclusion from this experiment was that a high dose of DHM immediately before drinking converts me into a "normal" drinker for that night. Very interesting. My next experiment will be to wait until I have a craving and then take 5 pills and wait as long as I can before drinking. I want to see if the DHM completely eliminates my desire to drink before I start drinking...One final note. Because DHM is marketed as a hangover prevention drug the obvious danger is that it would cause someone to drink more rather than drink less. They even say on the bottle to not use DHM as an excuse to drink more. But this is two faced because DHM is also supposed to suppress the effects of intoxication i.e. because it is supposed to suppress poor judgement someone who took DHM wouldn't choose to drink more anyway. Basically my experience was exactly as they describe here https://dhmdepot.com/pages/dihydromyrcetin-prevents-alcohol-intoxication...
