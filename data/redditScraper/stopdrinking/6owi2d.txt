I dreamed last night that I had two drinks of some unidentifiable clear liquor and boyyyy was I feeling guilty. I was trying to justify it to myself but I just couldn't. I was disappointed that all of my hard work would be restarted. ..I was so happy to wake up sober! Aside from the dream it was some of the best sleep I've had since childhood. Instead of the guilt and regret I felt in my dream I got to wake up clearheaded and motivated to greet the morning. ..I feel pretty lucky that I got to experience the disappointment of relapse without having to deal with the consequences. Two weeks sober and no badge reset this morning- I will not drink with you today!
