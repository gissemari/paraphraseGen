I gave up for a year in 2015 started drinking again as I thought I had it under control turns out i don't. Swiftly back into old habits drinking 6 to 10 beers a every night alone often with some whisky. Passing out on the bathroom floor most nights promising to myself that last night was the "last" night then auto pilot takes me to the shop to satisfy the craving. Sneaking to the shops to buy alcohol and hiding the empty cans and bottles. Its a shitty way to live...Currently on day 9 learning from old mistakes and feeling much better about myself. Being reminded of the beginning again - the shakes the sweats the broken sleep short attention span the relapse dreams and mostly the intense obsessive brain that constantly screams and whispers to me about alcohol when I'm not having any... Got more to come but the worst of it seems to have died down...Any tips on what to watch out for in the next few weeks/months/years? I'm well aware at 24 I cannot drink like the vast percentage of the population.

White knuckling works for the beginning. I usually binge watched TV shows (careful of ones that have a lot of drinking) to just distract myself. Longer term I realized I had problems with thought patterns and self control and SMART recovery helped me with some of their tools.
