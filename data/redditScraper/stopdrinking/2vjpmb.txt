I have by no means completed my journey my longest streak was only 10 days. But I have made some major progress if I look at my daily ledger..I remember a part of my wake up call was [this chart about american drinking habits](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/09/25/think-you-drink-a-lot-this-chart-will-tell-you/) and for what its worth I have dropped from the top 10 percent(74 drinks a week) into somewhere between the eight and ninth decile(10 drinks a week). ..The reason I bring this up is it can be disheartening to reset the badge even though you really are making some progress however little.

Resetting and starting again while being conscious of your drinking is miles ahead of robotically carting home alcohol and drinking in denial..Keep up the good work!
Congrats on your sobriety but I take issue with keeping the badge. The badge is a symbol of hard work earned. If we relapse it's the price we pay and have to start over. It's honest personal accountability.
I tend to steer clear of the badge though just this morning I requested one. The badge makes me want to drink as stupid as that sounds. *Omg 20 days! I feel great why am I even depriving myself??* Panic ensues. ..Obtaining a number is too much pressure for me. Losing a number makes me feel worthless and a failure instead of looking at the progress that I actually made which brings on the fukkits and I disappear for a few more months while I drink myself into wanting to quit again. ..Most asinine and destructive thought process but I've long since given up trying to understand it. I would think a badge with ascending days would make me proud of myself but it just makes me nervous.
