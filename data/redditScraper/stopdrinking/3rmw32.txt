After seven years of binge drinking I've arrived at three months without a drop. I've seen my brain begin to heal I've noticed my mood level out I've rediscovered the joy of a sweaty workout. It hasn't been all sunshine and roses though. I'm still really struggling to connect with people  and i haven't even begun to clean up the mess i made in college and with my finances. I still think about drinking every day but I know I can't go back to who I was and I'm so grateful for that. Thank you to this community I wouldn't be here without you. I won't drink today.

Thank you for sharing your success and motivation. Congrats on three months!
Congratulations!!  90 days felt more real to me like a true commitment at that point.  Enough time had gone by that I could really see the difference between drunk me and sober me and I really liked who I was becoming.  I won't drink with you today!
Happy 90!! 
Great 90 day post.  In terms of the challenges ahead these can be daunting but at 90 days don't set your expectations of yourself too high.  
Great job! and welcome to sobriety. Just take it easy and don't stress yourself with those messes. Everything will fall into place soon enough. As for connecting with other people start here with us by posting. This is a great place to get comfortable with people and probably earn friends. Congratulations!
