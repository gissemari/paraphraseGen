I'm chasing my tail. I can't tell if I'm kidding myself or if I'm actually OK and just living in the moment... But if anyone wiser than I am sees in this post a Train On A Track would you tell me?..In 2016 I drank nothing for about 11.5 months. It helped - my mind relationships and outlook...Then I drank four times (and yes absolutely I am counting): on Christmas Day night  New Year's Eve and then on date-nights in January and February. ..Each time I was alone with my wife and I drank a single glass of wine. Three of those times I was clear-headed and at peace. That is not how I used to drink (bottle or two a night of wine)...The most recent time though a few weeks ago I got buzzed. It felt bad like Relapse...On the plus side I got from it a new piece of information: genuinely I do not want to be drunk...Now I'm torn. Part me says "Meh. If you feel bad about that one just keep not drinking for a month or two or three." And that's going fine. A more exacting side of me is unsatisfied. I'm tempted to fire up my badge again. Only that seems like reactive bullshit bc I don't have a badge-related goal. And the most intense part of me says "Never have another."..Anyone have advice on the badge or anything else in this post? Or can you talk about a similar experience or train of thought?..Thanks..
