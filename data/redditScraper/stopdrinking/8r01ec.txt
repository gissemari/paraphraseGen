I've made my choices.I've hated them all.I've heard all the voices.They don't make me stall..The struggle is real.It's weakness at best.I know that it steals.But I've forgotten the rest..The rest of my life.The big part that I play.Consequences and strife.My family's pain..I hate myself truely.This nightmare won't end.Can't set myself free.Once the day has began..I cry and I pout.Such a hideous man.Remorseful with doubts.I want to smile again..But the smile is gone.Even after the drink.I'm forever alone.As I stand on the brink..If I jump will I fly?.Soaring over the pain?.If I fall will I die?.Or start all over again?..I know that I'm loved.But that surely won't help.No one standing above.As I sink into this hell............

Incredible writing. Very powerful words.
That said I hope your ok. I see no context to know where you are on the journey which is why I comment only on the art. Jules
