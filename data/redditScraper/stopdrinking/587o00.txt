So I've known I have an issue with alcohol for a while but ignored it. I can't ignore it anymore. It was my weekend and I went on a bender with a friend who also has his own struggles with alcohol. I'm back at work but feel like crap and have just come to the realization that this is unsustainable and I'm ready to be done with it.

Best advice I can give is to take it one day at a time. Don't drink today. Hydrate exercise (life weights go for a walk or bike ride do yoga) try some mindful meditation eat well do some hobbies. Depending on how much you drink and how long you've been doing it be careful. Cold turkey is no joke if you are in deep.
Took me ten years of secretly knowing I had a problem before I finally did something about it. ..Had hundreds of "never again" Mondays (and Tuesdays and Wednesdays and...well you get the idea)...It's difficult but you can do it. This sub offers great advice and support if you need/ want it. ..Keep on keepin' on!..
