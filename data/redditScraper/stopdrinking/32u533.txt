Hello all. I've recently reached my one year mark. Feeling very good about that. I'd elaborate but we all know the struggles and how much it sucks :)..I just needed to vent and make sure I'm not alone here...While things generally are going very well on my path to sobriety I am finding myself becoming negative. I have lost interest in friends I used to have and conversations I used to carry. I find myself getting extremely angry when people want to go out to a bar which I suppose isn't so crazy. But I'm finding myself relishing the anger that I'm encountering. Now THAT is weird. Nice days make me cringe. I have no patience for people. What's happening to me? (Insert Arrested Development Buster "I'm a monster!" GIF here). My friends all know about my sobriety and are great. But I guess I'm BORED with their lifestyle choices (which used to be my lifestyle too) I find them so boring with their constant drinking and conversations about the same people in the same situations. My patience is zero. I feel like my anger rises up so quickly and intensely. I commute on a NYC subway so that doesn't help my anger one bit. :)..I've been burying myself in work which I can only surmise is because I want to be so busy with that stuff that I don't have "time" for other things that make me anxious. Does that make sense? ..I used to use alcohol as an anxiety/nerve suppressor when I'd go to events or parties where I was uncomfortable. But now that I don't have that I have to just be...me. Which is hard. But when I DO push through the initial anxiety I usually end up having fun. So why I am so resistant to this? I used to be very social or at least I THOUGHT I was being social. When actuality I was the drunk guy that people just had to "deal" with. I had a small realization that by taking away alcohol I'm more vocal about not wanting to be out at a party or a bar. When I WAS drinking I never wanted to do these things either but because I could drink at them I'd go. ..I'm very lucky to have a fiance that is incredibly supportive and she usually brings me out of these funks. ..As a P.S. - I wrote and deleted this four times before I actually decided to post. I don't want to sound like I'm complaining. Thank you for reading. .

Well better to be Grumpy than Sleepy Sneezy or Dopey!..Alright!  You are right where you are supposed to be.  At one year I was also very angry.  Guess what?  I had uncovered one of the root causes for my alcoholism.  Alcohol for me suppressed anger and then allowed me to express it in inappropriate ways always with the excuse of 'I was drunk' when I acted out...I discovered and you may also be in the process of discovering that anger is part of your emotional makeup.  How then do you release and not suppress that anger and do so in appropriate ways?  That is the process you must now be willing to tackle...You are *not* complaining.  You are bringing up a very valid and critical point.  The idea that we are supposed to spend our sober days in grateful bliss is hogwash.  Some of us have deep-seated emotional scars which can be expressed as anger and can be expressed in other ways too which must be dealt with in order to have a full and meaningful recovery...So congratulations on your year and congratulations on discovering that just stopping drinking did not fix every problem.  You are not alone.  You are not worse than or better than other ex-drunks for having this particular problem...As for how to deal with anger resistance and a lack of desire to socialize that would turn this reply into a novel.  But help is out there; go seek it...Thanks for posting
