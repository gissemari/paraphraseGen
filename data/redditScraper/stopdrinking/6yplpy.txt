I had my last drink August 27th. As  i just turned 29 on the 22nd my body couldn't take it anymore. I was unhappy with the way I looked and felt having body image issues the drinking only made me forget it about it for a time. Since I always wanted to get back into fitness I knew I had to make a decision. Last year I lost 20 pounds but with my drinking I just gained it all back. I was unhappy and hating myself. On the 28th I started working out and eating healthy again with the help of the athleanx program and have never felt better. Not waking up with a hangover is the best part.  I may be a week and a half into this program but already the weight is shedding off of me and I notice a difference. Will keep this up and keep on improving. I know I have struggles but Not anymore. This may be long winded but I had to vent. And I know this is the place that will listen
