It's only been five days but I just want to say that getting through the first three days..**Sunday**: I spent the last four days hanging out with my friends out of town eating and drinking well.  I was probably drunk the whole time.   I drank too well.  I'm kind of that guy too among my friends. Saturday I had to go home and take a nap.  Earlier I thought it'd be smart to tell a street preacher what I thought about him.  Jesus Christ....At the airport on my way home I get two beers at the bar and another J&D on the flight.  Very chatty I'm not very chatty sober.  I buy breathmints on my way out of my home airport.  My wife picks me up and needs to stop at CVS; I get a tallboy.  I drink just about everything left in our house later on.  At some point later in the night my last drink...**Monday**: Felt TERRIBLE.  Extreme guilt and anxiety.  Sweating something nasty but trying hard not to show any signs of abnormality to my co-workers or my wife.  My boss early forties asks me about my "Bro Weekend"; I say I just can't keep up anymore.  I look haggard; I haven't shaved since last Wednesday and it doesn't help.  I'm 30.  He replies "Yeah and it's not going to get any better as you get older".  ..::beat::..I acknowledge those words as I force a smile and walk away.  Does he know how fucked up I got?..But I know this: he's right.  ..This day was the worst.  The anxiety eats me alive; I feel like I was going to get fired at any moment.  Yet I can hardly remember this day much like I can hardly remember nights when I blacked out.  My body's working overtime.  Later on we go out to eat.  I'm being really nice to my wife but I feel guilty knowing that being nice won't make me feel any less guilty about my personal drinking fuckups...**Tuesday**: Still feeling terrible.  Workday was easier though.  Team Softball game that night I turned down the offer of Bud Lights (it wasn't hard to do) and had a decent first-game-since Intramural Softball in College in 2004.  I had to hoof it back to the train station -- 1.2 miles in 15 minutes with jeans a hoodie and a backpack on.  I was a sweating mess but compared to the poison-excretion sweats I had on Monday -- which I still had Tuesday -- I didn't mind it...**Wednesday**: Starting to feel a little relief and less guilt and anxiety but more of a neverending headache starting to fill the hole that was left.  I tried to go for a run but either my backpack-run from the night before or my body aching from the weekend before killed that about 100 feet into it.  I fall asleep on my couch still sweating god knows what...**Thursday**: Spent most of the day in anticipation knowing full well I'm going to the Sox (baseball) game that night.  It's been more than a decade since I went to a sporting event without drinking.  When my buddy gets to the game I don't really beat around the bush and tell him I'm not drinking tonight.  He had just told me that he was probably going to get a beer; why? he asks.  He never drank like I did but probably knows that it's unusual for me to say.  "I feel better when I don't".  That's a half truth -- the other part of it is that if I get one I'll probably get five or six more.  And I'll wake up the next day hungover and will spend all day that day thinking about my next drink.  But it's also expensive so that helps me rationalize to myself.  I get a few coupons for free Diet Pepsi's for signing up to be a DD (that's a lie my friend is driving but nobody cares).  I have a huge blowout shit in the 6th inning that is likely related to my escapades from FOUR DAYS AGO.  First time I've taken a shit in a ballpark in a long time.  Not great...Funny thing about going to a game though... a LOT of people drink a LOT of beer.  Lots of double-fisting going on.  Lots of desperation on peoples' faces when "LAST CALL" starts to sound off in the top of the seventh.  I know the reason I used to drink beer at the game-- I liked getting drunk.  I wonder why everyone else does it.  ..I see a man who must be in his late forties (can't really tell) stumbling up the stairs shouting stumbling down the stairs.  By himself.  Double fisting $9 pints of Miller Lite by the end of the night a section away from me.  A young couple are talking to him probably egging him on to his complete oblivion.  I watch him struggle to put his beers down on the railing.  I wonder if that's the path I was on.  My friend never got his beer.  Not on my account I don't think.  He doesn't drink like I used to...**Friday**: I've had some Fridays without drinking but not many.  I still have some headaches but I start to wonder if it's just from caffeine or stress or something else.  I no longer think I'm going to get fired.  The anxiety is gone; I'm good at my job damnit.  I feel good enough that I could almost convince myself that drinking's not so bad if I hadn't done so much reading on r/stopdrinking and I hadn't thought so much about what I want my life to be like.  I get into a squabble with my wife later in the night but unlike the few times we've fought before I'm not slurring like a drunk.  We resolve our issue (it was about budgeting money for a big trip) before bed.  ..**Saturday**: I'm awake dicking around like a normal Saturday morning but not hungover not blowing off my plans to work out and enjoying my coffee.  ..-----------------------.The most important conclusion I've come to this week was that I know why I first started to drink: it was a teenage rebellion type of thing and it was just what people did in college or at least the people I knew did.  "Getting drunk" was a fun thing!  People did that!  ..And somewhere the coin flipped; 30 year olds don't "get drunk".  But.. I was. Why did I keep doing it?  A decade lost waiting for my next drink and the 10 that followed it...I'm seeing the things I used to view as pros completely melt away in light of the cons.  ..And it feels good..

Good for you! I think by day 4 I was feeling human. In those 4 days I went to 2 meetings a day and continued that for almost a month...I cannot stress enough having a plan/program the anxiety over having a lot of free time sober will lead you right back to it regardless of how bad it felt to sober up...Keep it up!
Great post /u/romalain I strongly related to this:..&gt; And somewhere the coin flipped; 30 year olds don't "get drunk". But.. I was. Why did I keep doing it? A decade lost waiting for my next drink and the 10 that followed it...It's only a "lost decade" if you fail to use the experience to illuminate your path forward.  The AA Big Book on p. 124 reminds me to:..Cling to the thought that . . . the dark past is the greatest possession you have - the key to life and happiness for others. With it you can avert death and misery for them..
