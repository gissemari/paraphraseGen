I've kind of avoided posting on here - because I feel like the community is very helpful for me to read but that there isn't an actual community network of support here but I'm kind of at wits end and my meeting tonight isn't until 6:30 or 8:00 depending on which one I choose to go to - **so** I'm going in raw no throwaway I'm tired of the stigma of this disease keeping people from being honest and open about their struggles with it...So prepare yourself - years of stored up shit is coming. I just want to get it actually written down and hopefully it can reach someone and if not well at least it's down on paper and maybe it can be out of my head for today...I'm a 24 year old occasional student although I've been averaging about a semester a year for the last two so I really need to just finish up I'm getting kind of desperate for some kind of non restaurant work and to have a more stable existence that isn't constantly in flux with massive life changes every few months...I've been a problem drinker from day one. I remember drinking a small amount of wine that a friends parents let us have at age 12 or 13 and thinking "hmm there's still some in that bottle I wonder how I can finish it without them noticing." I was always the one at the part who drank too much in high school. My friends had a nickname for me - Draxel (for drunk Axel) - for when I would get to the state where I was mumbling incoherently in the corner (at best) or wildly flying off the walls (at worst). I've trashed friends rooms stolen from them broken into their homes. I feel like every time I see them they are vaguely on eggshells worrying about a possible episode of alcoholic chaos...I've stolen cars and driven them drunk. I've passed out outside. I've woke up in the hospital ER more times than I can remember. I've passed out at work. I've blacked out while driving. I've drank Listerine Robotussin Vanilla extract. I've woke up in cars in the parking lot of bars with the car battery dead soaked in piss and I am so absolutely sick of it it will kill me soon...I've been absolutely terrified of death since I can remember I used to stay up for hours as a child in a state of terror. Bargaining and pleading with myself on why it will be ok "it's not for a long time." I prayed to a god I didn't believe in "now I lay me down to sleep / I pray the lord my soul to keep / If I should die before I wake / I pray the lord my soul to take." I would crawl into my parents room not wanting them to know how I was feeling and lay on the floor with the dogs in the cold Minnesota winters because being close to them somehow made it feel a bit better...Now alcohol does this for me to some extent when I drink I don't feel alone either because it opens me up socially or it just numbs the fear and anxiety I feel over death and the unpredictably of life. I know rationally that this makes no sense - nearly all of my isolation is caused by my drinking but there it is...I don't want it to sound like I'm trying to glorify drinking in some Faulknerian way like "my pain is so great I need to drink." We all have to deal with pain and darkness and alcohol has always been linked to that in a deep way but alcohol is a crutch it lets us not feel but doesn't change the pain or loneliness of modern life - for the alcoholic at least it makes it worse...I lost my girlfriend of almost 10 years to this. Someone I loved more than I can ever put into words. Someone who I'm still in contact with and who still loves me very very much but has her own issues to work out while become a woman and who has stated more than once "I don't want to watch you die." I truly wouldn't wish alcoholism on anyone's loved one - I was an emotional wreck when we lived together and the pain I've put her through is too much for me to even think about. ..My dad has glioblastoma - a progressive and nearly always fatal brain tumor that he has been dealing with for the past year. The treatments and the cancer itself are in the motor cortex and he is paralyzed on his right side. We care about each other deeply but our relationship has been extremely strained due to our respective diseases. It hurts me very greatly that I can't be there to support him better in this overwhelmingly scary time. I don't really know how to process this...In the past month I spent a stint at Hazelden in Minnesota (treatment #3) - a time where I felt better and better about the future prospect of my life until inevitably I left. The first day out I was getting coffee around the corner from my new house and this attractive girl walks up and out of the blue asks me out to the divest of college bars in Minneapolis - Station 280 also known as Station 2Shady. I know it's no ones fault but my own and my disease but it just felt like a laser guided missile sent by the gods of alcohol to obliterate the progress I thought I had made in the last month. I actually did alright that night we got drunk played pool slept together. I then spent the next 6 days obliterated drunk pretty much the whole time in a state of semi blackout while The Leauge played on my TV...I dropped out of school again for the semester and am heading back to Hazelden later this week hopefully. I hope to god I'm all in this time. My mantra for the fall is "half measures availed us nothing."..I don't really know why I chose to type this out today I just feel like my wheels are spinning and needed to do something while I sit here with a coffee and a cigarette on this overcast Minneapolis morning feeling very overwhelmed....*Listening to: You Radiohead*..*Feeling: ~wistful~* .;)

How are you able to afford this many expensive stints at rehab? **It's time to get a grip.** For someone afraid of death you are dancing with the devil. 
I wish I had something helpful to say.  I read your post and I hope your life is better soon.  
&gt;I would crawl into my parents room not wanting them to know how I was feeling and lay on the floor with the dogs in the cold Minnesota winters because being close to them somehow made it feel a bit better...Because dogs are magic. ..I'm with SOmuch2learn on the community here. Actually it is a warm and amazing place. I have had some amazingly soft and comforting interactions and some bitch slap tough love here and I can tell you neither of those things come from people who couldn't give a fuck. I have made real personal connections and those came because I reached out to people whose way of sharing really spoke to me and because I am actively trying to give back some of the support I am getting. It's like anything if you make yourself known then arms open right? You could have the same here if that's something you want! There is so much room for your contributions and space for you to grow here. Welcome.
