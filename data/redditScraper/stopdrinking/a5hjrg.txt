Fell off the wagon about a week after a month sober. I'm making easy mistakes at work and can't get over the anxiety. I couldn't bring myself to face the day knowing what issue or breakdown I may have ahead. This is one of the only support groups besides my family. ..Going to get clean again today but understand it's a huge struggle. Any words of encouragement help

You're here so that's a good step! You care and want to get better. Keep going! 
Now you know you can do it just a case of getting back on the horse...Stay strong and I like to remind myself on stressful days: There is no problem or challenge that alcohol cannot make worse...IWNDWYT
