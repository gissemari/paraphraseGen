Just want to bring some good news to all of you...It keeps getting better over time. Sometimes I felt stagnant but if I stick with it I eventually bust through the plateau...I noticed in approach 2 years that I'm 10x more resilient than I used to be. If something I don't like happens I can recover from it pretty quickly and find a way to cope with it. It's not just quitting drinking its also talking to other people in recovery who can share wisdom. I have a network of people to help instead of just trying to "ignore it" by pouring booze on my brain...It's the little ups and downs that I deal with the best now. Things like setbacks trying to get healthy and lose weight or get in shape. A diet fails or I injure myself in the gym. Instead of interpreting that as a catastrophe and concluding I should just stay on the couch forever I wait it out. When I get the energy to try again I go for it...I think this is because recovery has taught me the value of persistence and open-mindedness in the face of failure. There is always something to learn from a relapse (or MANY relapses) as long as you are willing to give it another go and be open to suggestions about how you should change in the future. If you apply this lesson to the rest of your life things improve *dramatically*...So carry on and stay sober. It just keeps getting better.

Agreed. Feel like I am finally making progress on my diet ... spending time here has taught me to fall down 7 times get up 8 times. Persistence.
