I'm only 22 but I struggled with drinking for a year. I never drank during under grad until my senior year. I always was the "stoner chick." I had fun and such. Senior year rolls around and I thought to myself why not go out more. I did and I realized I liked the taste of vodka and cider ALOT. I started drinking every night. ..My grades didnt slip they got better so I didn't think I had a problem. I graduated in an honor society and many professors wanted to write me letters of recommendation grad school. ..Well I got a DWI in September and that didnt stop me from drinking. I thought to myself that it was fine because the charge didn't stick. I still drank every night. I was coming home from work in January and crashed my mom's BMW suv. I hit black ice going 55 mph. I am honestly lucky to be alive right now considering the damage to the car. If I was in my own I may have not walked away. When the police showed up to the accident they thought I had been drinking. I wasn't. I got crappy advice from a lawyer to not say anything and not take any test they try. So I did just that. I got another DWI. I also suffered a concussion and didn't know what was really going on. The cops thought I was drunk because of the concussion symptoms I was showing and the fact I wouldn't do anything for them. ..5 months later I'm sober and experienced going to jail (very humbling). I wrote a letter to myself when in jail that I carry around with me every day. Life is getting better for me but it is hard. I think of all the stress I've put on my parents and it makes me so sad. ..The letter I wrote to myself is for the days it gets hard. It's a reminder of what struggles I've been through and may go through. It can be applied to any situation and any person reading it if you change up the introduction. It made my parents both cry when they read it. I've never seen my dad cry in my life and to see that made me realize I was on the right path. ..The climb out of this hole is a struggle but I'm getting there. I'm starting to study for the LSAT again and am focusing on the person that I want to become. I do not want to be a disappointment anymore. ..If anyone would like to talk or read the letter I wrote I'd be happy to do so. Keep on moving forward and think about all the good things that will come from not drinking!
