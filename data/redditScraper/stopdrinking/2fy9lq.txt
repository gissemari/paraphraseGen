Hey /r/stopdrinking..Just wanted to pop in and say hello.  This marks the furthest I've been in any form of sobriety since I started drinking/partying/whatever 10 years ago.  This sub has been extremely useful just in hearing stories sharing struggles and a general sense of community that feels as if its here for you when times are tough and all of the other times...To anyone just starting out I think I've said this before but it gets better.  I feel like I am becoming the person I was always meant to be.  Confidence integrity trust respect words I never associated with until now are part of my daily life.  ..I still struggle.  Life still has a way of reminding you that you are not the center of the world and the sooner you can realize that the better it will be to just let go and enjoy the ride.  I've been playing guitar again and have been working on unconvincing myself that I need to be inebriated to be creative or "connected to the music"...Anyways before I start rambling thank you SD and best of luck to you people just starting out.  We're here for you and it only gets better once you let that day counter start ticking.  ..
