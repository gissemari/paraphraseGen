Yes I guess you can say I caved in... but to ME it was a huge victor I made a big-ass mixed drink and only had a sip before tossing it...I admit I drank very heavily from thanksgiving to Dec 1 I own up to it. I felt absolutely shitty though (pardon the language)...Tonight I plan on not even pouring a drink...On the positive side I had a great night's sleep last night

So do you have a plan to avoid the same mistake? As I'm fond of saying lesson learned. But lesson learned comes with the understanding that I won't make the same mistake twice. If I do that's not a mistake anymore it's intentional.
Alcoholism is not entirely about drinking or drinking too much.  In fact if you look no further than the wikipedia entry you will see that it is defined as a mental obsession with alcohol characterized by frequent uncontrolled drinking.  Get that: a mental obsession.  Once I drank too much too often and crossed some sort of line I developed certain distortions in my thinking that resulted in obsessive thinking about alcohol.  This is why I need to 1. not drink and 2. recover.  I do the first by not picking up any alcohol; and the latter by attending support meetings.  In my case AA meetings.  Good luck in putting the next sober 24 hours together.
I would be more focused on the fact that you stopped after one sip than the fact that you had a sip. Go you!
