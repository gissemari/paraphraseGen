45 days ago I broke down and admitted to myself my wife and my parents that I am in fact an alcoholic. It was a terribly painful yet liberating experience. I've long looked at myself as a "weak" person if I was to admit to my alcoholism. For years I tried to tell myself that this was a phase that it was due to stress or my job or whatever bullshit excuse I could come up with. I told myself that drinking into oblivion several nights a week was normal that I could handle it that everyone came to work hungover on Monday...The end of labor day weekend saw me sitting at home drunk and miserable waiting for my wife to get back and yet again scold me for being hammered when she walked in the door. She walked in saw me and quietly went into our room without saying a word. For whatever reason I had a moment of clarity. I wasn't able to come up with any excuses why I should be drunk. Things at work were going well family was safe and healthy anxiety was less stress was lower. I literally had zero excuses anymore and then it hit me SHIT I am an alcoholic. ..The next day I went to a meeting. It was not my favorite thing in the world by any means and it wasn't convenient for my schedule. I was determined to complete 90 in 90 so I went back online to find another. Luckily I found an early risers meeting that was about a mile away from my office. What a breath of fresh air! These people were great. They understood my dilemmas and were of great support and help. ..For the past 45 days I have not missed a single workout not missed a single day of work and literally everything about my life has been better. There are cravings and longings of course but every day I experience life in a new way. Yesterday I went golfing and shot an 88! This was the first time in a LONG time that I even remember what my score was at the end of the round much less in the 80's. ..Tonight I'll go out to dinner with my wife and parents and have some soda. I've been drinking La Croix like it is my job and I feel great. Discussing drinking with some of my co-workers has been awkward at times but not nearly as weird as saying obscene stuff while drunk...This sub has been a great daily reminder of the benefits of sobriety. Thank you to those who post their successes and struggles. Keep it up! Thanks for reading.
