It's been something that I've gone back and forth on for so long. But I need the help. I need to verbalize this struggle. ..I am not Jack Donaghy. I cannot crush it in my mind-vice. I have to admit this stuff out loud and have someone out there know that this is the real me. It's so nerve-wracking to think that someone in my home town might see me there but at the same time it will make it feel more real to me. I can't keep hiding this anymore. ..Wish me luck.

Hey if someone sees you there well...they're there too so.....Jack Donaghy is a huge alcoholic and has a lot of other character flaws I wouldn't aspire to be like him! There's an episode where he tries to quit drinking - and isn't able to I wish they had made that more of an issue instead of sweeping it under the rug by the end. (Can you tell I'm binging on 30 Rock currently?)

Good luck. You may want to check out the sidebar of the r/alcoholism subreddit. There are links to two articles about what it is like to go to your first meeting. ..Keep us posted. IWNDWYT 
The only people from your home town that will be there are alcoholics. So how can they criticize you? It is called Anonymous for a reason. The meetings I attend end with the statement that everything shared in the room stays in the room. We respect everyone's privacy and we are there to support each other. ..Alcoholics are just like everyone else and some will be jerks. However my experience in AA has been good and I feel safe when I am sharing in the room. Good luck.
