Hey you all! Hope everyone's week is going tremendous. Have a question that seems obvious but is also laden with pitfalls along the route. I will be traveling shortly staying in a hotel no one to hold me accountable but myself and very fresh into recovery. Anybody take that leap and come out on top? And if so what was the day to day to ensure you're maintaining sobriety without having to white knuckle the obvious easy route of relapse?..I have plenty of books a new workout plan napping and obviously SD to keep me company but I would really like to hear all options. ..Small town USA 2 restaurants and 3 liquor stores commute back home is almost impossible (2 plus hours one way) and a job for 5-10 days

If you have a significant other  or someone to be accountable to buy a cheap keyring breathalyzer and commit to sending them a text msg picture at noon and 9pm.  That helped me immensely early in recovery when I was alone.
I'm on the road away from home in hotels 4-5 nights every week with my job. I don't have any tips other than what you've already mentioned. I work out read books (This Naked Mind and Alcohol Explained right now) spend a ton of time on this sub and I try really hard to avoid things that would tempt me to drink. I've been grabbing a Perrier or something fizzy around 5 every day to get ahead of the witching hour. And I might check out an AA meeting next time I'm feeling like I'm in trouble (like I was in Vegas last Friday night...that was tough). ..Sorry I don't have anything Earth shattering to share with you but I wanted to reply to make sure you know it can be done and it can be done by someone early in their sobriety. ..We can beat this thing. Be strong!!
