I'm almost done with day two. I was having pretty serious gnawing pain in my upper abdomen before I stopped. This pain started about 2.5 years ago before I first got sober. Have been sober for 26 of the last 30 months and every time I've relapsed the pain has come back. I've seen a doctor and they say either pancreatitis or gallbladder disease which I know means I cannot drink again ever. I'm also supposed to avoid greasy and fatty foods. ..Okay finally my question: do you have any tips for alleviating stomach pain/discomfort caused by drinking?

Alcohol irritates the lining of the digestive tract. I had terrible pain. Once I stopped drinking the pain went away. Perhaps this is something to ask your doctor. 
My gastrointestinal system was a complete mess by the end of my drinking. I could not hold food down was barfing several times a day had non-stop diarrhea and terrible pain in my upper abdomen. The first three issues went away immediately the pain took a bit longer but it went away after a couple of months of not drinking. Simply not drinking has incredible healing power for the body. (I am not a doctor so do consult one if in doubt.)
Probiotics can be helpful for some people to get their gut flora back to normal quicker.  I have read quite a few books on inflammation and there are many foods that are very therapeutic to the GI.  Just like there are plenty of foods/substances that are terribly inflammatory.  Might be worth researching a bit.  I wish you well.
I had the same issues. Ate light like yogurt and puddings. Toast soup. Took several weeks but Im better now.
