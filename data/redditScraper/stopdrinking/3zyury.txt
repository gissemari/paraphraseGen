You're amazing! Thanks for this post. It really reminds me that there is never a good reason for picking up the bottle and there's always a reason for staying away from it. 
You are Atlas. Inspiring stuff. 
So encouraging - choosing to be sober and staying sober. I know I didn't need much of an excuse to drink now I have empowered myself by choosing to remain sober - no matter what! Thank you for sharing it.
