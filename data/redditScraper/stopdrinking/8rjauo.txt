Every day I try to stop again. Every day I fail. I'm terrified. I don't know what to do.

If whatever you've tried so far hasn't worked try something else and keep trying!..Have you for instance spoken to your doctor about your drinking and desire to stop? Tried an AA meeting or SMART or any of the other recovery programmes out there?..I found the book '*Alcohol Explained*' and the book/YouTube '*This Naked Mind*' really helpful for understanding my drinking problem and permanently changing the way I view alcohol - they are well worth a look.....What will you *DO* differently today?..Get rid of all the booze in the house? Take a different route home that doesn't go past the bar or liquor store? Plan something else to do to fill the time? Etc etc.....The only drink to worry about dodging every day is the *first one*.....It's totally do-able with the right knowledge tools and support!..I'm not drinking today hope you'll join me?..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
I might try AA or SMART if you have not yet.  And I would just keep trying.  I relapsed continually for 2.5 years when I was trying to quit.  Then it clicked for me.  Just keep going! Wishing you strength.  You can do this! IWNDWYT 
Thank you so much. I *have* to do this. I'm okay once stopped but damn if I can *get* stopped. I won't give up. I won't give up trying. 
I failed regularly for a long time.  I had to get arrested and stand in front of a judge fail again admit that failure to a probation officer and be required to see a shrink take meds do AA IOP and have jail hanging over my head...I can't say what made it work because I tried literally everything.  It was priority number one.  ..Today what makes the maintenance work is;..1) Trusting "God".  This is the hardest part but the most important.  Call it whatever you have to.  The universe love Jesus Christ Krshna community Hashem Gaia... there is a force/indefinite entity that will help us all if we let it.  Talk to it out loud if you feel the need to say thanks or please to nobody in particular..2) Self-care.  Thinking/saying "I'm a piece of shit" "I'm a failure" "I don't deserve____" isn't going to help me.  "I have positive qualities that I need to cultivate and emphasize" is going to get me out of bed to try.  It's going to have me around people reasonably presentable doing something that might help myself or others. .3) Patience.  Rome was not built in a day.  All I get done some days is just barely staying sober.  Those are less regular at this point but early on there were a lot of those days.  Some other days I have passed tests gotten paid better than ever before repaired things or relationships... who knows what it is building towards.  Every day my counter climbs I am *building something* even if it is just my resolve...I wish you luck and IWNDWYT.  
Thank you. I prayed this morning and I'm agnostic. It's just so hard and I don't want to die this way. I don't. 
I know exactly how you feel. I am in a similar place - I can make it 5-6 days but never longer. I am frustrated and terrified. But I will keep trying. I will not give up. And I will not drink with you today!
I had no clue how to stay sober without the help of AA and a therapist. It sounds like you could use more support. Keep trying!
