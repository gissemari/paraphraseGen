It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Struggle:** A few days ago I was waiting to get on a plane to fly to Florida and I fainted. There was no graceful swoon like in the movies it was sudden and it was not attractive. One moment I was standing in line with my carry-on and the next moment I was unconscious on the floor of the San Francisco Airport...It was 3:30 in the morning and I hadn't slept or eaten in hours. I am hoping that was what caused it and not a progression of my MS...**Triumph:** I got myself to Florida without doing what I would have done in the past after causing a public scene namely making a beeline for the nearest airport bar. My layover was in Las Vegas and I saw a gambling room in that airport where you could bring a drink from the bar next-door and smoking was also permitted. Back when I was drinking I would have been all over that place. Sober me just walked on by with my bottled water. ..**General:**  We are all in the gutter but some of us are looking at the stars.   Oscar Wilde. .
----------immediate responses--------

**Struggle**: still trying to be ok with the boring patches during the week. Little stretches of time that I used to just fast forward through. ..**Triumph**: turned down unlimited free beer and liquor at a musical event last night. It's generally true nobody gives a shit if I'm drinking or not...**General**: my dog prefers me to be sober he gets longer walks and I remember to fill his food dish last thing before bed...Thanks for posting SFGM and I hope that little fainting spell was just low blood sugar.
**struggle** trying desperately to write these 4 new pages by friday and I just feel woefully inept. I'm tired  I'm fuzzy headed I have a mountain of work and no time to do it...**triumph**  is there one today? ticked over to 9 on my little tally app. so thats. something.  ..**general** I need to find a way to communicate more effectively. I had a really irritating issue today where some co workers wanted to deploy some code I asked my code be included and I was just across-the-board ignored by all of them. its like I was invisible. its so frustrating. I want to ask them the next time they're patting themselves on the back for being inclusive and not a boys club when the last time they were just not acknowledged like that. its so fucking rude.
**Struggle:** Didn't go to a meeting today first meeting I planned on going to I got the wrong address (unless it was secretly being run in a Sears surplus appliances store and I didn't realize it). Backup meeting I drove to in sketchy Icy weather and it had been canceled. I'll go to one tomorrow but still...**Triumph:** Made a lot of efforts to go to meetings / do *something* for my recovery. Normally I'd just use today's series of circumstances to play Fallout...**General:** I have a kitten Hank and I'm very proud of him. Also I'm reading *Blood Meridian* for the third time in as many months.
Struggle: went for a run after being home with my kid all day but came home totally craving a beer then had to continually decide to not drink as my husband was drinking and kept leaving open beers in my vicinity (as he chased around said child).Triumph: in bed ate a healthy meal and stretched instead of drinking had nice kid snuggles and read extra stories for bedtime.General: Feeling gratitude at small things instead of negative about everything else for a few moments tonight that is kind of cool.
Oh no Mary.  That's scary.  I do hope it was just low blood sugar.  Yikes...**Struggle:** Stress is building.  We're understaffed at work and I'm not keeping up like I want to.  I hate getting behind and buried.    I need to get balance back. ..**Triumph:** Getting stuff looked at by the docs in the next week.  Hopefully they can get surgery scheduled and I'll be living with less pain in the future.  It feels good to address these issues I've been putting off for years...**General:**  Spring is finally here!  So long winter don't let the door hit you in the ass....
Struggle: had a rough day at work and barely slept. Not like I can take a nightcap is it?..Triumph: Decided to change my career and am really enjoying my course so far. Ask in 6 months about how I feel though! I couldn't do this and drink...General: I'm more confident and less agreeable. This is sometimes causing conflict but hey ho. Growth hurts...
Struggle: When I read posts about a year or multiple years sobriety my brain shuts down. I can't picture myself ever reaching that. Is that normal...Triumph: New trick is eating at restaurants with no alcohol licence..General: Its hard for me to get excited about 30 days anymore. I've done this before multiple times over the last 4 years and it never sticks. Each time my drinking gets progressively worse afterwards and it just seems like a completely pointless endeavour at this point. 
**Struggle:** This week I've been afraid of going outside of my apartment. Not anything dramatic just my heart rate rises and then I feel nauseous.  ..**Triumph:** I went to the grocery store and I've been going to school. I've been talking to people at school.  ..**General:** I think I will be normal next week.
**Triumph:** I'm still sober...**Struggle:** We had a drip-drip leak behind the kitchen sink which slowly rotted the worktop carcasses. The whole lot has been ripped out and a new kitchen is being put in but living without a kitchen has it's challenges...**General:** I am afraid of giants. The medical term for this is Feefiphobia...
Struggle: went out with coworkers tonight and before I left all I could think about was how I wanted a big glass of red wine...Triumph: I imagined what would happen if I had that  one  glass and then imagined how yummy a cranberry soda would taste instead.  I used skills I learned here on SD and WAS TOTALLY FINE. amazing. No one asked why I wasn't drinking even though we were at a brewery...General: It's totally random but I'm feeling more at peace with being in my 30s than I ever have. I think the not drinking has something to do with it. 
Struggle: I'm going to be tempted today. It isn't that I have an urge to drink per se but it's a very special occasion (and a happy one) and I have an apathetic feeling towards drinking... like where I want to celebrate. But I really don't want to reset my badge. I'll ask for non-alcoholic stuff I suppose...Triumph: Got through a major disappointment 2 weeks ago without liquor. The urge came back very hard. I took some kava to take the edge off the anxiety and just fought back...General: I'm falling in love with one of our traveling sales girls who lives 1000 miles away. She feels the same but she's scared for a variety of reasons. We're both emotionally invested but it's perilous. It's definitely added some much needed flavor to my state of existence even if it's bittersweet.
Struggle: there are a lot of variables in my life and pieces at play right now. It's causing my anxiety to rear up which means the little voice telling me a drink might be ok is getting louder..Triumph: I got through a reunion of sorts alcohol free..General: my cat has taken to sleeping on my head. 
Struggle: I have been recovering from Influenza B which turned into pneumonia.  I haven't been to a meeting in two weeks and it has me feeling out of sorts...Triumph: life has been rough lately.  I'm still sober that's enough...General:  I need to get back to eating clean.  I've been in survival mode since getting sick and I feel sick tired and depressed again.
Struggle: Sick stepkiddo not a lot of sleep missed my morning run because I was too tired...sigh. ..Triumph: I started a sober instagram account! I'm not sure if it's appropriate to link it here. I am happy to share and very excited about it!..General: Dog wants to go on a second walk this morning. I suppose I'll oblige. 
Fucked up last night. Day 1 today. I'm not beating myself up about it.  New day  and new start. 
.**Struggle:** Waking up in the morning. Getting out of bed is the hardest part - it's like I just want to sleep and not try and work. ..**Triumph:** Getting past ADHD at work. Every 5 seconds I have to remind myself to remain on task. The productivity builds up and removes some stress I have about my work performance...**General:** Have drank less these past three months than I have for any past three months in the last seven years. The trend is upward 
Happy snow day Wednesday--again. I'm so grateful I have no reason to venture outside today or tomorrow for that matter! I have a full day of work I can do from my couch as I watch the snow and sip green tea. Maybe I'll bake a coffee cake and cheat a little on my sugar ban... One thing I won't be doing today is drinking! Happy to be sober with you today!
Hey Mary I'm glad that fainting didn't turn out to be anything else! The lack of sleep and food could definitely do it. Glad you got to FL safe - hope you enjoy the trip :)...**Struggle(s):**     Sinus infection. Never-ending-Nor'easters. Kitchen gutted and under construction due to said Nor'easters. Throwing MIL's 81st bday party (in lieu of all these struggles) on Sunday. I'm missing they gym...**Triumph:**     Managed to get to the doctor prescribed antibiotics made MIL a beautiful 100 pic photo album as a gift still taking care of Mom and somehow getting her to dialysis at 4AM...**General:**     I'm not looking forward to shoveling 14" of snow with said sinus infection with no help. Gahhh...I'll save this for the Ventomatic!

**Struggle:** Health work and money. Ugh. I m on the evening shift in a couple of hours and sorely need some sleep first. But before that I have to pick up the car from a freakishly expensive extended service...**Triumph:** I just had my favourite drinking food for lunch and didn t think about drinking until I was nearly done...**General:** The magazine I edited has arrived from print and is currently being distributed. The responses so far are unanimously super nice. I m stoked!
Struggle:  I still want that drink... I still want the ability to moderate - be normal on occasion. I miss the flavor and the buzz. I just do...Triumph:  Despite many temptations stresses liquor store drive-by's &amp; boring periods I have managed to hang on to this sobriety thing...General:  I really need to exercise my body. I know it will help and I'll feel better AND perhaps I can kick high blood pressure to the curb as well. 
Struggle: having constant bouts with low-volume lizard voice for the past week springing up at me when I am not expecting it. Also having my exH and other scary people back in my dreams again really not fun. Hopefully just a phase...Triumph: bugger the lizard - I'm still not giving in. My local sober support stopped by for a chat this week and asked me how many days now - his positive comments really made me feel like I am gaining ground regardless of the lizard. He says it is normal. ..General: I had forgotten what I sound like when I genuinely laugh. It's the kind of deep chortle that makes other people laugh just hearing it. I seem to be doing a lot more of it along with wise-cracking smart-assing and punning. It's fun and I am often having clients laughing with me on the phone  :)..
S: I woke up this morning thinking about trying to not buy wine this afternoon once I finish my tasks. It might be a rough day...T: I'm making plans to stay sober. Real plans like what I'm going to do this afternoon to stay sober. I've been cleaning my baseboards. A little more wouldn't hurt...G: I had several fun sex dreams last night...lol. i really love being sober and remembering my dreams.
Struggle  -  Still not found my mojo to exercise..Triumph  -  being more spontaneous and surprised my hubby with theatre tickets for a date night tonight (quite expensive but only what I would have spent in a couple of weeks on drink in the past!)..General  -  fed up with winter - spring is taking to long to appear!
Struggle: it's still early days but my energy is still low haven't seen an improvement in my stomach issues and feel very tense during the day. Planning on trying yoga this week to help...Triumph: my husband seems to think moderation is best(I've always been his drinking buddy). But last night I told him that my sober path was open ended. I haven't put an end date on it because I need to see where this goes. It was not easy to say but I did it...General: I'm reading This Naked Mind and find it interesting but haven't gotten to an AHA moment. But I'm on chapter 7 and have a ways to go. Hoping there is a hook soon.
**Triumph:** I got my second mala in time for the equinox. It's gorgeous. It's also an interesting process. My teacher has a couple standard questions maybe a short conversation and then one day she'll let you know it's ready. The explanation of her thoughts intention and symbolism pf the mala is a fascinating mirror into how someone who knows me well within a very narrow context of yoga practice sees me...**Struggle:** Overwhelmed at work. Stress is a major trigger for me. I'm handling it ok so far but am being very vigilant. That in itself is stressful :/..**General: SPRINGTIME!!!***
**Triumph:** The past couple weeks I've been feeling very very attractive. I think it may have something to do with incorporating some lifting into my workout routine. The first time I deadlifted I pulled 8 reps of 185 which was way more than I was expected. My struggle below is interfering with my triumph a bit but I still feel pretty attractive right now...**Struggle:** I wasn't able to adopt my cat this weekend :(  I've also had a hard time controlling my sweet tooth and it's put my cutting on hold until I can reign it in. It's better than booze but still.....**General:** My phone completely died on me the weekend so I'm phoneless for the majority of the week. It's been pretty great all things considered. Dissociating from technology is nice once in a while.
Struggle: Sleep is still difficult during this adjustment period...Triumph: I've stuck to a clean diet for about a week now and have been slowly increasing the intensity of my workouts...General: Kenobi you are a bold one.
**Struggle** Today is day 1. Again. I'm really struggling with low self worth...**Triumph** Well...I'm here...**General** Today is going to be very busy and I am grateful for the distraction.
Struggle: Stuck in the house for a second day due to weather.  I get "antsy" sitting in the house for long periods of time and I don't care much for the feeling of isolation...Triumph: I will be making a meeting today even if that means walking in bad weather...General: If it snows enough today(very likely) I may be able to get outside and snowshoe for the first time in 2 years.  Snowshoeing is one of my favorite outdoor activities so that is exciting.
Triumph: 24 hours sober. .Struggle: off work to day good reason to drink. I will not drink today hour by hour..General:the sun seems brighter today. I will not drink this morning but take a walk in the sunshine   instead.
Struggle: Just moved to a new city and feeling all the loneliness and homesickness. I drank last night and I'm feeling pretty crappy about it. ..Triumph: Going to find some meetings tonight. Kind of exciting to go to a new one in a new place...General: Thank god I have a supportive husband. He's so patient and encouraging. 
Struggle: On Monday night I went to a pub before a concert and felt an overwhelming craving for beer. I had to ask for a table far away from the bar. I couldn't even smell it. This week I've been crying every night; angry at my addiction which feels regressive but par for the course. ..Triumph: Not only did I not drink (and chose red bull at the concert instead) I also reached out to my friend in AA who's been sober for 3 years and just talked out my feelings. My instinct is to always been quiet because I've never really asked for help before but it really helped to open up to her. ..General: I'm feeling optimist about my future sobriety. I'm scared but excited by the prospect of getting to relearn how to enjoy the parts of life I've been missing. ..IWNDWYT  
Struggle: My 85 year old grandma had a stroke and can't talk or move really.  I guess she opens her eyes when you yell her name but that's about it.  We are driving up tonight to see her and I'm trying not to be resentful that everyone will be there.  I just wanted to go and sit with my grandma for a while in peace.  But now my sister is coming and my aunt is flying in and I understand that everyone wants to see her but I just feel a little disappointed and I feel bad about that.  Brought my car in to fix a thing that I've noticed before driving up north and it will cost $800.  ..Triumph:  Last night I was really edgy and upset between the money grandma anticipating spending time with family when I was hoping for some alone time.  I wanted to break a handful of pencils in half.  I honestly thought if it would be weird to buy a stock of pencils and just break them when I was upset. I really wanted to drink get high and eat everything.  Just numb out.  I didn't.  I cross stitched dug out and read some letters my grandma had sent me in the past wrote in my journal and cried.  I'm pretty proud of myself for this. ..General:  Read [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/magazine/does-recovery-kill-great-writing.html?smid=tw-share) on Monday and have been thinking a lot about the mythos of the drunk writer/artist and how it's so romanticized but in reality these larger than life figures had the same hangovers regrets and beer shits as the rest of us.  Do we need this darkness to be creative?  Does being drunk allow us to access a side that's not afraid to create?  The roar of drunkenness seems to tune out everything else and takes us so much time that for me at least there's little room to fit any art in.  Orson Welles said to Frank Oz that "Some people create out of experience I create out of innocence" and that really stuck with me.  Also this quote from the article linked above:  "If life means anything at all it means whatever it means every hour every minute through any episode big or small if only one has the awareness to sense it ... each step the dramatic and the humdrum alike   every fleeting second of the way."..Probably too much for a What's Up Wednesday but I'm feeling it. 
Struggle: to not medicate with alcohol today's soreness from wrecking my bike yesterday...Triumph: reminding myself that alcohol just increases inflammation and prolongs/delays the healing process... And choosing to not drink today!..General: there's a lot of snow outside
[removed]
Oh /u/sfmarygirl I hope you are okay now. I'm so glad you made it to your destination safely.  Jeez!
Triumph:  Made it through a weeklong cruise without drinking. Achievement unlocked. A Jamaican literally tried to pour Vodka into my mouth at one point. ...Struggle:  I'm glad to be back to my life but this morning dealing with a dramatic ten year old who didn't want to go to school and was in the worst pain from a headache that anyone has ever felt I wanted to be back on the cruise ship watching the sunrise. ...General:  Hope all is well Mary. Hopefully low blood sugar or just one of those weird random one time incidents that are never explained but never reoccur. 
Struggle: The eight and five year old are on spring break this week and I work from home. They're energetic and curious of course but that usually leads to less productivity. This is usually a big trigger for me to count down the hours until I can block everything out with alcohol...Triumph: I haven't been drinking! I'm finding myself to be a lot more patient as well as having the energy to head off some issues instead of waiting for them to happen...General: I've been staying up later this week maybe just to get some time to myself or with my wife sans children. But I still feel better in the mornings than waking up hungover...Also wow my kitchen flooded too. There's a lot of kitchen issues in this thread.
**Struggle:** Too many minor struggles to choose which one to discuss. In the grand scheme of things I can't complain so I'll leave it there...**Triumph:** Got certified for adult CPR/AED by the Red Cross last week. Am on the road to becoming a group fitness instructor again...**General:** It's still cold here in central MN but I'm glad Spring is here. Seeing the temps creep up even slowly is a huge relief.  .
Struggle: keep finding myself thinking about having a beer after work and consciously having to refute that little voice of addiction. ..Triumph: I am having less and less down days and my depression seems to be getting better after almost 2 months of being clean and joined a rock climbing gym to replace my time at the bar. Definitely a happier and much more encouraging circle than before. ..General: went over my blood tests with the doc and turns out my liver was affected by my 10 year stint with booze but the numbers are within range to bring back to normal without treatment. Just told to keep up the good work. 
Truimph: Im in la with my partner for the next couple of days and having an amazing time sober too. Usually if im in LA i am drunk as hell. ..Struggle: my car broke down on the way home from a meeting two says ago and i dont have the money or time to fix it...General: 60 days is coming up and i want to treat myself with something nice but i cant decide what. My main options are; a laptop a bidet a vape or a water filter that filters out fluoride and chlorine.
Struggle: Several things but mostly depression &amp; the need for a new therapist but my depression &amp; my overwhelming work load right now means I haven't even bothered calling anyone...Triumph: Made it through my one year anniversary. My friends all went out to this really nice bar and invited me but I stayed home because it would have been way too tempting. ..General: Nothin'. Things are swings and roundabouts here. There's not a happy medium at the moment. 
Struggle: I live in the forever winter area of NY. And because of my DWI a year and a half ago take public transportation. Im 4 days sober and I really loath bus rides home now because I use to immediately drink after work at a bar next door while I waited for my first bus and then re-up on beers when I hit my connection bus stop. It numbed me from the suck of the cold...Triumph:  Mornings are easier and I enjoy my trip to work since I don't have a raging hangover. Also Im determined more than even to get my finances right and eventually drive again...General: Its my day off and im drinking green tea (which I haven't in over a year) took a natural liver cleanse pill since I care about my health now (figure that'll help get the healing process going from years of damage) and will eventually have a healthy body. Im also going to clean my apartment today and not drink with all of you!
Struggle: I am working from home today due to some winter weather. Which is actually great but I am finding myself creating a million excuses to drink. The cravings are strong...Triumph: This week I have been meditating more regularly and started using a new app I like. Even got my girlfriend to meditate with me yesterday. I also have not drank! 
**S:**  Exam tomorrow!  :(..**T:**  Then Spring Break!  :)..**G:**  Sometimes the Universe puts the smack down on us for no good reason.
Struggle: Quitting alcohol = wicked sugar cravings. SSRIs making me so sleepy may decide to quit them and just try to tolerate anxiety. Dodging responsibilities at work and school...Good stuff: Still sober! Generally succeeding at work. Beautiful blizzard today. Husband is my favorite person. Excited to go on a trip this weekend. Priorities falling into place. ..General: Time really does speed up as you age. So does appreciation for every moment. 
struggle: ocd flare is BAD. but moving soon and that should quiet my nerves...triumph: loved myself instead of buying candy to binge on...general: moving death broken heart all in a month?! i am doing it though. barely but doing it.
Struggle: had a slip up a few days ago and have really been kicking myself in the ass for it. Also have been soooo very emotional I know it's all hormone related after pregnancy stuff but it SUCKS. ..Triumph: I have a beautiful 6 month old girl I'm looking at that is the biggest blessing and reason to not drink ever. 
**Struggle:**  Last Wednesday I was laid off.  I didn't want to drunk; I desperately wanted a drink...I failed.  I had "one" glass of wine with dinner.  Then met a friend for a few more drinks.  Then stopped at my local bar for a couple more...What a mess...**Triumph:**  Those were the last drinks I've had.  I'm on Day 7 and feeling better than I have in a long time both about not drinking about my future job prospects and my health in general...I have a phone interview tomorrow with what could be the perfect job for me...**General:** *"If you think you can or think you can't - you're right."*  -- Henry Ford
Struggle: coping with the after effects of last week's relapse. My depression has been getting more serious...Triumph: It's been a week since the night of my relapse and I haven't had a drink since then :))) fuck ya 
Struggle: The day is winding down the kitchen is clean after dinner the 4 year old is off keeping herself busy... and god damn I want a beer. Just gonna fold the rest of this laundry...Triumph: Today was my day off and it was actually productive fell behind on a few things this past week...General: Cant' wait for nicer weather.
Struggle: My husband is still drinking and I don't know how to react to him. I'm often hostile then feel terrible because he has cancer and one of the reasons I stopped drinking was to be there for him..Triumph: I set up some positive activities this week but then part of me kept wanting to get out of doing them. I stayed with the program though and consistently felt better afterwards..General: It's great to remember what I read at night!
**Struggle**: Have fallen into the most noticeable depression/anxiety/dissociation since I quit. This is typical for me just before 90 days and I am at 80 days. It's also typical for me when change is happening in my life. Which brings me to... .**Triumph**: I got a fancy job in my industry! Pay is slightly lower than expected but it is still more than I have ever made before. The people there seem great and I'm hopeful that this will be a place I am happy at. .**General**: Even though I feel like I have not drinking under control and haven't had bad cravings I feel in a vulnerable and unpredictable place right now. When it comes to managing my emotions and making sure I stay sober I am still taking it one day sometimes one hour at a time.
Struggle: constantly thinking about having one drink just to take the edge off life. Thinking "one drink won't hurt." Yeah right. ..Triumph: Sober for 9 days. My goal is to not crave alcohol. ..General: To stay and maintain this sobriety takes a  lot of effort physically and mentally but at the end of the day I'm happy and I didn't hurt anyone with my drunk selfishness. 
Struggle: I'm back on my diet which is making me feel better already but I'm still feeling the urge to totally binge out on junk food...Triumph: food cravings are taking my mind off drink cravings almost completely. Like if I'm going to crack then I'm going to devour a cheeseburger rather than a bottle of vodka. Also I have a job interview this week...
Struggle: unrelated to sobriety outside of its usually being a trigger but my social anxiety. I have had a grueling last two weeks of business meetings where i had to be ON...and - .Triumph: even though i was seriously wound up after each one i didnt drink. Tonight was the last one and im enjoying a cup of hot tea. I feel like i just went through midterms. Usually I'd be half in the bag right about now..What was the last thing we were sharing on? Anyway glad to be here instead of on a booze fueled anxiety crash. Love to all!
Struggle: still haven't found a job yet. And my teenage son is kind of isolating himself...Triumph: there are people that want to hire me and I have about three offers on the table...General: snow day today so I did NOTHING. It was kind of nice. Looking forward to the gym and being slightly productive tomorrow.
Struggle: I feel very lethargic and depressed lately not sad necessarily I just don't have the energy or motivation to do much of anything at all except sleep all day...Triumph: Continuing to do well in my classes setting up a research project for the summer. I also haven't gone this long without a drink in recent memory. Today is the sixth day. ..General: I need myself together to clean up my apartment and get it looking nice again so I can cook healthy meals for myself.
