Hi all..First post in this sub.  If you look at my history I've mostly posted about a devastating breakup brought about mainly by my drinking and how it made me treat my now ex how I looked at life dealt with frustrations etc.  ..I won't lie it's been rough.  The not drinking part has been so far relatively easy although I quit for 2 months after she moved out on a one day notice then relapsed when I had to move and my situation got a lot more "real".  This ended the reconciliation attempt and she promptly fell into the arms of another man who she says she wants to marry...That aside I feel pretty good about being able to stay sober this time.  Of course it always an ongoing battle but for the last month I've been so distraught over the relationship I haven't given a thought to drinking if that makes any sense.  I know what it has cost me while I work on forgiving myself and letting go...I guess one of the things I had overlooked over the last month while I've been so torn up about the breakup is getting sober and feeling all the feelings I used to drown with vodka at the same time has been very very difficult.  That being said it's taught me to explore a lot of coping skills and mechanisms that I never had before...This is kind of a rambling post.  I guess I just realized this morning when I was like "Oh yeah it's 30 days" and wondering why I've been having such a hard time dealing with this breakup it just occurred to me "because you're not drinking away the pain for once ya big dummy".  That and it was a committed relationship that was amazing at one point with an amazing woman.  ..If I can do it you guys and girls can do it too.  I'm 51 and I have at least 25 years of drowning my feelings with alcohol and sometimes drugs.  Gonna take a minute for things to calm down and I'm not an emotional basket case.

&gt; feeling all the feelings I used to drown with vodka at the same time has been very very difficult..Me too friend.  Learning how to deal with them was pretty important.  Letting myself feel the good ones was important if that makes any sense.
Congrats on 30 days! That is huge! ..On the feelings/emotions front I know what you mean. We've been spending so much time hiding from them with alcohol we basically have to start the process of learning how to deal with them now and it's rough. ..I will say it does get better. Day 90 or so was really rough for me but I'm coming out of it and each day I get better at it and you will too. ..One thing that's been a helpful mantra for me is "Feelings are just visitors let them come and let them go." Meaning go ahead and feel the thing but don't dwell on it a feeling is passing and it will end although maybe not as quickly as we might like sometimes. ..&amp;#x200B;
