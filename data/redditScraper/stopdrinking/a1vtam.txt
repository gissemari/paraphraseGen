I don't know why this time has been so hard for me. I think it might be that the fantasy of being able to moderate one day was completely shattered by my last relapse. Coming to terms with that almost feels like grieving a life I will never be able to have. I recently watch  Don't Worry He Won't Go Far On Foot  and the line that really stuck with me was  Poor me poor me eventually turns into pour me another drink . Self-pity and self-centeredness are obstacles I'm working to overcome. Hell my life is pretty damn amazing. So what if I can't have alcohol? I honestly think a life without peanut butter would be worse (sorry to any with nut allergies out there). Acceptance and gratitude: these are what I'm striving for. Just for today no matter what I won't drink.

Good god can I relate to this. I am feeling exactly the same. Trying so hard to work and do all the things I'm supposed to and have gratitude because things are good and I am lucky. But I also can't ever drink again - have had scary relapses 3 times in 6 months. I want to feel free and happy but I too am mourning my relationship with the poison that gave me the temporary illusion I was free and happy. I don't even feel like I like anyone anymore let alone myself. .IWNDWYT good luck to you   
It was a terrible relationship anyways.  Good riddance once the tears are gone and life keeps going on and lo and behold it gets better- even better- without it hanging around mooching off us all the time.  iwndwyt  (like... sometimes there will be a moment where I think I miss my old roommate but I really don't.  I really don't.  He lied about everything all the time but he was company and it's the company itself I sometimes miss.  And he still owes me money.  &lt;*shakes  a fist at the sky*&gt;)
