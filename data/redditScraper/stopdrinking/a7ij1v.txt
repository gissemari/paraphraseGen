It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-----------------------------------------..**Struggle:** I used to go into mild withdrawal on an airplane flight when I had to go for more than a hour or two without drinking so I knew all the ins and outs of bars at different airports. I knew for example that at one bar at Tampa Airport the bartenders will put your drink in a plastic cup and you can take it  to go  onto the plane with you. I once booked a layover in Baltimore instead of Philadelphia because I knew that the airport had a wine bar that I liked...I knew which bars at San Francisco Airport opened at six a.m. sharp so I could have several drinks before a morning flight. I tried to pretend I was just a nervous flyer who didn't really drink except before getting on a plane but I wasn't fooling anyone. Once the guy sitting next to me looked at my early morning mixed drink and said sarcastically  Breakfast of champions!  Even the bartender looked sorry for me...**Triumph:** These days I'm flying across the country and back about once a month and my whole way of being in an airport has changed. I now know which airport has the best coffee shop (Denver) and which has the best noodle joint (Los Angeles). I've even discovered airport art galleries and recently saw a great exhibit of assemblage pieces at Albany Airport while waiting for my flight. I have discovered that are many things for me to do at an airport other than go to a bar...(If any of you know of any airports with great amenities I hear there's a yoga room at Chicago/Midway! please let me know.)..**General:** My public spoken response to invitations to boozy Christmas parties where excessive drinking is how people plan to celebrate is:  No thank you.  My private unspoken response is:  Santa is an anagram of Satan and the answer is  Not today Satan. Not today.' .
----------immediate responses--------

I really liked your post and I'm new to the group. this looks like a great group!
**Struggle:** Woke up with a very sore throat and overall feel like shit at the moment. I even called out for tomorrow but the boss lady found something to fill my shift at my 2nd job...**Triumph:** I still pulled myself together this morning and went to my other job and did my 8 hour shift. Thankfully I don't have to do a lot of talking and was able to sit on my ass for most of the day...**General:** Old drunk me would have used the sore throat to call out from my 1st job. I then would have called job #2 and told them I wouldn't make it in tomorrow and then I would have went to the store and bought at least 10 25oz beers which would have only dehydrated me which most likely would have resulted in me calling out on Thursday to both jobs and then getting drunk again...Instead when I left work I drove to the store purchased some Mucinex and here I sit sober feeling like shit and while I might not sleep great I won't be hungover in the morning...IWNDWYT

Glad you're here!
*triumph* I am proud of my kid for her achievements with school - but I am also really proud of myself right now for NOT deciding it was a good reason to have a glass of wine [i.e a bottle or two...because it's never "just one"]. I have felt the inclination [it's not every year your kid finishes their first major stage of education it's Christmas lead-up I'm wrapping up client projects it's hot and humid it's on special etc etc] but I haven't acted on it. And I am really really proud of myself...*struggle* like /u/sfgirlmary said Santa is an anagram of Satan and damn he's busy this time of year. But so far my will is proving tougher than the drinkies demon...*general* 15 days until one year. I seriously think I might be anticipating that with even greater excitement than Christmas!.
**Struggle:** I am still eating too much and would love to lose a bit of weight as well as to start running again. ..**Triumph:** While I still at times feel the desire to drink I am able to look at my craving objectively separating from who I am as a person and seeing how much destruction and havoc my drinking has caused in my life. In that sense I am making some progress and am feeling stronger every day. I am looking forward to a sober holiday season!..**General:** I have a few essays that I need to start/work on/finish for my last(!) year of university. Trying to schedule my time productively even though I am technically on break. 
Happy Wednesday all!..&amp;#x200B;..**Struggle:** The stigma of *not* drinking is baffling me. I told my mum last night that I'm 2 weeks without alcohol and she got upset at the thought of me not drinking alcohol again. Not even at Christmas? No. Not at New Year? No. Birthday? No. Do you want one now? Yes a Becks Blue please...**Triumph:** Attending a gig at the weekend and staying dry (the support from my best friend and drinking buddy was so surprising and refreshing) the fact I've made it 2 weeks for the first time in my adult life and the best week of sleep since I was a kid!..**General:** I know there's a long road ahead of me now but I'm coming to terms gradually with the idea of not drinking. The anxiety is fading and the thought of living a happy sober life is becoming more and more comforting to me day after day.
The best airport coffee is at DIA? Who knew??..Personally I love the B gates at Dulles; there's a Chipotle right by the escalators out of the terminal. We almost always grab a burrito on our way out. &lt;insert pig emoji here&gt;
Struggle: had a lot of anxiety going into work today for the first time since quitting drinking (only 3 days ago). I had the night shift (start at 3pm) and would normally deep clean some part of the kitchen. Usually if I had only a  night split I would get hammered the night before fall asleep... sometime and only get out of bed at 2:30pm. Somehow I'd  make it through service and then feel alright. Alright enough to buy more beer and "treat myself" for making it through...Triumph: deep cleaning behind deep fryers sucks but it's some much easier doing it sober. Service is so much easier too. I'm happier and talking to people is easier sober then perpetually hungover. ..General: now I'm at home eating a shitty microwave meal and I'm sober. I am slowly becoming the person I should have been a long time ago and I will not drink today :)
Hi sfgirlmary. I don't travel all the time but I can relate to the stories of always drinking in airports. I'm from Tampa and am familiar with the bar you mentioned. When my SO and I would get to the airport it was almost a competition to see how many we could knock back before our flight. I won't miss those occasions (having to pee during take off sucks!). ..STRUGGLE: Turning to food in place of drinking. It doesn't help that it is the holiday season and everywhere I go there are sweet treats. I also know I use food as an emotional escape in a similar way I used alcohol and weed. I'm working through this and hopefully I can start to replace bad habits (sitting down and bingeing taco bell while watching tv) with good ones (thoughtfully cooking a new healthy meal with my SO while listening to music or podcasts)...TRIUMPH: I have 10 days today and I'm proud of that. I had one serious temptation at my mom's holiday party but used HALT to assess what I was really feeling. Hungry Angry Lonely Tired has been so useful for me the past few times drinking has crossed my mind. I'm so grateful for that...GENERAL: Christmas shopping and planning and traveling has me stressed out but overall I am so grateful to have so many loved ones to buy for and see during the holidays. I don't know what my life would look like without them. ..Thank you SD! I love you all!!
Struggle:  Lately I've had persistent low level cravings thoughts of drinking nostalgia fantasies you name it. Btw caution to anyone watching the latest season of The Ranch.  I think it might have helped precipitate all this. You've got depressing material the characters drinking non stop and music in the background about drinking!  (There's one country song with chorus that literally consists of:  Drink a beer )  For fuck's sake!...Triumph:  Well I've carried on. The logic and the wealth of facts and science I have armed myself with and fortified myself with and this community and the time I spend here each day the fear of a badge reset have all gotten me through. It really hasn't been close. No close calls just thoughts that disturb me and that haven't seemed to go away. I believe now they are fading or I'm getting used to them. And I know they won't last forever. ...General:  it's nice not to be shaking while you are waiting for the flight attendants to get to your seat with the drink cart.  But I still wait impatiently for my Diet Coke!
Struggle: I'm feeling very tired apathetic and groggy lately..Triumph: Still not drinking. I have probably finished more books this year than any year since high school.
**S:**  The usual: still haven't gotten my nursing license ex puppy single parenting.....**T:**  I've been doing yoga everyday and I've been able to almost eliminate otc painkillers...**G:**  One time before a turbulent flight to SF I ate a half dozen Krispy Kreme donuts.  Wouldn't recommend..
Struggle: Someone who I considered my closest friend has been MIA and generally nonsupportive since I told her I had quit drinking. When confronted she got super mad and accused me of jumping to conclusions. I helped her through the loss of her husband in 2014 and just expected some reciprocity I guess. And then I feel stupid about my expectations. Gah!..Triumph: Went out to eat Mexican last night for the first time since I quit and managed to NOT throw a fit when they told me they didn't serve virgin margaritas. I muscled through and managed to enjoy my chips salsa and queso without a drop of tequila even with my husband sitting across from me with his frosty mug. It's amazing how often mild irritations would throw me into fits when I was drinking. So much for being a relaxant!..General: Emotions are weird slippery suckers that I have been actively numbing for 25 years. I emailed a therapist I trust and will begin seeing her again next year. I had a really shitty childhood and know some bad shit is coming but I'm prepared with a plan.
Struggle: I have a cold and am recovering from a dental operation that leaves me with stitches and a ban on moving on my lower lip for the next ten days...Triumph: I didn't drink yesterday and I plan on doing the same today..General: Well holidays i guess looking forward to seeing family and whatnot.
**Struggle:** My brother and two of my good friends are struggling right now and know I'm getting sober so I've accidentally become a guru of sorts all of the sudden. I'm not sure I'm ready to help others yet but I love these people and I want them to get better. So finding boundaries right there is a bit of a struggle. Also I'm visiting my Mom who is going through Chemo right now. She's doing pretty well but it's a low grade stressor that nags at my mood and energy. I worry a bit about the holidays being "fun" enough given this situation.  I've also struggled to tell people what's going on and be truthful about why I'm not drinking...**Triumph:** Motherfu--ing PINK CLOUD. I feel awesome. I'm working out all the time high energy sleeping well really digging into my sobriety and optimistic about what life can be. I'm ambivalent about the situation I mentioned above because part of me sees it as a triumph that people I care about are reaching out to ME of all people about sobriety. That's pretty amazing. Also I was wearing black workout clothes at the gym the other day and someone asked me if I was a trainer. I'm like ME? A TRAINER? LOL. But I was extremely flattered...**General:** I've got so much energy to do things and be helpful and go to visit mom and come back and christmas shop and work and play with the dogs and exercise and go to social events and dinners and cook and clean and and and and and and and. This is the best part about my decision to drink. i'm actually excited to do stuff even stuff that used to suck.
Struggle: Its day 3 after my second relapse. Feeling a little foggy and still mentally beating myself up for being in this position again...Triumph: I woke up bright and early drove a friend to the airport and stopped to grab coffee/breakfast to surprise my wife all before she woke up! She's still pretty upset about my relapse and untrusting but I'm still doing my best to show my love for her...General: Relapsing sucks. Returning to booze is not worth it no matter what your brain friends or anyone tells you. Recognize cravings think about how they feel and ride them like a wave until they pass. I let them get the best of me and didn't rely on anything I have learned or reached out to anyone I know. The booze wasn't worth it and ignoring how I felt and pretending to be strong when I wasn't ended up hurting me in the long run...As for today I will not drink with you!..
I recently got a massage at the Seattle airport.  I booked a 30 minute chair massage and it was fabulous!  I am a bit afraid of flying (or crashing really) and never thought I'd be able to make a flight without self-medicating with alcohol and pills.  But I'm coping just fine.  I do some breathing when flights get choppy and hang on tight...**Struggle:** Stress.  Finance stress work stress holiday gift stress household cleaning stress.  Blah.  I hate stress.  I wish I'd taken a week off for Christmas so I can catch up.  Instead I have more going on at work than usual and other obligations too.  ..**Triumph:** I got Christmas cards made and mailed off.  I still have some local ones to make but I'm mostly done...**General:** I hope 2019 is a better year.  This year was brutal.
Thanks for posting. I agree about not going to super boozy holiday parties. Even if I stay sober will I have fun? No...Triumph: I'm still sober!..Struggle: I hate this time of year. Not only the drinking but all the unhealthy food and getting out of my routine. And how dark it is outside. Ugh. I'll be glad when it's over.
Struggle: two people very close to me were separately checked into psych wards on suicide watch this past weekend.  One seems to be considerably improved after talking to professionals and adjusting medication but the other isn't good at all.  I think we're in for some difficult conversations in the coming days.  ...Triumph: I'm all ready for Christmas!  Presents are wrapped menu is planned guest room is set up.  I'm feeling great about it.  ...General: I was watching the Christmas special of 'Sabrina' on Netflix last night and she gave Harvey's dad enchanted eggnog that somehow makes him never want to drink again.  Where do I get some of that?
**Struggle:** Somehow I have been craving drinks more lately like a nice cocktail out. It would be so easy to have one drink right? But i'm SO CLOSE to almost 2 months and that drink will be 20 minutes of temporary numbness followed by physical illness no thank you. ..**Triumph:** Down 22# with calorie counting and sobriety feeling really good and having fun trying to meet my -2# goal per week like it's a game. .
Struggle: It's mid-morning as I type. I've already had a couple uncomfortable work meetings but none were terrible. I received sad but not unexpected news. My kids haven't been sleeping well which means I haven't either. I'm feeling down and it's shaping up to be a blah day...Triumph: Can you find a violin small enough to play for me? Feeling blah is my big issue? That's one of the great things about these regular posts--they help me see the progress I make. It's easy to lose sight of how far we've come when we're focused on the next steps so having an opportunity to reflect is important...u/sfgirlmary there was hype a while ago about a yoga center at Denver International but I can't see that it's open.
I enjoyed this post. Thanks ! 
Struggle: BOREDOM. I live in a shelter and do not currently work so my days are very long and mentally frustrating. I am trying to get back into video games and studying history but motivation is hard to find. I have issues with depression so thats definitely not helping any.  Anyone got tips on boredom and filling your days?..Triumph: I am on day 4 and I feel fucking confident at least 80% of the time. ..IWNDWYT
Ahhhhh I so connect with your post about airports. One of my biggest challenges and one I'm still being so careful about. ..**Struggle:** Going to one of my best friend's wedding on Friday with a big group of old friends and I'm stressing about it already. Planning is helping but I wish I could avoid these kinds of events for a few more months. I really can't miss this one though it's been planned for years and she is one of my closest friends. Oh and I don't have a dress to wear but whatever that's less of a struggle. ..**Trumph:** Cleaning shit out of my house! Drinking made me so much less efficient at well life. The house is cleaner I feel calmer and less stressed about the avalanche of crap that will rain down on my toddler twins from other family members this Christmas despite my best efforts gaarrrr. Donating stuff feels really good. ..**General:** I am finding a lot of movies/TV to be quite triggering as well as commercials. Really noticing the culture of alcohol and just how much it shows up in so many shows. Even in really basic sitcoms etc. 
Struggle - dating is just *weird* without booze. I'm still relatively new to this so maybe that changes but the social lubricant element of alcohol was always a big help. Everything seems that bit funnier and escalating from "getting on" to "making out" seems to just flow if you're both a bit loose from drinking. There's also the fact and this *might* just be in my head that the fact of me being a non-drinker in London is a bit unusual and often seems to weird people out a little. I think they find it more uncomfortable than me sometimes in fact. Hey ho I guess it's a case of working through this new reality. I've had a few flings in my sober time but it's been with girls who like to party which has been the downfall each time when they realise I'm not a guy they can get drunk or take drugs with on their nights out and that this sobriety is a long-term thing for me...Triumph - in various ways I am a vastly better dating prospect than I used to be. I am completely debt free with a decent chunk to invest in the new year once I've paid my tax bill. I had somewhere between  25-30k in personal credit card debt less than 3 years ago... I know right? I am in the best physical shape of my adult life with 6-pack decent musculature on target for 3200km running this year having broken my 5km and 10km PBs this year (16.44 and 36.50 since you asked!). I have various exciting new projects to get stuck into in the new year that should take me away from constantly working nights and weekends and allow me to have in-depth conversations with some truly fascinating and exceptional people and to help people in various ways all around the world and learn and grow myself a lot. I'm stable happy healthy and very optimistic...General - a lot of the time I drank in the vague hope that in my inebriation I would somehow get a girl by it making me more gregarious and outgoing. Sure that worked once in a while - but over time we're talking about maybe a 1% strike rate for that insane self-destructive method! More often I'd just get steaming and end up chatting shit with some other alcoholic or drug user til the early hours then be out-of-action most of the next day or two. Sobriety has gifted me a clarity a purpose an ability to follow through on that purpose and in time good things will ensue from the steps I am making in this positive direction I will adjust to the new norms I will meet more people who are on board with this way of living and the idea that getting steaming is a prerequisite to hooking up will seem even more ridiculous than it currently does.
Struggle:  The "Swedish Death Cleanse" to which I am committed  brings me face to face with both the wreckage and triumphs of the past.  The reason it's all been in storage for 12 years is that it's just been easier to pretend I'll deal with it tomorrow.  I've lived a long life as did my parents and my aunt before me (yep got some of their once priceless stuff to deal with to).  It seems insane to now be giving to charity stuff that I have paid to store all this time. There will be a sale at the end but it will probably not pay for the storage bill. ..Triumph:  Hey I'm here in "nevertheless she persisted" mode.  I do see humor in it too. For some reason all the presents I'm giving this year are ephemeral.  Food magazine subscriptions massage gift certificates.   And I'm really happy to see the unused office supplies go to teacher friends pet items go to the humane society and the general diminution of stuff! ..General:  We're having warm sunny weather which makes it so much easier to deal with. 
Struggle. I was 5 years sober. I relapsed last year. Ive been craving that sober life again while also craving the instant gratification of alcohol. This is day 3 and while I've had stretches of sobriety this last year it was only bc I was trying to convince myself I wasn't actually an alcoholic. This time feels different somehow. ..Triumph. I didn't go to the liquor store today. 
Struggle: Lots of social events. Unsupportive people  you won't last the week  etc. ..Triumph: Turning down drinks at work Xmas lunch today. Cancelling 2 nights out and an upcoming Xmas dinner (a very boozy one). ..General: It's cold I don't like it! Lol.
Struggle: tried to go to my first AA meeting today it was supposed to be an open all women's group according to the "find a meeting" website... No one showed up except a large group of older men who all seemed to know each other... no women. So I drove away. Disheartening but then again my expectations weren't exactly sky high. I'll just try again tomorrow. ..Triumph: I had a great day despite that. Had a deep conversation with my mom. Went to go see Mary Poppins Returns by myself for just a random wholesome treat to myself and I enjoyed it. ..Iwndwyt friends.
Triumph: today I had to take an unexpected work trip out of town. This happens very rarely but when it does I've always looked forward to having a few drinks at the bar alone with my book. I did go to the bar to enjoy pizza and water. I sat across from liquors and beers for  an hour and walked away with out any regrets. I'm eleven days sober and so proud of myself. The excitement of writing this comment was such a motivator. Thanks for being awesome...IWNDWYT
Struggle - it's my third day of sobriety . When I told my family/coworkers they thought I was joking at first and then took over /under bets on how long id last. ..Triumph- its my third day of sobriety. ..General- I have this weird and heightened sense of anxiety and dread in me. But at the same time I have some new feeling of  pride in my self and hope for the future  (for the first time in a very long time).   Just a very conflicting range of emotions I'm feeling right now . I feel like I've wasted my young adult life (16-25) just trying to get high and drunk . And because of that I've never really accomplished anything. Now I feel like I can accomplish things  when typically I always would  put my self down and  not even attempt certain things because I assumed I would fail . Hopefully this mindset will last. ..I've also quit weed at the same time as alcohol(smoked at least 5 joints a day) I know alcohol has worse physical withdrawals and cravings  but man am I itching for a joint . (Sorry if this is the wrong place for that) ..this has become a very rambling  comment and I don't know if any one will even read it or if I'm.Doing this right. But felt good just to type some of this stuff out. And happy I found this community . On that note  does anybody have any recommendations (besides this subreddit ) for alternatives to AA/ 12 step. I'm really off put by the heavy use of faith and god . Just curious if anyone has recommendations. ..Thanks 
**Struggle:** I'm without a job which is a big stressfactor at the moment. I don't know what type of job I want to do and I don't know where to start searching...**Triumph:** I've travelled alone to Australia and back. I live in Denmark so the travel is 30-35 hours including layovers. The longest flight was 13 hours and the staff went back and forth serving coffee tea water and alcohol. I realized how easy it was for me to start drinking especially since I didn't have any connection on the phone to call anyone to vent...I'm proud to say that I traveled both ways without a single drink!..**General:** Even though I'm without a job and I'm still very jet lagged I'm doing OK. I have the support of family and friends which I appreciate.
Struggle: I'm on annual leave but people at work trying to get me to do tasks before xmas/the end of the year forget about it mate. ..Triumph: I'm 7 months booze free now. ..General: i am home with my family it's nice.
