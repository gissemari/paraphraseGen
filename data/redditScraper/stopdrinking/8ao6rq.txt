Being young (currently 19) has never affected how I see myself I grew up 9 or so years younger than my peers (my cousins) but entering the sobriety community I feel like a fucking baby lol. I just relapsed tonight after 40some days and I KNOW I would be dead right now if I hadn't gotten clean this last time around but it is just so impossible with the pressures that surround young life. ..It's not even the obvious things like my friends partying they all accept and love me and keep everything low key when I'm around. But it's things like today when I was at a family party and was constantly offered drinks and was around my family drinking for the entire day why wouldn't they offer the  college boy  of the family some drinks? ..I withstood every temptation at the party today because i knew the second I took a sip I would be chugging whatever I could get my hands on in front of my grandparents which kept me sober. But the only reason I stayed sober was because I promised myself I would let myself break my sobriety tonight because today was so awful and that's what I've regretfully done. ..Just wanted to put this out there (not even really sure what I'm looking for) to maybe see if anyone who got sober young or is still young and struggling can resonate or offer advice.  ..I am confident that if this isn't a one night thing I will be at risk of dying in the next few weeks which is really scary to me because I know I'm too young and I don't have ANY of the wisdom I need to be handling this kind of life and death struggle at this age.  I just can't lose control again like I have in the past. I just don't know what to do. ..Either way love y'all so much please have a night filled with peace and love  .

We will be here when you are ready bud.  Make it sooner rather than later. 
I've removed this post as a rule here is that we all only participate when sober...You're welcome back tomorrow morning.
