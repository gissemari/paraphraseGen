So here I am on my 90th day. I know it's not that big of a deal but it's the longest I have gone without getting drunk since adolescence. Of course I am nowhere near my goal which is to get 500000 days but I am working on it. ..Was it hard? I really wish I could say that I struggled that I'm a hero and that it took the courage of five talking lions to get this far but I would be lying. I think it's about perspective. I have the same temptations urges stressors as other people but from my perspective this has been nothing but a gift. The benefits of not being a lush have been so staggering that it out-reinforces every other competing interest. Focusing on the positive gifts as opposed to the deprivation aspect has been critical. When confronted with even the notion of drinking my automatic thought is "And give all this up? Are you nuts?" In fact on the topic of "giving up" things I don't view myself as having "given up" anything; rather I am for the first time in years actually giving myself a gift and it's the best gift I have ever received. ..It should be noted that not drinking has not magically solved all of my problems. Far from it. It has however given me the ability to *see* my issues and for once in my life I actually have the *fucking time and energy* to work on them. ..Here are some ways my life has improved:..* **No more excuses.** Funny how when I was drinking I told myself I never had the time to do things. These "things" ran the gamut from minute chores to major life tasks. I had any manner of excuses for not doing laundry going to the gym making my lunches for work cleaning my place staying on top of my finances etc. Once I took a step back I realized that I did have an excuse: I was a sot. I was too exhausted from my "relaxation time" to get anything done. I now have zero excuses and those little things that add up to a normal life are all present and I am actually living the way a grown man should no excuses. ..* **Health**: Ever wonder what cutting out 80000 calories of beer from your weekly consumption will do? I don't need to hypothesize because I know. In conjunction I no longer have an excuse not to work out and I do so every day. Come to think on it the positive benefits from exercising have by far been the biggest boon. Three months ago I was barely fitting into my clothes (and I had very few clothes I could fit into at all). I looked like a pig swathed in tent canvas when dressed in my work clothes and I was embarrassed to go out in my casual clothes as I had so few that fit. I could *feel* the fat accumulating on me. Though I was not obese I was a pure slob. A mere 90 days of hard work later and this problem has completely evaporated (thanks /r/fitness FAQ). I dropped 15 pounds of fat and put on some muscle. Just last week I had to go to the tailor to get some shirts and suits taken in. *Taken in*. Goddamn it does it ever feel good to look in the mirror and see myself getting leaner by the day. I still have a lot of work to do but I love doing it so it doesn't feel like a chore. ..* **Diet**. When I was drinking I ate like an asshole. My hangovers and lack of energy led to my attitude toward eating to be along the lines of 'ME NEED FOOD NOW." Obviously I didn't have time to cook because I was so busy "unwinding" and then recovering from my "stress relief". I ate out all the time and of course I needed to reward myself for being "sick" from my hangovers. All of that has changed. I cook every day bring my lunches to work and am becoming a demon in the kitchen. Again I've a long way to go before I'm an Iron Chef but it feels awesome to be like "Yeah I made that motherfuckers. Who wants to fucking touch me?"..* **Fucking time**. I had to use the eff word here because this element is astounding. There are so many hours in a day days in a week and weeks in a month (four). For years I threw away so much of this time as if it was nothing. Every Saturday and Sunday morning many weeknights and most certainly weekend nights were boiled away with little positive residue left to show. It's no wonder I never got anything done! Since I changed I find my time passes slower like when I was a kid. This is not a bad thing. I have ample time to fulfill my obligations and even more time to actually work on improving my life. This has caused me to be much more relaxed. ..* **Relaxation**. They say one's ability to react is proportional to their ability to relax. I never had relaxation time before. There was no time for me. My time was for work and then for drinking. Sure I deluded myself into thinking drinking with the boys was how I relaxed but I wasn't. If anything I was stressing myself out more by spending too much money getting slobbier ignoring my obligations and pickling organs with booze. Now I actively relax. When I play video games it's because I've earned it. I book activities with friends and actually enjoy myself. I come home after a day of relaxing and feel tired content and happy for the first time in a long while. ..* **Cash money**. How much does 80000 calories of beer cost per week? A fucking lot. Combined with the lazy bought meals idiotic splurges and inattention to finances boozing was having a drastic effect on the ol' billfold. I was most often a social drinker which meant going out for beers. In my city you're hard-pressed to get a beer for under eight bucks. My favorite way of managing my finances was to not look at all the random no-name ATM receipts I accumulated from different bars. Since I stopped I meet all my obligations no sweat. I also have money left over. I'm saving for the first time in my life. You know like a fucking grown up.  ..Anyways I just wanted to share because then people would congratulate me and tell me what a good boy I am.

Congrats you're such a good boy! :P..Seriously though thanks for writing this. It's great to be reminded of the many blessings of sobriety.
You always 4 days ahead of me...  I mean congratulations! 
Congrats Link__!  I'll be there soon myself.  And it's been great for me too for all of the same reasons you mentioned here.

Thanks for the post - I just did the math based on what I was drinking... works out to about 4 pounds a week (14000 calories) - and just like you said that doesn't count all the shitty eating which is/was a huge problem for me when I drink...My head feels clear and for the first time in 3 years I actually lost weight this week. I can feel it in my clothes and see it on the scale that's been helping me stay on track. I can also see it in my bank account - I am so looking forward to saving up for a downpayment on a house now instead of spending it all on booze (about a grand/month...I'm shocked now that I see myself writing that...)...Keep up the good work thanks for the post!.
You sir are completely wrong. It is a very big deal indeed ... 
Jesus Christ we have had a lot of similar problems you really nailed it man If I can do half of what you have accomplished and are accomplishing through sobriety I'll be stoked. Thanks for sharing congrats on the 90days! Sounds like I have a lot to look forward too.
Holy crap what an inspiring post! You really refreshed in my mind a lot of things I take for granted and I got all thankful all over again just reading through it...Congrats and nice job but more than that thanks for taking the time to share what its all meant to you.
Right on. Awesome post. Congrats man you're an inspiration.
