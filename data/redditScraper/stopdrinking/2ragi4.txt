I've been running for over three years. First it was a shoplifting addiction. When I got caught at the age of 20 I ran away. I moved to a different state for a "fresh start." That's not what it was. I was running from my problems. Too afraid to face them dead on. Too afraid to look my friends and family in the eyes when they knew how foolish I had been. I was embarrassed. So I moved a few states away. Things were good until a week after I moved to Montana. I turned 21. Little did I know my real problems had just begun. I spiraled out of control. The drinking consumed me. I loved the feeling of being drunk but hated the person I became. A monster. At least that's how it feels looking back. ..Now that I'm sober I want to move back home. I'm tired of running from my problems. I need the support of my family. I need to be close to them. And I'm excited because I have a niece due in April. I want to be there for her. I want to be her role model. Someone she can be proud of and look up to. I know that moving back home is the best way for me to heal from the last three damaging years. I've already applied to college starting december. Enough time to save a little more money and have my ducks in a row. ..I'm so happy. :) I have a plan. I know what the next step is. Thank you Jesus for looking out for me and protecting me when I needed it the most. And to any of you who might be struggling....hang in there. Because things are going to get so much better!

Pretty cool.  Thanks for sharing this!..The thing about running away is you always bring yourself with you.
