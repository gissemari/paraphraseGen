This is the first time I've put 6 months together since 2004. And before that maybe 1994? 1995?..What I've done differently this time around:.* I made an appointment with my doctor for a physical and I decided to be brutally honest about my drinking history. I accepted advice and care from medical professionals and treated my alcohol abuse as a medical problem. (This includes group and individual therapy.).* I attend at least two SMART meetings weekly and am looking at ways to get further involved in SMART. Eventually I want to be a meeting facilitator..* I initiated conversations with friends and family to tell them that I'm trying to quit drinking. This was huge for me. So many times I drank simply because it was easier than telling others that I didn't want to drink or that I thought I had a problem. Some people were a little surprised to hear it but the support and encouragement that I've received as a result of these conversations was a game changer..* I live in a big city where it's easy to find volunteer work. I still volunteer regularly but in the earliest weeks of my sobriety I would sign up for early morning projects - especially Saturday and Sunday mornings - to keep myself accountable...I'll join you all in not drinking for the next 24!
