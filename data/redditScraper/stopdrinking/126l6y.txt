For a few months last year I posted comments on threads but haven't posted in nine months or so. Over this time I've been lurking watching people come and go. I've been looking for some of the people who were struggling to get sober a year ago to come back to the subreddit. Many have disappeared and have never returned...The reality of alcoholism is that many of those who were struggling a year ago and have disappeared are probably drinking today. On the other hand I have seen people stick around this subreddit and stay sober. ..I guess the point of this post it just to remind myself and others that we should be grateful for whatever time we do have sober.  As alcoholics being sober is not our natural state. Every day that we are sober is a successful day regardless of how everything else in life goes. Keep in mind that many who need sobriety never achieve it. Be grateful for the time you have.
