I'm super happy to be sober. I'm sharper at work getting more done around the house my memory is already better I'm not worrying about people at work smelling alcohol on my breath until 10AM and countless other benefits. I have no regrets about discontinuing my alcohol use. ..However as the title suggests goddam are these side effects a bitch. I feel like maybe I should have done in- or out-patient detox as I went stone sober after a year of drinking at least 1/5 a night. I made it through without seizing up or anything but these headaches! And my poor bloated stomach. Also all I want to do is sleep all day (fall asleep at my desk sometimes) but then at night I'm still having crazy terrible nightmares (the standard OMG you just drank a whole bottle while sleepwalking now everyone HATES YOU dreams). ..How much longer can I expect this to go on? I'm not worried about relapsing or anything I've made my choice but I'm anxious to work through these side effects.

I think it is different for everyone tbh. I know it is a tough ride but it's just something you have to get through... all I can say is it gets better. &amp;&amp;&amp; if I am being super honest I pooped right for the first time today (yippee!) but last time I think it took like 3 weeks and that was at in-patient &amp; I was drinking a handle a day for months. Just remember it gets better..High Five 2 weeks!
