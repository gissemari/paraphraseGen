I put on an old playlist and a song that I listened to constantly when my drinking was starting to get worse (So Much Better - Avicii) came on and I had a flash back to when I was in the deepest depths of the bottle and my addiction fueled self hatred. (Side note I'll never judge anyone for mourning a celebrity death again because Avicii's death in April fucked me up and in hindsight was the trigger into doubling down on my addiction and sliding into a really dark place over the following 6 months). ..I have fuzzy drunken recollections of screaming the words to the song and sobbing hating myself so intensely it was painful and yet taking another swig feeling like that was my only solace. "Wish I could do so yeah I can do so see I can do so much better...I can do so much better." Wishing so desperately for things to get better not wanting to acknowledge that it was the beer I so loved so much that was making a hard situation exponentially harder not the 'release' I was pretending it to be...I'm 110% in a better place now and I was not expecting the flash of searing pain that came with the memories. Shocking reminder of how far alcohol dragged me down over the course of several years and how much better my life is now in realistically a short amount of time. The circumstances haven't  changed much but I have. I'm eager to see where this goes if I continue trying to be the best version of me (which absolutely does not include alcohol). I *can* do so much better now that the alcohol demon isn't standing in the way...Thankful for this group where others can understand why being a somewhat normal human adult is such an improvement when on the outside not much has changed. It is an intensely personal struggle and I'm grateful for somewhere to share it without judgement and be met with kindness and understanding...I will not drink with you today :)

&gt; The circumstances haven't changed much but I have. I'm eager to see where this goes if I continue trying to be the best version of me (which absolutely does not include alcohol). I can do so much better now that the alcohol demon isn't standing in the way...Reading this passage is like a breath of fresh air. I can feel your relief and potential in your words. Thank you for sharing...I can relate. The best version of me absolutely does not include alcohol. These days I think that even if I could moderate I wouldn't want to. No point. I don't begrudge others their relationship with alcohol but I just can't see any upside. It's a barrier that masquerades as a portal. 
I had just started coming across Avicii's music then he passed shortly. Was shocking and heartbreaking very real stuff. That line " I took a pill in Ibiza // To show Avicii I was cool // And when I finally got sober felt ten years older  .But fuck it it was something to do" gives me some serious feelings now...Thank you for sharing I am listening to So Much Better now never heard it before. I am so  happy to hear about your successes it does feel amazing to be on this new journey. IWDWYT.
