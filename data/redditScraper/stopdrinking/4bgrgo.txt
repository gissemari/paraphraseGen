Relapsing is taking the easy way. I had two "triggers " cash and wife away for the day. Got two cans early and got another one later. Always thinking I can hide it but the blackout of my memory is catching me.  Feel terrible. Of course. So as I reset my badgewith regret and even fear that wife will kick me out I begin again.

Learning my triggers has been very helpful to me in staying on track.  I learn from mistakes and as others have pointed out it doesn't matter how often we fall what matters is that we keep getting back up.  I will not drink with you today!
You may want to check out the ABC's of SMART Recovery. I use them every time I am triggered. The writing process helps me break down my impulses and the thoughts behind them. Glad you are back with us today. 
I checked on your earlier posts and we are the same age - I'm also 63 working on sober day 30.  What I've learned so far is I have to stop drinking for me me only and to really really want sobriety.  Congratulations on identifying at least two of your triggers I'm still sorting out all of mine.  Your post reminded me to stay vigilant - thank you for helping me today.  I will not drink with you today in celebration of your sober 40 days - may this Day 1 be your last.
It's not that you are "stupid" but rather that alcohol is powerful. Glad you're back.
