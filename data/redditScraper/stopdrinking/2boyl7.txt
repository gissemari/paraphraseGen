Tomorrow is the last day of my beach getaway it's been nice not having any hangovers or regrets in the mornings. I'm going to get up early tomorrow morning and watch the sunrise before we leave. I had 112 days sober before I allowed my Addictive Voice to convince me that I could moderate. That ended with me blacking out after the World Cup final and not remembering the drive home. Fuck that shit. I'm Grateful nothing bad happened but I can't allow that to ever happen again. If you're struggling right now please just don't drink today...it's worth the fight.

I'm not drinking TODAY and it's worth it.  
Congrats I have a 3 week beach holiday coming up and will not be drinking.  Holidays should be about de-stressing and relaxing.  I see so many people using it as an excuse to go on a bender and they come back in a worse state!.
Congratulations!..Once an alky realizes they are in a life-and-death struggle with booze the fight becomes simpler if not easier.  And sometimes it becomes easier as you acquire more positive reinforcement and just plain feel better waking working and playing...@ OP: Keep up the good work.  Glad your relapse didn't cost you anything and that you're smart enough to realize that second chances don't always come along.  We're all pulling for you.
Well done!
Awesome!  That's a big accomplishment! I have a vacation coming up in a couple of weeks and plan to do the same :)  
I'm not drinking today!
