I spent today feeling proud. Not cocky or over confident just proud. The last time I quit drinking 10 years ago I was in a 30 day inpatient rehab center. Looking back that was easy. Even if I wanted to drink no matter how desperate I was there was no alcohol anywhere around. This time on the outside I deal with the struggle of temptation constantly from stores and advertisements and social pressure and I do quite well...granted I definitely have my moments where I'm gritting my teeth and holding on for dear life to not drink but I haven't. It hasn't been an easy month by any definition but I've somehow managed to do it sober and I feel myself becoming a better healthier person and that is truly addictive. :)
