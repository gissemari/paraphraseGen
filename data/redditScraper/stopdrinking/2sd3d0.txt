Good Morning/Afternoon!..*Theme:* Sticking with it!..**"The most difficult thing is the decision to act the rest is merely tenacity. The fears are paper tigers. You can do anything you decide to do. You can act to change and control your life; and the procedure the process is its own reward." - [Amelia Earhart](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/a/ameliaearh120929.html?src=t_tenacity)**..*What I get from it:* Someone said to me at the very beginning of my journey that choosing to quit drinking was simple but not easy.  It took me a little while to understand that [but I get it now](http://thesimplehappylife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tenacity.jpg).  I make a simple decision every day to not drink.  Sticking with that decision through the ups and downs of daily life and all the struggles that come with it and then adding in the new challenges that come with suddenly being sober after years of drinking....well that all falls under the "not easy" category for me for sure.  But I stick with it and I remain tenacious because this process is important and amazing.  It's also about time I put some good honest work into bettering myself.  And the end result I get for staying sober is [beyond worth it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp5JCrSXkJY).  ..Have an awesome day all!

Really like the distinction between simple and easy. Many things that are good for us are quite simple meaning a young child could be taught how to do them but they are not mentally easy. Staying the course when things get boring hard sad frustrating etc. is not fun but it's what I need to do. Reminding myself of this every day because the novelty of sobriety has faded some. Nice quote /u/KetoJam.
Tenacity that's what I need. Excellent quote.
I will not drink TODAY no matter what happens good or bad + dogged persistence = my sober life.
Excellent!  Thanks KetoJam!
