Even if your grandmother doesn't have a German name *Oktoberfest* has become a great American holiday. We get kegs of some of the best *M rzen* beers from the Czech Republic Austria and of course Bavaria Germany...Many of us *puristas* still consider these beers as the simply best even when compared to all of these new school no-holds barred "forget your grandpa's *Reinheitsgebot*" (German Beer Purity law) beers. It doesn't really matter whether you have an opinion though. Personally the only thing that I am really concerned about is maintaining my sobriety...It is honestly a very tough time for me. Combine the best of world class beers with incredible brautwurst roast pork and almost every glorious version of cabbage known to man (I've even seen and eaten kimchee here in crazy mixed up southern California). And Houston I've got a problem!..For me and a large percentage of my family *Oktoberfest* is more than just beer. It's about celebrating the harvest and reaping the fruits of hardwork during the summer. My hardest work this summer has been towards getting and maintaining sobriety. It has been a long overdue gift to myself and my loved ones...Last night completely out of the blue one of my good friends hit me up. Next week there is the beloved German Appreciation night at an elks lodge that over the years we've grown to consider as a sort of preseason game for all of the *Oktoberfest* parties we try to attend. It is almost a sacred holiday for us. I was honestly not prepared for fielding this one especially in light of other issues that have dominated my life the last week...Up until this time I have been fairly successful at anticipating these types of situations and actually spending time meditating and carefully planning out responses to these impulsive *Surprise! let's drink situations.* Not this time. I was totally caught unaware...For a few moments I panicked. What do I want to do? Can I possibly be surrounded by what are honestly my favorite beers and still have any hope of maintaining sobriety? The food the fun all of those delicious *Underbergs* red cabbage sauerkraut and even the far from authentic but totally delicious *elote asado* aka Mexican grilled corn on the cob! ..What do i do? Without time for planning I texted back the honest truth as it trickled through my fat fingers! .."This early in my sobriety there is no way for me to attend German Appreciation night without appreciatiating more *Weihenstephaner Oktoberfest* and *Spaten Oktoberfest* and *Warsteiner Pilsner* than I can afford physically nor financially." (Not exactly but I've had too much coffee!)..Being the somewhat spastic guy I am I also joked about struggling to keep all of that money down (aka not puking!) and making a huge jackass out of myself all in the name of having a good time...As much as I love *Oktoberfest* season ain't no way this guy can fantasize about going even while trying to juggle arm loads of my almost bionic monkey-like nephews. I couldn't resist the siren songsof all that beer which in all honesty are/were/whoReallyCaresAboutTheQualifier my favorites...For me it all boils down to two choices **do I want to drink or do I want to maintain my sobriety?** Do I want to bless the world with my spastic version of the chicken dance or continue my sober journey? I've worked too hard and been through far too much shit to risk throwing away my sobriety for even an evening of tempting fate. ..At this point for this year **I hereby publicly pledge I will not attend any *Oktoberfest* celebrations.** Who knows about the future years. I may eventually become immune to those beers. It doesn't matter. But at least at this point I would be lying to myself that I can attend one of these parties and pretend that I can resist the temptation to drink...**If you want to pledge please do!** The fall season of football and *Oktoberfest* is here. If I want to have any hope of making it through this time sober I need to plan now. Part of this plan is from u/coolcosby's [Baby Steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) where I pledge everyday not to drink. I have benefited so much from this daily commitment that I also need to make a somewhat redundant season wide commitment...If  you want to laugh at my attempt to maintain sobriety have at it. It was just too damn hard to quit this go around for me not to do everything in my power to stay sober. I honestly didn't know if I would be able to. Being honest and using r/stopdrinking has worked for me thus far. And I know that if I gamble with slipping I honestly don't know how long it would take me to return to where I am right now. ..Have a great sober *Oktoberfest* and football season sobernauts. Plan now to make it through this time with your sobriety by any means that makes sense to you. If you do slip get back here as soon as possible. For me this season will be a true trial by fire. I will need to stay as far from the flames as possible if I don't want to get burned!

Awesome job there fellah. You are kicking ass and thinking clearly. Keep it up!..I have not been to an Octoberfest in years myself so no hardship here. I do love the food though. I would recommend finding a great restaurant that serves it and stuffing your face with all the greasy porky cabbagey goodness you want as an alternative.
That's fantastic.  I too have been invited to an Oktoberfest.  I decided to go for a hike in the area and then just say hi to folks instead of committing to the whole day and overnight that I had originally agreed to.  I pledge not to use Oktoberfest as an excuse for falling back into depression anxiety and bad decisions!
I pledge not to drink during this football season and I am prepared to hold myself to that even when people are going to be drinking around me...I will be able to go to a Superbowl party this season and actually remember the 4th quarter!
This has to be a hard choice but that's what it takes sometimes; the  way to succeed is to put sobriety first. ..Thanks for the reminder that the seasonal beer tests are around the corner. I used to like those even after I had migrated to hard liquor after beer became too inconvenient an alcohol delivery system for me and I remember it was kind of rough seeing them in the store the first time.
&gt;And I know that if I gamble with slipping I honestly don't know how long it would take me to return to where I am right now. ..Yeah its too valuable to gamble with. You are doing right! I'll stick with you and not go to any Octoberfest events.
