I went over a month without drinking and decided I was okay to be a "social drinker". I was doing okay I would only have 2 beers when I would go out and never drank alone. ..As time went by 2 drinks would turn into 4 and then I would black out. I am TERRIFIED by how many times I've blacked out these last few months...Please help.

Welcome back I will not drink with you today. 
I've done the whole moderation thing total fail. I also did a 30 day stint looking back I felt great and am trying to remember that feeling. You're here on this sub and that is a great step keep coming back. IWNDWYT
Welcome back. You're in the right place. Blackouts were what caused me to quit finally. Virtually everyone in this forum has thought that they could become a social drinker before realizing that the easier softer way is to just avoid it altogether. We'll be here for you!
I decided that I'm allergic to alcohol. People that are allergic to peanuts don't try to eat peanuts in moderation because it will kill them. So I can't drink in moderation. Or it's going to kill me. Just a new view I took on drinking. 
You'll always have a place here no matter how many times you fuck up as long as you're trying to stay sober today...Welcome back and well done for returning.   IWNDWYT
Thank you for this post. I am currently at Day 35 and am starting to feel like I can be a social drinker but I am terrified of going back into my ways of binge drinking and blacking out. Thank you for posting this and reminding me that that is what will happen. 
I felt/feel exactly this way. I think it comes down to finally accepting that you can't moderate. You have to stop altogether and never look back. It's so hard to accept but when you're to that point of blacking out all the time you already know the truth.
