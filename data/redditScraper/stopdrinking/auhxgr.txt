I feel like a failure. I don't drink much so my relapses are when I go to the store and buy 2 tall cans of IPA and down them while watching youtube videos and hating myself for being such a stupid failure. ..How do you stop the relapses? I'll get a craving and I'll go to the gym write stuff down whatever it is and its still there so sometimes I cave and sometimes I don't...I need help.

I made a vow that I would post here before I drink again again.  That slows me down before I make an impulsive decision and I get help.  That's saved me a few times...Good luck to you! You can do this. IWNDWYT 
I don't know how people feel about kratom here but it has helped me so much that I don't even think about a drink. 
It took me a long time to get going and start getting some serious lengths of sobriety. AA helped me. It gave me a place to go and waste some time. After my last relapse which was 4 months ago I woke up and decided I would go to AA any time that I wasn't working working out and/or taking care of immediate needs. That was typically 2 meetings a day for a couple of months.  ..It's just what helped me - I know there's seemingly a lot to unpack w AA/God/etc but at the end of the day it was just a place I could go to hang out with other people who were sober or trying to get sober. That's it. ..Finding a new outlet one focused on recovery has made all the difference. You got this!..&amp;#x200B;
