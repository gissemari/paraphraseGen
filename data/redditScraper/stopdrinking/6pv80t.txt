The ability of the addictive mind to bend time and space ...Past. The past is eradicated. The years spent miserable and struggling are no longer real. They are gone and never happened. The only fleeting memory is the good times with back slapping and fun. Hang overs and empty wallets are without a ghost...Present. This is the only thing that's happening and it's without an end. ..Future. The future is a continuation of the current feeling and will never change. Unless you crack in which case all possibility is before you and can quit tomorrow because you will be stronger and the feeling won't be as bad...In reality it's all bullshit. However bad you feel It will pass. It always does...You have forgotten an incalculable amount of hard times that were terrible at the time. Just wait...

Time warp or time shrinking is the way I feel about being drunk...I stop worrying about the past and especially about the future. Only the present good feeling exists and seems to continue - until the buzz starts coming down and you need to drink increasingly more...It twists time and reality into unhealthy contortions.
I completely get what your saying . Being drunk is a time warp . Nothing worth anything gets acomplished . You sober up standing in the same spot you left yourself before you drowned in alcohol . Or laying .. In a pit of shit to top it off ! Let's not ... Forward friends  let's move ahead !!!!
If you want a badge the link is in the sidebar.  Time and space does bend.  I'm staying focused on the now and stacking days.  The momentum builds.  Alcohol doesn't make anything better.  Diligently facing issues leads to feeling really good.  I won't drink with you today.
