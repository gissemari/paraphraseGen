Since last year alcohol has ruled my life I've been in and out of hospitals detox centres rehabs and dry houses and at times I can say I'm doing awesome! I'm in AA which despite my strong atheism I am finding it very helpful and a joy to be involved in! I have a sponsor a copy of the big book and I try to read daily reflections everyday. Thing is I'm still struggling to get a grip on how my life turned out. I can easily sneak a night of vodka in and get away with it I can easily wait a month or so until I do it again I actually like being sober but every now and then I need a drink but I know from all the AA reading I've done that this is bad! Is it wrong to just not believe all this AA bollocks might not be the answer?

AA doesn't resonate with me. I try to do what is right for me which unfortunately for my inner booze-hound means not drinking at least for now. I hope to one day be able to drink in moderation but I tend to binge drink any time I drink. If I had been in hospitals detox centers rehab or dry houses I would not drink personally. AA works for many but what works is different for everyone.
It's always your choice!  You get to choose every day what you want and what you're willing to accept...I respect anyone who decides takes action and accepts the consequences...For me I decided to eliminate alcohol-associated consequences from my life.
If you are able to have a drink once a month or so with no problem what are you doing here? 
Why isn't there an AA that i can identify with??!
???
I'm not quite sure what your question is here.....A lot of people stop drinking without the help of AA you don't have to go (unless court ordered)...No one can make you not drink that's up to you.
