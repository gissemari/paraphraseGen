Well I had some days lined up and then boop... There they went. I finally worked up enough strength to request a new badge and start my ticker over at one...I'm bummed but hey it is what it is. I got the longest chunk of time I've had in a loooooong time and learned some super valuable stuff... I'm trying not to let it get me down. I'm trying to look at this as a learning opportunity...Here's what I learned... My relapse started days before I drank. I stopped popping into SD lost interest in meetings and just generally had this "Meh" disposition and was completely unmotivated. And I knew what was happening. But insteas of talking to my sponsor or going into the SD chat or posting on here I sat with it. I let it stew. And then I drank. ..It's weird because I just found out the other day that I got the job I've been so excited about. Last night my lush of a brain figured "hey look how hard you've been working... You got the job you've lost a significant amount of weight you've been working your tail off in your recovery... you deserve a night to celebrate! And you know how you should celebrate? Drink alcohol!" (totally doesn't make sense as I type it out. Funny how that works... )..And you know the worst/best thing about it? It wasn't even fun. I immediately didn't like the effect it had on my personality and the lack of clarity... But I still over imbibed. I was hot. Smoked too many cigarettes. Didn't eat a good dinner. Slept like shit. Woke up feeling like kaka. Ate like crap today because of the nausea. Bleh. ..So here we go SD... Its day 1 again. I'm glad you're here. I'm glad I'm here. And I'll tip my off brand Aldi version of La Croix to you. ..IWNDWYT    ....
