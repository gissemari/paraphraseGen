Well I'm going to go ahead and apologize because this is going to be a rant... It's amazing how quickly my brain can just completely change thought processes. I've noticed I'm a month sober (yay) and I've never even gotten close to this long. I haven't craved alcohol. Every time I see it glorified on tv or hear people fondly talking about it I'm quit to scoff but have haven't been tempted in a few weeks. I just plain don't want to drink. I don't have any concrete "plans" and I don't attend AA or have any outside support (except this sub) and I have been okay with that this whole time. I don't do it one day at a time I have decided I DON'T WANT ANOTHER DRINK EVER. Now I realize that all of these things aren't necessarily good. I've noticed the most successful sober folks in this sub say to do it one day at a time attend meetings and have a sobriety plan... But in my typical close-minded arrogant fashion I figured I didn't need any of these things just the desire to stop drinking...I'm learning that I'm a jealous person. I know DAMN well not to compare my situation to others but on this sub (the place I come to hear from people in absolute sobriety) I've seen several people who continue to use other substances... Be it pot and hallucinogens or benzos and Xanax... And I'm fine with people doing whatever they want but I had a history with those things before I ever took my first drink and I know first hand the dangers. I'm talking specifically about the Xanax and such. I understand that these things can help with alcohol withdrawals but I watched someone I loved very much completely deteriorate from Xanax and realized I was going down a similar path. I could function as an alcoholic but as a pill popper I'd wake up and couldn't find the bathroom or would put my shoes on the wrong foot...I'll get to the point before this post explodes my computer.. I had to take care of some "unpleasant" business today that left me feeling kinda "meh." We all know the feeling. It's often these moments where sobriety once again becomes a struggle but drinking was far from my mind. I was heading home and there happens to be a "hood" on the way and I see some guys. Now I've come to terms with the fact that I look like a drug user. We've all seen those people and as much as I hate it I'm one of them. These guys obviously saw it in me and started motioning me over and making hand gestures. They were literally standing out on the corner and I knew what they were doing. I was flooded with the most intense bizarre craving I've had in my 31 days of not drinking. I wanted so badly to slow down crack the window and ask if they had any bars... But I didn't. I kept driving but the feeling didn't go away. My brain went straight into rationalizing mode. I even told myself "the stopdrinking sub says xanax is okay" even though I know the only time ANYONE even slightly says that is when someone gets prescribed them because of DANGEROUS physical withdrawals which I am obviously beyond now...This was crazy long and I don't care if anyone reads it... As usual just typing this crazy shit out has me feeling better. Needless to say I understand the need for a plan now because this craving was STRONG and it came out of nowhere. I haven't touched a pill of that sort in several years...Anyway I'm still trucking along. Have a good one fellow sober kids.

Can I just say that the alcoholic in me read this..&gt; and ask if they had any bars..completely differently than your intent? ;-)..As a part of your support here on SD I just want to tell you congrats on getting past that. I've never had a craving since I quit drinking and I still am waiting for the other shoe to drop and I finally get one like you experienced. Scary shit but you got through it. ..&gt; Now I realize that all of these things aren't necessarily good.....So what are you going to do with that knowledge?
