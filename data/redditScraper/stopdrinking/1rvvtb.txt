I went to IOP rehab in September but dropped out about halfway through due to my social anxiety..I've had a couple of binges where I drink for 3 days and can't remember any of it. The last was this weekend and I don't remember anything from Wednesday night through Saturday. ..I knew what I was doing on Wed. I played the tape forward and knew what I was getting myself into but I drank anyway. ..I just needed to get that out there

Don't give up. It is hard as hell to be patient but YOU WILL GET STRONGER! I never thought that I would make two weeks but I did. You can do this please don't give up...
I went to AA after a DUI six years ago. It didn't work. It might help you  try it. This Subreddit has saved me. I can't express how awesome everyone is here. Use the Chat Post things or just P.M. Me. I will always get back to you as soon as I can. We are all in this together.
Don't quit quitting!  Every day you don't drink is a victory!
You sound very much like a person for whom drinking is disastrous. What ever it takes for you to get sober...get there. Detox rehab AA SMART counseling anything and everything. We'll be here for you too.
As many have said find a support group. If it's AA and you don't like the religion part get out of it what you can and leave the rest behind. It's more about being around others that understand your struggle.
