For me first month of not drinking sucked the seventh month sucked and right now is kind of sucking. ..But I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt that each moment of struggle has paid off in more ways than I can count. Quitting drinking was the best decision I've ever made...If you're struggling reach out for help. Hit an AA or SMART meeting. Treat yo'self to some delicious food. Whatever you've gotta do to stay straight...It sucks being at the bottom--trust me I know. The good news is you don't have to stay there.
