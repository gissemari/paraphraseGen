I've said it many times to individuals here but to all of you especially the mods for making SD work so well thank you so much. I honestly could not have made it without coming here every evening instead of drinking. By reading the stories advice and all the reasons for relapse and success this has been my foundation of support (as well as a good slap upside my head when I needed it).  Thanks again I'll "see" you all tomorrow night! :)

I just went and got my 30 day AA chip today. Getting a room full of relative strangers that all share your problem give you a round of solid applause made a big impact on me. Congrats and keep it up.
