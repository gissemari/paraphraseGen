I've essentially suffered numerous traumas and have used alcohol as a coping mechanism. I am completely disgusted with myself at the moment. I hate the person that I become when I'm drunk. I hate blacking out and having my friends look after me because I am too fucked. I have tried quitting so many times.. it's depressing. I just really need solid advice to cut this disgusting dependency out my life. I have struggled for 4 years.. and I just want it to be over. I don't want to use alcohol as a coping mechanism anymore.. and I just want real and honest advice how to quit. Talking therapy does nothing for me... and I don't think AA will help in this instance. I also don't think moderation would help either.. yet it's incredibly hard to abstain... hence why I've failed. I just really want to quit for good but I'm really struggling. Any advice would be greatly appreciated at this point.
