Around 5 AM I jolted awake. I can't even explain really what I initially felt but as that initial feeling faded I just felt awful. It was like I had been electrocuted. My body felt heavy and weak. I felt dissociated and depersonalized as shit. I have a lot of mental issues those feelings are no stranger to me but god damn I don't think I have ever felt more depersonalized in my life.  ..I was so weak and so spaced out that I struggled to move. I lifted my arm up and down and it felt like slow motion and it felt so heavy. Then the feelings of dread came I thought I was dying. I thought about running downstairs and grabbing a drink but didn't. Eventually I fell back asleep and that is when the bad dreams started. ..First I dreamt that I had a drink. It sucked because it felt so real I was so mad that I messed up. I was relieved when I woke up and realized it was a dream....Second I dreamt that I had started doing drugs. In the dream bleach was a drug and I was doing it in my moms rental car. The car reeked of bleach after and that is how my mom found out what I was doing. She was mad at me for making the rental car smell like bleach and upset about my habit. I felt like shit. I woke up feeling like shit. As bizarre as some parts of the dream were it really hit me in some of my fears. ..

I am on day 4 as well! All I can say is that we have put our brains through a lot of stuff by drinking and it is doing what it needs to adjust crazy dreams and all. Be gentle on yourself and know that your mind and body are trying to find a new normal and get rid of the booze. Hang in there friend!
Great job on 4 days!..I think you'll find [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index#wiki_does_anyone_else_have_dreams_about_drinking.3F) interesting...
