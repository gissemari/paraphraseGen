I read from others experience about struggling to sleep in the early days. I did have this problem for about 4 days but now iv went the complete opposite.  Iv been sleeping for 14 hours at a time then still really tired... I feel like I could slee poo all day. This normal?

Lengthy sleeping is the body and brain recovering.  Good stuff!  Let it happen your sleep patterns will sort themselves out in my experience.
Get the sleep.  It's what your body needs.
First couple of months I could sleep 12 hours a day easy.   That was my experience and it almost caused me to relapse.   The overwhelming fatigue was terrible. ..It finally has got better for me.
I am envious of you!! I sleep max 6-8 hours and Im still tired...If the body asks for 14 hours and you have the time to do it just do it!! ..I don't think it will last forever. 
Thank you for posting this; I'm feeling the same way. I'm on Day 8 (right behind you)...I'm in bed by 9p at the latest and am up at 4:45a to work out which is almost a full 9hrs. By the time lunch time hits I'm nodding off; it's too bad work naps are frowned upon here in the U.S. ;P
