A friend of mine has constantly been getting into trouble - bar fights drunk driving and the likes. Last night was the last straw for him. Now he is seeking for my advice; however I'm not good at giving advice. I can share my experience and struggle with alcoholism but I'm afraid that that won't be enough...What are some key points to share about this process of sobriety?..tldr; My friend keeps fucking up while intoxicated and is now looking for guidance. I am 281 days sober but I'm not good w words. What should I say?

I would ask more questions than I gave out advice.  What is it they want in quitting?  Do they know the different methods for quitting?  If not maybe go through them and see if any are a fit.  And of course you know what worked for you.  I might also talk about the pitfalls of the early days.  How many posts here are in the "is this normal" line?  My first try lasted two days because I had no idea what I was doing or that my addict brain would talk me out of it.
