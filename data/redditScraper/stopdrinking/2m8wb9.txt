The short video is **[Here](http://news.yahoo.com/video/russell-brand-39-quot-note-141434397-cbs.html)**.  It is part of a CBS series titled "Note to Self" where prominent people are asked to write a note to their younger self and read it on camera. Russel's was quite poignant and touching to me.  I loved the section about getting "thrown into the rocks and boulders" in the turbulent sea  of addiction.  I still hate his humor but this was good.  I hope you enjoy it or relate to it as much as I did.    Jozee

Thanks I really enjoyed that. 
I never really gave him any attention before.  I thought he was a douche.  But since I got sober and found out he's sober he became more interesting to me.  I've seen a few interviews where he talks about his sobriety and he actually seems like a good dude...Either way (good dude or douche) I hope his message helps someone.
I have an affinity for all fellow recovering addicts. I enjoyed the video. Thanks for sharing
Thanks Jozee! I don't know much about his movies or whatever else he's famous for but I do appreciate his eloquence and wisdom in regards to recovery.
He does a great job of talking about the one thing that remains elusive to me liking yourself...Come on You Irons!!!!
He has a good documentary about advocating abstinence based recovery too. There was a link to it somewhere around here. 
He does seem a bit in love with himself but the things about drugs and recovery I've read by him were amazing.
He's a smart guy sometimes the presentation is a bit off and I hated the things that made him famous originally (Big Brother etc) but I'm liking what I hear these days.
I'd recommend the Marc Maron interview. Russell is actually a fascinating and very insightful guy.  
I like what he said about listening to that voice inside. Whether that voice is love connectivity or God (or in my mind intuition?) take care of it and it will take care of you.
