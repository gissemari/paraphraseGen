[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy Hump Day! What's Up Wednesdays are when we celebrate our sobriety see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** I knew that I had to do two things today: go to see my liver doctor and write  What's Up Wednesday.  I didn't know what the doctor was going to say and I thought  Well if it's bad news at least I can say for my  Triumph' that I put on my big-girl panties and went to face the music. ..Well she didn't give me bad news. In fact what she said was  I looked at your liver scan and your scarring isn't as bad as I previously thought it was. In fact **it may be that you don't have cirrhosis after all. ** Then she added  Your liver is happy. ..You guys! When I walked out of the doctor's office my first thought was how I couldn't wait to tell you -- my SD family. As I am writing this I am having some Sparkling ICE. Please raise a glass with me to say cheers to good health for all of us...**Struggle:** Honestly after what my doctor said I really don't have any.. .**General:** Do you know about the [maguffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin) (also spelled MacGuffin)? It's a term coined by Alfred Hitchcock to describe an object (like a locked suitcase) that gets characters to go from A to B but in the end is not actually all that important. I'll say to my brother  Let's get some Japanese writing paper; it's a maguffin.  Meaning -- let's take a fun trip to Japantown and have a nice lunch of *udon* noodles. While we're there we'll also go to the stationery store and get some paper. But the errand is really just an excuse to go have some fun.

HAPPY HUMP DAY!   I won't drink with all you beautiful souls today!  
Wonderful news for you!! Congratulations..Also thanks for the new word.. maguffin. I didn't know how much I needed that word! I do that sort of thing all the time. 
Happy Wednesday I hope you all have a lovely day. I won't drink with you today    
Oh wow good news i'm so happy for you! ..I'm happy to be back on track. I did not relapse but after the first sober month I noticed how the thoughts about alcohol and with it the negative memories generally drift into the background of my mind. Which is not bad in itself but at the same time the thought came up that I could start drinking again at some point. Wtf! I'm not going to do anything...I was at three weddings during the month had fun without alcohol and felt good (saturday is the next and last one this year  ). Then when a few days ago a friend asked me if I could drink alcohol again I was not averse to the idea at first. That shook me up again and I immediately started to be more active in this sub again read more and contribute something...It's crazy how your addicted brain tries to make you drink again. So here I am and I feel good to share this with you. Take care of yourselves. ..I will not drink with you today   .....
Congrats!! 
Triumph. I was called into work three days this week in my favourite department. I always feel uplifted working with the 0-2 year olds. ..Struggle. This unemployment thing is taking a toll on me much faster than I expected. Recently had to do a badge reset because of a complete meltdown. ..General. The cashier at my local store made a comment about my weight loss. I know she meant well but comments like that from people I don't know all that well make me wildly uncomfortable. Can anyone relate or am I just ungrateful?
Congratulations! That's a massive relief and a timely reminder to us all as to one of the really scary ramifications of our old hobby...My Triumph - simply - 5 days dry one of the few times over the last 20 years. But this time it's because I want to as opposed to just feeling I ought to. I've finally admitted to myself that I'm NOT in control and won't ever be so why continue the struggle? It's like the shackles have come off and I can be myself without having to work around and hide this problem. Also - finding you guys...Struggle - is this a honeymoon period? I'm high on life. My wife is beginning to trust me again and see a rosy future but I know any crash would be catastrophic. It's easy to say I won't drink 5 days in but what about Christmas that hot day after a hike when I end up in a pub with friends......General - an observation. It's putting the bins out day and for the first time a) I won't hurt my back putting out the bottles and b) I won't feel the need to hide them under a mountain of cardboard and plastic...
 That's great news about the scan! Congratulations!  .Triumph: I finally got around to looking at my finances and planning them properly. It's the first time I've done this without having the feeling that it was all pointless because I'd just spend it on booze. It feels like I'm actually in control of my cashflow now.   .Struggle: I went through a couple of days of really bad eating (snacking on things constantly) and not getting out the house much (I work from home so it's easy to lirerally not go outside all day if I'm busy). I've worked it out now but I felt pretty bad  .General: I initiated a random phone conversation with a colleague yesterday complimenting some work they were doing. They seemed genuinely surprised and went on to say how they felt they were struggling with things and aren't considered to be very good at work. I explained that wasn't how they came across at all how they make their work look effortless and how well regarded they are (all true). I realised afterwards that I'd had a similar conversation a few weeks ago with someone else  but I was the person lacking that confidence. It's really important to remember that the way people perceive themselves can be massively different from how they come across to others and a few words of support and encouragement can go a long way
That is one huge triumph. What fabulous music to face!..Triumph: I wish I could report better for this but really it's just getting this far. I did not think I could do it. I thought everyone in the double-and-beyond digits here was a unicorn. The last time I went a month without alcohol Bill Clinton was president...Struggle: All the things I didn't deal with while I was drinking are still here. The last two days have sucked as this awareness has begun to sink in. I am leaning a lot on the first-weekers here even if it's not their first first week and trying to practice gratitude. My life by no means sucks; it's just a bit of a bummer to realize how much time I wasted trying to make it suck...General: I love fall. It's tinged with some sadness now but still hands down my favorite time of year.
Whoa congrats on the good medical results! "Your liver is happy" kinda makes me cry....Worried about my own liver. Only 24 years old. Not so hot about being on the wagon at the moment.
Congrats on your great health news!..Triumph: I haven't checked in here very much the last few weeks (month?) as I've been incredibly busy with work we are short several members in the leadership so I've stepped up and made a big impression - could not have done this if I was drinking. I've also had a few moments to start reflecting on why I've escaped into the bottle over the past 20 years - a lot of work to be done on myself but it's a big success that I'm trying to identify my emotions and feelings rather than run from them. ..Struggle: One of the reasons I stopped drinking in August was my health and I still have a lot of work ahead of me on this front. I need to eat better I need to exercise I need to get more sleep. And considering that my decades of drinking have contributed to me having osteoporosis at 49 exercise really is a "have to do" and not just a "want to do"..IWNDWYT
I have just joined n finally admitted to myself I'm an alcoholic hope I can talk to some people
CONGRATS!!!! That is very good liver news!!! I also like the maguffin reference - gonna try to keep that one in my head! Have a great day!!
**Triumph:**  Back up to 13 days making a run at my previous record 16 days.   I could call this my first 30-day sober period in 4 years if I don't count the one slip.   But I feel pretty solid now so the days will accumulate one at a a time...**Struggle:**  Chronic back pain is my #1 struggle.   But I started doing exercises from YouTube and I'm going to see an MD today to get a treatment plan...**General:**   Nothing general to say.   Everything is very specific.
Oh my gosh that's awesome news about your liver! So great thank you for sharing it with us! :)..For me hmm....Triumph: my work as a commission artist as well as my comic patreon are going great. In the good and bad interactions (surprisingly many tbh) i'm learning so much about how to run a business. I haven't craved a drink in a few days and have been eating healthy...Struggle: I retraced my commute to where i studied on the days when my alcoholism was at its worst. I'd always buy so many bottles of beer it was hard to carry them back to the train. I walked by all the places i brought my beer at and felt such a great shame and sadness wash over me. I do need to face these feelings though. it's the only way to get over them...General: I'm getting way into scented candles/floral essences/incense lately. I quit smoking at the start of the year and now that i'm taking steps to quit drinking too i can actually enjoy nice scents. I work from home so i like to be surrounded by nice scents. My favorite rn is a "cashmere figs and iris" essential oil mix. It smells like spring.
That is wonderful news Sfgirlmary! I know that must be a huge relief for you...Triumph: Up early to enjoy another beautiful sober morning...Struggle: Not letting coworker's shortcomings get under my skin. Not holding a grudge which only hurts me in the end. Not worrying about the speck in someone else's eye before I remove the log in my own. Keeping my own side of the street clean...General: Try to remember to do the next right thing..
So happy to hear your good news!!! Here's hoping you feel great all day (raises coffee). ..Thanks for leading my favorite weekly thread. ..Triumph: This is small but mighty - handling daily and weekly routines more consistently. Working out more often self-care. At home putting away laundry putting away dishes. At work showing up for weekly meetings more consistently getting routine bookkeeping tasks done. Makes the weeks feel more productive and less chaotic. I used to say I was "bad at routine" but maybe establishment of routines was just continually interrupted by crappy days and moods brought on my too much drinking. ..Struggle: Not always motivated at night to do something that has value. Could've done so many things last night: yoga guitar serious reading even pleasure reading ... but instead mostly skimmed the internet and Facebook. Trying not to be hard on myself because I did have a very busy day but I'd like to find the energy to do something more worthwhile in the evenings. ..General: Tried white noise last night and slept better than usual. Hoping it's not a fluke! ..
Triumph: I'm getting a promotion/new position at the end of the year in our newest facility!!!  ..Struggles:. I'm going to have to move quite a way to a new city and find a new rent house which is stressful. Also new place will have a large taproom that I will be in charge of. I've never had to work around alcohol before just food so I'm a little worried. Hopefully the kitchen will be so busy I won't have time to worry about the beer!!!
Great news!..Recently I've been struggling with the though of the impending weekend. It's my mum's birthday and I haven't told my parents I'm not drinking anymore. So when we go see them I will have the strong temptation to just go along with it and drink like normal. I'm not sure the best way to deal with it really drinking is a big part of my families life and I feel like they will think I'm a failure if I can't man up and drink. At the moment I'm trying to work out an excuse as to why I won't drink. Anyway I will definitely not drink with you today! 
MARY!! OMG what grrrrrrrreat news!! I'm so happy!! "Your Life is Worth Much More Than Gold..." let's celebrate with a lil 'jam' (I know how much you like him): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QdwYY9rZL4. xoxo &lt;3..**Triumph:**  Kept calm and handled a very difficult situation without even a *thought* of picking up...**Struggle:**  The situation? My 7 year old nephew told me some very disturbing things that my sister said about me to my Mom that he overheard...and repeated to me *verbatim*. I had a '1:1 AA meeting' with K and he helped me to understand the situation rationally. Now I need to get my ass to a meeting IRL then sit *her ass* down and have a long talk...**General:**  I've begun to venture out in Upstate NY now that I'm living there with K part time. I was fearful in the beginning not knowing where the F I was or where the F I was going but his Mom has been my 'tour guide' lol and we've been having a blast.  I love exploring and I love the more peaceful vibe up there. Starting to wonder if it's a possible lifelong destination... ;)
Awesome news SFG! I very happily raise my coffee with you cheers to good health!..Triumph: Rallying myself to face another stressful busy day. I have a renewed sense of optimism that today will be a good day and even if things don't go well I can only do what I can do...Struggle: I have too much work coming in from different people and everybody thinks their thing should be my priority. I became overwhelmed by it yesterday and had a terrible sense of feeling defeated. In that moment of feeling so awful I had a serious thought that I needed to drink. I didn't. But it scares me that had I not been at work at the time it very well could have happened...General: I've never heard of the maguffin I like it :) My brother and I do something kind of similar on Sundays we go out and run errands and have soft pretzel snacks at Target and catch up with each other along the way. We call it gallivanting really it's just an excuse to hang out together. 
Struggle: with head and mind sort of clearing up im starting to become closer to my real self god i hate that guy and people around me have started noticing. More timid kept to myself hateful snappy.   Gonna pick up some book someone here tipped about. Have a good day everyone! 
Keeping busy today! IWNDWYT
I won't drink with you today!
Cheers to your good healthy! That's wonderful!!..**Triumph**: Yesterday someone who drinks the most out of all my friends who I used to drink with a lot told me "You inspired me to teetotal for two weeks."   This put me over the moon!..**Struggle**: This might be an overshare but my birth control puts me into a deep hormonal pre-menstrual depression for a day and a half every month and it happened yesterday. This is like an intense can't-even-watch-TV heavy existential malaise where I'm questioning every aspect of my life crying over nothing in a random restaurant feeling in every way like a lump. I was  hoping it would be less intense now that I'm not drinking but the sheer difference between that state and my normal new happier state actually makes it seem so much worse. ..**General:** I'm hoping to start getting back to the gym soon! Working out really helped keep my mind off drinking when I quit this summer and I really want to get back into it!
**Triumph:** I've been cooking so much lately. Lots of great food makes me feel amazing. I've been getting pretty good at making my own coffee in the mornings too which is saving me a ton of money. Alcohol hasn't even been much of a temptation for me lately which is pretty great...**Struggle:** The past week or so things have been a little fuzzy around the edges. I went off my meds a couple months ago just because I was too lazy to refill my prescription and I felt amazing at the time but lately little things have been throwing me through a loop that wouldn't have when I was on a low dose of Prozac. I picked up the remainder of my prescription yesterday and started taking it this morning...The fact that I have to take these meds make me feel like something's inherently broken with me. I guess my brain chemistry is just a little off and I have to learn to live with that.  ..**General:** I start coaching an after-school climbing program today. I'm nervous but excited. I miss working with kids and I'm sure I'll learn a thing or two about climbing!
Mary that's awesome news!! I'm so happy for you. And I love new words so maguffin is awesome!..**Triumph:** Personally I took a four day retreat to the woods (mostly) for my birthday and successfully surprised my son's gf at her college soccer game. Professionally I'm getting a lot of kudos for a training program I created for my new reports and some of it may become on-boarding training for all new employees...**Struggle:** I had a tough counseling session with my spouse last night.  It's getting clearer that our sabbatical will likely become permanent.  Having some feels about that...**General:** I love living alone! I love having my own rhythm and silence and routine.  Like this morning with the stove on because it's cool out pup beside me coffee in hand and my dear friends at SD to wake up with.Now it's time for meditation...Blessings on your day all.
My current triumph is getting through one day. I know it's not much but I started and I feel good about that...Struggle: I had a lot of trouble sleeping last night. I was kind of hungover yesterday so that might have had something to do with it.  Anybody else have trouble sleeping the first couple of days dry?
Travel long for work has proved a nice four month test. Made it down one day even with a hotel gift of wine and chocolates- I ate the chocolate wine is still sitting there. Not drinking today- or the three more days until I'm home. 
This seems fun!..Triumph: 10 DAYS! I'm so excited that I made it to ten days! I've been trying to recommit to not drinking after having about a month under my belt and could not get past 4-5 days do this is pretty exciting for me. ..Struggle: Pretty much my depression and negative self thoughts have been very prominent the last 3 days. The depression seems to be all day but the negative self thoughts really pop up in the late afternoon (usually the same time I decide to drink in the night) so I'm just fighting past those the best I can and not feeding into it with drinking every night. ..General: I have to get a breast ultrasound for some lumps they found a few months ago that haven't gone away. I'm in my 20s so a lower chance of breast cancer... And I'm just not really knowing how to feel about it. Sometimes I'm worried and sometimes I'm not. I just wish I didn't have to wait 3 weeks for the appointment! 
Triumph:  I went for a physical for the first time since 1999. Shockingly everything is fine but awaiting the blood results. ..Struggle: Despite no longer pounding 20 light beers per day I have gained weight since I stopped. I've dropped a bit since July but the last two weeks have gone back UP despite trying to calorie count and walking 10-12 miles per week. I try to eat healthy and avoid indulging in sweets and stuff but I just have a big appetite (when sober). I had Blue Apron for awhile and could eat the entire meal for two and still not be full. ..Gen: my favorite macguffin is the briefcase in Pulp Fiction. I remember people analyzing the shit out of that trying to figure out what was in there. I love the idea of using them as an excuse to go places. I guess I have been doing that a lot lately!  I've made it part of my daily routine to get out in the middle of the day and run some kind of errand even if it doesn't need to be done. 
That's great news! I am so happy for you. :)..**Triumph:** I am biting the bullet and getting steroid shots for my knee. I hope it helps...**Struggle:** I am probably spending $100ish/week on binging and purging. Shit's more expensive than my drinking was. I am really close to a dry weight of 89 lbs and am struggling with wanting to be there before our big trip in late October because I'll be eating more for that and the lower my weight the more wiggle room I have to eat/gain weight...
**Triumph:** I got through a 5-day visit with my "wicked" stepmother. She's not as wicked now that I have better emotional coping skills but she's still hard to be around. ..**Struggle:** Patterns of behavior are *deeply* rooted. It's not surprising--I've had 20 years to develop the patterns of interaction. It is interesting to be aware of them and see that other people are unaware of theirs...**General:** I try to combine fun and errands whenever possible. Makes the errand less onerous.
*Triumph*: I got up early and meditated today went to therapy have a meeting soon and plan to hit the gym for a bit later. Maybe I'll get some writing done too :)..*Struggle*: I had a setback this weekend and am resetting my badge. Back to 1! But it's kicking me back into gear I started getting lazy about keeping my drinking in check...*General*: I just went to therapy and I can hear myself being in denial about my problem. I have an event mid-October and an event in mid-December that I'm already panicking about not being able to drink at; part of me knows I can get through them without drinking but a much louder part of me doesn't WANT to get through them without drinking.
Triumph: A lot lately honestly. A big one is that my financial aid change was processed and I received a grant that will pay my rent and groceries for two semesters. I would have never been able to go through all the paperwork and hoops required to get this done if I was drunk. I am so thankful as working during nursing school is way too much right now. ..Struggle: Just trying to stay ahead of everything right now. Everyday is a new project test exam quiz paper. I really think they wanna weed us out even though they claim they want us all to pass lol..General: Did you know those red spots you randomly started to get on you as an adult are called cherry angiomas? They are harmless and nothing to worry about. Wow thanks nursing school 
**Triumph:** I haven't had a drink in a few days and I'm proud because I've been so stressed out and I really wanted to. Also I found you guys and the chat is lovely...**Struggle:** I live with my boyfriend who is also an alcoholic and he is having a very hard time which puts a huge amount of stress on me seeing him that way. I do what I can to help and support him but my patience is only so strong and we've both been in this cycle for a while him more so than me. The lack of control of the situation is so distressing...**General:** On a positive note! I am putting together a costume for the Renaissance Festival this weekend and I couldn't be more excited. I've finally managed to schedule to be there on pirate weekend. I can't wait.
Triumph: Busted my ass at the gym last night and rather enjoyed it. My brain is all "But you haaaaaate exercising" and my body is all "More of that please." It's very weird. ..Struggle: Money. Money is a constant struggle for me. I really want to continue at the Y but I won't be able to afford it once this free program ends. I have cut back everything I can cut back but I still can't come up with the $35 a month it will cost me...General: I have the WORST fruit fly problem I've ever had. I've got about 6 vinegar traps in my kitchen and the little fuckers keep multiplying. It's driving me nuts. I've poured boiling water/bleach/lemons/vinegar/baking soda down the drains I don't keep any fruit on the counter I do the dishes nightly but they still are there and I can't stand them. 
Oh I do love What's Up Wednesday!..**Triumph:** I got through a particularly busy and stressful period at work and think that I managed my stress appropriately. ..**Struggle:** Someone close to me is going through a very difficult time and I feel helpless because I can't do anything to improve their situation except try to lend an ear and offer words of encouragement...**General:** I've been really focusing on consistency and routine these past few weeks. I've been getting up at 5:30 am during the week. I've started using a Panda Planner to help me stay focused on my daily goals. I've been trying to meditate daily with Headspace even if it's only the 3 minute "daily headspace" meditation. My hope is to keep up with all of these things until they become a natural habit.
Triumph:  Got a new position about a month ago just found out yesterday they moved me from salary back to hourly and I got like 70 cent raise. ..Struggle:  I'm really having a problem finding my shine.  I'm happy for the moment but the lows I've been having lately are really really bad.  I don't have much that brings me joy ATM but I'm just happy that I'm happy. ..General: My old boss wanted to hang out so over the course of a month we planned an a sort of double date to the local renaissance fest.  Dude was an hour or so late and brought two friends and a kid.  I had no idea who his friend are or anything like that so it was just hella awkward.  I used to be able to just drink my way through these situations.  
I will not drink with you today 
Wow that is AWESOME about your liver results!!  Congratulations!! And I love that you first response was to share it all with us.  I'll raise a tea toast to you Ms. Mary!..**Triumph:** I am learning albeit slowly how to not go to the panicky place when my world loses its stability.  I still have the reaction but I'm having more faith that I will regain emotional equilibrium and perspective in short order so I don't feel the need to act on the initial emotion.  It is an area in my life that I felt really got stunted from drinking.  It's a subtle change but it feels real...**Struggle:**  I worry about a good friend who is still using drinking to cope has experienced great loss recently and is staying in a very unhealthy relationship because she can't stand to lose any more at the moment.  It hurts my heart.  I had her over to dinner last night and just let her talk it all out and talked about my experience reading This Naked Mind and beginning Refuge Recovery.  Tried not to lecture just mainly listen.  I so want her to be happy!..**General:**  I love the cool trivia you always have!  I love words and maguffin is fabulous!  Now I want Japanese writing paper.
triumph: i am feeling stronger about being around my family without drinking alcohol. i am less worried about this upcoming weekend (and entire weekend away at my lake house with my entire family. haven't spent a night sober there since i was a kid)..struggle: i am getting a new roommate soon. my old room mate (an obnoxious filthy slob) is moving out. i am nervous about change BUT i am trying to think positively. maybe the new roommate will be super chill and will actually get along with them instead of hating them. i still miss my toxic ex despite the fact that he was terrible to me. i know that it will just take time and i am allowing that. but i would be lying if i said it still doesn't really sting whenever i think about him...general: i have been trying to release emotions more often than holding it in and find that my anxiety is so much better as a result. i know that i am going through SO MUCH right now (sobriety living changes break up) but i am proud of myself as i feel like i am beginning to crawl from underneath it all to better handle each of them.  
**Triumph:** No booze for well over 18 months (can't really think of anything else at the moment...)..**Struggle:** Wife's new job means we're all up at 6am (if she's up I'm up. Know what I mean?) and I haven't got my new bodyclock yet...**General:** My maguffins all used to revolve around getting a drink. I trained my then very young daughters to ask if we could go to a certain bar that served food and was kid friendly which they though was fun. These days my latest maguffin was to get on bikes and go blackberry picking. Now I don't have wine to make I'm not that bothered about the blackberries but it gets us all out on bikes!
Triumph: Still have beer in the house as I'm waiting to give it to someone instead of dumping it out. I hadn't thought about it up until yesterday. This afternoon I suddenly felt my mouth start to water and that craving became so intense. I almost gave in but I reminded myself how much I'd be losing. After several minutes of struggling and tormenting myself I stood up put on my running clothes and ran just over a mile. Not a marathon run by any means but I'm back and no longer thinking about those beers. If the cravings persist tho those beers will be down the drain today. ..Struggle: Other than the major one above my brother is recently homeless and won't do the things he needs to do to turn himself around. He is also an alcoholic on top of being a sociopath sex offender and drug user. My family is willing to do anything to help him as long as he stops his drinking and gets a job but instead he just keeps lying to us and manipulating us. ..General: We're having apple cider and cider donuts tomorrow at work along with a corn hole tournament. I'm slightly obsessed with donuts which my boss is well aware of. She made sure I was aware of when and where said donuts would be put out so I could be first to enjoy them. She's the type of person to act like she doesn't care about anyone (even tho I know she does) so to have her blatantly think of me in that manner meant a lot. ..Happy Wednesday all! ..
Triumph: Cleaned my apartment am almost done with a big creative/for fun project and haven't missed a work out..Struggle: Found out I didn't get this job I really wanted and felt I was a good fit for BUT they did send me a nice letter telling me why and that it was a hard decision for them so they will keep me on file in case another position opens up. Honestly I was such I kind letter I have to write them a thank you note. .General: This has been a lot easier then I thought it would be. I never was a big drinker till I started this job and honestly I'm feeling like I'm lucky I don't have it that bad. I only ever drank 1 to 2 times a week and so I feel like this group has been great since their are all types. Wanting to quit to be healthy I think is a good enough reason and I like that I can talk about it without feeling judge. I feel like if you say I want to quit or cut back ppl (on the outside) are like "well do you have a problem? whats wrong with you blah blah blah" I think just wanting to be healthy and present is a good enough reason you don't need to be laid out on the street or whatever and I don't think we should be judge just for that. Glad I found this place with all types! Lets keep it up! :D 
Great about your liver tests!  Day 4 today for me.
Triumph: Had a rough few days woke up crying and went to the liquor store. I stood outside for 5 minutes contemplating it but decided to try a new restaurant instead! Top Bop is much better than alcohol...Struggle: relapsed binge drank said horrible things. Threatening suicide. Not fun...General: Back to the beginning. I will not drink. All the bottles are out of the house and it's time to stop feeling sorry for myself and get back to life.
**T:**  It's below 70 (F) degrees!!!  It's been in the mid 90's for almost 2 weeks straight.  Not normal at all.  We were in record highs almost everyday...It's very unsettling to see the leaves changing color falling to the ground when it's 90+ degrees outside...**S:**  Ugh failed my second exam of the semester.  I'm trying to not let it bring me down.  There's a lot of things I could have done different so that's something.  It's really disheartening when you try your best and you fail and you there isn't anything you could have done better.  ..**G:**  The human body is fucking amazing.  Yay Mary's liver.  People think that cirrhosis is this dreaded death sentence.  Cirrhosis is bad but what's really bad are the complications from cirrhosis.  Hep C jaundice ascites portal hypertension esophageal varicies liver cancer...  ..Lesson here:  if you get cirrhosis and get your shit together good things can happen. 
Congratulations sfgirlmary! Raising a La Croix to you...Triumph: I went to an Irish-Catholic funeral today and I did not drink at the reception even sitting at a table with people I mostly didn't know who were all drinking...Struggle: My SO's grandmother is kind of a toxic person and I had to interact with her today and she was ... toxic. Her behavior must bring up some deep-seated grade-school feelings about bullying or some shit. I don't know. In any case I could use a glass (or five) of wine to not feel feelings but I am not going to do that...General: My nose is getting smaller (or rather shrinking back down to its normal size). Hooray for vanity; I will not drink with you today!
Checking in
Triumph: I went and hung out with some friends tonight and had so much fun even though I had consumed no alcohol! I feel like I'm on top of the world. I didn't realize that fun times can be had without a drink or maybe or forgot what it's like. And now I'm left with no feelings of guilt or regret. I'm going to bed at a decent time and I will wakeup hangover free! ..Struggle: Food is taking the place of alcohol I'm eating so much more than before. I'm not sure what I'm going to do about this. I think I'm just going to concentrate on staying sober and when I get to a stable place start working on a healthier diet. Has anybody else struggled with this?..General: Another day down. I will not drink with all of you today!
