My biggest problem has been drinking to major excess on the weekends. I've officially made it through a Friday and Saturday night alcohol-free for probably the first time since I was legally able to buy it on my own. Damn. This puts me at 5 days!..The one day at a time mentality has been helping me a lot with both beer and food something else I struggle with. Clearly I will not be able to avoid unhealthy food forever and I'm still not even sure I'm ready to never drink again. I just know I'm not drinking right now. I didn't drink today and I don't plan to drink tomorrow. A book I've been reading has been helping me with this and understand being in the moment rather than future-seeking. That is exactly what I do. I've been viewing the work week as something I have to get through with the weekend being my reward where I can pig out and drink all I want to. ..After 5 days of eating healthy and abstaining from beer I can already see changes in my body. I work out pretty hard and consistently but still 20-30 pounds overweight. Alcohol and food addiction was/is the only thing standing in my way from looking pretty damn good. So getting through this first weekend is a pretty big deal. It helps that a good buddy of mine that I usually drink with has to work all weekend. ..I'm trying not to get too excited because I know I'm far from clear and there will be tougher times ahead. But one day at a time and today was a victory that I wanted to share.

What is the book you're reading? I'm in your same boat and I need some advise.

Well done on your weekend. One day at a time o r"just for today" is key. .When things get tough remember that you can break it down to hours and minutes as well. Keep thinking in manageable chunks and just string them together. ..Good luck wish you well.
The AA [Big Book](http://2travel.org/Files/AA/BigBook.pdf) is a profound work on alcoholism and addiction; don't take my word for it see [Marc Maron's interview on SLATE for a hip dude's view.](http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/09/02/marc_maron_alcoholism_and_drug_addiction_an_interview.html)
Well done little changes in daily habits make a lot of difference..I found not daily drinking helped me a lot.
