I always thought it meant when you have nothing left to lose. I can see that point to be very near. ...I turned 30 last month and I've always been in denial...What's the low point? I had an ex 6 years ago that was an alcoholic in recovery. And I only saw him relapse once.. I'd never seen anyone so drunk in my life until he blacked out. I grabbed his phone to desperately try to call his sponsor and found out he hadn't seen him in months. ..I don't know how to pinpoint the start of my own downward spiral. I never thought I had a problem. Even when I started drinking until I blacked out too. I knew it was wrong but not big of enough of an issue to stop. When my bf of 3 years moved out 2 years ago it was half a bottle of wine a night after work. And in two years it's descended to a 750 of scotch a night. Wtf...6 months ago I checked myself into the ER with Sepsis and gastrointestinal lesions. The worst pain of my entire life. I was admitted for a week. I almost died. I racked up thousands in medical bills. Two weeks after getting out I lost my job...I'd been doing really well in January. Drinking less gym a lot. Two weeks ago I got some bad news and later I went out drinking with 2 friends. I got black out drunk and completely destroyed my friendship with one of them: Aided by dozens of drunk texts that I have no recollection or writing around 9pm on the way home. And I woke up next to the guy I'd been hooking up with. He's a sweet guy. I messed things up with him due to drunk texting a few nights later. But not before.....Later that same weekend I met up with the other friend. I'd had a bit to drink before hand. Not a lot by my standards. We went for dinner then out to a bar. I only remember having two drinks there. .... I woke up in the ER...I had collapsed on the sidewalk when we left the bar.  He called 911...I'm lucky I didn't hurt myself more...*That was my moment.*..-----..* Not when I got black out drunk in a Tokyo miles from my hotel outside of the city with a dead cellphone and no idea how I got back safely..* Not when my drinking ruined my 3 year relationship. .* Not when (after the break up) my drinking lead to me hooking up with a mutual friend or another mutual friend or another mutual friend..* Not when I blacked out at a rooftop party in front of mutual friends and had to get staples in my head. .* Not when I got wasted at family Thanksgiving. .* Not when I drank my mom's booze. .* Not when I blacked out and cried at family Christmas. .* Not when I lost 3 back to back high paying jobs. .* Not when getting blackout drunk and harassing a client/friend. Or when sleeping with him in spite of knowing it was a mistake. .* Not when I lost my phone on vacation with friends not when I slipped and hurt myself on a wet sidewalk the next..* Not when I lost my brand new phone a week later when I got blackout at a club with coworkers .. woke up on my couch at home with my super's key. .. I had left my purse at the club which had the key to my bedroom I had to then break into to get to my laptop to retrace my steps. (Went back to retrieve it and they remembered me. I was "night and day".. I had no idea what they were talking about.).* Not when I started only showering when I had plans.  .* Not when I could only make it to evening plans if I had two days notice. .* Not when taking out my recycling was 80% wine bottles. .* Not when the guy at the wine store started to look sad whenever he saw me. And would say "be safe"..* Not when that shame pushed me to using phone and online delivery. Or when I started cycling the sources bc the delivery guys woild recognize me. .* Not when that recycling turner into 80% hard liquor. .* Not even realizing I've spent close to $1250 in the last month on alcohol. Money I don't have.. ..It's not that none of them aren't humiliating enough in their own right and every single one plus a thousand things before that should have been the point. **Years ago**. ...Something about that moment that profound and immediate and direct humiliation. .---..So I've been thinking of my identity my sense of self. My sense of self worth. ..I don't know who I even am anymore. I've lost my hobbies interests friends health a decade of savings relationships years of career progression. ..I hate what I see in the mirror. ..From 29 good looking 6 figures with my own apartment in NYC ..to.. 30 loss of health unemployed 2 months behind on rent with savings and retirement almost totally wiped out... .Idk. The friend that called 911 has been cool says he still wants to hang out. Wants to get a beer. I'm thinking for both our sakes it would be better not happening. But as pathetic as it sounds - he seems like one of the last few people who even wants to see me anyhow. ..-----..I've read a lot of the posts here; they've been so helpful. Especially the comfort with being *ok* with not being busy. Being ok being bored. That it's ok to do the lazy things that get me through the day without drinking. Because it was the pressures and stresses of failing achievement that pushed me even further into drinking.  ...-------..*4 days.* And hopefully a small victory: I asked friends to change the location of dinner tomorrow for something seated rather than a bar feel- and told them I wouldn't be drinking (because of my "diet".. but still)..When I wake up it'll be 5... and I wish I had more hope for 6. But hopefully the understanding of the spiral that will begin with even one drink.. ...Thanks for letting me get this off my chest somewhere.

What you say resonates so hard with me.  I also had so many similar "bottoms" that should have been  a wake-up call.  The good news is you never have to live that way again.  I'm having a terrible depressed night but it's still better than any night I was drinking.  You can do this.  It's not forever it's just one day at a time.  I'll be thinking about you and cheering you on.
Beginning of my journey as well (day 9)... I can identify with a lot of this. Getting too drunk at family gatherings messing things up with friends missing opportunities wasting money buying booze too many times from one store and having the cashier be the only other person that knows you have a problem... ..I guess all I wanna say is if you made a decision to stop you've made a decision you wanna live and make a change. And so have I and so have many people here. Stop by IRC if you need some friendly chats and take care of yourself &lt;3
Wow. It sounds so much like me that it's not even funny. Except I never made a list like that...even a year later it would be so difficult to bring myself to write it all out. Yeah... I'd on know why it happened when it did it certainly could have happened a million times earlier and I had tried several times but suddenly I woke up one morning and I knew that-was-it. I could not take it anymore. I was sure that it was either suicide or stopping and I really have far too big of a fear of death and love for my family for suicide. So as I lay in bed looking at my closet seeing that it's too short to hang from I said a very earnest prayer. I'll never forget that moment. I begged for help and I have no religion. I just asked anything anyonr my dead ancestors something to help me. Then I read sd for the next 4 days I clung to everyone's stories like life preservers. By day 5 I had built up just enough strength to get my ass to an aa meeting and the rest is history.  .2 things that helped were hearing on sd that if I stopped I would never have to feel that way again and that bottom is just where we stop digging. .Best wishes :)
It was the bottles for me. Bottles everywhere... Hurts to think about actually. Being here is a great step...Please keep posting and follow up! I've 'bonded' to a degree with some folks here and that added support for a generally lonely person like me is a game changer...Keep fighting keep coming back. Keep believing in yourself. You're here because you haven't given up and you know there's still a LOT of good in life left to salvage. Reach out if you ever need support! - xJT
I identify with a lot of what you said.  SO many blackouts - the worst were Thanksgiving and Christmas 3 years in a row.  Embarrassing my husband.  Waking up with red and anxiety trying to piece together my night.  Grabbing my phone praying I didn't text my boss something crazy.  It's a terrible way to live.  I have been working on this for years and I have 24 days. It is so surprising how fast life gets better.  The first week sucks - but I guess it's true no pain no gain.  I did an outpatient/therapy/group and it was eye opening.  SD has been a god send - how we all see ourselves in each other is so helpful.  You can do it!  I won't drink with you today! 
"So I've been thinking of my identity my sense of self. My sense of self worth. I don't know who I even am anymore."..^ This.  So much this.  I completely relate to it.  Really everything you wrote about I could feel.  ..I went to a family Thanksgiving at a relative's house who lives about 45 minutes south of my city.  I brought along a close family friend.  And I purposely decided that I would drive us because I was committed to staying sober for this single dinner - as I'd embarrassed myself so many times before.  I even told myself "Just make it through the 2 hour event drive back and you can drink as much as you want when you get home."  Like... I had *specifically planned* for weeks in advance to be sober for 2 hours at this one single event. I chose to drive to it because this was one thing I was committed to doing...And I got so fucking blackout drunk my brother-in-laws family members were begging me not to drive back.  I must've told them my family friend would be driving but I didn't tell the family friend that - who somehow hand't noticed my state throughout the night.  I got behind the wheel with him as passenger. Within minutes he noticed something was seriously wrong and began pleading for me to pull over... and ultimately I did in some random parking lot.  He took the keys and got us home - thank god.  ..**Who have I become?**..I'm somebody who cannot handle 120 minutes with no alcohol - despite every single fucking intention -  and even more importantly will put the lives of loved ones and countless innocent strangers in danger.  I don't know me anymore.  It's such a deeply horrifying feeling when you realize that you're truly not in control of your own life at all.    ..I'm sober tonight.  I'm stringing together more and more sober nights.  I have nothing left to do but trust these people here that if I just don't pick up that first drink it can somehow find my way back...So sorry I turned this into my own massive rant.  But I *completely* related to your post. It made me feel much less alone here.  There's people who've come before us who have done this.  
Wow hon I am so glad you are here with us.  You have a lot to teach us and together we can be strong.  
Your post made me cry. I really related to it. Well done. Keep going. I am not drinking with you.
This really really hit home. For someone who has been in a similar situation very recently I would implore you to stay sober. Stay sober until Monday and take it from there. ..Your mind will improve rapidly the same with your mood. And you *will* find another job. You were able to get a 6 figure job in New York at one point you certainly will find another job! It might be a step back but just imagine how quickly you will bounce back with a reinvigorated mind in your arsenal!..Not to sound too cheesy but this is not the end for you it's merely the beginning of the beginning. You were lucky to make this realization at 30 I'm 37 myself and feel damn lucky I realized before I was 50... 
Your post is scarily close to my story WOW. I could have written it down to age and nyc. Especially switching to delivery service and even rotating that. I'm almost 30 and am realizing I too have no idea who i am. lts terrifying but I hear a lot of hope on this sub. I'm just done with my first sleepless night so here's to day 2!
Yeah about time... ..Welcome.   As for boredom busy. You might check out meetings of one sort or another. Try one try em all.   Helped me immensely in the beginning- and now
Good morning. I know you can do this and you are a better person for it. 
Thanks for the post. Not drinking with you today.
I will not drink with you today and I am pulling for you. Each day sober is a victory. Fight like hell. You can turn this around. Good luck.
You are among friends here.  I don't miss the mystery bruises after getting drunk.  I don't miss the medical bills from a stay in the ICU because I went on the bender from hell and I don't miss feeling like garbage because somewhere deep inside I knew that I was capable of actually living a good meaningful life.  I am beginning to rediscover the helpful trustworthy person that I knew was inside of me all along.  I always used to tell my husband "I'm a bad girl trying to be good."  That isn't the truth.  I'm a good person who was hurting and doing bad things.  I hope that you and I both can let the hurt go and find happiness &amp; peace in sobriety today.
Wow. I got goosebumps reading this post. Inspiring. Stay strong. 
This really spoke to me; it was sort of like reading someone's account of my earlier years... please do what you can to take care of yourself because the next decade won't be nearly as - uhmm- pretty...
Thank you for sharing this list - so heartwrenchingly honest it really spoke to me. My list has many similarities to yours. The shame panic regret and guilt. We can all grow from this and recover. I'm with you in not drinking today! All the best to you!
Welcome!  You can do this.  It feels amazing to not add anything more to my list of alcohol shocks and shames.  I can't believe how many things I tossed up to misadventures or mistakes fretted over tons but then just kept on going on the same path.  No more!  I will not drink with you today.
