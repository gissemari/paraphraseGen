Do you regret things from the past?  One day you will need to figure out how to forgive yourself.

We all have regrets.  Believe me. I think making amends is part of the healing process. My plan is to make amends by showing those I love and hurt that I can do better. 
Every day I think about the mistakes I have made.  It's something I really struggle with and often find myself dwelling on things in an unhealthy way.  Recently I have found the only thing that helps is to try letting go of that and living in the present.  I have certainly learned from my actions in my past but I cannot change them and no amount of dwelling on them will make any difference.  So right now I'm taking it a day at a time.  Today I will be kind compassionate and polite to others.  Today I will focus on the tasks set before me.  Today I will be the best that I can be.  Just for today I will not drink.
