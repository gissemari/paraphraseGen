We were at a bar tonight supporting a friend who recently got promoted to bartender. He is incredibly supportive of my sobriety and while it was a bit of a challenging night for my husband and I drank our soda's I got a chocolate cannoli that was amazing and we didn't most of the night laughing with friends. I was glad I decided to go despite the challenges and felt it was good to get out into our social group...As I discussed my thoughts and challenges with my husband once we were back home one of the things I remarked was that I'm unsure if I'll ever drink again or not. I try not to stress about it and it's the one very significant area of my life where I don't have a definite plan. I'm sober now and that's what matters. But it got me thinking about what I would have to feel in order to think it was an okay idea. ..For me it comes down to this fact: I never drank at low speed from day one it was drink to get drunk as fast as possible and then start that way as long as possible. I still struggle to unpack my motivations but the greatest hits were escaping a poor mental health situation wanting to be able to separate myself from the consequences of my actions needing to truly relax and wanting to feel confident/badass/cool/whatever. The point is having a drink was never just having a drink. It was never like going and filling my co to with ice tea is. I'm not expecting the yes to some my emotional problems I just want it to be cool and sweet and refreshing. If someday having an alcoholic beverage feels that way then that's when I would be okay trying it again...So the question I was thinking was an I alone in this? Was there ever a time when an alcoholic drink was nothing more than a beverage? Or was a drink always something more? .

I'm in the same boat I never had just one I always had to get pretty drunk  eventually I got blacked out a lot and yeah i came to realize I just need to be sober 
When a drink was just a drink it wasn't very remarkable and I could take it or leave it. I don't remember those drinks or any especially special times with a drink when it was just a drink. So I don't think I'd try to recreate such an unremarkable thing now when the risk of lighting up my old circuits is so great. The drinks I remember are the *drunks* until I couldn't remember anything much anymore. I don't want that old amber-soaked life. I want to remember everything. :-)
