Nothing it sucks and still makes you miserable. Don't go back I did it so you don't have to. ..Getting really sick of these badge resets. Going to try taking up a new hobby or something to resort to as a coping mechanism. Maybe start playing hockey again. Definitely going to be taking my meetings more seriously not missing a single one from here on out. Anything is better than this misery.

Well you've clearly learned something... you've learned that something needs to change. That you need to work harder at your recovery. That relapses come with loads of guilt and shitty feelings...Those of us who have had success post-relapse (myself included) have learned these same things. You know what you need to do now do it. Use this feeling and remember it next time you think about grabbing a drink or "trying moderation". ..Pick yourself up and try again. Don't beat yourself up too much. You've already done that (I know easier said than done). You got this but let us know how we can help.
Hi BrinxJob I'm right there with you.
Why did you relapse? What are you going to do differently this time?  These are the questions you need to ask yourself.  Until I learned I needed to actually listen to people with experience I kept trying to do it "my way". Well that didn't work so I humbled myself and started to listen and do the work I needed to do.  I didn't always like it but I did it anyway. Sometimes I feel like people take a relapse too lightly.  
I'm so glad you came back! Thanks for this post this is exactly what I find so useful about this group. We all make mistakes we can learn from each other. ..Personally I think a new hobby is a good idea for me having a schedule has been invaluable. Making appointments a priority keeps me accountable and on track. When I drink the first thing to go is my schedule yknow?..You can do this!
I wouldn't thank anyone for their relapse but I do thank you for posting about it.  Hearing how shitty they are has helped me over the past few months.  I'm glad you're back on it and are looking at ways to make it work better this time that's that part you can do.  Just be sober now and the rest will fall in place!
Hey /u/BrinxJob. You learned that whatever it is you're doing it ain't working...Sounds like you have some ideas. When I was faltering good intentions didn't help me much. "taking my meetings more seriously" -- what does that mean exactly? " Going to try taking up a new hobby or something... " seems kinda vague and squishy. Exactly when is that happening and how is that going to help you get through **today?** Because you need to get through today....What helped me was some immediate **action**. Make a call now. If meetings are your support get to one *today*. That sort of thing. Something definite and actionable. ..What do you think?..
I was a serial relapser myself it's such  terrible feeling I know. You're on the right track though! USE those tools you get from here and AA and a hobby  (or two) won't hurt. I've started bird watching again having an awesome time with that as well as lots of fitness stuff to get rid of the unattractive 20 pounds I put on when I was drinking . Good luck you'll get there!
&gt; Definitely going to be taking my meetings more seriously not missing a single one from here on out...Then son I'd say you had a successful relapse.  It took me 7 years after I relapsed to draw that lesson.

Give yourself a break you're allowed to fail. This is life we are human. We are destined to gravitate towards chaos. We are trying to fight the primal urge of self destruction. You will get better chin up and try again.
Maybe you did learn something. Maybe it was a lesson that no matter what you cant drink. I tested the water many times myself. Sometimes lasting years &amp; others weeks to months. In the end though i have now finally come to terms that i just cant. About what you said about taking your meetings more seriously. I think that is a very good choice not that I'm currently involved in meetings though i do think being pro-active about sobriety is very important. .Best of luck to you you can do it!
