As someone who has been struggling with sobriety I can't help but think of a few things- liver/kidney failure I don't think he was sober when he passed I can't help but feel his drinking caused this.  I know people who "drank themselves to death" and multiple organ failure was what happened.  The dementia he claims his mom had it but it could have been brought on by drinking.  Some of the reasons I have been trying so hard to get &amp; stay sober is I was fearing the early stages of "wet brain" and also worried about my liver #s after having blood work done.  Alcohol is a POISON it maims it kills.  RIP David.

He got all his DUIs after age 60. I think it's possible he was drinking to cope with the dementia. The slurring isn't something I've come across with dementia patients. They are confused paranoid and shaky but they usually speak slowly clearly with a lot of pauses. Alcoholism is insane and sad. That man had talent.
It's possible.
The truth which most suspected seem to be coming out after the fact. His daughter who hasn't seen him for several years comments on social media. I think there was something going on here for a while not just after 'a' diagnosis for dementia. Alcohol by itself is bad enough throw in any other legal and illegal drugs he was toast. ..
U/MissKayNYC did you read what David Cassidy's final words were? His daughter reported that his last words were  So much wasted time.  I thought of this post when I read that. His words reflect how I feel about the time I spent drinking/drugging and I wonder if that isn't what he meant. They say he needed a liver transplant so that would be in line with your theory.  RIP David Caddidy.
