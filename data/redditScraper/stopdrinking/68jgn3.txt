[End of Day 12. Long day full of being outdoors and staying active. I did one meeting I meditated for the first time in ... omg prob like a year... I did some more real prep did the farmers market grocery store saw some people I am starting to consider my friends at OMAGOD. Also when filling out my [journal](http://imgur.com/a/VurrN) tonight I realized.... my mood over all today was "happy" ** the last time it said anything better than "content" was [Nov 12th](http://imgur.com/a/hLp7O) at 54 days sober and it says "accomplished happy and satisfied".... I am not quite there yet but damn does it feel good to be kinda getting back to me.... but that also brings to light that means I started slipping in Dec in fact I didn't even use my journal after Dec 11... I had 4 months a barely keeping my head above water before I stared drowning in a bottle again. 4 months where I could have reached out but never did - I know I wasn't paying attention to the red red flags but I can't believe I was blind for that long to all the signs that something is up &&&& I never did ask for help my family had to break out the fishing net and reel me back in. So again very thankful to them...On a brighter not I made [General Tso](http://imgur.com/a/7kxJn) for dinner tonight.  A week ago I literally could barely stand and ate 4 grapes and half a handful of tortilla chips in three days - that is all I could do. Now I am over here making a freaking science experiment basically lol. I am remembering who I am and what I enjoy I am remembering what keeps me sane and sober - I am very happy and thankful. ..[Tonight's meeting](http://imgur.com/a/w0akN) was on triggers and how to deal with them. I have to admit I zoned out a few times but I did keep it productive. I connected some dots on why I relapsed and found even more things to be grateful for. I did pick up on some red flags others had that I need to keep an eye on and that I recognized that I didn't drink to get buzzed - I drank for oblivion. To feel nothing to be checked out completely. I am not a normal person. I am an alcoholic. I cannot have one drink for me there is no such thing. I can be a better person I can be happy - the answer is not in the bottom of a bottle so I am done looking...[High Five](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg)

Love this!! I've always tried to find my answers and myself at the bottom of the bottle  . Funny thing is you have to use one eye to see down the bottle so obviously you aren't seeing much well I never saw much at least! I saw a lot of disappointment unhappiness and just straight up misery. Well not now! Now we are on a path of happiness! Congrats on your 12 days and your cooking
