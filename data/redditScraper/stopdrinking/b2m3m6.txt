I was pretty worried that I would struggle this weekend and I did a little bit but I made it through! I had a super productive weekend where I actually ***left my house*** and was able to stay in the sun most of the day for Saturday and Sunday. We watched baseball on Saturday and I took my kids to an amusement park Sunday (St. Patty's). I struggled a bit while walking around and seeing people drink tall cans which made me crave one too as I had expected but I resisted. I knew I wouldn't stop at one tall can and it would've ended up with me at a liquor store to put whiskey in my soda eventually. So instead of drinking my family and I rode tons of rides all day long and played at the beach. We came home I did everyone's laundry had everyone take showers made dinner and get to bed early. Now I am at work and I am energetic and feeling really good opposed to some of my other coworkers who's eyes are puffy and have a purplish tint to their skin. I plan on going to a meeting after work as well...If I was drinking this would not be possible at all. My kids had an amazing weekend and this is going to be the first of many more to come! I am feeling really proud of myself for one whole week down for the books! Last time I went this long without alcohol I felt like I was white knuckling it but this time I just feel really good about myself. Each day brings me more confidence.

Awesome! Great job. I'm sure your kids were thrilled. .IWNDWYT 
Good to hear that OP. I didn't not have a productive weekend and was drunk most of it. But I'm taking the straps. I WANT TO QUIT. Glad you had a wonderful weekend. It sounds like you had a wonderful time!!
Sounds like a great weekend!
