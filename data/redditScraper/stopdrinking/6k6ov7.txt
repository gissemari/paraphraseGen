I've relapsed and want to stop but the last time it resulted in seizures and hallucinations. I just spent 20 minutes vomiting I'm not even drunk just topping up. I know the logical answer is "stop drinking" I know that already. Is there any advice to ease myself back into sobriety? I don't think I was getting drunk but drinking for 3 days so I don't think the withdrawal will be too bad. It's got to the point where my body is just rejecting alcohol (which is good) but there's the chemical addiction. Mentally I'm fine I hate the stuff it's getting off the shit is the problem.

Did you get medical help last time you stopped? The seizures and hallucinations sound awful.
You need to detox with medical supervision if you're having DTs. Have you considered inpatient treatment? It's a great starting point to get a few weeks sober get your head on straight and get the physical malady under control while you learn some things and get prepared for what comes next.
You might google "Kindling Effect".  I'd speak to my medical provider.
Please if at all possible see a health professional.
