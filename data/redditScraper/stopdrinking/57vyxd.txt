**The Outside Trigger**..I drank nearly everyday for a year and a half. I'm in my mid-20s and I live with my parents because my father is chronically ill. He has progressed significantly in the past few years. It became too much for me at a certain point to come home everyday to see my dad in severe pain inching towards death. We've had numerous failures with in-house caretakers due to budget and my dad's specific needs. Combine that with stress from a job I hate and a lack of coping skills and we have ourselves a drinking problem. ..**The Inside Trigger**..I'm a naturally anxious person. I worry about a lot of things. My dad in constant pain my mom who barely gets any sleep because she's basically on call 24 hours a day (and has been talking about grand plans to organize and rearrange rooms and go through all the boxes in the garage since we moved in 8 years ago but can't even keep the kitchen counter clean for more than a day) and my inner conflict of badly wanting to leave but feeling guilty because I know things will fall apart more than they already are. My parents have both said they know I'm unhappy at my job and that I should never stay because of them. The problem is I don't know what I'd do if I left. I make decent money and there is a lot of opportunity to move up. I have a BA from a major university but I don't have any passions hobbies or notable skills (although my sarcasm game is strong).  I feel like if I'm not leaving to pursue some grand dream of mine or for a job that is more fulfilling or pays a lot more then I'm just running away. And that makes me feel like a piece of shit. ..**The Many Relapses**..As my neurosis got worse I discovered alcohol was the only thing that numbed me to my dad's declining health and quieted my thoughts from the mental stresses of paragraph 2. Around May I decided to stop drinking because I started blacking out and my stomach had a dull but constant feeling of discomfort. I took a vacation didn't drink at all for a week came home didn't drink at all for another week felt great then dad had a particularly bad day and I relapsed. Now about once every few weeks I try to stop again and make it 3-7 days before being overwhelmed by everything from the first 2 paragraphs. ..Now I should probably see a medical doctor and a therapist but I don't know how to go about that and talking to people on the phone makes me nervous and I hate leaving the house because doing things is exhausting. ...**TL;DR** I relapse after 3-7 days because my home life is stressful and I become overwhelmed from the wave of emotions and anxiety that I've been numb to because of the drinking. I'm totally lost career-wise and it keeps me from moving out because my mom needs too much help taking care of my sick father. I don't know what advice or whatever I'm even looking for. I just couldn't sleep and felt compelled to share.

This is usually when I relapse too I can relate...I'm sorry you're going through so much. ..I'm working to learn more about why I drink and scared I'll never be able to stop failing...I am here for you in thought let's prove to ourselves we can succeed. 
I'm the same way I can make the first few days pretty easily it's the next week after that that's really difficult for me because the emotional issues become louder again as the pain from the last drinking episode starts to wear off...I think that's why the daily check ins here are helpful deciding not to drink for just that one day no matter what happens good or bad because I often use a bad event as an excuse to drink...I'm on day 3 as well. Just going to focus on day 4. You're not alone.
I was reading old posts and a mod made a comment to a poster that their problem wasn't needing to quit they did that every day (because no one drinks literally 24/7 and the person had quit for days in a row previously) the real challenge and need was to stop starting...I found that so profound just now..Indeed I need to not start and figure out why I end up talking myself into it when my internal dialogue is telling me how much I'll regret it.
The same feelings happened to me.  In particular the anxiety.  I was so terrified that my life had become an endless cycle of drinking trying to quit failing drinking again.  It was misery...AA changed my life.  It does NOT have to be how it is right now.  There are plenty that can help you.  Even if it seems hopeless like really really really really hopeless it isn't.  You can do this.
I have the exact same problem. I have stopped drinking for 4-7 days about 12 times this year. Each time I relapse the consequences are even worse than the last time I did it. This week has been extremely rough I have white knuckled the crap out of this week and it's so easy to just forget how hard I've worked for one lousy escape. .. Ignore that voice that tells you 'just one'... it's never just one. The consequences are not worth it. You can make it I will be here staying sober with you today.
A lot of this sounds all too familiar to me as I'm sure it does to many others...I too struggled with the idea of seeing a doctor and this was compounded my the fact that I've been seeing the same doctor since I was 13 years old.  I can't count how many times in the past several years (I'm now 28) that I had gone into his office for something or another fully with the intent to finally disclose my depression anxiety and serious alcohol abuse and yet walking out the door at the end of the appointment having not said anything.  It was at least 4 years from when I first wanted to say something until I actually did it.  I really regret this.  There were so many opportunities where I could have gotten help where I could have started the process but I chickened out...Just remember that these professionals are there to help.  Telling my doctor about these issues was not easy but since then he's referred me to a psychiatrist whom I see once a month.  The psychiatrist has referred me to my local "addiction centre" where I have my first appointment with an addictions counsellor on Thursday.  Things are moving forward...Let's not drink today.
