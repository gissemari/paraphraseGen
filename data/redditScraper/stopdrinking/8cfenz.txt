Friday is the hard part. It is when all of my demons get the loudest. On other weekdays I've trained myself to be able to say no because of an understanding that if I don't I will lose my job. And I've experienced enough unemployment to know how dangerous that would be. On Saturday I'm home so there's an added layer of protection away from the bad places. But on Friday after a difficult work week having to walk passed countless bars and establishments I can always hear a voice in my head whispering "Just one."..I suffer from depression. It was always there but it became truly unbearable after I graduated from college. Drinking had always been a problem but back then the extent of my problem was invisible because of my youthful ignorance and the culture of bad habits in college. I left the city my school is in and in the process left all the friends that I relied on. I also left the girl I love who meant the world to me. ..For me the professional struggles of early adulthood have included unemployment low-pay work and mundane entry-level roles. I have slowly lost a sense of direction of where my life is going and how I could possibly get there. Privately I deal with abandonment issues intense loneliness and self-hate among other internal challenges. ..Being isolated I self-medicate with alcohol. I turn to it even though I know I am only creating a litany of problems future me will have to navigate through. I turn to it because of how it makes me numb. That I don't feel inadequate or hurt or negative. ..But of course for me there's no end when I start. I suffer from a form of alcoholism where it is basically impossible for me to stop when I've started. So after the numbness comes the blackness comes the waking up (hopefully) in my bed fearfully looking at my bank account my phone (if I still have it) my wallet (if I still have it) and my belongings if I was carrying any (oftentimes left at the establishment or lost). And finally the sinking feeling of knowing that one or two or many things have gone terribly wrong as I decide how much recovery can I get my hungover self to do...Friday is the hard part. I fucked up this past Friday. Some of my belongings are missing I wasted a ridiculous amount of my pay and I called the girl I loved for almost 4 years a year and half after we mutually broke up in response to my move. I was so humiliated. Of course I apologized and let her know I was taking her # off of my list. That was hard. What was harder was knowing this would probably be the last time we ever communicated because I know I am too emotionally attached to ever be able to transition to friends...So now I am left with a greater understanding of how to beat my alcoholism. I am developing a game-plan for every Friday so that I am never left with nothing to do because that is dangerous. M-Th (+Sunday) I am confident I will continue to beat. Saturday is tricky and will require planning around as well but the starting point of home will make it easier than Friday. I'm also planning to reengage in the weight room and to start taking acting classes to occupy time...Life is hard. Drinking makes it much harder. But I am hopeful this setback will only strengthen my resolve. Or at least that's what I must tell myself.

Welcome aboard!..Your story is our story and you're not alone......For me I had to accept that there's no such thing as 'Just One' and if my mind tries to convince me otherwise I come here to read or post until I come back to my senses!..The book [Alcohol Explained](http://alcoholexplained.com/about-alcohol-explained/) explains alcohol and alcoholism from a chemical physiological and psychological standpoint and is very enlightening indeed.....The book and YouTube Channel [*This Naked Mind*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4KpBxerD_BIksjUfUT4hVw/videos) are also fantastic and helped me enormously... ..Dispelling the illusion that alcohol is just a harmless bit of fun and understanding *why* I ended up drinking so much has made a big difference... Having the support of this community and the above resources has been an absolute game-changer hope you'll find the same!..I won't drink with you today ..Woody :&gt;)&gt;.
Another kick at the can MK!  Sounds to me like you're determined with a solid plan and everything.  Nice!  You can do this.  IWNDWYT or this weekend!
