I'm struggling with staying sober but I did have a small victory...On Saturday I went to a house party and two bars. I did not drink at the house party however being in a bar got to me and someone bought me a drink and away we go...I need to learn to be strong enough to say no but I am getting there. I know merely being in a bar is bad but now I know I can be around drinking people not drink AND still have fun...I didn't binge but I did end up drunk. However I drunk significantly less than I normally do. It's fucked my health up though. Why must everyone I know celebrate anything by drinking?..I'm going to keep trying the "pushing it later and later" technique next time. ..IWNDWYT.
