I have struggle with alcohol use for the past few years and have gotten to the point that I know I need to stop drinking. I am 28 years old soon to be 29 and was recently married in October. I have gotten to the point that I am lying to my wife about my drinking hiding my demon. But she's smart and I inevitably slip up. We are planning on trying for kids soon and she told me "How can I trust you to be alone with our children if I am worried you are drunk?"..That was devastating. I am going to go to a meeting tonight and I plan on trying to find some counseling to help. I don't really know what steps to take to make this stay but I know I need to take them.

Read alcohol explained. Since I've read that it's very hard to even want a drink once you understand why and how alcohol works. If you plan on stopping while thinking you miss alcohol then that is very hard but this book literally made me no longer desire alcohol and I feel excited now that I don't need to drink anymore. Naked mind is another good one but I liked the more in depth stuff in alcohol explained. Good luck! 
Welcome!  This is a great welcoming encouraging outlet and I hope you take advantage of it.  .I Will Not Drink With You Today
Try going to the meeting tonight and getting there early so you can talk to people. Stay late so you can talk to people. Tell people whats going on and ask for help.
