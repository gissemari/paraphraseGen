Has anyone stopped drinking and NOT have a relapse?
----------immediate responses--------

Absolutely. ..It's often said that **"relapse is part of recovery."**  I couldn't disagree with that any more strongly. Relapse is certainly *often* a part of recovery but there's no reason whatsoever that it has to be. ..I have a choice every single day whether or not I drink again and I've made the choice not to and I have acted accordingly every day since I quit.  And I will do it again tomorrow.  We all have that choice - it's not an easy one by any stretch and I realize that it's harder for some than others. ..One awesome thing about SD is that any time someone does relapse people come out of the woodwork to make sure the individual doesn't feel too bad about it/themselves.  This is a truly beautiful thing but I do think there's some danger in normalizing relapse and making it seem inevitable. 
This is my first time seriously trying to quit and I haven't had relapsed. What's worked for me so far is every morning I promise myself I'm not going to drink just for today no matter what. I don't promise myself I won't drink tomorrow because I honestly might. But for today it's a nah for me dawg. It's simple but it's what's worked for me so far. Hope that helped a little :)

Yes I have not had a drink for almost 35 years. Not everyone relapses.

Define relapse.  For me that would be daily drinking again.  One or two glasses of wine daily constitutes a relapse for me in my mind.  Someone else might consider that level of drinking successful moderation.  For some a teaspoon of vanilla extract in whipped cream is a failure to avoid alcohol.  You have to figure out for yourself what a relapse is.  
No relapse here.  (I started to say "not yet" but that sounds like I expect one.  Just to clarify I don't expect to relapse nor do I want to.)..I will support those who do relapse because I can't walk in their shoes and know what was on their mind when it happened.  The important thing is to realize the mistake and start over.  It's a humbling experience I'm sure.
I "quit" and "relapsed" quite a few times but to be honest I don't think I had really accepted that I just can't drink during those prior "quits". I finally accepted the truth without reservations 52 months ago and I honestly believe I will never drink again. I am so grateful to be done with it. 
NIAAA notes that 90% will relapse in the first 4 years. Strict abstinence is a very good route for some but it's not the only way by a long shot. ..I used The Sinclair Method cut my addiction to alcohol by over 95%  and have been drinking below low-risk limits for about a year now. I used spend over $400 to drink over 300 US units of alcohol per month. Now it takes me a month to go through what I used to drink in a day. ..It works backwards from the traditional approach I started out drinking and with the help of Naltrexone decreased my desire to drink month by month. I'd been drinking daily for over 30 years but 6 months of The Sinclair Method just blew the addiction to bits. There's nothing left to resist or stave off anymore I largely just don't care about or think about alcohol. ..Naltrexone blocks the endorphins from drinking but you still get the calming/anxiolytic effect from drinking (and you get drunk if you overdrink). But the endorphins are required to reinforce the addiction and without them the addiction started to fade bit by bit. ..I still have to take the pill when I drink but that's only 5 pills a month or less. The Naltrexone is out of patent and pretty inexpensive here in the US.  I did the whole thing out of pocket and it came around $500 for the whole 6 months doc blood tests and pills included. GoodRx is a great website to get an electronic discount "coupon" on meds that can be used at a local pharmacy if your insurance doesn't cover you. No signup or registration needed no fees. Check Costco and Sam's Club too they can come in even cheaper and you don't need a membership to use their pharmacy or optical department. 
I have not. Not do I plan to. I mean I know one doesn't plan to relaps but I only make stupid decisions when I'm drunk. I'm not drunk so why would I decide to drink. I quit chocolate 21 years ago and didn't relapse once. And reading about others relapsing helps. I've never read anyone say "I had a relaps but can now comfortably drink in moderation!!""
This is my first real attempt at sobriety but I am nowhere close to out of the woods yet! I feel like I'm getting more and more distance from it but booze still has a lot of power over me.
