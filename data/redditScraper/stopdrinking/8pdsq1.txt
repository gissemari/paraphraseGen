The highlight of my last few days has been going to bed and using one of my tools to mark my day as AFD (Alcohol-Free Day)..When I was struggling terribly with depression I kept a  Gratitude Journal' to help me find positives in my life then I fell out of the habit. Recently I was at the very bottom of my darkness again and I found a Gratitude app to start the practise up again. Whilst trying to avoid alcohol it helps me to shift my focus onto finding 3 new things a day to add to my journal. It's a distraction a nice way to remind myself of wins in life (however small) and has inspiring quotes along the way. I honestly feel that this process has the power to change your perspective from the unconscious outwards. I add AFD as my fourth thing for every day I make it through which gives me such satisfaction...The other thing I've gone back to since my last sober stint is listening to Louise Haye - Self-Esteem Affirmations (you can buy it or just stream it on YouTube I believe it). It goes straight to your subconscious and is another powerful practise (once you can get over the corniness of it). A listen a day can help keep negative thoughts at bay. ..Thank you for the suggestions on here as well I am willing to try anything that will help bring out my natural self. I just started reading This Naked Mind as mentioned by a couple of you guys...
