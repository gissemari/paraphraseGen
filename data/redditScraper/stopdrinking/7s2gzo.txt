Just a check in. This sub has been very helpful and a couple members helped give me some direct feedback to keep me from making a quick relapse... Last time i tried to stop drinking i made it two weeks and convinced myself i needed to have a drink to have fun and that it wouldn't hurt anything. ..Well i am resolved this time not to make that mistake again. Coming here to keep myself honest. The pain from drinking isn't worth the illusion of fun.
