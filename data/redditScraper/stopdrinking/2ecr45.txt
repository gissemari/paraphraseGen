It's the last morning of vacation and I'm up early [preparing to Snoo](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2dvg6t/this_morning_i_am_snoo/) and thinking how proud and happy I am that I've stayed sober all week. I enjoyed all the little  luxuries of being at the beach I was present for my family and the intention and dedication I invested into my sobriety has paid me back in aces...Here's how I did it:..* I made sure I was comfortable. Whether that meant packing extra comfy pajamas or bringing along  fancy coffees and my favorite mug I ensured that I had a few markers of my "real" life outside vacation to ground me each day...* I woke up each morning threw my arms up in the air and said "I will not drink today!" (thanks u/coolcrosby)..* I exercised every day whether it was a training run a bike ride or just a walk down the beach...* I spent time each day reading from [some new recovery books](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2dlfgf/two_more_recovery_book_recommendations/)...* I spent at least 30 minutes a day here on r/stopdrinking. If I needed to check out from my family and go sit in the lobby to do it I did!..* I ate a shit ton. Whatevs!..Anyway thanks to everyone who posted or commented this week - you all helped me out immeasurably. I was really concerned about this week since I've struggled (and failed) to stay sober on family vacations in the past. This has been one of my hardest annual struggles and as it says on the tin - Achievement Unlocked!..Gonna go get my coffee and watch the sunrise in a bit. Happy Saturday morning to all of you!

Awesome congrats man!! Travel will be a big hurdle for me (like one of the first times I tried to quit smoking years ago and told myself "it doesn't count if you're outside the United States...." Yeah.) ..Anyway I am inspired by your success. I'm going to London this fall for work and I will NOT have a pint at every opportunity!
Congrats on a great vacation post /u/cake_or_radish -- it sure beats the hell out of those sad and tragic vacation relapse posts.  Achievement definitely unlocked--and you woke up this morning SOBER!
I gotta do some running. It's basically like bamboo torture to me.
Awesome! That's not just an Achivement unlocked that's a Level Up! I'm sure it was harder because you were on Vacation. Well done :)
I'm on my last day of vacation as well sadly. Survived a wedding.Et al.
You kick ass!  Great job c_or_r!
