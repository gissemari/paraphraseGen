So over all I am doing good this year. I have about 50 days sober so far this year. Only 119 last year and none before that for 20 years or so...Anyways another reason I am doing this occurred to me today. .On my way to work this morning I had two cop cars pass me. A few months ago this would have made me paranoid. Because I would most likely still be drunk from the night before. All though it would have been very unlikely that I would have even been out of bed and driving at 7am a few months ago...Everytime I relapse it gets a little easier to sober up again. Luckily lately when I do end up drinking it hasn't become abhorrent. I even see the sober days I already had this year positively affecting me now...
