Yet still we choose not to drink. It might just be me but it all comes down to the wording and believing it. It's not that I'm not 'allowed' to drink. It's that I choose not to. It's that I recognize a bad day as a bad day - nothing more. It's not a reason to drink and - more importantly - drinking wouldn't help anything...Not trying to talk myself out of anything.. It just sorta hit me how much drinking is truly not a solution. At best I'd buy myself 2-3 hours of forgetting my problems. Problems mind you that would then be even worse in the morning...Shitty day but I'm not drinking. There are ups and downs. If anyone is struggling tonight there's not a false word written up above. I'm going to keep making the decision not to drink. Hope you'll join me.
