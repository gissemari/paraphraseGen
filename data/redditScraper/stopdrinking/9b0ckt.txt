One of the things I've noticed when getting sober again is that this time I'm starting to love mornings? .People that know me also know that I despise mornings and pretty much any time before noon. Of course they don't know it's mostly due to my alcohol abuse issues. .But since I've been trying to get sober again lately I noticed that I suddenly like getting up in the morning and even actually be FUNCTIONAL when usually I would be struggling and zombie-like before the worst of my hangover had passed. .Each day I have about 4 extra hours to do stuff and I feel pretty great about that! .IWNDWYT

I am a total morning person! I start work around 4:30 am. Most people think it's insanity but quiet mornings are what makes me happy haha.
Congratulations! I definitely noticed that too. I also noticed my weekends got a lot longer when I wasn't spending most of them drunk or hungover. ..After awhile for me all the extra time would sometimes feel difficult. I realized I used to drink when I was bored and turns out I was bored a LOT. I started doing a lot more things like painting and running and reading in order to fill that empty time with things that made me feel good. And of course reading /stopdrinking.  :) 
Hmm... I hope I catch the morning bug someday too. I don't wake up hung over anymore but I still feel like crap every morning and the feeling of longer days kind of just stresses me out. ..It's good to hear that this isn't the case for everyone and I hope after some time adjusting I will feel the same way! Thanks for sharing!
