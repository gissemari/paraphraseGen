Drinking made me into the worst version of myself. I was lazy deceitful slothful and just overall a slug. When I got sober I found that even though I was not drinking all my old behaviors were still there. From 2007-2010 I struggled to stay sober spending most of that time drunk and regretting every time. I spent a lot of time thinking about my relapses. Each and every one was a conscious action. I made a plan and I executed the plan. What I did notice was that well before I actually took the drink my old behaviors crept back in. Lying was a big catalyst for me. ..Sobriety for me has been about change. The primary method I use to stay sober is active participation in Alcoholics Anonymous and the three main tools AA has given me are:..**Gratitude**...**Fellowship**...And the one I will talk about today **Service**...When I drank I was extremely good at making plans. I was just horrible at keeping them. I always had a  valid  excuse but essentially I was a ghost. A big part of my sobriety has been about taking service commitments and then actually doing them rather than just saying I was going to do them. Service for me began with about two months sober. I attended a business meeting of the AA group that I went to and all I did was ask about a picnic that the group typically hosted for Memorial Day. By the end of the meeting I was chairing the thing. That was my first experience with being  voluntold  for service. It was the best possible thing for me. It got me out of head. It gave a REASON to talk to people. It gave me a REASON to get phone numbers. It gave me a REASON to go to meetings. Service has the added benefit of making me do things even when I am lazy...Not all service is that dramatic. I have made (and make) a ton of coffee. I chair meetings regularly. I greet people (stand at the door and say hello). I bring a meeting into a treatment center once a month. In the past I have spoken at many many different places (jails detox centers and just regular meetings). Service gets me out of myself and into a service mindset...The idea of doing something for others with no tangible reward is completely foreign to me. I had a phase where I bragged about service a lot probably too much. Now I just do it and don't broadcast it. If I am doing it specifically for accolades my motives are wrong. I do it because it helps me stay sober and because it helps other people to stay sober as well. The order of that is purposeful my sobriety comes first always. If I am not sober how can I live let alone help other people?..Another cool benefit of service is something I heard my buddy Tony talk about early on.  The fun people are in service.  When I get out of myself and take action I come into contact with other like-minded people and develop real friendships. People that are actively doing something for their sobriety are also in my experience a lot more fun to be around...What it all boils down to is I can't think my way into being the person I want to be I can only act my way there. ACTION is the key...That is all I got. Happy Tuesday!.

Great post many thanks for the ideas.
Great post love this series!  Thanks!
This is great. Thanks for this.
Too much thinking not enough doing...That's my issue right there...But I'm changing. I'm starting to do more and think less (at least I think I am)...
This is so good.  I really need to get involved in service work of some kind.  I am attending a Master Community Gardener program and we are required to give back 30 hours of service work to the community at the end of the program.  I think I'll start there and then see what I can do once that has finished.  I definitely need to make more change in my life so I don't just fight off the potential for a relapse.
Thanks for a thoughtful post. Chairing meetings does help keep me sane. At the very least I'd rather wait to drink until I've chaired all the meetings I signed up for so I can help myself out by keeping my name on the calendar at all times. ;)..While service is action it's worth noting that an attitude of service can enhance different parts of life. I teach college students; this semester I have a very small class. I can either "make it" through each day doing the bare minimum to have my class function (and believe me I have frequently) or I can serve my students by paying attention to their strengths weaknesses and adjusting the course accordingly because they are bright people who deserve a compassionate guide. The latter way makes for a better work week and sense of self. The latter way was IMPOSSIBLE when I was drinking.
Bravo!
I love this! I'm finding lately that the best way to turn my shitty day around is to reach my hand out to others. I tend to struggle around 4 months (I've relapsed 3 or 4 times at 4 months) so I'm really focusing on helping other people these days. It really works to get my head in the right place.
Great post... lots to think about thank you!
Also love this series. Thank you!
Thanks for the post!   I don't go to AA but my family is involved in our church and service is always available.  It is good for the soul.
