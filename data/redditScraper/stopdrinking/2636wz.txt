Just wanted to put that out there as a PSA of sorts. I saw both of these drugs listed in a recent NPR article (http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/05/13/312152578/meds-can-help-problem-drinkers-but-many-doctors-dont-know-that). I went to my doctor a few weeks ago and told her I wanted to make a lifestyle change and stop drinking. I was totally unaware these prescriptions even existed. I was drinking roughly 12 beers a day or 1.5 pints of vodka. The campral I take 2 pills x 3 a day and the Naltrexone I take once a day. The campral helped majorly with anxiety sleeping and some of the other nasty side effects I'd experience when trying to quit in the past. The Naltrexone blocks your desire to drink over time. I've had a few lapses and quit taking my meds at one point but went back to my Doc 9 days ago and started taking them religiously again and I've been 9 days sober. These of course work best with a willingness and decision to quit drinking and support groups. If I could just reach one person struggling with drinking with this information I thought it would be a great help. Don't be afraid to ask your doctor about these medications.

Best of luck just make sure you're honest with your doctors...Has anyone here had luck with Campral? It scares me being a GABA agonist and all (and a few studies say it doesn't work)
Naltrexone worked a treat for me Campral drove me nuts.
