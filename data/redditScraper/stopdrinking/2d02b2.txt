Tonight I'm going to take my family to dinner and a drive in movie instead of stumble in to my house at 8am tomorrow morning still drunk and looking to sleep all day. I've gotten to as many as 112 days but I've struggled with the thought of quitting forever. I think I'm finally ready. Of course I'll only worry about today. I know I can hit that pillow sober tonight. ..I'm sorry for posting drunk here on Monday night under another username. That will not happen again. August West is ready for a new start.....Thanks for all the support /r/stopdrinking!!!

Good update friend I'm so glad you're doing better.  
Glad to hear your doing well. Stay strong and stay grounded. 
While we don't encourage drunk posting you do get something pretty cool out of it. Whenever you feel you aren't making progress even though you are still sober you can revisit that little gem to see just how far you have come.
I'll get up and fly away...  Keep fighting the good fight friend.
