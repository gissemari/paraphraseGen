I took the deaths of David Bowie and especially Alan Rickman really hard. I thought to myself "How the hell can January get any worse". Then yesterday I found out how. I lost my telecommute contracting job I've had since February last year. Now normally losing a job doesn't send me spiraling in to a vicious web of despair. But I did so because I'm in a country halfway across the world from my home and I have no idea how to get back home before my visa expires in May. My initial thoughts upon receiving that dreaded termination email was to relapse on any and all of my deleterious vices. Smoking cutting drinking using. Why? Because I know those have worked in the past. My fiance here is trying to keep me strong saying there's nothing I could have done etc...My biggest issue is getting a US based job while I'm in Australia. I'm not on a work visa so I can't get an Australian job. I hate feeling this lost.
