It's become very very clear that my emotions change drastically whether I'm drinking or not...When I'm drinking I am mostly angry. And really hard on myself about all my failures in life. And think terrible things about my ex-girlfriend and then feel really sad about my ex-girlfriend. Also I am overly emotional about everything via text to everyone who will listen...When I'm NOT drinking I'm at least on the verge of some joy most of the time. There's a lot of sadness still though. And a LOT of anxiety (ABOUT my anxiety self-closing circle that one is). I'm trying to figure what it is I need to do to get my anxiety under control and enjoy things more. ..I've already been enjoying things more though. Just after 4 days. This isn't my first stab at sobriety though. I know it can get good and it gets easier. I had 133 days up until last March. And then some longish periods stabbed with some relapses. Each relapse has gotten shorter and shorter and each time less negative things happen. So I mean that must be some type of progress. ..I had a fantastic sober weekend spent mostly with a newish friend I've made. She's great and we went to the beach and took a long walk around our neighborhood and it was all sober. Just on Wednesday I had had my last drink was on my way back out and my mood that night was terrible. And Thursday my guts hurt and I couldn't eat much. But today I'm ravenous and feeling great physically...Alcohol is poison to my body and mind. Wish I'd tried to fix it sooner but I've still got a lot of life to live and I'm happy with my progress. Now to figure out how to not dwell on old shit...

It is progress! The old shit jumps up and bites me as well. Sounds like you had a great weekend though! Keep on truckin'. :)
For me anxiety was about stuffing a lot of emotions throughout my life. I had to experience emotions to reduce my anxiety. Counselling helped and leaning on my supports helped. The good news is that being sober we actually feel our feelings! I'm really appreciative of this post and your ability to reflect on your emotional experience. A lot of us struggle with this that's for sure!
