Badge reset this morning. ..I'm feeling really good right now physically and I hope I stay that way. I've not had bad withdrawls in many years (I successfully cut back after one incident) but I'm a little nervous about an unmissable international flight I have in six days (at least it would be *horrible* to miss it). I figure if I'm ok until then I'll probably be in the clear. I know you're not my doctors but what do you think? I've tapered off like this before with no symptoms aside from insomnia for a few days. I feel like I'll be ok and if this time it's different I guess I'll go to the emergency room. I'll use my judgement. Just so long as I don't drink...Mentally I'm using the anticipation of this trip to fuel my resilience (thank you dopamine). Taking long sober "vacations" has worked well for me in the past so I'll try that again. Being away from my unhappy life relaxing and seeing interesting things agrees with me. I've been working through some programs (not directly ethanol related but useful nonetheless) and I think I might have the rough outline of a future worked out for the first time in my life. That's the main thing that has me hoping sobriety will stick this time. My relapses are always "why not" centered now I have a tentative answer to that question. At least in my good moments...Anyway wish me luck! I'll be checking in throughout the next week at least...Stay sharp SD...

Best of luck! You're doing amazingly well :)
It took more than "luck" for me to stay sober. Having a support system--therapist rehab outpatient AA worked.
Hey you've got this! :)
