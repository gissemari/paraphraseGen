https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZVWIELHQQY..It is Craig Ferguson speaking about his struggles.  I spoke some months ago about a relapse that I had that continued until this last Saturday.  I would've had 622 days today had I not done that.  The hope is never lost it's just masked in self-doubt.  Everyone can do it today if you reach for help rather than a bottle.  Believe in your strength even though you don't think you have it.  I was just out there; it's not worth it. .."Certain types of people can't drink.  I'm one of them."..Keep your heads up friends.
