This past year has been tough with losing my job(layoff) and struggling to figure out what to do with myself.  I half-heartedly tried to start half a dozen new careers eventually losing all interest in each one after the other.  I've somehow managed to do okay financially due to thankfully saving well the previous year and taking some horrible temporary jobs here and there.  But alcohol-wise and mental health wise I went down a quick spiral.  I've had way too much time on my hands to drink and contemplate what I have and have not done with my life up until this point(I'm 32).  My boyfriend brews and has quite the bar setup and all that easy access eventually progressed to daily drinking and binging a couple nights a week.  It just kept getting worse and worse my boyfriend was finally starting to hint that I was causing issues between us and I was having to skip out on family events due to being too hung over the night before or too drunk from drinking all day alone.  All the while I was getting more and more depressed I attempted to keep a happy face and to stay as positive as I could on the outside.  I definitely did an okay job of it and I don't think anyone really knew how badly I was feeling. Then the night of the december 27th I got drunk and broke down and told my boyfriend exactly how I was feeling:  incredibly depressed hating myself and what I've become and thinking I have a problem with alcohol and need help through something like AA or a counselor.  He was really supportive in his own way.  His mother is an alcoholic and was horrible to him growing up so in his eyes I'm really not that bad and am not an alcoholic but he wants to support me in whatever I think I need.  ..So we made a game plan to try to get me better.  Unfortunately I was pretty drunk and only remember parts of it.  The crazy thing is that the next morning I woke up super hung over to an email offering me a contract with my old company.  It would be enough money to get me through at least an entire year but requires me being offshore for 6 weeks.  The last few times I went offshore I was so happy to get away from bad influences and have zero access to alcohol.  It wasn't even difficult not being able to drink.  Not only does this solve my stress from worrying about money but also it'll be a wonderful forced time of recovery with no temptations.  However it takes away my chance or regularly going to AA or seeing a counselor.  And I have 2 weeks before I head to the office for some training and then a week in my old town where I have a lot of friends who are all big drinkers and will all want me to go out with them.  ..So far things have been rocky.  I had half a beer on new years eve right before midnight and nothing since but it hasn't been easy.  My depression has stayed the same and a few times i desperately wanted to drink something.  My boyfriend convinced me not to but in those moments I resented him so much for it.  Those emotions reminded me why I feel I need some other support network.  I don't want this to ruin our relationship but right now I have no one else to talk to about all this.  I've done a bangup job the last few years to push everyone close to me but him away.  ..So my hopeful solution to this...I found an online counselor and am posting here hoping to find a support network I can keep up with now and while working.  I'm still considering trying out AA while I'm on land but it's tough to really get myself to go.  My boyfriend and I half jokingly made a new years resolution of 'less alcohol more drugs'(by drugs we mean legal and healthy things like supplements multivitamins and nootropics) but now we are getting more serious about it.  I still feel pretty miserable but i feel more motivated to work on myself than I have in over a year. I am nervous about the future after this contract we are going to have some big decisions to make.  My boyfriend has a wonderful job in a place we both have family and I've got a job lined up to start later this year in a new place we know no one.  It would be a great job for me and there's work for him in that city if he wants it....we just haven't decided what to do yet.  We don't have to decide until after my offshore stint so we have kind of just been pushing it off.  I really want to go but my solution to problems in the past has always been to move and leave it all behind so I'm not sure how much of it is that and how much of it is actually wanting the job.  That'll be just another thing to figure out these next few months. ..Thanks to all that have read this and I'd appreciate any input or support you want to offer.  Cheers to a fresh start just when I needed it!

I have an online counselor too!  I find it super helpful but it took me about 3-6 months to really see some progress.  During that time I greatly reduced my drinking and then eventually quit.  Have you checked out Smart Recovery or Refuge Recovery - they both have online/phone meetings every day.   Welcome!
