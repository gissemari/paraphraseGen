I have been struggling with alcohol abuse for a long time now and in recent years I have tried making a change and I like most have stumbled more than I have succeeded. Recently I had a wonderful 8 days of sobriety I felt invincible. This was it I thought I was finally doing it. And now I am one day sober after a week long bender that included lying to my wife about my drinking drinking in the middle of the day and driving down the street to spend way too much money on booze when I shouldn't have been...My wife and I have been married for 6 months she is an amazing woman and every day I am thankful to have her. I don't want to end up ruining what I have so that I can spend night after night too drunk to remember anything. We are starting to try for our first child I don't want to be the drunk dad. I don't want my kids to think drinking is something that should be glorified. ..When I am sober I feel so much more energetic. My sex life is way better. I am better at my job and I am a better person...I will not drink today

I can relate to this in all the ways. The fact that I  was lying my husband so early into our marriage breaks my heart. All we can do is forgive ourselves and look to make tomorrow better. It will get easier. The rewards will feel better. We will be happier and have more self Worth. We can do it. IWNDWYT
good post will definitely have to contemplate this 
Sobriety is easier and more fun with a support system. AA meetings and a therapist gave me the tools I needed to build a sober happy life. ..Kudos for 1 day. I hope you have the support it takes to stay sober. I could do it on my own.
