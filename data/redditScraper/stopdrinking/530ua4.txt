Hi my friends. I know it's not 2 months or something but yesterday was big test for me so I am celebrating with my sober mind. ..First I was nervous and as my anger increased there it was. Craving for a drink...And I went to beerhouse with 4 of my friends (or better say accountances). The moment I got inside I felt that familiar feeling of hope. How I will drink one pint and automatically forget what bothered me...We ordered and there it was in front off me nice big wet glass full of greatness ;-)..As I was about to make a sip something in me woke up. NOTHING is worth doing this!!! And it was just like when I quit smoking I bought the cigarettes and the lighter and was about to do it when same part of me rebelled. ..Even being so close to fall isn't the end of the world. Keep fighting people. Don't ever lose hope. You can make it you can fight this!.."As a man was passing the elephants he suddenly stopped confused by the fact that these huge creatures were being held by only a small rope tied to their front leg. No chains no cages. It was obvious that the elephants could at anytime break away from their bonds but for some reason they did not...He saw a trainer nearby and asked why these animals just stood there and made no attempt to get away.  Well  trainer said  when they are very young and much smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and at that age it's enough to hold them. As they grow up they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away. They believe the rope can still hold them so they never try to break free. ..The man was amazed. These animals could at any time break free from their bonds but because they believed they couldn't they were stuck right where they were...Like the elephants how many of us go through life hanging onto a belief that we cannot do something simply because we failed at it once before?..Failure is part of learning; we should never give up the struggle in life."..Love..JJ

Your right. I quit smoking long ago. I just told myself cigarettes would always be there. It was my choice. Same with booze. Itll be there. Hopefully never in my body again. Good job. 
I love the elephant story! And congrats on 50 days that's great!
