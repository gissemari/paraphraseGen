Hey guys I fucked up. I've been living in a sober house for about a month now. The place is awesome and it's doing wonders for me. I've been working the program going to meetings(and taking my careless roommates with me)  got a good job and things are finally looking up. However I took a days worth of my gabenpentin and felt a slight difference. So then a couple of hours ago I grabbed the bottle and took it outside to take more. I know my roommate noticed and he snitches on everyone. I am freaking out and not sure what to do. My house manager is awesome but there's a zero tolerance with this shit. I'm not sure if I should tell him and come clean and shit. I can't get kicked out cause I'll be homeless. I know I put myself in this position but I fucked up and really need some guidance. Also  I take gabenpentin for anxiety and if you take enough it can give you an adderal-like feeling. However I know I fucked up and won't ever do it again. This sucks

I would be honest about it. Honesty is important to sobriety.
I'm praying for you! Hope it works out   
I'm so happy for you! I will not drink with you today!
