My substance of choice is heroin/opiates I'm 6 years clean and happily stable. Today I suddenly got a craving to use (I feel like if I ever relapsed it would be on Xanax or muscle relaxants which I turned to after I stopped using heroin) which is surprising because my anxiety was been very low lately and I'm happily stable and utilizing healthy coping mechanisms. I had a small jar of wine in my backpack that I was bringing to my partner to share with him and had the overwhelming urge to just chug the whole thing by myself without telling him which is a very notable red flag. I'm wondering if my addictive tendencies and destructive personality (a previous therapist confirmed these personality traits I'm not just angsty af) are telling my brain that because I've been so stable lately my subconscious wants me to spin out of control? I feel better now but I haven't had that destructive craving for maybe 2-3 years. Love to you all for working hard at your sobriety.

I don't fuck around with any substances even ones that aren't my drug of choice.  For instance I enjoyed smoking pot but it was never an issue for me.  I could do it once ever 5 years and never have the urge to touch it in between.  But since getting sober I just don't fuck with it.
