Hey everyone. Long-time lurker first time real poster. So I've tried several times to stop drinking. I don't have any crazy stories about how it's fucked everything up for me. In fact for several years now I've been a fairly functional alcoholic. I made it about a week before breaking back down and grabbing a bottle of new Amsterdam vodka to chase with some Mountain Dew. My question is this: what made you decide to actually take charge of your life? I'm not asking about the ones whose lives were destroyed by alcohol. I'm talking about the daily drinkers. You know the ones who function on a daily basis while smashing through a fifth of vodka a night. How did you beat this shit? Maybe I'm trying to do too much at once? I quit smoking about 2 weeks ago with no relapses at all but the booze wants me back bad. Any tips would be appreciated. ..Side note: Not a fan of AA because of the "religious" affiliation. If there's anything you have NOT religiously affiliated that would be taken much more seriously. ..Edit: punctuation.

What made me finally quit was the last of a long line of things I was sure I would never do and then did. The "yets" as I think of them. Never going to drink every day then I did. Never going to screw up a marriage then I did (twice). Never going to drive drunk then I did (and finally got caught). Stuff like that. The last straw was when I called off work for two days so that I wouldn't have to stop drinking long enough to go in. That was when I saw that I couldn't beat it couldn't control it no matter how I tried and admitted defeat...Support groups were instrumental to putting some sober time together. I started with SMART then moved to a usually-not-too-religious AA meeting did some Refuge Recovery found an atheist/agnostic AA meeting and was able to cobble together a method that works for me out of all that. I also saw a psychiatrist for a while.
I believe I was the functional drinker you describe-a nightly drinker who though I did get up to a fifth of bourbon and sometimes more (like a bottle of wine on top of it) some nights for the last couple years before I quit 42 days ago. Though it's a miracle I never got a DUI no jail never lost a job in-fact have had a great job for the last 6 years that I have excelled at in a highly competitive field. I don't have the same tragic "Rock bottom" stories that some other heavy drinkers have and felt judged for it by a few AA members who acted like I wasn't telling them the truth or that I didn't belong in AA because I was not like the other members who had REAL experience with "alcoholism" (an outdated word that's a favorite in AA that I don't like to use in favor of the DSM definition of Alcohol Dependence Disorder)  I hit middle-age and I was began suffering terrible hangovers anxiety and depression that held back from enjoying my life. I worried about my health and my longevity. Felt guilty that I was sometimes cloudy at work and not as productive as I could be. But for me the bottom line became the realization that at a certain point drinking became harder than quitting. I could do on and on about how the drinking lifestyle was wearing me out though I was pulling it off and making a good case for my "normalcy" in social and job situations. But it was too much of a struggle at a certain point. Though I made so many excuses about why quitting would be the most difficult thing I'd ever done I realize that I was way wrong. Drinking destructively for years was by FAR harder. 
I always believed that I was a functional alcoholic but I just got really good at the un-manageability steering in the storm. ..I am at a stage of life where I want peace. I need things to be easier manageable boring and under control. Alcohol destroys that I need peace. ..I have had more respect for people who realize they have a problem and do something about it than those that are driven by the trauma of their actions. Do know that the traumatic consequence is out there make sure to never find it. ..
I know you said no AA but I want to say that I am an atheist and AA works just fine for me. There are a ton of atheists in AA.  Being around other alcoholics in real life is what I needed to learn that life without alcohol was possible.  An AA meeting is like perusing r/stopdrinking for an hour except you meet real people instead of Internet people. If people in meetings talk about God I half listen until they're done talking. If people here on stopdrinking talk about something I'm not interested in I move on to the next thread. Take what you want and leave the rest.
Glad you're here.  Welcome!..I too was "functional" (irony for another post).  I hadn't had a DUI been arrested been to jail lost a job wife home children career social standing or finances.  So why did i quit?..I realized that *Alcohol + Me = Undesired Consequences*..While I indeed was "functional" (quietly chuckling) I was experiencing *consequences* in a few life domains:  spiritual physical emotional and relationships.  If I had continued consuming it was only a matter of time until the others were affected - Legal Marital Employment Financial and Career...The path is downward sloping and in many instances once the *slide* begins stopping before the cliff becomes nigh impossible...I decided to eliminate alcohol-associated consequences from my life...I spoke to a counselor.  She recommended meetings.  I wasn't a "fan" of AA indeed I didn't **want** to do to AA.  But I was **willing**.  ..Only you can decide "what you take seriously".  I found that when I put limits on what I was willing to do I didn't have success...Here's a great post by u/Simpsondimsum celebrating his [70 day Mark](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/5m31f2/how_i_feel_at_70_days/). ..See if you find yourself in his experience...Today I forgo just ONE drink - The First One
