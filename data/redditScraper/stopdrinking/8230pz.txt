It's because I live alone and have few friends -   And I don't want to let you think that I don't have people. But I run a successful restaurant- and I have friends - but am such a extreme introvert - I don't relate well.  I just lead well.  I well try another dry day tomorrow.  But it's hard- i read sd everyday thinking that I can be as successful as others - pray for me and my strength.

I also live alone and I don't have many friends here in town either. If I can do it you can do it. IWNDWYT.
I was so happy to get my first place on my own but then also got me in so much trouble.  Sounds a lot like me you can do it!
Introvert here!  Right here.  I used SD and I'm cruising along very comfortably into my brand new life.  The hardest part was letting go.    welcome!
