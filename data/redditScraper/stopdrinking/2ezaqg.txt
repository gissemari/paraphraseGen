2 Steps Back. This is inspired by this post by u/cake_or_radish. Thanks man! For anyone interested: http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2eyivn/relapses_may_feel_like_youre_going_in_circles_but/..I think we all use the old adage of 1 step forward 2 steps back when it comes to stuff that gets us down holds us back messes up everything we worked so hard for. And yes often that is the case. But I think to think that we are all capable of making huge strides in our sobriety. Many of us will mess up at some point and relapse. But if we understand why we do it; why we choose to relapse understand the circumstances or triggers that made us choose to drink again then I think we stand a chance. Once you understand the mistake the most important thing is to not make the same mistake twice. Thus progress is created. I'm not saying "go ahead then keep making mistakes it's totally OK because you'll relapse anyways and find a different reason." I'm simply implying that learning will make us better. Personally I try extremely hard to stay away from booze if I'm in a difficult situation. 9 out of 10 times I'm successful. I'll take a 90% success rate over drinking every single time I'm faced with adversity. But that 10% still lingers. That's what I need to figure out and that's how I know I'm making progress. Over time that 90% will turn into 100% but I'm not quite there. Bottom line: If you take 3 huge steps forward and 2 steps back you're still making progress!

This is a difficult one.  ..A lot of people spend decades thinking that they're making progress when they're really just going in circles. ..Learning from our mistakes is good.  But keep in mind that relapse is in no way required.  You never have to drink again.  Even if you want to you don't have to.  Whether you drink or not is entirely up to you.  ..You never have to take that step back.  Ever.
