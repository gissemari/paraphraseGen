You are not alone. Very few ever get sober first time. Relapse is often part of the journey. Look at a relapse as a stop along the way to sobriety. The main thing is to try and learn something from each relapse. What caused it what were your thoughts before you relapses? Have you heard of HALT hungry angry lonely or tired. Were any of these things a factor. Never give up!!
Yeah been there on both counts. Holiday mode. I went on a bender on holidays.  Stress is also a major trigger for me.  Sounds like you had both.  I'd bet exhaustion was in there too. Holidays are so much better sober the heat and the hangovers  were horrendous. By getting sober I slept better and my anxiety is less which makes coping with toddlers easier.
I discovered that I could easily **create** an alcohol problem all by myself.  However I could only **solve** an alcohol problem with support from others...Free recovery meetings made it easy to do that which previously had been impossible for me...Tried meetings?
It gets better man I'm right there with you. It starts with today and knowing you deserve to be happy...IWNDWYT
I'm right there with you. I've also hid it well and have started to tell a few friends that I want to stop which is a big step IMO to make the difference. Shame drives addiction and maladaptive coping so telling loved ones is so helpful. ..Anyway I just wanted to say you're not alone I basically could have written this post today word-for-word. It's tough. I'm glad to be here with you and IWNDWYT.
