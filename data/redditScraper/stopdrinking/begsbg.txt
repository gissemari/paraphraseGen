It shook me a bit but then I looked at myself and how far I've come these past few months even with a couple relapses and I knew I didn't want to drink. ..This is the longest I've ever been sober in seven years. Having a La Croix for three weeks...IWNDWYT

Good for you...IWNDWT
This is awesome! ..I had a similar experience recently. The bad feelings passed way quicker than I expected after I sat with them. In the past I would have come home and would have drank to forget it.
