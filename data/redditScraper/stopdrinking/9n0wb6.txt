..Hi everyone!..u/FUCKnternetexplorer's post yesterday [Progress Is Like A Spiral Staircase](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/9mw7gh/progress_is_like_a_spiral_staircase/?st=JN39GB0A&amp;sh=b45656d2) got me thinking about my own experiences in getting sober. Because as they described my own experience has not been a steady upward climb it's been like that upward spiral - forward progress followed by regression to old behaviors and thinking followed by forward progress. ..I've been hanging around SD off and on for four and a half years and I currently have 76 days of sobriety. So I don't have the definitive answer of what works in sobriety not even for me. But it's been such a different experience for me this time around and a big part of that is because I'm using what I learned from the previous times that I've gotten sober...I think that part of why the spiral back to old behavior has happened for me as part of my process is that I've been figuring out what it is about what I changed that actually works. It also shows me where I needed to change more. Like I said I still feel like I'm figuring it out and I'm human - it's an unrealistic expectation to think that life is ever gonna be steady and easy. But I can see looking back how as I learn from each attempt my spiral gets tighter...I remember when I very first started hanging around here and trying to quit drinking I focused on changing other behaviors to support my sobriety. I tried to quit drinking eat healthier and exercise quit drinking and rigidly follow a set sleeping schedule etc. One time I decided that part of what I was going to do differently was that I was going to answer every single phone call that I got because I'd been avoiding answering my phone as part of my isolating. ..Looking back I was experimenting to see what worked. I didn't know what were essential parts of getting sober and what happened as a result of establishing sobriety. I couldn't see which behaviors supported sobriety and which behaviors sobriety supported basically. Which was fair enough. I didn't know what I didn't know and that's okay. I don't have to know how to do things perfectly the first time that I do them as I've learned in therapy. ..(And now that I think about it my therapist regularly points out to me that change is non-linear and that  pain comes before progress  which I think is essentially describing that turn on the spiral back to what didn't work before there's the turn forward to what does work.) ..What I've learned in my years of trying to get sober is that first off relapse of any kind is dangerous as *fuck.* It is not something that I can flirt with. Once I fall off the wagon I fall of *hard* and it's a difficult and frightening process to get back to a place where I even *want* to try getting sober again. I lose my brain my self-control and my desire to have a better life when I am active in my addiction *even when I'm not intoxicated.* So that's my big lesson - no matter was I do I *have* to make maintaining my sobriety more important than anything else. I just can't afford not to...That's the biggest lesson but it's not the first thing that I learned. What I figured out first is that I had to give myself permission to not focus on certain areas of my life when I was getting sober because they took energy and focus away from my sobriety. I guess that there are people who might find it easier to make a bunch of changes at once but for me getting rigid about my diet and/or my exercising while I was getting sober just made me feel resentful about everything that I was doing...I didn't have any concept of what actual self-care looks like alcohol was my all-purpose fix for making myself feel better. I drank to fix how I felt physically as well as emotionally. I drank to give myself energy when I wanted to stay up and be active and/or social I drank when I felt shitty and wanted to feel good. So I was already changing a lot for myself in how I felt physically by quitting drinking. Yes not having hangovers feels good but there's reasons why I drank in spite of them. Giving myself permission to go easy on myself in other ways made it easier to stay with not drinking. ..(I suspect that lifestyle changes happen easier and more naturally as a result of continued sobriety although I don't know that I've ever been sober long enough and stable in my sobriety for that to *really* happen.)..I've learned more about the importance of getting social support with each successive sobriety attempt. I feel deeply indebted to the StopDrinking community because I first learned the importance of that and how to do it here. I have friends I'm decent at networking (when I want to be) but I don't know a lot about how to be appropriately vulnerable and ask for help. ..It is something that I've been learning through therapy. I'm slowly getting better at reaching out for support in my real world relationships and support group (AA for the win! But your mileage may vary) But it's a hard one for me and something that I suspect that I will continue to struggle with for quite some time. I know now how important it is for me to keep working on this because I can see how over and over again I got better when I got support for my sobriety and I got worse when I pulled away from my support and/or stopped being honest about how I was actually doing...I've learned that I need to keep doing what worked to get me sober even after I feel established in my sobriety and even after I've stopped thinking about drinking. Because I've learned that my old behaviors and ways of thinking are still there waiting to resurface. And I'm an alcoholic. Alcoholism is a physical addiction to alcohol. Those pathways in my nervous system are permanently there. My addiction is now a part of my brain and body...(Side note: Yes my post title is a reference to  The Downward Spiral' by Nine Inch Nails. [I beat my machine. It's a part of me. It's inside of me.](https://youtube.com/watch?v=PCxz-d7jQwU))..The only other big lesson that I've learned that I can think of is that I don't know what I don't know and that's fine. I don't have to know how to do this perfectly and I have help available to me in figuring it out if I ask for it. I can ask on here I can ask my therapist I can ask people I know I can ask random people from AA. And I never in a million years thought that I'd be saying this but I can even ask my Higher Power for help. I don't have to know everything and I can get help if I ask for it. But I have to ask...Anyway that's long enough for today. I hope that you all are well. And remember  don't give up it wants me dead. ..Ginger_Sprout Goth-Dancing Out

I stopped a month ago and it really allowed me to see that drinking is just one of several extremely unhealthy habits I deal with. Like you I try to do a lot at once to try to attach the problem. Like you this has delayed me...Last month I quit alcohol. This month I've quit online shopping. Next month I hope to quit eating so many sweets. I hope to build on my progress. By allowing myself full license to do everything not previously mentioned I hope to not overdo it.
