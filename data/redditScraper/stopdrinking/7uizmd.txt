After i had a relapse dream last night i came to the conclussion that they are actually helpful no matter how scary or defeating they feel at the time. These dreams are like a free taste of how bad I would feel if i returned to old ways...While i dont think about drinking/not drinking very often anymore i think its important to remember why i chose to be sober every once in a while and to be thankful that I am. These dreams offer me the opportunity to think about how i never want to go back to that lifestyle again...If your just starting out in your journey of sobriety just know that getting sober was one of the best choices i have ever made. Ive realized now theres so much vibrancy and color in the world when im not boozing. Thanks for letting me share and I hope everybody has a sober and wonderful day!
