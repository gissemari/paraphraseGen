Happy Good Friday...Welp I wanted to give up booze for Lent (I'm an atheist but I enjoy participating in cultural rituals) so I did. Since I posted pretty frequently throughout the process I won't repeat myself with a timeline summary. ..Here's my Takeaways:..1. I probably drank too much alcohol. I did a lot of research about alcohol alcoholism and recovery during this time. When I do return to drinking (and I do plan to drink again) I will try to moderate. I am more aware of the addictive properties of alcohol and I can't and don't plan to ignore that...2. Drinking didn't "save" me and not drinking didn't "save" me either. Six months ago I suffered the greatest heartbreak of my life to date. Diving into a bottle made an already dramatic situation even more volatile and crazy and so 4.5 months post breakup I gave up booze for Lent.  But the past 1.5 months of Lent.... haven't "fixed" me either. I'm a person who naturally likes to be in partnerships. I really struggle on my own. I'm like a plant searching for sunlight and without a partnership I wither.      Since Lent started feelings of feelings of helplessness hopelessness suicidal ideation etc. have largely subsided over the past months.  But new clearer thoughts have crept in.  I'm still 33 alone never married never pregnant and .. sober or not... I'm going to have to deal with that or accept it.  Most of my peer conglomerate are either married divorced and most have kids.  I feel like I'm stuck in the life of a kid fresh out of college- doomed to run on the hamster wheel of dating and renting an apt while others in my phase of life are able to stretch and grow and fly. It's not about keeping up with the Joneses (I probably make and have more money than almost all of my peers) it's just about developing in a direction in life. I feel stuck still. And just giving up booze and training for a half marathon isn't gonna cut it. I need something. Something is missing...3. People in their early 30s are still figuring it all out.  We don't know what the hell we're supposed to be doing. Drinking wine was good for me until it wasn't. But when I put down the wine and spent the past 6 weeks eyes-wide-open I didn't want to see. I didn't do my taxes. I didn't learn the piano. I didn't stick to my training schedule for my run. Maybe it wasn't the wine that was the root of my hiding it's something else. I don't feel depressed per se but I'm.. something. Disillusioned with life. I guess it's hard to adjust from the very real possibility of marrying the love of my life/wedding/house/kids to a completely lonely alternative. But what I'm seeing of the world is just... not beautiful. I used to see so much beauty in life and now it's like the rose colored glasses have come off and people are just - broken and struggling and kinda shitty and sometimes really awesome but mostly just ok.  With or without wine I need to figure out how to cope with all of this new perspective that I'm not excited about.  I need to remember how to connect to people.  I need to care enough to do that...4. I'm still not a morning person. I thought I'd be up early during lent.. and I was.. for the first week or two.  Then I was suddenly exhausted and that hasn't changed the subsequent month. I went to the doc and had bloodwork done- thyroid vitamin B whatever all that stuff- all normal. I don't know why I'm so tired (allergies?) but I know I'm just tired and still wake up late in the mornings. ..5. Other people probably care about drinking more than they should. I still think it's crazy when people say "Wow you're brave"  or "I wish I could do that!" when they find out I'm not drinking for Lent. "God that's SO LONG" says my best friend who by-the-way doesn't drink at all. It really wasn't that bad.  I craved drinking almost every night but drinking wasn't really what I was craving. I was mostly craving cuddling on the couch with someone and intertwining my feet with theirs. Telling someone about my work day. Cooking while he reads me poetry. Folding his laundry. Planning our future. Now I have a great attitude about going places - anywhere - and just not drinking. It really doesn't enhance much. I evne got a text today from a good friend "We get to brunch tomorrow ! Champagne! Are you so excited!" I actually texted back a "meh."  The champagne won't make me feel good brunching with close friends and celebrating an accomplishment (in this case it's giving up booze for lent and finishing a half marathon) will. I'll still drink I"m sure and I like drinking. But a lot of the mysterious marketing hype of it is certainly diminished.  I want the hugs and "attagirls" more than I want booze. I don't even really want champagne I like wine. /shrug..I guess my bottom line here is that - I know something is missing in my life and it wasn't sobriety and it isn't wine.  Maybe it's just time to be more than "ok" being alone.  I don't want an "ok" life. I want an epic life. And I can't wait around for it to happen to me I gotta make it happen. I'm typically a cheery person I'm just in a mood tonight !..Cheers and good night. .....

Congrats on 45 days!  Regarding fatigue I was tired for at least 2 months after quitting alcohol.  My head also just recently cleared.  Other than no hangovers and the ruddy complexion fading I didn't see any improvements right away and some things were worse at first like my brain.  I haven't lost a pound of weight yet but am working on not substituting ice cream for beer.  My outlook on life is just now starting to resemble the rosiness I remember.  By not escaping my problems with alcohol I'm learning to take them head-on.  I'm also working on becoming emotionally mature.  ..All this is to encourage you to not give up on sobriety before you realize the benefits.  Wishing you the best!
