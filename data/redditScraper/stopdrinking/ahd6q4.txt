Hello one and all. I have been mainly lurking here  a while and have also been participating a little bit recently . I am an alcoholic and have also had addiction issues with other substances.  Until last week I had been sober for over a month before lapsing and going on a bender last weekend. Thankfully I have got away with it and I am again sober...Some of the other substances are as bad for me as alcohol if not even more so and I both need and desire to remain abstinent from them. I feel that one of the reasons I drank was about me struggling to deal with a specific issue I will explain. ..I have started attending a 12 step fellowship that asks for a desire to refrain from all mind altering substances.  I have previously been an AA member many years ago and had  mixed feelings about the 12 step programme.  I have kind of worked through these and have decided to just go with it. The issue is that I occasionally enjoy cannabis and LSD.  I don't perceive myself as having a problem with these substances.  I can go months without either but I'm not sure If I want to stay away from them forever...Anyway I have came to the conclusion that I'm not going to worry about it until it becomes and issue and if it does I will deal with it then. What I am going to do is focus on starting away from alcohol and other substances that I know I'm not compatible with.  Before I told myself that keeping a record of sober time was not important but I think seeing that number grow and grow will help me in future when temptation strikes.. So thank for listening to me and IWNDWYT...As an afterthought when I was applying for a badge it said I needed to press a button on the next page and would be redirected after 30 seconds.  However I was just redirected to a reddit Web page sign in screen on FF Focus. I was using the official app if that makes any difference.

I am not active in AA.  Been a couple of times.  What everyone says is Take the best and leave the rest.  I like Smart Recovery concepts and strategies much better.  The idea that I have a "disease" is insane to me.  Do cigarette smokers have a disease?  Do fat obese people have a disease?   Any addictive substance that is taken frequently enough will ultimately cause addiction.  The reasons why someone took enough to be addicted is really neither here nor there.  IWndWYT
