I haven't had a drink in about 8 months now - it's going great and I'm experiencing a lot of the positive benefits others often share. Two areas where I'm struggling a bit. ...1) By some miracle I was an extremely high performer at work while I was drinking heavily. For the most part I'm doing even better sober -- when I'm in the zone it's feels great and I'm doing the best work I've done in a while. However 1-2 days a week my brain feels foggy. I can't think clearly and I try to find things on my to-do list that I can do on autopilot. If something important comes up I try to defer it to the next day. In addition I feel disengaged on these days both at work and with my family and have don't have the energy to go to the gym. I drank daily (often heavily) for 5 years so maybe I haven't fully recovered physically yet. ...2) A couple times a month I need to do social events (dinners happy hours etc) where alcohol is involved. I'm not tempted to drink but I do feel disappointed that I can't participate. These events are usually at the end of a long day and it was such an easy release! I think one of the big challenges for me is that I'm very introverted and so alcohol helped loosen me up and get me past the social anxiety. I'm quite terrible at conversing with people I just met. Now it feels like it takes a ton of energy to make it through these events and I'm definitely not enjoying myself. This forces me into how I feel in my first point so when I leave I'm mentally use-less. Any tips to handle these situations better? I'd like to take the next step in my career and as part of that I need to be more engaging in this type of environment. Prior to the last 8 months I don't think I've ever done something like this sober so I need to learn :)

Interesting. I guess you aways assume that the foggy brain is as a result of drinking the day before but maybe it's more a human factor of having good or bad days. 
Getting good food and vitamins?  I started juicing recently and it's been interesting to see the nice changes from that.. nice energy I can see it in my skin I think I'm sleeping better.  I'm starting exercising too which is pretty nice.  I'm starting slow because that's what I need but it's helping my lower back issues already and that cheers me up.  ..If we feel blah let's do a check like we are a car taken in to the mechanic for a good once-over.  Am I healthy?  Am I grateful? Do I exercise enough?  Do I sleep well?  How are my relationships?  Do I spend too much time on the couch?  Do I have goals I'm pursuing?  Is my house clean?  Are my material possessions getting the proper care?  Am I on meds?  How are those going?  Do I need a vacation?  Stuff like that can show us if we're forgetting to pay attention to something and it's getting us down.  All my best   IWNDWYT
