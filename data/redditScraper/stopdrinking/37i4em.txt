Just starting my 3rd week sober and I'm struggling with eating and even choosing soft drinks I'm hungry and feel like eating certain things but when it comes to it I either don't feel like eating it or can't be bothered to start cooking it same with drink had some juice or milkshake and for the like of me couldn't be arsed with either. Has anyone else found this?

In my experience it takes time to recovery physically and mentally.  Many of us report weight loss in early sobriety in fact when I first got sober I thought I had found the magic diet pill: abstinence.  Almost always give it a few weeks and this turns around it did for me.  My suggestion see a doctor and be honest about your alcohol abuse history.  Good luck.
You must be drinking plenty of beverages otherwise you'd be dead.   You will get hungry before you die of malnutrition so I wouldn't worry about the food too much. It'll work itself out soon enough. 
Fueling right was and is an important part of my recovery. I eat roughly to plan regardless of whether or not I feel like it and make sure I'm getting good nutrition. 
I'm like this too. I've lost a ton of weight that I had gained because when I was drinking I couldn't control my eating. I drink a ton of juice now. What I did find is that a sweet tooth I hadn't had in over a decade crept up.
