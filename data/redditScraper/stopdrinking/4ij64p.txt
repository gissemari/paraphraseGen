I started seriously trying to get sober in 2013 when I found out my kidneys were starting to fail. I was 23 at the time 6'2" and 135 lbs. I was barely there. I decided I didn't want to die so young. First time I had 2 months then relapsed. Second time I went 7 months before I relapsed again. Now I'm at a year and going strong. I remember feeling ashamed requesting a badge reset here every week but here's the thing most people don't get it on their first try. I remember thinking after I failed the second time how hopeless my situation was that I couldn't do it but *we can do it as long as we keep trying*. I've put on 30 lbs since I've quit and am finally at a healthy weight I have a confident mind and spirit (heck I even quit smoking!). Thank you all for being there for me through this!
