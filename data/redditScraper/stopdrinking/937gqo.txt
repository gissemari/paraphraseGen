Three years ago I was charged with a DUI. I didn't get sober immediately after but that event jump started a change in the way that I looked at alcohol. For the first time (in my eyes at the time) it had really impacted my life in a negative way. Of course leading up until that point there were an unending number of ways that my alcohol usage was impacting me I was just somehow blind to them or chalked them up to necessary evils that came with being a fun-loving partying type. ..Two years ago I started trying to get sober in earnest. There had been flirtations before that but nothing that stuck. I managed to carve out 5 months of sobriety before relapsing. For that next year I would continually try to remain sober and relapse. Sometimes after one day. Sometimes a week. Sometimes a few weeks. I probably relapsed 12-15 times in a one-year span. ..One year (and one day) ago I quit for good. There wasn't any kind of special event. I had gone camping one weekend and drank heavily with friends. I had relapsed again after 3 weeks without drinking. The next weekend I went to a baby shower (more like a baby party) with a giant tub of free beer and helped myself to 5-6 of them. I got home and immediately had plans to go out and get a 12-pack...because once I started it always pretty much continued until I went to bed. Somehow I convinced myself not to. I was disappointed that I had broken yet another good start to sobriety and decided to start anew. ..Before quitting I was:..-Very Overweight.-Extremely depressed.-Dealing with heavy social anxiety.-Having Panic Attacks.-Had a poor work ethic.-Hadn't dated for 5 years.-Had a poor living situation..Many of those things I attributed to things other than alcohol when I was drinking but all of them have vastly improved since I quit. I've lost over 30 pounds. I'm still overweight but its shedding slowly. My depression and anxiety are seemingly gone or at least down to "normal" person levels. My social anxiety is much better because I have confidence going to events and being in conversations and not sounding like a drunken idiot. My business has doubled its revenue this year and I managed to move into a very nice apartment solo and am now planning on saving up to buy my own place in the future. I also met a great girl and have been with her for 4 months...If you're struggling I've been there. There are just a couple of main points I want to drive home to people that are considering sobriety or are in the early stages of it:..**-Don't assume many relapses means you will never get sober.** In total I probably relapsed 20+ times before this latest stint. I may again some day although I hope not. If you're sitting on your 15th attempt and feeling hopeless just know that when you truly make it a priority you can make it happen. ..**-If you are suffering from depression and anxiety there is a good chance it is caused by alcohol usage.** Seems like common sense but I wish someone had just told me this in a straight-forward way. I always managed to find ways around attributing it to the real cause. Now some people will always have these problems with or without drinking but if you have these issues and drink heavily it is at the very least making it worse. Give sobriety time to let your brain chemistry settle and that is when you truly begin to reap the rewards of sobriety...**-Environment matters so much.** Most of my relapses came when I was living with my 2 drinking buddy roommates. Sobriety came much easier to me when I lived alone without the temptation around 24/7. In early sobriety I couldn't go to bars at all. Today I will occasionally and leave if it starts bothering me. Don't underestimate environment. You are who you hang around...Thank you everyone at /r/stopdrinking. I don't contribute as much as I would like but this place was the driving force behind me trying to become and staying sober. You guys are the best.
