Looks like badgebot is struggling just now maybe they're getting ready for thanksgiving? We are loooking into it. Please continue to submit badge requests we'll action them and reply to you however there may be a delay before the badges appear or update for you...Thanks for your patience! In the meanwhile I can offer you [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t_PDU5RmBw) [a giant badge](http://i.imgur.com/U38NEfc.gif) OR [this cat pic](http://i.imgur.com/5pJlD5U.png) - just pick ONE to click on and make it count! :) Which one did you pick and why?..---.**Edit: Badgebot is back in business!

I choose the star. Because I like [stars.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhxF9Qg5mOU)..Thanks for the update!..This downtime is a perfect opportunity to [join the Superstars club!](http://sd.bot.nu/survey/2014/superstars)
I clicked the cat pic and I have no regrets.
Giant badge! I like big things. :P
Badge. Then cat because I ~~can't~~don't follow directions.
I'll do my part in keeping the requests down by not relapsing for a few days.
I chose the giant badge because I want one for my phone wallpaper. It'll be good to have on me this Thanksgiving to remind me why I'm doing this. Thank you!
I just want to take this opportunity to thank the mods and the badge-setter/-resetters for the wonderful work they do...You're all amazing.
