...on two things...First I binge-watched a bunch of Flaked on Netflix. Through Googling I found out that Will Arnett is not only a recovering alcoholic who relapsed after 15 years during the filming of Flaked he's also Canadian!..Second I binged on a book. I flipped over to SD between episodes and saw the book "This Naked Mind" mentioned for the 11-thousandth time so I figured I should check it out. Between yesterday afternoon and this morning I finished reading the book on my iPad...Two different mediums on similar topics. I recommend both. This Naked Mind was eye opening. My biggest takeaway:..* It's not  the people who have the problem with alcohol it's alcohol that's the problem. .* Once you accept it's the alcohol is the problem that is shrouded with marketing you realize there's no problem with you. If the social situation where people drink is boring that's because it's actually boring. .* You never had this problem before you were old enough to drink..* It got me thinking about other additions like my addiction to caffeine. ..Definitely a book worth keeping on the virtual shelf and revisiting from time to time.

I too looked up a little on Arnett after I finished the second season and never knew he was an alcoholic until then. A really great show I hope they decide to do a season three!
I'm living in Venice for the summer and have loved recognizing everything in the neighborhood.  Great show too.  I'm sad to hear that he relapsed during filming...man!
