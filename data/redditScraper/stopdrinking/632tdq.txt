I have been struggling to connect with people since starting (and restarting) this journey a year ago and have been mostly isolating myself in order to remain sober. The past couple of weeks I have been forcing myself to go places and join groups. I have been going to Unitarian Universalist church for years on and off and decided to go today. I was invited to an unofficial young adults brunch and made an awesome new friend! We have a ton in common and we made plans to go hiking next Saturday and to yoga sometime this week! As a drunk I could rarely make it to the 11:15 service and when I did I was unaccustomed connecting with anyone without a solid buzz on. I feel like I was able to reconnect who I am with who I want to be during my isolation period. I can now be receptive to people I WANT to surround myself with and not just make due with whoever will drink with me. I have found in the past couple of weeks its been easier for me to talk to people than it was when I drank like something clicked on in my brain. If you are just starting out in sobriety just know that it does get better! You need the loneliness confusion and anger for your metamorphism into your sober social butterfly self. This subreddit is literally a lifesaver and I cannot being to express how grateful I am to you all <3
