I would like to point out im over 1000 days sober I am 27. I used to drink daily from sun up to sun down. I would wake up terrified confused feeling like I was gasping for air. thats not even from trying to quit but just from my BAC getting too low in my sleep. I had a bottle under my bed at ALL times. Sometimes reaching about 1.4 liters of liquor a day. Id also say that I am in good health today and raising my daughter. Sense then I only had a small struggle with kratom that I now only use in moderation (not recommended for addictive personalities) Now to my point on how to help the men out (especially if your single) there who may feel alone stuck or without friends and not progressing..I feel like theres a notion that it will get better in time thats partly true when it comes to cravings and emotional distress. But if you just dont feel you have the energy motivation and drive to progress in other areas in life. Im sure you heard it a million times "get a hobby go out meet friends start working out just do it" chances are you dont even have the energy confidence or feel much desire to do that. Here is some things that have worked wonders for me this is my own opinions and if your going to laugh or disrespect it just stop reading now. Keep in mind I am non religious and not a member of AA (not that there would be anything wrong with that)..Most importantly quit the self pleasures and unproductive time wasters which involves no one but your self. This includes pornography masturbation as the most important things to completely quit. I believe it drains your energy and motivation even if you only do it sometimes before bed where you wouldnt be doing anything productive anyway it still drains you of energy motivation and confidence the next couple days. If your body is getting sexual release and stimulation every night your mind and body thinks it is "mating" so naturally your brain is telling you there is no need to talk to any women. remember that we are mammals and its part of biology. The sexual need and desire is an important part of our drive. So quit wasting it...Doing this alone you will find your self with much more energy. Now put it to good use start working out I actually want to work out when I abstain. You will find your self with a lot more "push" to interact with women. Doesnt mean you will be the ladies man all of a sudden but you will find your self with an actual drive to learn and take risks...Being able to abstain is hard enough dont try to quit everything at once. Do this first. But you could also try cold showers for an extra push. (completely cold no warm!) this will allow you to conquer your fear of not wanting to do something cause its uncomfortable its just water it wont hurt you. You will get a rush of "This is cold!!!" And gasp for air stay in for as long as you can. When you get out you will feel amazing and energized ready to take on anything. ..After a while of going through these guidelines I for once felt I had a want and a need to improve. I no longer felt like I just didnt have the energy or didnt care. It made me realize smoking cigs is so pointless I hated the mental addiction more then anything because its another time waster that distracts me it lowers stress! Which when your trying to improve you need stress for motivation! You can find relief in dealing with the situations or by working out this lowers stress but in a healthy way that doesnt help you to just forget about it..I managed to quit smoking with only two slip ups. No way I would have bothered quitting if I had my same old bad habits of pornography and playing video games. Not going to lie it was not easy I had terrible insomnia and went through a depression for a couple weeks but it was very much worth it...I first quit drinking stopped my life from going in a downward spiral out of control. But I never felt like I was progressing and growing just learning how to live and not actually ever taking off and progressing like I wanted. With these guidlines I am now finally doing just that. I urge you if your a single man in sobriety feeling stuck look into it giving it a try is a start. But being dedicated and following through for at least a month will change your life. I urge you to check out subreddits about nofap cold showers and working out. ..No special words or wisdom is going to get you off your butt challenge your self and I can say I tried everything to improve supplements ginsing nootropics motivation tools making friends and trying to force myself to just do it. Never worked until I was dedicated to quitting the following above

Hey man thank you for the words. It's always encouraging to hear success stories. ..One thing I wanted to caution you on is the tone you take midway through. Your claims about your body 'thinking it's mating' are entirely unfounded biologically. Also any claims about a physiological drain on energy need to be substantiated which I'm relatively sure you have no data to do. So please don't sell ideas that worked for you as wider truths. If that's what helped you like great please let people know about it so they can evaluate for themselves; just let us know in a way that it's clear that you're talking about yourself. ..Edit: the case is that for you time alone was draining. For many people myself included having things to do by myself helps me recover. I spend most of my day around people in various professional and social environments. Having time to myself to play video games or "other pleasurable activities" is very restful for me. The times I've relapsed have almost entirely been the times I haven't worked to find time and space for myself. .
