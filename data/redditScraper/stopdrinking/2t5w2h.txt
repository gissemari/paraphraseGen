Good morning fellow sobernauts!..Here we are again - Hump DAAAAYYYYY! ([In case you missed it last week...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a18xWp0cLHg))..Here in WuW we all share our struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations. It's a place to check in see how our /sd buds are doing and support each other in our sobriety...**Triumph**: I'm peeking around the corner at 6 months. Half a year. 50% of a revolution around the sun. This is amazeballs. But bigger triumph: I've started being more open about this struggle and sharing more with my friends about my drinking. I did it all in secret so this is a really huge thing for me and it feels great to be able to share my successes with the people I care about. ..**Struggle**: I'm struggling with how to keep my sobriety and its incredible importance in the forefront of my mind. Deep down I know it's one of the most important things about me; it defines me in ways most people will never  understand no matter how much they know about my backstory. I know that /sd is and will be a huge help for me with this and I'm so thankful for that. ..**General Chat**: I'm noticing huge improvements in my hair skin and nails with sobriety. The WINS just keep on coming. Yay sobriety!..Alright guys - it's all you! How are you going to spend this sober hump day? 
----------immediate responses--------

YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Day 27 checking ern
You're an inspiration at 177 days. And I definitely appreciate the two-sided analysis. I wish you all the best with your sobriety /u/cake_or_radish. Oh and I hope it's cool that I'm copying your format.....**Triumph:** I'm coming up on four days. It's literally the only thing I have going right now so hey at least there's that. My record is seven...**Struggle:** While sober I find myself dealing with a ton of antisocial behavior. I know I would be unpleasant to be around right now so I make an effort to isolate myself. I've moved in with my mom at 26 to sober up and move forward with my life. This feels enormously humiliating especially without a good job and with two unused college degrees. And I love my family enormously but I can't seem to care enough about my future to do the right things and move forward. At times sobering up seems to have slowed the even temporary signs of progress... but I know this is the right move for the long game. There's a lot of "tomorrow *this* will happen" talk and it doesn't. I just want to isolate myself during all of this. I'm not sleeping at night. I feel unjustified in giving myself any excuse for my life being such a gaping mess and yet I catch my mind attempting to do just that constantly...**General**: I'm staying sober today. That's what matters most especially coming from double digit whiskeys last Wednesday. And I really count myself lucky to have found you guys.
Well I am feeling pretty stoked: I just woke up from a solid 7.5 hour sleep and I feel more rested than I have in years! While drinking I could never sleep more than 3 or 4 hours at a time when I passed out then I would toss and turn till I had to get up. This is amazing! Who knew?!?! 
Moooorning!!!! I can't believe I'm creeping on a week. ..Triumph: I'm dropping pounds. ..Challenge:  an old friend wants to go out to dinner this weekend and catch up. I haven't been in a social environment yet.
**triumph**: I can't believe I've made it this far with no one forcing me. ..**struggle**: emotions. I've been drinking daily since I was 17 in order to deal with depression &amp; anxiety. Earlier into my sobriety I was experiencing emotions but now I'm just numb &amp; its almost irritating but I kinda just shrug it off...**general chat**: school started this week &amp; so far my classes seem fun. This is going to be my first sober semester so I'm interested in how that plays out...Hope everyone has a great day!
**Triumph:** I'm planning a 'boys weekend' with two of my oldest friends and I'm grateful that they are supportive of me and are happy to plan a weekend that doesn't revolve around drinking. I'm sure they will have wine with dinner which is OK with me but they won't drink to excess...**Struggle:** This stupid cold doesn't want to leave me alone...**General Chat:** I applied and interviewed to become a volunteer with the Red Cross months ago and hadn't heard anything until yesterday apparently they are still checking my references. I was starting to think I didn't make it through the police check but I'm glad the opportunity is still there.
**Triumph:** I reacted like a grown up and stepped out of my comfort zone in a situation that normally would have made me cry and retreat into my world of self hatred.  My first sponsor and I were talking and she mentioned that she thought I should work with someone else bc she didn't feel qualified to sponsor me anymore bc she hadn't gone through all of the steps herself yet with her sponsor.  So for a day and a half I worried and fretted and took it very personally and then reached out to some people listened to them and decided to get over myself and move on with my life.  I ended up calling a woman I met at one of my first meetings and asking her to lunch.  We met up had an AMAZING time and she is now my sponsor.  We are less than a week in and it feels so right it is crazy.  For many reasons this was a huge step for me...**Struggle:** Weight.  I was steadily losing weight while drinking and now haven't lose a damn ounce since September.  Every time I read a post on here about weight loss I get stabby and want to cry.  But I just need to get back to tracking and exercising and I am sure I will see some positive results. I just can't help but be pissy that the weight isn't falling off since I am no longer drowning in alcohol.  Bah...**General:**  I need/want a makeover.  I have had my hair in a ponytail for like 6 months and I love makeup and apply it pretty well but I think bc my skin has changed so much since quitting drinking that I need a new color palette.  So maybe I will go spend some drinking money on that this weekend.  
**Triumph:** I visited most of my immediate family. 1st time i have seen them since I got sober. My dad was so proud to have 4 or his 6 sons there. I was asked to run wrestling practice at my Lil bro's HS. I coached my youngest brother over the weekend. [The 1st time all the wrestling brothers we together.](http://i.imgur.com/kLQ3o6a.jpg) All sober with little/no temptation.    .**struggle:** there is a slight chance my SO may move so I have found myself shutting down. It probably wont happen but in the past I have messed stuff up off of the potential of losing it. I'm powerless and need to trust my creator will take care of me.    .**General Chat:** IDK what I'm going to do now that football season is over. I want to learn something I have never done before. 
**Triumph** I was brave last week and shared that I was in recovery to my classmates...**Struggle** Dealing with all the feelings of "Will I fit in will i be treated differently will i make friends" etc etc...**General chat** My hamster ate through a wall and spent the afternoon in the walls.
I'm so happy for you Cakes!  6 months is really awesome!  If you have anything big going on anytime soon I'm sure you'll kill it!..**Triumph**: I spent the weekend at a tennis tournament.  I was about 4 hours from home with a bunch of dudes from my team.  There was drinking shots laughing and lots of typical male bonding.  This was the first time that I've been in this situation where a couple days after I thought "Wow!  Being a non-drinker was a complete non-issue."  I didn't have to psych myself up not to drink or be around other drinkers.  I wasn't concerned at all about pressure from people (nor did I get **any**).  Most of the time when I come home from things like this I talk with my wife about how great I feel that I didn't drink.  This time we didn't even talk about it.  I completely forgot that drinking was even an issue...Note: That is not to say that I forgot that I'm an alcoholic.  There wasn't even a moment where I considered drinking.  I was quite content with my glass of water.  It just feels like in the last couple months sobriety has gotten even easier than it was before...**Struggle**: Even though I played great all weekend we ended up losing in the finals.  The other team just played so well.  So it really wasn't a struggle after all...**General Chat**: Short work weeks are fantastic!  I am so looking forward to this weekend.  You'll never guess what I have planned.....  .....  .....  ........ ^^^^tennis
**triumph**: traveled for work last week and spent a lot of time socializing in bars. Had fun made contacts almost no cravings...**struggle**: posting from a phone. Life is tough...**chat**: I lived and worked in Utah for a long time. Always thought it was weird that people would ask if I was Mormon especially because I was always holding a beer. Now that its soda the question makes a little more sense.
Day 2 checking in. Ready to go and ready to not drink today.
Triumph: I've been mostly sober this month. My sleep has improved dramatically I've discovered that things actually can and do happen before 10 AM...Struggle: I've been going overboard with caffeine and food while avoiding alcohol. I've settled down the past 2-3 days and am back to a pot of tea and a normal amount of food I've even been cooking a little and hard-boiled some breakfast eggs last night...General chat: I had my first drinking dream last night since quitting. The world was ending and I had a bottle of red wine. Didn't make me nervous and I just kind of woke up and thought eh.
hey guys! ride the hump. ..**triumph:** got through a weekend of birthday celebrations and roadtrips and old friends and family and did not drink. The people closest to me know what I'm doing and were supportive. I've also been hiking a lot more and exercising and my whole body is deliciously sore right now. ..**struggle:** I'm taking a realistic look at my finances and trying to set long-term goals rather than the knee-jerk aggressive goals I usually do (and that end up hurting me more actually). Slow steady and responsible is my new MO in many things. ..**general chat:** i don't know about the new Hobbit movie. I think it was pretty bad actually. ..
So its been 3 weeks since I woke up with a horrible hangover from drinking a bunch of beer I didn't even like and I'm feeling great. I'm sleeping like a baby. I'm losing weight without even trying. I'm getting the ball rolling on school again. I've barely had any urges either I think I was just totally ready to quit this time. Every time I start to get an urge I just think about how bad the hangovers have been. Or how much money I was wasting. Anyways thanks SD for all the support. Love you guys. 
Congrats on half a year! Thanks for being so active on this sub too. Means a lot to people like me!..**Triumph:** If there is any truth to the idea that changing habits takes 90 days then I am halfway there!  I could not feel better about things to be honest.  I'm kind of at peace for the first time in a looong time.  I think this is the first week I haven't broken down in tears at some point every single day...Oh and I got a sponsor!..**Struggle:** I don't ever get to see or hear from the person that I love (and hurt...)  And that's been hard.  Though of course totally deserved in this case :(..**General Chat:** My ankle pain is almost gone so I think I'll be able to start running again soon!
**Struggle:** I've been really out of it lately. I haven't even wanted to think about recovery or do anything related to it. Sometimes I come to this sub and like need to leave immediately. I dunno. I think my upcoming trip/vacation has really messed with me already. Truth is I have no idea if I'm going to drink on this trip or not. I've already pretty much decided that I'm going to figure it out once I get there. That's not to say I haven't come up with a plan to try and stay sober. I've looked up AA meetings I have sober activities planned like hiking I have Antabuse which I know I can take and drinking won't even be an option. I set up my roaming plan so I have internet on my phone at all times in order to post here/message people/skype with my sponsor/look up AA meetings etc. I actually do feel prepared. I just have no idea how I'm going to feel once I land. ..**Triumph:** I think last night I had a bit of a breakthrough though! I was sitting at my desk staring at the new 3 in my star and it finally hit me that I've got over 90 days. 3 months. It finally feels real. I'm actually impressed with myself. I may not be doing amazing at the moment and I know I'm not doing everything I can but I'm not drinking and that's the most important thing at the moment. I'm going to go to the AA meeting tonight that I've been avoiding and get my 3 month chip even though I don't want to. Someone should ask me tomorrow if I went. .

Triumph: picking my guitar back up after a long hiatus (I was learning the ukulele but forgot how much I love the sound of the guitar)...Struggle: My autoimmune disease has been kicking my ass this week and I want nothing more than to climb into bed and sleep until I'm out of this flare but I have kids and a business to run. I've spent the last year of my life wondering if I actually had the AI disease or if I was sick from alcohol but it seems as though I really am sick. I know six days isn't much to base it off of but I've been alcohol free in the past and reacted similarly. I'm sure alcohol wasn't helping anything but it's nice to feel as in control of my health as I possibly can without all the self doubt...General chat: does anyone love seltzer as much as I do?!
Hey everyone checking in to say I'm still sober...Triumph: Making it sober these past couple of days. Signed up for gym membership yesterday and ready to start exercising today...Struggle:  My problem has always been boredom combined with depression.  I was also sober for 6 months after going to a VA rehab.  Being around people who drink and not going to meetings really dug myself into a hole.  I hope to change that this time.
I'd normally be texting my wife with a "fancy a couple of midweek pints?" request round about now.  Not fussed though - over a month and the pangs are getting less frequent.  Onwards and upwards...
Triumph: 3 different people who have not seen me in almost 2 months commented on how great I look. I could see in their faces the sincerity and enthusiasm when they made those comments...Struggle: Spring semester started yesterday and before my first class Apple had to ship my laptop away for *gasp* 7 business days for repairs...General Chat: I need to force myself to unpack tonight. I was out of town on winter break for a month I've been back since Monday and I'm just pulling clothes out of my luggage each day. I'm also tripping on said luggage strewn about my bedroom.

Triumph: Went to my first AA meeting a few days ago!..Struggle: The anxiety and self doubting/alienating thoughts that creep into my mind...General Chat: Almost done with the book Parched &amp; excited to (hopefully!) continue reading "for fun" this semester!
Triumph: Things have been going really well. I finally went to the eye doctor (my glasses got broken during a drunken fight about 3 years ago) and should be getting new glasses in about a week! I'm flippin' blind so you can imagine how excited I am! I'm also going on vacation in a couple weeks and can't wait...Struggle: I've been having a rough time with feeling lonely/isolated. I work in customer service and find myself feeling bitter towards folks now that I've gotten sober. My irritability is improving but I guess I just want to spend a lot of time alone? I've always been a people person and genuinely enjoyed small talk and meeting new folks but things are out of whack as of lately. It's making me sad...General Chat: My sponsor brought up Alan Watts (philsopher/writer) and Ive been spending a lot of time listening to some spoken word stuff on youtube. I love it if any one is into counter culture consciousness "the big picture" I'd highly suggest checking him out.
Triumph: I slept a full 8 hours last night didn't wake up at all and was able to wake up early this morning to go running!..Struggle: I feel super broken. I'm making big changes in my life and I'm making progress that I never did when I was drinking but it's really hard. I've heard somewhere that progress in your life tends to come when you're at your lowest- that's certainly true for me...General Chat: /u/cake_or_radish - Congrats on talking more about sobriety with your friends! I really struggle with being open with others- drinking and non-drinking- and that's one of the things that's I'm working on and improving on under "Struggle" above. Way to inspire!

**Triumph:** I'm posting here for a second day in a row. That's good!..**Struggle:** I'm not motivated to do much except be a hermit and fulfill my parent responsibilities. I can't restart my career yet (still homeschooling) so I have a choppy schedule... I do read and knit and catch up on TV I missed out on (X-Files currently) but I feel like I need to do something else I just don't know what yet...**General Chat:** It looks like X-Files is going to come back just as I have gotten into watching it for the first time. It premiered right before I graduated college and I just never caught up (no "on demand" or netflix back then!). I'm really enjoying it now it is just brilliant.
What's up?!..**Triumph:** My counter rolled over past 100 a few days ago so that's been cool. I've stopped counting in my head but it's nice to come on here and see the counter telling me what's what. In the real non-internet world a triumph I had recently was going to a BBQ with people I didn't know and being social on my own terms. I socialized consciously and with intent and tried to put myself in social situations that were uncomfortable. I had a good time I made new friends and I woke up the next morning tired but NOT hungover. :)..**Struggle:** I'm drowning in obligations. This month I have three trips to take for work and typically consist of 11 hour days. They're rewarding but exhausting. I'm also applying to graduate programs and getting hung up on the personal statements. The deadline is February 1st and I'm starting to wake up every day in a panic. The last obligation is overseeing planning of a few training events. It's something I've never done before so I'm feeling very overwhelmed. It's been hard for me to stay focused on just one thing since my mind is jumping around between all my different commitments...**General Chat:** I'm still reading a lot and watching a LOT of TV shows. I've managed to keep up an almost-daily yoga routine. My new year's resolution of daily journaling has kind of fallen apart -- I have about 2 weeks without writing in the journal. I think the trick is not to do it right before bed because I usually want to just go to sleep. &gt;_&lt; Anyone who is a daily journaler have any tips?..Happy Wednesday y'all!
**Triumph:** working at sticking to my resolutions - physical activity laying off booze reading more drinking more water y'know...**Struggle:** super sore from running have to take it easy because i think i've been overdoing it running on concrete.....**General:** i just ate the most delicious chocolate bar and i think it changed my life

Triumph: I've quite drinking and lying - but not gambling; I'm being honest about that...Struggle: Gambling...General chat: I'd like to learn carpentry. 
**Struggle:** I fucked up and had to reset. I'm struggling a lot with anxiety at the moment; everything absolutely everything seems to be freaking me out now. It's like my head is full of bombs. My cheap-ass uncle left a box of really nasty supermarket-brand lager in our garage at some point and I suddenly remembered about it in a moment of stupidty. Ugh. ..**Triumph**: I'm not drinking today. Today I poured the rest out and tossed in the recycling don't want it lying around. That's about it. Things have potential to go pretty well for me family and career wise just now if I can get my shit together but it depends on that. And very slowly i'm getting processed by the community addictions people who're (hopefully) going to get me some support. But it takes them forever. And having this place is helping me try to refocus my shit brain on all the incentives not to drink. Thanks guys...**General Chat:** I also have to go to work in half an hour and teach a bunch of kids but I feel like i'm about to jump out of my skin..Hang in there my sober friends don't take that first drink it really isn't worth it!!..Edit - i'm also clearly losing my brain. It's Thursday not Wednesday. Oh well..
