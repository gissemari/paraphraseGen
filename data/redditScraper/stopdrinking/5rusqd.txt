still don't want to drink anymore but the depression is getting deeper. tried to paint for my (ex?) fianc  who has left me because of alcohol but nothing beautiful comes out. I have to get sober for myself and lear to love me but what's that worth when there's always that special part missing? it's not obssession it's true and sublime love. the damage I've done was so fckn big. I'm trying to pick up the pieces and fix things up. it only grows harder but I'll keep on trying. I will not drink today nor tomorrow even if my heart excruciates and cripples me in pain. wish you all a great day and much strength in each of your personal struggles..in case interests anyone here's the painting:.http://oi66.tinypic.com/27wuell.jpg

Great painting! Sometimes I wish that I could do this... and then I think about the other great things I can do (writing and music)...Hang in there! I don't know a lot about depression and how to get out of it some people here have more experience than me. But I know that depression can't be helped with alcohol.
That's awesome!! Keep it up!..You're still very early in your journey. Hang in there :)
