So to day is day 20. Feels pretty good. Two alcoholic decades.*..So on my previous attempts "landmark" days** were always a trigger but today I have not had any cravings. This time around I haven't had a single urge. The thought of drinking sounds awful and I think a lot of the reason has to do with how I felt the last time I got drunk (Terrible). [I posted about it a while back if you want to read it about it...](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2zrk7n/nice_to_see_that_2_again_1455/) but onto the exercise...**The Exercise: Talking to No One** (...hear me out)..On my way home today I started talking to myself...I started practicing (out loud) what I was going to tell my new doctor during my appointment next week (I'm getting a physical to see if I fucked anything up...Fingers crossed). I was having problems putting my alcoholism into words but eventually found myself using my last few relapses as an example. I started talking about exactly what happened and what I did. I even went down to what I drank where I bought it from what the cashier said. I was specific. I was completely honest (no point in lying if you are by yourself). I was honest about the good. I was honest about the bad. I was honest about small useless details. I just talked... and talked. I talked for 30 mins all the way home. I continued to talk just sitting in my parking lot and soon realized that I needed more time. I pulled back out and drove around my city for about an hour...just talking about what happened...bit by bit...piece by piece. I talked for about 1.5 hours! ..Doing this made me realize how fucked up I was... and I don't mean drunk fucked up (even though I was). I mean like mentally physically and emotionally FUCKED up.... like my thoughts and actions could have gotten my put in a psych ward and should have put me in Jail (again). I have known that I am an alcoholic for awhile but this is the first time I have really come to terms with how bad it got. If I had continued to drink they way I was during my last relapse I would have lost my job lost my friends lost my relationship with my family lost my freedom (Jail) and there is NO doubt in my mind that I would have lost my life. After this exercise my reason for not drinking has changed. If you asked me 3 hours ago I would have told you that my reason for getting sober was because I can't control myself and I it gives me anxiety the next day. Now if you ask me...Its because taking one drink would turn me crazy and eventually lead to my death. If I had continued down the path I was headed...I probably wouldn't have made it passed 25...I know what you are thinking "No shit Sherlock." I'm probably late to the game but chances are so is someone else so I figured I would share. ..*1 Alcoholic Decade = 10 Normal Drinker's Days..**Landmark Days - Any day in sobriety that is divisible by 5 7 or 10 ..PS: I went to my first AA meeting last week. It was awesome. If you are considering it GO! If you don't like it try a different meeting. You would be surprised how much they vary. Btw. I am NOT a religious person. I was surprised how many people were my age. I don't feel like such a freak anymore...Sorry for writing so much. I am just feeling good and wanted to tell someone...TL;DR : Talk to yourself **out loud** about your alcohol abuse/last relapse. Be **specific**. Be **honest**. You might discover something about your relationship with your addiction.

I think you're describing the benefit that I (and others) get from participating here on SD.  I'm forced to write my thoughts out in a directed and coherent fashion. This helps me better understand myself my reasons my motivations; it helps me to discover think through and close any loopholes that may be lurking about; it helps to remind me of where I've been and of where I'd like to be etc.  For me the fact that it's a written medium helps a ton too. Very rarely do I write anything that doesn't go through a significant editing process.  It's not so easy to edit your words once they've come out of your mouth.  Being able to see it all laid out lets me see where I may be going wrong...I know others like to journal.  Communicating in any form even if with only yourself is usually a good thing. :)..
Great coping skills! 
I'll try it today!
