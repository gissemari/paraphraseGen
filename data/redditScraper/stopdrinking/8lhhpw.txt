Yesterday I took my first exam and got 90%.  That is the best exam result of my life...Slowly I'm working towards achieving some bigger goals in my life. And to be honest?..I owe all of this to the deep sense of community spirit here. The unconditional love and support you all offer to those both making and those struggling with the good choice to abstain from alcohol is awe inspiring. So from the bottom of my heart.....THANK YOU!
