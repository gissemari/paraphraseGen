Seven days... it was the longest we'd gone in a long long time without alcohol. Now we've been bingeing for the past five. Been fighting a lot. I just want to be sober again. I'm so depressed. I wish I was inspired and felt sterling but I just feel weak. Ashamed. I want to be a normal person. I want to stop struggling with this.

Throw all the alcohol out and make today Day one. You can do this..IWNDWYT 
You're struggling because it's a struggle. For all of us. That's why we're here and I'm guessing why you're here: to find some support. Keep struggling keep fighting. You may lose another battle or another ten but you'll come out on top as long as you just don't give up. We all will.
Even sober people struggle. In our case path is little more up hill so we have to have a walking stick for support.  Right now there are 117035 walking sticks here to help you climb that hill....Have you ever watched kids learning to ride a bike? How many times they fell? But every time after initial tears they get back on it and started pedaling. ...Do you think it would be easier for you to shift "**WE**" want to stop drinking to "**I**"? ...Stay with us. You had 7 days so you can have another 7+. That sober week proved that you can do it. u/puzleboy said *Because I have a responsibility to myself* and that's what I tell myself. I am first and everybody else is second....Internet hugs and IWNDWYT!...
Start again. Getting a Day 1 was always the hardest for me. Remember that you cannot moderate. You can do this! You just did 7 days!!!
