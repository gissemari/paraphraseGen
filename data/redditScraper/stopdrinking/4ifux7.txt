It's day 35 for me today! Been a every weekend binge-drinker for ten years and for the last two years used a lots of party drugs in the weekends as well. My drug and alcohol abuse came to a point where I was drunk as an ape high in LSD+MDMA+Ketamine at the day I was supposed to apply to schools. This was a day I was looking forward the whole year and obviously I couldn't apply anywhere and my dreams were pushed another year further..This was a moment of change for me seeing how far away my actions are from my toughts. It started a process witch is at the day 35 today...My alcohol and drug abuse was self-medication for underlying depression making me numb to my own life. Confronting things has been very painful but necessary of course. And the demons are strong saying I could take just a little bit just for not feeling so lonely. But I know that for me nothing is never enough be course the drugs and alcohol are not for having fun but for keeping the misery away. Most cruel part for me is that I need to let go so many people I thought are my good friends but I have came to realize the only thing that keeps us together is alcohol and drug abuse. Hanging out with these people would eventually make me relapse...Being sober has given me enough energy to start change things that are making me miserable in my life. I quitted my job and gonna spend some of my savings going for a longer travel where I can hopefully get some perspective to my life..
