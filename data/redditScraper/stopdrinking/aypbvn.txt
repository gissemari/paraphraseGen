Thank you!
Honestly being tired makes me more inclined to drink. Not sure why. Go to bed early!
IWNDWYT!!! 
Thanks for posting this
Thanks! Heading over to my cousin's house for dinner and my birthday cake. Birthday was last week. We'll be mellow and play cards for a few hours. I haven't played cards in years! ..On a really positive note one of my good friends told me last night that he'll be giving up the weekday wine for the next five weeks and contain it to the weekends. I hope that he can go 100% sober after but it's not my place. Plus he has 2200 wine bottles in his cellar so I won't even ask. But he is trying to cut back so any small step with my help is certainly helping others.
really really want to party tonight. the weekends are getting so boring to me i'm frustrated because i know i'll regret it. big time cognitive dissonance right now.
So glad someone said this. First sober weekend has approached me. Having a real hard time not listening to the "just do it on the weekends" type nonsense. 
I nearly cried when I read this. Its just one of those days when I don't feel strong enough and I'm alone (all my friends I turn to are out at bars tonight) I just need to hold on. Thank you for believing in me.
