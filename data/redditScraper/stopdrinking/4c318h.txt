There is a recurring theme in my life of never being good enough. For my family myself my ex wife who constantly cheated. Now I'm experiencing the real loneliness for the first time ever. I've been emotionally lonely for a long time but being physically lonely is completely new. I'm madly in love with someone but I know I'm not the only one for them. In creeps that feeling of not being good enough to captivate their attention as they have mine. I struggle with wanting to feel things and experience life as it is and wanting to drink or use and feel nothing. Today I will stay sober because I'm not sure I'd make it through another relapse.

This is the sort of thing in early sobriety at least I was best off taking to an AA meeting and sharing as part of a discussion or with a sponsor.  You might also look at my post on doing "'Esteem-able' Actions" because there are certain small steps you can take in the here and now to turn this thing around for yourself.
Alcohol pretty much makes me more insecure with constant and heavy use.  This is the only way I deal with alcohol. #Constant/Heavy.   So.....I always end up insecure and needy which is very unattractive as a mate.  With sustained sobriety I become very confident which is very attractive to most people. I do realize that there is a difference between cocky and confident. :)
