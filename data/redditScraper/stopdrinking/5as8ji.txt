hey there r/stopdrinking ..just wanted to check in. It's been 4 days since my last drink and I know this isn't always suggested but it's also been 4 days since my last cigarette last bit of marijuana and last sip of caffeine. ..I'll probably end up going back to caffeine but those first few days were hell. I had to be hospitalized for a few hours for intense anxiety and dangerous levels of dehydration and I've never had to be hospitalized before. A part of it was really embarassing having to check myself into the hospital but a part of it was freeing to finally get truly honest with my family and GP about the levels of my depression and reliance on substances. ..I'm only writing this post because the worst of it is now over and I just needed to be honest. I've been going to AA but never feel like I can express my feelings as well out loud as I can in words. ..I'm 24 years old and some things I would always worry about were trying to form platonic as well as sexual relationships without the crutch of booze weed or hell even cigs for that matter. One of the hardest things for me to get over is my impatience. But after 4 days of a sheer mental roller coaster I hope this is the last time. ..Anyways I just wanted to check in and say that even though some of us may relapse it gives us (or at least it gave me) a chance to start as fresh as possible. It hurts sometimes and it's definitely not easy at first but life goes on. ..Thanks for this subreddit I'm grateful for the honesty and I'm grateful for letting people let me express myself without the social anxiety of eyes on me (not that theres anything wrong with it! It's just the way I am. I fully endorse face-to-face support). ..Happy Wednesday everyone. The struggles are what remind us of the beautiful parts of life right?

Congratulations on quitting all the things! I've recently opened my eyes to how much of a crutch caffeine is to me but it's at the bottom of my list of things to cut out to be honest. Thanks for sharing I raise my seltzer to fresh starts!
