Hello all. ..I have not been here before or posted on any subreddit so forgive me if I make a faux pas...I have had repeated attempts at remaining abstinent over 22 years had hospital detoxes and plenty of day attendance relapse prevention. 12 weeks was my best effort continuously sober...To date I have always returned to drinking when I return to work...This time around I am at 100 days and I have just picked up my first prescription of disulfiram I've never used it before it is incredibly hard to get here in the u.k...I have to return to work soon as I am not considered sick under current welfare criteria let's not get into politics though...I wondered if anyone has advice or tips to avoid pitfalls. I have the drug which is fantastic and should be enough but as it is so hard to get I must plan for shortages and I can't stay on it long. Guidance is 3 months tops...I work in construction freelance so it will be a new site new people. ..Many thanks in anticipation.

Welcome!  I am only at 24 days but am feeling pretty good. I don't know if you've read it already but the book The Naked Mind is highly recommended and can be accessed on the side bar. You have 100 days so I think you're doing great! Grab a badge and do the moring check ins. They are a tremendous tool in staying sober plus the advice and people on this sub are the best. Stay strong and I will not drink with you today.
