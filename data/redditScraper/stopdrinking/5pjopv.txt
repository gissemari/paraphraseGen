Hello all..I am a 26 year old male. Recently divorced after about 3 and a half years. Moved in with my parents after the divorce and quickly moved in with friends. These friends smoke weed constantly as well as drinking and smoking (and occasionally other drugs). I moved back in with my parents because I was becoming more self-destructive than I ever had been before. And it was bad before. ..I know I should find some sort of meeting to go to but AA terrifies me for 2 main reasons. One is that I'm not religious and I don't want to be the only atheist in a group of believers talking about how God is helping and working in their lives. The other is the finality of  stopping forever. I have had lots of terrible memories with drinking but some great ones too. Especially just going to a pub with friends and sharing laughs and interesting discussions over a few beers.  Or with smoking I love sharing a cigar with my wise grandfather at family gatherings but I also need to stop my on-again-off-agin smoking habit. I also can't help but feel that by stopping forever I am somehow letting the alcohol win. Like if I can't learn self-control then have I really improved myself at all? I struggle with overeating too and I can't stop eating. I need to learn to control it you know?..I live near a medium sized city so there are alternatives to AA like one at the Buddhist temple and another at a mental health facility where they teach moderation from a cognitive-behavioral psychology standpoint but AA is the only one that meets every day. ..What should I do?

I had to try out several different meetings and avenues of support before I found what worked for me personally.  Most AA meetings I've gone to don't overdo the God thing.
Dude I have such similar thoughts about god in AA admitting defeat to alcohol and not wanting to give up the good times that did come with alcohol...Here is what I can tell you from my experience:..1.  There are a shitload atheists in AA.  You will not be the the only one.  I am an atheist in AA.  No one will force me to believe anything...2. All you need to work AA as far as the whole god thing goes is to achieve "spiritual growth not spiritual perfection."..3. The steps are in an order for a reason.  You don't have to worry about the god steps until you get there.  ..4. If you do go to AA you will hear god related stuff that may scare you off.  Ignore those things.  No one speaks for AA as a whole.  If someone tells you the only way to get sober is through god that's not true.  I had coffee with an AA guy today who told me a speaker he recently heard at a meeting is 42 years sober and an atheist.  ..5. You can't do any harm going to meetings.  And there's nothing saying you can't go back out and drink in the future.  People do all the time.  And those in the rooms are waiting with open arms to welcome them if they decide to get sober again.  ..6. I've been listening to an audiobook about the history &amp; basic concepts of eastern religions and am considering doing some deeper research on them once the book is done.  I think that the principals of some of those religions would pair incredibly well with AA.  ..7.  I am here if you need someone to talk to.  Pm me if you want to talk more.  
First my biggest obstacle was "Forever!?"..My mind told me "you think you can not drink **Forever**?  Ha!  ...."..I realized that my mind was correct.  No mortal human has ever done *anything* FOREVER.  So I know I can't...I don't have to do it forever.  ..The world record for Sobriety is 24 hours.  Hey I can **do** 24 hours; I did that yesterday!  No problem!..In fact I realized that I'm not "not drinking" forever; I'm also not "not drinking" for the Superbowl; for St. Patrick's Day; Easter; Aunt Ethel's first cousin's daughter's first communion.... summer bar-be-ques Memorial Day; Labor Day....   etc. etc...I'm just going to forgo ONE drink - The First One Today.  That's All...The AA thing - I've found a lot of support tools resources and fellowship from people that understand what I'm experiencing.  There was no requirement for or against religion.  I've met some religious people there.  I've met agnostics there.  I've met atheists there.  ..No one has tried to convert me to anything they do or don't believe...But they sure helped me stay sober!
