*(Note: Just requested the badge change to be reset.  Damn I had a good run going.. almost 4 whole months)*..*So I went out on Dec 28 to the bar with friends. Had alcohol for the first time since September 1.  I got black-out drunk within 3 hours of being there. I don't remember a timespan of four hours; everyone said I was speaking/acting normally so it's even weirder that I can't remember anything. I swear to God I have brain damage from this. My brain doesn't react normally to alcohol at all anymore.*..*Woke up the next day in my bed with my shoes on with what probably ranks in the top 5 worst hangovers of all time. Endless vomiting constant headache hiding under my blanket all day unless I needed a puke break.  I set up a fan blowing on my face drank gatorade (even though less than half of it probably stayed down) and promised myself this would be the last time.*..*Then on New Years eve I had half a glass of wine my dad gave me because January 1 is a cooler sobriety date than December 28 :-P Easier to count too.*..*I've been sober since then and I love it. I've gone to a few 12-step meetings and hope to find one that I stick with but its hard to make friends.*..Anyway I wanted to share a list of the things that I enjoy/enjoyed about sobriety and serves as a reminder to why just being sober is so much better than getting into a drinking pattern:..**1) I enjoy sunlight.**   Gone are the days of trying to cover up my eyes and hide from it.  Even when I wasn't blatantly hungover natural sunlight always felt too overwhelming. It's such a nice feeling to go outside and look at the sky without your head hurting...**2) No chance of hangovers.** This goes with the first one; helps to enjoy the beauty of nature more.  I actually caught the flu right after I got sober but the fact I wasn't feeling like crap due to alcohol was pretty cool...**3) I can look at myself in the mirror again (from an emotional/self-worth perspective)**..**4) I can look in the mirror again (from an aesthetics perspective).** My face looks better. It's less wide/fat my skin has a better tone and my eyes look more clear (and more green!)...**5) I have more freedom.**  More time more energy more money.  More mental space to think about what I actually want to do with my time to actually set goals and know that they can happen. ..Overall life is less of a waiting game.  My mentality is no longer "Get some alcohol for tonight. Now that tonight's booked start living tomorrow".  ..Nope.  I'm living today and right this moment.  I am not putting off life anymore because I have a bottle to occupy myself...Thanks for reading!

Good luck. Be willing to do whatever it takes and you can do it.
Being sober rules. It's like levelling up in a video game. You have now reached the next level and can start to think about what else you might to do level up (new hobbies exercise diet new skills and experiences). Happy for you!
Awesome!  Thanks for sharing.
Good job getting back on the horse!
Good luck! We're rooting for you!
