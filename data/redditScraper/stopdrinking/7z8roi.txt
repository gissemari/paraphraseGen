Today marks 1095 days (3 years) since my last drink. It's an important day to me and I want to share some of my thoughts feelings and experiences surrounding my relationship with alcohol...There's a huge stigma when it comes to talking about alcohol abuse and for a long time I felt so much shame in admitting (especially to myself) that I had a problem. Alcoholism was a slow and vicious cycle for me. It started off as something fun and social and over the course of it developed into an unhealthy habit that I struggled to control...It felt good to drink so I found reasons to do it. I drank when I was happy I drank to be social-- to bond with people I drank because I was feeling bad and needed a lift but mostly I drank because I was anxious and didn't know how to process those feelings. I recognized that it was probably not a good idea but would tell myself as long as I was getting stuff done still I didn't have a problem. As my anxiety worsened I began drinking more frequently and in larger amounts. I was never addressing the root causes of my anxiety but I didn't care. Well I cared but not enough to do anything about it. As my anxiety increased I started turning into a huge asshole. It affected my relationships. I was struggling to make or keep friends. I was comparing myself to others until I became a negative angry and bitter shell of myself jealous of how everyone else seemed to have things so much easier. I had no coping skills for the emotions I was feeling and alcohol was an easy way to not feel. My emotional pain was constant. I didn't want to think about the things that were causing me to be anxious. I didn't want to feel. Unfortunately in the process of numbing the negative feelings I was also anesthetizing myself of all the moments of happiness. I was left feeling like I was someone who didn't have any value...Over time I lost all of my ambition -- I was massively depressed and did nothing but eat drink play video games and a few other activities that allowed escape from my emotions. I consumed more-and-more of anything that would make me feel temporarily better. I wasn't exercising and I gained a ton of weight and was generally unhealthy. My self-image was shattered physically and emotionally. My attitude was explosive reactive and narcissistic. I had become someone that nobody wanted to be around (even myself). I was let go from my job (unrelated to alcohol). I placed blame for my problems on anything I could never taking responsibility for my actions. I was treating my girlfriend --V-- terribly. She was such an important figure in my life but I hated myself so badly that I couldn't reciprocate the love that she was giving me. She stuck by me even though she deserved better. I was selfish. Jealous. I hurt a lot of people...I had to be honest with what I was doing. I abhorred who I was especially when I drank. I felt like shit all the time. I made terrible decisions some of which I couldn't even remember. One time I drank so much while preparing for a party I was hosting that I passed out half-an-hour in. It was embarrassing but it didn't stop me. I truly fucking hated myself. I was thinking about what my future looked like and it wasn't pretty. I had stomach pains and I was concerned about what I was doing to my liver. I was scared I was going to kill myself in the process of serving my addiction. I once read that change occurs when the pain of staying the same outweighs the pain of changing. I was ready for a change...I had my fair share of challenges when stopping. Flat out it was terrifying. It was painful. I had to deal with all of the emotions that I had been repressing for years along with guilt and shame. I've cried more in these past 3 years than ever before in my life. Drinking had made me complacent with being a coward. One of the things that got me through my early days was meditation. I would sit down and repeat over and over that  this too shall pass.  I clenched my fists and white-knuckled it. Time passed. Feelings passed. Often they passed like a fucking kidney stone but yeah they passed...I remember breaking down into a sobbing gooey mess one night after having a conversation with --V--. I remember talking about how I felt and her holding me and telling me I was worthy of being loved and that I deserved happiness. I think it was the first time I realized how badly I hated myself. This was one of the most difficult parts about becoming sober. I had to learn to be kind to myself--to see myself as more than just my perceived flaws. I couldn't go back to how I was even if it meant I had to relearn everything. I never wanted anything more badly in my life...About a year into sobriety my relationship with --V-- mutually came to an end. We were together for 12 years and it was difficult for me to deal with. My biggest fear was loneliness. And I was so fucking alone. I lost everything...Being alone It became apparent that I was codependent in our relationship. I relied on her to cultivate friendships for the both of us and I would simply latch on to what she built. I assumed we came as a package. When we ended things most of her friends left my life. I wasn't the one they were interested in forming relationships with. It was eye-opening and heart-breaking and a massive catalyst for even more change. Drinking was not an option...My biggest fear was loneliness but the thing about having it come true is that it made me reevaluate everything I thought I knew about myself. I hurt so badly but I was still breathing. And as long as I was breathing I could keep trying to make changes. I became obsessed at observing my habits and evaluating their effects. I realized that a mistake made more than once is a decision and I was tired of making bad decisions. My motto is that if I was unhappy with who I was becoming I would make changes. I survived this way. I incorporated the philosophy that I was under no obligation to be the same person 5 minutes from now. It felt great to be honest with myself about who I was. Being alone taught me some cruel lessons but it was critical that I experienced them. Nobody else was going to take care of me. Nobody else was responsible for my happiness. Most importantly nobody else could put in the work for me to become healthy. Instead of giving up I continued to trudge forward making changes and slowly I became who I am now...I've taken ownership of my choices and the consequences of my actions. Fear doesn't rule me. The shame I felt over the things I've done has been replaced with pride. Honesty self-discipline empathy and integrity have surprised me and given me a sense of personal responsibility. I've grown in ways I never even dreamed of. I've given it everything I have. It really feels like I'm a completely different person. I learned to love who I am including my alcoholism...I don't want to come off as some preachy born-again martyr and I honestly don't hate alcohol. There's usually a couple beers in my fridge chilling. I still go to bars and hang out. You do you -- drinking is just not a good fit for me...There's a part of me that hopes that by being open about my sobriety I can remove some of the stigma that prevents people who are questioning their own relationship with alcohol from seeking help. I want to inspire some of you who may be struggling with your own challenges (alcohol-related or not) and prove that it can get better if you're willing to put in the work. I want to scream at the top of my lungs that it's okay to not-be-okay. If you need help I'll be here. I'm not an expert and I'm not  cured . Whether it's day 1 or day 10000 no matter how far up the road I get the ditch is always the same distance away. It's something I've learned to live with. I'm not here to be judgemental -- I've just gone through some shit and made a lot of really painful mistakes that I don't want others to experience...You're not alone you're worthy of love and you deserve the chance to be happy....EDIT to add: ..On the first of the year I wrote down a list of my goals. It ended up being a document that was 6 pages long. LOL. At some point I started a section for my rambling philosophies and I... well.. I think it may be helpful to some of you...These are my goals for sobriety: ..* Continue to work on your sobriety. It is possible to be flawed without escaping via self-destructive activity. This has to be above everything else. **You may not set the world on fire today but don't burn out your potential.** You're fucking amazing and deserve to be happy. You've made mistakes. Don't let your ego stop you from sharing what you've learned. **Be the person you needed.** ..* Reach out if you need help. Seriously. If you're entertaining the idea of drinking because you're feeling weak lonely stressed or whatever stupid excuse you're telling yourself   reach out. You have people in your life who love you and will help you. This is true strength. Reach out...don't be a dumb ass...and these are my Ramblings:.Nobody else can create or is going to create your happiness. You don't have to be perfect but always work on being kind to yourself. Everybody makes mistakes just strive be better than yesterday. On the difficult days accept that you're doing the best you can and that you are able to make changes at any time. Be your own best friend and advocate. If you are unhappy there is nothing saying you are obligated to be the same person five minutes from now. So make changes. Don't panic when you fail. Make changes. Look for little victories and celebrate them.  Make changes. Remember that love doesn't run out. Give it freely. Including to yourself. To me love looks a lot like patience. It is your actions that determine who you are and where you take your life. There's nothing physically stopping you from doing whatever you want to do and our thoughts amount for nothing if we do not act upon them. Make room in your life to focus on the things that really matter. You don't need to care about the things that don't. Make changes. Acknowledge your privilege...You are not a victim unless you make yourself one. Remember that you are not owed anything...When you tie your identity to living up to your own standards the only person who can harm your identity is you. You don't need validation from others. Be you. If you don't like who you're becoming  make changes...No matter how bad you feel (or whatever excuse you make) time will pass and work is either going to get done or it isn't. Goals are going to be achieved or they aren't. Replace your doubt regret and anxiety/depression with taking action. Doing positive action will not always feel great but it yields positive results. Doing the work now is like paying yourself in future happiness points. Pay yourself. ..You don't need to step on people to reach your goals. Show kindness in unexpected ways. Elevate those around you. Be you. Love. .

CONGRATULATIONS!! Mine is coming up too! ..I don't hate alcohol for others but I LOVE being sober for myself!
Great share - and very inspirational - thanks for taking the time...IWNDWYT
Congratulations on your success...Your story really resonates with me -- its very similar to my own but you are 3 years farther on your journey than I am...You've given me hope for change. Thank you.
Congrats! I'm new to this journey and your story is so real and encouraging for me. Thank you for sharing this! 
Wow and congratulations. Thank you for sharing and thank you for wanting to scream  it's ok to not be ok.  I am not ok. I think I was conditioned to bite my lip and get over it from a very early age. My single mom used to say a lot  buck up lil camper you're ok you're alright you're ok stop crying.  And I clearly WASN'T OK. ..I find myself having to work back (or forward as it were) from that point and let myself just be and feel what I'm feeling. Without fearing teasing or judgement or ostracism. ..Thank you thank you thank you. I wish you the best life you can build.   
Did you use AA or any programs like that?
Wow so much in here that I relate to being similar in my life and I've had tears streaming since the half way mark...Thank you so much for your share it has meant an awful lot to me to read and given me so clarity that I was missing today...Fantastic work on your journey and I hope to be able to share my story of success of change in the future with you someday.
Thank you so much for sharing buddy beatiful stuff. I will not drink with you today!
Thank you for sharing and congrats! Posts like these are so helpful!

Awesome post!  Congrats on the new you!  .These posts continue to be so inspiring to me Thanks!
Powerful words....." I want to scream at the top of my lungs that it's okay to not-be-okay. If you need help I'll be here. I'm not an expert and I'm not  cured . Whether it's day 1 or day 10000 no matter how far up the road I get the ditch is always the same distance away. It's something I've learned to live with. I'm not here to be judgemental -- I've just gone through some shit and made a lot of really painful mistakes that I don't want others to experience."..So true thank you for your input. 
I'm stealing this: "Feelings pass like a fucking kidney stone." For some reason it resonates with me. Congrats to you!
Your words are very powerful.  I'm moved reading them and I feel the work you've done.  It's very powerful to think that you are under no obligation to be the same person 5 minutes from now.  It's an act of bravery to trudge through muck.  Thank you for this.
So powerful and honest. Thank you for sharing this. Congrats!
Well done matey - "Over time I lost all of my ambition." Hell yeah..i get this..I'm only now finally getting my head out of my arse again. Sometimes I think that if I hadn't drunk for 30 years I would have achieved so much more! I spent the last 3 months before quitting just giving up. Now I have loads of things to do and enjoy getting up to do them! Anyhoo...onward and upward!
Thank you so much for sharing this and big congrats on the 3 years! It is very motivating for me I could recognize myself in your story. There's a long road ahead for me your post shows me that it's worth it.
This is a well-written description that I can resonate with.  Congrats on the 3 years.  
Thank you for sharing and congrats on your journey so far. 
Wow reading this I literally felt like I was reading a story about my life. Today's my first day sober and I'm just glad that you could give me hope. 
 A mistake made more than once is a decision  .You're absolutely right. Thank you for this post for sharing. And congratulations on 3 years! 
Great share! thank you
I don't have a lot to add but thanks. A lot of those words could be my words now and a lot could have been in my future &lt;3
Thank you. So much of this resonates with me.  Congrats!! 
Just curious did you drink all throughout the 12 year relationship?
Thanks for sharing! Your story resonated with me too and I think sharing stories helps reduce the stigma of alcoholism. Congratulations on three years!
I almost cried reading your description of who you became from drinking. It sounds so much like I was...Thanks for sharing. I'm inspired   
2016 was a leap year so you are technically a day short buddy. I tell you what IWDWYT and you can get your 3 years. ;) Seriously congratulations. I'm on day 43. I have a long way to go.
great story rock on
Incredible.  Had chills as I read it.  I'm on another attempt at sobriety been here and disappeared before.  So much of what you said resonates with me...Thank you.  ..One of my mantras these days that is related to your way of thinking = no one is coming to save me...No one is coming to save me.  When I say it it does not feel negative - instead it cuts deep in me along your same lines - that only I am responsible for me for my happiness for my strength and ability and living a life in accordance with my inner fiber...Thank you man.  Thank you so much.
Just passed 9 months. Thanks for sharing I can connect on so many levels and reading this makes me know I have grown a lot...9 months ago I was at rock bottom after getting laid off and evicted in the same month. I went from working at a tech company to working at a gas station to stay afloat. I couldn't stop drinking or smoking weed it was how I kept myself going while like the biggest 'fuck up' in the world...I asked the Universe for help one night: "Please guide me North I don't know where I am or where I'm going. I don't know where else to ask. I don't trust anyone I know. I'll walk the distance and carry my baggage shed what I need to just don't leave me here." I didn't know it then but I had started to work the 12 Steps that night by surrendering (step 1) to and trusting (step 2 &amp; 3) in a Power Greater Than Myself. It wasn't religion but it was genuine I didn't care what the label for it was and I didn't feel the need to tell anyone about it except people who asked me about it. ..I decided to reconnect with my family and explained to them the situation. They allowed me to come home if I promised to stay sober find work help with the family. I complied also started going to meetings almost every day found a sponsor I clicked with started reading the Big Book and working on the Inventory (step 4) and went over it with him (step 5). I felt lighter already and it was relieving to see all my problems on paper in front of me it felt manageable...At this point I just trusted the process and felt that if I was earnest and transparent things would work out in time (Steps 6 &amp; 7). I started to work on projects for clients I met through chance or referral this helped me gain some momentum professionally. I was also starting to right my wrongs (steps 8 &amp; 9) with my family (being a better son brother uncle) to the Earth (reducing my consumption quit eating meat) and for shoplifting (made some calls to corporate offices some donations). I saved some money and planned trips to the Grand Canyon for an adventure and to Colombia for [an ayahuasca retreat](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ayahuasca/comments/772gfc/report_of_first_ever_ayahuasca_experience_and/). I've also gotten out of debt after being in $16k in May 2016 I've quit smoking cigarettes I'm working on letting go of porn I've cut down a lot sugar and processed foods I've deactivated Facebook too! ..Now I am establishing a daily routine that balances work as a creative developer and consultant family learning fitness meditation so that I start each day with a clear mind and warm heart and end each day with a completed task list (steps 10 and 11). Whatever I don't finish today I continue it the next day and keep going. This way of life over weeks and months will compound into a better life than anything I'd ever had in the past I've already seen a big change and I'm just getting warmed up after getting the cobwebs out. I have had 2 different people ask me to be their sponsor I have tried my best to help them and I help strangers all the time on reddit too (step 12). I'm working to build a life where work passions interests causes and service are all aligned and overlapping. ..Alcohol is okay for most people but not for me. It was okay at first but it became a coping mechanism over time and I started to get into bad situations while under the influence. It became more trouble than it was worth it was better for me to just let it go and create a life where I didn't like I needed to drink to cope or fit in.  I've met girls who don't care that I don't drink. I've found communities of people that aren't big into drugs and drinking but more into being healthy active creative of service. I'm only 28 so it's not like I've wasted my whole life I had my first drink at 19 and it became a problem around when I was 22 and was it's worst at May 2015 to May 2017 had months of sobriety in that span but never had 9 months like I do now. Life is good there is no pressure to be anyone or anything! I don't care about getting married or having kids anymore or fitting in at family reunions or looking good on social media! I can just be the best version of myself and do the things I enjoy. ..
I love this. Resonated with me as well. My self esteem is in the ground and it's a struggle to get it any higher but being and staying sober is the least I can do in my journey! 
Great job. You should be very happy with the progress you have made...It seems that no matter if it has been has been 1 hour 1 day or 30 years the challenges are the same remembering that we have value that our lives have worth that we are not defined by a single action and that if we take responsibility for what we are we can become that which we want to be...Your thoughts about doing the work to make changes have much alignment with what I have learned during my journey. The work I have to do today to stay sober must be done with the same intensity as the work I did on the first day of my sobriety. I like to think about something Greg LeMond said about racing bicycles "It doesn't get easier you just go faster"..
Fuck yea. This is what I needed
Wow a mistake made more than once is a d vision. That comment has resonated with me.  Congratulations and IWNDWYT 
Well done :)
This is literally the best post I've ever read on here. Maybe it's just where I am at today but I connected with this a lot and it meant so much to read these words tonight. Thank you and congrats on three years my friend. 
congrats dude!! ..next Tuesday I will be on 3 years myself..Shit my life has changed ALOT..
Hi. I could not stop reading despite my gritty eyes from it being past my bedtime...Your words have impacted me. We all have much in common even amongst our differences. Much obliged and good night. 
Thank you for your honesty. So many times during your story I was like  yeah me too!  I am just starting my journey and am seriously doubting I can stop drinking all together as I have never reached the stage of destruction through alcohol. It is most definitely a crutch for my anxiety but it can also cause crippling depression. .Stories like yours give me another brick to lay into my foundation I can grow from (hee hee how poetic) .Seriously though thank you. 
What an amazing transformation - thank you for sharing your story. I like your goals and ramblings - especially "you don't have to be perfect but always work on being kind to yourself."  Again thank you for posting - it's a pleasure to read.   
Hey mr jones thanks for the incredible post.  Had me welling up on the way into work.  Alot of your post chimed with how i felt the actions ive taken and the decisions i made to drink.  I was dumping so much time into this activity i was adicating responsibility in many other parts of my life.  Its nice to be taking control again.  It sounds like you're in a pretty good place now.  I hope my path continues in a similar vein as yours.  Right now i feel determined to ensure it does...Fuck yeah...I wont drink with you today.  
"I once read that change occurs when the pain of staying the same outweighs the pain of changing.".I loved your story. Thank you. This one sentence you wrote has really stayed with me. I know that getting sober and staying sober is very hard work. I relapsed once after 1158 days sober. It almost killed me that relapse. It's not impossible to stay sober. I *am* going to do it. Thanks for the inspiration my friend.
This is awesome. I wish you were my neighbor mrjones....Great post thanks for this..
Saving this for sure 
Thank you for this. I still have a way to go before I get to three years but it is posts like this that give me inspiration. Well done. 
Thanks alot you inspired me to quit drinking after i finish my bittle of wine(i know i shouldn't but i will)
Congrats on your milestone!  Thank you for posting.
this was amazing and so flipping inspiring. i am so happy for the peace you have obviously achieved. you should be so proud...you took the time to help others and that is incredible...way.to.go!
  I learned to love who I am including my alcoholism  -This is brilliant ! I think what makes the struggle more difficult is  rejecting our demons instead of befriending them. You are a spiritual warrior master! What great Courage!
I saved your post after a first read. I know I'll be going back to it. There is so much here that resonates. Shame being replaced with pride. Not setting the world on fire today perhaps but I'm not going to burn out my potential either. ..I meditated last night a guided meditation with the reminder that we are not our transient thoughts. We are not our passing feelings. We are not the voice in our head that tells us we're not good enough. Then who am I? I'm not sure but as you say I'm someone who can change minute to minute...Thank you so much for your selfless sharing taking the time to write this out and post it for us. And congratulations on 3 years!
Thank you for sharing this.  Have you considered writing a book?  We have Annie Grace and Allen Carr and others but there is something special in your story that we need more of:  not just how to quit but how to be sober.  I thought quitting was all there would be to it - HA!  I've hardly begun the work I need to do.  This narrative of yours put into book form could help a lot of people.  I'd certainly buy it.  Anyway thank you so much for sharing.  Sending you a great big hug and best wishes for your continued success.
Thanks so much for sharing this has been really inspirational and resonates with me deeply. Something that I had to learn recently that you touch on a bit is the capacity to grow. I highly recommend you check out the Growth Mindset by Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck. It sounds self-helpy but it's grounded in academic research and it laid the foundation of all positive change in my life. It's basically the difference between placing more value on some a priori version of yourself or your actions and the dynamics that it entails. It's a great read. ..Also you're an engaging writer. I really enjoyed reading this.
