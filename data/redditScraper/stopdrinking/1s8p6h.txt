Just looked back at my relapse post boy am I feeling sorry for myself! That stops NOW. Picking myself up dusting myself off and facing this beautiful day where we all have the CHOICE the wonderful option of being sober. Maybe it's just the restorative power of coffee talking but I got this. :) And as usual thanks guys. I wish everyone with a drinking problem could discover "stop drinking".

Everyone has to start somewhere. Looks like today is your somewhere. Good luck.
Good for you! There's an AA saying I like: "Poor me Poor me Pour me a drink."
Ata girl!
I've mentioned it to a few people. I'm glad you got your sea legs back for the voyage.
Thanks guys! Gonna climb this mountain in the sunshine. :)
Do you have a smartphone?  You can bookmark the sub as well as the chat and *always* have one of us right there to talk too. =D..Keep up the great work!
This post really helped me. I just reset my stupid badge after drinking. It's EVERYWHERE! But thank you for using the phrase "wonderful option of being sober." Helped me today.
54 days since mine and I'm just starting to get there. Congrats to you on setting your attitude early!
I definitely read this as "Pita Party Over" and I was almost legitimately upset haha. ..Anyway good job! A sunny day is always brighter without the booze.
