Hey guys I ve been lurking on here for a couple of months now and always hoped that one day I would be in a position to participate myself by sharing my accomplishments. For the longest time that felt almost like a fantasy but right now I am on my third day of not drinking any alcohol and I have never been more optimistic about my self control!..Over the past couple of years drinking had become a sort of escape from my struggles. A constant in my life that I could always rely on. Over the last year or two it became a daily thing for me. No matter how bad the day was I knew in the evening I would comfort myself with a couple of beers. Long story short: it got out of control. I was able to keep up a sort of discipline that let me function well enough that for the most part nobody realized I had a problem and for the longest time that was all that mattered to me. Not letting anyone see how much I am really struggling. As long as that worked out I was contempt...Not anymore! I am not contempt with just functioning! So a couple of days ago when I was out with a couple of friends I just declined any offers of alcohol and when I got home I didn t make a stop at the 24/7 store next door. I just went home. ..I didn t even really plan on it. I just did it. And it felt so so freeing..Yesterday I was able to work for a couple of hours on my course materials (I am a college student) which I haven t been able to do for such a long time that I had kind of fallen in a depression because I felt like I would never be able to finish my degree...I can. I will. I m not going to lie I still feel the temptation of going downstairs and grabbing a beer or two in the evening (because what harm could one or two do right??) but I have been able to catch myself immediately and reflect on those impulses...This post has gotten way longer than I intended it to be and now I feel like i m just rambling but since almost nobody in my life knew about my struggles with alcohol I don t really have anyone that I can share my excitement about not drinking with. ..I am very grateful for this community even if I am still very new here. You guys really have been role models for me and have shown me that there is hope...Thank you guys and here's to day three!
