After a year or so of realizing that I've had a problem for a long time but still finding myself unable to quit I've made the decision to quit the poison...I've made posts on here before and kept sober for a few days/weeks at the most but always end up relapsing because I thought "what's the point? A lot of people drink I'm just one of them". When you fall into a self destructive cycle it's easy to get comfortable there. But now I'm done. I'm tired of hanging out with my soon to be fiance and not remembering half the night. I'm tired of us being together and then fighting because we're both drunk and acting irrational. I'm so sick of making excuses for myself and not taking steps to actually get better. ..I'm choosing to quit because I can't be all I can be for the love of my life while I'm drunk. And I'm sure anyone reading this can relate with the fact that there's no such thing as "just a few drinks". Just a few turns into an empty bottle and that has never ever lead to anything good happening. I'm choosing to grow up and separate myself from my unhealthy lifestyle and toxic environment. I refuse to be the drunk husband/father who destroys his life and the lives of those around him. The choice between alcohol and my family isn't a choice at all. I choose sobriety and the ability to provide...Thanks to this sub for all the posts that have been slowly whittling away at me for a while now. I hope you're all doing well. IWNDWYT
