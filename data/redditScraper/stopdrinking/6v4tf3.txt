I just made a new user name (I realized after posting a few times that my user name was my name on a lot of things and wanted to be more anonymous) I had posted a week ago that I was quitting then again on day 3 that I was struggling with depression. The support I received on both posts were great so thank you! I have never gotten past 7 days before aside when I was pregnant with my son. I am feeling a lot more confident today. Usually after I work a ton of hours in a week I think I should reward myself with passing out from drinking everything in the house starting when I wake up (I work nights). Instead today I'm snuggling on the couch with my son trying to convince him to let me take him to the zoo and we have a big day planned for tomorrow as well. I feel like right now my best plan of action is to keep busy with plans to keep me occupied.

And what a great plan! You should definitely go. Keep up the good work!
Good job! Stick with it! I won't be drinking with you today!
