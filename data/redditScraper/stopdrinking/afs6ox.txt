Yesterday was a rough one. I'm still cleaning up messes I made from the great relapse of 2017. Part of making things right required that I go through a ton of old bank statements and other docs to get a handle on just how much I owe folks. In addition my SO has been struggling as her father is at the end stages of Parkinson's disease...Parting with a bunch of money doesn't bother me. On the contrary I'm tremendously grateful that since getting sober I've got the best job I've ever had which enables me to make things right. However going through those statements brought back memories of very uncomfortable times. ..Facing the past is rough. I wasn't craving a drink but I did want that sense of relief brought on by the first couple drinks. ..The best I could come up with was a double bacon cheeseburger fries coke and Charleston Chews for dessert. After putting all that down I got in bed and drifted to sleep at 9:30pm...I was up at 8am this morning. My SO could sense yesterday that my energy was off and I told her over coffee about what I was going through yesterday. She also shared with me the hardship she's feeling with her father's predicament. ..After breakfast I told her that I wanted to go to an AA meeting in the bordering city (my hometown). She was nice enough to drop me off...As is often the case I always feel better leaving a meeting than I do when I first arrive. I've been attending meetings off and on for the last 2.5 years and I always hear something of value. ..After the meeting and feeling slightly guilty about eating all the junk last night I decided that instead of calling an Uber taking the bus or reaching out to my SO for a ride I was simply going to walk home. The whole 8 miles. ..The route I took was not the most direct. I purposely detoured so I could walk a path with less traffic and more nature. Along the way I got to think about a lot of things. How far I've come the work of repairing things ahead. The peace of mind that was so far out of reach yesterday returned. ..It dawned on me that I have come up with new ways to cope that don't include drinking myself in to oblivion. Some days that's cheeseburgers and other days it's a long solitary walk...I have also realized that I have a tendency as with alcohol to do too much. I was hanging out with a friend from AA the other night and his take was that's what alcoholism is.  A disease of more.  ..While I haven't unleashed the  more  beast on alcohol in a little while it's still very much on the table when we're talking cheeseburgers or a Sunday stroll. It's just the way I roll...

This reminds me of the song  cigarettes and chocolate milk' by rufus wainwright. I so so get it. 
The beast of more.  I like that it's... apt.  I've lived that way with everything I do wether is drinking or some crazy hobby or killing myself at the gym like I'm currently doing.  I think that beast is the addict personality trait that we all have in common...We need to let the beast loose on the things that do us good.
