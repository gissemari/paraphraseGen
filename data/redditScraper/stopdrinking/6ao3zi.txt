In the past month-ish:..**Old way of thinking:** I have gone from having over a half of year of sobriety to day zero relapsing I don't remember my nephew's birthday or Easter or turning 28 really I had to borrow money for bills I stopped getting work I was not sober in the least bit for a few weeks (I think) I found a new fucking bottom Boo went to the hospital worked 15 hour shifts for 4 days while house/dog sitting while taking care of Boo while going to meetings my mother and sister are practically living here now I spent every single penny I have made on bad decisions...**New way of thinking:** I learned about red flags to keep an eye out for realized the importance of staying vigilant when things feel "normal" I came back to the community who greeted me with open arms over a year ago & found a warm seat waiting for me (thank you guys!!) I have family who understands and working with me to get back on my feet I got a new job I got a sponsor & home group I have been sober for a few weeks I am not hearing knocking from bellow Boo is home and was well taken care of (& still is and on the mend)  I worked crazy hours like I did when I was younger & happy - turns out I still enjoy doing it (and still good at it too) &&&&& *I still have $4.76 in my bank account (Updated from [I have $7.96 in my bank account](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/68f3ha/i_have_796_in_my_bank_account/))* only spent $3.20 on Boo's balloons :).................So my new job is at the convention center and I have learned [a lot this week](https://imgur.com/a/98dcU). I can handle being around 15000+ people sober - hell I made connections & friends made people laugh laughed with people remembered names/faces etc. I met some really cool talent agencies that are hiring soooo maybe I look into that but also I found a company that pays you to friggin doodle! I didn't know anyone would pay me for taking notes the way I use to! (btw the job title is "graphic recorder" pretty [cool stuff](http://www.imagethink.net/gallery/))...........I realized that walking 12 miles in a day was possible and wasn't going to kill me. And that if I want something bad enough I can do pretty much anything (which is a slightly different way to look at that skill as I was putting it towards getting fucked up for so long. Now I am using that skill in a positive way & I am pretty stoked about that!) Exercise makes me happy & the 20ish minute walk from the parking lot to my job check in gives me time to ground myself after traffic reflect on things and get things moving in a positive direction. ..........I also realized how fucking smelly people are when drinking.... wine breath is no bloody joke! Also these people could handle their drinking... I only saw one guy who threw a beer back slam dunked it in the trash and throw his hands up like he just did a touch down (people's reactions were not pleased at all not that he wobbled or was talking to anyone or had any other signs of being past his limit). Speaking of booze looking back on this work week not one time did booze even cross my mind - which is pretty amazing considering there were over 50 portable bars in one of the rooms I was working in & with the drastic lifestyle change I had I didn't need it to sleep or want it to relax at home :).........I have a few days off - taking over caring for Boo & relaxing a little bit figure out a sleep/work/me time schedule for the next couple weeks running the FlavorRun Saturday with BFF who we have been there for each other in&out of all the bullshit since we were 12 MEETINGS omg I miss them! ( who the fk woullda thought I'd ever say that haha)...............Tl;Dr - I can't believe I am this happy in such a short amount of time. I was soooooo depressed even though I was sober before my relapse I had nothing I felt like nothing I had no one I was no one....... alcohol just intensified those feelings. Bounced back got a job reconnected on here and made connections on IRL - got a reality check/change of perspective/taste of the real me. Oh and I have hung on to >$5 for almost a month without buying booze :)............[High Five](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg) & thank you all for being you and being here - you are not alone and you truly make a difference in my life <3

It's great experiencing things for the a second time that feel like they're brand new with sober eyes.
That $5 is getting some sober miles with you. Impressive!  Sounds like you're doing great Red.  I can relate about exercise getting to work.  I've been biking about 40 minutes to work and back and I love it.  Can't do it on rainy days though which is a bummer.  Fingers crossed for sunshine next week.  
Yes yes !!! All good news !! So happy to hear this !!! Keep up the great work my friend !
