Last month I went on a 10-day binge after eight months without alcohol. 10 days was all I could handle. I was sick as a dog paranoid about what people were thinking and crippled with anxiety about my fate. In a moment of clarity I knew I had to stop again...I am still alarmed that I had such a drastic relapse but I'm glad it was relatively short and that I longed to be sober when I was in the depths of my disease...I am so thankful I had this sub to fall back on immediately. I can't describe how relieving and comforting it is for me. Every morning I look at the new posts and just feel so connected to all of you. I'm not much of an internet person and I never understood how people could get so much out of online communities but now I get it. There is something powerful about all of us sharing our pain and triumphs...So I just wanted to say thanks to all of you and that I love this sub! I'm looking forward to another great day without drinking...Edit: Thank you everyone for your kind responses this is why I love SD!
