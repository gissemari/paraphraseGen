I haven't had many urges to drink since quitting 25 days ago but boy am I right now...Alcohol and airports have always gone hand in hand for me. I'm really struggling to hold it together right now. Could use some support.

Hey well done on 25 days that's great!  There's a chat if you'd like some company to get you through the airport..[https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/#irc://irc.snoonet.org:+6697/stopdrinking](https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/#irc://irc.snoonet.org:+6697/stopdrinking)..&amp;#x200B;..Feel free to drop in
Often helped me to remind myself of all the reasons I quit. I assume you didn't quit because drinking was going great - what were some of the things that motivated you?
I did my first sober flight in twenty two years.  It was weird.  I was awake the entire time and I know what you mean.  It sucks.  I read a book for the first time on a plane in a long time.  Try reading.  Hold it together.  I would drink so much that I would snore and horrify all the other passengers.  ..This isn't going to be easy but I think it will be worth it...&amp;#x200B;
I feel you. I fly a ton for work and a few years ago I did my first dry January (fast forward to today and I'm not not just doing a dry jan but I'm taking a indef leave from drinking). t really was weird to fly and not be drinking/drunk. I've never been a belligerent drunk while on a flight and I usually get the drinks for free in addition to drinking at the lounge for free before hand. I also used to pride myself on "barhopping" or "lounge hopping" in airports. For me the next morning while not hungover (never really got those) was just me waking up in my bed in my hotel room drenched in sweat. My Fly days were literally just me getting plastered. I used to love them. But I always hated waking up in the morning and taking that shower to fully wake up. I'd be sweating out the booze the entire day. Was definitely not a good look. Just sweating walking down the street to get lunch the next day. Not to mention the crappy airport fast food I'd grab while drinking.
I flew Heathrow - Kuala Lumpur - Auckland for ky my first sober flight. Soooo many hours to kill at the airport and I will admit it was a real test...I would always have a few pints while waiting. Instead I had herbal teas and lots of water. When I landed I was so glad to not be hungover. Planes are dehydrating anyway. My jetlag was pretty much non existent and I felt raring to go...Glad you got through this! IWNDWYT
