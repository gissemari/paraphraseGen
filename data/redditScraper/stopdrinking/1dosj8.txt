Sleeping was **for years** something for which I could have won a gold medal. I was a first class Olympic sleeper. I just lay down shut my eyes and was instantly in the arms of morpheus. Thorough restful blissful rejuvenating sleep. That changed years ago when other demons crept in so I medicated the demons and the ensuing sleep difficulties with alcohol. Now the alcohol is over but the good sleeping has not entirely returned...Yesterday I happened to see the Dr. Oz show and he was interviewing Dr. Alejandro Junger who is doing very interesting research on the "second brain": the gut. According to him the gut has an enormous collection of neurons (more than the brain! Who knew?) and produces neurotransmitters. Serotonin a neurotransmitter widely believed to play a role in depression and anxiety is produced largely in the gut (estimates I read speculated 80%-90%). Dr. Junger advocates taking 250 mg. of magnesium each night before bed to improve gut function and boost serotonin enhancing sleep...Okay so I'm no scientist but I was intrigued. I searched the web to find out the side effects and pros/cons of magnesium supplements. A vitamin supplement is still a "drug" so I'm pretty wary -- had enough of doing bad things to myself. Here's what I found:..* magnesium deficiency is common among just about everybody (stated by Drs. Oz and Junger and supported by other medical research)..* >Magnesium supplementation may be indicated for persons with alcoholism. Low blood levels of magnesium occur in 30% to 60% of alcoholics and in nearly 90% of patients experiencing alcohol withdrawal [17-18]. Anyone who substitutes alcohol for food will usually have significantly lower magnesium intakes. (Office of Dietary Supplements National Institute of Health http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/)..I was stunned. Why have I never heard of this before? Not in rehab not anywhere. I would certainly entertain the idea of a mineral supplement before I messed with an antidepressant that one needs to take for 6 -8 weeks before seeing any measurable effect and the dosing is frequently guesswork on the part of the physician. Don't get me wrong I have known people who have benefited greatly from taking antidepressants but I have also known those who have struggled for a long time finding the right meds and dosage and have suffered with unpleasant side effects...Let me be **very** clear -- I am not a physician and I am not recommending mineral supplements. However when I saw my doctor in October about possible depression and sleep issues we talked for 10 minutes and she wrote me a script for an anti-depressant. No blood work nothing. I filled the script but have not taken a single tablet. That experience galvanized me to pursue other possible solutions. I will be seeing her in a month for a physical and I will go in with a list of things I want to track. ..I am suggesting that any of us who suffer depression anxiety and sleep disruption (and there seem to be quite a few of us who do) take this information to our doctors and discuss full blood work to investigate vitamin/mineral deficiency **before** embarking on a more physically emotionally and financially costly way to alleviate these problems. GP's can't possibly know everything all the time. We are the owner/operators of ourselves. More information is always better...Here's the link to the Dr. Oz episode:.http://www.doctoroz.com/episode/dr-ozs-3-day-energy-boosting-cleanse?video=18969..Apologies to all for the wall-of-text!..Edit-- formatting....

They had me taking magnesium in rehab. That and vitamin b. Every day. 
Dr. Oz is a quack in my opinion but I've been taking magnesium to assist in sleeping for awhile. I think I might have even heard about it first on /sd. Hope it helps for you! Deep regular sleep is da bomb.
