Hey there everyone. It's 4AM where I am and I'm treating this like a meeting. The meetings I never went to because I thought I could do it myself..I'm aware now that I have severely misunderstood the community needed in this battle. I relapsed today. And all it proved was that I am 100% an alcoholic. I disappointed my family. Ruined a very new very good relationship. Spent a ridiculous amount of money. Feeling super sick now. Taking the day off work to recover. .Considered going to the hospital. .Because this is a disease. Sometimes I think that maybe I do this so that I can be closer to death and give it an excuse. Give it a name so I feel less terrible for being a failure. .But damnit no. No. We are all here. Whether just reading or posting our struggle. This is what keeps me going. Sincerely thank you everyone here. I definitely fucked up and I'll live with that. But this community gives me tomorrow at the very least. Here we go day one.

A good reminder for us all we are all one drink away from relapse. You know you can do seven months. Let's start again. Take it day by day. Hopefully it won't happen again. Wishing you all the best!
Hi I guess it's all part of the process... Definitely not the most glorious part..Try not to think in problems but in solutions...Step by step day by day hour by hour you will get there! Where? Anywhere you'd like!..
Today is day 1 again for me too. I also think I'm taking the day off of work. I am just in no emotional state whatsoever to go in. Plus I haven't slept at all tonight due to a headache and a pounding heart. Please don't feel alone. IWNDWYT. 
There is so much bravery and courage in your words.  Your rise from your stumble has made you even stronger.  Keep on your path.  I will not drink with you today friend x
Don't beat yourself up.  Lots of us on here have been through the same relapse and got up and tried again.  You can do this best of luck and IWNDWYT

You still did the 7 months. That could have been spent drinking and wasting money. You can do it. Don't feel bad about it now. Move onwards and upwards xx 
Aw so sorry don't be too hard no yourself mistakes happen!  You will be back on track in no time.  Reflect and then put it behind you.  Good luck.
Thankyou for sharing I know that feeling all too well you are worthy of taking this as a tiny mistake its not the end for you  you have done so so so well to even get 7 months sober you know that you feel horrible from this drinking make a commitment. To yourself from today that you are done this time. Get back on the horse my friend. You can do it this time! Write down in a journal  what you feel like today so you can look back on it in the future!    Thankyou. For being here to remind us all of the horrors of drinking. I will not drink today.

The above post is a gem.  Definitely worth reading.
Thanks for sharing - it is useful to read these posts and you help all of us when you talk about these experiences. I am sorry you're in a bad place but it will pass.
Thank you for your post. Posts like these help people like me from slipping. And if I ever should fall I hope I am brave enough to come right back here and do what you have already done today. You are awesome! Please try to be kind to yourself today. (and every day for that matter)    
Alcohol is no joke. And it's advertised heavily in our culture.  We are all one sip away from relapse.  You are on here now so that binge isn't going to continue.  So that's a good thing. I won't drink with you today. 
This disease is chronic PROGRESSIVE and fatal. In my experience each relapse is worse. I vote we avoid having another...You are among friends here. Addiction is not something that can be fought alone which is a realization we all must come to...Welcome back buddy!.IWNDWYT.
Maybe some people do it by themselves but why? There is no virtue in struggling with a dangerous disease it does not prove you are strong...Go to meetings. Also look for information or a program that will really give you the details on the illness including physical and mental mechanisms. It helps to know the devil you are fighting. 
These are mine first sober days after the 7 months relapse. I am in a very good mood since 7 months ago there was first time in my life a sincere attempt to end drinking and now this is the second sincere  attempt and I know that this time I will make it. 
Shit we all fuck up I don't count day's I try to make day's count that's all that matter's! It's a long road we are all the same distance from the ditch.
It's this exact type of post that helps me stay strong . I really appreciate the bravery of posting. I'm almost at 7 months myself and that monster peeks out still and I'm terrified of slipping. Good on you for coming back. I'll not drink with you today .
A bump on a long road isn't something I'd dwell on you know what to do everyone's on board with you IWNDWYT.
relapse is a normal part of learning and recovery.  keep going to meetings now that you understand the disease - you will get it this time around.  dont be hard on yourself. now that you 100% know - u know. and you never have to go back to your old life again :)   dont throw ur progress out the window. it still counts.
