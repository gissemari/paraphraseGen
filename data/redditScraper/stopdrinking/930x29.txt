I used to drink heavily daily and to me that was "normal". My problem was though that was once I started drinking I didnt stop. I'd know I was buzzed one drink away from blacking out or in situations where that next drink would have dire consequences but that couldnt and wouldnt stop me from taking that next drink. Until I literally hit the bed from drinking (or wherever I slept) I could not cut myself off. That's how i knew I had a problem. That and a not so positive medical diagnosis stemming from my drinking. I've made the choice to stop went through detox and have been able to go up to two weeks without a drink. Usually for no apparent reason I can piece together I relapse but only with two beers or a shot or two and can call it quits. Maybe because people are holding me accountable for my drinking so I dont want to disappoint? It scares me because it leads me to think I can control this issue and be a "casual drinker" but know for a fact that's not the case. However Tuesday will mark my two week sober period this run and I look forward to making it past that!

You can do it. We believe in you and your conviction. This is the time that you accept that you ARE NOT a drinker. IWNDWYT
