Currently on a binge where I'm drinking 5-8 tallboys over a 24 hour period. I was drinking nothing but malt liquor and spirits in early January before I quit cold turkey. Managed 4 days clean before I had a breakup to deal with and at dinner with a friend I opted to have some drinks with my meal. I've been progressively purchasing lower-alcohol-content beer as I've gone. I started as high as I can get then maintained with 6% beers I'm at 4%ers now still on 5-8 a day. I'd go for lower percentages but I don't think that's possible with gas station selections. I've noticed the difference immediately; the buzz is weaker I don't feel as blasted I don't pass out after a can and a half the depression isn't as bad. I'm more coherent and can do some stuff but I'm still obviously drinking 5-8 a day...&amp;#x200B;..I've noticed mild withdrawals tend to kick in 6-8 hours after my last drink vastly exacerbated by having to interact with people and feeling anxious; I get noticeable tremors extremely nervous and anxious. Isolating myself and sweating it out isn't really an option due to my living circumstances and work. Combined with the breakup my diet has completely gone to shit and I eat maybe once a week when I remember to eat. The beer shits are awful; I have to go (I really don't think I'm exaggerating) some 10 times a day and it's the same liquid foamy acidic shits. I'm afraid to leave the house for extended periods because I'm worried I won't be able to control my bowel movements. For those who've tapered successfully how bad were the withdrawals? I went through a binge last August with a friend who relapsed; I'd have a couple of Four Locos and 6-8 strong beers with the odd shot thrown in. I remember the Monday I flew back to my state I pounded back a few beers before my morning flight and by Tuesday night I was seemingly fine if feeling a little mentally foggy with seemingly no withdrawals. ..&amp;#x200B;..Any tips/advice from guys who've successfully tapered?

The only thing that any one of us can do is to tell you to see a doctor. We have strict rule against seeking detoxing advice on this site because withdrawal can be dangerous even deadly and should be supervised by a doctor. We have removed your post and hope you'll speak to a physician.
