I am still struggling a bit with sobriety. ..This year I lost a job and lost a sister and ended up in rehab. I am grieving my sister and started a new job that is service oriented. ..I sleep peacefully every night. The only problem is that I am feeing sorrow more than i have in a long time. I am not really tempted to drink. My emotions are not quite working. Sometimes I am just numb and sometimes I wish I could cry. Maybe I will make an emotional breakthrough this year.
