Fuck my mother for saying she's done with me until my shits straightened out because I expressed to her my abusive step father pushes me to relapse I'm absolutely alone and she's my only outlet to express that I'm fucking hurting inside she abandoned me when I was 14 because I started cutting and she had a new bf and "couldn't handle it" so I'm sent to a fucking abusive home with an adoptive father and a grandmother that hates my guts woo! Yay I get to go to school and get bullied what a prize! So I'm sitting here sober closing in on a month and I'm left completely alone again I even listen to her bitch about this same bf who now is her husband about sleeping in separate rooms and being alone and how bad it is I LISTEN like actually listen. I want to drink so bad to numb this shit.  Excuse my language I'm just in pain. Going to throw 100lbs in a ruck and walk until my legs break I'm so angry right now.

I use the 12 steps of AA to process all of the emotions so I'm not boiling over.  The fellowship helps me feel like I'm not alone.  There are local meetings in many places.
A piece of wisdom that I've valued is this: Someone will lead and someone will serve. Either you run the day or the day runs you. You get to choose.
