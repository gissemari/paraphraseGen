That was the best month I remember.  Been kicking myself pretty hard past few days for messing up but as you all know that doesn't do any good.  Really embarrassed about going back to work after using fmla time for my 3 day bender.

I think that's implicitly prohibited by the "no soliciting personal info" rule but there is a daily check-in post and I think it's a pretty good idea. Don't beat yourself up too much; we all screw up!
Sorry about that.  I edited the post.  Thanks for the kind words and the tip about the check in post.   
What are you going to do differently this time?
I fell away from meetings and I need those. My brother who is 2 years sober advised me to get a temporary sponsor so that I have someone to be accountable to. It will be nice to have someone to call daily and let them know I haven't been drinking. The weekend is a big trigger for me so Saturday morning I am going to the nursing home my grandma was in and offer to volunteer.
