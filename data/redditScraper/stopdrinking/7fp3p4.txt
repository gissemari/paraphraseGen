Hello everyone.After drinking pretty hard for the last 10 years I have finally decided to call it quits. Today is my second day without alcohol. In my mind I didn't have much of an issue. I have had 3-6 beers a night with a bottle of scotch on the weekends (with beer in the afternoon before the scotch) for as long as I can remember. 10 years ago I was drinking a handle of Bacardi with a few beers as a chaser. So my current habits didn't feel excessive. I am still in pretty decent shape and go to the gym regularly and have had a successful career- that's how I justified the drinking. Today I started feeling like complete crap and thought maybe I was getting a cold/flu. When I googled symptoms of quitting I saw that everything was listed right there for me. This makes it more real for me. I had an issue whether I wanted to admit that to myself or not. I have no friends/family so support is limited to an app that tracks how much money I am saving. An extra ~3k a year into retirement will go along way. Anywho you all give me motivation. Thank you for all for sharing your stories and reminding me that I am not alone in this struggle. Happy Sunday :)
