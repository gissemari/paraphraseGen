Besides trying to get through this sobriety lifestyle I just left my business in May and am just so STIR crazy trying to figure out next move and making some huge decisions all while not picking up a drink..everything has really gotten to me today. ..Sadly times like these I do miss the black out. Just the forgetting for awhile. Not the dumb shit I did. ..I think I've failed at sobriety before because I missed the  forget life for awhile  part. ..Trying to find other things to keep me busy but not wanting to do anything Everything feels mundane. ..It's so crazy how one day I feel incredible the next crawling out of my skin.....Struggling hard but #IWNDWYT

I feel you. It hurts my self esteem when I relapse though. I hope you feel better tomorrow. Is there some way to treat yourself without alcohol? Dessert? Maybe a nice bath. I'm going to schedule a massage.
