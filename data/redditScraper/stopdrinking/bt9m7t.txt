I hate myself. I hate being hungover. So uncomfortably hungover that I can't even sleep. Time to start over.

No one can go back and make a new beginning. But anyone can start today and make new ending. Rooting for you friend! IWNDWYT
I'm two days in from my last blackout. First time i accepted the truth. First time I've truly quit.  I know what you mean about hating yourself; I'm really hoping to like myself more once the brain heals up a bit. I hope you find a you that you like better too.
