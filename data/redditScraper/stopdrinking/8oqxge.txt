Hi all I just wanted to give a quick update as well as keep myself accountable for what I want to get done today. Here's my post from yesterday...[My previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/8ohb81/whoever_said_that_withdrawals_get_worse_with_each/)..First I wanted to say wow thank you all for the responses. I got so many that I couldn't respond to all of them. It was a nice way to spend a partially miserable experience...I'm glad to say things went pretty well yesterday. I found some gatorade in the back of the fridge nursed that down and finally got hungry enough to eat. I took some vitamins after that which helped really level things out. I had my older son with me during the day and I got him out to a splash park in the afternoon something I'd been promising him but have been too drunk to do so. We got there a little early so I talked to him about what happened on Saturday when he couldn't wake me up. He's still young yet so he doesn't know specifically about alcohol but I did tell him I took too much of something that was bad for me and that I was really sorry for scaring him. He said it was okay and I tried to explain that it wasn't but it was a good therapeutic moment on a day that I couldn't make it to AA...Well I could have made it to a 9pm meeting but instead I fell asleep reading to my younger son at about 830pm! I did still have some more minor chills and sweats and the sleep wasn't particularly solid. But after Sunday night I think getting some extra rest might have been better than a meeting. I have a noon meeting today in about three hours that I'm definitely headed to...Well that ended up being a bit longer than I expected but thanks again for the responses yesterday. And thanks as well to everyone who posted throughout the day. I honestly read every one until I fell asleep and they were good for me to read whether the update was happy or sad. I'm going to be reading them all again today. IWNDWYT!

Well done for slogging through it!..I felt quite a bit better by the 7-10 day mark hopefully you're nearly over the hump... Keep going!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Explaining to kids is so hard. My daughter hides food because of her guilt . Much as I did qutg alcohol. Withdrawals in the beginning are awful but you'll get there.. I'm sure of it.
Being able to be present for my daughter is one of the things I have loved about the times I have been able to stay sober! IWNDWYT!
The absent of sleep is the worst thing about the withdrawals for me haven't had a drink since Saturday night \(Tuesday evening now\) and still can't sleep just walking around like a zombie.
Just started Librium for w/d and it's a freaking miracle! Highly recommend it.
