hello all. i want to start by saying that midnight tonight is three weeks since my last drink. it was a very very hard decision to make. i have been binge drinking 5+ days a week for about 12 years. i am 28. it got to the point in record time this go around that i was drinking every night (i manage a liquor store so supply was not an issue) extremely heavily to the point of blacking out on my own for no fucking reason.. i have known i have an issue with alcohol for a long time. this is my second attempt at getting clean. the last time i went over three months. but i was taking a lot of xanax smoking a ton of weed and doing a lot of coke to compensate (i tricked myself into thinking this was ok??) during this time i met a wonderful woman and got engaged. however due to a relapse that i could not come back from my drinking started up again and continued to escalate to the point i was at three weeks ago taking shots of 103 proof bourbon at 1030 in the morning while my fianc e and our baby were sleeping upstairs.  i had to almost lose my fianc e and our three month old daughter (she was going to leave me if i didn't make a change) to wake the fuck up. this is my second bout with sobriety. true sobriety this time though. the only substances i have put in my body have been caffeine and nicotine for three weeks. i will worry about the cigarettes later. .that being said i have some questions and if you wouldn't mind helping out and maybe answering a few it would be extremely beneficial to me and my family. i am trying to be the best man possible for the two women in my life who need an anchor not a miserable drunk SOB. ..1) are rapid mood swings (manic to depressed) anxiety and increased feelings of tension normal? and if so for roughly how long can i expect them to last? i feel like my brain is working 100% for the first time in ten years and i find myself overthinking and over analyzing to the point that is detrimental to my relationships. ..2) does AA really make that big of a difference? and if so does it matter which group you go to? i looked them up and there are multiple groups at different times on different days but i don't want to commit to just going to one a week on the same day etc as my work schedule won't always permit that. ..3) how much should i discuss this process with my wife to be? i don't want to seem like i am just making excuses for myself but i am fairly sure that i am have severe emotional withdrawal symptoms. she is extremely supportive of this decision and is constantly telling me how happy the man i am becoming makes her but the mood swings and anxiety are (understandably) hard for her to handle especially with our newborn in the house. i want to talk to her about these things but i also don't want to overload her as we have enough going on. i don't want to be another drain on her emotionally. ..4) how long before i truly start to see the positive consequences of this decision? this is legitimately the most sober i have been since i was 16 for any length of time and i am worried that my emotional and maturity development have been stunted by the alcohol and drug use so regularly for such a long time (12 yrs.) i am really trying to become a better person father and husband. i just want to feel the results inside instead of just being sober enough to fake it  . cause the truth is being sober sucks. but being under the influence feels nice for a few hours however what that substance abuser does to my life is nothing but negative and it took me far too long to realize that and the effects it had on my loved ones. ..again any advice knowledge or answers to my questions are greatly appreciated. regular people don't understand these kinds of things and i'm not sure where to turn or how to turn. .please wish me luck and if you have any personal experiences i would love to hear them as this is all new territory for me...thank you for listening and good luck to all on your personal journeys. .21!!!!
