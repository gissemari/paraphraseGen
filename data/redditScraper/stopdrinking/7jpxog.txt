I didn't think I'd laugh so much! What a neat group of people. It was kind of like being on stop drinking but in person. Everyone was there due to alcohol abuse. To welcome me everyone shared their stories of why they were there. Everyone laughed and told jokes and shared struggles for the three hours I was there. It will be an eight week program four days a week...My share was a little different. I talked about this morning. I had a bottle of peppermint schnapps staring at me and all I wanted to do was get wasted. But I had this appointment today and I knew if I didn't go today I never would. I put off going last week. This felt like my last chance. Today when I got home I found my SO had dumped the bottle. Today is yet again my day one.
