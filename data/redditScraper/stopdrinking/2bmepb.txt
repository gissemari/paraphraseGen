As I said in my regular wednesday meeting last night It is amazing how much has changed in 90 days.  I would pass a liquor store on the way to my meetings and pass a bar on the way home.  At the start it was a fight with myself to stay out of those buildings.  This lead to "maybe next time" which has lead to my current state of mind "Remember when you (me) would struggle just to drive by this place....look at you now!"..I know 90 days isnt a super long time and the journey is just beginning but when I reflect on where I was compared to where I am now and ultimately where I want to be I get excited!  There are many things in this world I have yet to discover.  Many things I will choose to experience while being sober...Thank you /SD this place has helped in many ways to get me to 90 days!
