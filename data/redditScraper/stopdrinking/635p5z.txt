Day 2 second day at work staring at my computer screen doing nothing can't focus can't concentrate lethargic from top to bottom struggling to sleep getting more and more anxious about the work I'm not doing

Healths more important then work. You will start to feel better. I'm on day 6 feel normal ish now. Day two was the worst for me but it was the turning point.
Thanks
I'll get through the day lack of productive output won't get noticed today but I'm worried it will if it goes on. Not somewhere where I can discuss personal problems with my manager. I do appreciate you taking the time
