I've been trying so hard to be good to keep myself above water but today I feel like I'm drowning.  All I keep thinking about is if I go buy some alcohol I can drink until I pass out and then at least I'll have some peace for awhile.  I don't know what to do I want to end it all this pain is too much to bare.  I hate myself.

You have the power to succeed and things can get better. I don't know you but it breaks my heart to hear you say you hate yourself. You must start by loving yourself and believing that you are worth it. We are all on this journey together just read some of the stories in this sub and you will see it is possible.

I've found that a lot of my self hatred is created and enhanced by alcohol. Weight gain? Booze. Procrastination? Booze. Bitchy attitude? Booze. Not being present in my life and the life of my friends and family? Booze. ..Sobriety will help you heal the hate and move towards loving life. Promise. I'm about three and a half months in and my life is already drastically more positive. ..Stay strong.
Why not [look for some real life help](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index#wiki_real_life_support_groups).  When I felt like that it is what I did and it eventually worked for me.  I felt the exact same as you when I was drinking today I like my life.  Good luck.
