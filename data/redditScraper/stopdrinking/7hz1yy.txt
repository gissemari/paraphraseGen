But I'm not gonna give in despite me feeling very down and emotional. I've had college today and had to eat two chocolate bars and a big choc bar crisps and salad to get through today.  Washed down with coke and Dr pepper.  I've felt like crying most of the day and I'm feeling like I'm missing booze   I feel like I've lost a friend. The friend who helped me for a short while of relief when I couldn't control cravings.  I just want these feelings to go away but I know I have to 'grieve' even though it's a crutch that's not really my friend. I feel a bit silly to be honest calling it a friend but I want to get through the rest of today and remain sober. Thanks for listening

You sound just like me yesterday! If you looked at me you would have thought I lost my best friend. I completely understand. I do however feel much better today :) I am sure we are gonna have good days and bad days. Hang in there! We got this :) I will not drink with you today!
Good job friendo. I miss alcohol too. I used it to fill a void now I need to work on real social relationships to fill that void with something besides liquor. 
I genuinely appreciate that you are powering through another day without drinking   .Just don't put the booze in your mouth!  . iwndwyt
i know how you feel. i'm 3 days sober but already almost regretting it. like i miss the comfort of getting blackout drunk on wine. like how ridiculous does that sound? but when you're flat out honest about it that's what it is. so i totally get you. and acknowledging those feelings are more than half the battle so keep being open keep being honest :)  i will be sober with you today also!
