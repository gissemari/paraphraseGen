Day 23 and realize that I got cocky around the two-week mark. I had gotten past the worst of detoxing and was having a particularly good couple of days mid-week and it seemed like things were definitely getting easier. Then... the weekend. Ugh the weekends! Not so easy Mr. Confident...What I failed to recognize is this is a journey and it's not a sprint it's a marathon. Some days are easier than others but man! I'm struggling on the weekends. I've been bowling on Friday nights. It's okay but when we left the bowling alley last Friday my wife said "that was fun" and I replied "yeah.. but was it?"..I just read a post here on sd that referenced the 'pink cloud' which I had never heard of. I think I was feeling the effects of the pink cloud when I thought to myself "I've got this!". Now I'm still committed but I see it's going to be a long hard trek...Anyway I needed to write. To pay homage to the struggle. Tis Sunday and  IWNDWYT

Love the honesty.  Yes the ups and downs feel new as we're dealing with them sober - real emotions ...Keep up the good work.  You can do this!! IWNDWYT 
It's not a marathon and it's not a sprint.  Thinking like that made things unnecessarily complicated and hard when I did it.  It's just today.  Simple.  No marathon to run.  No mt. Everest to climb.  Just.  today.  Just do what you have to do to live well today.  Tomorrow and yesterday can fuck right off.  They are not your responsibility right now today.
