Today is the start of day 7 and I feel every last drop of alcohol is finally out of my system. The headaches have stopped though I'm so lethargic and achy. I have so many household chores to catch up on and I feel my energy levels will struggle. ..Does anyone have any advice to push through the tiredness?..I'm hoping the walk to my support group will lift my mood and give me a boost. Afterwards I'm going to hit the supermarket and stock up on fresh fruit and vegetables. Hopefully natural vitamins and minerals will perk me up a bit.

I was totally winded for the first two or three weeks after quitting. Seems to be part of the program. I started to feel normal around a month. Your body and mind probably need rest. I used a lot of magnesium and different vitamins (still do) I think they helped quite a bit. 
I know it's unhealthy but I am not denying myself anything food wise for the moment (I'm in day 9 of no drinking). ..I want a chocolate bar? Fine! Burger? Do it! ..Its so exhausting trying to keep beer's hooks out of back that I can't waste any energy on other areas of my health at the moment. Will rein it in once I hit 3 weeks or so but for now that is helping me keep energy levels up- both through the high calorie content of the food (which is mitigated slightly because I'm not drinking 3k calories of beer a week!) and through not having to expend even more energy on willpower saying no to myself when it comes to food. ..Keep up the good work! 
I hope you don't push yourself too hard. Give your body and mind the rest it needs. Take care and keep it up!
