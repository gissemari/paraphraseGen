But that's okay because I knew this day was coming a long time ago I just didn't know when. Hopefully this motivates me to get my shit together or I don't know how much longer I can take it I work so hard for almost no benefit shit gets so old. So tired of drinking no matter what I do I just can't stop...I'm going to try again though...Thanks for listening.

I hope the best for you.  
You can do this! Stay strong. I will not drink with you today.
I found that talking to other people who have the same problem as me really helped (although I have no idea why). AA meetings provided that for me but there are other recovery groups out there. 
The only sure fire way to fail is to quit trying. Don't ever quit!..Sending out some positive energy for you!
I just want to say that as someone who WAS homeless sobriety helped me to get my shit together and get housing.  Being female and out there alone was terrifying! If I had been drunk goodness knows what what have happened...
Look friend I'm starting this without knowing exactly where I'm going with this because despite that 52 day badge sitting there winking at you I need a reset. I relapsed Hell if I'm honest I have a beer by my side atm...But don't for one minute let any of that dilute what I'm about to say. You are stronger than me. Plain and simple you've realised that this is the impetus for change...Shit might get worse short term but if you take it one day at a time then it can only get better long term. The fact that you admit it and still get up for another round of fighting the creature means that I have more respect for you than you know...When I was 5 He-Man was my hero because he could do amazing shit I couldn't. Today you are for the very same reason. I wish you the very best for your road ahead.
