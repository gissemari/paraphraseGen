Of course my little bender lasted the whole weekend. Everyone here thinking they can control "just one more weekend of drinking".... well I hope you're stronger than I...I won't give up though. I'm starting again right now. I have these moments where the whole giving-up-drinking thing makes so much sense. I like the energy I get from these moments. I will continue my struggle to achieve that state...Have a great and healthy day people

Knowing is half the battle and all that jazz. What do you plan on doing differently this time around to put yourself in a good position?
The key for me was that I gave up thinking I could drink controllably. The last time I tried I had a spectacular fall from grace. After I bounced back from that I wrote down all the shit that happened so I'd have a reminder. Our addict brains tend to focus on the good things and gloss over the bad after all. 
Good for you.  Never give up!
The only man who has failed is the one who stops trying :) Keep going
