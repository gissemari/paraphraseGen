I broke my pledge to not drink a few weeks ago. It started with me just wanting to feel DIFFERENT. I've been struggling a lot with a breakup and some repeated bad thoughts. The drinking didn't help at all. Obviously. Oh I felt different but it was a worse feeling. ..I also went on a date where I ended up stupid incoherent drunk where I also ran into my ex. I just can't see her anymore but we live in a small city and do similar activities. I guess I'm just struggling with how to be social without booze but also why do I need to even be social right now? I was doing soooo well sanity-wise when I was sober. ..Anyway I ended up trying to moderate and drank beer (PBR mostly. Vodka used to be my drink so this felt "safer"... it's not!). ..I am not proud of any of this and I want to rededicate to sobriety.  I don't think I should really be trying to date I need to focus on myself and my health and sanity first.

You should be proud about the part that you want to rededicate to sobriety and will not drink today. How easy would be to not do that right now.....I think the same way about the socialization. ..&gt;why do I need to even be social right now?"  ..This is the question I make myself everyday and the awnser that I am giving to myself lately is "No you don't need right now"..Grab a new badge e let's not drink today
Coming back sharing and resetting your badge -- those are things you *can* be proud about.  Taking a break from dating sound incredibly wise.  Welcome back!!
Good to see you holding yourself accountable. I hear many stories of people breaking sobriety and then going on 8-10 year drinking binges.   You have caught your slip up quickly and are choosing to get right back into sobriety.  What you are doing shows incredible self awareness and dedication.  I am inspired by your humility and honesty.
