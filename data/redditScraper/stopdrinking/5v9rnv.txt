Relapsed. Thursday. I had a job interview. I was well.prepared and felt good going in but frankly they asked a lot of weird questions and it didn't go well. It was also a phone interview which I find to be super difficult. Had a glass of wine to cheer myself up. Then another. Then another. Etc. Spoiler alert: I just made myself feel worse at the end of the day. New rule going forward. Not a single drop. It doesn't help. Don't need it in my life.

I am in the same boat as you...I'm sorry about your interview not going as well..Do you have a plan for avoiding the trap next time?
Know exactly how you feel.  For me its like the saying "One is too many and a thousand is not enough"..One day at a time now
