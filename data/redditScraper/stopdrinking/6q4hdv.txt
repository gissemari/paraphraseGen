Wow! Today marks my 100th day of sobriety. I owe so much to SD and everyone who has shared their experiences here the good the bad and the ugly. 100 days ago I found myself at rock bottom and it was inconceivable to me how I would ever turn it around. The single greatest support mechanism has been checking in here daily you all have been the best reminders to stay the course. I cannot even describe how much my life has improved I truly feel as though I've got a second wind in life. To anyone struggling please know that it gets SO much better I still have a long way to go but am very proud of my progress so far. Wishing you beautiful people out there the very best of luck keep going not drinking with you today!!!..#100
