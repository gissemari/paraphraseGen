At about 30 days of not drinking I was struggling and about to throw in the towel. I saw this quote and had one of those high speed life flashbacks of all the horrible things that had come and gone in my life that were related to alcohol and ever since then this has been my goto mantra when needed. I choose everything else and everyday that choice gets easier. Fuck Alcohol!

I love this. I'm a writer and I remember having a realization: you can either be a great writer or a great drinker but you can't be both. After what seems like a million chances I finally made the right choice. Thanks for the reminder.
"I never really lost everything to alcohol because I never really got anything to begin with". &lt;- my story never successful drank/made friends/anything I actually wanted to accomplish. Ever since stopping drinking I now have like everything I actually wanted to get from drinking social ability friends having a good time. But my crazy mind drives me back to consider "hey maybe you can have all that while drinking again you've had some time your cured you'll just do this a little differently and it'll work out just don't do this and that and you'll be fine" &lt;- LIES going out to meet with another recovering alcoholic now. Cheers everyone and stay the fight just another day today. 
I see variations of that phrase often here and it is so true for me.  The opportunities that open up when I am not drinking are endless. Thanks for the post.
