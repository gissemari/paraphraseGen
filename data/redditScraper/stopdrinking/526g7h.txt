Of course it is all bar hopping and drinking. It isn't a struggle for anyone else but it really sucks. I'm trying to have fun and not hamper the mood. I've made it over a year and this is just one more hurdle that is part of my life. I will not drink today.

Maybe a good time to come down with a headache and head home.  
I won't drink with you tonight!
