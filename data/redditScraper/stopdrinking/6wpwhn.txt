Can't believe I made it to double digit days without the booze. I thank the folks on SD and God for the journey so far.....your advices strugglesinspirational stories and above all....your resolve to make a turn around and improve your lives by quitting has motivated me beyond my wildest imagination. I have learnt we are humans after all...and by joining hands with people who we have never seen from different parts of the world is a powerful tool in this struggle. So thank you all and I shall not be drinking with you today.

Congrats on the double digits - I remember feeling so great when I hit them. Before you know it you'll have a shiny star. Well done and I will not drink with you today.
Great job! Thanks for sharing :).
Woot! Congratulations! I will not drink with you today.
Well done you! That first week was so hard for me. I remember how great it was to get that under my belt and then to reach double digits!..It gets better and better. Some days are not wonderful but the trajectory is an overall up up up!..Best wishes.
