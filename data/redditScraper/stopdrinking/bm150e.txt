And it is hard! ..So this is my first post here but I've been following for a long time. Around this time last year I made a decision to cut down on my drinking. I was up to around 15 beers a night with a smattering of shots thrown in for good measure. I'm a bartender so going out after we close and getting hammered is just part of the social scene for almost everyone I associated with. ..Since then I have cut down substantially but was feeling myself sliding back into old habits. A beer after work slowly tiptoed back to three beers and a bottle of wine after work. Moderation was not working for me after all. ..My boyfriend suggested we go completely sober for the month of May...because he was noticing I was struggling. I think I want to keep it going after May because already I feel just so much better and am getting so much done. Seeing friends in non-drinking situations reading getting up before noon...big things poppin. ..All that being said I am here on day seven and my brain goes to  you've made it a whole week! You can have one beer after you close.  But I didn't. And I won't let my thoughts goad me in to making that choice. Because I know one won't be just one. I want to continue living this enriching sober life I now have. ..Anyway. Thanks for reading. IWNDWYT
