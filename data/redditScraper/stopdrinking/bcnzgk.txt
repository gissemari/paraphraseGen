As a basketball fan (particularly the Portland Trailblazers) and also someone who has been working to cut down my drinking for physical and mental (generalized anxiety disorder)... I found this article interesting. No matter who you are or what you have accomplished in life the struggle can hit really anyone.....https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/2019/04/12/greg-oden-descended-into-alcoholism-and-bulimia-then-fought-his-way-out/3391778002/

Thanks for sharing I'm not big into sports but he has a powerful story. IWNDWYT
Inspiring story and an all-to-common one that sadly often has a much worse outcome. A guy I went to high school with who was a HUGE star on our basketball team and went on to play college and then pro basketball literally drank himself to death in his early 40s when he retired. He was 6'7" but his organs were literally destroyed by alcohol. It's so motivating to see people turn their lives around. Thanks for sharing!
