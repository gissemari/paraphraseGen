Glad to be in the double digits again after my relapse with a friend a week and a half ago. I did almost a month before that but had a stressful day that took me out...I just got back from my doctor and I let her know the whole mess. I told her that I self medicated stress and because of that I was slowly killing myself. At first I was worried but she seemed to completely get where I was coming from...She did a medication adjustment for my insomnia and told me to keep her in the loop. She was happy that I was making a change for the better and that I have had progress (Mostly due to you fine folks)...Thank you for being there for me. Between you guys my pastor and my doctor I have no doubt that I can keep this up.

Congrats on the 10 days and honesty with your doctor. Let us know how we can help!
Good work /u/JackHolliday -- building momentum!
Good job on jumping right back on the wagon. Many of us would still be on a bender hating ourselves and life.
