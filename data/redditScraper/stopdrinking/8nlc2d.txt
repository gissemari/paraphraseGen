I had been sober for two weeks just long enough to convince myself that I didn't "really" have a problem. I figured there would be no harm in treating myself to a few drinks. I decided that as long as I called one of my old drinking buddies from out of state it wouldn't really qualify as drinking alone. Of course those few drinks became many more after riding my bike to the nearest 24/7 convenience store once my buzz started to wear off. My memory got a bit cloudy at that point and I just have to hope I didn't say anything particularly stupid...I woke up feeling like absolute shit. The hangover itself wasn't so bad it was the anxiety and depression that I had tried to numb away that got to me. I thought I felt like crap the day before but after all those feelings came back I felt more empty than ever. Thankfully though I had the sense to not start drinking again in the morning like I often used to do. If only I had been honest with myself about why I wanted to drink in the first place. If I had done that I would have realized the alcohol wouldn't have helped in the first place...I figured I'd share this so that anyone thinking of making the same mistake might be dissuaded. It would also be nice to feel a little less alone in my struggles.

Thanks for sharing this. I'm struggling with the idea of getting drunk tonight.
We've all been there. Kudos for you for having the courage to share this and for recognizing the issue. You got this.
You are not alone buddy! Don't be to hard on yourself and be really proud that you didn't continue to drink in the morning I'm sure that was a temptation hard to resist. .Onwards and upwards from here friend tomorrow will be a tiny bit easier!
