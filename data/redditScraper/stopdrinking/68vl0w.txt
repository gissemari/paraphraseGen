I'm struggling...big time.  I'm depressed and I want to drink or pop a few pills to escape 'just for a little while'.  I know that one time will turn into every day so I don't but I'm hurting so much inside.  Whenever I call my sponsor she just tells me to get my a$$ to meetings.  I'm a single mom with sole custody I work full time my 15 yr old daughter has severe emotional/behavioral/ psychiatric issues & was recently placed in a residential therapeutic school.  She comes home on weekends and I have to transport to & from (2+ hrs round trip) every Friday & Sunday.  She is high demand & high need.  My 12 yr old son has ADHD but all in all is pretty darn easy.  My job can be demanding and I often have to work late; when I don't work late I want to give my son my attention & time.  I also was VERY sick about a year ago (pneumonia sepsis organ failure life support etc...) and have lasting issues mainly extreme fatigue from that ordeal.  People don't understand my daughter and they don't understand my issues (even though I generally keep them to myself) so it's very hard to relate to anyone.  I've isolated again like I did when I was drinking.  I live in a very small rural town so meeting new people is next to impossible anyway.  I used to have friends but have been slowly figuring out which ones are 100% real and which aren't.  I'm down to one...she lives 5 hours away.  I need a therapist but no practices near me are accepting new patients.  Soooo...anyway...I'm looking for some creative ways to get AA meeting style support & here I landed.

Try intherooms online meetings. Won't your sponsor work with you one on one?..
I got something valuable out of online AA meetings in 2015 and I'm sure they've only improved since then. They had text chat meetings that started around 8 p.m. EST. I used to get ready for bed fire up my laptop and end my day that way (I start work extremely early in the morning). ..It sounds like you are going through a lot and trying your best to take care of your family and health. I admire that! Keep fighting; you are worth it...
Welcome! This place has been my main sober support as it's fit well into my lifestyle. I've found healthier ways to take a break/escape "for a while" - just getting some me-time with a walk reading a book listening to a podcast etc. None of the negative side-effects that I got from drinking.
You landed in a great place!! Welcome to SD! From what I understand there are many different online groups you can attend either it be AA SMART Refugee Recovery Life Ring OMAGOD etc. I haven't done an online meeting personally but I know they are there. If you are feeling froggy though over on the side bar is a link to our IRC Chat and there is always a handful of people in there :)..[High Five](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg)
Smart recovery also has online meetings. That is tough. Stay strong! 
Thank you so much everyone!!  I made it to a meeting last week.  My sponsor walked in and gave me the "Look who the cat dragged in" smile.  lol  I've also checked out In The Rooms.  WOW!!!  That is completely different from how it was just over a year ago &amp; MUCH better.  I attended a couple of video meetings on my phone but was unable to share because I'm on a phone &amp; the tech was 'glitchy' but I was very able to listen to people's shares...&amp; we all know that sometimes its good to just shut up &amp; listen too!  :)  I also got a surge of positive energy &amp; took the initiative to just start calling counselors like crazy until I found one accepting new patients.  The 3rd one I called was able to fit me in yesterday...&amp; I loved her!  I really need to work on staying in the 'now' and realizing that getting 'down' is normal but letting it take control is unhealthy.  I'm far from bright eyed &amp; bushy tailed right now but I'm much better than I was last week.
