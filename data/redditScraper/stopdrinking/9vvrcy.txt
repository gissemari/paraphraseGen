I was 30 days sober until I found the last bit of a vodka bottle in one of the old hiding spots when I was cleaning the house this morning. I didn't even think I just slammed it. Sure enough my girlfriend who I love with caught me in the act and now it's back to square one. For her I think it was the last straw. We had cleared all the booze out of the house a while ago and I have no idea why I ruined such a good thing for no reason. She won't talk to me and I am horribly depressed. I didn't (and I won't) go all the way down like I normally do but I don't know what to do with this sadness or what to say to my gf who is just exhausted by this now...Please help.

We're glad that you're here and still looking for support. We do have to remove this post as you admit drinking tonight. [From our FAQ:](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index#wiki_post_only_while_sober.)..&gt; **Post only while sober.**..&gt; We recognize that many people spend months "lurking" this subreddit while drinking. You are welcome to read as much as you'd like while not sober. However for the sake of everyone here and for the sake of your own recovery please only post or comment when you're sober. "Sober" means "not currently intoxicated or under the influence in any way."
