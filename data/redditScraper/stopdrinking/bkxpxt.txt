I bought a handle of whiskey for my wife on Friday she has her own struggles and that's for her to deal with.  I can only support her if she chooses to try the sober path.  So last night the weather was beautiful  we sat outside listening to music and talking. I went in the house and came back with a wine glass full of strong hibiscus tea. If you guys ever drank hibiscus tea it looks exactly like red wine. She looks at me and asks when did you get wine? I didn't. What do you mean there's wine in your glass non judgemental just a statement. I  said see how easy it is to fool our brain. She thought about it for a minute and stated laughing. She put her drink away and got a water. Hmm? Iwndwyt. Love you guys.

My daily unimpaired life is the best testament !
That is awesome! Hibiscus tea sounds so good right now!
NA beer poured into a pint glass will fool everyone in a bar. That's how I run it when playing gigs these days.
Hey I *just* made Jamaica like 20 minutes ago :). It's chilling in the fridge. I'm going to try this trick tonight. Thanks :)
