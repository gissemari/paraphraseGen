[his blog](https://www.memoirsofanaddictedbrain.com/connect/substance-not-just-substances-in-addiction/) which i found trying to look at the behavior side of this. ..I wondered if anyone has read his books and what you think? ..Turns out i am struggling now with an addiction to "information". ..im spending so much time researching and having ahaaha moments - not a problem except when i know i forgot to put the bins out again because i was "researching" his book. Sigh. ..So doing the thing where i humbly ask for help and admit i have a problem. Tia.

I listened to the audiobook and while it's interesting I remember it being a bit esoteric felt unorganized and I had a hard time relating to the material but can see how it applies to addiction. That said it was still wildly informative and I would recommend it especially if you're an information junky.
