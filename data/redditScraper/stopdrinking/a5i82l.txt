**Great article by Laura Dolan:**  ...[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/thanks-i-dont-drink-laura-s-dolan-esq-/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/thanks-i-dont-drink-laura-s-dolan-esq-/)  ...* No thanks. I don't drink. *..The first time I said this to a business colleague they gave me a confused look. The second time I said it was to a group of business associates at dinner and someone asked me if I was pregnant. Seriously. Many people do not drink for a variety of reasons: religious observations health conscious nutrition gurus and the more obvious people in recovery. Sure many pregnant women abstain too. I quit drinking a little over a year ago because someone very important to me is in recovery. I made the decision to stand in solidarity with them before they even found sobriety not because I had to but because I wanted to find a small way to be part of the solution not the problem...I was surprised by how awkward it felt to utter those three little words to business colleagues particularly to anyone that works in the legal industry. Our dirty little secret (though thankfully no longer that big of a secret) is that a frighteningly high percentage of attorneys struggle with alcohol use and substance abuse disorders. A 2016 joint-study conducted by the ABA Commission on Lawyer Assistance Programs and the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation found that 20.6 percent of lawyers and judges who responded self-identified as problem drinkers. **A staggering 36.4 percent of those surveyed qualified as problem drinkers based on their questionnaire answers.** Perhaps an even more important finding from the 2016 study is that young attorneys are more susceptible to substance abuse and mental health disorders than older attorneys   a direct contradiction to the generally accepted understanding that senior attorneys were more likely to experience these difficulties...It is with this in mind that I think of my recent experiences with openly sharing with colleagues that I do not drink. Then I think of how difficult it might be for someone in recovery particularly a young attorney looking to fit into the firm culture say during a summer associate program. And yet year after year alcohol-fueled summer programs are celebrated lauded and encouraged throughout the top firms across the country. Nearly daily events and parties all of which seem to center around alcohol take center stage over more substantive programming. It seems to beg the question:..&gt;*Are we as an industry creating a self-fulfilling prophecy when it comes to alcohol use and substance abuse disorders?*..If we know that our colleagues are suffering many of them silently why do we insist upon perpetuating a culture that celebrates a work hard play hard mentality that statistical and scientific studies have shown correlates with and possibly directly leads to these very disorders? As we move into summer and bring in another crop of young impressionable and ambitious summer associates it seems it would behoove partners associates and administrative professionals to foster a culture of acceptance.  No one should feel uncomfortable at a firm event simply because they are concerned about how their not drinking may be perceived by those that hold the key to their first job out of law school. Firms should offer at least one program during their summer programs that focuses on attorney well-being and a transparent discussion about the importance of knowing the warning signs and of seeking help early. Every attorney and administrative professional has an opportunity to make a difference and create immediate and direct impact on this issue...So the next time someone at your firm tells you they don't drink or even that they don't want a drink that night don't pressure them. Don't make it awkward. A simple  that's cool  (or whatever the kids are saying these days) will suffice. Oh yeah - don't ask anyone if she is pregnant...For all you summer associates out there if a firm does not want to hire you simply because you skipped the Thursday night drinkathon in the fifth week of the summer program it's not the right firm for you anyway. And for any summer associates in recovery please know that there are many people who have been where you are now. You are absolutely not alone. Easy does it.

Good read!..Every industry I have worked in (UK) at some point someone has said to me: "Oh the culture of X industry (that we are in) is really bad for drinking"..NEWSFLASH FOLKS: All of Western culture is obsessed with drinking. 
Interesting article...It's noteworthy to me that the author felt awkward stating that she doesn't drink.  I think it's important to say that out loud because you never know who's listening and how it might affect them.  One of my coworkers refused alcohol about a year ago saying "No thanks I don't drink alcohol." She explained that she has to look after her health because of various reasons.  I found her statement empowering for myself. She set an example to me that it is okay to make your own self-care a priority.  For me that's a revelation.  I have drunk waaaay less in 2018 than in previous years for many reasons but her statement was one of them.

Thanks for sharing it was a good read. I'm looking forward to being able to confidently say I don't drink anymore in all situations. I'm not quite there yet but getting closer. 
Badass!! IWNDWYT  
I was just logging into check-in and read this. Happy to report I attended a annual holiday meeting last night attended only by attorneys. Of 12 there 4 had 1 drink and the rest just NA bevies. I was worried it would be hard to decline but I felt so pleased to be in such a healthy environment!
