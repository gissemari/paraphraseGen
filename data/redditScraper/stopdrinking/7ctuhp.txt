Hi ive never made a post before. Longtime lurker. Just wanted to say im here. And this is kinda some about how alcohol has impacted my life. ..I'm an alcoholic. I know this. I had to be put into the hospital November 2016 because detoxing was so bad I would have died. I had visual and auditory hallucinations. I was so far gone I couldn't give the nurse my correct information to be admitted. I lost control of my bowels and embarrassingly shit my self almost everyday I was in there. The doctors told me if I didn't stop drinking how I was I'd die in 5 years. I was just about to turn 26...I relapsed in April. Since then it's been touch and go. 7 days sober here relapse. I am now back to my day 1. ....
