Never made it past day 5 since the year began but in about 2 hours day 5 will be complete!  Went in the liquor store to pick up cigarettes.  Walked to the freezer and picked up some Reed's ginger beer La Croixs.  Took a quick stare at the real beer and said fuck you beer.  Walked home with the sound of glass bottles clanging and for once it wasn't beer that was kinda funny...I know it was risky to be even entering a liquor store I usually sabotage the days I've earned when I do that but today I was in control and it felt good.  ..I've relapsed many times already this year but I've learned from each one.  For you day 2-4'ers I feel ya stay strong and find the momentum to carry on.  Thanks for reading!
