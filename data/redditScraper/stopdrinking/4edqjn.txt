I'm OhanaE and I'm an alcoholic. It finally happened. I guess I saw it coming. They say you always mentally relapse before you physically do. It was starting to get really difficult after 40 days clean. Saturday night I ended up drinking again and got pretty fucked up. I've realized females are a huge trigger for me. I'm not going to let it get to me. I requested a badge change which i didn't think would bother me as much as it does. But I do have 2 days now so there's that. .(Edit: A word.)

What were some of the mental relapses that come to mind? Maybe your experience could help someone.
How are females a huge trigger?
Yes badge reset for me today too after 85 days and totally disappointing. All we can do is start over from here and get back to where we were! I am also going to try meetings and therapy this time around.
