I'm 34 and I'm struggling to remember what it's like to wake up without a hangover. I drink everyday and I want to stop. .It's 4am thoughts and anxiety whirling through my head. I found this site by accident.

Today is a perfect day to quit drinking! I will not drink with you today!
Welcome my friend! ..We've all been there. When asked why I quit my default answer has become "I got tired of waking up hungover." I won't say that quitting will magically fix all your problems but it absolutely gets rid of the haze and allows you to be more mindful of what the underlying issues really are. ..My other only comment is that if you are a very heavy drinker be careful if you want to go cold turkey. Alcohol withdrawal can be fatal so be aware of that do a little research if you haven't already and don't just try to tough it out if you start to feel very bad. Seek professional medical help if necessary. ..Best of luck and we'll be here if you ever need some help.
