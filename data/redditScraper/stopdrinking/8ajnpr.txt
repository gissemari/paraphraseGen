Hi Guys!..I got really sick of the unpredictable relapses and realized I can't do this on my own.  I got some Naltrexone from my doc which is working well to combat cravings.  ..I'm also planning on attending an AA meeting tonight- I'm pretty nervous.  I've been before but I didn't speak...Any tips for a first-timer?  Things I should know?

Try these links from the sidebar of r/alcoholism ..http://www.bma-wellness.com/papers/First_AA_Meeting.html..https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/2v573a/the_where_why_and_what_should_i_expect_at_my/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=alcoholism&amp;utm_content=t5_2rgl1..
I know that you are nervous. Many people are but lets think this through.  You are taken action to better your life. Nothing to be nervous about. ..I don't know what type of meeting you are going to but you don't have to share if you don't want to.  If you feel pressured to speak up but don't want to share just say introduce yourself and say "I'm new. I just want to listen". However expect some friendly people to come up to you after and introduce themselves to you. 
The protocol for a new person in AA is to go a little early introduce yourself help make coffee. As people come in introduce yourself to them. They in turn will introduce themselves to you. ..My dad was a teacher he told me that if you want to learn sit up front and listen.  So I'd sit close to the front. No need to say anything they will ask if there is anyone at their first AA meeting. Introduce yourself. No need to say  I am an alcoholic . That might take some time to say. ..Listen to the readings try to hear what they say. Talk if you want to. Listen for the similarities. At some point you will be offered a 24 hour chip. Might be metal might be a white poker chip depending on where you live. Take it. Put it in your pocket. Touch it often. ..Go to more meetings. Take more chips if your resolve isn't the strongest. ..They will say keep coming back it works if you work it. ..That's what I did and it has worked for 4+ years. ..Good luck. IWNDWYT 
Hi! I just came to that conclusion myself recently. If you have someone go with you that supports you that might be helpful. My sister came with me and that's all that would get my butt through that door. I found the fear was a bit unfounded but it was still scary. ..Also definitely helpful for me to read online what a meeting might be like beforehand! There's another recent post that tapped into some good info on the sidebar (I don't know how to link).
