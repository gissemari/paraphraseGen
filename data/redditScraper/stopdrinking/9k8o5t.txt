Hullo all..It was a tough week. I felt very depressed and anxious for most of it but the worst seems to be wearing off. I'm proud of myself for not numbing my negative emotions with alcohol and for riding them out. My two big wins during these 7 days were:..1) I went to the gym. I'm super unfit so it was a very short workout with light weights but whatever I went! I will go again tomorrow. ..2) I played some live music sober for the first time in my entire life. This was something that I always thought I'd struggle with. My main hobby is playing live music out and about in the city I live in (a real easy scene to end up abusing alcohol and other drugs in). But I played completely sober and I played well. ..I've got a lot going on in my life this year which is going to be very difficult and one very big personal decision to make. But I know attempting to drown out those problems with IPA and whiskey isn't going to help. I need a very clear confident self reliant mind to make the best out of everything. ..I know it's a big goal but I've committed myself to one full year of t-totalism (I may break this to take acid but I don't do so lightly it's a very spiritual and healing experience for me that I usually only do once a year in a very controlled meditative setting haven't decided whether I'll do that this year). ..I just owe it to myself to see what kind of life I'm missing out on. Sober healthy peaceful. ..Much love to this sub I'm going to try and be much more active in it and less of a lurker from now on xxx
