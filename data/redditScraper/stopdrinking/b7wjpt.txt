Yes lol for me at least 
Happens to a lot of people. This isn't necessarily applicable to you but a relapse can deepen the sense of shame and despair that triggers and maintains drinking behavior. The inner critic that's so strong in many of us has new ammunition to throw at us: *I've already failed. I threw away everything I'd gained. I built myself a shrine and then I burned it to the ground. I'll never be able to build it again.*..Of course the truth is that we don't lose everything we've gained when we relapse. That's not how growth works. It's more like looking at the stock market graph: over a sufficient period of time any dip in performance starts to look insignificant when compared with the upward trajectory...What's the old saying? Two steps forward one step back.
yes it is for me. I think when I relapse I think it'll be for just a day or two so I may as well "go all out" or something stupid like that 
So what happens to me is I enjoy the second time more than the first time when I relapse. The first time is disappointing and boring and I feel bad that I gave up for this. And then the second time I'm back in my groove and do a serious session maybe a few hours of wine or something. And then if I don't overdo it that night I'm primed for the next time because then I'm trying to get that same fun buzz which must be because it feels new again so then I spend the next uncountable times just chasing that and getting drunk consecutively back in a horrible psychotic lifestyle back to not eating staying up until 4 am shakes anxiety depression the whole 9 yards. That lasts until I can get the courage to take a break again sometimes a month sometimes three months but never just after a couple days or a week.
