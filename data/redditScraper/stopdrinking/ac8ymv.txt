I'm on day 4 today.  Last week I went a full 8 days my longest stretch yet then slipped up and had to start over.  I went to an AA meeting today mostly full of people who were 15 20 30 years sober.  A few had 1 or 2 years.  I just want to get to that point already.  I want to be one of those people who can say that they have a year or 2 or 3 sober and can look back and appreciate all the positive changes that have happened for them.  But I'm struggling with the feeling of how slowly it comes.  I know it's wrong to think this way but I want that change to come sooner.  I don't want to have to struggle through Day 5 then Day 6 then Day 7 and so on.  I know it's like losing weight or growing a beard you don't see the change happening day to day but slowly over time it changes and when you look back you're able to see it after time.  ..&amp;#x200B;..I don't like it but I'm thankful that I slipped up and had to start over after the 8 days.  Now I know what it feels like to have to start the clock over for something that could have been so easily avoided.  I could have powered through those 3 nights and by now I'd have 2 weeks to be proud of.  So now I have extra motivation to keep going day to day and realize it's not worth it for just one night of drinking.  I'm going to stay on the path and look forward to being able to look back and be proud of a whole month 6 months a year and more and more.  I'm still hurting from a lot of things but I'll take it one day at a time and I won't drink with you all today.

Yup. Just focus on today my friend. I saw on here a few days ago that it doesn't matter how long we've been on the road we are all the same distance from the ditch. IWNDWYT 
I remember thinking last year at this time that if I stopped drinking then at this time next year I would have a year without drinking. And here we are! It does not seem long at all and the crazy thing is I don't even remember what it is like to want a drink. Like many of the wise folks on here I just chose not to drink each day. Good luck on your journey. IWNDWYT.
