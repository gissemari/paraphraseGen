I'm not sure if my body is "coming down" from how heavily I've been drinking recently or if this worn down feeling is a result of how I've mentally built up quitting alcohol. I'm 2 days in after realizing that I am a binge drinker nearing a tipping point in my alcoholism. I don't really know how to moderate anymore. Shame causes me to drink as much as I can when I'm alone because I worry that I won't be able to sneak more when I'm with other people including my husband. Also I only drink straight vodka or whiskey because I want to get drunk faster. .I took a picture of my bruised legs a few days ago because I need a future reminder of how embarrassing it is to fall/get hurt without any memory of the event. The worst nights are when I wake up at 2am and vaguely remember some type of verbal fight with my husband before I blacked out. When I'm trying to piece together what I said or did I feel so far away from him it breaks my heart. That happened multiple times last week and I dont know why I can't just learn from mistakes. I have a great job (I never drink before work only after + weekends) and supportive people in my life. I work with kids and it's terrifying to imagine parents knowing what my nights are like even though I am professional and responsible at work. I don't want to lose any of the good things in my life but I don't know how this path is going to progress. I'm 29 and feel very isolated because I don't personally know women my age who struggle with alcohol this way...But I'm trying like all of you guys and I'm hopeful. I feel fuzzy and tired today but at least I feel something and I'm awake instead of passed out. Sorry for rambling but I'm not ready to talk to my family or friends about this so beyond my husband this is my first safe place. Thank you all for inspiring me to try. I'm not drinking with you tonight.
