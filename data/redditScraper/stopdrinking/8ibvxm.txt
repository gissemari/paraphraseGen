Welcome aboard!..The good news is *we* get it.....Sorry to hear about what you've been through but I'm glad you lived to tell the tale.....It's very common for folks to stop for a while convince themselves that they're fine and start drinking again... it's back down the slippery slope before you can say 'Oh Bugger'! I find that a bit of vigilance against that thinking and speaking regularly to other folks in recovery really helps......Hope you'll stick around and keep us posted!..I won't drink with you today ..Woody :&gt;)&gt; 
Welcome friend    
Hi there and welcome   
Welcome! We'd love to have you. What you went through sounds really scary. I'm glad you're doing better. The good news is that you don't have to go through something like that ever again. 
Welcome. AA saved my ass when I was in your shoes. There are other programs out there now. Check out the sidebar to all the major recovery programs. AA has women's meetings and there is one called Women For Sobriety (WFS). Good luck. ..IWNDWYT
