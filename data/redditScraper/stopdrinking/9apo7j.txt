I have been battling with alcoholism for ten plus years after giving up a drug addiction. I've been to rehab once but it didn't  stick  after a messy divorce and moving across the country I picked up the habit in full force. Six months ago my boyfriend and I find out his brother also has a pretty serious drinking problem so much so he has lost his job and seen a rabid decline in his health. So his brother and I both battled our disease for the next six months and the only difference is only my boyfriend knew the extent of my problems while the family was very aware of his. Last night we got the dreaded call at a young age his brother was found unresponsive pronounced dead an hour later. We go to his parents to be with them I see all this pain and confusion in his parents and my heart aches. Fuck this disease. My boyfriend asked me when we were settling down for bed if I'll ever stop. I have to I feel like but for the grace of whatever deity exists that could have been me. I don't really know what else to say we are all kind of numb right now just needed to share. I'll be checking in a lot I can't relapse again and will need the support.
