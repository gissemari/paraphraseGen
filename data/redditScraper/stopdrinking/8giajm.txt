Today's rough. Ran out of booze. Feeling foggy. Want to get another pint but can't bring myself to walk these miles and ran the car down so I can't drive. Hope that god everyone likes to talk about can keep me today while I struggle not to pick up again. This sub is great. Please don't repeat the experiment guys and gals. I'll tell ya it didn't get any better down here in hell.

This title is fabulous. Do what you gotta do! 
Hang in there Pineapple. ..I won't drink with you today. 
Do whatever you have to do to stay out of that car when you've been drinking. Good job recognizing the danger. 
Whatever's going on I wish you strength. We're here. I'm sorry you're down at the moment. Hang tough.
