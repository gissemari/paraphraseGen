111 days ago I stopped drinking. ..I was "high-functioning" for a while until I wasn't. Then things got scary. Nightly blackouts. Tried drowning myself. Hoped for someone to murder me. Should've died. Got sober relapsed. Sober relapsed. Again and again and again. Learned something new each time. Became more desperate each time. Finally something clicked. I saw the damage and it frightened me. I realized I didn't want to die...I feel like I've woken up from a dream. I am still healing and will be for a while but it feels good to not want to die. It feels good to be alive...Thank you to everyone on this sub. You help keep me sober.
