I'm going to be at a wedding with a great friend who understands. I'm not worried I just feel the need to post because a lot today I had the "OMG it's almost Friday I can drink tomorrow." thoughts. I quickly hushed them but I realized how much easier it is for me on the week to keep on track rather than the weekend. I also didn't realize how much alcohol was everywhere. Every show and movie. Everywhere I go...I'm also still struggling with forgiving myself and loving myself. I've started meditating and I love it. All of my friends in my apartment complex just moved out which will give me more time to do this and focus on myself...Anyway just an update. Thanks for being here. Your stories keep me strong everyday when I feel weakness. Keep it up guys.

That's great keep with it!..Do you have any online resources as to where one might start to enter the world of meditation? It's always appealed to me but I never really knew where to start. 
Hey there fellow Day 4 veteran! I've been thinking about the upcoming weekend as well. Usually I spend most of Saturday afternoon cooking for the week---while drinking of course. For some reason this seems like one of the more daunting tasks to get through sober. ..Yeah I hear you about alcohol being everywhere. I heard an ad for Angry Apple hard cider on the radio this morning... at 6 AM! Way to start the day!..Great that you've found calm in meditating. Keep on going.
