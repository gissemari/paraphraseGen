[In this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgF1fzCqu-k) Richard Burton speaks candidly about his alcohol abuse with Dick Cavett in an era when there were fewer resources and outreach for those fighting their demons & addictions...If you are struggling over the holiday season please know you are not alone. If you are a lurker and trying to figure out if you need help see if Richard Burton's words resonate with you. If you are a person painfully trying to support someone who suffers from alcohol dependency this video may give you an additional window of empathy.

Thank you. I have been devouring videos on youtube about this subject. Even some really annoying reality show videos about addiction... They all keep my guard up.
Did he stay sober? I remember he was a notorious alcoholic even by the standards of his profession and the era.
Awesome video - what an eloquent way to describe alcoholism and recovery. I've added it to [SD's video resources page](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/video)!
Thank you for posting. The boxing metaphor is so true. 
Wow...to think this was made back in the '70s when having a beer or a couple shots at lunch was still very acceptable and alcoholism wasn't really as well known. .."Oh he just drinks a lot" a century ago...the person may have gone into what we now call DT's if he didn't.
