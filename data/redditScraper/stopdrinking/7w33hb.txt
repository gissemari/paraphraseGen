It's been rough for me. I feel like giving up. I already relapsed

Start again right now. You can do this one hour one day at a time. You are only a quitter if you quit for good. Right now you are a relasper who wants to stop drinking and you can do it! Please don't think of yourself as a quitter (unless it's quitting alcohol) think of yourself as a relasper whose relapses will get farther and farther apart. Please stay engaged and reading this sub for help. Consider a sponsor good friend partner who can help you pick yourself up and carry forward.
Practice makes perfect!!! One day at a time my friend.....**IWNDWYT.**
I fell down nine times   got up ten and here I am.  You haven't failed all the time you're still trying.  How about not drinking with me today? 
Every day you don't drink is a victory and a step in the right direction! If it was easy there wouldn't be so many of us here  like others have commented you are only a quitter if you stop trying. I tried to quit for years making it one or two days (at most) at a time and then giving up for months. Just One day at a time. Let's not drink today. 
I was gonna say. Being a quitter was the best thing I have ever done! As in quitting alcohol. ..Remember this the road to sobriety often is not a straight and narrow path. There are bumps and twists and turns. Sometimes we even run into dead ends have to make a U turn and back track a bit. Don't take a relapse as a sign that you weren't meant for sobriety. You are learning right now what works and what doesnt. It takes time
