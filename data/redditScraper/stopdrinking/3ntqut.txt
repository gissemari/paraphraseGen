[HUMP DAAAAAYYYYYY!](http://www.quickmeme.com/img/e7/e7b2c77f90a120e30f6b2665409d23601ad30c7cf44d342898cd333df9a22bbc.jpg)..Hey guys!! Hey guys!! [Happy Wednesday!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs5QJi-dX-4) Let's hump it out on this happy day! Hump days are when we calibrate our sobriety check in see how our /sd buds are doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations in the format below...**Triumph**: I'm on an upswing with my exercise plan. I'm doing a big race soon and I've set a personal goal that I think will be achievable. Running in cold weather is really different from running in warm/hot weather and I've forgotten how much I enjoy it. One of the things I've heard a lot of us say is that now that we're sober we can recognize and enjoy the transition from one season to another in ways we never could before. I'm getting a kick out of the leaves changing! ..**Struggle**: So maybe like you one of my harmful behaviors when drinking was buying expensive crap online. It was stuff I didn't really want and would never use and the dresses and shoes hung in my closet as accusatory reminders of my embarrassing mistakes. I think I probably kept them around to punish myself. I was cleaning out my closets this weekend and actually had to go through and acknowledge dresses I'll never wear that still had the ridiculous price tags and shoes that are inappropriate for pretty much anything and have never been worn. It sucked to have to deal with all of it. I put it all in bags for Goodwill even leaving the tags on. The thought of someone coming across the dresses and shoes and being happy about them makes me smile. So I guess that's a struggle turned into a triumph?..**General Chat**: What's something you're looking forward to as we move into fall (or spring for you southerers)? I'm a big fan of snuggling up under blankets so I've brought out my favorites and am making sure they're clean and good-smelling and ready for some hot cider and [PB&J-accompanied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8MDNFaGfT4) binge reading. ..More important how are you guys doing? How has this week been for you? Let us know your triumphs and struggles!

YAY!  Sorry girl one of yorr links got this stuck in the mod queue...
**Triumph:**  My kid sister survived her open heart surgery giving heart to her family and friends who love her to pieces;..**Struggle:** Still struggling with physical setbacks in my recovery from bicycle injuries although I can now see my left ankle bone for the first time in a while:..**Chat:** Raking leaves and listening to my iPod stuffed with new tunes; catching up with some long unwatched acclaimed films; and the fall holidays with my now almost 5 year old grandson who is totally into everything.
I love the share about your dresses and shoes. It is amazing the things we think are great purchases while ripped. (I only wanted two songs did I *need* the entire Steve Winwood album??) As you said your donation is going to make someone very very happy!..**T**: I'm not sure where it came from but after three years of slacking off at work and wishing for a nervous breakdown *just* so I could have a valid excuse to drop out of life I have somehow acquired a new enthusiasm to be productive. I'm getting much more done than I have in a long time and I feel really good about myself again in that regard. Being the only one knowing I haven't been pulling my own weight has made me very disappointed in myself and was another thing I was trying to escape by drinking. ..**S**: My husband developed a fast moving ear infection that turned into mastoiditis in less than a week. He's off work for the second week now. I'm worried about the bills yes because that's two pay checks we'll be shy this month at a time that is like a sucker punch to the gut. But even more so I have to keep my fears at bay that it could really turn into something worse and I'm scared for him. He's showing marked improvement since the weekend but it's really slow. I'm used to seeing him bull his way through physical limitations but this time he's allowing himself proper recovery (which is good!) which tells me he had a good scare too. He doesn't scare easy and that's scary to me. It's better though I just have to be patient. ..**G**: I absolutely dread winter but LOVE autumn. The smells colors air... fabulous! I hope it sticks around longer than usual this year ;)
**Triumph:** Well I'm here and I'm at a point in my life where I saw I needed to make a change and took action. That is a big triumph. I'm also travelling the world and am currently in the Netherlands. I am so thankful for my current opportunity to broaden my horizons and worldview...**Struggle:** Well all of this is quite new. I am in Europe and when I did drink I was a fan of European beer so temptation is quite strong. Also I am kinda figuring out how this will fit into my life and how I will tell people I don't drink and what to say if they ask why. Adjustment periods can be difficult but they are worth it...**General:** Two things: I freaking hate the DraftDuel and FanKings commercials everywhere. I know that some guy in Arizona (probably) with complicated algorithms and stuff will beat me and take my money so I don't bother. Please get outlawed like poker so I can quit being bombarded by your ads..Second: I listen to lot of podcasts and it seems like most are sponsored by the same 10 companies. MeUndies need more eggs in their basket than just advertising on podcasts. I can't see your undies through my ipod.
**Triumph:** Feeling excited about making art again.  I have today and tomorrow off to just spend cutting up paper and gluing it back together.  I have time off with no other pressing business  and a huge house one room dedicated entirely to my collage making madness.  Realizing this I am very lucky and in a good position in life.  Feeling gratitude for my position in life more regularly is my triumph...**Struggle:** I am starting to get sick.  Throat is itchy and I'm worried to start feeling worse. I hate being sick I turn into a huge baby. It's a hazard of my job being exposed to illness especially with kids who don't wash their hands or cover their faces as they are expelling germs all over the place.  Annnnnd it's another reason I want a new job.  ..**General Chat:** I'm sorry I'm going to say it: Pumpkin Flavored Everything.  I'm a white girl I'm not ashamed and I will drink my pumpkin flavored coffee and tea all fucking day. 
**Triumph**: faced my fears and attended a social event that meant meeting ex-colleagues...**Struggle**: Not sure how to let go of past failure...**Chat**: TIL In the UK  cider is solely used for the  alcoholic  drink made from  apples (US hard cider); in the US cider is just juice from  crushed  apples (UK apple juice).
**Triumph:** Had a great vacation. Surviving being slammed and stressed at work. Not quite duck-like but doing pretty good...**Struggle:** Buried at work and will be for the next few weeks. Traveling for work for 10 days of intense meetings and training. Will have to be well stocked on La Croix to get through the evenings with everyone. I'm also missing my in-person meetings for three weeks straight...**Chat:** Caught the [peak of aspen](http://i.imgur.com/TyLzeQv.jpg) on vacation. Stunning even snapped through the car window. Fall also means [dark storms and golden light](http://i.imgur.com/QFsIL60.jpg).
**Triumph:** I'm off work tomorrow and Friday for an extra-long Thanksgiving weekend!..**Struggle:** I've been to 4 grocery stores now and can't find fresh sage... my turkey stuffing depends on it...**General Chat:** My wife and I are going to Patagonia in December to hike. We've been talking about doing this for a long time so I'm really looking forward to it!
