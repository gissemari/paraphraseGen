48+ hours in and I've been feeling AMAZING for two days. But I had the worst most upsetting nightmares all night last night. Woke up in tears and wrote in my journal which made me feel a lot better but I'm still unsettled. I know it's the withdrawal that did it and I'm trying to use that to strengthen my resolve to not drink. What an awful drug to have done that to me. ..I'm also struggling with my feeling of pride for making it two days. I know it's a huge step for a daily drinker and my body and mind already feel better but I'm... embarrassed somehow? Or dissappointed in myself that 48 hours is such a huge feat. I know it's ridiculous to feel that way but I can't help it. I'll be working on getting over that today...Thanks for being here guys :)

be proud of every milestone. you deserve it. sorry about the nightmares. hoping you get some good sleep tonight.
Every day you got without drinking is a success. For a normal person it may not be such a big deal but for a drinker like me that's huge! The first week was hell for me but it keeps getting easier. Keep it up!
The nightmares are the worst but it will get better with each day.  One day at a time.  I will not drink with you today:)
oh my god! THIS was the worst part about withdrawal i could white knuckle most of the symptoms but the nightmares are worse then a horror film. ..anytime I relapse I make sure you i get benzos for a few days and this usually alleviates the problem. And then after a few days you're body stops going through withdrawal and you go back to having a normal sleep. ..This isn't medical advise consult a doctor with your issues and see what they say.
