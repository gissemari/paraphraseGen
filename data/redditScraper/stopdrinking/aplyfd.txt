150 "One day at a time" moments.   150 hangover free mornings.  From 6-12+ beers everyday and pushing 185 pounds.   I am now down to 160 or a touch less.  I only hope that I can add to reasons to stop drinking.   Folks this can be done.   Thank you to everyone here for sharing the struggles and accomplishments.  IWNDWYT
