Started off with the physical withdrawals now I'm struggling with the thoughts and temptations of having a drink or two. I'm supposed to golf with coworkers after work today and I'm sure they'll be drinking. I'm sure I can make it without having a drink; I'm actually more nervous about trying to have fun without drinking. For a long time now I've lived with the mindset that I can only have fun socializing when there's alcohol involved. I'm almost tempted to not golf later but I think I need to force myself to hang out and learn that I don't need alcohol to have a good time.

This is perfectly normal. I personally took a few weeks to get my head straight before I went back to places with temptations. It takes 10 days for alcohol to leave the body. Can I suggest reading up on the effects of alcohol like the book this Naked Mind or kick the drink by Jason vale. I needed to change my thinking around alcohol before I stopped
