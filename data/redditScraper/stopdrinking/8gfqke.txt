I'm really struggling tonight. And I've already given in and have almost polished off 375ml of bourbon. I know if I drink any more tonight I will either feel nauseous all morning or full on vomit. I'm annoyed because I don't even feel drunk just gross. I felt a little tipsy earlier but it was short lived. ..Three months ago I could've easily destroyed almost an entire 750ml bottle of whiskey ...  my life changed drastically (a result of my drinking + anxiety/depression) and I guess I've been cutting back without really realizing it. I don't have a source of income right now I am fully relying on the help of my mom while I figure out my meds/financial situation. ..She is too good to me I feel like a monster. She just retired but decided a few weeks ago to pick up 10 hours of work a week to support us both. I feel like trash because she has been funding my alcoholism with no complaints. She shouldn't have to work at all; I suck. I guess the only saving grace in my mind is that I have been buying less booze because I hate that I'm doing this to her...I stopped drinking for four days around the 24th April. On the fifth day I bought a 375ml bottle of bourbon I don't even know why. I was feeling great leading up to the purchase. Almost killed the entire bottle that night stopped just short of it. Left myself about a shot for the following day. ..Surprisingly after that I didn't feel the need to continue drinking. I felt sick following that first night and I noticed my body felt heavy and weak compared to the few days of sobriety i had just experienced. Prior to this I don't think I have gone more than one day in two years without drinking 5+ shots a night...Went another day without drinking. .Came up to visit my dad today (technically yesterday) and I was feeling good about everything. Made plans to go job hunting tomorrow. As I approached the city nearest to him I started getting really hungry and thinking about food. I don't eat meat and (most) dairy so I thought I'd hit up the local health food store for a few groceries for myself. Then I realized I'd forgotten to transfer some money my mom gave me to the correct account and I have no internet on my phone to access my bank. My dad lives 30 miles away from the nearest grocery so it wouldn't be worth the gas to go there transfer the money and then drive back to the grocery store. I decided to take my chances and see what my dad had to eat. ..BUT at some point along the drive I got it in my head that I would hit up the local restaurant near his house and grab some French fries. Soon that thought turned into French fries and a shot   no a double. To make a long story short the restaurant was closed so I went to the local general store only to discover they sell alcohol. Which brings me to where I am now with my bottle of whiskey. Wtf addict brain?!..I think I really just needed to write all this out apologies for my ramblings. I feel more confident now. I can do this. this is the beginning to the end of my drinking. ..Thanks for having me!

Glad you are here. Come on back later on when you haven't been drinking and stay a while. This is hard we know and certainly understand. 
We're glad that you're here and still looking for support. We do have to remove this post as you admit drinking tonight. From our FAQ:..&gt;Post only while sober...&gt;We recognize that many people spend months "lurking" this subreddit while drinking. You are welcome to read as much as you'd like while not sober. However for the sake of everyone here and for the sake of your own recovery please only post or comment when you're sober. "Sober" means "not currently intoxicated or under the influence in any way."
