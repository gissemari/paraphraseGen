Today my 2.5 yr old twins are being insane. Multiple potty accidents very difficult (yay terrible twos) and lots of crying. On top of that my husband is in a horrible mood because the boys are stressing him out and he just needs a break. But sadly a lot of that is directed at me. I just want to sit outside and drink a whole bottle of wine by myself and wallow in my self pity. I can't see any downsides to being sober right now.

Playing the tape forward helped me get through times when picking up a drink seemed like my only option...Stay on the path my friend.
Congratulations on a week! I won't drink with you tonight.
Just a guess but I think the downside is you probably know better and saying fuck it isn't a great plan. This'll pass stay strong good luck.
Ugh sounds rough. but your Alkie brain is trying to trick you  claiming you aren't resilient enough to get through the day. but you are and tomorrow you'll see your 1 week badge!
Oh my goodness those first couple of weeks are rough no matter what is going on in your life. You will make it through and it does get so much better and easier...Break on through to the other side! You won't regret it. 
I have twins too. It's very very hard sometimes. Lots of stress lots of demands. It's ok in my opinion to put a little tv show on for them and step away to sit quietly by yourself. Actually sit down drink some seltzer water eat a snack. It does get easier. I promise I will not drink with you today. 
Thanks for the support everyone. I ended up going to Target after I put the kids to bed and just some time alone really helped. I managed to resist the temptation. This is literally a day by day process!
