Hello everybody It's weird to be here. I never thought I would actually be a person with an alcohol problem and I'm still not even sold on the fact that I am. Its hard to see through the cloudy self-deception. I feel that reality gets muddled by my justifications. ..So lets start with an intro... I am a 21 year old college student. I have a girlfriend of 4 years now and the same friends i've had since childhood/early teenage years. They are my best-friends. We have been through thick and thin raising hell together for years. I started dating my girlfriend in my junior year of high school. She's always been very against substance abuse of any kind be it alcohol marijuana... all things I was fond of from the start. But I'd hidden those things from her so I would have a chance. Well those things eventually made their way into our conversations. And she actually accepted my moderate alcohol and pot consumption holy shit she still accepts me! One problem I lied about it being moderate...Well I'm learning now that hiding things is never good especially in a long-term relationship. ..My buddies have always been the guys that I drink and smoke with. It wasn't always like that but as we started dabbling together it became the norm...I've always been paranoid about her meeting my degenerate friends who i've been contemplating drifting apart from anyway due to recent events (drunk driving accidents continued drinking on probation always getting sucked into their shit ect...). But she really wants to meet them now. ..We had a long discussion about how our relationship couldn't grow without her meeting my buddies. Well I don't want her around what we've become; enablers not friends. And I don't want her to see my friends as a reflection of myself because that simply isn't the case. My foot is out the door. I should have never let it get this far...But now that my foot is out the door i'm left with my own struggles. Since school started I've been drinking like a madman. I feel that drinking helps me quiet my inner perfectionist long enough to write coherent thoughts that yield high grades. I lie to my girlfriend about what I'm doing usually drinking and doing jack-shit. And get this I don't even know if I'm happy in the relationship. Maybe its irreparable. I don't know but its a contribution to my downward spiral...Anyway I'm freaking out because i'm changing from my friends. I don't drink and drive; that behavior is beginning to disgust me. I don't want her to think that I'm like them even if I have been before. I'm trying to change and leave the lifestyle but I'm now left with the repercussions from it - a drinking problem...I know this is a long rant but if I could get some advice from someone who has gone through a similar situation that would be great. And how do you let go of people who you care for like brothers?

You must do the right thing for you.  If they are like brothers that really care about you then they will understand your desire to not screw up the rest of your life with a drinking problem.  Set the example.  It's never easy being the leader......But it will save your life and maybe theirs too!
I didn't have to true brothers will be there regardless. I told one of my best mates I'm not drinking (he loves it especially high grade scotch) and the first thing he said was "that's okay how about we do something that doesn't involve drinking? It's probably better for me anyway". He suggested going for a ride or something so like iwantsobriety said maybe you must lead the way for them OR don't lead butt hey will accept you for you. Only you can make this choice...One thing I find a bit contradictory is you said in your title you're accepting your alcoholism and then you qualify it by saying you don't know if you have a problem... so which is it? I thikn there's a survey somewhere in the links to the right or if not you will find it online. But hiding your consumption is a sure good start...I hope you hang around and if you dont' give up at least you may find some good tools to moderate... but we are a giving up group as we've all lost too much to it.
