I need to stop drinking. I want to stop drinking. I want to lead an alcohol free life committed to being the best version of myself &amp; hoping to achieve my full potential. To be kind and patient with others. To be fully engaged in life and those around me. To be in the constant pursuit of excellence instead of just good enough or what I can get away with. To not cheat myself and to be honest and authentic with others...I have struggled with my drinking for a long time. I have had many failed attempts at getting sober. And today is what I hope will be my last day 1...I won't drink today. Good luck to everyone else in their personal battles against alcohol.
