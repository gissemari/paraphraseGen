*Apologies for the long post ahead &amp; poor punctuation*..New to Reddit.  Not new to wanting to get sober.  Every month I say  this is going to be a sober month' &amp; without fail I slip.  October was supposed to sober October.  .Life in general has been a battle but this year in particular has been the most challenging.  .My heavy drinking started back in 2015 when I found out my wife was cheating on me and I left her.  My anxiety doesn't allow me to eat so I drank instead..Since 2015 I've had some type of drink every day.  Sometimes just one a lot of times many.  .I had a full month of sobriety in August 2017 but went back to my usual once September hit.  .January 31st this year my ex fianc  (who was/is also a black out drunk) tried to kill me one night after a poker night out at the bar.  He snapped knocked me out with 4 blows to the head &amp; I only came too long enough to hear him say  how's it feel to die bitch  as he choked me while on top of me with me pinned to the floor.  SOMEHOW I managed to grab a statue that fell next to us and hit him hard enough to get away.  .I started finding reasons to start drinking earlier in the day every day.  I was numb - I couldn't handle existing.  .Now I can't get through a day without coming up with any and every reason to drink.  Thankfully I haven't gotten to the point of drinking before work but I can't say I haven't started my days off with alcohol..I'm so sick of this prison but it's still not enough.  So glad I found this community.  I'm hoping with every story I read somewhere I'll find my own strength one day soon.  I can't talk openly to any friends about this because I'm ashamed of always failing each time I try to get sober.  .Much love to all of you out there going through the same struggles.

I'm sorry it's hard and that you have been through so much. Hugs to you on your journey.
If you are struggling to quit have you looked at your progress in reduction?  I tried to quit for two years and if you look at that time in terms of complete abstinence I was a miserable failure because I could only get 1-3 week runs of complete abstinence.  But if you looked at my overall consumption I was making great strides.  In the first year I reduced my consumption by more than 50%.  With any other problem that would be seen as good progress.  And I cut it down even more in the second year.  Eventually I did figure out the key to complete abstinence but only after I stopped beating myself up about being an endless failure and started with the positive mental outlook that I was actually making progress despite the slip ups.  Perfection can take a long time to figure out but that doesn't mean your life can't get better in the meantime.  Welcome and I wish you the best.
Your story has a lot of parallels to mine. My drinking got very bad in 2015.  I had a verbally and emotionally abusive wife who I divorced in 2016.  I did not think I could get sober. I thought alcohol would beat me...Joining this community saved me.  There is hope.  I had never made it more than 13 days before coming here. Now I'm at 225 days sober.  You can do this. I believe in you.  I found peace and freedom that I had never known in sobriety.  By taking it one day at a time and getting help my life is on the right path again...Best wishes to you ! IWNDWYT 
Oh wow. That's a lot for anyone to deal with. I'm so sorry.  This community has been the biggest influence in my sobriety.  I would not be sober right now without it. We're here for you.   
Great info thanks I will take this to heart and work in it.  Sounds like this is something I can do!  Have a great rest of the weekend!
