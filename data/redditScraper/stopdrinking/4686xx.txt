I've posted this stuff on the brain and alcohol before but I think it's helpful to revisit it from time to time to fully understand the real impacts of drinking abstinence and relapse. These are snippets from various journal articles I have read edited to make the more readable. Enjoy!..*****..**WHAT HAPPENS WITH PROLONGED EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION?**..In general alcoholics show significant volume loss in cortical and subcortical brain structures that includes both gray and white matter shrinkage. These widespread deficits occur in the absence of major nutritional deficiencies although nutritional deficiencies can cause neurodegeneration and could contribute to alcoholic degeneration. Both postmortem and in vivo imaging studies of brain morphology find abnormal reduced brain volumes of gray and white matter across multiple regions. The frontal lobes are the most insulted region in the alcoholic brain with the superior frontal cortex showing significant neuronal loss. The frontal lobes regulate complex cognitive skills such as working memory temporal ordering discrimination and reversal learning that underlie judgment attention risk taking motivation mood and wanting. **Disorders in these behaviors are central if not causal to the consumption of dangerous amounts of alcohol despite the knowledge of negative consequences.** Accordingly chronic alcoholics demonstrate impaired judgment blunted affect poor insight social withdrawal reduced motivation distractibility attention and impulse-control deficits...**WHAT HAPPENS WITH LONG-TERM SOBRIETY?**..Human studies provide substantial evidence that sobriety results in improvement during abstinence. Studies have found improvement in component processes of nonverbal memory visuospatial abilities attention as well as gait and balance within months of sobriety. Longitudinal neuroimaging studies of brain structure find increases in cortical gray matter volume within 1 month of sobriety followed by increases in white matter and reversal of ventricular enlargement with longer abstinence. **Very long abstinence has been reported to resolve most neurocognitive deficits associated with alcoholism.** Recent studies have found associations between the recovery of memory and lateral ventricle shrinkage and the recovery of ataxia and fourth ventricle shrinkage. Thus in general studies suggest that recovery of function during abstinence is associated with ultrastructural changes in brain that include growth of both white and gray matter as well as improved overall function...**WHAT ABOUT A RELAPSE?**..Brain tissue volume gains are lost with alcoholism relapse. Humans who relapse do not show recovery of brain volume or cognitive abilities consistent with recovery of brain function and anatomy contributing to successful recovery from dependence. In the relapsers lifetime consumption of alcohol predicted later vulnerability to white matter volume decline and third ventricular enlargement with resumption of drinking. Resumption of drinking after a short period of abstinence arrests third ventricular volume improvement and produces white matter volume loss (Pfefferbaum 1995)...In their analysis of the 13-month data they separated those alcoholics who had maintained abstinence during the 13 months from those who had resumed drinking (albeit at a reduced level). They found that the abstainers had improved in learning memory abstracting and problem-solving and verbal abilities whereas the intermittent resumers had improved only in verbal abilities. **These results show that alcoholics who resume drinking even at a reduced level do not achieve the same gains in cognitive function as their abstinent peers** and that even abstinent alcoholics do not fully recover their cognitive abilities after 13 months. (Fein 1990)..To state it clearly cell death occurs during intoxication so a binge relapse in early sobriety will be a huge set back...

Thank you for posting this information.  It is very helpful in understanding the physiological reasons for continuing sobriety.  Maybe post this in the FAQs section?  
Thanks for this eye opening post GF. My own experience shows that you can undo a lot of damage by stopping the poison intake. My liver bounced back as well as blood pressure and cholesteral levels. That said my memory is pretty shitty. How much of that is alcohol and other drugs damage is all speculation at this point but I am sure I would have been better off to stop a hell of a lot sooner.
Really like this post.  I like understanding why our bodies crave alcohol the way it does. A good book that goes into this quite a bit is ( Healing the Addicted Brain ). It is nice that our bodies can heal slowly if we allow it to. 
Great read thanks for the editing. ..Looks like it's going to be a long journey!
Thanks I love reading stuff like this and wish there was more of it around!
Thank you this is really interesting information. .I will look into it myself too as this is the sort of thing that may stop me relapsing. I am concerned that once I have been sober for a sustained period of time feel as though I have healed and have 'everything under control' I will convince myself that one drink wont hurt. But it will! Not only will it lead to binge drinking again but damage my body and brain even more quickly it seems.
Thank you for posting this!!
Thanks for this...very informative. 
This is very informative; thanks for the info!
Interesting. Thank you.
This is a wonderful post. My work relies on my being able to "think" well and I feel a decent gain in just the 236 days I've been abstaining. I know it takes a lot longer than that to really get good results but I am happy to be on the way.  The info about relapsing even a little negatively impacting it is just icing on the cake. 
Thanks for posting GF. I always enjoy your posts and I especially love the scientific information involving the brain. Reading a post like this is a big motivator to not relapse.

YAY! Rather be a thinker than a drinker.
Thanks so much for posting this!  I had always heard about the effect of drinking on the brain but not the studies of brain recovery. Very good and very encouraging news that I can salvage what I have and even repair some of the damage I've done to myself. 
Great info. This is a good motivator to not relapse again.
Thanks for posting!
This pretty much answers the "should I try moderation" question.  Although that question had been answered long ago for me.
What scares me about posts like these is I really don't think I've ever had any adverse health effects due to my drinking besides the nasty hangovers. My memory has always been keen my problem-solving skills at best as far as I know. I only drank extremely heavy for about 2 years or less. If I were to keep that up I know I would see some nasty things. I'm so glad I have 100 days now at the age of 24. Maybe I can escape damage altogether.
I wish they defined "resumed drinking". Is this daily? Or like once a week? I can't believe that there's no difference between the two !..Either way my neurons are growing !! No poison for me :) 
Thanks for posting this this is a great antidote to the "maybe one day when I've done enough work on myself I'll be okay to drink again" thoughts.
Good post thanks for the info. 
I've always wondered how much alcohol it takes to cause these changes in the brain.  Say for example one person who gets absolutely shit faced on the weekends but sober during the weekday vs someone who drinks daily but not to the point of being shitfaced but nicely drunk.  
Thank you for this post. Your timing is impeccable. Driving home tonight my brain was giving me the old "I've been thinking..." story. You know the one - where it goes on to say how long forever is and one drink wouldn't hurt - so I got home opened up SD and boom - here's your post. You nipped that little brain's been thinking story in the butt for me.  Thank you kindly GF. :) 
 &gt;Accordingly chronic alcoholics demonstrate impaired judgment blunted affect poor insight social withdrawal reduced motivation distractibility attention and impulse-control deficits...I always just put this down to forgetfulness grumpiness being generally pissed off with the world and aging.... lol
Thanks for this info helps to keep what's important in perspective. 
Thanks for the post. I've been a classic binge drinker for some time. I know I hurt heavy after these and have for some time. I'm still pretty sharp but on those recovery days (and they are days) I'm slow and tired and all the rest. I did some real thinking starting Sunday about what I am doing to myself. This sort of information really makes me think deeper about things. It feels good to feel good. Sick and tired is not fun.
Um... Wow. Thanks for this.
