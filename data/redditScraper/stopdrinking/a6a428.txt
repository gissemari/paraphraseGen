Wow!  Just discovered Jolene Park and her discussion of "gray area drinking."  That was SO me!  It's kind of amazing to see your own struggle written out by another person.  We are most definitely not alone dearies.  IWNDWYT.

I'm not familiar with Jolene Park's definition of it but I talked myself into thinking that my drinking was pretty gray area for much of my twenties - not healthy but not out of control (most of the time.) But my underlying relationship with alcohol was unhealthy. I was using it to cope with life. And over time my drinking got worse. ..Looking back I wish I had spent less time in denial and less time trying to manage my drinking and make it work. I wanted to see my drinking as fine so I could keep doing it. I did not want to see it as a problem because I didn't want to have to completely quit. My younger self would've latched onto a term like gray area drinking for sure because that sorta sounds like someone who can still learn to be a healthy drinker.

Looking back...it sure is easier to not drink than to be consumed with all the alcohol related internal conversations I had when I was drinking. My mind is finally free.
