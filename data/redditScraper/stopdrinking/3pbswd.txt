This post is for anyone who thinks you can't stay sober even atleast two weeks. I want to answer some questions I had about achieving atleast some time of sobriety...I've been sober for 2 weeks before (personal record is 3 weeks) and around day 8-11 I've always relapsed but not this time. Throughout this 2-week period I've been thinking about this quote from Albert Einstein:.."Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results."..That is exactly what I was doing when I was relapsing over and over again. I didn't make changes that were big enough. ..I started to:..- exercise regularly (atleast every other day atleast a walk of 30 mins).- managed to stick to my plant based-diet (if you are interested in this you can PM me or watch Forks over Knives) but also was kind on myself if I found myself binging on fast food etc. But the urge to binge also lessens with this super-healthy diet...-  I talked to my support group about my urges to drink (SD and sober irl friends). ..The urges come and go I might have one every day but the battle isn't even that big anymore. In those dark moments I keep thinking how far I've come in terms of mental health mental clarity and physical health and those things really help me stay sober. So I'd say just survive for the first few weeks if you can't do anything else. It really gets easier day by day if you are willing to work on it...Hope this is useful to someone! 1 day 1 hour 1 minute at a time....**Edit**: wanted to add some more benefits that the title proposed and info about whole foods plant based diet which I've been on more and less succesfully for a few months now...Psychological: - Self-esteem is so much better I've started to feel like a person worth of happiness. It's easier to smile at people when you aren't constantly destroying your body and in return you get so much good vibes from people. - Mental clarity: my goals are clearer everything is much more manageable. Everything good in life is ten times better sober. The bad things in life are easier to handle...Physical: - Lost a few pounds of fat. Sleep is better. Digestive system works perfectly. Having tons and tons of energy which I feel I really need to burn off with excercise. Skin is clearing up. My senses are wakening up: I smell and feel things better than I used to...**Whole foods plant-based diet in a nutshell:**..- It essentially means you eat plants: vegetables and fruits nuts and seeds legumes. You can call it a vegan diet. The less animal products the better. That means anything that has a face or a mother: meat chicken eggs fish and dairy. Believe it or not humans aren't designed to eat animal protein and saturated fats. We can survive on those but its not optimal it's killing us. It isn't essential. It causes heart disease diabetes etc. There is tons and tons of research about this. ..- The healthies longest living and thriving populations get **less than 1%** of their daily calories from animal products: Okinawa Sardinia and Seventh Day Adventists in Loma Linda CA...- Check out Dr. Garth Davis on Facebook. His book "Proteinaholic: How Our Obsession with Meat Is Killing Us and What We Can Do About It" just came out and its **awesome**..I discovered this lifestyle through Rich Roll an alcoholic and fast food junkie turned ultraman. He has 2 books Finding Ultra and The Plantpower Way. ...

Thanks for the advice.  I'm going to look into watching Forks Over Knives because for the first time in my life I can't fit into my clothes.  
It's useful to me - thank you so much...NOT drinking is the only hope I have in this life right now.  I literally have no hope if I pick up another drink.  It's so nice to hear about those benefits.  ..I've always exercised but I've been such a dickhead to myself - I'd reward a big swim or cycle with a bottle of wine afterwards - then write-off the next day.  I've been my own worst enemy for so long now - I need to be my best friend - or even just a friend will do...!..I will look into "forks over knives" too - thank you again.
Thanks for this :)..I'm really curious about this plant based diet now and I'm sure other people are too. Could you give us some more details about it here ?
Awesome! Congrats on two weeks and great advice! ..I also found exercise and support to be extremely important.  I didn't eat all that well for my first few weeks(months). 
lovit!!..keep us posted!! once a week?
Awesome congrats! I found that my problem was a spiritual one and once I was dry enough ( took treatment for me) I took a long hard look at my life and changed my belief system. For me I had to get to root cause of my drinking. I've tried countless life changes diet running lifting only drinking on weekends only drinking beer yadda yadda yadda nothing worked. Once I figured out my life problem I applied Buddhism along with Christianity and together they provide the psyche change I need for a permanent change of my belief system. I am one drink away from being a 750 a day drinker again. God bless! 
Upvote for Rich Roll; I listen to his podcast at the gym and it's always fun. ..Glad to see you're doing better about taking care of your health. I too turned to exercise when I decided to cut down on my drinking; besides the fitness benefits it's also a powerful disincentive for exercise. Have you ever run a 5K or swam a mile with a hangover?  ..Keep on keepin' on man. You're doing great.
Awesome. Keep staying focused!
OP you should also consider getting a Badge (from the sidebar) and doing the 'Daily Pledge'; it really helps me get focused first thing in the morning and seeing the numbers go up feels so good!..edit: incorrect link to Forks over Knives
