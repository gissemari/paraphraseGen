Gotta just remind yourself this is totally normal. Alcohol is an addictive drug and it will produce cravings. In addition most of us have tricked ourselves at some point or another in our lives that alcohol is beneficial (makes parties more fun kills boredom makes us more sociable blah blah) so that's gonna make the cravings seem like you're denying yourself of something good...You know better! These 'cravings' are just a bit of mental and physical discomfort - you can handle a bit of discomfort right? You're doing this for an important reason.
I think it eases the longer you go but I am thinking that for myself I will get them now and again forever. (they are not a big deal for me now which is good hoping that future ones are the same - easily dismissed).Congrats on 6 days that is amazing!!!
It does get better. I promise. I've been here before. I literally just woke up from a nightmare but I know it's my subconscious trying to process what's going on finally now that I'm sober. I thought about the dream and how it relates to what's stressful in my life. ..I looked at myself in the mirror. I told myself  I love and approve of you . That affirmation has helped me so much. I started a few times a day then a few hundred times a day. Now anytime I see a mirror. That was one free tool I used to help manage the cravings. ..I looked at my skin and thought  wow I can't wait a few weeks from now when it's glowing again . It takes time but it will. Alcohol robs so much from us. Those cravings are begging you to come back with false promises. ..It's difficult yes. But I was just thinking today how many hangovers I've battled in my life I know I sure as hell can get through these feelings without that extra shame guilt and dehydrated on top of it! ..You got this!   I won't drink with you today!   -vy
Thank you for your post!  I won't be drinking with you today!..Cravings remind me of my addiction and the work that I have left to do in order to keep life on the right track. For me that means accepting whatever my mind dishes out and trying to calmly observe the crazy little drama schemes rather than become hooked by them into doing something stupid that I really don't want to do...Remaining calm was so important during my new recovery...Here are some of my favorite stopdrinking searches to click: ..[consequences](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=consequences&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[alcoholic](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=alcoholic&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[relapse](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=relapse&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[moderation](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=moderation&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[humility](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=humility&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[atheist](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=atheist&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[decision](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=decision&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[attitude](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=attitude&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[prison](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=prison&amp;restrict_sr=on)..More Help: [Steps_1_2_3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/477gm4/demystifying_the_steps_simply_a_set_of_tools_part/) --.[12 Steps No Religion](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3wdrft/after_some_editing_in_the_dino_den_an_agnostic/) --.[Urge Surfing 8-minute recording](http://depts.washington.edu/abrc/mbrp/recordings/Urge%20Surfing.mp3).
Well I'm mad at the part of your brain that is being hard on you while you're doing a ton of work. That's not very supportive brain. You're not having psychological cravings on purpose; they are just coming up in the course of your work. So I feel it's quite rude and I think it should back off and go criticize the wind for blowing or whatever other natural phenomenon it finds unsatisfactory. Because **you** are brave and **you** are fighting and that is all. you. have. to. do. ..Perfection is for jerky brain parts that never have to get their hands dirty and really have no business opining on those who do. IWNDWYT!
I don't mean to be a debbie downer but now and again I still "want a drink."  Over the years I've developed a bunch of strategies for dealing with cravings.  I consciously think of a bad time I had with alcohol.  I also remind myself that it's just a feeling it's not bad or good and soon enough I'll feel different...This might be a little corny but I feel really good when I get through a craving without drinking.  Don't forget to celebrate your victories!
