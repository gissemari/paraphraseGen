I was not struggling this time until these last two or three days....I don't know if i can handle having a "boring" relationship with my girlfriend. See we used to go to bars every weekend. We were not getting plastered everyday but on weekends we liked. It was our main thing together....Now we just watch movies and go out to eat something. We are home at midnight if we push it and if one of us stays at each other houses doing nothing. She is sober for three weeks because of a cosmetic surgery but she is recovering and soon will be good as new....I know she is getting bored she is younger than me (25 i'm 28) and i'm ok with boring weekends and sleeping early. I always sleep early i prefer it and love the mornings. She is the opposite....There's a wedding in two weeks and she will be the bridesmaid with a lot of her friends and she is trying to stop drinking but i know it's because of myself. She said she will try to not drink at the wedding but i know this is not gonna happen and i don't want her to stop drinking because of me...She wanted to stop with me because she knew it was something i wanted to do. There was a time she was not being supportive and said she wanted to go to a bar but drinking alone is boring so she would just stay at home like always. This really hit me and i relapsed that day....I drank and i was sad for it. It didn't feel a relief. I felt like a failure....Now the feeling is creeping up again. I knew this last night she was bored. She didn't want to watch a movie she just wanted to lay in bed. I could feel she was bored and wanted to go to a bar but she said it was too early to drink 10 days after a surgery....The thing is. Life in general is much better without hangovers regrets and with money on my pocket. I'm paying my debts became healthy and saving money but i'm feeling alone in this....I keep thinking that i want to drink to get over with this. To stop this...If i drink then it's over. I will not have to be boring our weekends won't have to be boring she won't be afraid and bored again and i'll not be afraid of feeling left out and alone on the wedding. Short on money but not afraid....It's been really hard these last three days.

What are you afraid of? Do you think that you will drink if she does? Can you ask her not to drink around you? ..My husband has had a beer a few times since I got sober. It doesn't bother me because I know that I don't have to drink. That being said my huabnd has never had a problem with drinking. I have known him for 18 years and in that time he has been drunk three times (all three times when he was in his early 20s)...I have come to realize that sober life is certainly not boring.  We do a lot more fun things now that I don't spend all my free time drinking.
&gt;There was a time she was not being supportive and said she wanted to go to a bar but drinking alone is boring so she would just stay at home like always. This really hit me and i relapsed that day.  ..I seem to remember you posting about that.  ..My wife was my drinking buddy.  Before I stopped we drank every night with even more alcohol consumed on the weekend.  Our life together **revolved** around drinking.  We watched movies and television shows at home and drank went to restaurants and drank we went to bars and drank and all of our friends did the same. . . . then I stopped.  ..We still go to restaurants; she drinks I don't.  We still watch movies and television shows; she drinks I don't.  We still go to dinner parties with friends; they drink I don't.  We don't go to bars anymore - I simply don't have any interest in them.  We still go to weddings; she drinks I don't.  You get the idea.  ..I am not responsible for my wife's behavior and I am not responsible for her entertainment.  She will quit when she has suffered enough (like me) or never.  It is not my responsibility.  More importantly she is not responsible for my behavior - **I am.**  If I were uncomfortable being around her when she is consuming alcohol I would have two choices - go somewhere else or stay put.  I wouldn't hesitate to leave if I felt tempted.  ..&gt;I don't know if i can handle having a "boring" relationship with my girlfriend.  ..I don't feel that my relationship with my wife is *boring* now.  It is different now but *boredom* is a feeling and feelings change.  My behavior is stable now.  Perhaps it appears boring to some.  I feel like I'm experiencing *freedom* for the first time in a long time.  
I'm afraid to tell you what you don't want to hear... but (always a 'but' right?) perhaps it's time to examine the fact that you built your relationship around drinking. And it sounds like she has an awful lot of control over your feelings sometimes it's good to just own your feelings yourself...I don't know good luck. I hope you find a way to do what's best for yourself all-around :)
If your relationship is based on whether or not you drink alcohol is that what you want? Getting sober is easy but staying sober not  so much. I couldn't do it without lots of support. A therapist and AA gave me the guidance and encouragement I needed. I also made sober fun-loving friends. Maybe it would work for you. 
A lot of us who struggle with alcoholism also struggle with co-dependence and your story seems to point in that direction. Do any of these sound familiar?..- difficulty making decisions in a relationship.- difficulty identifying your own feelings.- difficulty communicating in a relationship.- Valuing the approval of others more that valuing yourself.- Lacking trust in yourself and having poor self-esteem.- Having fears of abandonment or an obsessive need for approval.- Having an unhealthy dependence on relationships even at your own cost.- Having an exaggerated sense of responsibility for the actions of others.- inability to tolerate being alone accompanied by frantic efforts to avoid being alone.- chronic feelings of boredom and emptiness.- subordinating one's own needs to those of the person with whom one is involved.- overwhelming desire for acceptance and affection..You are NOT responsible for her ultimate happiness and you are not the end all be all when it comes to her being happy. ..Honestly? Your whole post sounds like a long justification from your addict side to drink. It's up to you whether or not you call that voice out on its bullshit. Have you given thought to therapy? I think all of us can benefit from talking things through with guidance. 
If you and your girlfriend are going to stay together -- you both have to put some serious effort into making it work. ..You need a sober community. Athletics. Cooking. Some activity that is alcohol-free by nature. In that community you will make friends with people who share your interest. When you say it is hard to find sober friends you may only be looking at the AA communities or ones that are centered on support. Just make friends without booze surrounding you...Your girlfriend needs to have a life outside of you especiallllllly during your transition into sobriety. Friends activities of her own -- echoing what everyone else has said you can't feel responsible for her happiness...Bottom line: you are not responsible for her happiness and she is not responsible for yours. You must. take. responsibility. for. yourselves. It is critical in order to make your relationship work right now. Support each other love each other but become accountable. If you don't think that you do it like seriously do it and work on it and communicate honestly and openly about it as it happens then you may want to explore alternative options e.g. taking a break/splitting up. ..
First - boredom is not a good reason to drink It can provide drama indeed too much drama in my experience...Second For ME my drinking was really only a symptom of a deeper problem which was a self esteem which was warped cracked over and under inflated and generally confused.  That self esteem did not propel me into healthy relationships...Some of this may be in play in your case...  In any case your sobriety your recovery are yours and yours alone.   ..The suggestion of no major decisions for the first year is a good one except in cases of abuse.   You have the rest of your life to figure this stuff out. It might take some time.
I don't think you'll be doing her a favour by relapsing. Why did you stop drinking in the first place? 
You can still do things on the weekends! Discuss things you've two have always wanted to try! It makes sobriety not so boring and you will feel like you're doing something! ..My wife and I are attempting tennis we always wanted to try and we are horrible. But it's fun because we are out doing things. We have a long list of activities we want to do and now we don't feel so boring as well. It makes staying in to watch a movie as well feel not so mundane. :)
Go to places/do things where she can drink and you can be entertained.  Movies are good for this as she can get loaded up or sneak booze in and you get to watch a movie.  You are still doing things together she is still drinking and you are still sober.  Comedy clubs can be fun as well but do bear in mind there will be some temptation there.  I'll get downvoted to hell for this but a little bit of Red Pill mentality could go a long way here.  Key word a *little* bit of red pill mentality.  Let her know you mean business and you are making a change in your life for the better.
I had to drop my girl and be single for a while when getting sober.  My gf and I were animals and when we stopped drinking things were actually okay but I kept relapsing once a month. I missed her and life sucked but I'm not relapsing every month. It had a lot to do w co dependency and stress of the relationship.
