6 weeks ago I stopped cold turkey. On day 3 I had a major panic attack and I had my folks put me in the ER. One month stress free sobriety (beyond withdrawals) told me that control was mine. Two weeks ago a relapse said otherwise. Today the I saw the doctor and he was kind and sympathetic. I'm not letting this happen again I hope none of you do either. Thank you for being wonderful people.

Glad you are here!
Keep coming back. 
I'm glad you're still with us.  I focus on the 24 hours ahead every day--in that way I have avoided relapse.  
Hey welcome back! So glad you're here. Jump right back on :).
I know it might sound trite but relapse is part of recovery. It took me several relapses in still newly sober but this is the first time " is nothing clicked " I really don't have a desire to drink. It doesn't even really cross my mind. What I did differently this time was I opened up to almost everyone that I don't want to drink anymore to stay accountable. I attend AA meetings nearly daily and have a home group ( no sponser yet but I want it to be organic) I read the big book for inspiration and I avoid situations where alcohol is present. Basically I put my Sobriety first. Hang in there!
