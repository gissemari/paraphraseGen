There seem to be lot of guys struggling with sleep clearing their throats snoring post nasal drip and borderline sleep apnea. I think the obesity epidemic stress and erratic schedules causing people to easy late are a problem. I seem to notice it more in my 30s. I have trouble. Drinking certainly doesn't help. I was an occasional binge drinker but while going months drinking responsibly (no more than three a day or seven a week) it would still mess up my sleep. I've been sleeping better now.

For me sleep was one of the first and most impactful changes that I've experienced so far. I sleep more hours with greater effect ever since I stopped drinking. Even when I did moderate like you describe I would wake up from a full night of sleep feeling like those hours had somehow been less "efficient." I'm in my early(ish) 30s as well and I already am getting the feeling like just by the quality of sleep alone I'll be aging a lot less quickly in the next decade with how much better my sleep is. 
Sleep is sloooowly getting better for me.  I'm only a couple weeks in but I'm actually able to fall asleep on my own now.  I had to take Unisom right after quitting because I was unable to fall asleep without literally passing out.  I didn't know how isn't that crazy?  But now I do some breathing techniques and without fail they work.  I do them and I think "this isn't going to work" but night after night clearly I'm falling asleep.
