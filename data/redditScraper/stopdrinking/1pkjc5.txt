I have been sober for 84 days today. I was drinking extremely heavily every day and night for months/years leading up to my most recent stay in a detox ward. Up until less than a week ago I had virtually no cravings felt upbeat and in general good health. This week things are different and I cannot figure it out...I have felt severely depressed and have had the most intense cravings intrusive relapse fantasies and suicidal thoughts dizziness anxiety etc and it seems to be getting worse every day. I don't want to drink and I haven't yet but if this doesn't stop I need to put my brain to rest. It's too disturbing. ..I have never felt mentally ill or been diagnosed with any psychiatric disorder in the past. Advice is appreciated.

Google "PAWS symptoms" and you may find the answer to your question. Otherwise my best suggestion is to have a chat with your doctor. ..Here's a good explanation:..* http://whatmesober.com/personal-writing-about-addiction-and-recovery/early-recovery/paws/
