I was inspired by a post telling us lurkers that we are loved reminding me that this is a safe place. I have really been struggling. Last year I was able to get a streak of 34 days and one streak of 52 days AF. I've been struggling with alcohol for 10 years and that was the best I had ever done. What really helped then were books like This Naked Mind and Alcohol Explained.  I had tried AA off and on for years but struggle with some of the dogma and rigidity that many members have. Also I do not want to run into clients (people who are court-ordered to attend meetings) at meetings and there aren't a ton where I live. Anyway I will re-read/listen to TNM AE and Craig Beck's Alcohol Lied to Me. I will read posts here daily. I am grateful for this space. ..Now I can't seem to get back on the AF wagon. I've had a lot of days-long binges in the last few months (since November). I had one last week while my husband was out of town and I didn't have a lot of places I needed to be for my job (I am an independent contractor). I keep going down that hole. It's vicious. Then if I have a day of drinking (my poison is vodka) I almost need it to keep from having any anxiety or nauseas the following day. I did that yesterday but only drank a fraction of what I had been drinking in the previous week. Alcohol is an evil poison and I want my life back...&amp;#x200B;..Anyway thanks for letting me share. ..&amp;#x200B;

Ha I need to get a new badge because I most certainly have not made it to 100 days!
I'm right here with you. My poison is vodka too. Stashed and hidden. That I drink in multiple gulps at a time. While throwing out my last bottle this morning I took a tiny sip just to remember the putrid taste. Honestly it is disgusting. What on earth are we drinking?!?!
