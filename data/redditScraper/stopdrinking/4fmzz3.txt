----------immediate responses--------

Triumph: 11 days in! Feeling really good so far...Struggle: Home life is still in shambles. Don't know whether it's on the up swing or not...Nonsense: My little one's school alarm has been going off for 30 minutes. I had a dream/nightmare about her last night for the first time ever.
Triumph:  Getting to a place in my sobriety that I feel true happiness and peace..Struggle:  Surprisingly things are pretty smooth.  I would like to lose a few pounds though.  (Newfound sweet habit has prevented much weight lose).Passion:  Definitely delicious food!  Food tastes so much better sober.  Oh and birdwatching.  I love to watch all the birds at the feeder.  Even have big woodpeckers coming to feed!  .Have a great hump day!
**Triumph**: One Hundred days sober as of today! Also re-connected with old friends over dinner last night and wasn't at all tempted to order wine with dinner. I was able to completely focus on the conversation without half of my brain begging for more wine!..**Struggle** My teenage daughter struggles with anxiety and depression -- she has professional help but the daily struggle with her at home is tough. It's an emotional roller coaster and I feel like I'm in a play but given the wrong script....I never say the right thing!..**General Nonsense** Hiking and letterboxing now that spring is here (and the bugs aren't out quite yet)! There's nothing like heading out into the woods with my faithful companion Dash the wonderhound and poking around to find hidden treasures! I've also gotten into Contra Dancing once a week. Great fun with sober folks and something my daughter and I can go to together.
Triumph: Got a Shop deal in the city centre for my artwork. Can't wait. .Struggle: Cravings suck the life out of me at 7pm every day still got no money don't know what to do with myself at night.General nonsense: Really giving some thought to selling my car. A car is just a car.....right?
Triumph: My new online shop is starting to get some real business :)..Struggle: I'm sick I need to see a cardiologist but until I make the monies - oh and I fucking will I can do anything fuck defeat - until then I'll take what ever happens and just keep moving forward guns blazing. My mind will carry my body when it is too weak. I will win. In the end I always find a way to get up when everyone else thinks I'm done. Fuck it give me more I can take it. ..Passion - Getting into Jujitsu I try and keep up as best as I can but I have serious limitations regardless-  I love it. Wish I started a year ago. I couldn't recommend anything better than physical exercise for rebooting your body and keeping your mind on track. 
Triumph: Tomorrow is 300 days sober. ..Struggle: Teenage sons can be a pain in the ass. ..General Nonsense: My passion is gaming which is mainly D&amp;D. I feel my old creative juices stirring and I need to start working on developing a new campaign but am having a hard time settling on what I want to do.

**Triumph:** Even though I came really *really* close to drinking on Saturday and again on Monday I didn't. I'm confident I'm going to make it to my objective of April 23rd...**Struggle:** Symptoms of mental instability / illness that were "adequately" managed by being drunk all the goddamn time are getting hard to deal with again and are putting a strain on my relationships...**General Nonsense:** Kyokushin karate! I started practicing again this fall when my work schedule finally allowed me to. Lately I'm at the dojo 3 nights a week and Saturday mornings too (because I'm not hungover on Saturdays anymore). I'm training for a competition in May.
**Triumph:** Home appraisal matched my offer huzzah!!  And I am learning how to better respond to a very emotional girlfriend - I *think* that's a triumph?..**Struggle:**  I have a very emotional girlfriend who can take out her feelings on me and I have to work hard to fight my ACOA tendencies and be either codependent or run away...**Nonsense:**  My passion hmm...well said girlfriend has certainly awakened some passion I didn't think still existed in me.  Beyond that I'm getting excited to start road riding again - just got the bike ready to go!  Now if it would only stop snowing!!
**Triumph:** I am now getting used to sober living and can begin to see the bigger picture instead of just getting through a day without booze one day at a time (although I am still doing that)...**Struggle:** I am trying to learn how to care for houseplants (all my life I have been the Joseph Stalin of houseplants; thousands have died under my rein)...**Nonsense:** I have put up a hummingbird feeder with nectar and am now awaiting what the packaging called  the jewels of the sky. .
Triumph: I am working and confronting my addictions head on rather than ignoring them.  I paid for golf pass and have saved a few hundred dollars for hobbies.  ..Challenge: to stay committed to the one day at a time approach.  To say no on the golf course.  ..General: excited  30 days is coming up.  I am happy  and want to continue this process.  
**Triumph:** [my husband and I adopted a rescue dog!!!](http://imgur.com/mWQ3R2W) I had some major baggage around this... I lost my previous two rescue dogs (whom I raised from puppies) during an awful breakup triggered by my drinking. I really wanted another but put it off for years because I couldn't confront my past. this is a huge accomplishment for me...**Struggle:** fuck you allergies. I can'd bweade. ..**General Nonsense:** my passion these days is reading and writing. (hooray for SD book club!) I've loved them both since childhood but somewhere along the way that spark was snuffed out by a wine bottle. so happy to ignite it again. 
**Triumph:** Things are going well. A friend reminded me that once they weren't. Not to put a damper on my joy but to further highlight it...**Struggle:** Still seeking balance with work. It's easy to go one way or the other but I haven't found the center...**Nonsense:** Once I estimated shipping a 12-pack of La Croix to England. the cult is strong but not *that* strong!
**Triumph**  Remaining sober despite there being death and frustration all around me.  ..**Struggle**  Relations with my father and a harassing neighbor with a traumatic brain injury.  My psychiatrist retired.  Remaining detached from my father's losing battle with alcohol...**General Nonsense**  Go Trump!  Does anyone believe him when he says he's never had an alcoholic beverage?  I think I do.
Triumph- my brain MRI came back normal!..Struggle- the reasons I needed one in the first place still are kicking my ass..General nonsense-spring has sprung! Woop woop!.
Day 5! 
Triumph:  I have had 2 nights of really great sleep!      Struggle:  Getting decent sleep - so tired all the time.     General Nonsense:  Good food as well and low carbing...
**Triumph**: I'm on my day 7 today! A week ago I would be wandering back and forth from the minifridge looking for beer or swigging from an open bottle of wine (why wait until 5?) Today my head is clearer as is my pee (so much fizzy water - Topo Chico is the jam). Looking forward to seeing how it feels to have more sober days...**Struggle**: Still trying to stay here and take it one day at a time not get caught up in all the tomorrows...**General Nonsense**: my passion these days is reading. Getting back into books (and actually finishing them!) I also got one of those adult coloring books I wouldn't quite call it a passion but the process of filling in the pages sure is calming and meditative.
Triumph: I have my closest friends on board with "cutting down" on drinking. It makes me feel comfortable and excited that we don't have to drink/get drunk to have fun. ..Struggle: my health this week. I have a migraine I can't shake and it's depressing me. ..My passion these days: I'm excited about my new church and trying to get involved. I'm excited about getting things done- my allergy shots cleaning...I had no drive to accomplish things before. 
**Triumph** I called to make an appointment with a new therapist today. I didn't have a great experience with my last therapist and I was feeling kind of burned but in hindsight I think it was just a bad fit and I think it'll really help my recovery. ..**Struggle** My apartment still looks like a tornado ripped through it... I know I just need to bite the bullet and de-clutter but every time I look around I just get overwhelmed. ..**Nonsense** I'm starting to enjoy the things I used to like to do again (this week mostly yoga and cooking). I feel like for most of the past two months I would try to do things that usually brought me joy and would just kind of feel... nothing. So that cloud is lifting and I'm really glad about it...P.S. Count me in for the SD book club!
Triumph: Over two weeks sober! Had the /r/Seattle sober dinner meetup last night and it was amazing!! There were even some non-sober people that came that abstained for the event anyway. It was really great and I have some new friends!..Struggle: My partner has drank enough to be tipsy almost every night for the last two weeks. Last night I finally got the courage to ask him if he wouldn't mind not drinking a few times a week because I miss the real him. I'm hoping to finish that discussion tonight...General nonsense: My passion has always been nature and the outdoors. I've been a member of a hiking group through Facebook for a few weeks and I'm excited to be attending my first hike with them on Saturday! I'm really happy to be getting back into what I love. 
**TRIUMPH** None of my "struggles" trigger an urge or desire to drink.     ..**Struggle** wife texts me this AM that close family member leaving spouse. Now have to wait the work day to hear/help.  .Also boss (es) have all come down on me to fix a laptop &lt;&gt; projector display issue for their family friend. In 10 mins I demonstrated it's an issue I can't fix and get the so fix it then. Ive sunk hours into this shit despite actual *business* tasks now on back burner.        ..**General Nonsense** my hawthorne bushes are in bloom and humming like power lines with all the bees :)
Triumph - Came out about my alcoholism to my close friends and family. The amount of support is amazing. ..Struggle - This fucking first week guys! Jesus. I'll make it. One step at a time. ..Nonsense - I LOVE grapefruit La Croix just sayin
Triumph: Work is looking much stronger this year partly due to me not drinking. Daughter had a great 7th birthday today. Seeing her smiles is ace...Struggle: My bad knee isn't well enough for me to cycle with. The weather has been decent the last couple of days so it's been frustrating to not get out...General nonsense: Cardamom &amp; coffee dark chocolate is fucking lovely.
Triumph: 9 days sober!!!!!!!! This is the longest I've been sober in years. Feels amazing x) cravings aren't too bad and I'm learning to moderate other trouble areas in my life. ..Struggle: I'm tackling over-eating issues that I've had all my life. For now I'm just taking baby steps and tuning in with how full or hungry I actually feel and not eating just because there's food in front of me. ..Nonsense: I got a little cactus and is growing the most beautiful purple flowers :)
Triumph: 17 days sober. Been running and meditating. Head starts to clear..Struggle: Seeing the state of my life as the fog diminishes. Really all space in my head seems to be filled with the idea that i have ruined everything and only way to escape this feeling is to open the bottle again..General Nonsense: atm im passionated about reprogramming my self
[deleted]
Triumph: after power yoga today I noticed I'm getting visibly nice abs. I've always been someone who trains many things but always struggled with getting nice abs because wine. Yay!!!..Struggle: my head goes to the bad place lately and it's taking a lot to keep myself out of that...Passion: backwoods camping and hiking with my husband. I'm in the process of planning a backwoods trip in the Rockies for this summer. I'm very excited about it all!
**Triumph/Struggle:** I'm leaving a job I truly love--my coworkers are great my boss is great the whole work environment is great. But it's time to move on to bigger and better things. So although I'm having a tough time saying my goodbyes I'm excited for what's next. Bittersweet I guess..**Passion:** I'm still running. This is monumental. I feel like my old cross-country-running-high-school-self. The trails are beautiful...and I love how much energy and happiness I get from just a mile or two. My coaches from middle school and high school managed to instill a love for running in me that I wasn't aware of till now and it stuck with me even after my lethargic mostly sedentary college/post-college years...Also I'm thinking this SD Book Club might become a new passion so I'm excited to start the April-May reads! *Confederacy of Dunces* has been on my to-read list for ages...
Triumph: .This week I was promoted (though first day wasn't perfect) I bought a truck (I haven't had a solid truck in years) and I have my six-day-a-week workout schedule and diet dialed in...Struggle:.Getting the loan for my truck was a little tricky at points but it worked out. I can actually say that I didn't have a lot of struggles this week. ..General Nonsense: Not missing drinking I've been crazy productive. I could not have even fathomed this state of mind a year ago.
