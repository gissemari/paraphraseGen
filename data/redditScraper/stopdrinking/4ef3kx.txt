TLDR: 9 years drunk/dry/sober repeat. Now in drug court. New sobriety date 4/1/16...Hi all- so glad I stumbled across this subreddit!  I was listening to WTF podcast Marc's guest mentioned the book 'the easy way to stop drinking' by Alan Carr and a search led me here yay! ..I've been struggling with this shit since 2007.  I'm 34 now and my longest sober time was just shy of 2 years.  At my worst I was drinking a half gallon of rum and/or vodka every day. I've been to inpatient rehab as well as intensive outpatient and I've been in and out of AA for the past 9 years.  I've had a couple of duis and I was on probation for aggravated assault- I had blacked out and don't remember it.  I kept violating my probation by drinking and they were either going to terminate my probation unsuccessfully meaning possible prison time or I could participate in the drug court program. I've been married for 15 years and we have a daughter  so needless to say I've taken the drug court option. That was back in September. Drug court is a bitch but I'm being self interested about it and getting what I can out of it and making it work for me. ..Ten days ago I relapsed on fucking mouthwash. It showed up on the etg (I didn't self report) so tomorrow I'm going to the local clink for a 24 hour nap. I haven't had such an intense craving to drink as I did after the judge informed me that I'd have to do a day in jail.  The day isn't an issue it's more that the drug court team led me to believe I wouldn't have to go to jail- so I felt betrayed. (Also I live in a small town where they will put my mugshot up on the bookings website so that kinda sucks).  I got over that initial crazy craving by driving around for a bit going on a walk stretching the time out and weighing pros and cons of getting drunk right then and eventually determining that in the long term this is a small glitch.  This too shall pass...On the lighter side  my sobriety date is now April fools day!  Thanks for reading/ letting me vent. I'm mostly the lurker type but I'll be checking in here on the regular. Anybody else have drug court experience? I'll greatly appreciate any support; and I'd be happy to answer any questions and dole out my own experience strength and hope!..~~Btw- I see people have #of days next to their name how do you do that?~~ edit: submitted for the badge.  ..Thanks and glad to be here!

Welcome /u/coodaj to r/stopdrinking--I'll leave you with the [Baby Steps link](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is what I did to stop drinking even after returning from relapse in 2009.  There are also links that might be helpful for figuring out the community.  Good luck to you.
Welcome to r/sd. I have felt lots of support here just lurking. Becoming a commenting member has been my lifeline through many a tough craving. Although the more days that have passed the more I'm likely to comment just because...(like now). This sub allows me to have a support system in my pocket for which I am truly grateful.
