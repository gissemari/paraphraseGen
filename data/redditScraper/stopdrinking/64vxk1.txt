[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy Hump Day! What's Up Wednesdays are when we celebrate our sobriety see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** A doctor has told my mother (who is staying with me) not to drink at all for three weeks as part of a test for how her digestion is working. I am proud to be able to provide a place for her to stay that is completely booze-free...**Struggle:** For about eleven years I rode around on caf  racer that I loved. Even after getting badly injured (ironically I was hit by a drunk driver) I still kept riding. Years later I sold my motorcycle and got a car but lately I have been struggling with wanting a caf  racer again. But I feel that getting one would mean once again giving in to the dopamine addiction...**General:** San Francisco now has a cat caf  and I really want to go. I think spending time with animals is a great way to relax and unwind...Now that you aren't drinking what do you do to relax?.
----------immediate responses--------

TRIUMPH: Currently on a road trip have been visiting amazing jazz clubs and never once felt an urge to drink.  And got up once at 7am to workout!..STRUGGLE: I'm eating a lot of donuts and pastrami on this road trip and my pants are legit getting tighter.  The gift and the curse.  At least it's not booze!..GENERAL: I relax by putting on a Stevie Wonder record and watching food bloggers' Instagram stories.  Yeah it's a true story.
T: I feel my power again. Waking up early instead of bad mood and hungover I visit this place to get support and give support. .S: I need more money yeah....G: Looking for better job now. I'm ready for challanges.
Triumph: I started applying for university and I'm excited to go back to school and eventually do something I enjoy. I've been cooking for years and the whole industry is pretty boozy and I need to get away from it. ..Struggle: Easter is this weekend and I'm going home for family dinner. Family dinners have historically been very drunk for all parties involved and my SO is coming to this one. I'm having some anxiety about that that is making it difficult to concentrate. ..General: I've been listening to lectures on addiction while I go about my daily chores and I find both relaxing and informative. Completely in the opposite direction I recently rediscovered grand theft auto 5 and have been enjoying causing simulated havoc. ..Happy Wednesday SD! Looks like another fine day to not drink with you. 
Triumph: I've started reading again. Even though I'm finding it very difficult to focus for very long I'm hopeful about building up my concentration and rediscovering my love of books...Struggle: I'm struggling with the day-to-day monotony of life. Things feel more stable and predictable now that I'm not drinking and while that's a good thing in many ways I find that there's this pit of dread growing in my stomach. Maybe I'm a bit depressed? I feel a bit defeated knowing that things are going to play out similarly each day...General: I love making plans and lists and ideas but I really need to work on following through! 
Triumph: went to a Passover Seder last night where there was plenty of wine and weed around.  Didn't have any urged or desires to drink/smoke and proud of myself for that..Struggle: I'm at 28 days now and I'm still struggling with the concept of being sober forever and giving this and pot up completely ..General: I started working a part time job last week and already they're considering giving me a full time schedule ..Now that you aren't drinking what do you do to relax?.I've been doing other things such as walking around the city   coffee/breakfast with friends  going to the mall today I'm going to the shooting range and I'm going to help a friend go grocery shopping this evening ..
Triumph: I am not giving up--putting these single digit alcohol free days together!.Struggle: With leaving a chapter of my life behind with a particular group of people who keep contacting me. I need to tell them I really am taking a hiatus from their group for now..General: I love this question--I have never asked myself specifically what I do to relax. Usually I will read books or watch some mindless guilty-pleasure TV.  I would like to expand these options however and include some art. Many years ago I used to enjoy painting. I would love to take that up again.
Triumph: still on my longest streak of sobriety and feeling really strong. I genuinely don't ever want to drink again. ...Struggle: my own weird brand of loneliness is bothering me. I want to be alone all the time and dread going to work because I have to make chit chat and all that yet I do feel alone. I just can't connect to anyone. For years I relied on alcohol to connect with people but it was all false. It's just...strange. Being sober is strange....General: lately I've been relaxing by doing maths. It soothes me and it occupies my thoughts enough that I can't start getting anxious or mopey. Plus learning is just really gratifying. Especially when you manage to get something you'd been finding difficult. Still reading a ton too. I actually keep giving myself headaches by staying up too late reading lol. Can't believe I didn't pick up a book for so long when I was drinking! I literally just couldn't do it couldn't concentrate or take anything in.
Triumph: 17 freaking days with hardly any tears/bitchiness..Struggle: thinking about the future. Bachelorette party this weekend. Home alone next weekend. Wedding the weekend after that. My brain is thinking I chose a bad time to get sober- but is there ever a "good" time? ..General: my dog just got a haircut and he's so damn cute. I love him. 
TRIUMPH:  Feeling much more motivated than I have in a while- I'm looking forward to the day I have ahead of me!.STRUGGLE:  Well I have a reset badge.  I think I just kind of hit a wall over the last couple weeks.  I'm trying to take it as a reminder that I have to actively try and stay dry..GENERAL:  I'm really looking forward to my first cup of coffee today!
Triumph: Its been 9 days since I last drank not a big milestone as of yet but very determined to go longer than 4 weeks and longer..Struggle: not sleeping properly since then but that is due to my stress. Working night shift doesn't help either. It's nothing new but the stress of not sleeping and other things usually drive me to that first drink. I'm not going into that cycle again..General: kind of rough after those 5 days of no sleep and work. This week is a little more forgiving. I'm thinking of eating healthier to make myself feel better physically and mentally I think I need it.
Triumph: I've started working on doing pull-ups for the first time since college. I'm weak but I'll get stronger!..Struggle: My 19 year old son is struggling with depression and general lack of direction in life. It hurts to watch him go through this but I realize that all I can do is tell him I'm there for him...General: Now that I don't waste $ on wine (and indulgent food for wine related binges) I budgeted a deep tissue massage once every two weeks. I abused my body with alcohol and crap nutrition for 2+ decades so aggressive self care is my mantra now :)).
**Triumph** Just you know not drinking and stuff...**Struggle** SO and I have been pretty cranky the last couple of days. Feeling a bit disconnected...**General** Relaxation: I love to run. I also enjoy hanging with my kids and my pets. And I like crossword puzzles and Korean dramas.
**Triumph:** ..**Struggle:** Got a few of them going on...1) my SO and I are doing negotiating a trial separation and that's hard (I asked for it and want it but it's still hard). 2) I've also got a couple of people at work who are deeply challenging for me and I am digging deep to respond to each of them from a place of kindness and compassion rather than "fuck you" which is honestly more my shoot-fro-the-hip inclination. That wouldn't be effective in either case. 3) I see a surgeon tomorrow for a health issue that's arisen recently and while it's unlikely it could be pretty serious.  I hate waiting...**General:** I have recovery to thank for being committed to using new tools to face all of these challenges as rough as my skill in them may be.../u/sfgirlmary will you take me to the cat cafe next time I come to SF?? I miss my kitty who died in December.
Triumph:     Got up on the top step of a ladder and chopped down half of my neighbor's dead tree that's hanging over my driveway ready to fall any minute...Struggle:     My first Official Sober Date this Friday night. Oh. My. God. I'm a wreck!!!!! WTF?! I remember feeling these butterflies at 15 but at 44?!..General:      He knows and respects the fact that I don't drink at all - yay! I don't know what to wear. And my stomach and mind are all over the damn place about this! Gah!!!
Triumph: I've been surviving a lot of challenges to my sobriety. Even though life is rough right now I know that being sober is what I want and need. Looking forward to hitting seven months!..Struggle: My dad is dying. I was with him for three weeks and then had to come home for a while. I feel pretty guilty for needing to be away from him and my family. I worry about my 90 year old grandmother who is doing okay but it's still hard for her to lose her son. I wish my dad had been sober for my childhood. I feel like I don't know him as well as I could have. ..General: Seeing my sister today! We're getting lunch and going shopping. I'm pretty lucky to have her in my life. 
**Triumph:** I struggled with the urge to drink all weekend (the weather was perfect wine weather I'm a little stressed out etc.) but I kept myself busy and didn't drink...**Struggle:** I quit caffeine about 10 months ago and I'm no longer dependent on it. However I do have 2-3 cups of caffeinated coffee per week and I'm finding I really miss caffeine on the days I don't have it. ..**General:** I relax by spending more time at the gym and spending more time walking with my dog. 
**Triumph:** I've been a grumpy bastard this week. I've been applying the [Thoughts Emotions Behavior Triangle](https://goo.gl/images/H1zkG5) to myself a lot. It's not keeping me from being an asshole but it is keeping me from being a huge asshole...**Struggle:** I've been a grumpy bastard this week. I have been trying to stay very conscious of my behavior and avoid being a huge asshole...**Relaxing:** I build lego. I read. I cuddle the dog. I breathe--[Square Breathing](https://goo.gl/images/ii8Bjn) is one of my SOS techniques.
Triumph: I'm not scared of falling off the wagon. I poured the bottle I had stache'd down the drain. I'm feeling less angry/miserable. ..Struggle: I'm having to make a conscious effort to maintain relationship with my wife. I feel very disconnected from her right now even though she had been pretty solid for me. My body hurts so much. I'm aching like an old man. Been drinking heavy most nights for 10 years. I guess this pain is normal?..General: I'm getting outside in the warm weather and that is exciting. It's easier to leave the house when you aren't worried about your next drink. 
Triumph:  Booze has really been of my mind this past month I've had zero urges and I've been having tons of fun hanging out with my friends at bars and what not. ..Struggle:  I want to loose more weight but I have no interest in doing or changing anything in my lifestyle to get there.  I need to become more active but the wife now works later and I don't have an Adventure Buddy to go out and do things with. ..General: The one good thing about suffering from apathy is that  I'm probably the most stress free person you will ever meet.  Nothing bothers me.  What little stress I do get is taken care of by music and smoking.  
**Triumph:** There's an art show coming up at the spot where all the fellowship meetings are held and I'm working on a series of pieces to contribute as well as joining the planning committee. The style of the series is really different from my normal style but I feel good about it (or as good as I will feel about anything I make) and I'm excited to see where it goes. I've been painting a lot in general which feels really good...**Struggle:** Financially things are super super tight. I start my FT job in a little less than a month and there are some exciting developments happening around that but trying to keep my shit together until then is going to be a stretch. I'm stressing on it (I have $5 to my name and my next freelance paycheck doesn't come in for another ten days...and I have very little food in the house) but trying to keep my cool. ..**General:** Oh my god I am so ready for the sun. I feel like I am losing my mind. I'm at the end of being able to tolerate this rain. PNW woes. ..As for relaxing: baths are a wonderful wonderful thing. Also cats. I have two cats but I would still totes visit a cat cafe. Let us know if you go and how it is! ..
T: I'm still glowing over being a year sober! Just walking around with a smile on my face with gratitude in my heart...S: My dad is off his meds and going through a manic episode. He's bipolar and this is the worst he's let it get out of control. So much so that it's pulling the family apart and my mother had to move in with me. My routine has been thrown off and adjusting is hard but it's for the best and hopefully will be settling down soon. ..G: Relaxing is awesome now! Reading writing playing guitar painting taking walks with my dog and watching movies with my girlfriend are just a few things that relaxes me. The list can go on! I found that in sobriety relaxing actually exists and is supposed to be rejuvenating.
**Triumph:** I mulched our flower beds all by myself -- twelve bags!..**Struggle:** My legs are like broken. I think I have jogger's knee with my left leg and some sort of sciatica thing down my right. I'm trying to slow down do more weight lifting and yoga and stretching and stuff but not being able to easily burn calories with more intense cardio is ramping up my food anxieties. I'm down to 98 lbs which I can't really sustain without exercise but I probably shouldn't sustain because it's not a healthy weight and I'm probably not getting the nutrition I need to heal. idk...**General:** So this sounds weird but my automatic go-to for relaxation has always been to sit in front of a small space heater. I find the white noise + the heat to be soothing. 
Triumph: this is the longest I have been alcohol free for I don't know how many years. Alcohol was a big factor in my life for the last ten years. I finally realized I wanted to feel better and was sick of feeling tired all of the time and decided to give it a go. Skin clearer more energy overall more happy. I also have friends who do drink and I was surprised that I didn't feel pressured around them that was a big fear for me. They are supportive as well. It means the world to me...Struggle: I am not having too much yet there are a couple days here and there that are harder than others but I just distract myself until that feeling goes away. Iam finding it challenging yet rewarding to face all of this alone (aside from you guys of course) and head on. I don't like anything or anybody in control over me. Why would I let alcohol do that?..General: things are great I'm out of a draining relationship with a negative person.im exercising more  enjoying work. I am considering going back to school soon I quit drinking. None of this was possible had I not been alone to really understand what drinking has become over the years.
omg /u/sfgirlmary almost 700 days!!! let's celebrate at a cat cafe :D ..**Triumph:** they scheduled another round of interviews for my dream job next week! this is going well. (fingers crossed super hard) ..**Struggle:** they want me to give a presentation to the directors. I'm so nervous. once in a while I default to TOTAL PANIC MODE that I'm a fraud and they'll hate me and everything is terrible. but I'm trying to stay calm and mindful: I am worthy. I know what I'm doing. this will be fine. breathe. ..**General:** lately I play piano in the evenings to relax. my husband bought me a sweet electronic keyboard for Christmas professional-grade with weighted keys. I set it up in the bay window in our bedroom which faces a tree filled with chirping finches and the gorgeous San Francisco fog rolling under Sutro Tower in the distance. I've been playing since I was 5 and even have a music degree but during my heavy drinking years I dropped it entirely. that disconnection was so painful. it feels amazing to nurture that piece of me again.

Triumph: coping with a scary school lockdown at my kid's school without my first thought once it was over  being "i am SO getting wine after this!" ..Struggle: see above  ..General: relaxing by watching Survivor on hulu since I never watched them when they were current. Too busy drinkin'. 
TRIUMPH: I got to work on time today and was not feeling sick. I got all my clothes folded and now my room is no longer a mess that it has been since I've had to to move back home last year June...STRUGGLE: I'm dealing with out of the blue anxiety. I'm panicking because I'm afraid I'm goin to lose my conviction. I have quit for a month before and the only reason I did was because I was still under the illusion I had control. I also think I had too much caffeine. Any advice to help with panic?..GENERAL: I'm in love with Coke life. 90 calories with stevia! Also having trouble with my 6 month puppy potty training. To relax I've been reading and playing Pokemon moon. I also have Naruto Shippuden quede on Hulu which is at a very cute part with Naruto and hinata's wedding!
Triumph: Being the mother I was meant to be and that my daughter deserves. She deserves the best me and all of me and I'm able to fulfill that role now..Struggle: (This is a good one) Trying to keep up with her as she got her training wheels off- I've gained 8-10 lbs since quitting!.General: Going Paleo as of 2 days ago. My psychic energy and ability is coming back into fullness. I feel buzzed on life..IT ALL FEELS GOOD GOOD GOOD. Love to you all. 
Triumph: Went to my first professional sports game without drinking any beer  .Struggle: Went on a second date and it seems like the spark has already died  .General: I hope Russell Westbrook wins MVP
