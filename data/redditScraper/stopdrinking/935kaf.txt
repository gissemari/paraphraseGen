Hi All. I've been a long time lurker of this sub first time poster. ..As so many of us do I struggle with depression. I have been working with my Dr's and actively trying to manage it for a couple of years now. Several months ago I made it about 90 days without any alcohol man was I feeling great! Im excited about trying again and I'm more motivated than ever. I downloaded an app to track sobriety time I'm excited for my badge to show up excited to see the number tick up...Here are some of my thoughts on day 1:..* The tossing and turning at night with little to no quality sleep - yup....not gonna miss that..* The feeling of shame and self loathing I get after a binge....yeah....no thanks..* How about the poor way my body works in the bathroom while drinking? See ya later..* The extra weight I put on due to drinking and making poor food choices while under the influence....good riddance..* The embarrassing and sometimes mean things I say to people while drunk? Again no thanks..* All the money spent on the drinks? That will be nice to have back..* Night sweats.....holy smokes i hate those..* The super sensitive gag reflex I get when binging. Not almost throwing up from my mouthguard at night will be nice...  I'm sure there is a ton of other stuff I cant remember off the top of my head...Thanks for all the good positive stories here. They are really helpful to me. I hope that I can help someone else down the road and I'm sure I will need some encouragement at some point or another...IWNDWYT!
