Hi everyone..I posted this in AlAnon and I didn't really get much of a response and I saw on the sidebar that it was okay to post here if you needed advice and I am not really sure where to go from here. The good news is my Dad has been sober for **14** days!...**Some background first:**..My father is a lifelong musician (bassist) and addict. At 13 he started his first band and simultaneously began drinking and experimenting with drugs. This behavior escalated until he was doing meth living in his car and arrested in his 30's for theft. He entered a treatment center shortly after being released from jail and after completing treatment he chose to move to a different state to get his life back together. He returned home to CA one year later...He has never relapsed on drugs but his drinking has never stopped. His intake varies and he will even occasionally stop completely but then after a few months of being dry he thinks he can handle having one drink per day to 'take the edge off' or because 'it is Christmas'. It inevitably becomes unmanageable. My mother does not keep any alcohol in the house but this does not stop him from buying it and drinking it himself. ..Three years ago his drinking became the worst it has ever been. He would get DT's so bad in the morning that he needed to stop by a liquor store on his way to work (he was a delivery driver) or "irish" up his coffee just to get himself right. A friend and bandmate of his staged an intervention and even paid for him to go to a detox center. After this he was sober for about a year he and my Mom started working out and eating better...After that year had passed he started drinking non-alcoholic beer because he said he felt awkward socially to not be drinking when he played shows. I understood this but still felt skeptical and felt like he was still playing with fire because of how long he had been addicted but he seemed to maintain this behavior for a while. Sure enough his drinking ramped up again until finally he was hospitalized with pancreatitis - a direct result of years of heavy drinking. He was in ICU for 2 weeks where his Doctor told him that he needed to not drink anymore because only one more drink could inflame his pancreas again or worse - cause necrosis which can lead to hemorrhagic pancreatitis and kill him. This lead to almost another year of sobriety and that brings us to now...**Present:**..He recently received a promotion and has been under a lot of pressure professionally and (of course) began drinking "occasionally" again. The most recent excuse being his birthday coming up which was just on November 3rd. Previously when he has slipped the one positive thing was that he was very forthcoming about it even when he felt ashamed. This time around he stopped to get himself a bottle of wine on his way home and drank it all in one sitting inside his car. When he came inside the house my Mom smelled it on him and when she asked if he had been drinking he lied. After several questions (and changing his story several times) he finally admitted to everything crying for forgiveness. I mentioned his pancreatitis? Later in the evening he began experiencing the intense pain he had the first time around. My Mom has had it after so many years of relapse. She is also very ill herself with an auto-immune disease and suffering from a rare chronic pain disorder. She fights every day to just exist and has finally grown tired of the back and forth. She has given him an ultimatum of sorts and has asked him to choose sobriety (and maintain it) or she will find another place to live and will leave him. She adores him but his illness has affected her greatly and after his near death experience she cannot bear it anymore. ..**Advice:**.I have attended Nar-Anon and Al-Anon meetings in the past - and I hope this is not offensive to anyone here but I did not find them helpful. I am not religious and while it is nice everyone offers to pray for my Dad (and encouraged me to pray) I am more interested in things I can use in practical application rather than platitudes. ..I know that my Father's sobriety is his domain and his decision but is there anything else I can do to support him? I have offered to go to meetings with him but he feels the same way I do about attending. We are very close and I tell him how proud I am of him when he hits every milestone and I definitely do not judge him when expresses a desire to still drink. I have also encouraged talk therapy since his untreated anxiety helps propel and fuel his desire to drink. Beyond all this - I dont know if there is anything else I can do...I love my Dad more than words can say and it kills me inside to think of him not being around all the time (impending divorce or death). My husband and I are starting a family and about to undergo a very stressful period in our lives when we begin In Vitro in March. It pains me greatly to think of my Dad not being around to become a Papa. ..I could write more but I believe this is long enough. To close I'll ask this - What sorts of things did people in your life do that you felt supported your recovery?..TL;DR Dad is a lifelong addict. His life and marriage are hanging in the balance. What sorts of things can I do/say to best support him in the early stages of his sobriety?
----------immediate responses--------

Do you think he'd be interested in participating or even just reading this sub?  I've found it immensely helpful.  Also be sure to take care of yourself.  The only thing in your power to change is yourself.  Wishing you and your dad the best!
Personally there was very little anyone could have done to help me get sober. There is also nothing anyone can do to get me drunk...Sometimes interventions work but you have to be willing to set firm boundaries and stick to them if your father refuses help. If you do plan an intervention I would suggest getting professional assistance from a rehab center or counselor. 
I'm no counselor; this is just my best guess! ..Talk with your Dad. Try to get him to do most of the talking. Don't push any opinion assert any positions or get frustrated when he doesn't think or act the way you want him to. Remember that [one of the best things to help with addiction is connection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao8L-0nSYzg) and by simply connecting with him you'll be helping. I'm not saying that you should lie if he asks you an honest question I'm simply saying that your relationship with him is more useful than asserting that he needs to quit drinking which he full well knows already. ..Under this light participating here with people who "get it" about quitting and/or controlling their drinking has been immensely helpful for me even though the forum means people are pseudo-anonymous. If Dad seems open to it suggest he come here but realize that this forum won't work for everyone.
