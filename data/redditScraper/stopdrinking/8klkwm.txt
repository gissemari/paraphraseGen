My partner doesn't really drink so it was unfair to expect him to accept that I would go out and drink late into the night with friends especially when we've had issues in our relationship because of my frequent failures to know when I'd had enough for the evening. Well since I went on my hiatus this particular friend hasn't been very accepting or nice about it. Reading between the lines I believe he's unhappy he's lost a main drinking partner. And as Annie Grace mentions in her book "This Naked Mind" I think it makes him question his own drinking as well as feel guilty because I'm so adamant about being done with the drink. Well since I quit drinking he doesn't even invite me out anymore. I invited myself to the bar after work and had some coffee and soda water and he spoke appreciation for the gesture but almost seemed annoyed. I even offered to be the Designated Driver and I've still been left out. Secretly I'm relieved. There were so many times I was talked into going out and spending money I didn't have or felt anxious about being in the car if my friend were to be pulled over. I would wake up feeling like shit and regret would seep from my pores as I struggled to recover mostly from self-loathing.. Formerly I didn't know how to explain to my alcoholic friends that they were aiding in hurting my relationship and that we could still have fun hanging out during the day alcohol-free and help me avoid the unpleasantries of justifying my behavior to my partner. My particular "friend's" behavior has helped me realize that our friendship went only as far as the door leading outside of the bar. Sigh. Don't let the door hit you where the good lord split you.....IWNDWYT

It was sorta a weird mix of relief and annoyance and sadness when I started to see how my social circle diminished after putting booze down.  For a long time I thought I just wasn't any fun sooner but now I think it's more that I'm pickier about how I spend my time and who I spend it with.  It's kinda nice :-)
