Today is my 90 days mark. I want to say thank you all for being here for me through the whining questions concern victories and relapses. Being a member of this community this family has been [the difference](http://imgur.com/a/dPDWn)(there is my PCSing checklist in there for some reason - MY B) for me this go around and I really appreciate each and every one of you. ..I have loved being able to wake up and enjoy the [sunrise](http://imgur.com/a/gruVa) everyday instead of having a face-to-throne relationship with my bathroom haha. I have been away from our SD community for a while- just popping in here and there to check-in and say hello (and to check on my fellow NYE BABIES!!). ..I just wanted to share somethings that through this group's encouragement and inspiration has got me to do. I realized in this journey that I have lost my self somewhere along the way and finding who I am and who I ant to be has been fantastic! So sorry I am not around a hella lot anymore here is what I have been doing/have noticed:..Apparently I am not the only one [sleeping](http://imgur.com/a/tMQng) better in my family and I am sober enough to notice and snap a photo :). ..I was sober also enough to be responsible and take care of my [sick](http://imgur.com/a/4ayK5) puppies (one had gotten fixed the other decided to shit a rainbow - so we got her checked out lol). ..When I was drinking I had zero energy high Levels of anxiety and pretty bad depression. While I still have issues with these things I make an effort to be better. I see a therapist once a week - we are currently working on EMDR therapy (super interesting btw).  ..I have been able to get out of my house and [enjoy the weather hiking. I also have tried cooking boxing A LOT OF TEAS and started really getting into fitness](http://imgur.com/a/nI1Tj). I remember sitting on my couch just praying that I would make it through the night only to continue drinking the next day. Now I am up and about.... not everyday. I still have my days where my ass is glued to the couch and I just can't seem to function. However I an no longer sleeping next to a trash can checking my pulse thinking about where/when I can get my next drink. ..I used my crockpot for the first time in my life (have had it for years) and I cooked my first chicken - Didn't blow anything up or burn my house down - HUGE PLUS! When I was drinking I literally did NOT eat. At all. Just Sailor Jerry and a chaser all day. Maybe once a week I would have an apple.... then that first week hit. I ATE EVERYTHING IN MY ENTIRE HOUSE. For reals I think I drank a gallon of v8 mixed berry a day and def was at the grocery store daily. I was a bottomless pit haha. Now I have a meal plan and getting my health on check but jeez talk about a roller coaster...Although I live far away from my family I was able to see my new nephew [Cooper](http://imgur.com/x2TEYHr) via text...  I opted out of skyping for the birth - no thank you!  I mean really? Who even asks a person that?! I can see maybe a military spouse overseas or something wanting to see their first born but your sister-in-law? NNnnnnnnoooppppeeeee...Some other things I have enjoyed is seeing my face/weight/health improve with [before and after photos](http://imgur.com/a/iMefp). ..And if I haven't added enough photos already here are some more of the [adventures](http://imgur.com/a/rA3Di) from the last month. I quit my job since it was a toxic atmostphere and def did not help with my sobriety so I have had a lot of free time to spend with these two. I think they have enjoyed it also - maybe not the outfits but def the hikes!..PS. Have you ever seen a dog [watch tv](https://youtu.be/uUe7UiWObVU) or ["fly"](https://youtu.be/n2Ejmkw5RqM)? Pepper does...PPS. For those who know about my liver issues I still have issues lol. Go figure but they are improving... and that is all I am told via the doctor. No numbers no stats just "doing better". But it's something!..A special thanks to  u/dawoollyman u/Possibilitarian2015 & u/122HereIcome for checking on me AND to u/x_clarity_x for being my pin pal through it all!

Nice! Glad you're doing so well. 
What a fantastic post! Good job Red!
That's a lot of good living. Love the collage of photos. They really are worth a thousand+ words. I have nothing like this and would take me hours to assemble. Keep up the good work and good luck with your move. Us NY's Sobernauts have triple digits within sight. Sober on one day at a time.
This is how you do LIFE!
