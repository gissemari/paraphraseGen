I got into a huge fight with my hubby Saturday! To me it was such a trivial thing to argue over.....all it was was a mistake in medical billing. Yes this mistake was the fault of the hospital BUT they sent it to collections anyway! So all this happens on a Saturday when I can't call and try to fix it. He's yelling and screaming at me......how could I do this to him?? Really?? People get screwed by medical billing all the time. So since I couldn't call and take care of it until Monday I decided to drink......I know I shouldn't have and I tried to talk myself out of it but I couldn't fight him and my addict brain both at the same time. I didn't have any wine so I decided to drink the scotch we had and it wasn't just one drink either :( I didn't drink Sunday because I felt awful. Yesterday I was able to call the hospital and get things rolling to work out this mess. I know it will all work out in the end BUT he's still mad at me. We got into it again last night and AGAIN last night I drank and it wasn't just one glass of scotch. So here I am asking you all to once again read my relapse story :( I have requested a badge reset picked myself up and dusted myself off. It's time to get back to my sobriety journey......Progress not perfection right? IWNDWYT
