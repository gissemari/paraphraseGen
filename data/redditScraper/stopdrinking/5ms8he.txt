I haven't been to a meeting. I have little support at home.. I need to just suck it up and go.  I'm tired of living only with alcohol. Tell me to go to a meeting.

Go to a meeting!! ;)  Hopefully that helps!  I would love to not drink with you today.
Also not drinking today. Hang with me dude. Think about some of the things you ignore when your drunk and tackle some of them.
Go and come here after to share your impression! You're not alone ! Please  go :-)
Please go to a meeting! No need to white knuckle through this; I want you to find some peace &amp; relief asap!
