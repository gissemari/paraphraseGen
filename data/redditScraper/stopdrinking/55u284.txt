Thanks everyone for the encouragement about losing my job (and on the day of sobriety that I relapsed last time of all days!)..I am proud to say that I cried got angry felt scared for the future but I DID NOT DRINK. Feelings suck sometimes but at least I woke up today focused and getting my resume around...All of you helped me through yesterday. You always come through for those of us who need you. Much MUCH love to everyone here! Not drinking today!

GREAT JOB!!!  I will not drink with you today.
Strong work my friend!!..I will gladly not drink with you today!
Keep it up.  Just remember that when we are sober we can make it through anything.  And i mean ANYTHING. When you think that drink is sounding good call a sober friend or come to this board im sure you'll be able to get in touch with someone
I'm glad you're feeling better today. Focus on the resume and the one thing I'll add to that is: try to think out of the box. I actually used to revise my employees' resume's because they weren't including so many strong skills and talents...And as a side note: I lost my job in June; I screamed yelled hated etc.. I went into our IRC and chatted with a bunch of SDers - I am proud and happy to say that they saved me from drinking that afternoon. Today I realize that losing my job was a blessing in disguise. And of course I'm eternally grateful to SD!! .We're here for ya we've got your back :).
Awesome! Yeah feelings suck sometimes and they are even worse felt through a hangover!
Well done!!
Good for you-- lets stay sober again tonight!
