Well I just reset my badge though it wasn't updated anyways. I think I made about two weeks last time around without a drink. Then I spent the next seventy days drinking. At first it was only a couple beers at night then it was a six-pack at night and last night I found myself finishing off a 30 pack. I didn't fool myself into thinking I could moderate though this last relapse. But I'm not sure if it is better that I wen't back into drinking knowing good and well that I would be back to 30 drinks per day..I'm so angry at myself and I can see myself slowly sabotaging all of my relationships. I'm having scholastic issues; I'm supposed to be graduating college with a BA in IT next month. I don't know if my grades can recover. Strangely enough I can't be a full time student and full time alcoholic concurrently. .Nothing will change if I don't change something. .So going forward this time I'll try to be more vigilant on this forum. It really did help me while I was using it. Thank You for taking time out of your day to read this..As always advice is appreciated - and I look forward to talking with yall..It is April 27 and I won't be drinking today...EDIT: a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/43oppr/i_think_i_could_use_your_help/) to my first post here just for some history in the rare case that someone wants review it

I just posted as well - same issue - I am a heavy drinker and in university - and you are so right - drinking and getting good grades don't match. I won't drink today either. Day nr. 1 for me too.
It's good you're starting over.  The first month is really hard but 2 weeks is already huge it took me decades before I managed to do that so you're capable of doing it. What triggered you after 2 weeks?
