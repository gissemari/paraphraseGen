I posted earlier but I relapsed last night after only 9 days. I began thinking about things that are coming up that are sure to be triggers and I'm especially thinking about a one week trip to Paris coming up in early April. I've been to Paris a few times and I've always drank wine. Wine and cheese pairings yadda yadda. I'm going with a friend who drinks and we're staying with our friend who also drinks. I KNOW it's going to be hard. I briefly mentioned I was trying to do a "sober 30" to the person I'm going with and he pretty much said "why bother". We're all in our mid 20s and no one thinks I have a problem. I know that eventually I have to do this for myself and stop worrying about the others but resisting the social pressure is always difficult for me. ..Any tips for surviving a vacation would be much appreciated!

I'll be interested in following this one as well. I go fishing in NW Ontario for a week annually with my best friend and drinking is usually a central part of the trip. I equate being drunk with being relaxed in a beautiful setting but now know I'm relaxed because away from job and (to a lesser extent) family pressure. My buddy knows I'm not drinking but just assumes I'll drink when we fish. I need to set expectations with him early and - more importantly - myself that drinking for a week will really result in a longer-term relapse. So anyway I'm also nervous about an upcoming (June) trip and look forward to hearing the guidance more experienced members can provide!
