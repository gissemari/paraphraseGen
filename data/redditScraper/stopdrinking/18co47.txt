Hey I don't drink much out of respect for my dad so it might not be my place to say this but here goes...My dad was an active alcoholic and his dad was before him and many of his family members are too. When I was in middle school (I can't remember the year) he made the decision to stop drinking attended AA and has been sober for 8 years at least (I say at least because I can't quite remember when he stopped - I wasn't old enough to remember the exact date but I did recollect the significance). He never refers to himself as "recovered" but instead as "recovering". After finishing AA he joined a church which I believe he considers his new support group in some respects. In any event I consider it to be a great thing for him despite my atheist feelings as it gives him something to do and people to be around. .But here's my point: to those who are struggling with alcoholism but want to stop drinking you can do it. You really can..I don't have any firsthand experience with alcohol addiction but here're some things that I found helped my dad: .- Join a support group be it formal or informal as having mutual support can be a big boost.- Find something constructive to do to replace any time you might spend drinking. For my dad it was religion. For someone else it might be model planes or painting or music...This kind of stuff has probably been posted before but I just figured I'd give my two cents as I'm never prouder of my dad than when I remember who he kicked his addiction...Also if I'm wrong about anything please let me know - I'd rather be wrong and learn than be wrong and continue to sound stupid.

Your dad done good. Not only for kicking the habit but for raising a kid right. ..See many of us who we're raised by drunks don't have the values or insight you got from your dad at an early age. We have to learn the truth later in life after booze has taken its toll. If our parents were like your dad maybe some of us wouldn't be here. Obversely if your parents were like ours maybe you would be here with us. ..With all that said we are all here for our own reasons and there's no point blaming anyone. I just thought it was interesting how much insight you have at an young age [age - 8(can't remember) = younger]. ..Thanks for sharing! Tell your dad i wish all the blessings of Poseidon upon him.
