My day account is fucked up. I had nine months then relapsed at the beginning of June now I'm on day 4. Tomorrow will be the longest I've gone post relapse but fuck me the cravings are so bad today. ..I realized I'm not craving the release of alcohol necessary... because I don't feel much internal turmoil today... I'm craving the solitude and that type of thing.

I'm with you brother. I'm on two months which is the longest I've gone in nearly 10 years. I was completely fine with not drinking but tonight I've been really craving some ice cold bottles of beer. Had a real shitty week and have a few days off from work. ..I was doing great at first but now the grind of full time work and the sorrow of my non existent love life are really dragging me down. I threw myself back into boxing but breaking my nose twice in the two months I've been back have put paid to any desire to compete. Just started up Uncharted 4 and the desire to stroll on down to the shop for a few cold ones is extremely tempting...Only the thought of tomorrow's bench press and tri workout is keeping me from doing so. I'd be up into the early hours sipping beer if I did and my family would be *so* disappointed. No doubt weed would soon follow if I allowed beer back into my life. I just can't afford it. Financially physically or mentally.
