Hello everyone! I've been a lurker for a long time now and decided to share my story..I've developed a very unhealthy relationship with alcohol about 3 years ago. I went through some personal trauma and started to drink basically daily. After some months I already knew I had a problem but that didn't stop be from a further self-destruction. Eventually with the help of this sub I decided to quit because alcohol made me suicidal and I could not continue on this path any longer. I had many many failed attempts to quit (I've been clean for 5 months now) and I just wanted to remind you all that relapse is okay. Even if you are on your day one - you are doing great. It takes a great strength and courage to even come to this decision so you should praise yourself for doing that..What personally helped me with each relapse was "embracing it". I would ask myself "is alcohol really that enjoyable? is this really what I would miss in my life?". Definitely not..I think this helped a lot because I believe anyone who has been drinking alcohol for a while and cannot stop is sort of programmed on the unconscious level to do so. When you embrace the hangover and even your long bender...each time it becomes clearer that alcohol is not worth to be a part of your life. If you still kid yourself that moderation is what you wanna aim for...think about it. I personally think it's not worth a try..The most deadly drug of all which is also legal...what can you seriously miss about it? The hangover? Acting out of character blacking out upsetting people putting yourself and others in danger damaging your health? .Exactly fuck you alcohol..And anyone of you who made a decision to quit is my personal hero because you all as a community had a huge influence on my recovery and I am sure a lot of you can also relate. So thank you and keep it up!.I will not drink with you today :)..(Sorry for my English)
