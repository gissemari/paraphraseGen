So to those of you lovely people who saw my post yesterday about it being my second day of work it was called "Hard Day" I struggled a lot with training on the new software and felt like picking up some wine on my way home. Instead I came home and watched a bunch of tutorials on the software I was struggling with. ..Anyways heres an update on day 3 at new job: It was so much better. I'm so happy that I didn't succumb to my cravings last night. I wasn't hungover or fuzzy in the brain. As a result I killed it! I finished my own file today :) It literally took my 7 hours but I'm so happy. IWNDWYT

Updates are great- thanks and how cool are you with turning that hard day around!! 
Well done! Here's to many more clear headed mornings!!..Keep up the good work!
WTG!  That's great news.  IWNDWYT
Great job!
Awesome!!! Such a better outcome than showing up hung over and still frustrated! I love how much more time sober me has for learning stuff than drunk me did. (Speaking of which I should really quit procrastinating on Reddit and get back to my damn dissertation  )
Way to go! You rock my friend!
