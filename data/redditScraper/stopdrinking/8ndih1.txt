I spent my first sober anniversary walking on the beach with someone I love eating Ethiopian food and earnestly enjoying the art at LACMA for 4 hours. Never ever in my wildest dreams could I have predicted that my life would turn around and become genuinely enjoyable. ..For anybody struggling please know that it does get better one day at a time. I was an around the clock drinker who couldn't do ANYTHING without alcohol. My last drink/drunk was mouthwash and all the attendant side effects. I was a pathetic physically dying shell when I finally gave up the bottle...I'm no longer a shell and my physical health is mostly restored. I haven't thrown up on myself or blacked out or woken up next to a stranger in a year. I have a job friends and a future now. That is nothing short of miraculous...Keep coming back. The only thing we have to do perfectly is NOT DRINK TODAY!
