I've learned that I can't do this on my own. The fellowship teaches me so much. I don't get wrapped in memorizing literature or freaking out over the step work. It offers me an outlet to dump my shit instead of carrying it and stuffing it like I did for all of my adult life. More importantly there is ALWAYS at least one person who shares something that I can relate to and I really hone in to what they are saying and how they overcame it. I tried it on my own. Many many times. And each relapse was more devastating than the last. That's because I have learned that although I have arrested my disease it is in full throttle progression as we speak. Simply put if I relapse again I die. That's a fact. There's a huge difference between abstinence and recovery. I've been a miserable cynical dry drunk before and that's no way to live either. Exploring my behaviors and thought processes has really opened my eyes and put me on a road to enlightenment that is truly fascinating and rewarding at the same time. I have learned that with abstinence = I'm alive. With sobriety = I survive. But with recovery = I thrive.

You have leaned a lot in 90 days.  Engagement with others in recovery was the key to my sobriety.
Congrats on 90 days! Great job!
