I made a big leap last night and announced my sobriety to my small group of facebook friends and got a giant outpouring of support. I know some might consider that risky but these are the same people that were congratulating me on last semester's grades just a couple months ago. I figure it showed a vulnerable side and that even with all I had been able to achieve through that haze of booze I am still just a human with flaws. It just feels nice to know you have people by your side. There has also been something different about this time I have quit before and relapsed but somehow I now know that I can't go back. Maybe it was a lesson learned from that relapse or maybe it is all of the bad decisions flooding back into my memory that stops me from picking up that first drink. Whatever the case may be I am loving this new sober version of me and all of my recently acquired AA acquaintances. Thank you to everyone on here too I usually only hit up a meeting on the weekends and you guys and your posts are one of the tools that I use to make it through another week!
