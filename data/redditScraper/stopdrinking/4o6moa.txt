Wooo! 30 days and another chance to say thank you for the great support that SD has provided. By posting a list of the benefits I've noticed in that time maybe I can help to motivate those of you who are a bit further back on the road the same way that I have always been encouraged and motivated by the higher-numbered posters here...**Physical health**.* Constant lower back pain (that I was attributing to middle age) has disappeared.* Daily headaches have become far less frequent.* I was in the middle of a bout of kidney stone related pain when I quit. The grit and blood that I was seeing in my urine back then has disappeared.* My skin seems to be evening out with less red blotchiness around my face.* Energy in the mornings is hugely boosted. I have to get up at 5.45am every day to walk the dogs before getting ready for my commute. Where I previously had to drag myself out of bed I am now more often up with a bound and really enjoying the walks.* Horrible daily queasy stomach problems have disappeared.* Physical sensations are enhanced if you catch my drift ;)..**Mental health**.* Over the last 3 or 4 years I have repeatedly found myself struggling to remember a word or a name during conversation and I was (again) putting it down to advancing middle age. Now it's improved dramatically and I feel far more articulate and confident.* My general demeanour has massively improved. I used to just resign myself to being a fairly morose cynical pessimistic type of person. Turns out that was mostly alcohol related and I'm now much much happier and optimistic.* I am much sharper and more focused at work and I'm actually starting to enjoy my job again..**Life in general**.* The weekends are fantastic without alcohol. I get more done if I want to and I actually feel rested and relaxed on a Monday morning rather than tired and pissed off.* My relationship with my wife was always good but now it's even better because I'm not beating myself up about my failings or worrying about something rotten I said (or thought) when I was full of booze.* I'm saving at least  50 per week. That shit mounts up...Anyway thanks to everyone here for the amazing support and encouragement. There are always people reading who are taking strength from the things you say even if they don't respond all the time. ..I'm getting my head down and pushing on to 60 days but first I'll not drink with you all on this 31st day :)

Thank you so much for sharing. I have attributed a lot of lost my keys---can't remember if I told you this---have no energy---to aging too. After 15 days I feel better and your post makes me even more optimistic. 
Yay you!  I'm right at your heels as far as days sober and also feel amazing.  Thanks for the inspiration!
Congrats on your 30 days! Sobriety feels great. :)
I recently hit the 30 day mark as well.  Congratulations on the benefits and my the streak continue!
Congratulations on your star!
Congratulations on your shiny new star - It looks great on you!  Sober on my friend I'll not drink alcohol with you today.
CONGRATS!.
Over the last 3 or 4 years I have repeatedly found myself struggling to remember a word or a name during conversation and I was (again) putting it down to advancing middle age-ME TOO! memory is coming back and I am finding myself saying articulate things at meetings.. which is helping my confidence...! You go!.
Congratulations. Thanks for your inspirational post.
Congrats on 30 days :)
Thank you. This is very encouraging!
