I have vague memories of a dream I had last night where I made the decision to drink. I am not sure what motivated me but I remember the sensation of guilt and disappointment that followed. I remember thinking about resetting my badge. I think drinking has been on my mind more recently due to the fact that this Friday marks a year since I stopped...I have been struggling with my depression a lot this summer. I have been questioning my life goals and ambitions housing and work situation. I saw a psychotherapist but it was too expensive to continue paying out of pocket. I made an appointment to see a doctor in my network this month to discuss SSRIs and if I can be referred to a psychiatrist that my insurance will help cover...I think if I can properly manage my depression and self loathing then everything else will kind of fall into place; not be so angry all the time be more confident in myself feel good about the things I am doing. Has anyone here taken SSRIs after they stopped drinking to manage this sort of stuff and what results did you have?

I take Prozac. In my experience it works but only when not drinking. I also have dreams about drinking. I feel the guilt (even though it was a dream) after I wake up. Hope you get the information you need and know you're not alone!
During detox I was placed on specific medications (some only for use during actual detox). The one that I stayed on and works wonderfully for me is Lexapro. Of course I don't think any of my anxiety / depression would have been relieved without becoming sober. I'm glad to hear that you'll be seeing a doctor about this and I do hope they can help you. You should not have to suffer like this :). Please keep us posted good luck!
