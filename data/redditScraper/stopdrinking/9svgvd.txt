It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-----------------------------------------..**Struggle:** I am doing a  medical blitz  where I do a whole batch of medical tests and doctors' appointments all at once over the space of a few weeks. It's never fun because it forces me to really look at the things that are seriously wrong with me like my cirrhosis and my MS. (I've had an MRI of my brain this week and I'll be getting an ultrasound of my liver in a few days.)..**Triumph:** I won't give a triumph this week because I don't want the health gods to think I'm getting complacent.. .**General:** The following are sentences exactly as typed by medical secretaries in NHS (National Health Service) Greater Glasgow Scotland:..1. Patient has chest pain if she lies on her left side for over a year..2. On the second day the knee was better and on the third day it disappeared..3. The patient has been depressed since she began seeing me in 1993..4. Discharge status: Alive but without my permission..5. While in ER Eva was examined x-rated and sent home..6. Patient has two teenage children but no other abnormalities..7. The patient was in his usual state of good health until his airplane ran out of fuel and crashed..
----------immediate responses--------

I'm thinking of you and lighting a candle for you during your medical blitz. Your Triumph? Even with all of these challenges you're still sober and you're still our amaaaazzzzzing Mary and an awesome Mod!..**Struggle:**     Woke up with an ear/sinus infection. I work with patients all day long. An obnoxious woman came in and coughed/sneezed *all over the office* without covering her mouth. REALLY?! Can you please give a F about the rest of us trying to stay healthy?!..**Triumph:**     Besides the *patient from hell* work is going beautifully. I threw a bday party for my doctor/boss/bestie yesterday (yup he's all of that in one). Everyone was so happy! I feel stronger and more confident than ever :)...**General:**     [My Halloween Pic!](https://imgur.com/a/kfoeF1e).
\*\*Struggle\*\*: Still keep getting these feelings of sadness that wash over me and my poor SO has to deal with it. It's difficult I caused a bit of mess while drinking and I totally understand some people are not ready to forgive me (or might never be). AND I know that. But it continues to make me feel really sad...Though I still have friends losing some close ones really hurts and it's made doubly hard by knowing it's my fault...\*\*Triumph\*\*: Helped my friend paint her living room yesterday. ..\*\*General\*\*: Going to see Rocky Horror tonight and dressing up. Hope you all have a great Hallow's eve. 
Struggle: I made good use of my time this summer w/outside activities around the yard and garden. I do not have an indoor/cold weather activity. Need to find something to do during the cold months ahead...Triumph: Made major progress yesterday getting garden tools &amp; supplies stored away...General: I am sober and life is good! Someone once said..."Wherever you may be look when there is apparently nothing to see listen when all is seemingly quiet." I am grateful for serenity in my life. Peace
Mary I'll ask because we find small treasures in the most unusual places...Any good food at these hospitals lol? Had a friend who enjoyed the fresh berries and yogurt at one location small sandwiches at another...we shared a lot of food pics :)..*Triumph:* Off the Zoloft I was testing and feel like a million dollars. Didn't work for me and I like where I'm at. Sort of happy I checked it out. Each his own every drug different respect whatever works for you all. :)..*Struggle:* In a relationship and don't feel it. Enjoy doing things enjoy the physical presence and benefits nice to be wanted I just am not there emotionally. Owe it to her to be honest and move on. Doh!..*General:* This patient gets bored if he doesn't do anything lol. Rx is Halloween!!    
Mary thanks for sharing. Hang in there! ..
Struggle:  I'm struggling with my daughter's decision to date a man that has lied to her  about his age and about having a child. He finally came clean after a year.  He was caught texting her friend and asking for nudes. And yet she still wants to be with him. I struggle with telling her what she needs to do.  It is not in my nature to hold back...Triumph: I have not lost my cool I have not picked up a bottle...General:  I am having better and more conversations with my son.  He seems to have turned the corner and seems to be on the road to adulthood. So strange what would be normal advice does not seem to work in today's times. I find myself saying "Back in my day..." I don't mean to sound old!   Everything is so different from applying to jobs to going to school to getting an apartment everything is different..
Mary- Thank you thank you thank you!!
Struggle: personal life is/has been a mess for years bc of me..Triumph: night sweats are tapering off 
Good morning and good luck with the medical stuff u/sfgirlmary. My thoughts are with you. ..**Struggle** Work as always. Annoying coworkers as always. Feeling overwhelmed as always. ..**Triumph** Been cooking a lot of good things lately. Cooking &amp; drinking always went hand and hand so much so for me that the past 9 months I've pretty much handed over dinner duties to BF while I only make my own simple meals. I was very bitter about not being able to cook with a cold IPA nearby (like BF still does) or nice soothing glass of whatever wine would complement the sauce I was making. Very bitter indeed. But now I'm cooking again and it's great. Food turns out better since I'm not getting stupid while making it and I have more room for it in my tummy since I didn't get 3/4 full on booze while making it. ..**General** The winter darkness has descended over Minnesota. Time for lots of candles and hot drinks and movies under blankets!
Great to start the day with laughing out loud!   May all be well with you!
**Triumph:** I have a potential job to interview for! No guarantees that I'll get it or that I want it but it's still nice to have that opportunity. Climbing is also going pretty well. ..**Struggle:** It's still frustrating being in my position. My diet also isn't going great but I'm maintaining fairly well which is a plus...**General:** Happy Halloween!
Triumph: 666 days sober on Halloween! I got a good chuckle out of that. ..Struggle: I worry that I'm boring. I see all my friends going out and being social...I feel like I'm overlooked at parties and not interesting enough. As a woman I'm getting older and feeling a bit irrelevant. It's a weird transition from my wild party days in my 20's and early 30's. ..General: I really like Halloween I love the costumes and decorations. It'll be fun to hand out candy to the kiddo's. 
**S:**  Depression usually kicks up a few notches after day light savings time takes place.  So not looking forward to that...**T:**  Even though I feel ok now I'm not slacking on my self care  "because I don't want the health Gods to think I'm getting complacent".  This means taking my meds exercising taking time out for me showering! keeping my house picked up and the myriad of other things...**G:**  Heading back to my home town to take daughter trick or treating will likely be encountered by the ghosts of my past.
I hope all the test results come back with good news for you /u/sfgirlmary xxxx..*struggle* Kiddo is off on a three-day school excursion next week. I get pretty anxious about these things [what if there's a bus accident? what if the mine shaft they are touring collapses because there's an earthquake? what if the worst of the class bullies really hurts her? what if she eats something that triggers a major allergic reaction? what if? what if?] and also because I so rarely have even one night off parenting let alone two ole lizard brain is suggesting it would be prime time for wine because I'll be on my own at home and won't have to be up and at 'em for school run for two days. Oh FATS [fuck All That Shit]!..*triumph* I am learning to say no to unreasonable work demands from both the editor from hell and also just tonight from an occasional client who specialises in stuffing things up and then trying to make her emergency my emergency copywriting rescue job.  I'm no longer prepared to take on unreasonable requests from unreasonable people. This is HUGE for me - and I can do it because I have the confidence that my career and income can both cope with me turning down an invitation to insanity...*general* it's amazing how sparkly water with a squeeze of lemon or lime STILL tastes so damn good after 300 days of having it almost every night! *takes a big sip* yup. still tastes so. damn. good. :)..  
Hey /sfgirlmary I hope your tests go well. Sober living has got to help! .**Struggle:** Just the normal "static" in the Lifetime Channel: work worry about my 23-year old daughter getting her life on track still grieving the loss of my brother who died Oct. 1 from pancreatic cancer concern about my 90-year old mom's health..**Triumph:** I've gone swimming 5 days a week all month! Feeling healthier both mentally and physically.**General:** Trying to be PRESENT not worrying so much about yesterday or things I can't control..Happy Halloween SD Reddit friends!
30 days today.  
Struggle: 3 days in and dreaming every night that I drink and upset my husband. I have gone a weeks without wanting a drink and a few years without before. This time is different. We play pool 2 nights a week and obviously out of bars. I honestly don't know how to really play sober. I would drink to calm my nerves and deal with the pressure so tonight and tomorrow night will be interesting. Thankfully my friends and teammates know so I will have my support group with me...Triumph: every day that passes I want this more and more. I lost both my parents to this disease far too young and I refuse to let it happen to me or to let my future children go through what I did. I feel great still have my lows but I missed the sober life. I turned down drinking with a friend last night after a long stressful day. Its all about the small wins! 
**Triumph:** Things are busy at work and at home. I'm dealing pretty well with it. Even better I'm not feeling overwhelmed or over stressed...**Struggle:** I'm having a hard time being social and enjoying parties right now. I've been falling back into my withdrawn awkward uncomfortable patterns. What's interesting is that I've experimented with acting much more outgoing in some contexts this summer. I find that fun and not as tiring as I expect. So why can't I act that way all the time?..**General:** I could--and have--written similar sentences to all those examples. That creates some interesting issues when writing is part of your job...
Struggle: my partner is asexual and wants to lay off the sex for awhile to figure things out. We decided to open things up in the meantime so I can still get laid and have those needs fulfilled but I'm having a really hard time juggling my relationship with him fulltime work school recovery and everything else in life already and now it feels like I'm adding dating and hooking up on top of all of that.  I just feel so overwhelmed since I feel like I'm back on the "market" again and have to navigate that. On top of all that my partner wants to keep it "don't ask don't tell" so I'm having all these issues with the open relationship and I don't feel like I can talk to him about it...Truimph: For the last couple weeks I was getting gnarly cravings and suicidal thoughts again but I think thats all past. I'm feeling calm cool and collected again...
Struggle: I'm going to a Halloween party with a girl I'm really into and the urge to drink is strong! But I know I'd only feel sad and gross in the morning. I'd rather wake up fresh...Triumph: I've finished my portfolio for art school! And I'm two months from being one year sober  ..
Those silly sentences made me LOL - thank you - I needed that today!! I did the medical blitz earlier this year - it feels good when it's over. Good on you.  ...Struggle: dead car battery in the rain today..Triumph: My teenage daughter and I had a great hangout time last night and laughed a lot..General:  I'm grateful to be off the rollercoaster of craving drinking and guilting.
Thanks for the Doctor's Notes excerpts. I love that kind of unintentional humor especially wordplay. On the Jerry Lewis Telethons every year he had a guest performer who would say things straight faced where he used malapropism meaning he would interpolate the wrong word in just the right place so as to completely change the meaning of the line while leaving the "original" meaning apparent. He was hilarious. I just looked him up on IMDb and his name is (he's still alive at the age of 91) Norm Crosby.
Struggle: dealing with some low self-confidence right now :(. .Success: I've lost 10lb of fat in the past 2 months! ..General: lots of cute costumes out there today! 
**Struggle:** Recovering from the flu and my coworkers say "Stay at home don't get us sick!" and then are passive aggressive later when I dial into a meeting from my living room. Either you're with it or you ain't....choose one...**Triumph:** I joined the gym today just a basic old-fashioned gym. For 7 years I've been chasing fitness communities feeling the need to be included in *something -* Crossfit bikram yoga UFC etc.  And today I went in followed a workout on my phone left...and it felt GREAT.  Not distracted by anybody else looking a certain way wearing the right things talking about who's sleeping with whom.  It was wonderful...**General:** I've eaten 8 pieces of candy today.
**Struggle:** After a really long exhausting day had a couple small fires pop up at work this evening *after* I thought my day was done. The desire for a few drinks to just disconnect and put things on hold until tomorrow is the strongest it's been since I stopped drinking. ..**Triumph:** Instead of drinking made a few phone calls sent some emails and got a head start on resolving these work problems. Staying focused on completing a month...**General:** A handful of peanut m&amp;m's and netflix are good for relaxing...&amp;#x200B;
S:  I've got some anger built up.  I've never been to a therapist but I think it might help. ..T:  I bought a ring that I'll give to my gf in the next two weeks    Damn I love that little firecracker lol..G:  life is good and I know its gonna get better even when things aren't great because I won't be drinking 
Struggle: Had a few cravings around quitting time and the little voice trying to convince me to head downtown. Made it home sober...Triumph: Beat a hard deadline at work...General: Handing out candy is making me smile.
Struggle: I'm unemployed and running out of money. I'm also back on day 1..Triumph: I poured my alcohol down the sink this morning...General: I hope my sobriety sticks because Halloween would be a cool sober date.
Struggle: I'm not doing well at the social aspects of this sober journey. I'm kind of being withdrawn from friends and it makes me miss drinking. I know it's not the drinking I miss - but hanging out with friends and drinking are so intertwined it's hard to separate. Was especially hard with all the adult drinking going on. ..Triumph: I made it 70 days. Only a couple days away from my all time record. I also calculated that I've been sober for 51% of the time since I decided to improve my health last thanksgiving. That's pretty good!..General: nothing much. Really enjoying Black apps 4! Great stress relief for me.
