This is about my dad. He's 65 years old and has been a heavy drinker for most of his adult life but unlike many others he's got a weird drinking pattern...He does not drink everyday but once a month or so. But when he drinks it goes on for days sometimes beyond a week till he just cant take it physically. During those days he doesn't do anything but drink I've even seen him drunk by 8AM. And throughout it he doesn't not eat much maybe some juice a sandwich or two that we force him to eat. And the drinking does on till he starts puking. Even this doesn't stop him sometimes I've seen him puke and then drink again...This has really started to effect the people around him. I love him and I know this is a disease but sometimes I really want to take off from all of this. The only reason I'm still around because he is the nicest guy when sober and he has been of huge support me during my struggles (personal stuff)...I've spoken to him about going to AA but he straightaway refused hes not the kinda guy to accept his problem and open up to a bunch of strangers...I hate to see him this way and I'm sure this will kill him if he goes on like this. There are times I go his room to make sure he's still breathing...I need your help.

You're a caring person.  ..Alanon is a great resource.
You might want to reach out to r/AlAnon. It's a group of people who love an alcoholic but do not want the other person's drinking to negatively affect their lives. Or if 12-step isn't your bag you might try r/scienceandkindness. It's another great sub for loved ones dealing with someone else's addiction issues where they focus on the [CRAFT]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_reinforcement_approach_and_family_training) method...
Unfortunately if someone doesn't want to change you cant really force them to. They have to want to change. All you can really do is be there for someone when they need it love them and accept that they are going to make their own decisions regardless of how you feel about it. Its kind of just part of life. I know you said there isnt an alanon in your area but Im positive they will have plenty of free literature online perhaps some online chatrooms or ways to contact other people in alanon and other free resources for you to use on their websites. Best of luck.
r/alanon might be worth looking at.
