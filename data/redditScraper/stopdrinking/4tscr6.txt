day four sober after a particularity difficult relapse. struggling with honesty. Back to living with my parents (im 25). I had one last secret left and it is so ironic. I flew back to my hometown to get back into AA. I knew they would be taking away all my money. So I stashed $500 in one of my old hiding spots. Last time in recovery I showed them all my hiding spots for booze and drugs except one clever location. I went to a noon meeting and started the meeting talking about honesty thinking about this cash the whole time. Then of course I come home from the meeting and my mother says "sit down on the couch" I knew exactly what she found. I was honest with her. Give me some advice.

I'm not exactly sure what you're asking for advice ON...Are you asking should you have been honest? 
I too am confused.  Why is someone taking your money?

1. Is it true?.If it were up to me I'd ask the following question. " hi mum need new shoes please go shopping with me" If the answer is " of course luv" things would probably be ok..2. Is it kind?.it is tough love kind of old-fashioned. I know my dad would react exactly the same. .3. Is it necessary?. I personally think it takes your some of the descision that I have to make about drinking away from me and that one is mine to make wholly and complete. Also this money thing creates a gap between you and your parents who are just trying to help you.
