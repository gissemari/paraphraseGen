What AA does do correctly is focus on a solution and a solution that has worked for many. AA was not set up as a scientific research body but as a way to solve a drinking problem that confounded the people suffering from it. ..I think it is more helpful to focus on what works for you....  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|25|1|vnads|*Probably going to jail for a few years to anyone struggling with addiction.* by forgetbooze|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/23awzm/probably_going_to_jail_for_a_few_years_to_anyone/cgv8aoj)|.Please seek help. You're talking a lot about suicide and that's frightening. It's not the only way to get things back on track. People in this sub have done stupid stupid shit and they have come back from it. ..Don't do that one last stupid thing leave the stupid shit behind! ..[Putting this here...](http://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/comments/17gu7g/hotline_numbers/)...  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|25|0|ComeOutOfTheDark|*Summer alternatives to alcohol?* by TheDarlis|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/231n8j/summer_alternatives_to_alcohol/cgsn8cx)|.> Within a split second of noticing that the patio furniture was out I thought Aw shucks I wish I had my wallet with me so I could sit there and enjoy a beer!.> .> .> .> What the hell is that? I mean really? Did I mention that this is a COFFEE shop?..This is the first thing I've read on reddit in a long time that made me laugh out loud because it hits so very close to home for me..."What a nice day the kind of day you could kick back with a mojito...".."That's a beautiful sunset the kind of view you could sip wine to...".."That's a nice sound system in that car. Lets do some shots.".."I'm glad they corrected that mistake on our electric bill. WHEN ARE WE GETTING DRUNK ALREADY??"..After quitting I was astonished how easily that alcohol idea would slip into any fanciful plans I made.

Therefor anecdotal evidence is fine.  That "anecdotal evidence" keeps my kids in my life and a paycheck in my bank.  We are not looking to prove some theory with the scientific method.  We are trying to stay alive and happy.  I don't understand peoples need to argue this.  A 65 year old man broke down and sobbed in my meeting last night because he wanted to die and couldn't quit drinking.  If the fucking Easter Bunny gives him 3 clean days to feel good about himself then so be it.  ...  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|24|9|UncleKerosene|*".... once a cucumber becomes a pickle..."* by bismuth_83|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/236eem/once_a_cucumber_becomes_a_pickle/cgtv3g5)|.It's true that there is much bullshit in the rooms. But almost 10 meetings in 10 days and you've already got it all figured out not just for you but for all of us? All I can say is I was like that too and I'm not anymore. I hope your way works for you better than it did for me. It certainly seems to work for most people. Most people don't have a drinking problem or they have the kind they can fix with some other approach. My problem isn't like that....  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|24|5|Pussy_Money_Swedes|*This video is why I gave up alcohol.* by SabadoGiganteDeenz|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/232ubu/this_video_is_why_i_gave_up_alcohol/cgsvsh8)|.Emerging from an all too frequent alcohol induced comatic trance; inflicted with the sensation that the skull is clasped in a vice. The burgeoning beer belly incendiary with a cocktail of beer and spirits bubbles with corrosive bile. ..Rationality becomes stunted and fear permeates every pore indicative of the previous night's debauchery. The atmosphere in the room is toxic and the air is infused with the omnipotent fetter of booze...The normally welcomed sunlight becomes an irritating repellant and the presence of a pint glass usually reserved for drinking from has become a urine receptacle...Garments festoon the bedroom and Calvin Klein underpants have become a colostomy bag. ..The first signs of life come in an uncoordinated stagger towards the bathroom to kneel at the alter of Armitage Shanks and exercise the demons of excess...This ritual while releasing some of the tangible remnants of the session fails to alleviate a much darker sinister force; for the psychological trauma eclipses the physical. ..The Dionysian nature of the multiple day binge is the cause of this state. Alcohol is consumed recklessly; guzzled and gulped with Piscean like ability inspired by a pseudo-tradition of banter and revelry and consoled by tales of drunken irreverent past. ..Accolades are awarded to those who can consume without swaying erring or slurring. A totem of pint glasses is erected in triumph only to tumble and smash like the dreams of the drinkers. ..All this is preformed with minimal sustenance with the exception of the staple of bacon fries or dry roasted peanuts...The sad reality behind this is that alcohol has become a crutch to bu tress the gargler socially and equip them with false confidence and the ability to jettison all semblance of self-consciousness; just like armor safeguarding against the sharpened lance of truth. ..The byproducts of this gregarious enabling elixir are far from coherent conversations; moronic inanities and verbal puzzles are produced...Base emotions and animalistic instincts begin to dictate behavior as the mind becomes marinaded further; a feral like demeanor is assumed...Attempts to communicate with the opposite sex usually results in rejection and the ratio of pints drank to conversations held is dismal. Yields are negligent as the drunken wretch must stumble homeward with thoughts of reality and duty temporarily suspended. ..The severe thud and crash back to reality is cataclysmic. Thoughts become refocused and refracted when viewed through the skewed prism of the hungover mind. ..Positive IDs are constipated in the bowels of the brain. Trivial dilemma are exacerbated and magnified and the simplest of tasks become herculean...The sleuth gates open and the subject drowns in a wave of anguish and self loathing. An imaginary show reel of life is conjured; the cellulite catastrophe that unfolds is a tale of unfulfilled potential and wasted opportunities. Staring into the dark void of the future failure is prophesied at every turn.  ..Smooth shapes become sharp objects with the ability to pierce eyeballs and puncture the most buoyant souls...Sweat begins to flow as an intense heat is produced bizarrely while wallowing amidst arboreal chill...The head morphs into a throbbing bulbous state and the skin becomes invaded with blotches and capillaries akin to Nile tributaries...The ringing mobile phone resounds and resembles a harpy shrill; thoughts of any form of human interaction provoke anxiety apprehension and overproduction of gastric acids...The mental flagellation knows no bounds. A nebulous darkness descends and there is no refuge in the shadows. Any attempts to bind the shards of the fragmented soul are futile for this is the fear. .  ....    ..  ...  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|24|8|RogueVenus|*Does anyone not give a shit how many days they've been sober?* by smash_fantastic|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/231inx/does_anyone_not_give_a_shit_how_many_days_theyve/cgsibo0)|.First I counted days.
