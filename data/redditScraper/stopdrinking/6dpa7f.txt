Are you talking about a transitional living house that is part of a treatment facility an Oxford House a 3/4s House...? I lived in a woman's Oxford House for nine weeks after treatment but that experience is vastly different than a transitional living house would be...
My friend lived in a sober house during his recovery. I think it really helped him to be around other sober people. He now live with friends who are not but he is very much sober and happy plus they are not the sort of friends trying to make him drink or take drugs.
