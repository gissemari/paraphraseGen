I've been drinking every night since I was 18. It started as a recreational thing because everybody does it right? Except I really enjoyed the escape from all of my responsibilities. Drinking very quickly led me to a very dark palace that only perpetuated the habit. ..I've been drinking every night now for 5 years now telling myself every night that I will wait tomorrow because the anxiety is ruining my life. Tonight after a few days of serious hindsight I'm ready to quit. Tomorrow starts day 1. I'm ready to get my life together. I know I won't need help with it because I'm confident. Regardless I feel like this subreddit is a good place to share my progress and struggles along the way. My best to all struggling with this love hate relationship.
