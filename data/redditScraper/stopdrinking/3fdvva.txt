This time around at attempting sobriety I'm really trying to devote time to the steps. I've been struggling with them both in this subreddit and with my cohorts in the groups and my friends outside of them. In step three I am to turn  my will and my life over to God as I understand Him...But that's just the thing; I'm not a believer anymore. I've struggled with that for at least as long as I've been drinking. So I felt as though I tossed my will and my life into nothingness. I felt like I just sort of watched it there sitting still in the void. With all of the effort that I want to put into the program of recovery those pieces of me are just waiting there and I felt just as empty as I did before. I've been over the concept of a power higher than myself but the concept of God just isn't the same for me...So there is my will and my life given to nothing and I realize that I actually do want it. I want my will to be my will and my life to be my life. All of those years drinking and I never really gave myself the chance to make it my own and make it something that counts for something positive. My will had been the bottle and my life was not my own. Now that I was willing to give it up sober I wanted it back. So I'm taking it...I do have the will to stop drinking. I do have time left to do something positive with my life...I'll never have control over everything but I can learn to have some control over myself. It's my will. It's my life. It's my sobriety.

I'm confused.  Are you doing Step 3 or have you just decided Step 3 is not for you?
