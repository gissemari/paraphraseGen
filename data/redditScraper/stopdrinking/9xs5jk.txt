I'm 3 and half weeks sober and I just want to thank everyone here for sharing your support and stories with me. ..Someone told me that when you quit drinking you find the demons that made you drink. And I've found them. Drinking makes your brain be quiet for a little while. Numbs you to the stresses you have. But it only ends up giving you more. ..Everyday I'm like  this is longest I've ever been sober!  And everyday it just leaves me dumbfounded at all the things I can accomplish in a day without being drunk or so hungover I can't function. My body feels like it did back in high school. ..Drinking is just tied to so many social settings that I have to reimagine in my head without booze. How do I celebrate something now? How will my wedding look without me drinking?..It's oddly liberating to get to picture these things without alcohol because I'll actually be experiencing them. Not just looking for a buzz. I'm excited to actually live my life instead of being in a drunken haze. ..I still struggle with temptation but you guys help me stay strong. ..IWNDWYT

Great job !!! I celebrate with chocolate. I'm not going to say it's the best idea because I've lost no weight since quitting drinking because of it but when I picture my wedding reception it's all the chocolate fondue fountain instead of bottles of vodka now and it still feels like celebrating :) . I will happily NOT drink with you today .
