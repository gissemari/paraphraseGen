It was my sister's birthday and she wanted to go to Dallas to the drag show. I am a gay man so I enjoy going to the club. Sometimes it's the only place that I can find others like me and not worry about letting my gay hang out...Now I'm not going to lie there were a couple of times where I was a bit tempted but only briefly. Staying in the present moment really helped me pull through mindfulness...It was actually the best time I ever had going to a bar. I was fully present I wasn't nervous I wasn't obsessed with drinking or waiting at the bar the whole time or outside chain smoking because I'm drunk. Or get all sloppy and gross on some creeper. ew..The performers were amazing and I was even the responsible one able to drive us home when my friend got too sleepy...Now I know this is controversial and not for everyone. As they say check your motives and have a plan B. I had all of my tools in my toolkit and I didn't struggle this time but I had my gear ready in case something came up. ..Damn it's good to not drink. Just wanted to share. Thanks.

I am going to a drag "gospel brunch" tomorrow morning. I love drag shows and don't want to give them up just because I got sober. I am going to bring a sober friend order coffee and OJ and brunch and enjoy my time. 
Congrats on having a fun sober time - and congrats on 155 days! 
Everybody's different but for me going to the bar would be fine if there was entertainment. The issue is when drinking *is* the entertainment so if you're sober you're not being entertained. Drag shows comedy nights that sort of thing would be safe for me I think. Sounds like it was for you too!
Sounds like a good time was had by all and you stayed sober -- how can that be controversial? :)
