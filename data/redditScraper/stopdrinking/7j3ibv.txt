This is probably the longest I've been sober since I had my first drink somewhere around junior high 15+ years ago. Crazy (but bit sad at the same time.. I started so young that most of my life until now has been more or less about alcohol)...To be honest it hasn't been as difficult as I thought but I think I wouldn't have made it this fare without by partner. He keeps my mind elsewhere and has been involved in planning all kind of non-drinking fun activities together instead of hitting the pub every weekend. If I had been alone I think I would have had much harder time...On the other hand I've noticed that now that I've been off from booze for 3 months or so every now and then I'm craving a drink - just a glass of wine in company of friends thinking 'just one won't hurt..'. I think it's a sign I shouldn't let my guard down. During the past months I've learned that I am not one of those who are able to moderate (is there really such thing as moderation??) and it's better for me to stay completely sober...I originally came to SD around a year ago when I was first starting to think about quitting. It's been a help to find out there are so many struggling with similar thoughts and experiences. Thanks all!

Congratulations! Fantastic accomplishment especially all that you've learned about yourself...Yeah I've been tempted to have a drink here and there. Was pretty strong last Friday. But I just sat with the feeling and craving didn't fight it. Then I thought about ALL that alcohol has cost me and all the problems it created. ..Craving went away pretty fast and I thought "It's just not worth it."..So thanks for posting. It's a great inspiration. :-)
Inspiring!
