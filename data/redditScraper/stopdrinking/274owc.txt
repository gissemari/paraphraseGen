Just wanted to check in and say that I really enjoyed being sober for 10 days but now feel anxious bored "like a tool" missing out and plain. I know this is just a temp phase but wanted to share it nevertheless...Plan to make it to at least 40 days pure on willpower and then go from there. 40 days because that's how long it takes for new habit to kick in. ..P.S. You guys here are awesome.

Continued good luck.
Hi. Willpower is a myth when it comes to being sober. What helped me was having a counselor and involvement in AA. With that support I learned how to change behaviors and live a happy sober life. 
I've heard it was 21 days...I don't tend to believe that stuff doesn't matter if it is 10 or 90 if the true intent isn't there it doesn't matter.
For me day five to day twenty five were probably the hardest. ..The first few days were Ok because my reasons for quitting were still fresh in my mind. Once that faded I went through a period of questioning my decision daily. Sometimes hourly. ..In the second and third weeks I mourned the loss of alcohol. ..And then I just accepted. And everything got a lot easier. ..Now I feel the benefits. They're tangible.
