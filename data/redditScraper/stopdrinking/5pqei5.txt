I was sober for the whole experience. Can't imagine the guilt I'd be feeling right now if I'd been passed out somewhere like the selfish asshole I'm putting behind me...For those struggling today life really does turn on a dime (stole that from Stephen King). I can't tell you how worth it it is to experience it without alcohol. All my best- xJT

i'm so sorry for your loss. i knew that i was going to be ok when my ex-fil died at my day 13. my response was "i'm so glad i am sober so i can handle this for my ex and my daughter." not "i need/want a drink.". everything is so much more manageable now. take care.
Drinking does not make bad things better just delays facing up to it...Well done...I'll not drink with you today.
