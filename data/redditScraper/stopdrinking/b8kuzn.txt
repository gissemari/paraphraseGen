I'm super embarrased with myself. I'd made it to double digits and I relapsed hard. Like hard enough that my girlfriend found me passed out in the elevator of our apartment building. I'm glad she's the one who found me. I feel like such a fool. I felt like I was doing really well and I was getting it under wraps. I reset my counter which just brought me more shame. I hate being this person and I just wish change. Back to one day at a time

No shame man! Don't beat yourself up. I reset dozen+  times. It's part of the process. It really is. Learn from the resets. Make a plan of what to do next time the urge to drink comes. If you want it bad enough...Sooner or later sober or what ever you want will happen and sets in. I will not drink with you today!
Nobody finishes a video game on their first attempt. They need to go through it multiple times in order to learn and prepare adequately for the dangers. But the ones who are disciplined and keep trying and learning ultimately achieve their goal...Feel no shame and get back to walking your path.
