I stopped drinking for 14 months. I drank again for nine. I am back at six months sober. It's been good and bad and indifferent. I can't say that I'm in the best place of my life but I'm not in the worst either. And the one thing I'm certain of is that alcohol has no place in my life anymore...So for anyone who has relapsed or who is scared to come back only know if you do come back you will only be treated with kindness and respect. ..Not drinking can be HARD. Alcohol is everywhere. People talk about alcohol. Plan their lives around it. It is advertised everywhere. From work events to socialising with friends - it is everywhere...BUT alcohol can destroy lives. It nearly destroyed mine and many people around me. I've seen the damage it can do - to people;s health their mind their relationships their sense of worth...It's ok to admit you don't want to do that anymore. However you want. And it's ok if you fall back into and then get back up again...There is a whole wonderful world out there that doesn't involve drinking. Here's to another six months...&amp;#x200B;
