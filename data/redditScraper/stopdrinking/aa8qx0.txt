I live in a country where its common that people drink daily...Because of this I also started to drink often but it didn't go well. Now clean for one month and already feel that my soul is coming back. I just want to tell everyone out there who is struggling that its worth quitting and it gets better after only 1-2 weeks.  ...My new years resolution is to keep it up. Can't wait to feel more positive effects of sobriety!  Who else is on?!..&amp;#x200B;

I'm down to not drink today! :P
I'm struggling. I'd hoped for a sober Christmas but that didn't happen. I'd love to be sober in the new year. Drinking sure didn't make crummy 2018 any better. .Thanks for this post. It's great to hear others doing well. Good on you! 
2019 will be my third year of writing down a very specific plan for what I want to accomplish and correcting my problem drinking will be on it.  ..The past two years have included financial social and health goals but refused to acknowledge drinking as a health goal.  2017 was a year of rebuilding life after domestic abuse.  2018 was a year of rebuilding career and finances.  2019 will be a year of rebuilding health and happiness.  So I'm with you on this.
I'm definitely in.  I enjoy getting my soul back!  
I am going for an alcohol free 2019
I also live in a country where it's common that people drink daily.  I will join you in 2019.
