I don't remember some parts of last night but I do remember texting my ex-girlfriend and other people who I shouldn't be talking to. I said some awful things and I don't even want to look at my phone today to face the aftermath...This is a huge problem for me and the main reason I stopped drinking. I have absolutely no filter when I'm drunk and it has ruined many relationships. I don't drink to "have fun" I drink in order to give myself permission to do things I know I shouldn't...I'm hungover and feel generally awful.

It sounds like you recognize that you are repeating the same behavior when you drink and that you need to stop drinking but you are having a tough time sticking to that decision. Sounds familiar! What do you think made you decide to drink and if something similar comes up again how do you think you will handle it? 
I used to be addicted to building sandcastles and kicking them down again - I'd get sober get my life back on track and then do something to mess it all up again (i.e. relapse). I acted like this because deep down I didn't like myself very much. I also had a 'fuck-it' button that would triggered by the thought 'what is the point?'..The solution for me was to develop some self-compassion (so I no longer needed to 'act out) and find my purpose in life. .
Good glad you feel awful! Just think if you felt great you would do it again!
