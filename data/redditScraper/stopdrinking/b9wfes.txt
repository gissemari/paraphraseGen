It will be my first time going and third time planning on going but cold feet got the best of me.  I have been struggling for the past 5 years with my self centered alchoholism that has greatly strained my relationship with the person I love.  About 6 months ago I spiraled even harder getting into the habit of a 6 pack a day (if not more) bringing my self worth and mental health to a new low.  The hardest part so far is being honest with myself.  I am an alcoholic.  I do not like being drunk I use it to mentally check out when overwhelmed.  ..I say im going to go to AA to prove I am serious and for support but I have no clue what it truly entails.  I'm apprehensive to the faith based approach because I struggle with my own spirituality. ..I am ready to change and start recovering but it is really hard.  To those who have done the 12 steps what is AA really like?.

It is amazingly uncomplicated...There are links on the sidebar for more in-depth descriptions...Basically -  it's just a group of people who want to be sober.  They sit have coffee (or similar) and mostly talk about getting sober being sober and supporting anyone else who wants to be sober...Each group has its own personality.  I visited numerous groups to "sample" the group vibe before I finally found my two "tribes".  ..Anyone can walk in the door.  Everyone is welcomed and warmly embraced.  (if not I would go to another group!)...When I go to a "new" group I show up about 15 minutes early so I'm not walking into a room of people .....  I walk up to the first person I see and say "Hi I'm PG and I'm new here how does it work?"..They'll show you around....   ..If you let them they will introduce you to others by first name...At the beginning of EVERY meeting they read some narrative and it will include the following near the start:  "Is there anyone here attending their very first meeting or from out of town that wants to identify themselves by their first name only?"..You are not required to identify.  However it is courteous...If you let them know it's your first meeting they USUALLY turn it into a "first time" meeting and go around the room sharing what brought them in the door the first time...You can share.  Or not share.  Talk or not talk.  You can say "Pass" if you don't want to say anything...That's it...Don't get caught up in the spirituality business...let me know how it goes!
I can confirm what Prevenient_grace said. Really no need for stress.
