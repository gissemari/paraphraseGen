So last week I hit 6 years of continuous sobriety.  My 17 year old put a post on FB with a picture of a 24 hour AA coin congratulating me and saying some very nice things.  Of course the result of this was not only all several hundred of his friends now know I am an alcoholic but so do all of my friends (many of whom did not already know).  **THE HORROR**  Here are a few of the things that happened in response to the post:.. - Every message was one of encouragement congratulations and uplifting to me.  It was pretty nice actually... - 5 people who had no idea about my history reached out to me privately to share either their own personal struggles with alcohol or the the struggles of someone very close to them.  I think they were relieved to have someone they could talk to about this... - Last night my son comes home and tells me that one of his best friends confided in him yesterday that her mother is an alcoholic.  She has been trying to get sober for the last 3 years and is struggling.  She tells no one and it is a huge family secret.  Her mother does not go to meetings or try to get help.  She is committed to keeping this a secret and trying to do this alone.  Apparently it is not going well.  This young 17 year old girl said to my son yesterday..."how is it that your dad is so ok with everyone knowing and he isn't embarrassed?"  I asked my son how he responded and he said he just told her that is the way I have always been about it.  For the last 6 years there never has been any shame guilt or negative feelings.  ..Being an addict or alcoholic is hard enough on its own people.  Adding guilt shame embarrassment secrecy etc to the mix only makes it harder for us to succeed and get better.  People will ask me from time to time how I have done it and one of the ways is that I have been blessed to learn the power of **acceptance.**  I accept my disease of alcoholism and because of this I am able to seek help and guidance to fight it every day...Anyway I just wanted to share this with some of you today.  I  hope you all have a great day.

amen. rock on.
Amazing.  And by not hiding your alcoholism you are putting yourself in a position to be helpful to someone who is still struggling.  Using your disease for good.  Amazing.
Thank you. I keep waffling back and forth on this and a recent "back" let me let my guard down. Openness and acceptance is and had been working for me for over 2 years; oddly it was in front of complete strangers that I'd never see again that I got shy about my alcoholism and tried to "fit in" ...Have a wonderful day knowing you've helped at least one other...I will not drink today..
Thank you!  I'm not ashamed but still working on the acceptance.  I'm still noticing that I have a semi-active voice whispering that maybe I didn't go past the point of no return (didn't actually turn into the AA pickle) and that I could maybe drink like a "normie".  I just nod and smile and commit to not drinking today.  Thank you for sharing this experience and helping us find permission to accept without shame.
Thank you for this and congratulations on 6 years! Your son seems to be as wise as you are.
I think this message is so important! I don't go shouting from the rooftops that I'm an alcoholic but I have no issues sharing what I've been through and the way I now live my life. ..Congratulations on 6 years and thank you for the part you play in this community. 
Congratulations on 6 years of life...There is a huge freedom in not having to hide being a drunk or dope fiend. ..Amazingly everyone knew I was an alcoholic before I did.  Now most of the people I know don't believe I could ever have been like that.   Thankfullytoday they won't get to see me that way either.
Great post. Beautiful. Thank you for this an important lesson I need to incorporate better into my own life. Acceptance.
This is great. Congrats!!!..I think alcoholism is one if those things that needs to be talked about. Pretending it isn't real doesn't do anyone any favors.
Shame and secrecy are the life blood of alcoholism.  Remove those and it gets a lot easier (at least it did for me).
great post here. good for your son for being so mature
This is wonderful. Chronic shame is such a useless thing isn't it? You're making open dialogue possible by being so open and that's a powerful thing. 
What a wonderful post like everything I see you share here. I really admire your attitude. Congratulations on your six years!!
Congrats. Problem shared problem cut in 1/2. 
Than you for sharing this. It helps with my thinking about alcoholism the label the stigma etc. that at first I was very worried about but haven't been too concerned lately. Congrats on your six years! 
This right here! I believe to the depths of my soul that the acceptance of this disease is the key to living a full life in recovery. I've been around this for a little bit and that is the one common denominator I see that makes the difference between enjoying being sober and just not drinking. You and many others on here are a perfect example of how something so simple yet sometimes very hard can make such a difference. It took me awhile to come to acceptance but once I did it changed everything for me. 
Congrats on six years!!! This week I've told a couple friends that I'm an alcoholic. One posted on his Facebook wall that he had two months sober. I sent him a congrats message and told him that I was sober as well and sent him a list of my favorite meetings.  He got really excited and wanted to tell his boyfriend who is also a friend of mine. I said that was fine.  I realized that I didn't care and was actually proud of my sobriety.  It's also nice knowing that people in my friend group know so it's not awkward when I turn down drinks in social situations.

Congrats on six years that's amazing and encouraging!  I just hit six months but unfortunately am not getting the acceptance you are.  When asked why I wasn't drinking at a party (first week sober) and I honestly replied "mostly due to my crippling alcoholism" people didn't know how to react just shuffled in their seats and kept drinking.  This has been the norm. I dont care if they drink and I've never told anyone that they need to stop/slow down just that it's not for me anymore...I don't get invited to parties anymore.  I think my sobriety hits too close to home for others so they'd rather cut ties with me than have me make them uncomfortable. 
This was the most inspirational post i have seen in a while.  I got sober for my kids. My oldest is 7 today. I hope that why my son is as old as your son we can be as honest and open and loving in our home. This is true inspiration for how I want to model my family.
Congratulations on 6 years that's amazing!
Great post! This will help a lot on SD.
Congrats on Six Years; you're an inspiration Nika!    ..It could be because I'm older but now I accept the fact that I'm an alcoholic and cannot drink.  I really only remember one time (and it was recent) being basically grilled "You don't drink at all? Really? Not even wine with dinner?  ...etc.."   Nothing shuts a person up faster than saying "No I'm an alcoholic. I.do.not.drink!" lol!..Many Blessings and thank you for being You!!.
Thanks Nika!  I rarely feel embarrassed or ashamed about my alcohol abuse and while I don't shout it from the rooftops I am open if it's appropriate possibly helpful or I want to be trnsparent with someone.  I feel more ashamed about the behaviors I do unconsciously that hurt others.  My recovery these days is more about that than worrying that I'll be tempted to drink.
Fantastic story. You are an inspiration!
Congratulations.  Your son must be so proud of you.  Also the openness you have with him is healthy supportive and will help him to lead an honest and addiction-free life...I come from a family of highly functioning addicts/alcoholics.   We all have two personas-- the perfect one the world sees and the more complete version.  Having two version of yourself leads to guilt shame and secrets and constantly constantly having to keep your guard up.  Your honesty and openness will make it easier for your children to be themselves and accept themselves (flaws and all).  ..Thank you for sharing. .
I have to say that I have struggled to tell ANYONE aside from my wife that I have quit. I don't really know why probably the stigma attached to the label. Maybe it's the part inside of me that refuses to believe that this really is an absolute problem and that maybe I can find a way to drink in moderation at some point. Maybe it's that I don't want judgement. That said I really hope that when I hit months or years on the old badge counter that I can be a voice to help people without feeling like I do now.
Love it!! I'm so glad the results were positive all around!!
Hey Nika!! Congratulations on 6 years! I'm so happy to see this post today. When I think of the 24 hour chip I think of your kindness and generosity in sending it to me and how I always carry it in my wallet wherever I go. It is a source of strength and encouragement and I will always cherish that!..What a fine young gentleman your son is. At 17 he is mature and wise; aware that you have set an example of not being ashamed or embarrassed by being an alcoholic but have learned to be blessed and have power to accept it. I accept my disease I admit openly that I'm an alcoholic and I find it very interesting when people sometimes shoot right back with "yea I know I have an issue with alcohol too but I don't know what to do". Of course I offer feedback of trying meetings coming to SD and seeing a doctor to begin with for safety reasons. I hope that someday I can be a source of inspiration and strength just like you are for us here at SD!..You dear Nika ROCK! Congrats :). 
My father was a drug addict and never accepted it even though he went to rehab three times and failed. I was never ashamed of my father I just wanted him to get help and stop using drugs. You are being a good father in my opinion.
This is uplifting as hell man. Thank you!
I often hear about the whole "mental health awareness" thing and don't really pay it much mind.  But I guess I've got a mental illness. ..In truth though I really HATE to acknowledge it.  ..I remember one psych asked me one day: "Were you dropped on your head as a child?"..I DO feel ashamed.  I can't help but feel responsible for where I am with alcohol addiction.  ..
Congrats on six years and thank you for all of your contributions here.
That's interesting. I was diagnosed with depression a long time ago and I dealt with that by being super open about it everyone knows and it has opened many conversations with friends about themselves or their loved ones.  Meanwhile alcohol has been my (not so) secret shame....it never occurred to me to be as open about it as I was about mental health. 
This is an amazing post!
I've been waiting a year to tell my parents. I'm not really ashamed but I want it to be good news an accomplishment to be celebrated. i know they would help if I needed it but I am doing just fine and excited to let more people know. It will be a relief you're right.
Wonderful!!
I'm still embarrassed of my alcoholism but I suspect that is mostly because I want to feel confident I won't relapse (and trust me I know I should never get 'confident').  I am really impressed Nika thank you very much for the post.  I hope to get that courage as I get days under my belt.
Me too! I have never made a secret of it. I have even put AA service work on my resume before. I have always figured that I was not too damn anonymous crawling down State Street in Ann Arbor puking so why would I try to keep it a secret now that the above scenario is fairly unlikely?..Six years is a big deal! Congrats!
"Like"
Thanks for this - I'm struggling with **THE HORROR** right now and it's wonderful beyond words when somebody I respect and admire writes something that reminds me I don't have to do that to myself...Really considerate of you to time your post with my existential needs. How'd you know?!..Congratulations on 6 years and on raising a pretty neat son. You're an inspiration. I will not drink with you today.
You know what helped me a lot with quitting the life? Realize that I'm me and part of that is that I'm addicted to booze. And that's ok.
I love this. Thank you so much for sharing!
I failed hundreds of times over 25 years trying to stay sober. I waited until I had a year of continuous sobriety before I felt confident enough to share my secret. Thanks for sharing all the good things that can happen when we release control and accept.
Thank you for sharing this and congrats on hitting your six year mark.
Fuck man.. I needed this. I'm  only 24 but I haven't been sober in 8 years.. tomorrow I'm going to not give in.
This was so heartening to read. Inspiring. Thank you.
6 years?! Wow Congratulations Nika!!! 6 years is a number I can't even picture yet that's amazing...As far as hiding my alcoholism goes it's great to be "out of the closet." I'm not ashamed to be sober why would anyone be? Ruining a celebration because your drunken-self decided to start bawling and breaking shit in front of your in-laws now *that's* something to be ashamed of. But there shouldn't be any embarrassment about getting help for and coping with this disease...I'm an alcoholic with almost 1 year sober and I'm proud of that!
Keep on kickin ass Nika and thank you for being a great member of the SD community :)
Thank you for posting Nika and well done on 6 years. Awesome!..I think you make a very important point regarding acceptance. Much of this year has been about me accepting the problems I have with alcohol. I have accepted that I'm better off not drinking at all don't miss drinking and I'm glad I'm no longer chasing the impossible dream of moderation...Where I do struggle at the moment is in the label. The mental picture that is painted when the term alcoholic is used is not how I was so I don't label myself as one. The question is am I holding myself back in some way as a result?...
Congratulations on 6 years Nika!! And I'm no less than amazed by your courage in being so open about it. You're certainly right--there is no reason to be ashamed--I wish everyone thought this way. I used to think I was a 2nd class citizen but no more. Really it has swung the other way and now I feel blessed to be a recovering alcoholic for all the positive change it has wrung out of me that I never would have otherwise made...Yet I cannot bring myself to advertise it (intentionally or not) or have it advertised or allow it to be broadcast publicly. I've certainly toyed with the idea and often say I'll do it after I'm retired and no longer in any spotlights. So I think it's pretty gutsy and fearless to do that therefore you have my admiration especially when I read of the positive effects that have resulted. ..A degree of stigma still remains unfortunately though it seems to be decreasing with every passing year. I hope that someday being an alcoholism survivor is equated with things like being a cancer survivor. Until that day I will likely not possess the courage to be so open about it. I think that if it were *only* about me and overcoming my disease and no others stood the chance to be adversely affected (it's a long story) then maybe. You've given me much to think about. Thanks a lot for stirring the pot in me head Nika! :)
6 years is amazing. Something to be proud of. I will not drink with you tonight
Hey thanks for sharing this! Embarrassment is still something I struggle with but I'm slowly getting better. This is a really helpful post to read.
Damn! That third bullet brought tears to my eyes.

That's amazing congrats! I think a big thing for me over the last year was accepting my alcoholism and stopped being embarrassed by it. I just see it as a part of me and not as a good or bad thing just a fact about myself. If anything addition has let me to be more honest with myself which is a great feeling. Congrats on the continued success and thanks for sharing!
