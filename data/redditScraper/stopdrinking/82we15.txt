Went to a work dinner. Afterwards I was invited for a beer with a new colleague which I hastily declined (hopefully it came across as polite). I feel a little bad because I would have liked to have gotten to know this person better. But I promise it's not as bad as I'd have felt if I'd relapsed again so soon. Just needed to get that off my chest. I will not drink with you today!

That's a hard test so early on. You must feel so happy!
  
Well done! X
Well done. Inviting them out to lunch is always a healthy option.
Great job! :) .IWNDWYT
