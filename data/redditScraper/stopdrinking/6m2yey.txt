After 50 days sober  I ate pavement. ..Doing this differently this time.  I've reached out to friends and asked for help. It was humbling but necessary.  I went to my first AA meeting  saw a lot of familiar faces there (including my boss!). It's scary as fuck but I feel very supported.  Cats out of the bag now.  ..Day one again.  I missed you guys <3

Welcome back.  Glad to hear you've reached out.  I won't drink with you today.
Just remember that your boss was probably thinking "oh shit the cat's out of the bag now".
Welcome back glad to have you here! :)

Really glad you are back because we can give up on anything else but not on sobriety this is a matter of life or death  at least for me it's.  Best wishes hugs!
