I was homeless and depressed for so long. But in that time I got a job bought a car started really understanding why I drank. I'm also bipolar and this past week long bender came in part because I was crashing after a period of mild mania. I've accomplished so much and then made the poor decision to drink to deal with getting overwhelmed. ..I'm writing this because I want to hold myself accountable for my actions. I've known this community existed for years but I wanted to do it all on my own. I'm reaching out to my small support network locally but I think I need the help of others. The posts here are really helpful. ..There's this voice in my head that tells me everyone hates me that I'm a loser all kinds of awful things and I drank to make it stop. Obviously that didn't help anything. ..So today is day one again.

Good for you /u/nurburg.  The simple sober actions that I describe at the [Baby Steps post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) helped me come back from a relapse and a bipolar disorder diagnosis.  
Welcome back friend.  I like you.

What's past is gone. I try my best to focus on today. I really have to focus on changing my inner monologue. It has gotten easier for me over the years and I am mostly able to quiet the negative thoughts and replace them with a more a realistic and hopeful picture of myself and the world. ..
You're not a loser . Keep trying. 
Just remember that you don't start over. Well except in how many days in a row.  :)  Take what you've learned up to this point and keep going. You got this.
Reaching out is a great way to get help. It's really hard to do this on our own but unfortunately most of us try that... It can be frustrating to relapse - hell I did it a ton - but if you can learn from the experience then maybe there's a silver lining. Good job on starting out again. No matter what day we're on we're all working to stay sober *today*. Keep it going!
I'm restarting after 5 months sober myself. There is hope I truly believe that.
You are in the right place friend. One day at a time. 
&gt;There's this voice in my head that tells me everyone hates me that I'm a loser all kinds of awful things and I drank to make it stop. Obviously that didn't help anything...I have that same voice. It's okay. You're none of those things just like I am none of those things. What about that "other voice" ? The one I have given more time to is the one that says quietly and assuredly "It's okay and it's going to be okay." I have to take time to hear that voice most days but I do hear it. Keep reaching out and tell that negative voice you're done listening. Have you tried meetings? Counseling? Etc? 
You gain a lot of skills in staying sober by being sober for 7 months.  You haven't lost those skills.
I hope you are able to be easy on yourself. The fact that you are back and trying to get sober is huge. ..Do you have an in person community of sober people? Relapses happen but you are here and that matters a lot...Best of luck in your journey. 
When I drink the hateful and self destructive voices start talking. During times of sobriety the voices are so much more loving forgiving and rational.
