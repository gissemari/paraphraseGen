So earlier this year I decided to do a sober month as part of my new years resolution. I was so excited I told my family and a few of my close friends. It went so great I had everyone's support and constant encouragement. People around me who didn't know saw a physical difference that they could put their finger on but I knew I was just not drinking. I felt fantastic and like I had finally had control over my drinking! But then the month ended. I slowly started falling back into old habits. Making any reason a good reason to drink. So last Sunday my fiance and I had a heart to heart over a margarita no less. He basically said that we have a pattern of getting into fights and having so many issues in our relationship especially when we or I have been drinking.  I of course argued back and didn't want to agree and also like an asshole ordered another drink. Deep down inside I knew he was right. I have a problem with drinking because I am so insatiable and can not stop with just one. My mind body literally craves more. So I am here again. Day 3! Day one was such a piece of cake and I was excited. Day two was pushing it I almost ordered a drink when my fiance went to the restroom assured that I could drink it before he came back. Day 3 I am losing my mind. The novelty has disappeared and the struggle has really begun and it  has me wanting to pull out my hair and rip out my eyeballs. Its literally all I can think about. I know that I want to be a better person. I want to live a life I can be proud of. I don't want to hide and stumble around and have my life pass me by. It's so hard and I am extremely uncomfortable. Temptation is everywhere!  I just wish I could be a normal person. It still amazes me that people go with out drinking at all.. all the time. Simply dumbfounded. I'm struggling for just another day. I'm tired and I'm grumpy and I know a glass of chilled white wine would fix it all. In the back of my mind I know it wouldn't just be one. It would be the whole damn bottle and literally anything else I could get my hands on. And I also realize it would also have me start this cycle all over again.I have seemed to forgotten the time span of this process/ recovery. I know I have a long way to go. Its a struggle. But I am HERE! And today I will not drink. :) Thanks for reading

It's definitely a struggle especially at first. Just hang in there - it will get better!..If your cravings get too crazy maybe try going for a jog! I personally hate jogging but it is one thing I have found that shuts cravings down for me pretty well. Best of luck and keep us posted on your progress!
