I just found this subreddit and it has been great to read the posts and remember where I was at when I started this journey more than three years ago. I never thought I would make it to thirty days much less a year much less three. The longer I'm sober the more I discover about myself and the deeper my happiness becomes. If you're struggling hang in there this is the right path!

Hi u/amydsd!  I'm going to send you an invite to r/dinosaursinrecovery as well it's a sub for those of us with at least one year or sobriety. Glad you found us r/stopdrinking is one of the nicest places on the entire internet (and the Dino sub is a friendly bunch too!)
