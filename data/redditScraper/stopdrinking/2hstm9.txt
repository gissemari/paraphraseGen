At some point  someone who hadmade the decision to soberup ends up lifting a drink and taking it back  and often find themselves in worse trouble than when they started. I'm always looking to hear why. What were your circumstances surrounding your relapse? 
----------immediate responses--------

I never had a good reason and I felt horrible from the second that liquid hit my tongue until I couldn't feel any more. So for those that feel like what they learned here and in AA will make them a well disciplined drinker that you will drink less and know when it's bad.....NOTHING could be farther from the truth. I've market researched this so you don't have to I didn't do it just once I did this no less than 25-30 times over the span of a decade. That's still probably a low number.

Over confidence.  Peer pressure.  Lack of giving a fuck.  It is really easy to not care about much of anything important when having a buzz on so one buzz later and im a drunk again.  My previous relapses were inevitable since I was always waiting to be good enough to drink again.  This time I feel good enough to not drink and I think it will be enough to rationalize not drinking over trying to rationalize having a drink...Moving forward I always have a choice.  I know the consiquences for most of my choices and learning how to deal with that removes a large portion of urges to drink.
Great question! I relapsed more times than I can count between 07 and 10. I spent a lot of time thinking about the why and the how of it. This is what I discovered:..I took the first drink WELL before I actually took the first drink. My mind shifted gears and my old behaviors (lying procrastinating and isolating) came back. It was only a matter of time before I drank again. It is my thinking that brings me out nothing else. So if I keep my head in check I have a better than average chance of not drinking today.
I first said I'd go 30 days no booze I just smoked weed the whole time. Eventually I reached a point where I couldn't get any higher even though my tollerence was increasing with it. I made it 27 days before my dealer ran out and I said fuck it I'm tired of sitting around doing the ale thing so I grabbed a 40oz of rye and blacked out ..Ever since I got desperate and lost everything my resolve has been founded on solid ground. I think the secret to long term sobriety is rock bottom
Relapsed in March this year after nearly 500 days of sobriety because I still had those *romantic* memories of alcohol in my head. It took me another 6 months to get back on track...In my nearly 500 days of sobriety I've learned a lot about myself and also learned to enjoy myself without booze. More importantly I gained a lot of self-respect and perspective became productive again and my life was in general enjoyable (with ups and downs of course)...I wasn't able to enjoy the booze during my relapse. It felt wrong. It felt like I'm cheating on myself because. I knew that I had to stop because I don't want to live this life anymore. So 34 days ago I've stopped again. It's not easy but I'm thankful for every day.
