Complete relapse on Saturday.  My SO has had enough it and I'm just ashamed....I hope she finds the courage in her to stay on...Thank you for reading.   Just got back from an AA meeting

How'd the meeting go?..Also what makes you think you drank this weekend?
If your SO is staying on perhaps direct her to AlAnon.  Alcoholism doesn't just hurt us drunks.  Family and Friends need support too.  ..Welcome back and I'm glad you are going to meetings.  What are you going to do differently?  
I'm glad you made it back to start again.  You can use what you've learned to your benefit.  If you doing mind me asking what did you learn?  Nothing is wasted (no pun intended :0) if it helps you grow.
