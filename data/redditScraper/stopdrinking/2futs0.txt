If you had told me even 25 days ago that I would have an alcohol free 3 weeks ahead I would not have believed you.  I even told a friend recently (before the 3 weeks) who had quit for 100 days that I couldn't stop as I walked towards my bottle shop for that nights fix.....Every single part of my life is better.  There is not one thing that I can think of that is better under an alcoholic stupor.  Over the last 3 weeks I have done the same things I did before but just without alcohol.  I had never played PlayStation games sober since I bought it.  Now I get home and get past the next few levels as a wind down without needing alcohol.  I have managed to go see alcoholic friends at a pub and not drink (if anything seeing how I used to be through them is even more empowering).  Work is so much simpler.  Always being sober and ready to handle any scenario that pops up rather than trying to hide a hangover and hoping nothing bad goes wrong that I need to fix.  Relationship with my wife is much better.  I thought I would be boring and quiet (I tended to be a loud chatterbox when drunk and relatively quiet the day after a binge) but turns out I can be just as lively when sober.  My wife asked me the other morning if I had been sneaking scotch before she woke up as I was my usual talkative self.  So I don't need alcohol to be social with people.  I have more time for hobbies like programming and painting that I had ignored for a long time.....Reading this sub every day is a great therapy and help.  I especially find the honesty from those who relapse a great motivator.  Not ONE of the relapse stories ends with "and so I felt great had a great time and am so happy I am back on the alcohol".

I hope you made some darn good toast to celebrate your 3 full weeks.
