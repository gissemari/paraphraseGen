My 2nd post I've dropped in this sub and again thank you all for your inspiring stories. I relapsed last night and almost lost a friend of mine due to my anger (verbal only). .When I woke I woke with regret as I usually do after drinking..I immediately called my doctor to discuss me getting help and moving forward. .Anyway I hope I can stay on track. I'll be visiting this thread every day! Thank you all for your help and support!

I love immediate action. Not tomorrow or soon. Right now. Well done. 
Welcome back and congrats on your decision.  Excellent job by taking action right now as I easily putting off quitting for years...&gt; Anyway I hope I can stay on track...I learned hope didn't help me to quit - whether I stayed on track or not was entirely up to me..
Hi there welcome back! Congratulations on an immediate return to sobriety and taking action. The next relapse you might just lose your friend and more you never know. So don't let there be another one :)
Back on the wagon good for you!
Thanks all for your input!.I feel better already after 1 day!
