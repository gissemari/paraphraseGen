I'm the one that has now posted for three days on the daily pledge saying this is my day one. But truth is I can't reach day 2. I have gone 22 days and 7 days in the past 4 months but am struggling this time. Any recommendations on getting through that day one?

I have been false starting all week. So as of today I have gotten rid of all the alcohol in the house and handed all my  money/cards over. My car has a full tank of gas so I can get to and from work. I have no means to buy booze. I'm hoping this works. Until i can get in to see a treatment team on the 8th. I am going to ask for antibuse then. Let us know if you find something that works for you.
