The good news is I have finally been sleeping.  That first night I got about 3 hours of sleep the 2nd about 20 lol.  Now I am doing about 7-8 hours a night and going to bed/waking up at the same time.  It feels so good to be more normal in that way...The sorta bad part is what to do with my time.  I got pizza the on the 3rd night and part of that ritual was always stopping by the liquor store.  I didn't do it but it really felt weird.  Yesterday the wife was off and on those days where I didn't have to drive at all I would usually start drinking early and away my day went...Instead I took the kids to see Mockingjay then spent the rest of the day just hanging out with the family.  It felt really good.. but really weird too...I have definitely had cravings but the family has been really supportive about that.  I have been taking my Librium on the dot every 6 hours (if I wake up groggy with my alarm my daughter usually reminds me to take my pill) and today I have pushed that to 8 hours to try to start weaning those down (6 pills left).  ..I purchased my first bass guitar in about 20 years and have been having a lot of fun playing that with Rocksmith.  So if I think hmm I would be drinking now I just fire that up and work through it...The other thing that happened is my appetite came back with a fury.  It's almost like I can't get full so I really have to watch myself.  As a diabetic it's hard to fight the having so much sugar in my system so I have been trying to slowly work that down with no sugar added ice cream and gatorade g2...I have had bouts of depression and anxiety usually starting about an hour before I am supposed to take my pill but they have been manageable...Other than that I am working to get our life back on track.  Getting out of this extended stay hotel is a huge priority but finding a place that will accept an eviction has been a struggle.  I know people have gone from being really irresponsible to overbearing super responsible in these instances so I am trying to just take it a step at a time and not overwhelm myself. ..Finally I can't imagine going through these 5 days without the Libirum and I am a bit anxious on how I will feel when I run out.  I know that PAWS can be a big factor coming up and the wife and I have been trying to be prepared for it.  I should be starting my intensive outpatient program this week (have an appointment tomorrow) so I am hopeful that my recovery will continue.

5 days in; I'd be at an AA meeting maybe 2 meetings.  Get acquainted with what's available.
Hello and welcome. Kudos for six days! Try not to project too much into the future. Stay with the present moment. Intensive outpatient is an excellent plan. I reached out for all the support I could get including treatment a therapist and AA. It worked! Stay in touch.
