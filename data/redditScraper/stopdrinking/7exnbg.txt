*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*. .**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**. .I'm pledging myself to not drinking today and invite you to do the same.. .Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.. .It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours lets not drink alcohol!. .---. .**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!. .What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up.. .**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.. .**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.. .---. .This post goes up at:. .    US - Night/Early Morning  .    Europe - Morning  .    Asia and Australia - Evening/Night..A link to the current Daily Check-In post  can always be found near the top of the sidebar...---..Today is an American holiday.  Holidays can be very stressful.  Feelings of loneliness loss and euphoric recall can cause us to reconsider our sobriety.  I wish to sincerely invite anyone having a difficult time today to use this check-in as a tool to combat the feelings that may cause us to drink again.  If you're struggling feel free to reply as often as you need.  We can get through this - together and sober!  The we is always stronger than the me.

I will not drink with you today. Need to check in because days like these are easier for the brain to let it's guard down and try and validate with "it's a holiday you gotta celebrate!" I've got my sparkling water cranberry raspberry ginger ale and will celebrate without a headache and regrets in the morning. :) Happy Thanksgiving!

Thanks for the holiday tips. Last night I did experience an unexpected wish to enjoy a festive beverage to mark the beginning of the holiday season--a surprise since I've had very little desire to drink since reading Annie Grace. I had some orange spice tea and the little craving passed. ..I will not drink today or tonight. Will pick up some Diet Dr. Pepper at the store this morning for an extra option. 
Count me in :)
I will not drink with you today.
I will not be drinking with you today on this sober strong thanksgiving. My first in years.  Turkey stuffed.and headed for oven .... hitting the gym for quick workout. ..so as I  don't  consider hitting my loony relatibe guests. LOL. Happy Thanksgiving.  We got this. .
Nothing cute to say. Just won't drink today. That's all. 
Gonna kick off my Thanksgiving with 6-8 miles of trail running then enjoy a booze-free day. Lots to be thankful for!..IWNDWYT!
Getting through Thanksgiving surrounded by friends. Here. 
I will not drink today.

I will not drink alcohol with you all today. I will drink apple cider and cranberry juice though!
I'm back at day one after a relapse. It's good to be back. :) One day at a time we got this! 
Happy Thanksgiving to my American friends from Canada. ..I will not drink with you today. 
I will not drink today. Happy sober Thanksgiving!
I love not drinking. Last night used to be an excuse to drink even more. Of course i would feel terrible for thanksgiving with my family and would just keep drinking to kill the hangover. ..I feel great as I sit here drinking my coffee as the fall sun rises. I will not drink today. Thankful for you all.
Day one. I will not drink today! Happy Thanksgiving!!
Hello! IWNDWYT! Happy Thanksgiving everyone.

Thanksgiving! Family is always hard and it's sometimes harder when it's not your own. (And we got a fridge full of beer!) Still though cooking up a good gumbo and I'm happy to be having that. Very grateful for this sub today and for all of you---never thought I could make it this far and am grateful every morning. Not drinking with you all today.
I just found this group and I'm so glad.  Hi everyone!  I will not drink today.  It's only my 3rd day sober.  My husband (drinker) is visiting family so I'm clear to go to sleep as early as I want to eat what I want watch cheesy Penny Dreadful reruns and brave the crowd at the mall tonight with my teenagers.  Yay!  I can do this without pressure. It's the peer pressure I'm worried about.
I will not drink today
I will not drink with you all today! 
Hey SD: I will not drink with you today!
I will not drink today!
I will not drink today no matter what.  Why ruin Thanksgiving and probably the following days/weeks/months by picking up a drink?  Nope not going to do that. 
I will not drink today! I will be calm &amp; happy with both our adult sons &amp; our grandchild. I will make the best deviled eggs anyone has ever had! Happy Thanksgiving to my SD Family!
Not drinking with you all today. Woke up super early this morning feeling so great. Ready for a run and day of cooking/eating with my SO. Happy Turkey day.
Not today not today not today!!..Happy Thanksgiving to all you lovely folks across the pond!..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
I will not drink with you today.  ..Happy Thanksgiving. ..Let's give thanks for not getting in drunken arguments and not having a hangover tomorrow

Happy Thanksgiving!!! Going to start cooking my ass of soon SOBER!.I'm thankful that I have a great kitchen to cook in a beautiful family (and friends) to cook for and the resolve to stay sober with all of you today!!!
Here to make my pledge - IWNDWYT!..Holy crap I say that with extra pride. Last night was the closest I came to snapping since my commitment to sobriety...My family is visiting from out of town and my mother has been drinking a lot for a long time. Usually when she visits she brings a box of wine and a case or so of beer. I told her that I wasn't drinking and asked her to not bring much; she said that she wouldn't bring any...Last night though when we went to get dinner. We went to a local place that I've had many a beer and has a variety of microbrews.  Additionally my wife was already at her parents' (where we are all going today) - and she's the only one that I'm accountable to other than myself. So I could've easily "gotten away with it."..Of course I was thinking about it the whole way there. I was vacillating between not drinking and having a couple pints and bringing a six-pack home. I should've made the commitment prior to even getting there but there I was at the table with the menu in hand debating whether I should order a beer.... but I didn't even look at the beer list and simply ordered a water. Crisis averted!..So here I am a proud puppy - not drinking with you through this holiday!..
I will not drink today. 
Thankful for this supportive community. Holidays have sometimes been a relapse trap for me but not this year. I will not drink today.
Saying NO in NOvember. I will not drink with you guys today

Family (trigger) plus feelings of anxiety/self-loathing (trigger) -- but this isn't worth drinking over and drinking will just make everything so much worse. I will NOT drink with you today.
I will no drink today. Thankful for sobriety mindful it's an ongoing battle.
I will not drink today! 
I will not drink today. 
Spending the night with my mother in law...She has a cabinet full of booze and often makes me want to drink all of it...But I'm going to avoid her and spend as much time as I can with my kids. ...I will not drink with you today. 
Thankful to not drink today.
I will not drink today!
I'm not a huge fan of getting together with my family on holidays since I'm the only one not drinking but I will not drink today. Thinking about bringing one of the books I'm reading but don't want to seem antisocial.

I don't drink and I won't drink today. I'm so grateful for all the wonderful ways life has surprised and inspired me since getting sober. ..I'm also looking forward to spending time with family today. ..Good luck to you all today. I was in a meeting this week and someone said  it's just a Thursday  which is a great reminder that we do this sober thing one day at a time and Thanksgiving is still only 24 hours long. ..I'm thankful for SD today!!
I will not drink today.

I will not drink today. My entire extended family gets together for thanksgiving and there is massive amounts of booze. But this will be my 3rd sober thanksgiving and everyone seems to have caught on that I am sober. Nobody has offered me drinks but still hard to be around so much booze. Happy Sober Turkey Day!

Not hungover so it is time to create a wonderful food baby. Will reveal the gender later

Not drinking today! Happy Thanksgiving

Checkin in - still in the hunt for my first 30 days in years! 
Happy Thanksgiving y'all! I am thankful for so so much and I will not drink with you today. 
First sober Thanksgiving since 2005! Spending the day with my family at my grandfathers house. Found suppositories from 1997 in the fridge door. They were my grandmothers who died 7 years ago.  I will not drink today but I will giggle like a child at all the oddities I find today.
I'm thankful for all of you and this community. IWNDWYT.
94 days sober and thankful!!!
I will not drink with you today. 
I will not drink today.
Happy Turkey Day Everyone! IWNDWYT
Had a drunk dream last night. Woke up soooo relieved I didn't ruin my streak. Stocked up on La Croix and Fever Tree ginger beer for the family visit. Happy Thanksgiving! I will not drink with you today!
Happy thanksgiving everyone. Thankfully I will not be drinking with you all today. 
I will not drink today 
Happy Thanksgiving to all the Americans out there! I will not drink with you today. 
I won't be drinking today.  Happy Thanksgiving to all of us Americans.
I will not drink with you today. Promise. 
No matter what happens today good or bad I will not drink any alcohol for the next 24 hours.
Be strong sober suckers! The drunk douchebags will be at the door. Think about how you feel and what you have accomplished. Even restarting again. My worst thanksgiving was fighting with my now dead dad that I love so much because I drank before showing up Thanksgiving and my mom started her shit w me.  He always wanted a sober Thanksgiving. This ones for him. My mom can suck it. She is a very negative trigger. Internet too small for that bullshit story. Prove everyone wrong today. Stay sober. Listen. Have fun. 
I WILL NOT DRINK TODAY!!!!!!!
I went out last night and stayed completely sober and might I add very tired. Got to drive my drunk cousin home so she was safe...Funny thought; when people find out I'm not drinking they think pregnancy. NO WAY JOSE! just trying to live my best life. Lol..IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you today.
Been sober for 4 days after nearly 5 years of daily drinking so I'm trying to keep the streak going. I always use a holiday as an excuse to drink my brains out but not today. 
I work as a nurse assistant my last day at my facility is today and one of my charge nurses (and friends) nearly made me cry yesterday. She hand embroidered a towel in my favorite color with the serenity prayer as a going away present. I'm thankful for the wonderful people I've encountered even when life is hard. I will not drink today.
IWNDWYT 
This is the 1 year anniversary of when I flung myself off the wagon last time. It will not happen again today.
checking in!.
Today is a good day to be sober. 
This is going to be a hard one lot of family who are heavy drinkers going to a location that's full of stress wife already on edge..  But I'm not going to drink today.  It's been 9 days each day gets a little better and I know if I can make it through today I can make it through most anything.
Happy Thanksgiving everyone! It'll be my first sober holiday and this is definitely a bit one. ..But I will not drink with all of you today. Enjoy the food and actually remember it! 
I won't drink today. 
Happy Thanksgiving!  Let me tell you it has gotten easier as the days go on and not drinking becomes a part of "who I am am." The routine of it has become powerful in itself and acts as a rock to keep me stable.  Keep up the good fight friends it is worth it!  I won't be drinking with you today.
Annoyed that family has been calling me  lame  and asking  what's wrong with you?  when I turn drinks down  but thankful for my resolve! IWNDWYT. Happy Thanksgiving all.  
I will not drink today. 
I will not drink today. Happy Thanksgiving SD!
Today I am thankful for my sobriety. My yoga practice. My cat. My boyfriend. My family. The whole of my life experiences good and bad. Shoes on my feet and a place to sleep at night. Money in my savings account. The ability of my lungs to inhale and exhale each sip of air. The ability of my tear ducts to cry. The ability of the corners of my mouth to smile. The overall amazing wonder that is my body and all that it can do. Forks. Cheese. Stuffing. Potatoes. Happy Thanksgiving SD. I am thankful not to be drinking with you today.
I will not drink with you today and I am very thankful for that.
I will not drink with you today.

Birthday dinner at a brewery last night...so much pressure as I haven't gone public yet. I prevailed! Came home read some Artemis and passed out at 11 and woke up feeling great at 6 AM. Just made a trifle and enjoying the holiday! Happy Indigenous Day all! I will not drink with you today!   
I will not drink today. Did you watch the Macy's parade? I was one of the balloon handlers for Charlie Brown. It was a fantastic experience!
I will not drink with you today!!! :)
Today I will not drink.  Enjoy your Thanksgiving today if you're American.  Fortunately drinking on a holiday was never my MO so staying sober today won't be a problem.
No drinking today or the next 24 hours!
I will not drink today. Thanks everyone and Happy Thanksgiving to all!
I'm not drinking today!
Not gonna drink today. But I will pass out in a food coma. ..Twice. 
Happy Thanksgiving to all who celebrate it!  I will not drink today. 
Nope de dope de dope! (insert muppet sounds here). Not drinking today. Thanks SD for always being there!.
Happy Thanksgiving.  Thankful to not be drinking with you today!
Not drinking today!
I haven't drank for 11yrs. I have seen many people use the Holidays and other family related events as an excuse to go drink again. Everything from "too much pressure to drink with family/friends" to "I'm so depressed that I have to drink to escape the pain". These are excuses. There are no reasons to go back to drinking if one really doesn't want to.there is always someone to talk to about it. There is always someone who cares about you. Leave yourself a way out of family or friend get togethers. Park on the street. Drive yourself even if your spouse or SO is going if they don't really understand your desire to stay sober yet. Keep your phone charged and on you. Tell someone that you can trust outside of the get together what your plans are and ask if they would be available to talk if you're feeling overwhelmed. Be grateful if you woke up this morning sober and hold on to that feeling so that you can repeate it tomorrow. Happy Thanksgiving everyone. 
I will not drink today!
I will not drink today! 
Happy Thanksgiving everyone! I won't drink with you today.

So begins the first sober holiday season in six years!.IWNDWYT
I will not drink today!
Feeling isolated among family and friends. My first sober holiday is proving to be tough but I will not drink with you today! 
IWNDWYT
I will not drink today. Thanks.
The day's almost through but checking in anyway.  
I will not drink with you today.
IWNDWYT! Amidst the family get togethers...drinking is the last thing I need.
I will not drink today.
Drinking lots and lots of tea today at the in-laws. 
Still not drinking and I won't be drinking today either. I consciously avoided going to Thanksgiving with my family because I knew the stress would get to me and possibly lead to relapse. Now I'm getting the guilt trip from a few different people but I can't really expect them to understand my reasons. I'll be ten days sober tonight. Brain and body both feel like they're still resetting from all the shit I put them through the past three years. I won't drink with y'all today. 
I didn't drink today.  ..Day 41 of detox. First Thanksgiving (in a long time) that I didn't show up nursing a hangover at 12:30pm. Felt so good.   ..Dealt with the dysfunctional family but they couldn't trigger me. . Zero desire for alcohol.
Here's to a sober thanksgiving. I  will not drink today. 
I will not drink today.
Yay still here still hanging in there!.Matti
proud sobernaut flying forward to reach new heights in reality!!!!!!!!!!! 
Hello - I've had a decent day. I've worked well eaten well done some good exercise in the evening. Soon I'm going to meditate for a bit and go to sleep not to late. Hopefully another good day tomorrow :) 
Tough one today. I've been strangely fighting a relapse for the past month but I won't drink with you today. 
First sober Thanksgiving in many years.
Very late today but I will not drink this evening. 
I will not drink today. 
Holy shit I got my 4

Not drinking with y'all!
Today I am enjoying life and doing home project with my daughter. 26 days sober and just feeling awesome.
