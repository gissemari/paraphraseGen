I'm 3 ginger ales deep at my fantasy football draft lol. I've  been sober for two months now and it feels great. I'm struggling right now though because I want to be back with my ex who left me because of drinking. I'm in love with her and it hurts...All my friends are wasted and this would be a great time to drink to forget about everything going on. BUT I'm looking forward to going for a run later tonight and waking up feeling great tomorrow. Just wanted to say being sober sucks sometimes but it always feels better tomorrow.

Stay strong. There's not much of a harder place to stop drinking than in a building devoted to selling it! Have a 4th ginger ale for me!

Way to know better. No matter what tomorrow will come so make it great. Good job. 
The likelihood that you will text your ex is greatly reduced by your consumption of ginger ale instead of beer. ..Slam back some more ginger ales! 
Hugs!  IWNDWYT 
You can do it. YOU CAN DO IT!  Think of how good you will feel after that run later. IWNDWYT!
Kudos for two months! ..Being around drunk people was something I avoided at all cost. 
Not drinking is my only way to avoid texting my ex... I couldn't help but text her after two pints.
