Posting from a throwaway account. Ive been lurking for a few years and have posted on here with my main account quite a few times. I stopped drinking last summer and made it about 5 months before relapsing. "I'll just drink once a month" immediately turned into "Once a week is fine" and before you could blink I was drinking 5 or 6 days a week. Im going to give this another try currently about two weeks sober. ..Ive notice that for a lot of people the comment on how their relationship with their spouse improves when they get off the bottle. And for me the experience has been quite the opposite. When Im drinking I find myself more affectionate towards my wife. Sober its the opposite. Its like all I can see are little flaws and annoyances. "She's gained weight". "Her face is broken out." Just lots of little things. ..I remember this was a problem last time I quit our bedroom life pretty much stopped on my account. I know there isn't an easy answer but I'm frustrated and obviously this isn't something I can just talk to her about. Thoughts?

putting down the bottle is just the start.  in order to get any type of contented sobriety i had to do a lot of work in order to change my thinking.  i stopped growing emotionally right around the time i started drinking.  i drank for 20 years which means i didn't really grow.  recovery is a slow process but it's well worth the effort.  the 12 steps of alcoholics anonymous helped me not only quit drinking but recover.
I have found a similar thing with regards to my sobriety and SO. A big part of how much I was drinking when I quit I believe was due to drinking to smooth over issues I have with her. We've talked about it but she doesn't like talking about this for obvious reasons. I really don't think the relationship is going to make it as long as I'm sober because we're very different. I could go into examples but it doesn't matter. Our bedroom life has stopped too not because she's not attractive but because of all the issues I have with her that she doesn't seem to want to resolve. Them's my thoughts it's tough and frustrating to deal with but I'm trying.
