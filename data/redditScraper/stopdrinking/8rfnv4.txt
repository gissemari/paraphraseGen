During the week I look forward to the end of the day as much as I dread it. It's like the second I am done... I am both fighting the urge to drink and also **waiting** to give into it. ..Like in Donnie Darko when the path comes out of his chest I have this never ending picture of my path leading me directly to the beer in my fridge or the cocktail out on a nice breezy relaxing terrace (I love you summer but also fuck you summer). The lie of bliss is so magnetic. .."I'll just have one" "I'll have a water in between every drink" "I'm not going to drink that much". ..Thank goodness when someone hands me a drink they just bought for me because I can't say no to free alcohol!!! Thanks for saving me from the crunchy itchy feeling of sobriety and consciousness. ..**Test one:** Good-bye drinks for a co-worker. I pre-occupied myself with conversation. I could only stay for 30 minutes so it was more like a mini-test anyway. Whew...**Test two on deck**: Ugghhh this one I'm struggling with. Really good friend's birthday party drinks at a bar. ALL my friends will be there. BUT literally right now as I'm typing this out... I am realizing a few things in my favor...1) It's at a gay  bar which means there will be LOTS of dancing and good music. I like that and I can do that...2) It's at a gay bar which means that as a female I'll probably have trouble getting drinks anyway. I can do this. Can I do this???? UGHHHH..3) I WANT to do things tomorrow morning. Gym clean generally function you know...I can do this. I can do this. I can do this. Because I'm going to check back later soberly  hopefully happy and with my wallet phone and memory all in my possession.

You've got this and IWNDWYT!
One: Donnie Darko is one of my favorite movies. Two: You've got this. Have a blast stay sober and tell us how awesome it was in the morning. :)
Play the tape forward because u have lots to do tomorrow. That's what I am doing.  
You can do this.... and when you look back later at having done it the feelings that you can feel then will be wonderful. Stay strong. IWNDWYT 
Just go and time yourself for the first 30 minutes. Get a mixed non-alcoholic drink. I can guarantee after 30 mins of being there around everyone else you'll realize you were already having a ton of fun and the drinking idea just kind of fades away into the background. Besides I don't know you but I can guarantee you're way more interesting and fun when you're sober. We all are!
