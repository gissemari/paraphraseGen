Friday night my husband BIL and stepson went to NXT Live. We had seats RIGHT next to where the wrestlers walk out FRONT ROW.  ..My husband and BIL both drank and I won't lie I was struggling. At 67 days sober this was a challenge to not have a beer or drink as there was bourbon (my drink of choice) and tequila...At the start of the main event I hear my BIL scream 'WHAT THE F*UCK?!' and take off running. Then I smell it...the tequila and vomit smell making its way through the air. Dude a few seats over from me was so drunk he threw up all over the floor BIL and even part of the wrestling mats and was promptly escorted out...Needless to say my craving for a drink passed swiftly and quickly. SO glad I toughed it out but if that's not a sign there is such a thing as fate or some kind of power higher power helping me fight this fight I don't know what is.

He puketh so thou may proceed fruitfully on thine sober journey. ..Totz your Higher Power! Nothing like watching the willing suffering of others to see how crazy that lifestyle is.
