I quit drinking and I feel amazing. I struggled with my drinking for over 4 years drinking about a 1-2 pints of rum or vodka a day drinking from the time I woke up to the time I fell asleep. ..I can't believe how well this is going. I tapered off for the last month or so down to about 1/2 pint a day and then cut it cold turkey. I felt fine physically besides the occasional light headedness. I have been feeling so happy lately I get so euphoric and feel so great it's like I'm physically and mentally high on life but then I suddenly drop and get anxious and light headed and a bit shaky. Has anyone else experienced this? Should I be worried or will this go away? I am a healthy (besides unknown drinking damage) 24 yo female. I don't feel like I'm going to faint or anything but it's enough for me to notice myself feeling... off. ..Any advice is much appreciated. Thanks!

Congrats!  The best advice when anyone is quitting drinking is to see your doctor and honestly advise him/her of your history and desire to stop.  There is no negative or risks to doing this.  It is the safest thing...Now with that being said you sound like you are off to a great start and I would bet that your negative symptoms will quickly improve.  However please be aware that your euphoric feelings will also likely go away.  People often describe it as a Pink Cloud.  You should be aware that life goes on while you are in sobriety.  Therefore you will still have feelings of sadness anxiety depression and other negative feelings from time to time.  Don't be afraid of these feelings.  Often these are the feelings we run from when we drink.  Now you can learn to accept and deal with them in a healthy productive manner.  One you can rely upon for the rest of your (hopefully) long and happy life....Good luck to you!!  Again congrats.
I've described almost precisely the same sensation on=f euphoria that you're describing in your post /u/seer_of_things.  What I think happened to me (and possibly you) is that our bodies and nervous systems were under daily assault from this depressant (alcohol) for a good long while.  We underestimate the overall impact that this has on our bodies and minds believing incorrectly that we're past it a day or two following a drunk.  The reality is that it takes some time to deal with this--and our nervous system manifest this by making us feel incredibly anxious in very early sobriety.  Here's what I can tell you happened to me.  I got better over a few weeks and before I knew it I was on what is called a pink cloud.  ..This is why the best advice is to get proper medical attention; and get to some recovery meetings (AA group an IOP or SMART Recovery) where people just like us have been through all of this and can help you locate accessible resources.  ..Good luck and I sincerely hope you keep sharing on /r/stopdrinking as you go along.
