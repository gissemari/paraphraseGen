Congrats on being back on the horse...Best advice is to get to a doctor if you can alcohol withdrawl is nothing to mess with.
Every withdrawal can be worse than the last thanks to kindling. ..Glad you're here!
If you're worried about DTs after an eight day stint it certainly isnt likely.  But if you had the kind of withdrawal symptoms that needed medical attention last time you got sober then it's probably a good idea to see a physician.  
I have got withdrawals from less time but I drank the entire bottle every day during that time and hardly ate. Getting back to eating/drinking water normally is huge. Don't be afraid to see a doctor!
We have strict rule against seeking medical advice on this site because no one here is qualified to give it. Withdrawal can be dangerous even deadly and should be supervised by a doctor. We have removed your post and hope you'll seek medical support.
