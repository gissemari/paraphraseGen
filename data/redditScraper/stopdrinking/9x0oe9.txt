If you're struggling at all I highly recommend this. It's best if you have headphones but it's an incredible experience. The audio quality is unparalleled and you feel enveloped in what you're listening to. It was so easy to find your center. ..Did this for fifteen minutes last night and felt entirely at peace. It's a great form of stress relief too...You can find tracks on Youtube!
