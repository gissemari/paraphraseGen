My brother started getting into trouble as a result of drinking a couple of years ago. His actions got progressively worse (crashing cars --> lying and stealing from my parents and grandma to get money for alcohol --> getting kicked out of school) until my parents decided it was out of their control. He struggles with anxiety depression bulimia alcoholism. He also smokes pot.  On Wednesday and Thursday of last week we took him to an intervention and then checked him into Cirque Lodge in Utah. He's there now...The interventionist told us to focus on improving family communications (using "I" statements) and understanding alcoholism in order to improve his support structure within our family and thus decrease his chances of a relapse on return from Utah. I will absolutely do anything I can to help him but am just not sure where to start. Does anyone have experience with this that can help?

Check out [AlAnon](http://www.al-anon.alateen.org/) a group for family members of alcoholics. There's a subreddit for it as well /r/AlAnon 
There is a seperate subredit for family of alcoholics - [/r/alanon](http://www.reddit.com/r/alanon)..Alanon Familiy Group is a support fellowship for familiy members of alcoholics. They'll be full of advice. ..They have real life meetings also see:-..www.al-anon.alateen.org/how-to-find-a-meeting..Good luck
of course there is /r/alanon but be supportive is the best thing you can do at this point.
What you have to do now is 'nothing'.  You can not fix your brother.  /r/alanon Good  Luck
alcoholics can not be 'helped' they can only help themselves. It can be frustrating for the people who love them and are willing to do anything for them because there is no magical 'thing' you can do to make it all go away...It can be heartbreaking to feel so helpless and angry with and for a person you love who you want to be better...rogermelly1 was right the only thing you can do is gain the skills to cope with this situation and you may find that over at the alanon subreddit...All you CAN do is keep being loving and supportive...This coming from an alcoholic who loves another alcoholic.
Yeh there's not a great deal you can do. Magazine's  chatting make sure he doesn't get bored (people I've known get sober and go back usually do because they're "bored"). Have you thought of going on vacation or something when he gets out? Take him out of the old environment for a while?
