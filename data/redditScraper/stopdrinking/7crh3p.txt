I don't even know what to say. I've been hungover and sleeping all day. I can't remember the last night I didn't drink. Maybe two weeks ago. And I've been binging every night. I can't remember anything. Where is my sanity? I want it back. I want to stop drinking but drinking related things always pop up. I'm supposed to be going to a concert with coworkers on Friday and I know they're all going to drink. I feel like they'll think it's weird if I don't drink. I always drink. I don't even know if I could participate in going to a concert right now without drinking. But I want to stop. Maybe not forever. Maybe I'm in slight denial about the severity of my problem. This is such a struggle. I'm not ready to publicly admit I have a problem. But I'm not going to drink tonight so that's a start.

I observed "dry people dry places" in the early going...Have a plan?
I was extremely nervous going to my first AA meeting. When I introduced myself and said "I'm Papi_Queso and I'm an alcoholic" it was incredibly liberating. I had never said those words out loud. Coming to terms with your disease is the first big step. We're here for you.
