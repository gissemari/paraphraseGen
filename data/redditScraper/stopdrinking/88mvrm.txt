It hasn't been the easiest journey but I've been going strong the past 50+ days. My partner quit drinking with me mostly to support me but also because he's the kind of person who could take it or leave it anyway (how this is possible I have *no* idea)...But now the weather is nice I've been home alone for nearly a week and my mouth is literally watering at the thought of walking down the street to grab a pint...And I keep thinking... everyone relapses I deserve one relapse! Don't I!?..How f'ed up is that? :(

You deserve way better than that!
fuck no! Relapse does not have to be a part of recovery. At All. So now its about how do you use your tools to get past the urge. Can you think of some things you can do sober right now to pass some time? 
F'ed up to the max if you was askin me. I still have my original desire chip and I have no regrets. 
I sometimes get in that holding pattern and I arrive at that I deserve NOT to relapse and these are the reasons...
Your brain has worked hard for the past 50 days to replenish valuable neurotransmitters that were depleted from years of alcohol abuse. A single relapse can reset your brain back to DAY 1. Would a few hours of drinking be worth that? Plus there's [the Kindling Effect](https://www.recoveryfirst.org/blog/the-kindling-effect-of-addiction/). No thank you.
Play the tape forward. How would you like to feel tomorrow morning? You're doing so great. You can do it.
I can relate - the weather is a bit of a trigger for me as well. It's easy to romanticize/fantasize about "just once" but that's exactly what it is a fantasy. Don't let the little gremlin trick you. You got this!
ahhhh is in the same boat !! BUT I will not drink with you today :)
It probably would not be just one..One relapse alone could be 4 months of near daily drinking.
Alcoholic brain is fing devious! Great job I won't relapse with you today.
