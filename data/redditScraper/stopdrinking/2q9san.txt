Good morning /sd!..And on this special holiday edition of WuW it's important that we listen to [the message the Wise Men brought to the manger](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bD_HaXHCk04/Uro5nbb7B6I/AAAAAAAAATk/Md-PAhtcY28/s1600/IMG_20131224_170336.jpg). ..Here it is folks - Christmas Eve! Please share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations below...**Triumph**: I made it through the family holiday! We did ours a little earlier this year and I had a wonderful time with family and friends and got some great presents. My grandmother kind of slyly asked me if I was "still not drinking...?" and it was awesome to look her right in the eyeballs and say "Yup and it's really working out for me." :)..**Struggle**: I'm gonna let this one go right on by me today. I feel like I'd have to dig deep for a struggle this morning and that just doesn't feel in tune with the season. Oh wait - it's raining! Yeah that sucks. :)..**General Chat**: Do you guys have any Christmas Eve traditions? Ours were pretty normal: everyone gets to open one present and then we put gold star stickers on our fingers dip them in ultraviolet light paint and write our wishlists to Santa on inside walls of the chimney just in case. (Um kidding on that last part.)..What's going on with you guys?

**Triumph**: I'm still sober! Thanks to the advice of u/comprimisedaccount I have made myself a reminder bracelet which I will wear daily to remind me of all the amazing things sobriety has given me..**Struggle**: I have to finish off the damn Christmas shopping town will be rammed! I used to cope with going to the pub before and afterwards. Going with my housemate so we'll still do that but I'll have a nice pint of iced tea and yes I will eat chocolate damnit!..**General Chat**: My Christmas Eve tradition is to cook a meal served traditionally in another country at Christmas with my housemate. I have some special limited edition 'party' Shloer for the occasion! Last year was Poland and this year is India!
'Love the Creche!  BTW /u/cake_or_radish -- you have been doing an awesome job with this weekly post.  
Triumph: so this is really huge for me. I have OCD recovering from an eating disorder PTSD and some major depressive disorder thrown in. I have a REALLY hard time being away from my house in Ohio. It is my safe zone where I rarely feel the fight or flight so I spend a lot of time at home. I am in NY for a few weeks to visit my family whom I haven't seen in over a year. ..I was so freaking scared. I will be away from my comfort zone. Eight freaking hours away. ..So far I have done more in the past few days than I have in months. Normally I go out of the house to go to the gym and the doctors. That is really all. Maybe if I am having a good day I might take a walk with my fianc . ..Just yesterday I went to the gym out for lunch went to the science museum went thrift shopping watched a movie and went to the store! ..I think I was so far out of my comfort zone I was just like screw it. Let's do all the activities!..Struggle: I had to spend 8 hours in the car. I do not do car rides well. Forgot to mention I have ADHD. Sitting still is not something I do pretty much ever. ..Also when we stopped for lunch I let my kitten Omar out on his harness so he could get some food and water. That little piece of fluffy crap slipped out of his harness and ran under the car. I was on my hands and knees in muddy water trying to get him out. Luckily my fianc  was able to grab him but got very dirty in the process. Omar did not get any other stops until we got to my mom's house. I still would be frustrated with him if he wasn't so cute and my little furry shadow that follows me everywhere. ..Christmas Eve doesn't really come with traditions anymore. We used to host this HUGE dinner for 50+ people. We would go to church and watch a play then come home and my dad would get to cooking. He would also make over 25 types of cookies and about 100 of each type. So our house would be covered head to toe in cookies warmth and laughter. ..Sadly my dad died in January 2007 after a very short battle with cancer. And with that the Christmas Eve dinners have slowly gotten smaller and smaller to now just my mom grandma mom's boyfriend and me. 
Yeaaaaaaaaah wise men!!
**Triumph** - its rain not snow!!! (would be a shit ton if it were)..**Struggle** - not too much really avoiding encircling drama fairly well...**Chat** - taking bets on whether the Correction Officers let us wear Santa Hats into the AA meeting in prison tonight.  Guys with seniority who know us probably not working so its anyone's guess. 
Me reading this post: "Is ... today ... Wednesday?" I've been working from home this week I have no clue...**Triumph**: This is more of a Mission Possible Monday but whatever. My partner and I spent all weekend making a music video and recording of the great Mariah Carey classic "All I Want for Christmas is You." The final recording includes us playing ukulele acoustic guitar electric guitar xylophone flute piano bells wood block and a shaker. It is completely ridiculous and absolutely the kind of thing we'd never do when I was drinking. I used to start a weekend day with a whole bottle of white wine before she woke up and then let my mood and energy roll downhill from there. (Side note: in general since I stopped drinking I've experienced a huge uptick in silliness in my life. Really would have thought it'd be the other way around!)..**Struggle**: I have to initiate a somewhat-confrontational conversation with my dad today and I'd really rather just ignore the issue. I used to always have at least two glasses of wine before ever getting on the phone with him and my stepmother. I don't talk to them all that often so the experience of sober conversation and hanging up the phone and *not* pouring another drink is still kinda new...**General chat**: My family doesn't have any particular Christmas Eve stuff. I think when I was a kid we went to Midnight Mass mostly to get it over with. I'm going to see the stage musical of "Newsies" this afternoon which I hope will be a tradition for years to come. ..Stay safe and sober everyone. Merry Eve!
**Triumph**: I'm continuing to play good tennis.  I had a great match on Monday night against some of my new competition now that I've been bumped up a level.  I was nervous and started off pretty flat.  But I was able to calm myself and ended up kicking his butt.  It felt really good to see that my rating pretty accurately reflects my level of play.  I know I wouldn't be here if I were still drinking...**Struggle**: Just found out my new puppy has a torn ACL.  It's going to be a rough 3-4 months. :/  But I know drinking wouldn't solve anything.  And I know dealing with her and my wife through this would be so much tougher if I were not myself -- 100%...**General Chat**: Ho Ho Ho!..**Edit**: For some reason my Enter key submitted my comment instead of giving me a new line.  I had to start pasting a newline from another application to finish my comment.  Whatever.
**Triumph:** I was called on the carpet last week and given a thorough and thoroughly deserved dressing down. Aspects of my work have suffered this fall affected by my depression and other personal matters. It's a triumph because I did not have an urge to drink afterwards...**Struggle:** Nope going well this week...**Chat:** We do the one-present thing too. I might steal the ultraviolet light and Mouse's decorate the hall ideas.
**Triumph:** As I posted earlier I went to my first AA meeting. So far that has been the best part of my holiday...**Struggle:** Tonight I am going to a Christmas Eve party that I know will have a ton of alcohol. It's a family event and I have been going to this house every Christmas Eve for as long as I can remember. For the last several years I have indulged and have even needed to spend the night. It sucks not waking up in your own bed on Christmas day...**General Chat:** I am so excited we just had the winter solstice. Every day from this point on until the summer solstice is getting longer. I hate winter. 
Triumph: I told my mom dad and sister that I had stopped drinking. They're the first people I've told IRL so this was huge for me. ..Struggle: Family is amazing but staying with them for 5 days can be frustrating at times...General chat: Just finished the last Divergent book Allegiant. It really was not good at all. Read the first one and then stop.
