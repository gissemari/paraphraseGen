i'm watching some tv shows to pass the time and get distracted but i bought a pepsi and my only thought is to buy some rum and mix it up. That really made me ansious and i don't know if i'm going to make it..I guess i'm really fucked. i guess i have no way out. After every realpse even harder to stay sober. .I just have to make it work maybe i will relapse but i have to be okay.

you just have to get through each day as it comes. be aware of how you feel but don't let it control you. Look at the reasons why you drink not just the urge to do so. 
I found day 3 hard as well but got through it.  I  believe in you.  
Day 3 is always toughest for me.  Try to hold out and go moment to moment.  Friday night is hard on me to but Saturday morning is so much better sober.  Maybe trying some breathing techniques to relax http://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=youtube+breathing+exercises+for+anxiety&amp;view=detail&amp;mid=D14B6137841B621E3E2CD14B6137841B621E3E2C&amp;FORM=VIRE
The early days are often the hardest. I did my best just to get through cravings by treating myself to a bath good book tea and early bedtime. Boring I know but my brain didn't re-wire itself overnight. Do you have any sober people you can call? That always helps me too.
I absolutely promise that it does get incrementally easier with every day you don't raise that glass to your lips.  The first week was hell for me the first month hard the second month I was starting to get used to my new non-drinking self.  Now I don't desire a drink unless I'm wicked stressed - old coping mechanism.  I can be around other people drinking responsibly but wouldn't want to hang out with folks getting their drunk on.....But I still come here every day as a reminder of the hold that ETOH can have on our lives.  I know I must never forget that.
Hang in there! You don't have to give in to your thoughts.  Keep posting here or head into the IRC chat. There is always people there to help you through this. 
i'm only on day two and my urges are also insane - the INSANITY is knowing my brain has already forgotten how shitty i felt and looked after my last bender. .the only thing keeping me going really is that my anxiety was so much less today and i found i could actually respond to people when they spoke to me rather than getting all flushed and weird and ducking away. .the anxiety that i get after a night of drinking (or five six 12 nights in a row) is debilitating. .stick with it!  .we're fighting a freaking LIQUID i mean cmon we have to be able to beat a liquid?!!!..i'm totally NOT drinking with you today.
