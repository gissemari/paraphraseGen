I've made the decision to stop drinking again. I was sober 8 months (quit cold turkey on my own which was so hard) and then in August 2018 I relapsed after a brutal marriage separation. .I've been drinking since August but in the last month it's gotten to a point I am just binging nearly every time I drink. .I'm afraid I won't be able to stop the cravings and the withdrawals will be too much. I am going to a withdrawal clinic today for some help but I'm looking for personal experiences / suggestions. ANYTHING that's helped you get clean and stay sober. Including any withdrawal medications that have worked. I did it totally alone the first time so I just don't think I was ready. Im going to take all the help and advice I can get to push through the hell to recovery

For the early days I lock away my cash and cards for a period of time to get through the urges I can't control.
What made my attempt at sobriety successful was getting help starting with a therapist. I saw a doctor went to rehab outpatient treatment and got involved in AA. I was desperate and willing to do whatever it took to get well. ..Going it alone was never successful because I had no clue how to build a sober happy life on my own. Sobriety is eaiser and more fun with help.
