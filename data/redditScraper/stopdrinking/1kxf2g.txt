One year ago i subscribed to /r/stopdrinking and started my closed 31 days rehab therapy...Im in the individual alcohol therapy since and Gambling group therapy....I was havy drinker for over 10 years with last 3 years of constant drinking without any day of pause. over 1 liter of strong alcohol (usually whiskey) and over 5 liters of beer - on daily basis...Living hell....Some time ago i was unable to answer phone because of panic attacks. No to mention talking with people. .Because of anxiety i was passing out in shop lines and public transportation...Now im working on my own (and my business partner's) company with great perpectives im organizing startup events and starting to implement my own ideas to the market because i've found investor...Im so happy but i've had my ups and downs...The most important things i'm working on:..* stopped thinking black and white - there's never just Euphoric awesome or Miserably sad. (that's how one of 3 addiction mechanisms works)..* thinking before feeling - alcohol made me feel emotions disproportionately strong to the situation. Just a few moments of analizing situation can bring that "imaginery" emotion down....im struggling with workaholic problems at the moment but it's great that **when you take a good care of your therapy it's working for every addiction.**..I was living in constant fear day night waking up eating sitting.....After a year my life motto is: ..**Call it a day pleased wake up curious.**.....without any fear and feeling of accomplishment....Thank you guys for being with me here on my most important moments!.Best of luck for all of you!..Best of luck for new ones! .-it's getting better..all the time better just let yourself feel awful few times ;)....

That's great news and a great motto too.  Congrats!
Wooty woot. That's quite heroic. ..The beast has many faces and its a huge encouragement to hear your winning on all fronts. ..
Congrats!
I love the motto!  Sounds like you've really turned things around and are on strong footing.  Thanks for sharing.
Congrats! Awesome motto.
Good for you.  I experienced the living hell as well.  Glad to be rid of it for now.  Well done on walking free.
you mentioned 3 addiction mechanisms can you expand on that?  I have never heard that term you mentioned 1 what are the other 2?..Also well done!!

Congrats! And I totally agree that "when you take good care of your therapy it's working for every addiction"--working through some of my issues with alcohol has also helped with some of my issues with food.
Congratulations on such a big milestone!
Good for you!
Well done! 
Congrats on 365 days!  I literally smiled when I saw your post and your smiley star.  :)..&gt; After a year my life motto is:.Call it a day pleased wake up curious...This is the hugest thing for me.  Waking up EVERY MORNING sober in my own head without that rushing fear of 'Where am I? How did I Get home? When exactly did I black out last night? Who did I fuck over? How much money did spend? Who did I offend? How long will it take today before I'm capable of interacting with other humans?"..Every morning every day of the week regaining consciousness with some variation on those panicked thoughts.  (If I even slept at all.)..Now every day I wake up around the same time with a rested head aware of how I'm feeling mentally and emotionally.  It's a new lease on life for sure.
Cool. keep going!
