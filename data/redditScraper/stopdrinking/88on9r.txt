Morning everyone (6am here in Scotland). Woke up bright an early feeling good and excited for the day ahead something I'd never do when hungover to death. It truly never gets old this feeling. Even thought it's been 5 months I still get cravings but moments like this are a stark reminder as to why I'm committing to a sober life. To anyone struggling this is one of the main things that keeps me focused knowing that I'll wake up without that skin crawling shame nausea sweats and overall anxiety hell it motivates me to keep going and hope it does for you too. ..IWNDWYT!
