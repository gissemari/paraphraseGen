Number four makes me NOT want to read! My alcoholic brain doesn't need ANY encouragement at all. Shame cos rest sounds good!
Thank you for the suggestion. I just placed a hold on this book at my library.
Hope you don't mind I'm reading up on some of your old posts. Been kind of not as present here on SD of late and missed some good stuff...like posts from you!..This one has always really bugged me:..&gt; Myth #5: There's nothing you can do for someone with a drinking problem until he or she is ready...I hear that so many time and it makes me want to pull my hair out. Bullshitbullshitbullshit. No we cannot control whether or not someone wants to pick up a drink today but there are definitely things we can do starting with showing our care and concern. I think I'm going to pick this book up just to see what she says on the subject...Btw just as a case study: my dad was a 40 year daily alcoholic who now only drinks on holidays and weekends. That said he can be a major ass during the week when something goes awry and he wants a drink. ;-) I have tried to show him how much easier and more enjoyable it is to just quit but I guess at 75 he's not hearing it.
