I am at the hospital thank goodness my mom does not have cancer.  The dr told me "highly likely" she would have cancer this morning.  .Ughh !.Problem #1. My sister is staying over tonight.  She will want to have wine.   And would like to drink a bottle.  My sister will have 2 glasses tops and go to bed.   Normally I would share a bottle with her and have another one hidden for later.  .Problem #2.  Everything I do regarding work stuff is very slow I am way behind.  I have my own business therefore.It will effect my income.  To be perfectly honest in the past I made significant financial mistakes by multitasking or footy brain putting orders in on the fly.    It just that I feel like I am living in slow motion quite frankly I am bored.  I also feel very lazy.   Just want to read or watch tv.    No motivation.  ..Good news I didn't drink last night.  I get my mom to the hospital @ 6:30 am.  My mom is very difficult to get moving and is suffering from dementia.     When I am around her my anxiety levels sky rocket.  I also have no patience and I am cranky because I can't drink wine.  .Last night my mom was sleeping at my house. She woke up last night at 2:30 am and attempted to walk her dog in her PJ's barefoot in the freezing cold.   If I had drank I would not have woken up.  God knows she could have fallen or got confused in the freezing cold. ..So that is my goodness.  I was present

I stopped drinking for 13yrs once and then started drinking again. My experience was that it took a lot longer than 10 days to get up to anything like half steam. On the other hand I was not pissing every penny I had up against the wall...Everything I achieved in those 13 yrs had enduring value for myself or someone else. Particularly my now former wife and our son. Even my experience of going back drinking could help someone one day...Your example of being there for your mother is a classic example of the benefits of not drinking...You are doing great --- I will not be drinking tonight also. Posts like yours give me hope.
