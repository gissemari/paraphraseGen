Hi guys I'm really glad to have found this place as I've made the decision to quit drinking and know I will need support. I've always had a poor relationship with alcohol and it has been a factor in the breakdown of my two long term relationships as I have a tendency to act like a crazy irrational person after a few drinks. I would say that lately I have been much more sensible with my drinking and am more likely to stay within a reasonable limit where I don't act quite so insane but I still drink way too much way too late and struggle to stop after I have the first one. It has also become an every weekend thing now instead of once or twice a month. This is a factor in my decision to quit now. .The other factor is that I have an incredibly busy and stressful life. I am a teacher working an hour away which means I drive 2 hours a day and have a very heavy workload even when I get home and I have a 3 year old daughter. I simply can't handle my workload when I'm out every Saturday getting drunk and I can't enjoy my Sundays with my daughter or keep my house tidy or prepare for work on a Sunday when I'm exhausted or hungover. ..As I say I've always had a bad relationship with alcohol but it has become a weekly habit now I think partially down to the breakdown of my relationship with my daughter's father. He moved on very quickly while I decided to stay single for a while and enjoy life. I think subconsciously I'm drinking to escape the hurt of him leaving me- I think by putting pictures up of me having a good time on facebook I'm rubbing it in his face and to escape the stress of my life- but I'm now at the point where I have no feelings for him I've dealt with the break up and I don't feel the need to prove a point anymore and drinking makes stress worse because it gives me less time to balance everything. In my efforts to escape I've become promiscuous and a binge drinker and the life and soul of the party. While I do love and accept myself the way I am I love other parts of my life more. I love my daughter I love my job and I love my family and friends and I'm ready to throw myself into these things instead of committing my weekends to getting drunk and being hungover..I do have wonderful friends and to be honest I'm by far the worst one and the driving force behind us always getting drunk and going out. One of my closest friends is abstinent another is quitting with me and the third in the group will be supportive even if she doesn't quit with us. We do spend time together sober they will come round on nights I have Emily and spend time watching TV with me etc. .My family will also be supportive. My Dad suggested moderation but I explained that I don't think that is an option as once I start I can't stop and he agreed...Me and my friend I'm quitting with have decided to set realistic targets. Our first is a month. We originally decided the start date would be 6th March- my 25th Birthday but now I'm quite eager to get started. For my birthday I have planned to go to laser quest and nandos so not drinking on my birthday should be okay. We had planned to go out afterwards but this is not necessary. ..I'm hoping that giving up drinking will give me more time back time to balance everything I have going on. I hope it will give me more time to work out again and get healthier. And I'm looking forward to taking long drives going to the cinema more having games nights and going bowling instead of always drinking. I'd also like to do more art. ..So that's me! Hi guys!

Welcome! You've taken the most important step realizing you need to make a change. Moderation as you've realized isn't for everyone. I know I wasn't one who was capable of it and once I start I can't stop without running out. It's awesome to have a friend you can quit with and support each other. Why waste another weekend though? Start today and get those sober days adding up! I wish you the best of luck and make sure you stop in here if you feel the need to vent or just ask questions. I've found it a great help!
