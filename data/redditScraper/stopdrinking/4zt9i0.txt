You've got this!
You're balancing very nicely!..I know for me the early days were critical!  I got support and fellowship in meetings and a counselor helped me.  Are you doing some if that?..Just for today I don't drink with you.
Congrats on 11 days! You've got a very big safety net here! :)
Great analogy.  Practice practice practice and you'll get it.
Deano01 good analogy! And it's fun once you get the hang of it. You have great support here. I will not drink with you today!
11 days here too and feeling you! I'm focused on the productivity and the things I want in the future. Also focused on coffee at the moment. ..Not drinking today.
