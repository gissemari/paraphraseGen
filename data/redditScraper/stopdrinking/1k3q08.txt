Just jumped on a moment ago and noticed that /r/stopdrinking now sports 10000 members. Thanks **everyone** mods contributers skeptics drunks sobernauts AA folks and non-AA folks lurkers relapsers slippers and of course those who care about all of the above. The evidence is that this place has helped many me included. Let us pat ourselves on the back for making this imperfect wonderful place.

Hear hear!   I probably wouldn't be sober if not for /r/stopdrinking.  Thanks everyone. And by everyone I mean you.  And you and you and you. [But mostly you](http://s4.hubimg.com/u/3660863_f520.jpg).  .
This subreddit deserves an award! Where on reddit is there a more supportive productive safe place?
The best on line recovery tool I have found and I looked for a few.  Well done everyone!
Woot...just signed up today

I am a fan of many sub-reddits but this one actually makes the world a better place.   Infinitely better for me and those I love.   
Kudos to all the sobernauts on [/r/stopdrinking](/r/stopdrinking)!  Hard to believe that when I stumbled across this place 275 days ago there weren't half the current number.  Here's to helping 10000 more achieve sobriety!
I joined about 2 minutes ago - maybe I was number 10000?
crazy...when I started we were 3500 ..give or take...*'We are legion'*...............................
Right on :)
I have found a better outlet on /r/stopdrinking than in any AA meeting I've ever been to. I owe a debt of gratitude to every member. And I encourage lurkers to join. You can still have fun when you're sober. :)
This is an awesome place.  I've met some amazing supportive wonderful people here.  This community helped me build what I think is a rock solid foundation for sobriety...Thanks for posting sunjim!
Great subreddit. Very supportive and rarely any drama/controversy. I remember lurking here too scared to post and tell everyone what an emotional mess I was. If you are lurking we WILL support you when you're ready! Thank you to the mods and the people who contribute to and keep this subreddit growing and going.  
Got my life back here there's no better endorsement than that. This place is like my childhood home - I'm often too busy to visit but when I do I feel that old familiar comfort. Have a great sober day!
Woo Hoo!  Glad to be a part of this place.  Funny thing I've been around for months but only just the other day actually clicked the "subscribe" button to put it on my front page... doh!  I'm a slow learner I guess.
This subreddit got me to 97 days and then it pulled me out of a month of misery and back to day #4 and counting. The overwhelming passion and encouragement people share here is humbling. I'm not surprised at all 10000 people have found their way here. Our problem is one that many many people can relate to so thank you to everyone listed in the OP's post.
This subreddit helped me a lot. Thank you guys!!

It's only been 11 days for me but I don't think I could have done it without this subreddit.  Thanks guys!!!
Thank you to the mods for keeping this subreddit a safe respectful informative and supportive corner of the internet. ..What happens here is a spiritual experience.
I'm proud to count myself as member here with all you awesome sobernauts.  We're all getting our lives back one day at a time thanks internet-people!
