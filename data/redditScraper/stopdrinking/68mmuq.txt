And it's thanks to you guys!  I don't have any IRL support to help me with my drinking so finding this subreddit was a godsend.  It's been such a huge help to read about your struggles and experiences and know that there are so many of you who have overcome the addiction...I'll be going in to work on a Monday bright-eyed and bushy-tailed rather than tired anxious and dehydrated.  It's a great feeling! :)

My alcoholism brought me here. Posts such as yours keep me coming back!..You're awesome thanks for sharing!
I'm in the same boat man. Probably 8 years for me and it's so nice not to wake up and immediately need to gulp down 2 huge cups of water and then go to work feeling like shit and bloated like mad. Keep it up man and I will too!
