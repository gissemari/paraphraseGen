I've searched through posts about sleep here already and most people are having the same problem with sleep that is falling asleep...I'm not having that problem I read a book until my eyes droop then just set the book down and I'm out like a light...The problem I'm having and wondering if other people are having is that my sleep feels much less restful. I slept through my alarm this morning which I would have never done before. I used to get between 5 and 6 hours a night and that was fine. This last week I've pushed that up to 8 hours to overcome the fatigue but I still struggle to get out of bed and feel tired throughout the day...I know this is not the normal sleep problem people have when they stop drinking but I was hoping there were other people experiencing the same thing or who could give advice.

You're sleep cycles might be all screwed up. Were you drinking a lot just to get to sleep?? If you were you're brain might still not be used to you not using alcohol to put it to sleep. Alcohol is very disruptive for sleep and REM sleep. Quitting drinking can also effect the sleep cycles/pattern as well. Your brain just needs more time to adjust. How much were you drinking??
