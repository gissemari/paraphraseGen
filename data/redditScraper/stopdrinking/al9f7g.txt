My sugar cravings were through the roof the first couple sober weeks and while they've died down a little bit I'm still struggling with craving sweets all the time. .I gotta start tracking calories and getting that under control. I always feel better when I'm eating healthier foods but I fell out of the habit when I quit drinking. .Anyone else ready to shape up their diet?

Yes! I've gained like 8 pounds since I quit. Not good!!
I ate more ice cream in the first 4 months or so after quitting than I did in 20 years. Now in my 8th month not at all anymore. But for those few months I was just like... let it go it's better than alcohol.
Ive done months here and there of not having sugar and then falling off the wagon ( just like my drinking !) I'm currently focused more on my not drinking that not eating sugar but I've found over time my body craves it less - I find planning my meals and upping my protein really helps to sustain me . My sugar dip is around 3pm in the after so I try* and have something else to hand. .Good luck I know the feeling as I've got s terrible sweet tooth !!
When drinking I could take or leave sweet stuff (would much rather plunge the calories into wine).  Now though I'm getting loads of sugar and carb cravings.  ..At some point I'll deal with it for now I've got enough on my mind   x
Sugar cravings are starting to slow down over here. I give myself the time it needs. Well done on 58!! IWNDWYT
