Hello everyone. I'm posting here because I need to. And because I want to. The TL;DR is that I really gotta stop. I'm going to be 37 in 19 days. Had a blood test 3 weeks ago that showed slightly elevated ALT AST (liver enzymes) levels. Was told by my doctor to abstain from alcohol for 6 weeks and be retested because I'm on cholesterol meds. I made it 2 days sober after I got the results but relapsed...I've been drinking every day for at least 9 years. Started after a bad breakup. I have Cerebral Palsy and I use a motorized wheelchair. I rely on people to help me on a daily basis. Last night I drank too much vodka and pissed myself. Not proud of it. Not fair to my care attendants to have to deal with self-induced incontinence...Anyway I hate that I can't even hold myself accountable. I always have good intentions but evening rolls around and I get bored and want to relax so I have a drink. At least 4 every night. Sometimes more. I don't get drunk every night but at least 3 nights a week I do. I tell myself every day that I'm not gonna drink. Then I do it anyway. I have no willpower. So.....Thanks for reading this and letting me vent. Asking for positive vibes I guess. From people who know the struggle.

You got this man I'm struggling with early sobriety myself right now so I completely understand. Just remember that you're worth it.
Welcome aboard!..The experience you describe with alcohol is very common and you're definitely not alone.....Addiction isn't a matter of a lack of willpower or a weakness character flaw or moral failing or anything of the sort.....[This talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2emgrRoT2c) by Dr. Kevin McCauley is an excellent overview of the brain science behind it which helped me to understand what was really going on.....I found the book '*Alcohol Explained*' and the book/YouTube '*This Naked Mind*' really helpful for understanding my drinking problem and permanently changing the way I view alcohol - they are well worth a look and made all the difference for me in stopping for good without feeling like I was missing anything or depriving myself... ..Were you honest with the doctor about the amount and frequency of your drinking? There are various medical options that can help you stop and stay stopped which might be worth looking into.....Best of luck and keep us posted!..I won't drink with you today ..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
I can relate to so much that you say.  For me it was 26 years of this struggle.  I too promised myself that this drink is the very last one and that from tomorrow onwards I will not drink. Stop and start and stop and start.  All those efforts to stop (albeit for a very short time) paid off because one of those stops became a day then two then three ... I am rooting for you!
Seconding reading This Naked Mind

I just wanted to let everyone know that I made it through today without drinking. Even with family and friends around me doing it. My inner voice kept telling me that I could have one beer and it would be OK. But I just kept on drinking my flavored seltzer water. Thanks to everyone for their kind words and The links to the informational material. Day one is under my belt. Good night everyone.
