Good Morning/Afternoon    .Theme: Discipline     .**"Discipline is not a dirty word."- Pat Riley**    .What I get from it:  Discipline has many negative connotations but I need self discipline to stay sober. For the most part I believe in the disease concept of addiction but saying "I'm sick" or "its my disease" still is not and excuse to relapse. I have to have self discipline or all my tools and knowledge about combating my addiction is all in vain.    .Thank You for reading you help keep me sober.    . .~INY

I thought drinking would give me freedom. Instead it gave me bondage. Only though discipline was I truly set free.
