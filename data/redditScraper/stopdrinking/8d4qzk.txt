Why oh why did i think kt was a good idea to get otc valium and beer wine etc. With my gf family too. Being an addict is so beyond comprehension fucked up. Listen people dont fucking relapse. Dont do it you wont he pappy about it but you may feeling borderline suicidal amd stressed.(im fine) just fucking pissed im starting over. Dont do it. Go for a run read cook eat  7 tubs of ben and jerrys or help the homeless. If youre an addict like me though DO NOT FUCKING USE. ..Meant to say i was in SOuth eSt asia

You came right back though.  That's the main thing.  Sailing away on a bender is where it's a real game changer.  Getting straight back to the life you want takes courage.
