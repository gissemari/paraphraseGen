For a long time I kept on relapsing I'd string together 20 days 30 days. I think my previous longest time was 53 days. But here I am a year sober.  For you new people I just want to say don't give up.  I'd like to thank everyone at the IRC channel for putting up with me all these years and r/stopdrinking. Like my previous posts said I kinda stayed away in the early days but it was really helpful as time went on.  And now a few notes/resources I hope helps someone in my situation.. **A few things kept me going and I'd like to share it with you:**..\- Life is short. Personally I was about to hit 40. I didn't want to be a 40 something drunk. That was a big motivator...\- Day 3-4 was the hardest for me. I knew that after multiple attempts. But I had gotten past that. I could do it...\- For the most part it gets easier. If you had 20 days before you can have 20 days again. Don't use this to an excuse a relapse though. If you can do a week you can do 52 of them...\- A lot of it was just willpower at first walking one foot in front of the other pas the liquor store. ..\- I had finally given up on moderating after numerous failed attempts...\- I had finally given up the idea that I was being more 'social' by drinking I had completely isolated myself...\- I was just really really done...**The benefits:**..\- I sleep like a log..\- I've lost 30+ lbs..\- No more panic attacks...\- I can remember things..\- My apartment is clean (so is my car for the most part first time in years)...\- My stomach problems are gone...\- I've had a lot more professional success...\- I've hiked a ton of mountains!..\- I ran my first 5k!..\- I have two open source projects now. I'm getting ready to tackle my fear of public speaking on one of them soon...\- I've actually been a lot MORE social dating and hanging out with people because I'm not afraid of making an ass of myself...**Stuff I'm still working on:**..\- It's kinda lonely. Most people in their late 30s are married or in a similar situation I was in. I end up hanging out with 20 somethings but it can be a bit awkward...\- You have to deal with your demons in my case depression. I've started seeing a psychiatrist this past month and meditating regularly...\- You have to learn to deal with shit. Romantic rejection a set back at work your car breaking down. You need to behave like an adult instead of a baby sucking on it's bottle. It can be rough at first...**Books I really thought were helpful:**..\- At first: Powerless No Longer and Out There..\- Later: 10&amp;#37; Happier and the Mindful Way Through Depression...**Earlier posts**..[How I did it](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/7dssd8/friend_asked_came_to_me_to_ask_how_i_did_it_this/) (controversial and not popular)..[6 Months](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/7n7vcq/6_months_life_gets_better_dont_give_up/)..[300 days](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/8fy5f5/day_300_we_will_stay_sober_in_the_shade/)

Congrats. I forgot about the stomach issues. That is one of my main positives over the past year. Didn't realize it was the alcohol the whole time messing with my stomach.
