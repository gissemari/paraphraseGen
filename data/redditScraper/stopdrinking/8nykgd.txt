Just wanted to post an update on here because I like this sub and it was a great resource for me in my first couple months of sobriety...I have six months of sobriety now and to be honest I'm struggling. Things are definitely way better than they were when I was drinking but there's still that underlying anxiety and depression that I've had for pretty much my whole life...I'm going to give meditation another crack. I used to meditate at least 20 minutes a day for about 8 months I think but I was high pretty much every time. Now I'll be doing it sober. I'm hoping this will help me shake all this negative thinking because it feels like anxiety is preventing me from enjoying life...I wish I was giving a more encouraging and inspirational update right now. Things have definitely improved. I just wish they were better. I could definitely work on being more grateful for the good things that are going on...Anyways thanks for reading and IWNDWYT....Peace

Good job on getting to six months! Hope things start looking up for you soon meditation does help me with anxiety FWIW...I feel like I'm in a similar place though I don't have as much time as you. Some days are great and some are awful. I'm still 100% better off than when I was drinking compared to then my depression has basically disappeared. But I still have those days sometimes and I don't know wtf to do with them.
