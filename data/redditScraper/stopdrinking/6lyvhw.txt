Welp I did it. I made it 100 whole days without drinking. Holy shit...Sometimes I look back on my first posts to dryalcoholics or on here and look at how bad I felt about drinking and how much I was miserable and struggling and NEVER thought I would give up drinking...Well here we are at 100 whole days of sobriety. It hasn't been some perfect clear happy ending of a thing but at least I proved to myself I don't NEED alcohol. I don't need it I don't deserve it for any hard feat I've done and boy does not drinking solve wuite a few problems...No more headaches no more drunk math no more not looking the Rite Aid check out lady in the eye no going on walks in the middle of the night no risk of forgetting my pin number no more puking no more needing to be babysat by my boyfriend no more making an ass of myself to people I thought Inwas attracted to online behind the bf's back. A lot of problems are solved by just not drinking. The only way to win the drinking game is to not play...Here's to another 100 friends.
