I stopped drinking abruptly on 30 Nov 2010...no medication no mumbo-jumbo no AA nothing...just stopped cold turkey...I am now 50 and have been drinking from the time I was around 30 with about 10 years of drinking daily. Of these the last few years involved heavy drinking sometimes from dawn to dusk. Drink of choice was vodka. I've done many foolish things in my cups (too many too embarrassing to recount) but otherwise have been a successful professional husband father and member of the community...On 30th Nov 2010 I was talking to an older friend who explained how he almost died due to chronic & acute pancreatitis caused by sustained heavy drinking. I guess his testimony triggered the decision to quit (although the pressure was building up gradually from other sources). ..Today I don't miss alcohol nor do I crave it. I've attended several parties where free alcohol was served & have been on at least four international flights over over 15 hours length (and where alcohol was served freely) but am yet to feel any temptation. I do read CA frequently though and feel happier that I quit each time I read it!..Understandably my wife who was willing to tolerate a relapse or two is the happiest in my family...Drinking was nice. Stopping was nicer.
