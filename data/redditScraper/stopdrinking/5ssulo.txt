Here I am approaching 87 days for the first time in a loooong time.  I've been virtually on autopilot since I got through the first month as far as abstaining is concerned.  Haven't thought about drinking in quite a while other than in the context of "hrmm I thought I'd feel better..."  ..Since I stopped drinking I have lost 15lbs and am at my ideal weight I returned to school full time I met a girl that I like who also does not drink (not in recovery just happens to not like alcohol) and I rekindled a love of an old hobby (hockey)...I've been fairly proactive about improving my life since I stopped and even a bit before then.  I'm eating better although that could always be better.  I feel physically healthy and capable.  I don't have any real desire to drink.  School is going smoothly.  Relationship is healthy.  Hockey is fun.  But.....I still feel pretty unsatisfied.  Bored even.  Spending a lot of time on reddit (need to stop this) and watching TV at night in place of going out socializing.  Sobriety has been isolating in that way.  I'm struggling to continue to find justification for why i'm doing it.  The biggest reason I stopped was for my physical well being and that is what keeps me going but boy do I miss having such an easy way to turn off all of the unease that churns inside me.  ..If even with a girlfriend friends decent job studies and a hobby life is not providing satisfaction what is one to do?  Antidepressants?  I really hate that possibility but I feel like I need to keep throwing new "improvements" at my life as an answer to the discontent I feel.  Meditate more eat better travel more etc.  There is only so much one can do before it just doesn't feel worth it.  If you're not going to feel content then you're not going to feel content.  ..Anyway it's when I start feeling this way that I suddenly remember I can drink and make all these thoughts temporarily go away.  Eventually I will feel like shit and my problems will compound into something much worse but I'll get momentary respite.  It's that escape that is so alluring.  That temporary shedding of the weight of life through the bottle that only ever tempts. ..I'm not going to drink though.  I know it isn't worth it.  I just wish my reason for not drinking was because life without it IS worth it.  It doesn't feel that way sometimes.

I had the same feelings.  I did get hobbies but eventually I wanted socialization.  The two weren't the same.  My hobbies especially at first were all solo ones so I had to force myself to start getting together with like-minded people.  If your issue is feeling isolated at night are there some of your friends you can get together with?  I had to get creative with getting together with friends as our go-to used to be 'let's go to a bar'.  Still there were other activities we could do...My life didn't instantly get better when I stopped drinking but it sure was getting worse while I was.  Great job on the 3 months and I won't drink with you today!
This post hits close to home for me. How does one deal with the existential pain of general existence? I know for me I drank to cover up things I didn't like about myself or experiences that I didn't want to feel. So of course taking the booze away doesn't fix any of that I'm still me. I romanticize about going back to booze but rationally I know it will not solve anything. In fact in the long run it will just make everything worse. I'm trying to be patient with myself I lived a certain way for a long time I know it will take a long time before I can learn a new way that works for me. I hope to find something that I'm truly passionate about someday. I hope the same for you and I wish you all the best! Be well my friend...
