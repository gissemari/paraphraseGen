...and I should be happy but the problem is I just don't feel anything right now. I'm struggling with anxiety and depression that just makes every single minute drag by.  I can't go back to drinking or I'll die. There's too much at stake. But now that I've decided I'm sober what to do other than just not drink? I feel empty..

Volunteering helped me occupy my time and it felt good.
Please be patient. We didn't develop a problem over night and we won't solve it overnight. Just know that it gets better. It takes at least 10 days for the drug to leave your body. Anxiety and depression are side effects. You can do this!  Try and stay busy and try and go for a walk.
Everything seemed to be in black and white when I got sober. Took a little while for the color to come back into my life. I filled my time with meetings reading listening to music exercise. It was hard because I didn't want to do any of it. It got better. Joy returned. Now things that I thought I needed alcohol to enjoy are fun and more meaningful than ever before while I was drinking. 
Magnesium supplements helped me alot with balancing things out in the body. Annie Grace from the 30 day alcohol experiment explains the science of it better and her information/guidance is unbelievably effective in changing ones relationship with alcohol.
It takes some time. Don't get discouraged. This is now how you will feel like in the future.
