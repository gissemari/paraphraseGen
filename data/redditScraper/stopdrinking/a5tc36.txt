For me I long ago admitted to myself I am alcoholic. I also have no fear or shame in telling anyone I meet that I am (with a few professional related exceptions). ..I know many here feel deep shame and guilt about it but I have found being honest with others even relative strangers very liberating...For a positive example last week I had my contact exam. The....tech?....taking all my info is going down a list of questions. Some basic (height weight etc) then the lifestyle questions...Her: Do you smoke? ..Me: Nope...Her: How often do you drink?..Me: (For the life of me I couldn't tell you why it came out this way) 33 days sober today...Her: Congrats! That's absolutely awesome!..Her tone of voice face and body language all showed she was legitimately happy for me. It didn't last long and we moved on...My point is the reassurance and support we can get often comes from unexpected sources. ..A lot of people out there really do understand our struggle.

I usually try to avoid speaking in generalities but let me do just that.  In my experience just about everyone respects a recovering addict.  It is when you get to active addicts or relapsed addicts that people's opinions tend to diverge.

Agreed!

I would find it odd even as a person who understands where you are coming from if any relative stranger I met told me they were an alcoholic in a casual day to day encounter.  
I agree. I might not say I'm an alcoholic but I dont mind saying I dont drink anymore. I've had pleasant interactions with cashiers and stuff joking around if I'm buying ice cream and soda that I don't drink so I gotta get my kicks elsewhere. ..I find older people especially are very understanding. I think everybody once they reach a certain age has seen at least a few people be destroyed by drugs and alcohol so they can respect that decision a lot.
