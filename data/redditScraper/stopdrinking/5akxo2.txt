Without doubt today would be a day for a big fat takeout most likely a pizza. But when not drinking I feel it's hard to justify/it needs justifying .

Keep track of your finances. You're definitely saving money but try not to spend too frivolously. I order takeout every few weekends when I'm working from home and don't want to go out. New clothes are also a great purchase. Looking like a new person helps you feel like one too. Good luck!
I find it much easier to justify a few frivolous things since I've been sober. After all I've not spent roughly 4K since I quit on booze. Treat yourself!
I think I understand your sentiment. I am addicted to alcohol. Not physically now thank god but it was habit. I don't have any other addictions. So alcohol was just something I "needed". Other things came second to that a lot. ..It's hard for me to "treat myself" to things because alcohol stopped being a treat/fun/stress reducer a long time ago so I don't know what treating myself means... outside of self care...I drank tea during the day today which is something I've never done. I realized I wanted to relax after an interview I had. It was an awesome impulse.
