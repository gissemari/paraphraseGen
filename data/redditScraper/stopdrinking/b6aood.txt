I just can't seem to keep it going. I can do three months two months two weeks without drinking without really wanting to drink but I always relapse. If I'm being honest I just don't care about myself. I don't care about my health. I don't really care about being happy. This is my form of self harm and it's so hard to convince myself to even want to stop. ..I just feel very alone. Alcohol has plagued me for years and even after all the things I have lost (friends. a relationship I valued above everything. Time.) I cannot kick it. I'm not sure why I'm making this post. I just want to feel some support...Thanks for reading.

I'm sorry if it's any consolation you are NOT alone in your struggles. I've been the same way only I'll stop for a few days then fall hard back into old habits. I'll be happy for the 2 week mark! Hopefully you can find some way to stop this cycle.... hang in there. You CAN do this. 
I've just come to realize I haven't gone more than a week without drinking for like 7 or 8 years. One time I got about a month sober. ..What's weird is I try to convince myself I care about my health with my eating habits but completely ignore the negative effects of binge drinking and smoking. 
It might help to try and pinpoint and resolve the underlying issues first..
Have you been evaluated for depression? There are tons of effective meds available nowadays. FWIW.
