I drank at work on 6/30. My first relapse after treatment made it almost 2 months clean at that time. I've been on suspension for almost 2 weeks and finally today had a meeting where I resigned in lieu of termination. They offered that option. Feeling like shit though. I'm so down. I want to drink to numb this. But I can't. It's not an option anymore. I have resources and need to keep using them. I have a sponsor AA friends family around. My mom is with me I'm not feeling strong enough to be alone while my husband is at work. I'm angry because this is my fault. I'm angry because I ruined it all lost a good job with a promising growth potential. I just feel si sad and lost and I don't know what to do next. Where do I go? Where do I work or make money? ..Fuck.
