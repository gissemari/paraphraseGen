Hey everyone it's Wednesday that means the week's half over! How's it been going? Share your triumphs struggles or just general chat!..Triumph: Got back to my strength training today - I had to take it easy last week after twisting my back weird.  I still can't deadlift without pain :(..Struggle: Work.  I'm feeling either bored frustrated or stressed out.  I'm doing my best to do what makes me happy outside of the office and that's helping...General chat: Freaking Canadian weather - great sunny day yesterday 15CM of snow today...Have a good 24 hours folks!
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph: 30 days of sobriety...Struggle: My brain.  It's been used improperly for the last 22 years.  I am trying to understand why I think the way I do and where these thoughts come from. Weird...Chat: I am actively working the steps with a sponsor and without him and the steps I would be as sick today as I was a month ago. That's a fact.
Triumph: Went to an acoustic night last night was the only one without a drink no-one even questioned me (that hasn't actually happened before so it was a nice change). Today I'm feeling incredibly cheerful too!  .Struggle: Housemate overdosed last week so I've been pretty shaken up. Been feeling generally quite miserable and had pretty bad cravings but I'm in a really good mood today and as far as I can tell she's fine again now.  .General chat: Finally got around to doing lots of work for university went to a problem class and could actually do everything for once. So school is going excellently. Might treat myself to a nice afternoon out with my friends.
Thanks for posting these.  I look forward to them...**Triumph**:..100 days!  Whoopee!  I'm feeling really good about my recovery.  I'm making progress in my SMART facilitator training attended my first AA meeting on Sunday (and will go back) and have been having deep conversations about my recovery with close friends and family...Work is crazy.  I've had a few frustrating days that would have previously sent me over the edge in the past and I would have ended up angry sad and passed out on the couch.  But I've handled it well this week.  I called and talked to my dad instead of popping open a beer.  I'm proud of myself for getting through things that were huge excuses for me before...**Struggle**:..Even though my mind is more engaged at work again some things are suffering and it's a collection of shit hitting the fan all at once.  I've gotten some nastygrams from management about a couple projects that are falling behind.  But I can only do what I can do.  My team is getting through them and it will pass...**General Chat**: ..I think I'm at the point in my fitness/weight loss where I need to make changes to my diet.  I've made subtle changes so far (eating breakfast for instance) but I think I need to cut back on eating as much of or the kinds of things I eat to get through the next 30 pounds.  I'm down to 249 (from 288 in July but up from 248 as of last Thursday).  I've got a way to go though...Here's to another day in the books (/me raises his coffee mug)!
Triumph: I feel pretty awesome. I've got 18 days under my belt and I am just so darn proud of myself. I've been completing projects at home. I painted my bedroom and am building myself a workshop. Work has been fantastic. I've felt really strong. My self-respect and self-esteem is returning...Struggle: I stopped taking a sleep aid after the first week and I usually fall asleep without too many problems but I am waking up a lot in the middle of the night and getting up earlier than I want to not getting quite enough sleep. And the sugar cravings at night! I woke up in the middle of the night and ate a bunch of chocolate without hardly realizing it. Anyone else doing this?..General chat: I feel like the pieces of my life are falling into place. I don't want to rush through the rest of winter I am excited about the work I am doing on myself but at the same time I feel this sense of giddiness like I am about to have the best spring/summer/year I've had in a loooong time.

Triumph:  One honest week.  Back at it and more motivated than ever to stay sober...Struggle: The guilt of having walked back into the fire last week.  That last foray into the land of booze was rough ridiculous and crazy.  Although I came out of it with a solidified resolve to not drink I feel like I was too reckless and my drinking could have really hurt me...Chaat:  [I really love Chaat.](http://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/papdi-chaat-delhi-papdi-chaat-recipe/)
Triumph- New e-cig. Keeps my hands busy. Wrote some good shit...Strugle- I would literally kill a million of the cutest babies for a Strongbow right now. Work sucks. Those little bolts of "OMG BEER NAO YOU STUPID WHY IS NOT IN MY FACE" cravings that happen right after I finish work. Ugh.
Good job everyone!..Triumph: SO is out of town and I've made good plans not to drink even though I could "get away with it."..Struggle: SO is out of town.  It's hard to manage the kids and schedules and some minor urges to drink.  SO being out of town used to mean extra drinking...General chat: we got chickens!  They are little chicks now and they are in a brooder.  When they get old enough they'll go in the backyard coop.  Later we'll have fresh eggs.
Hi everyone!..Triumph: 9 months today. I also lost 40 lbs as a result of not eating a bunch of junk food after drinking so many liquid calories. It feels GREAT...Struggle: I need to start working but I get so nervous and critical of myself because it's been awhile since I had a regular job. I end up depressed confused about where to start looking...General Chat: I just stopped playing World of Warcraft after EIGHT years of wasting my time on it. Started reading more instead. If anyone has a book suggestion let me know! I usually read heavy philosophy sort of things looking for some light fiction something fun.
**triumph** JBH ran a SMART-style meeting in IRC this weekend. From it I gained some new insight into some of my issues...**struggle** The belly is too damn fat!  I'm struggling to stay away from cookies and embrace my inner exerciser...**how's the weather** The snow is finally melting here leaving behind ugliness and uncovering fresh damage.
Yay!  Ha when I woke up today I thougt "oooh What's up Wednesday". Thanks NoMoreBeersPlease.  :)..Triumph:  Double-fisted... today marks thirty days of booze sobriety!  Best decision I've made in a long time...In addition I got a raise and promotion today!  Out of the blue!  Which is pretty great because I'd been seriously considering changing jobs due to my boredom.  Now I'm challenged and making more money.  Pretty sweet!..Another triumph would be knowing in my heart that I'm not going to celebrate by getting shitfaced.  I already have plans this weekend that involve partying so tonight I'm going to take all of the excited emotions around my promotion and just have a chill night at home.  It feels amazing to know that...Struggle:  Not drinking has ratcheted up my desire for sweets -- cookies ice cream etc.  I'm starting to see the effects.  Gotta learn moderation! (If I can.)..General chat:  Hi guys! *waves*
Triumph: Back to work getting new sponsor :)
Almost two months in.  My sleep patterns are erratic and my moods are volatile...Triumph: I can walk past my old watering holes without a thought...Challenges: I am having trouble finishing my senten....
Triumph: I made it to day 5. I've been in a hotel since Monday and I haven't touched the minibar and haven't ordered any beer or booze to my room. The fact that the minibar is untouched actually makes me proud. As long as I'm in this room grabbing a beer is just 5 seconds away and I didn't...Struggle: Yesterday was rough. All of my colleagues on this project went to watch a soccer game and I made up some lame ass excuse because I knew I wouldn't be able to handle it. The urge to drink yesterday evening was the strongest so far (in this period of soberness anyways). I was really angry with myself because my colleagues are great people and I actually consider them friends...Also i know they wouldn't even have said a thing if I would have ordered a water but I know I would have ordered beer. The only thing that kept me from drinking was my though process of "You didn't join the others so you wouldn't drink and now you want to drink alone in your room? No!". I just went to bed at half past eight...I did plan do go to an AA meeting on Wednesday and I didn't. The thought still weirds me out and I have to get over that. ..Chat: I do feel better I have to say. And thanks to everyone who responded to my original thread. This certainly helped.
**triumph** 28 days today that's my month my goal.**struggle** do I continue hear the ting of my very own star make a bigger commitment to sobriety?.**chat** I'm getting by I always do.(How do I start a new line?)
