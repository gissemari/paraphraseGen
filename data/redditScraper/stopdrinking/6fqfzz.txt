[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy Hump Day! What's Up Wednesdays are when we celebrate our sobriety see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** A few years ago I had to stop driving because of alcohol-induced panic attacks. But over the past few months I started to drive again and became a safe and competent driver like I used to be. Over the weekend I made a three-day road trip from the Tampa Bay area to upstate New York near the Canadian border. Being able to get behind the wheel gave me a wonderful sense of freedom and accomplishment...**Struggle:** The man who takes care of my mother's cabin has been sober for seven years. But when we came back to the cabin unannounced after several months away we found a glass of bourbon that he had left on the kitchen counter. I am struggling with sadness over this. On the one hand I want to tell him  I am one of your tribe.  On the other hand whatever he may or may not be doing is simply **none of my business.**. .**General:** My username has come to mean so much to me yet when I first joined r/stopdrinking it was something I chose on a whim without any careful thought. It was just San Francisco which is my city  girl  as I am female and my middle name which is  Mary. ..How did *you* choose *your* username?..
----------immediate responses--------

I chose my user name because it's something I never had and want my son to have more than anything I could ever buy him. Funny thing...the best gift I can ever give my son is free. Oh and 80 is birth year.
Hey Mary I would have loved to see you in NY! Glad the driving is going well...Triumph:     1) Finally on the mend from my little accident; 2) I'm going on a date tomorrow - he's 14 years sober. I'm dating a longtimer!!..Struggle:     I'm kinda nervous - don't know how it's going to be with someone who's been through getting and staying sober for so long...General:     I'm Lisa from New York. And I'm also putting a couple of $$ on my pick for the Belmont Stakes this Saturday: Lookin At Lee ;).
Your triumph is inspiring! Though I have my license I have never really driven because of anxiety. I hope to change that too. ..Triumph: Wednesday is three weeks for me. The last few days have been nail biters but I am really proud of utilizing new skills to cope. ..Struggle: My struggle is part of my triumph. It has been a tough 7 days for reasons unrelated to alcohol. But I am grateful for the opportunities given to me by the situations themselves and by my support to relearn how to cope in a healthier way. ..General: I'm currently playing Divinity: Original Sin when it is too wet to be in the garden.   Source Hunters are the main characters. 
Triumph: stepped down a case of heart-racing anxiety tonight by focusing my thoughts on today (and only today) and talking to my sponsor. Proud to have walked through that without a drink. ..Struggle: as my first anniversary approaches I'm afraid I'm going to blow it and drink again either just before or right after that coveted milestone. I'm going on vacation over my anniversary too which means I will miss my anniversary meeting at AA and won't see my sober pals that day. Kind of wishing I had not agreed to go but the plane ticket has been bought and the deposit on the rental house has been paid so it's basically a done deal. ..General: when I created this account I would have described myself as very {cyn}ical and moody {hence the reference to poor Sybil and her multiple personalities}. 
Two weeks today! 
Triumph - I must be serious this time - I just decided to cancel a cruise vacation scheduled for late July - my first cruise - I just feel it is too soon.  I do not want to risk what I have worked so hard for.  I may even lose money on the deal - I don't care- If I would have gone even if I managed to not drink -I'm pretty sure I would have been super uncomfortable!.Struggle-I am not going on a beautiful Caribbean Cruise in July!!!! WAAAAWAAAA!!! FAMO!!!.Triumph Part two- the pride of knowing I am doing the right thing to protect my fragile sobriety !!!.General: SOB short for sober - Hop part of my last name nothing fancy!!!
Triumph - Had an excellent training this week because this time I was sober and able to be the best I could be...Struggle: My coworkers aren't very accepting of my decision at all so the peer pressure is awkward...General: I'm currently trying to be sober and I live in Francophone Africa
T: I've meet with old friends in a pub. Not missing drinking at all. ..S: I wish to be on track with personal finances. ..G: My username is a made up name of the superhero my 4 year old created in her head. She has two powers. When she sings loud she makes damage when it's silent singing she cures. Also Serka is pink and has a lot of hearts around her. This username reminds me my motivation. I have a card from her made in kindergarden with help of a teacher. It says: "daddy is my friend and superhero"
Triumph- spending an entire day today at Disneyland. 9 freakin' miles I walked! It's truly  amazing what my body is capable of when I am not pumping it full of poison. I could never have done this before physically let alone with all my hangover/withdrawal anxiety. After four months I can finally feel the benefits of allowing my body to heal. ..Struggle- becoming a functioning member of society. ..General- Jaja is a nickname of mine. I think my username has a nice ring to it. But sometimes I do wish I started another username before getting so involved in r/SD. 
Triumph: I went out last week with a group of friends and missed drinking while simultaneously not actually wanting to drink a very surreal but satisfying feeling of dignity..Struggle: life - it's too busy and actually I'm finding it hard work. I can't stope things getting to me and anxiety is stalking me. I have a CRAZY 2 weeks coming up and already feeling anxious about all the planning and thinking and general moving from one place to another this is going to require (lots of travelling and planning what to wear etc with no breaks between 3 trips and won't see my kids)..General: my other stalker: depression feels like I have shaken her off for now but acutely aware that she could return so currently very apprehensive about that even though it feels amazing not to be focussed on feeling low all the time 
When I first woke up I thought it was Friday. Ha...Triumph: 90 days. And I am ready for more. .Struggle: My mood is generally pretty low/flat right now. .General: A favorite book character. :)
Triumph: back on the track of sobriety I admitted myself that I can't moderate and i am ready to reach my previous milestone of 100 days and more :).Started a new job so that's great...Struggle: looking back at my 100 days of sobriety I had trouble motivating me a lot still..I fear that it will be the same case.
Triumph: back on the track of sobriety I admitted myself that I can't moderate and i am ready to reach my previous milestone of 100 days and more :).Started a new job so that's great...Struggle: looking back at my 100 days of sobriety I had trouble motivating me a lot still..I fear that it will be the same case.
day 10 today..went to a concert yesterday in Norway. the girl at the drinks stand double-checked if I really meant to order non-alcoholic beer. .I wasn't sure if it got lost in translation so I said extra clearly 'I don't drink alcohol' and she replied 'It's ok' :) 
Triumph-I went to my very first ever AA meeting last night.  It was as terrifying and emotional as I thought.  I'll go back but I might also try a few more meetings too.  Several people there were only there as it was court ordered and said they plan to use as soon as they are released.  That's not a helpful supportive community for me...Struggle-My spouse owns a bar.  He is heavily involved in community events.  If I want to support him I will be around alcohol and people who drink.  I'm waking up to day four and that doesn't sound too hard now but I know it will just get harder...General-my user name is the main character's name in Rudy Ray Moore's Disco Godfather because in my 20s I enjoyed getting wrecked and then watching his movies.  "Put yo weight on it!"  
I chose my name because I have long used running as a healthy drug. I'm not off the wagon I'm not on the wagon I'm gonna outrun the fuckin wagon!
T: I think I am becoming a better person. I am starting to get in shape and forcing myself to do things I don't want to everyday. When I was drinking I would maybe force myself to do something I didn't like once a week..S: My wife is still gone. I miss her a lot..G: My username is a unique name I thought of for a game.
Triumph: it may sound small but I managed to get out of bed today...Struggle: I'm transgender and neurodivergent (ADD bipolar OCD) so dealing with our health care system can be a bit tough. Today I'm struggling with following up on referrals to gender focused therapists and psychiatrists and won't be using a beer at the bar as my reward/motivation...Username: Emma's my name and something amused me about abbreviating a username to ETC.
**Triumph:** I've been working on a huge work project for over a year. Its now out in the professional world and initial feedback is extremely positive. I'm quite proud but also quite nervous to see what mistakes are exposed...**Struggle:** In laws. We've been traveling and working from my in-laws house for a couple weeks now. It's been great and a struggle. They're good examples of how I don't want to be. Except that the things that annoy us in others are often our own shortcomings....."[Embryonic Journey](https://youtu.be/lTgGBCn4e5E)" is one of several Hot Tuna songs that Ive turned to in emotional times since I was a teenager..
Triumph: My husband and I were talking about our long term financial situation retirement and whatnot which is still pretty far away for me. But when I thought of my far off future self the picture in my head didn't include drinking I no longer envision myself as the drunk old lady in a dive bar being salty. It was kind of cool to think of myself as old and not drinking. Future me does have a herd of cats though :)..Struggle: Dealing with a person that has a real 'what have you done for me lately' attitude. Nothing is ever enough. It's hard not to let it bring me down but it's their issue not mine. ..General: I decided to choose a new user name after being away from here for about 6 months I wanted a fresh start at this. I happened to be drinking some berry flavored Polar seltzer so polar+berry and also like polar bear clever right? But polarberry was taken so I threw a 3 in there and here I am :)
This morning I woke up with a star beside my name. 30 days ago I made the best decision of my life.    .I'm not sure this could have happened without the safety net I've come to rely on here at SD.         .Love to you all And have a safe and sober Wednesday!
My triumph lies in 4 days done; .And nothing to drink not a drop not one. .My struggle lies in daily nerves.And how the booze gave me all these curves. .In general I'm still feeling very new .BUT I'm glad to say:."I WILL NOT DRINK WITH YOU!".
Triumph: I made it out of the hospital alive with my liver intact and chugging along see post history if anyone is curious but it was mainly because of drinking that I got in there in the first place. I don't have to go in for blood work as often anymore (hate hate hate needles) and my ALT/AST levels are on the decline. ..Struggle: I am still recovering. My feet are swollen the jaundice in my skin is going to take 3-4 weeks to go away my eyes are bright yellow and I'm in pain a lot. Work fucking sucks I want to quit my house still hasn't sold and I just had to finance a brand new 6k AC unit because the compressor in mine died. FML..General: First I want to say Mary I love your username. I am from the Bay Area and I miss SF so much.  Mine was also made on a whim; I like cats and tails. Not super exciting but hey it sounds cute and doesn't have a bunch of numbers in it. Nothing wrong with that just not my preference. And kinda ironic right now because of my yellow cat eyes. Lol...I won't drink with you guys today have a great Wednesday everyone
Triumph: I am sitting at work on day 5 with no puffy eyes. I started cleaning my room and downsizing my stuff yesterday and for a quote for a trailer for my tiny house build. ..Struggle: Anxiety is putting up one hell of a fight. I'm doing my best to manage it and will continue to do my best to keep it in check. ..General: My username rhymes (meg and veg not vej like vegetable) it's the first 3 letters of my two names and I've been considering leaving this "persona" behind and starting fresh because to me Megveg is a joke. I want to be known as Meghan not the clown in the group MegVeg. ..I will not drink with you all today. ..
Triumph: After two previous 4 and 3 month stints of sobriety in the last 18 months this one feels more like it is built to last. The prior two times I just tried to put alcohol out of my mind entirely. Eventually it snuck up on me again. This time my approach is more strategic and I'm employing tools that are familiar to me - books and the Internet. SD has been amazing. This Naked Mind was great and I've got several others in my kindle waiting. ..Struggle: work. I left myself a mess. Trying to shut down my business because I lost my passion for it and begin a transition to a completely different career. I haven't even started that yet. Money is ok for the moment but the future terrifies me. ..General: I couldn't come up with a good username so typed almost literally the first thing that popped into my head. I don't really like it and was thinking about starting over with a new account. 
Triumph : I'll have to get back to you on that one. ..Struggle: I'm also struggling financially. I work full time and dog sit for extra money but that's not consistent so money is always tight. It's depressing. ..General: My name is what I've used online for years. I was going to use Major Boredom (a line from the Ben Folds Five song "Battle of Who Could Care Less") but the header I had for my blog at the time had this crazy monkey with wild hair so I went with Major Bedhead instead. 
Triumph: I am keeping up with housecleaning. My husband had a cleaning service come in three weeks ago and they did everything top to bottom. My goal has been to keep it that clean all the time. So far so good!..Struggle: I am back from my time with family (basically two months of caring for my dad as he was dying and my grandmother) and I don't really know what to do from here. I left my job which I was planning on doing anyway so now I get to live my life however I want. It's actually kind of scary. I worry that I will just waste my time. ..General: I'm a lady I'm from baltimore and I love getting pretty/being a "belle." Pretty simple! 
**Triumph:** Still managing to find work/make money for my bills over all health is back oohhhh &amp;&amp;&amp; I joined an "accountability group" for my diet which has the potential of winning a prize - who doesn't love something free?!..**Struggle:" I tried 30in30 with AA and grabbed a sponsor as I seemed to like it and it was working. Recently it is a struggle to make it to meetings and believe half the crap in the AA bible - I know it is all my perspective/attitude I know that the things suggested in it work i just need to get over the 1930 rich white man type of writing...**General:** Well I am a ginger so every job I have ever had has (even to this day) called me Red (oh and AA too). &amp;&amp;&amp; I am a [adrenaline junkie](https://imgur.com/a/9OkOp)... or was.... am? IDK anymore lol. I am talking bunjee jumping crowd surfing moshing snorkeling bring-it-on kinda girl. Soooo this username is an old one from when I was happy and a genuine form of myself. It was my Myspace/Username ect - long lost and abandoned but now with a new light :) ..[High Five](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg)
**Triumph:**  I have a backyard garden!  Wheee!  I've been in a community garden for 5 years and while I love it I really want to start making my home into a little garden oasis.  Now I have a cedar raised bed with hoops for keeping out critters and cold weather...**Struggle:**  Feeling weighed down by the "rat race" mentality.  Too much to do and not feeling like I can slow down and enjoy my life.  Trying to figure out how to simplify my life without losing my friendships...**General:**  Welp my username is pretty self-explanatory.  I'm a woman but very much like my father and I watch his life darken under the impact of his alcoholism.  I only came to Reddit for this sub so picked a username that fit my intent to be here.
Triumph: I managed to do the revisions for my book without a drink which wasn't even as hard as I expected. And I sent it off to the publisher! ..Struggle: everything I tried to do to celebrate sending it off backfired. Tried to go out for a nice dinner and public transport failed. Alternate food I bought sucked. Tried to treat myself with Ben and jerrys and it had clearly been thawed and refrozen tasted disgusting. Got my nails done today and the technician did a bad job. Oh well. Still not drinking. ..General: my cats chase and eat flies. Sometimes it looks like they'd really prefer to skip the eating part but they just have to follow thru on the process. 
T. Went to the Dr's today  it's only my day 2 but thought it would be the best place to start...S. Dr didn't help to be honest just told me to cut down and stay under 10 units a week. I explained that  if i have one I will just carry on drinking but I didn't get much advice except for trying AA etc..G.  I'm still pleased I did go to the Dr's and have to go back in a few weeks cannot wait to tell her I've had no drinks since my last appointment
Triumph: Made it through an anxiety-inducing evening at work - lots of public speaking presentation generally being the center of attention unwillingly which comes with the job. Also my Struggle...General: Since I know the drill for the first weeks after quitting I'm eating junk food again. Better than alcohol fwiw
I am just joining this chat room in the hope I can start drying out again.  2 years ago after great mind-searching and determination and pain I finally got myself to AA in London Kings Road.  Lovely people and vibe.  Then was given a mentor who basically told me I should leave because I was not abusive/violent/excessive enough in my alcoholism.  I was made to feel I was doing drinking all wrong.  Yet for me drinking began because of pain and without help I have gone back to drinking.  I don't know where to go next.
Triumph: Feel like I'm finally past the initial craving stage...Struggle: I'm a teacher and I'm off for the summer. I know most people would envy this much time off but whenever my schedule gets thrown off I tend to get depressed and lazy. I managed to go grocery shopping yesterday and I'm working on a house project but I'm still not doing things I NEED to do like look for a new position for the fall. ..General: I'm a pretty private person in general especially in real life but I'm thinking of trying those online SMART meetings I saw mentioned here. 
Triumph:  I got A LOT of sleep last night. 10 hours!  ..Struggle:  I'm still pretty low energy (partially due to a chronic health issue) and I have to work really hard to be kind to myself when I'm not functioning as I'd like...General:  My username is Help Me Rhonda backward.  The proper way of writing it was already taken. My name isn't Rhonda but I definitely need (and get) lots of help and support. :)
**Triumph:** I replaced a bad well pump water softener and installed a reverse osmosis filter system. My water and life have never been so clean. Happy to take two life emergencies and come out better than before...**Struggle:** Anxiety.      I seem best if I am fixing things non-stop. If I stop I start winding up. Still learning to live sober and gradually working to be better than before. ..**General:** 30 years ago my drinking name was Mattallica = Matt + Metallica. I'm a car fanatic so I added the SI extension (from Honda Civic SI). Same name all forums. I'm not really creative when it comes time for new usernames.
Triumph: I had my last drink 3 years ago today... So excited and proud of myself. It feels like yesterday I didn't think I'd make it 3 days (or probably even hours) but here I am on the eve of my third anniversary of being sober and my life has never been better!..Struggle: nothing at the moment I'm in a really good head space currently ..I created this username when I was struggling with a decision that would possibly affect my sobriety and I was worried I'd not make it to 3 years. I made a new account because my main one is the same as all my social media and I try to keep my struggles with alcohol somewhat secret (so I linger SD but don't post much).
Triumph - I got a full time job and it's super good. We work four days a week the team is so nice and friendly. I feel like for the first time in my life I am working with people not for them. I'm super proud of myself. I actually created the job out of nothing I just emailed them with a CV and they created it for me. Pretty great...Struggle - My birthday is tomorrow and fuck me my brain is just trying every trick to get me to drink. It's fucking exhausting but once I get it over with then I think it'll calm down again. It's weird I feel less confident than I did months ago but I think the pink cloud lifted and then I just had to deal with life. Ho hum. ..However I just sat and tried to remember the last time I truly enjoyed drinking and I couldn't remember. I think my last year of drinking always ended in miserable anxiety ridden hangover. So yeah I know it's just my brain playing tricks on me. ..General - Username is from a cuddly fish we won at a fair that we called chalky. 
triumph- 180 days today hot damn! I would have slapped you for lying if you told me a year ago that I could do this..struggle- The more sober time I get the more I feel like I've got to lose if I screw it up..general- I love eggplant.
Triumph: even though it was beautiful out yesterday and all I could think of was how nice it'd be to find a patio and have a drink I stayed in and stayed sober! ..Struggle: I messed up on Sunday and had drinks because I was having bad anxiety and I just wanted it to go away. The drinks made it dissipate but I felt like a failure. So I'm on day 18 total and day 3 consecutive. ..General: I'm watching a really cute dog   
**Triumph** Feeling hopeful. I've been working on being kind to myself and it's helping...**Struggle**  I have cruise coming up and I am worried about being away from my pets people drinking around me etc...**General** "ahjumma" is the Korean word for a middle aged or older woman. And I'm tiny. 
**T**:  I went to the Cub's game they won I didn't drink...**S**:  Psycho baby mama showed up at my house at 6:45 AM  didn't get back from Chi-town until late.  My daughter let her inside and she got into bed with me.  It seriously feels like a relapse.  And she give me a giant hickey on my neck...**G**:  Physis is pronounced like Fu-sis and it roughly translates to   nature in Greek.  And 81 is my birth year. 
Triumph: me not drinking is the new normal among my group of friends. No one ever mentions it anymore. ..Struggle: I'm on the fence about whether I should go back to school. I'm starting to get the itch to explore a new career but taking out more loans (and giving up two years of salary) is a huge risk. Time to embrace my network of friends and former classmates/coworkers to get their opinions about the pros and cons. ..General: my favorite album is Young Jeezy's Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101. It's filled with so many motivational gems and takes me back to a time when I had just suffered some major setbacks but still was full of optimism and hope. 
Triumph: Made it past thirty days sober so I'm feeling great about that! Plus I'm doing the work my sponsor is asking of me and that feels awesome too...Struggle: I'm still looking for a good job around the place I recently moved to. I don't want something absolutely shitty but before long that may be my only option left for a while. ..General: It is Wednesday so the week is half over. I'm going to a meeting today here in about an hour and then after that probably relaxing for the day. I may watch some House of Cards and maybe a little something else but I'm definitely far behind on House of Cards. 
Triumph: Work has never been better! I actually enjoy getting up early and clocking in nowadays. Even signed a new pay raise contract a few weeks ago which is helping me get out of my current struggle...Struggle: My father is bi-polar and has been off to the races since March. He's currently MIA but wrecking havoc on my family from where ever he is. I'm angry and worried about him. I wish he would get back on his meds and start managing his illness again. But without fail about every 10 years he goes off then it's hell for everyone. The worst part is he took our family dog with him last I heard he put the dog down. The dog was old but healthy and taken before his time. I want to rip my dad apart for that. We didn't even get to say goodbye...General: My username is a combo of an old nick name and my sobriety date. My old username was persistent with the dark gloomy mind I had before I quit. I went through hell and came back immaculate.
**Triumph:** I am navigating a new job with new people processes industry language and culture while staying totally sober and healthy. feels great!!!..**Struggle:** I'm now managing six brilliant people with PhDs in neuroscience and learning design. (I have "only" a BA in music of all things.) I struggle with feelings of academic inferiority. I need to remember that I bring many other skills and perspectives to the table which I developed working for companies in the education industry while everyone else was in grad school...**General:** Mare Nectaris is the smallest sea on the moon. I'm an astronomy nerd. these aren't actually seas of water - they're large basalt plains leftover from volcanic eruptions that just looked like seas to early astronomers. I've had a deep fondness for the moon my whole life. and just like /u/sfgirlmary I used my middle name Nectar. 
Triumph: I'm trying to eliminate needless/useless internet surfing at night before bed and go to sleep with something good in my head. I'm rereading Paradise Lost and feeling much more mentally clean before turning in...Struggle: I took a new job in March and after an initial excitement I'm not sure this company is for me. I'm trying to figure out what to do.....General: My user name is a quote from Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra. Cleopatra speaks it about Antony. It resonates...So cool to read about everyone's user name! Thanks /u/sfgirlmary :)!
Triumph - I finished logging all my food in MyFitnessPal and because I wasn't planning any wine I had 250 cals left and I spent them on Chocolate ice cream!!!..Challenge - I still have wine in the fridge and I'm not ready to throw it out yet. Not sure when I will be...General - red. I'm a redhead. Reb. Part of my first name. 0211 my two soccer numbers from when I was younger 
Hey everyone! Just wanted to drop in and say still sober and going strong! Forgot exactly how many days sober I had today. That was a weird feeling. 
Congrats OP! I love driving. It's always such a good feeling when someone tells me that they feel safe in my car. ..On that note my username comes from the days when I was 16 and drove back-country gravel roads like a madwoman.
