Went to my second meeting tonight about 40 mins from my place. It was kind of a last minute decision because I was bored lol. I had never been to that meeting before so of course I was freaking out a bit. A LOT of people showed up and I became even more nervous. But after I saw people around my own age who looked just like you or me I sort of calmed down. They were really friendly and some of them saw that I was new and helped me around. Not everyone had the time to talk since we were so many but I was fine just listening aswell. I could relate so much for the first time I didn't feel like the youngest there or that I "stood out" somehow. Many of them were new to sobrierity or had had recent relapses like me..I exchanged numbers with two people who wanted to have a coffee sometime..A lot of my friends I only hung out with when I was drinking so now that I don't I can feel a bit lonely so this was a great experience. After the meeting I was invited to join some from the group to go to an Indian restaurant to eat which we did. So all in all: great evening definitely going back again!

Very cool!  The YPAA movements are what I've been telling lots of newcomers about over the last year.  Of course there are sober activities and sober young people.  
Awesome!!!
