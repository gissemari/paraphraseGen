Last night I found myself up way past my sober bedtime. I think it was the combination of too much coffee and internet shopping but 3am hit and I finally forced myself to at least turn out the lights. I awoke at 8ish to use the loo feeling horrible. I was anxious nauseous disoriented cranky dehydrated and had a headache. OMFG did I drink last night?! Nope. Turns out this is also how I feel when I'm just sleep- deprived not drunk-sleep-deprived. What a reminder though it felt so much like a real hangover. Strange as it might sound if I'm really feeling the urge to drink again I think I'll just induce this hangover-look-alike as a reminder. Til then I won't be drinking with all of you today!

Haha I always say my tolerance for pain really decreased since I've gotten sober. I used to go to work every single day no matter how horrific the hangover. Now I wake up a little tired and headache-y and I'm like OMG I'm dying. ..I cannot believe the pain and suffering I used to put my body through and put UP with. Sobriety truly is the softer way...Loved this thanks.
Sometimes I wake up and used to blame some of how I feel on alcohol. But I think it's just getting old. Lol. 
I long for a decent nights rest.  I won't drink with you today.
Haha this is hilarious I went out a few days ago sober driving until 2am with some friends and I felt wrecked the next morning. I hate to think how much worse it would have been if I was hungover on top if that!
So true. It's really difficult to get a full good nights rest when your sleep cycle is messed up by booze. Thanks for the reminder!
