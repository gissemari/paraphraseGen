You're hitting the eyewall of this hurricane. Won't last forever...Saw you username  and tried to use some Florida storm analogy.
Just make it to tomorrow and you won't regret it. Good luck.
Remember that this is a feeling that will pass.  It helps me to ice cream or drink a Canada Dry ginger ale.  You got this!  It will get better.  IWNDWYT
Yes the first few days are tough.  Like boot camp.  Then it gets better.
You've got this. It'll pass and you'll have stayed strong!
Hey Florkeyr you're doing great..I let irritation come and go cravings come and go..Tomorrow will come tomorrow no matter what we choose..I'm going to bed sober tonight. We are with you
