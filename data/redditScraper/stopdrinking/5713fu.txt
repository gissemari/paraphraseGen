I just came to realize  that in the last two years I've constantly tried to stop drinking. The most I managed to do was for about two whole months but every time an important event or trip with my friends came up I relapsed because I feared to miss out on something...It's hard to look back on a longer period of time but even this shorter two year period gives me a lot to think about since I was able to count almost every single day that I drank and that I did not. ..-I've had tenths of 7-10 day periods I managed to stay sober and then I blew..-I've probably spent well over 10k on alcohol and other reckless decisions related to that..-I attempted to hurt myself twice and I endangered the people I love several times by driving drunk or really hungover..-I've further damaged my stomach health situation and it keeps getting worse I have a lot of heartburn ulcers and what not.. .On the other hand I've also gained a lot of experience from all these mistakes and that I do not regret. I came to realize that most people around me are not aware that they have a drinking or substance problem and there's nothing I can do about it it's their decision to quit and all I can do is be an example...Maybe this 11 day period will be just another one like the other tenths in the last years or maybe it will actually be the last time and I will be able to look back at the 1st of October next year as my sober anniversary. I have a feeling this will be a long one! There is a lot of time left until the end of the year holidays and by that time I will be so sober I won't even care about all the drunkness that is going on around me!..I wish you all in this subreddit a lot of luck and strength!

Sounds like you've got lots of experience. I know the best thing for me in finding SD here has been learning strategies and tactics to get me through when things get tough. This isn't the first time I've tried sobriety but those other times I was just out on my own with no support or strategies...Congrats on 11 days!
My pattern of getting 1-2 weeks sober over and over again is very similar to yours.  I have a good feeling about this streak also!
