Just wanted to share with anyone struggling lately that it does indeed get easier. A month ago I would have broken in an instance. I am accepting life as it is without any substance altering my mind. It's not always fun but I feel like this is what being an adult is all about. Accepting life as it is and doing your best to change the parts you don't like. What I call "Raw life" can suck some times because you have to endure the crappy parts but you're 100% mindful and there for the good parts (and will actually remember them)...&amp;#x200B;..Hope you all have a great safe and sober weekend.
