Not that I'm glad that other people have relapsed...But being able to read their stories about it...  that yes it was as bad as all of that.  That they wished they hadn't tossed away X days/weeks/months/years of sobriety.  That they're in some ways glad that they learned from it...In the past couple of days since I got my one month mark the lizard part of my brain keeps trying to convince me that "I'm OK; you beat this! Maybe a drink or two wouldn't be so bad!"..I mean...  at this point for me it's not a physical craving.  It's hardly a social one.  It's just that nagging "why can't I do this thing that I used to be able to that so many others can?"..Those posts by all who've gone befits me remind me if what I already know: ..It *would* be that bad.  I *can't* do it and r the people who can? Maybe they have their own struggles that they were hiding as well as I was hiding mine...But the stupid part of my brain is right in one respect:..I *am* OK.  But I'm OK because I *quit* drinking not that I'm OK to *start* drinking....

I love this thank you for posting. Your last line reminds me of a roommate I used to have who was bipolar. She would take her medication and start feeling better and then think she wasn't bipolar anymore and then stop taking it. Guess what happened? ..Same thing. We stop drinking think we're fine and then relapse. But we weren't better we were still alcoholics all along and the cure was not drinking. Just like my roommate's bipolar meds. 
This is a great post. And it super helpful as well in addition to the relapse posts. Thank you you put it really well. 
&gt;why can't I do this thing that I used to be able to **that so many others can?**..I've been thinking about the "others" aspect of this a lot. A friend of mine is in town and wants to get together. I have relapsed many times in social situations. Sometimes because I wanted to fit in and sometimes because I get very tense in social situations. Most interpersonal interactions aside from brief or structured settings are tough for me...What I've noticed though is that after a couple of beers in those social situations I tend to want to get a bottle and hole up by myself anyway. Even if there were people interested in drinking like I do I probably wouldn't want them around once I get 6 or 8 drinks in me...If there are others who *can*  do what I *used to be able to do* they are **not** on billboards **not** laughing at the bar **not** looking glamorous with a glass of champagne and **not** asking for a scotch neat in a dark paneled gentlemen's club...There is no one who *can*  do what I *used to be able to do*. Only people who *have* to do what I *used to have to do*.
Honestly they are the posts I gravitate towards when I'm craving a drink...  .There don't seem to be many "I relapsed and it was fucking awesome!" posts out there...&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;
