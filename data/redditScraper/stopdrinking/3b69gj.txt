I had a relapse the weekend after my b/day but funny enough I did not enjoy it and came out the other side feeling stronger also I am more busy now than I was before I stopped drinking. here's to the future.

Good luck to you! Glad it helped you feel stronger!
I am grateful you're accepting life on life's tea. You're regretful but not dismayed or disgusted ( probably synonyms)
