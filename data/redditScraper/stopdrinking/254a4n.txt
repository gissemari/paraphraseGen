Now that a casual beer is out of the question when my mind occasionally drifts off to boozeville I find myself fantasizing about just downing vodka. Makes me think that if I ever relapse it's going to be in a big way. I guess I better make sure I don't relapse huh?

Oh yes. There's only one way... forward. In fact it seems like your subconscious knows that too. What ever imaginary drinking past we cling to is not a true representation of what a drinking future would bring us.  
Cunning baffling &amp; powerful--I get help for this sort of thinking.
yeah  it is waiting with a big stick.
Yep good call...I have gotten into making somewhat-complicated limeades. These require that I go to the store for "good ice." And things along those lines. It's gotten to where as I'm putting my daughter down for the night I find myself thinking forward to going into the kitchen and fixing myself whatever concoction I have planned for the night. I get my water extra bubbly juice up my own limes... I know it's working because i even found myself craving a fresh limeade at mile 11 of my recent half marathon much like I used to crave a post-race beer..
I have the same thoughts and was about to post this exact topic today. When I let my mind drift to drunk-land I have visions of just getting obliterated as quickly as possible. Luckily thinking of letting down myself my family and my friends immediately snaps me back into reality.
