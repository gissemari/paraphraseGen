Hi all!  I have to make my post quick today since I have to run off to work.  So grammar and thorough editing be damned!  I just wanted to share how my first day back to work was yesterday as I talked about in my last post.  Well...it went extremely well.  I have never felt more prepared to return to life from a drinking episode.  Normally I would have drank to cope with the shame and embarrassment of a public binge especially if I had to see anyone that had witnessed this which was the case with work.  But having not been drinking for two days I felt much better equipped to handle it.  The support that I have had here is what really carried me through.  I really felt like I had a group of people standing behind me cheering the entire shift.  Then I read some more positive comments during break only reinforcing this feeling.  This type of support is what I had been yearning for all the countless days I lay in bed after drinking and being hungover.  Feeling like I had no one in the world and nowhere to go but down.  But now I have all of you and increasing tools coping skills and knowledge to confront with my drinking issue head-on...Some other little things I did yesterday that helped me get through day two 1. I treated myself to getting my hair washed and blown dry (is super long and thick) before work.  This reduced some of my stress of getting ready and I was relaxed by having my hair washed in cold water and being in the air conditioning.  I practiced a lot of mindfulness before during and after work.  The book I got it a great tool and I'll post the name and author tomorrow.  Lastly I literally took each minute as it came to me.  I put one foot in front of the other and coach myself through staying in the moment to get through it.  ie: "okay you are walking into the door at work" "okay now you are clocking in and counting your drawer"....this helped me immensely.  I was still feeling quite anxious but each minute I successfully got through the better I felt.  Oh one more thing I did was leave work during my break.  I went to get something tasty to each and called my boyfriend to chat.  It's weird how when you focus on caring for yourself you realize how little of it you had really done in the past..When I got home I made sleepy time tea and ate a bowel of cereal that was a mix of cinnamon toast crunch and lucky charms.  I felt like a rebel.  Also there was not enough cinnamon toast crunch for an entire bowel...Before going to bed I also looked at SD and was excited to see how many new people were posting on the site.  It strengthened even more my resolve and knowledge that I am not in this alone.  We can all do this together and I will not drink with you today!!!  I can't keep up with posting to everyone's posts but just know that I am thinking of you/..There are many inspiring quotes in my mindfulness book and will likely share a few with you.  Here is one that got me through my first day 1 when I relapsed by drinking 3 beers:.."If you're walking down the right path and you're willing to keep walking eventually you'll make progress" ~ President Obama..I hope every has a fantastic day and I love you all :)

Great post!  The road can be hard but I have found that when my courage is failing there are always people here to lend me some of theirs.  We never have to be alone as long as we are working to be or stay sober.  Welcome and thanks for posting!
Keep it up we're on day 5 now!!..What's the book you're reading?
