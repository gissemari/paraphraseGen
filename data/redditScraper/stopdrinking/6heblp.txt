I was full of hope even after slipping over the weekend. But I justified small amounts of alcohol and then last night went to excess again. ..I'd made it 48 days a record. One of my big motivations was and is believing that alcohol contributes to me getting depressed more than I need to. The trigger to this relapse was hitting a depression from day 20-something onward.  I think I need to just accept that I have a biochemical depression that is probably not going to completely go away even once I achieve long-term abstinence from alcohol. That way I won't have false hope about coming off of antidepressant meds and I won't attached "well I ought to just drink" to depressive episodes.  ..I think I can still avoid a prolonged relapse. It's back to just one day at a time thinking. Today will be hard. I want to do it though.  I want to not drink today.

Welcome back! I'm glad you are back! You can do it. You sorta have a know of why you drank in the first place that's awesome and helpful!
Do you work out regularly and eat healthy?  A lot of research indicates  that a healthy gut is critical to a happy mind because that is where most of the neurotransmitters are made.  Just an idea.  Welcome back.  I won't drink with you today.
I'm one day away from allowing myself a temporary slip and not sure how to feel about it. At least I'm not alone.
