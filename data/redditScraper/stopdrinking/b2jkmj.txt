27 days and 12 hours since I last had a drink. Really has gone by pretty fast. That last binge and the consequential withdrawal symptoms I dealt with for a week were enough to make me finally realize my body needed a break. I'm 22y/m and I've been a pretty heavy drinker since I was about 18. I used to buy 15-24 packs and a fifth and drink it with my roommate over the course of a day or two. Constantly neglecting my responsibilities weighed down my mental health and constantly drinking weighed down my physical health. I'm going to a concert June 15 and would love to have two more months of sobriety in by that point. Still need to fix my horrible sleep schedule and become more productive (should probably cool down with the pot) but I guess I just wanted to say it's easier than what it seems like and as someone who could hardly ever make it more than 3-5 days sober I'm so glad I'm doing this and making progress. I've relapsed so many times and fell straight back into it. I think I got the momentum to go for a long streak this time. Hope everyone has a good start to the week

Great work!  Keep up that momentum!
Little early to worry about June 15. Let's not drink today. Worry about tomorrow when the clock strikes midnight. 27 days is a great accomplishment. 1st month for me was the hardest.
