Well I made it the first 7 days. It's been hard when I'm lonely. Being lonely is the hardest part of this all. Being sober I've noticed that's why I drink because I'm depressed I guess. I haven't lost much weight I guess I've been eating more. I have been spending a good amount of the time in the gym though. ..We are all in this struggle together ..IWNDWYT

First congrats on making it 7 days that alone is a huge accomplishment. I'm on day 40 and my focus will be moving to getting back into shape but it took a good month just to clear my head and get my body used to be sober. For me the weight will come off in time getting my mind clear and my body adjusted is my first objective..
The loneliness is difficult to overcome. At least when you are drinking you don't think or feel anything.  I find the loneliness the single worst part about being sober.  Even more than cravings.  
Don't worry about the weight. I eat whatever I want for the first 2 weeks (been through this a few times) then I start eating healthier and less to lose the weight. 7 days is a big accomplishment good job!
I'm sorry you are going through it.  I am too. 
Yes we can!!!!!
