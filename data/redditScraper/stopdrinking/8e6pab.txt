I'm an alcoholic have been since I had my first drunk but I'm struggling with quitting heroin. 3 months sober this time around relapsed 5 times over the past year. But I have a funny story!..So as a person with a Substance Use Disorder I went to my cousin's party. Now this is the only party I've ever been to. Never been to a bar or a club as I'm only 21 and first started trying to get sober at 20. So I go to this party and I respectfully decline any and all drinks offered to me but settle for smoking pot as there is a ceiling and I won't black out and make a fool of myself/attempt suicide as drunk me is prone to doing. So I sit in my little corner people watching making idle conversation talking about how I don't drink as "I'm an alcoholic" I'm getting pats on the back and then politely excusing myself and shooting heroin in the bathroom! I wasn't doing a lot as I wasn't very deep into my addiction at that point but wow! To this day I'm amazed at the hypocrisy how I was able to bask in the praise of my fellow partiers and not feel a hint of remorse at the time. .Soon I'll be giving an amends for that I believe. But currently it's funny to laugh at!.Thanks for providing a space to reminisce I'm not about to share this "war story" with anyone besides Reddit.

Thanks for sharing - glad I am not alone in that particular "I'm an asshole addict" boat lol...Happy Sunday my friend and congrats on your 3 months!...[High Five](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg)
