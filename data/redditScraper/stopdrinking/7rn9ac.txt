I had just learned some good news at work and it hit me that I was going to go home and relax with some beers.  It was a massive craving.  It last about 30 seconds but I told myself  no damned way. ..I tried rationalizing that a few beers wouldn't hurt.  But I was able to realize that I wouldn't never have to rationalize why I could have a few Coca-Colas and I understood the insanity of the consumption of alcohol...My prayers out to all the brothers and sisters that are struggling much worse than me.  You can do this.

You can too.  Sober on!.
That first beer is opening the door for the worst ex you've ever dealt with!..A really good post here yesterday that metaphorically spoke about alcohol made me think of it this way.
