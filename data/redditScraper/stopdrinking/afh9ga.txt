After a long holiday vacation binge in Mexico with my friends and then an extended one week vacation at home where I was drinking basically the whole time I tried to taper without success I would always just get back to basically being drunk. The day I tried to stop I couldn't sleep a wink couldn't keep food or water down and had the shakes pretty badly. ..I went to the emergency room because of my fear about me repeatedly throwing up. There was no judgment no lectures honestly not a big deal. They hooked me up to an IV with fluids and electrolytes (because I was so dehydrated) gave me a warm blanket in a dark room gave me some Zofran for my nausea and some Ativan for the shakes and nervousness and turned on the tv for me. They sent me home with a prescription for a benzodiazepine that will last me the week to help with sleeping and anxiety. They did provide me with resources for help with alcoholism also. I left feeling pretty close to normal and after about a day I was back to being mostly myself (still some anxiety but I'm an anxious person in general). ..After my insurance it was about $200 for my two hour stay and probably the best $200 I've ever spent. Anyway I was really fearful about getting medical help to get through the detox and I put it off many times because of that fear. Hope this post is helpful to someone out there!
