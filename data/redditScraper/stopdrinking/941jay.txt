I've already told my therapist. We're taking about it. I'm talking with some close friends. But I don't want to be saved and I will not be hospitalized again. I just want to get rid of this thing that I never asked for...Here's the kicker: I've never been in a better place. Landed the job that I've wanted since high school. Got into the college that I've wanted to go to since high school (which was over four years ago now but still) I got my own house I've loved with all of my heart and received equal love in return I've traveled extensively on multiple occasions for multiple reasons. Seen the world. I've done the worst shit jobs on the planet (ever see Deadliest Catch?) and I've done some incredibly fulfilling work...And I haven't found anything that I want to hold on to. And that makes me hopeless...I just want someone to tell me it's okay. It's not selfish. It's not cowardly. It's not impulsive...I told myself I'd either get a gym membership or a gun but hell I'm already in good shape...I feel like I'm at the end of the line and I just want to go back to my old friend sink into oblivion and end it...Thanks for reading.

Sounds like you have led quite the adventure. You certainly seem like a guy(or gal) with a great story to tell. Why let one decision be the final scene. I've been where you are. I remember just a few months ago thinking about going out Hemmingway style that my great story ends here in a pile of brains and bourbon and self loathing. Thinking about how damn easy it would be. But what a fucked up ending. A terrible way to end a book. Judging by your post you seem like a person with a lot of grit. Keep on going I'd reccomend it. .Also fuck it get a gym membership and a gun both lovely hobbies that are very enjoyable. Sober. .And my badge is a lie
Oh no:(. I am so sorry that you feel like this...I've been where you are: having everything going for me and still suicidal. I've felt on and off like that since I was about 14 years old. I acted upon those feelings when I was 27 and again when I was 31. I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 27 have been in mental health institutions for prolonged stays (couple of months) twice. I am on several medications. ..My death wish changed from  constantly there' to  not caring/numbness' (and self destructing with alcohol) to  no death wish at all' now at 34. ..It took me 20 years to feel like I want to live and I don't know how long this will stay like this but I can genuinely say that I am currently happy to be alive. ..I don't think suicide is cowardly not at all. And I completely understand feeling that suicide is the best option not because of self-hate but because of self-*love* because it is so hard to keep on going when you are hurting so much. And when everything is perfect it might be even harder because you have nothing to look out for. That made me despair; that everything was already fine except my feelings...But what a shame it would be when you would give up and miss the light at the end of the tunnel miss the joy of life that might be there...Thank you for posting I really hope you stick around.
Please don't I am here for you.  I'm sad you're hurting like this. What can I do to help you?  Please be strong
Hey friend.  I'm sorry you're feeling shitty at the moment. ..I looked through your post history quickly : there were a lot of posts since you quit drinking which radiated hope and happiness. That made me wonder whether something had happened more recently that maybe had triggered this period of feeling hopeless? If there hasn't been a situational trigger and you feel so hopeless anyway without knowing why it may be time to speak to a doctor about it. There is so much help out there that doesn't require hospitalisation. ..Looking at how long you've been sober and all you've achieved it is clear that you are a talented kind resilient guy. A really good egg as we sometimes say here in England. I hope you can get the support to enable you to enjoy all your accomplishments and that you continue to achieve your dreams. ..Please don't throw in the towel yet. You have so much to offer the world. IWNDWYT 
Hi.I have had times when I wanted to drink and just die. I am in my 40's and only recently have I been put on the right combination of meds so that I feel good I feel normal. .I believe your life is worth fighting for. Don't give up hope..Hang in there. Hugs.
I'm sorry you are going through this. You recently posted about choosing not to drink some wine at your parents house. I was at my parents house that weekend (always a lot of drinking) and that post provided me with so much strength and perspective. Not drinking that day ended up benefiting a lot of people I love and your post played a huge part. I'm in no way saying it is your responsibility to keep anyone sober or that you owe anyone anything you don't but I thought it might be nice to hear how you being on this planet was the source of such positivity for a family. ..I've been in that awful place and I know it can feel hopeless. but I really think you deserve a better ending to your story (sorry for blatantly ripping off the previous poster...but he said it so well!) you definitely deserve it for the help you gave me and my family that day. ..Thank you for that post and I hope you keep fighting. 
I've never been where you are so I cannot truly understand. But I have had some dark moments in my life and what they all have in common is that one day they are behind you.   The hard times do pass. ..Killing yourself is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.  Please keep focusing on the positives and please keep seeking the support and help that you are. ..One day this will be behind you and you will take a strength from that.  
I cannot speak to the pain you are in.  I am so sorry to hear of it.  I have a good friend in my life who is struggling with depression and suicidal ideation right now and I see how hard it is.  One thing that helps him and one thing that helped me when I felt my lowest is animal companionship.  My dog relied on me loved me unconditionally and gave me so much that it gave me some purpose in life.  No matter what else was going on my freaking dog was always there and loved whatever I had to give.  I felt a positive obligation to him and it made my life easier.  I do so hope that you get the perspective you need to continue.  Sometimes just sitting with painful things long enough will allow them to dissipate and turn into something else.  I wish you all of the best.
My man--the game is so far from over.  ..If you quit drinking I'm sure there was a time you couldn't imagine NOT drinking.  I don't know how long you've been feeling this way but it sounds like you can't imagine NOT feeling this way...Think about that for a second...All it took was one day one second one moment--for everything to turn around and for you to enter a new world of possibility where you've lived for 267 days...The insane accomplishments you've already experienced in other areas of life are all evidence that **this** can change too...As long as you are alive and you are drawing breath there is still a chance to turn it around.  There is medication there are diet and lifestyle modifications there are new therapists and new kinds of therapy there are philosophical and existential frameworks there are new people you haven't met yet there are people you haven't HELPED yet.  ..Fuck it there is just TIME for this darkness to pass.  I look back on some dark times in my life where all I wanted was for all of it to end.  I look back at those times totally flabbergasted--like they belonged to someone else to some other world. ..Keep fighting.  Your life is not your own.  There are other people out there who need YOU...Take this one day at a time.  You beat booze and you can beat this too...Keep fighting.  Just for TODAY: Do not give up.  ..Then get the fuck up and do it again tomorrow...I will not drink with you today and I will live with you today...Lots of love to you.  Big heart vibes.
Dang! I'm sorry you are feeling so sh*tty.  Did therapist wanna treat your mood or no?
It's called recovery for a reason. It took me a whole lot of feelings to level out and figure out what I was really about. I've only just recently seen an AA saying "time tales time" that has some current meaning to me even after 2.5 years sober. I got sober so that I could release myself from being compromised by alcohol and fulfill my destiny. I'm figuring out what that is one day at a time. Best wishes. 
  
Please get a second therapist that specializes in group therapy.  That truely helped me.  Your life sounds like mine.  It is exhausting dealing with depression every single day when you wake up.  I have considered suicide my whole life.  I have even considered shock therapy.  .Two things other than my precious family that have really helped me are my pug and volunteering at our local homeless shelter.  The pug makes me laugh all the time in spite of myself with his antics and my friends I see every week at the shelter whom I love and respect and am so thankful to be able to serve...Please... give yourself more time and consideration.  You may be the only difference in another's life.  I hope for you that you can "rise above the fray" and find some semblance of peace and contentment for which so many of us struggle to attain.  My friend I hope you choose to live.   
We're all here for you man. Please don't give up. We need you here. Try another day please. Just keep going.
***The Myth of Sisyphus*** is a 1942 philosophical essay by [Albert Camus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus). ..In the essay Camus introduces his philosophy of the absurd  man's futile search for meaning unity and clarity in the face of an unintelligible world devoid of God and eternal truths or values. Does the realization of the absurd require suicide? Camus answers "No. It requires revolt." He then outlines several approaches to the absurd life. The final chapter compares the absurdity of man's life with the situation of [Sisyphus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus) a figure of [Greek mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology) who was condemned to repeat forever the same meaningless task of pushing a boulder up a mountain only to see it roll down again. The essay concludes "The struggle itself \[...\] is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy".
