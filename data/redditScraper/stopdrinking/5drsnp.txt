I said that to myself over and over about a year ago in a hospital bed with blood all over my legs. Cuts so deep they could've been the death of me. So drunk I was barely conscious feeling tremors going in and out of me and panic setting over myself. But I knew it was time for a change. Time to stop letting my demons fuck me I was gonna fuck over my demons...Here I stand today with an amazing girlfriend a new job that is looking like it could lead to a means for a family and amazing friendships that don't revolve around alcohol. Friends that would die for me. People that truly love me. And decent relationships with my family. I'm seeing the brighter picture unfold and I just want to let people know it does get better. I have my bad days I have my good ones. Mostly life is just okay. But I am not drunk I am far from it and I know I never want to live that life again. Day by day. I relapsed somewhat through this journey but I got back up again and just am now getting closer to 9 months of sobriety. It feels amazing...Thank you everyone for your support and I love you guys.
