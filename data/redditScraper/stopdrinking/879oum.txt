Yup. Did the relapse thing. I spent two weeks sober. Slowly built back up from a promise to my self that "I'll drink in moderation" or "only with meals"...that became... "Well no harm in a bottle Friday night"...Saturday night... and then hokay... About 9 glasses of wine last night hiding it all from the wife. ..My goal. Stay sober today. That's it. Just one day. Tomorrow can be dealt with romorrow...I will not drink with you all today.

yeah I've learned that drunk me stops remembering how much has been consumed and just keeps making excuses to have just one more. Stay strong today
One day. You got this. I won't drink either. I'll make a choice about tomorrow when it gets here. 
I drink wine like I'm chugging a beer. It's kinda ridiculous. Put down a bottle in an hour like it's nothing. Feel lost a lot of the time. One day at a time
