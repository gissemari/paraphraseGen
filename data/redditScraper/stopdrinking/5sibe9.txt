I drank over the weekend. My partner was out of town and I knew I couldn't bother him with my drinking if he wasn't there. There was no next-day regret no hangover it really was a blast--but I know how it will end if I keep drinking so I'm getting back on the horse...I stopped caring about the steps. It's hard to do the third step prayer every morning when you don't truly believe in a higher power. I don't think my sponsor is particularly pleased with me at the moment not that I can blame them. I'm not pleased with myself. I just don't know whether to continue with AA or try something like the SMART program. AA has not been clicking with me anymore but I don't want to just dump my sponsor...tl;dr I drank last weekend been feeling pretty disconnected from AA lately thinking of SMART recovery instead not drinking with you today.

&gt; My friend suggested what then seemed a novel idea. He said * Why don't you choose your own conception of God? * (p12)..The god and Higher Power thing was tough for me too. But I had to just accept that I could not stay sober on my own. Therefore there must be a power greater than me which would help me stay sober. Maybe that power is "accountability" or "a sponsor" or "an AA meeting" or your own conception of a mythical all knowing god...For me my higher power is whatever I decided to make it. I literally "designed" my own concept of a higher power. [Check it out.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cx4f0295ih6uan4/Ed%20AA%20-%20Higher%20Power.pdf?dl=0) The image I found online but the text is completely my own. Maybe it would help you to go through a similar exercise...Once I decided what my higher power was it was easy to take Step 3 because I decided what it was. Start small and simple - maybe it's nature or the universe. Whatever it is just know that if you take yourself out of the way maybe you can see how a power greater than yourself could restore you to sanity...Above all else I will not drink with you today.
There are plenty of agnostics who got sober in AA and plenty of AA meetings for agnostics that share your disbelief.  That should not be an impediment to getting sober if you want to.
My first sponsor made it very simple for me. He said 'You turn your will over to your higher power by doing the rest of the steps. If you've truly made a decision then pick up a fucking pencil and start step four.' He was a no-nonsense guy who didn't give a shit whether I believed in God. He convinced me that what really mattered was what actions I was willing to take.
