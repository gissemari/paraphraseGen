Afternoon all. Just wanted to show some support for people in early recovery who may be relapsing weekly and can't see a way out. I was the same. Relapsing every weekend sometimes three times four times a week. I couldn't see any light at the end of the tunnel but one day I admitted I was powerless over alcohol and that my life was unmanageable with alcohol in it. From the day forward it was a light bulb moment and I've done everything in my power to rid my life of alcohol. It's hard you'll make tough decisions lose drinking buddies get called boring by people who have no understanding of addiction but fuck them all it is 100% worth it. Keep on fighting if I can do it YOU CAN TOO!!!
