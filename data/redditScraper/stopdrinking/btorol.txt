Im sober and grateful for that but I just feel shit I am struggling with the point of being sober if this is how I am going to feel all of the time then whats the fucking point.  ..And now as I am writing this and I know I am chomping on a pity dick and its just a low couple of days that wont last it gets better.  ..But fucks sake I am feeling shit.  ..I just want a sign that its gonna be ok.

If I told you how much better my life is now you might not believe me. It's like two completely different lives. It got better for me and I'm willing to say I'm sure it will get better for you...Hang in there! It is sooooo worth it!
I'm with ya dude.  I'm literally at the point where I am sleeping just to pass time because I'm *that* bored and lonely.  I understand that you have to build a life that you'll enjoy but it seems like my capacity to enjoy is pretty diminished and I think it's more than a case of PAWS. I'm kind of worried that I'm going to crack soon.
Those first few days weeks months can be grueling. It's like a cumulative hangover. It gets better. Everyone here will tell you that. It's hard to notice day to day but as you get through more those little improvements add up. You can do it. You were strong enough to start sobriety and that strength is still there.  IWNDWYT
