Woke up today feeling really damn good. I made it to the gym yesterday did a full 10 hours of work (I work for myself from home) and ended up cooking a great dinner and watching a movie with my GF. Didn't have a single urge to drink and this morning was bliss. I actually woke up and had to remind myself that there was nothing to worry about because I didn't have a drink last night and therefore there was no risk of me doing anything stupid or blowing loads of cash etc. ..Feeling strong today just checking in for accountability. I know I will struggle more as the weekend approaches but 24 hours at a time right?..Hope you're all doing well.
