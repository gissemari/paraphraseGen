Is there a meeting you can go to? I hope you pull through. You are better than this 
I'm sorry you're struggling. As outlined in the community guidelines we ask that you only post when you have not been drinking. For this reason we had to remove your post. But we'll be here tomorrow if you want to come back then. In the meantime you might want to try calling the National Alcohol Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357)...
