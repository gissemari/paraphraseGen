Hey Sobernauts! It's Hump Day! What's up?..---..**Triumph**: I was struggling to complete a technically challenging task at work. I decided to involve someone more experienced and qualified than I turns out they can't solve it either so we're going to do it another way!..**Struggle**: I've a funeral to attend alcohol took them too young. It'll be a dry wake which helps. I'm trying not to be tormented by the thought "*I could have done more*" accepting that I can't change anything that's happened and I can't choose recovery for someone else. I'm reminded how alcohol robbed both of us of life - from being present in our own from sharing in the lives of our loved ones and ultimately risking a foreshortening of life. I'm very grateful to have escaped...**General Chat**: Decorating at the moment it's nice to get a fresh coat of paint! This would not have got done whilst I was still drinking. What house tasks are you facing this week?..---..Service opportunity: If you'd like to get involved with hosting What's up Wednesday post below with the word "camel" in your post so I don't miss it or drop us a modmail :)
----------immediate responses--------

Thanks for this finally_woken. Sorry for your loss. ..Triumph: I survived the visit of my alcoholic friend and in addition to not drinking I'm also nearly 30 days into non smoking!..Struggle: I received notification from an old housemate that I'd been receiving bills for the past year and the fees had racked up to $10000! :'(...General chat: Feeling ok coping with stress with extra sleep woke up today feeling much more capable as a human after 12 hours of sleep instead of drained and defeated as I would have if I was drinking. ..Absolutely love this subreddit couldn't have made it this far without y'all. :) &lt;3 
So sorry for your loss  OP. Thoughts and prayers are with you. PM if you need the ear of an interweb stranger. ..Triumph: This is day two and I feel amazing.  Planning on running again this evening and maybe wrestling my kids for the first time in a really long time. I'm just focusing on how good I feel.  I've moved more this morning than I have any morning in years. ..Struggle: I've felt this way before.  This is my umpteenth second day. The longest break was 30+days 2 years ago.  I know the call for that drink waits just around the corner.  However  unlike when I quit smoking  there's no craving...yet. ..Chat: I really do feel incredible.  Happy  content optimistic etc. I just need to remember this feeling versus the sluggish clouded apathetic drunk. Not drinking with you today  OP! Hold Fast! 
**Triumph:** I've been slammed at work. Two years ago I would have been drinking to "relieve" the stress. I would be trying to keep it to only drink a few beers and less than 400 mL of gin each evening. Now I've been relieving the stress with yoga naps and running...**Struggle:** Stress is definitely a factor that increases cravings and depression. I've noticed some of my warning signs and need to double-down on my self-care...**Chat:** Looks like I've got leaking toilets. Those are suddenly on my to-do list :(
Triumph: woke up early even though I went to bed way too late. Still feel so much more alive than if I had passed out drunk earlier in the night...Struggle: feeling demotivated and unsure of which direction I want to go in life. I just went bankrupt and have a fresh start but it's hard to figure out where to go and how to get there...Chat: I can't wait to pick up this book I've been reading and continue the story. I'm 600 pages into 1000 pages and I'm going to be sad when it ends :(. 
Sorry for your loss...**Triumph:** I did my last bit of lab work met my (possible) longer term therapist and tried a different AA meeting yesterday. Also have successfully had it through 5 days of working out/nutrition plan...**Struggle:** I may have kicked drinking but now I am slowly replacing it with smoking (eww &gt;.&lt;). Not exactly the clean lifestyle I am aiming for. Also my clinic therapist appointment got canceled due to snow and it has been hell trying to reschedule I feel weird calling everyday - but she referred me to my long term therapist and I am not sure its a great fit and I wanna get that meeting I paid for. &amp;&amp; trying to figure out a way to talk to my husband again on sharing responsibilities around the house with reacting poorly. Too many broken promises and when the house gets overwhelming it hits a trigger. I need him to understand that and help instead of thinking I am just being a bitch...**General Chat:** I have leaking sink in the kitchen vent over the stove need to be screwed in better and work on art projects to hang on my walls...Thanks for posting this. Sorry I ranted a bit and thank you from bringing up house stuff!
I'm all in!
TRIUMPH: Successfully completed my first semester of grad school last month and just got an email yesterday inviting me to apply to and honor society due to my 4.0 GPA and found out this morning that I was accepted!  ..STRUGGLE: Husband was injured at work 10 weeks ago and been home since then found out yesterday he had to have surgery on the 22nd of Feb.  Finances are tight right now and we are both stressed. Such is life. ..CHAT: I've got the coolest little kid in the world.  My baby has turned into a lil toddler over night!
I'm sorry to hear of your loss...Triumph: made it through an extremely hard day at work and breaking up with my girlfriend without a drink or junk food to cope. ..Struggle: work is very stressful and energy consuming. I need to find a new job but all I want to do is avoid thinking about it when I'm off work...Chat: I need to slow down and finish what I start. So many unfinished projects and books!
Triumph : In general kicking ass. So productive.  .Struggles. Always money. Bills are so behind.  .General : Starting to be able to see myself as a sober person.  Feeling a deep understanding of how important it is to see who I am without alcohol . Thanks /SD.
**Triumph**: I consciously realized this weekend that I don't even think about drinking anymore. It seems like in the early-goings I was patting myself on the back for getting through a weekend without drinking--happy to better capitalize on my free time. Now that it's the norm I'm holding myself to a much higher standard. ..**Struggle:** Twilight Struggle. I know it's not the point of this thread but I'm in the middle of a game of Twilight Struggle (one of the best strategy games of all time) with my roommate. We finished the Early War on Monday and are looking to finish the rest tonight. Board gaming has been an outlet for me since quitting and this game rules. It's our first full game playing and while it looks like [he's kicking my butt](http://imgur.com/ch90Mb5.png) the early war favors the soviets anyway and I have some tricks up my sleeve. I really wish that pesky Fidel Castro didn't give him such an easy road in Central America. He's right on my doorstep. I'm dominating the Middle East though. Go America. ..**General Chat**: Please see above. 
I'm sorry for your loss :(..I've lurked this sub for years and decided spur of the moment last week to actually give sobriety a try. So far so good. I've been more productive this week than in the whole of last month...**Triumph:** Yesterday I finally paid off my student loans. I've been following Dave Ramseys debt plan for the last year and this was my final payment. Normally I would have celebrated by going out and getting shitfaced instead I came home and worked on a passion project for a while read for a bit and then went to bed. I feel so adult. ..**Struggle:** Since this is so new I haven't really told anyone what I'm doing. Some of my dear friends/drinking buddies have invited me over on friday night to play cards and hang out. If I go over there I will drink. I haven't answered their invite yet I'm not sure what to say. Any advice?..**General Chat**: I spent hours covering all my windows in plastic to keep the place insulated this winter and my kitten has systematically gone and poked holes in all of them. I can't have anything nice. 
**Triumph:** Day after day seems to work for me. No longer living in any kind of illusion. I'm a full blown alcoholic.  ..**Struggle:** Some issues with my SO. Been together for 3 years but she's more an *enabler for my sobriety* meaning I like to spend time with her (as a good friend maybe?) and nothing more. I don't know how to get out of this situation without risking to relapse.  ..**General chat:** Flying to the US (I'm from Germany) the upcoming weeks. My last trip from Philly to Germany was a mess I was full blown drunk due to delay. 
**Triumph:** I was so fearful of going to meetings but now I feel at peace (especially with meditation). I am searching and applying for jobs and at least have time to take care of myself. ..**Struggle:** Totally thought I had 180 days tomorrow. Turns out it's Friday. I am bad at mathematics. ..**General Chat:** I do have some laundry to do but that will take an hour or so. Otherwise cleaning up here and there and everywhere. ..---..Service Opportunity: Camel camel camel camel camel camel camel mate. /u/finally_woken camel camel camel camel. Is that enough camels for you camel. 
Sorry to hear that dude...Triumph: didn't drink yesterday finally catching up on gaming..Struggle: my boss may literally be starting alzheimers as his memory is getting worse and worse and it is making him irate.  Fortunately I have very little invested and am actively seeking my teaching certification..General: my brother visits this weekend for my bday and though I am not going to drink I am gonna do my best to have a great time catching up!
Triumph: .I am slowly getting everything back that I lost to alcohol (and drugs). I will be driving again this week after a year of having a suspended license!..Stuggle:.I am worried about money as always. I am also dealing with some loneliness in sobriety. I have made an absolutely great sober friend but I have a hard time connecting with other people in AA. ..General Chat:.I'm slowly getting back into playing music I have been making noise and power electronics and I just might break out my drum kit soon!
**Triumph:** I've gotten back to writing at work this week. My job is to write extremely long profile pieces and since before the holidays I've been unable to focus long enough to produce one of them. Last night I stayed up till 2 just to battle this first one out. It's probably not the best thing I've ever written but I stuck with it. I know it will get easier...**Struggle:** Last week I was completely rejected by a very handsome man who started out really really passionate about me 4 months ago. I can't help but think that once he got to know me he lost interest. The fact of the matter was I never got comfortable with him because I'm not comfortable with myself right now. And that's okay. Being here is helping...**General Chat:** I woke up today and realized how lovely my little studio apartment is. Usually it's super junked up and smells like old takeout. No longer!
**Triumph:** Finally admitted that I may have a drinking problem and posted about it here. ..**Struggle:** Last semester of college lot of schoolwork on my plate. 25-50 page thesis. And tonight might be the last time I see my GF before she returns to South Korea. Idk when I'll see her again. ..**Chat:** Going blind into two quizzes today!
I'm so sorry about your friend - you're in my thoughts today. your message reminds me to stay grateful...**Triumph:** I exercised! like... on a real elliptical! and it actually felt good!!! important note: I've always been a scrawny skin-n-bones type who gets winded walking up a flight of stairs. I'm tired of feeling weak. the gym was a huge accomplishment and I hope the beginning of a stronger me...**Struggle:** a new-ish friend asked me out for a beer I opened up about my sobriety he poked fun at me. even said "I mean you can join me and *not* get wasted you know?" I think it was a defense mechanism because he felt awkward but it still hurt. realizing that some people really just don't get it. ..**General Chat:** I love interacting with this community every day. it feels like my lifeline sometimes. thank you all for being so awesome.
Triumph: Yesterday I was honest with my therapist and my parents about my recent relapse. I feel so much love and support. ..Struggle: I'm having problems with my SO. Not sure if we will continue our relationship. Regardless of the outcome I will not drink over it. ..General Chat: The shame of relapsing is starting to be replaced by relief and hope.
* Triumph: I'm still in school...* Struggles: I'm unemployed. I don't have insurance. I need cavity's filled and wisdom teeth removed. I'm enjoying each day less than the one before it...* General Chat: Waiting for my next class to start. Desperately hoping I hear back from a potential employer that pays more than minimum wage. Hoping I place well on police tests.  
Sorry for your loss OP. Thanks for the post. ..Triumph: I applied for graduation this spring to get my bachelors degree. I also sit for the LSAT on February 6th to apply to law school. ..Struggle: a little behind on some bills so I'm going to have to set a budget to get those back on track. Also working on day 4 so I'm still struggling with some withdrawls (anxiety nausea some auditory hallucinations) but one foot infront of the other mind as well keep moving at this point. ..Chat: Man am I sick of being cold and shoveling snow. Bring on summer time! 
Triumph: Today is my 10th day sober (I'm not drinking tonight so I'm counting it!) I've saved over $80 ingested over 3000 less calories than normal and I feel great! ..Struggle: Work related social anxiety has been kinda bad and a bad memory from a bad time has reared its head all this week and I wish I could kill it dead forever. ..General Chat: The SO has tried to fix our basement toilet to varying degrees of success these past 4 years. I'm thinking it's finally time to take the plunge (!!!) and buy a new toilet but I have to convince him to throw up the white flag first. I also need to weather proof our French doors. Houses are great!
Triumph: got my first review at the new job and got a perfect score. Apparently I'm kicking ass. I'm really getting into the flow here and starting to pull my own weight. Also I think I'm inspiring some of my new coworkers to start riding their bikes to work. I started feeling myself getting depressed a little bit back but I think I managed to pull myself out of it. Just trying to find ways to stay busy. ..Struggle: this weather. Midwest winters are so goddamn depressing. Everyone I know is struggling with something right now and I know there's nothing I can do about that but be there for them which sobriety is helping immensely. Like I said I just need to keep busy. ..General Chat: i've been itching to learn a new instrument recently and the universe totally answered. My grandma gave me her father's old mandolin. It's not in the best shape and I have to constantly tune it but its definitely something to start with not to mention a pretty cool family heirloom. Already learned some chords and some scales should be strumming along in no time. 
Congratulations on realizing that even the little things (new paint) that happen when we're sober are important...Triumph: I told my best friend I wouldn't be beer tasting this weekend even though she's visiting for my birthday.  She was happy for me...Struggle: My ex-husband took responsibility for an outstanding debt in our divorce agreement and I found out today that he hasn't paid it.  The IRS is planning to freeze our bank accounts if it is not paid in a week and I don't know how to make him pay it...Chat: I went to a relaxation yoga class tonight.  I would have had wine if I wasn't sober.  I think I'll feel better about the yoga decision than I would about drinking in the morning.
Triumph: Over 600 days sober still can't believe it. ..Struggle: My step-mother planned a family activity night that is centered around drinking. I'm just kind of miffed because she's been texting me about my presence being expected. I plan to show up with some Coca Cola in fancy glass bottles and act like everything is fine but I absolutely hate being locked in a room with my family when they're all drinking. ..General Chat: I've got a solid two months to play guitar loudly at my mother's house while she's on vacation in Arizona! We're setting up my brother's drum set there Friday night. Just what I needed!
