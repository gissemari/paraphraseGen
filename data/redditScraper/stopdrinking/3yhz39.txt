Dust cannot gather..If there is no mirror there...**My Take:**.Little bit of a followup on yesterday's "Purity".  Some think of the soul as a mirror and in order to keep it pure I have to keep it dust free.  ..Living in this world good luck with that.  ..Better for me to think of my soul as a part of me not some separate entity.  Now I also have to think of myself as one with all things.  Dissolve myself and therefore my soul into the world around me.  When I am one with the world I will find peace...I was struggling to figure out what the heck "Emptiness" had to do with this.  The best I could come up with is that it's the theory that your soul is a separate mirror is "empty".....or in other words BS.

My first thought about a mirror has to do with vanity : think "mirror mirror on the wall" and the evil step mother... Maybe it's saying when i get too caught up in appearances and how things look on the outside I miss the actual experience or percieving reality as it is I'm just looking at a false image of myself??..Must go back to slepp!..Thank you for the post!
Could this be one of those "If a tree falls in the forest" problems? I'm so tired but I can't stop thinking about this.
For me I see the issue of pride and ego--as hard as this is for me my sober path is easiest when I leave my vanity along the side of the road.
I like your take /u/Batman_2099  if I don't focus on myself I can't gather dust. Dust settles on the immovable do I want to live a life not moving?
