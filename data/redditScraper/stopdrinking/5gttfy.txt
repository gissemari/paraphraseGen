It's been 9 days without drinking. Which feels holy shit... It's difficult but it's amazing. Despite this being a huge accomplishment for me I've made the conscious decision to withhold this information from the people closest to me. ...I can't pinpoint the exact reason. Maybe I can. I'm going to try to figure it out while writing this with you guys RIGHT NOW. ..In past "sobrieties" I would be sober for about 2 days. In an effort to maintain my sobriety I would climb to the tallest mountain and puff up my chest. I would look my family and friends in the eyes and exclaim with the upmost confidence that I've decided to stop drinking...**Their responses:**..."Yup we've heard this one before. *background laughing*"..."You're going to drink tonight when you're not hungover anymore" (can't argue with this as it was typically the case)..."Is this like the time you went vegan for a week?"..."You're not an alcoholic."...Looking back now I think I can chalk these responses up to a few things. First of all I don't think they knew the full extent to my drinking. I don't think I can demonize them for it. Honestly I've never talked at all about drinking as a problem. Also how was I supposed to be honest with the people closest to me when I wasn't even honest with myself?...I didn't tell them about my suicidal thoughts when I was drunk. ...I didn't tell them that I couldn't stop after one drink. Probably because I didn't realize that other people could?! WHAT? HOW DO THEY DO THAT?...I didn't tell them that it was wrecking my mental state. ...I didn't tell them that I couldn't go to work because I was too hungover I told them I was sick. ...I didn't tell them about my crippling anxiety. ...Writing this out now I am realizing why I've been keeping my sobriety a secret. It's because I am not ready to share any of those struggles with them. In addition to that I am unprepared to deal with their unconscious responses. ...However I am prepared to open up in meetings. I am going to my third one in a row tonight and I was taken back at how understanding everyone is. I am prepared to open up to you folks on here. Lastly I am FINALLY prepared to open up to myself....I don't know when I will finally tell them. After writing this I realize that it is not important today. What is important is staying away from that first drink today I won't drink with you tonight. ...Thanks for reading. .Thanks for being

406 days sober and I still haven't explicitly discussed with my family but they know from observing my behavior. I've only told a few friends. I just tell my co-workers that I don't drink because they didn't know me before...I don't keep it secret but I also don't go around talking to people about it who aren't also in recovery.
I don't openly discuss my sobriety with others.  Only with others in recovery.  So many people are too judgemental or simply not helpful.  Some will even try to sabotage your efforts.  Once I have more sober time under my belt I hope to be able to effectively help others who struggle with alcohol.  But until I am more comfortable in my own sobriety I will keep it between me and the folks at meetings.  However  it would sure be nice to have a supportive group of friends and family to turn to for support.  That's where all the folks here come in.  I am so thankful for everyone here!!!..I will not drink with you today! 
I'm keeping it on a "need to know" basis - not everyone needs to know all my stuff.... My 2 best friends my mother my hubby... the people I know who will be supportive and helpful.
I never told anyone mainly because they aren't supportive at all including family.  I come here for support.  
The only two people (besides all of y'all!) who know I'm in recovery are my SO and my best friend. No one else really needs to know. I've mentioned to a few close friends that I've not been drinking lately but I don't tell them the extent of what that really means. I'm still very young so people refuse to take me seriously when I tell them I'm an alcoholic.
I've only told my husband and my psychologist. It's no one else's business. I do avoid situations and friends where I might struggle this early in my sobriety...Great introspection. I find this helps me a lot. I question my motives for drinking and try to dispute them. I've tried to sober up before and have decided that it's about me and not what others think. Looks like you're off to a great start!
Yes I've kept this goal a secret from most of my friends mainly because I'm ashamed of how out of control my drinking became and also because I don't want them to feel like they have to walk on eggshells around me.  Social situations aren't difficult anymore.  I've realized that most people don't care about what your drinking they just want to see that you are having a good time.  Good luck on your journey  
I may never tell anyone. As far as the people in my life know I get drunk with my family and friends on occasion. I mean that's what 23 year olds to right? They may notice when I stop getting drunk with them though. And if they question it I will simply tell them that I am trying to lose weight and cut the crap from my life. 
Don't feel compelled to share your goals with people 
I did not tell anybody. My direct family knows from my actions but I never said that I would stop drinking. Mainly because I don't want to commit to anything and let them down. I also don't know what to commit to: all I know is that I'm not going to drink today. That is not a big noteworthy commitment is it? 
When I was a drinker I was secretive about my life. Now I'm simply private.
I was vague about why I quit drinking and if they pressed me would say that I am medication for migraines that I can't drink on which is true but not the real reason I quit.  This time of year is hard and people already a little tipsy tend to want you to join in.  I came to the realization that it was up to me and what ever I felt comfortable doing was OK.  I only have one person (a work colleague) who regularly asks me if I'm still not drinking but he's a bit of a jerk anyways.  Most people now just accept that I'm not drinking for whatever the reason.  My sobriety is my journey not theirs and I am glad for it! 
Ahhhh I love this post. This resonates so much with me.  Happy 9 days by the way I'm right there with you!..I think I'm afraid to tell people I've quit drinking because I would be so disappointed in myself if I later have to admit to failure.  Plus admitting that I was at such a low point that sobriety was the only option would expose the extent of the problem. Both scary things...Although I've read that sharing your goals with those around you helps keep you accountable for now I'm satisfied doing this **just for me**.
Im with you on this. I do say Im not drinking to some Im close to but I keep it light. If they ask why I say I just got tired of it and dont like it much anymore. Ha.:-)( Really leaving alot out there.) I know that everything Ive ever been serious about in my life would seem to loose its power the more I talked about it. Talk is cheap. Plus kinda like you I fear peoples responses. This sub is the best place to be real. So I keep my truths here where its safe. Im glad your here too. Good post. On with our sober Tuesday!
Cant tell you how much I can relate. Especially the part about loved ones unintentionally cutting you down by bringing up times you have failed in the past.  There is nothing more frustrating and infuriating than that feeling in that moment. ..I am currently int he beginning phases of sobering up myself and I have to constantly stop myself from demonizing people close to me because I feel alone without their support. On the other side of that though which I feel like you were saying- I never let them in on how important this is to me...I'm happy for you that you are going to meetings. I haven't gotten to that point yet- my introverted brain won't let me accept it
