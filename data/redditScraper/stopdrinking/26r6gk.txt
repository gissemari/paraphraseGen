I'm a grad student and I'm taking exams this week and next so I felt like now would be as good a time as any to try and take a break to evaluate whether or not I feel like I have a problem. (For what it's worth though I can't remember the last time I had a break of more than a day in drinking. It's probably been at least a year.)..So far it hasn't been a tremendous struggle. I've not had any physical withdrawal symptoms I haven't had any irresistible cravings and I haven't really had any issues--but on the other side I haven't noticed any particularly miraculous or even noticeable transformation. I feel like I may actually be sleeping worse and I'm definitely more acutely aware of my boredom...I'm not going to give up just yet though...

Good on you! Schedule the boredom out. Early on for me Monday through Friday was easy because it was scheduled. Weekends were much more difficult so on Monday I would start a schedule for myself for the weekend I would finish that schedule by EOB Friday and stick to it.
