Yesterday I spent some time with my best friend... Often referred to as my partner in crime she and I have a long history of drinking together.  Drinking HEAVILY.  I didn't give her much detail on my decision to get sober...  She was busy preparing for a big birthday party for her husband so I really didn't think it was the right time to discuss all of it.  I basically just told her it's something I'm doing right now.  She was pretty supportive.  And I made it through the evening without drinking though literally EVERYONE in the house besides myself and the kids was doing jello shots drinking margaritas etc...  So tiny victory there.  I didn't love every minute of it but I was sure happy when I woke up this morning without a hangover and regret over acting like an idiot.  :)..Anyway I'll eventually have the chance to talk with her about it in further detail.  But it felt good to tell her just that little bit and I think that her reaction bodes well for later on the down the road.  She's much better at controlling her drinking and hasn't had the kind of issues I've had with it.  She has seen the impact it's had on my life and I think she will understand.  So... yeah not sure what the point of this is but I guess it just felt good to finally talk to someone other than my husband about what I'm doing...Then this morning I met up with a friend from work for a hike around a local lake.  I had mentioned earlier this week that I was forgoing Super Bowl activities based on my recent decision to quit drinking.  She asked me about it and I explained the gist of my issues over the past ten or so years...  And while it was somewhat nerve-wracking to put myself out there like that (this is the first time I've really hung out with this girl outside of work) I am so happy that I did.  She explained to me that she's struggled with almost the exact same problems I have and for almost the same exact amount of time.  The things she said made me think of things I said so many times over the years while I was trying to convince myself to clean up.  ..It was so nice to talk to someone who shares a similar problem!  She was very supportive of my decision and offered to be there for any kind of assistance needed.  And the best part is that I think our conversation may have helped her to start thinking more seriously about confronting her own issue.  So I told her I'd be there for support if and when she decides to go down this path.  ..So that's my weekend so far.  Almost two weeks in and feeling pretty good about this!  Thanks for reading this.  I realize I'm mostly just rambling but I just felt like sharing these small wins with some people who will understand just how great they really feel. ..I'm dropping my husband off at a Super Bowl party here soon.  He's very supportive and completely understanding of my decision to skip hanging out around all of our beer-loving friends today.  Instead I'm spending the day with my daughter watching movies and chipping away at some physics homework.  And to be honest I think it's going to be a fantastic way to spend my Sunday!  :)..Hope everyone out there is having a great day!  Loving this sub so much!  ..edit: typos!  typos everywhere!

Congratulations on almost two weeks.  You'll be there and beyond before you know it.  I'm skipping the super bowl.  Granted I ate a massive lunch at a mexican restaurant so I know if I have room for festivities even if I wanted to...It's great to have someone you can talk to about your experiences your present efforts and the opportunities ahead.
