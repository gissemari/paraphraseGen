I'm coming up on 7 weeks sober. Currently two days into vacation and am really struggling with cravings. It's hard to describe and maybe this isn't the right word for it but I miss the whole  being mischievous  aspect associated with drinking. I'm 30 years old now but so used to my early 20s when my friends and I would get drunk and let loose on weekends vacation etc. swapping stories about funny things we did while drunk. After being hospitalized and in a treatment program I know that drinking isn't fun for me anymore and that I can't moderate. I'm just having that voice in my head saying  you're on vacation you can have one  or  it's been 7 weeks you can have one .  First time really struggling with cravings since being sober.

You're doing the right thing by reaching out to folks here. One moment at a time. You've got this!
I definitely took some pleasure in hiding my drinking for the mischievous aspect.  It was fun to be getting away with something.  Guess I am just gonna have to find some new laws or rules to break.  
Kill that voice each day at the time. It will fade eventually. You are building your new you now.
The book This Naked Mind really helped me view alcohol differently. There is a pretty good podcast of the same name as well. A technique often talked about here is "play the tape forward" which I have found really helpful. Why waste a good vacation feeling sluggish grumpy and like crap in the morning? As for the mischief- instead of spending money at the bar- maybe find a zipline or a similar way to get your adrenaline going! You can get through this! Sober vacation is vacation you don't need a vacation from!
