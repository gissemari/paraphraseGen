Sounds like a fairly normal thing to do but beleive me I don't think I have ever been anywhere during the week apart from a pub...You know what? I really enjoyed myself. ..I got home late (for sober me) and thought ."Oh no I am going to struggle getting up in the morning.".But I didn't. Late nights don't equal a hangover or calling in sick when you go to bed sober...I hope everyone is having a fantastic Tuesday...IWNDWYT

I totally relate to that. I went and saw the first Avengers movie twice and both times I fell asleep :(.. hah..What movie did you see? Did you enjoy it?..The perks of sobriety are awesome! Happy to not drink with you today :)
Whoa this reminded me! I used to work as a critic and go to daytime movie screenings of obscure art films with beer in my pockets just to drink alone in the dark. Where I live that s illegal and cinemas can t sell or serve alcoholic beverages. OMG LOL and all that!! This would have been really funny it wasn t for the fact that just earlier this year I contemplated how I could bring booze to see Logan with my kid... I didn t and we enjoyed one of the best Marvel films ever :-)
I had to retrain myself that going to the movies is not "incredibly expensive..." I used to think "wow $12-15 for two hours... what a waste..." Amazing how spending on alcohol doesn't figure in that logical thinking at all... Now I realize I could go to the movies every week and still save money not drinking. Plus no hangover!
Reminds me of a new year's day outing where I went to see Wolf Of Wall Street.  I was so high I was nodding out during that (long) movie several times and snoring.  My wife kept hitting me and I had to pretend I even remembered what the movie was about. 
Im not a morning person at all in any way. but wow they are easier when I'm always sober.
