Its been a year since I committed to quitting drinking my longest stint of sobriety has been 48 days...Each time I fall off the wagon it seems to take longer to recover...I drank on Saturday night nothing too drastic a bottle of wine and a couple of cans of beer...I am still recovering from it Sunday was the worst day but Monday and Tuesday haven't been much better. I've had to call in sick to work Mon and Tues its been so bad...Is this the new normal for me?..Will every relapse disrupt my life this much?..I know its even more incentive to stop if it is the new normal...It makes me wonder what the hell kind of damage I've done over the years to my body and brain with alcohol.

Yes it's called [Kindling](https://www.recoveryfirst.org/blog/the-kindling-effect-of-addiction/) and it's scary stuff.
