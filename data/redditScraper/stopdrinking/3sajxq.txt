Well another day 2 is coming back around. I feel pretty good for the most part. Luckily it was only a 2 day bender this time and so most of the withdrawls I was feeling yesterday are gone. My minds a mess though. It's hard to concentrate and be focused and I don't have any desire to really do anything. I'm really sick of always feeling this way as I continue the cycle week to week. I really am ready to break that cycle and while I don't feel good about relapsing I can feel good that this is the first time I'm actually taking a proactive approach to my quitting. I have to quit...I read yesterday a great quote on someone's post that there's no such thing as a functioning alcoholic but only the stage of being a functioning alcoholic. I'm proof of that. I was a functioning alcoholic for 10 years until this year or at least I thought I was. But I've had a lot of firsts this year that have made me realize that this is only going to get worse...These firsts started the beginning of the summer after I quit a semi-serious cocaine addiction. A few weeks after I quit I was feeling really good was loving summer I can look back and see that I was almost manic in a way. This led to an increase in drinking. I got to experience benders for the first time that I've never done before as I forced myself to be productive over the weekend after waking up feeling like shit or even still drunk. As a result of these I got to experience withdrawls for the first time which I've never had in 20 years of drinking. I never want to experience those again and I don't have to if I'm smart. I got to experience waking up with my wife extremely mad because I woke up in the middle of the night pissing in the corner. I got to wake up after pissing the bed as a 37 year old something I haven't done since I was 5. I got to experience the pain of hurting my wife after acting inappropriately with another woman one night after a 3 day bender I didn't cheat but what transpired was wrong...I'm sure there's some firsts I missed writing down but I know if I continue down the path there will be plenty more. Only these firsts will have greater consequences. So..I'm done. I know it's not going to be easy I know I might have slip-ups but that's not going to stop me. I realize this thing is out my personal control right now and I'm willing to do whatever. I can admit to myself and family and friends that I need outside help. This sub has been invaluable at the beginning stages of my recovery so I thank you.

I'm glad you're here. I'm sorry to hear about all the difficulties and troubles you dealt with from your drinking but it sounds like you're on a good path now...Let us know how we can help.
Funtioning alcoholism and functional alcoholics are some of the most overused terms on SD.  Maybe /u/slipacre will put up his great graphic of the old truck with the visegrip door handle that says "I'm functioning!" or something like that.  ..I was a functional alcoholic until I wasn't is what it all boils down to.  By that most of us mean my bottom drinking did not land me in an appliance box under a bridge.  Somehow I still had my job home family luxury car etc.--but inside I was a mess.  No one knew how much trouble I was in--I needed help.
