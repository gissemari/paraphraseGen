And boy is it nice to be able to tell the nurses and the doctors that I don't drink.  It's almost an instant ruling - out of several causes for what's going on in my body......My stay is not drinking related. I'm a tall - thin person - and spontaneous pneumothorax is something that happens to us apparently (the fact that I made it to 26 without one is kind of blowing the minds of some of the nurses).  It isn't usually life threatening.  Before you panic I know it's related to the gym - so I wasn't just sitting at home and "POW!" pneumothorax.....Going to the doctor when I was drinking heavily was always a shameful event.  I had to admit to drinking more than any human should in a given week.  I had to admit that part of my health continuing to fail was due to smoking cigarettes while drinking and that it would take me longer to recover due to drinking while sick......It's going to be much easier to deal with these bills and the struggle of repairing my health as a non - drinker.  I won't drink today.

Sorry about whatever has you in the hospital but your positive attitude about not having to address the health consequences of the drinking and smoking and admitting to as much sounds really encouraging.
You just made me remember something. When my SO was pregnant one of the question was how much I drank. I lied and wrote something like 7 beers a week. I also acted as if it was an offense from them and that I didn't have to say that and blablabla...In short I was a fucking asshole who lied to everyone including himself.
Sorry you are in the hospital. I was so delighted the first time a doctor asked me "Do you drink?" and I said "No." Shocker! Congrats on your 179 days and get well soon!
