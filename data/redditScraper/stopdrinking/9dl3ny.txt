I have a desire to be free of alcohol however I can last a mere week or two before I can no longer control myself. Then a relapse occurs. I drink myself silly (I am sober for my responsibilities like work bills or driving) however I find it hard to remain sober in the evenings. I'm wondering what has worked for others to distract them from this horrible substance. I ask this sober and am searching for a ways stay that way.

Ice cream and ginger-ale were life savers for me my first few weeks.   Distract yourself with movies books exercise sleep.  It helped me to tell close friends and family members that I was doing a 30 day alcohol purge.  Now I am doing a 60 Day purge.  I don't look at my sobriety as forever but as my choice for the day.  It also helped me to check this sub at least twice a day for the first few weeks.  Good luck!  You got this!
I changed my habits and have picked up hobbies to keep me busy.  I don't allow myself to sit and just watch t.v. because thats something I did while drinking I still watch some t.v. but I'll be doing something as well for me I took up pottery gardening I picked my guitar up again and Ive been reading like crazy.  For what its worth I fell off the wagon a few times as well it happens focusing on changing my habits was key for me.
Try to pinpoint *exactly* what your line of thinking is when you decide to drink. Try to identify ["The Voice"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/7tkztb/what_are_some_of_the_sneaky_arguments_the_voice/) of your addiction. Some people give it a name. What are some of the lies and excuses the Voice tells you to convince you to drink? Make a list. Write them down. Become mindful of the Voice and recognize it as a separate entity from your true self. Observe it carefully and know that it does not want what you want: to be sober. Once I was able to extract the Voice from *me* it became much easier to avoid succumbing to the temptation. 
IRL meetings helped me.  I got a sponsor and started working the steps. It helped that I really wanted to change my life.  Meetings are not always comfortable but being a drunk is always uncomfortable. 
Recovery meetings!
What works for me is regular support. I come here every day.  Some folks try 90 meetings in 90 days.  Being part of a sober community motivates me and holds me accountable. Wishing you the best! IWNDWYT 
One guy on here named his "Voice" Gus.  Whenever Gus said it was okay to drink he would say "Shut the F up Gus!"  I sat on my hands and dared not go near the wine glasses.  Seems to be working for me...IWNDWYT
