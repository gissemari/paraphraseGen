Hey folks it's **Wednesday** and that means the week is half over! How has it been going? Share your triumphs struggles and/or general chat. I will get back to you!..Fun 'Hump Day' story: Back in my first year of college the student committee was planning on bringing in a camel for 'Hump Day'. It took only a few days for that plan to be scrapped. It even made the [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/18/camel-protest-university-st-thomas-campus_n_5349085.html)...---..**Triumph:** Right now everything in my life is fitting. I am surprised and scared to be happy (ironically). I have a great housing situation a great work and an amazing hand picked family. ..**Struggle:** Roommate was sent off to treatment for the nth time. Card was used fraudulently by him and the lady on the phone did not seem too happy but it should be taken care of.  ..**General Chat:** At this very moment if you could have 10 (ten) of anything - what would it be? .
----------immediate responses--------

I stumbled across this subreddit today and made the daily pledge. I just went to the liquor store and sat in the parking lot for a few minutes before I turned around and went home. Usually I drink a bottle of Evan Williams on Tuesday nights... But tonight that changed. Hoping this keeps up. Long road ahead of me. 
TRIUMPH: Finally coming clean to my wife and friends about my alcoholism. I've wanted to seek help in the past but never had the courage to do so. This past weekend I had that "enough is enough" moment and mustered the guts to say "I need help". Best decision of my life. ..STRUGGLE: Accepting the fact I can never drink casually again. I have always enjoyed craft beer and will truly miss it. I've got to accept though I'm no longer capable of drinking for the experience and flavor profile. I drank to get drunk and maintain that drunk usually eclipsing that into "unconscious"...GENERAL: 10 pieces of real Swiss chocolate. My mom brought some back for me from a trip she'd taken to Switzerland. It was incredible and I'll never forget it. 
*Triumph:* Great weekend with new lady friend snowshoeing and watching my Broncos sober...*Struggle:* housemate/landlady just announced she's selling the house and moving. I am extremely attached to this beautiful home and land. Feeling depressed and unmotivated...*Chat:* currently 10 would be in millions of dollars so I could easily buy my own home and land and pay off student loans and car payments. Got my mind on my money and my money on my mind.
Hmmm....TRIUMPH: Made it through a very stressful few days without even considering using to "make myself feel better". Oh and I've lost 5.5lbs since I stopped drinking 1/31/16...STRUGGLE: My Mother had to move in with me a year and a half ago because she has dementia and couldn't live alone anymore. I'm feeling worn out and over this huge responsibility...CHAT: I would like 10 days of vacation in Italy. Food Beautiful Sights Food Shopping. :)
Triumph: 16 days! It's been over a year since I've had 16 days sober and although each day is a renewed opportunity to keep the stream going today I am proud of myself...Struggle: very concerned about the safety of a loved one and feeling frustrated that the system supposedly in place to protect this person instead seems to guard the "rights" of the person from whom she needs protecting. I've never felt so helpless in my life...General chat: I'd take ten days vacation in a nice warm relaxing place.
Triumph : Sport night without beer after...Struggle : too much caffeine..General Chat : 10 free days without thinking about beer would be great. But I would gladly take the 10 millions too...
Triumph: Today's my 90th day and man I am *so* proud of that. I'd been trying and failing for a long time to get past about 30 so this feels like a huge milestone...Struggle: I'm dealing with passive aggressive behaviour from a classmate and it's making me feel really ill. I also do not like conflict so welcoming this opportunity for growth feels more like a drag by the heels screaming and swearing through my own personal hell...General chat: ten delicious calorie-free pizzas. Mmmmmm.
Triumph: Continue regular attendance the gym for a week and a half starting to see small indications good health and weight results.  ..Struggle: Alcoholic neighbours being friendly inviting me over but causing a major headache regarding avoiding temptation and at the same time not being impolite to them while trying to phase them out of my life...General Chat: 10 dates...I'm ready for love!
**Triumph:** Won the argument with my (part-time) employer. Finding sobriety comfortable....**Struggle:** Not letting my guard down on sobriety determination. (This is very real). That uncomfortable pay period switch....**General Chat:** Ten? Paid days off. 
**Triumph:** Had a great run Sunday morning. I've been off my training the past month so ran without a clock on effort alone. My goal was to have fun. I succeeded and still put in a decent time. Then the Broncos finally held it together and I brought just enough seltzer for the dieters and myself...**Struggle:** I'm really struggling with my 6 year old right now. my frustration tolerance is extremely low to non-existent. Not fun...**Chat:** 10 oz of coffee. Must brew more...

Love the Camel story! 
*Triumph:* Haven't had a drink for 38 days. Haven't really wanted a drink either...*Struggle:* I'm going to need to find a new place to live in the next six weeks. I'm very torn about what to do and where to move. Still not getting good sleep at all. Also remaining mostly socially isolated and lonely. Work is busy and utterly pointless...*Chat:* I could use a ten-day vacation preferably in another country and involving trains.
Triumph: I've been going to an AA meeting every night..Struggle: Having trouble with resentment and feeling annoyed by everything..Chat: 10 lost pounds!
- Triumphs  I made it 40 days and my Triglycerides are cut in half in 38 days.- Struggles  not with out its highs and lows but more highs than lows.- Chat  I'm giving me a big pat on the back welcome to the 40s.-  /u/Bluejay888

Triumph: I managed to clean up our spare room to make way for [this little guy](http://imgur.com/uf33ldl) coming back to the foster house fold for a week ..Struggle: I have chronic fatigue and three days into sobriety I have had a flare up of symptoms. Don't know whether I was drinking to feel normal and not in pain or whether it's a combo of that with other stuff (cycled for the first time in months yesterday and have a cold). Anyway I feel very crappy and it's hurting my resolve to do right by myself.....General Chat: I would have ten more hours so I could sleep and rest off this fatigue!
**Triumph:** Last night I gained a very good/supportive friend back by being honest about my alcohol problem and apologizing for hurtful things I did...**Struggle:** I am still having trouble with confidence as I continue to meet people while still learning about my "new" self. ..**General Chat:** It's funny how [awkward](http://imgur.com/mr30g8X) some people are when finding out I'm sober. I used to be the same way! ..**Bonus** - I'd love to have 10 acres of land... So I could rescue all the dogs and cats I wanted and they'd have room to play :) 
**Triumph:** I've made it four days without drinking...**Struggle:** I'm back at work after a brief hiatus and am having a hard time not letting it cause me misery...**General Chat:** a 10-day Vipassana meditation retreat.
**Triumph:** I've picked up baking again! I made Smitten Kitchen's ['the browniest cookies'](http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2015/12/the-browniest-cookies/) and everyone really enjoyed them. Solid recipe I recommend it. ..**Struggle**: My sleep has gone even more downhill. I automatically pick up the phone to browse reddit no matter what time it is in the night and fall asleep staring at the phone. Another bad habit to work on...**General Chat:** I would have ten bags of food shopping delivred to my door so I didn't have to go out and get it myself...Today is the first day of Lent. I'm not religious in the slightest but I observe the 'giving up certain luxuries' aspect some years as I did when I was a child. So I'm adding soda chocolate crisps and pizza to my do-not-have list for the duration! It's strange what practices you hang on to while others are left behind but I feel good about doing it this year.
i will not drink today!!!!!!
**Triumph:** We are financially stable despite me leaving my job I have decided to stick with my assigned therapist even though she doesn't have an addiction background/specialty or whatnot - we click I recieved good news about my liver and don't have to go back to the doctor for a while and I got the ball rolling with school...**Struggle:** Although the ball is rolling it keeps finding pot holes my online workbook isn't working so I can't practice what I am learning in my book - I am the type of person that need to apply information to learn. I can't seem to get back into my routine and feel like I lost interest in things again. I still want to workout do art porjects etc but I seem to have lost my oomph or drive. Being dependent on my husband financially is driving me crazy I feel like I am fourteen again explaining that I need to buy makeup or what not...**General Chat:** If I could have ten of anything I would choose.... ten free all inclusive adventures. See the grand canyon great barrier reef sky dive etc
Triumph: I work in theatre and I just found the funding that will build the set for our next production. Also our outreach programs are doing some fantastic things and we're about to start a program in a juvenile corrections facility. ..Struggle: I reset my badge yesterday (though it hasn't gone through yet.) My second job is at a restaurant and yesterday the bartender offered me a sample of the new wine. Without thinking I grabbed the glass and took a drink. I'm newly sober so it was really a mechanical reaction. Once I realized what I had done I got discouraged and decided that if I already had the sip I might as well finish the sample. Now I'm back to day one. ..Chat: 10 acceptance letters to grad school. I have a good career going but if I really want to take it to a point where I don't also have to work in restaurants I need that MFA. I'm hoping that being sober will help motivate me to get my applications in. 
**Triumph:** Yesterday I had a job interview for a professional-level job in my field something I haven't had for a couple of years due to my own poor decisions. It was my first job interview since quitting drinking (which lets my antidepressant do its job so my anxiety was much less). I was SO CALM and clearheaded it was great. I answered the interview questions thoroughly without getting carried away into anxious babbling...**Struggle:** Realizing that smoking pot and binge-eating in the evening is making me feel kind of crappy in the mornings (and is reversing the weight-control effects of exercising) and so now I have to start dealing with that as well. Dammit I was just here to quit drinking not to stop all my bad habits...**General chat:** I think I'd like 10 more friends. Or maybe 10 successful dates with the same person. Or (of course) ten million dollars!
*Triumph*: I just submitted the full final draft of my dissertation and my committee chair said to go ahead and apply for graduation. I'll have my Ph.D. in May! I've gotten so much done in the past 36 days compared to the days of drunken attempts to write. I can't believe it. ..*Struggle*: I owe $5000 in income taxes. I'm not thrilled about it and don't know how I'm going to afford it... but I'm pretty sure drinking won't make me owe any less. ..*General*: I'd love to have ten round-trip airline tickets so my girlfriend and I can go on five amazing trips. :)
**Triumph**:  I'm self employed and I have more work now than I can handle...**Struggle**:  PAWS getting me down still.  ..**General** chat: 10 hours of sleep at night (I feel I need it this month).
**Triumph:** I have a super cool friendly supportive sponsor and we're starting my step work today. it's kinda scary but the progress feels great. ..**Struggle:** BOUNDARIES. keeping them has always been a struggle for me... add sobriety to the mix and I have no idea how the hell to deal with people sometimes. who has my best interest at heart when do I say no etc etc......**General Chat:** I'd love ten days on tour with NIN so I can see my gloriously sober role model in action. I'm drawn to the gritty and dark - music paintings poetry film.... how does he produce and perform such intense art while keeping that stable healthy baseline for himself?
**Triumph:** Over the past few days I definitely lifted off a plateau I've been on for a while now- I have my food dialed in eating very clean I've had a run of strong workouts productive at work patient with my kid.  Just embracing the good while it's here knowing that even this too shall pass :) ...**Struggle:** Bunch of dental work coming up- pain painkillers and price very soon.  Time to pay the piper for years of neglect...**GC:** Ten more hours in the day- I'd get more play time with the kiddo another workout and a nap in.
Not going to drink on this fine day.
Triumph: Tomorrow will be 14 days for me. ..Struggle: Staying positive this week. I'm swamped with work and school. ..General Chat: At this very moment if you could have 10 (ten) of anything - what would it be? Puppies. 10 roly-poly wrinkly fluffy little puppies. I would roll around with them all day. Puppies make everything better! 
**Triumph:** 10 days without a drink and feeling good!.**Struggle:** Want to use some of my newfound time and energy to get into a workout routine.  So far I am failing miserably at that.  .**General Chat:** I'm grateful for ten (10) days sober and would like 10 more!  Will keep taking them one at a time though.  
All triumphs and no struggles so far but its only been two days so we'll see!
Not drinking today .
Triumph: Had a really good day and wasn't tempted by the beer and liquor specials when we went to a restaurant today. I was able to say NO thank you. :) Tomorrow is Day 90 which I am celebrating tonight with a nice dinner out with the whole family. ..Struggle: Our 13 year old son isn't doing his homework again and we just bought him a brand new laptop to replace the other one that he had that has been broken for over a year now. I was looking forward to letting him use it right away BUT now he has something to look forward to. It just broke my heart that I couldn't give it to him tonight. Otherwise no struggles here!..General Chat: I bought myself a new camcorder to record the kids and stuff with and I am REALLY excited about that. We also paid off two debts that we had and that is going to save us a nice amount of money now each month since we won't have to pay them anymore! Relief. :) ..To answer your question: If I could have 10 of something what would it be? 10 more lifetimes to be with my kids...10 more wonderful endless happy days...10 more kisses from my 13 year old son and 10 more times X infinity to hear them all say I love you mama.:) I don't need anything more than that right now.
Triumph: it's been over a month for me and each day I notice myself missing drinking less and less. Pretty much everything in my life is awesome without it..Struggle: I'm struggling to pony up and finish my application to paramedic school. I know I want to do it but I am terrified..Chat: I would like 10 hours to sleep and snuggle with my dogs! 
**Triumph:** I've been out of rehab for 2 weeks and have had no cravings or urges. This is my first week back at work and things are going better than ever..**Struggle:** My youngest son is having a hard time re-adjusting to me being home he's only 7 I am trying to be very patient with him..**General:** Right now I would like 10 more days or sobriety but I'd absolutely settle for one!.
Triumph: My house is clean. Really clean. I had the energy to clean everything finish ALL the laundry (I don't remember a time where that has happened in my busy home in a very long time) cook dinner do all the dishes vacuum dust clean the bathroom play with my son get him fed looked after and to bed on time the dog cared for and a decent meal. All since 4pm. I was done all that by 7:30pm. Today was a fantastic day and now I'm about to do yoga! I am LOVING this momentum! .Struggle: Had a down day at work. Wanted to buy wine for the first time in a little while. .Ten: extra hours in the day so I could really do a long yoga have time for a long bath and then extra time to just laze about before needing to go to bed. There just aren't enough hours in the day. .
Triumph: I quit drinking N days ago and quit smoking about 45 days ago.  I don't have to worry about those substances controlling me anymore...Struggle:  today is one of those days I have to endure painful emotions instead of numb them.  I'm happy for that but it's hard too.  Not that I have any desire to drink just... Life being hard on its own...Chat: how about 10 virgin pi a coladas? :P
.Triumph: Things seem to be going good at work. I had a PEP put in place so they could potentially fire me in March [nothing to do with drinking//boss out to get me/autoimmune and depression diagnosis] But my boss has been nice lately and I am hopeful I will get a new job. Looking for wedding dress next weekend! EEEppp! Working out consistently! ..Struggle:Grad school is hard. ..Yay! 13 days I keep giving in on drinking on Day 14 but I already plan to go to yoga that night and instead of thinking about drinking wine because grad school is SO stressfull I will just look at wedding dresses online instead. 
The struggle is real !... but I made it by day 1 again .. off to the races now.
*Triumph*Getting to 500 days of sobriety!.*Struggle* Regaining my balance after 8 weeks of being in a non-weight bearing cast..*General Chat* It is finally winter cold here! .
*Triumph*Getting to 500 days of sobriety!.*Struggle* Regaining my balance after 8 weeks of being in a non-weight bearing cast..*General Chat* It is finally winter cold here! .
Triumph: Everything is falling into place with work and I'm starting to feel more confident all around. I'm running again and feeling healthier.    .    .Struggle: The time between finishing up school and finding jobs has me scraping by with my bills and everything but I keep telling myself that the extended break I allowed myself actually made me so much healthier in mind and spirit. And for me that's all that matters right now.    .    .General Chat: If I could have ten of anything right now it would be ten days at a nice hot springs resort somewhere with little cabins to stay in. Yep. That sounds amazing right about now.
