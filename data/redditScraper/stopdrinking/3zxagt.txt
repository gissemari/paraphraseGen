I'm at 14 days now and things are continuing to improve. Hopefully this can help give an indication to others earlier in the process of what to expect and also help me if I'm ever worried about relapsing...**Physical**..* My resting heart rate has dropped from 75bpm to 60pm. I guess as a daily drinker I never actually measured it in the past when I didn't have alcohol in the system though..* .I feel like my stamina has increased. I live on the fourth floor of a Victorian tenement building and I'm able to run up the stairs without getting out of breath now..* I'm sleeping a lot but I'm still always really tired. This seems to be getting a little worse even although this could be down to me going back to work a few days ago..* My skin seems to be looking better and my eyes somehow look sharper. I've been taking a photo of myself each day since I quit just to monitor any changes and it's noticeable...**Mental**..* My concentration is definitely improving. It's happening so gradually it's hard to notice but I managed to sit down and watch an entire film without pausing taking a break or doing anything else the other day. Sounds silly but I hadn't been able to do that in many years..* Despite the concentration improvements I'm still finding it hard to get the drive to actually do stuff even though I usually enjoy things once I get going. I guess this is me still in the alcoholic lazy mindset..* I definitely feel sharper this has become apparent since I've been back at work this week. I'm a software developer and I've been able to tackle a few problems I'd been sweeping under the carpet or avoiding in the past..* My anxiety seems to be reducing. It's still quite bad but I can notice the difference in small things like feeling comfortable making small talk to people I don't know that well at work....**Other**..* I've stopped biting my fingernails. This just seemed to happen by itself I didn't consciously stop but I was never aware of myself biting them previously so maybe it's related to anxiety or something..* The sugar addiction seems to be calming down at last!.* I've lost 6kg..Thanks for reading. Hope everybody is having a great and sober day..

I love when people shed some light on the improvements in physical/mental health after quitting. It provides newbies like me more motivation to stay quit. Thanks for sharing. 
This is great and so helpful for people to read. ..Just a note it took my "drive" quite awhile to kick into gear... I think my body was doing a lot of work healing itself. 
Great reflection. I'm planning on starting my own journal of the observed benefits of abstaining from drinking. :).

Thank you so much for posting this. It really gives me a lot of motivation and hope!
This is great!  Very encouraging - thanks!
&gt; My anxiety seems to be reducing. It's still quite bad but I can notice the difference in small things like feeling comfortable making small talk to people I don't know that well at work...This was the biggest thing I've been happy for. I steadily noticed it decreasing and although there have been a few times where I had some anxiety now I notice that there were other reasons for it and didn't just try to mask it with alcohol.
