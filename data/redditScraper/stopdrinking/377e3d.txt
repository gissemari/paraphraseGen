Day 1:   .Fresh from relapse. And I am still drinking. What a surprise. I just don't know how to deal with these feelings. My whole body hurts. I don't know if I had a seizure again or what.     ..	It started on Saturday when I was able to talk to her. The overall consensus is that we would never be back together again. And I understand; it was my entire fault. So of course I went to the liquor store and bought a cheap bottle of vodka and went to fucking town on that son of a bitch. I ended up going downtown and can't quite remember much of it; aside from acting like an ass like I usually do whilst drunk. I woke up at 3PM on Sunday and had no fucking idea what happened. My whole body was sore. Did I get in a fight? Did I seize again? I have no fucking idea. Then I see a note from a stranger who apparently gave me a ride home.  Beautiful key is under the door -Steve.  I still don't know what that means. At least he was a good enough guy not to steal my k-pins. Not too much to update other than that. I will probably elaborate a little later. I am just too drunk to even think right now. Hopefully in the future that will change. .
