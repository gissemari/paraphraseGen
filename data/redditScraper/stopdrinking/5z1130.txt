I was successfully moderating with the help of my boyfriend. He doesn't drink much so I set rules: I wouldn't drink unless he expressly suggested it first I needed to objectively want to drink for reasons unassociated with getting drunk and I would never raise the idea of a second drink. It was working so well that we were throwing away wine as it had turned to vinegar...But yesterday I went out with friends. My boyfriend wasn't there. One friend is terrible for ensuring your glass is filled. I have no idea how much I drank. I just know that when I was concentrating on eating about 3 more wine refills happened. My glass ended up completely full...And so I drank it. And then had beer. And by the time I got a grip on myself I was drunk and my body was telling me to stop rather than my mind. What happened self control?!..I threw up a very nice dinner last night because alcohol. I had a large greasy breakfast this morning because alcohol. I have been hungover and unable to focus properly on work because alcohol. And I still feel really ropey. Because alcohol...I really want to get angry and blame my friend for continuing to fill my glass even though the level ended up higher than everyone else's. But I shouldn't. I always had it in my power to say 'stop' and 'that's enough' and I said nothing...I'm struggling to be kind to myself. If I take responsibility then it means that I failed and worse than that I put staying quiet and fucking up my Sunday above saying no. I feel so weak and like maybe I want to fuck myself over. I don't know how to deal with failure except by shouting at myself...So I'm back to not drinking. I feel like I had a good thing going with moderation and maybe I did. But if I can't say 'stop' then I need to say 'no'.
