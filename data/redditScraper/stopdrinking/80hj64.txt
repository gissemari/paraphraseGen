Hungover. And would love to cave to watch the game tonight at one of the usual spots - it's $5 burger night and they have $6 PB&amp;Js all day everyday.. but if I do one week sober is +1more day away. Felt so great last week after making it 5 days want that feeling all the time. Not this awkward fogginess where I'm struggling to type think function. Why is this so damn hard.

I know the feeling. The first day is the toughest thinking there's a quick fix. But it's not a fix it just pushes it ahead of you. Grab a better burger somewhere else; even with an 11 dollar burger you'll be ahead. I will not drink with you tonight.
