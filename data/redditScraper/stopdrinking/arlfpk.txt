Welcome back.  Don't give up.  Most of us have had slips. ..Give yourself a break  and see what you can learn from it... use it as a learning tool. ..Hang in there.  IWNDWYT 
Lets focus on the root of the problem. Why did you relapse?
Glad you're back! 
Be kind to yourself. We've all been there. IWNDWYT.
I am praying for you.  One day at a time.
