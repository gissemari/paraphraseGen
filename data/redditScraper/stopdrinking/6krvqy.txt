Despite an awful day today I did not listen to the beer calling me...I did it. I reached 120 days of sobriety!!!..Physically I am sleeping better. I sometimes get headaches and I have woken up feeling like I have a hangover headache despite my sobriety. ..Most of the time I don't want a drink. I still crave bad foods I got in the habit of eating while drinking beer. ..I notice The Stink on hungover coworkers. I am not impressed by drinking stories. I drank incredible amounts until I upset my family and affected my health. Certainly did not help me at various jobs -- basically all the jobs I held for 20 years...I have problems still. I need to address issues in my marriage. Depression blame and self-loathing have not disappeared. ..It is a struggle but somehow I made it this far. Not sure where I want to take me the rest of this year.
