I heard something a few days ago that resonated with me. I admitted that I had given sobriety my all--I had tried everything I could think of and that others suggested. The list is ad nauseam: residential rehab outpatient getting a sponsor following directions calling them every day going to meetings step work CBT Smart Recovery yoga walking dogs after work calling people from the meetings especially if I wanted to drink and even if not.......I was exhausted and knew I could never sustain MY efforts. So the idea that was said to me was to admit this give myself credit for trying and surrender. Ask a higher power to help me (for me I know there are life-force dimensions beyond my capacity to see them.) I know I have heard about surrendering for years but I never quite heard it this way-- I never realized that really I was trying to control the process and using my will--even if I did what others told me-- I still was "in charge." Like I said it has been exhausting and could never be sustained. So I am still going to meetings -- mostly twice a day but I am no longer "trying so hard" and it feels much lighter than I have felt in a long time. I know the cravings will likely come back but I want to remember the surrender on a daily or hourly basis to allow the space to let a better life in. Thanks to all for being here-- a place to speak my truth and hope to stay in this reality-- to float rather than keep struggling against the current.
