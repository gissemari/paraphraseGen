I am!! My badge makes a big difference seems a little corny that a grown adult cares about such a trivial thing but it works for me so I'm into it. Whatever motivation works that's for me. Within reason of course. One of my reasons not to drink is that it'd take me ages (123 days to be precise) to get back to 123 on my badge! I'd hate to lose > 100 days on my tally.  .To say this another way my sober journey has taken an unexpected turn thanks to SD and all of you here. I stopped drinking with a plan to go back once my health recovered. Now I am seriously thinking about never drinking again as the days pile up on my badge. Cheers with soda to all of you SD sobernauts lurkers abstainers relapsers tentatives and contributors. Oh and big thanks to the mods you're pretty good here on SD.

Positive reinforcement works for many mammals including dogs cats horses.....and people.  It works for me too as well as the chips from AA.   As long as we are rewarded we are repeatedly connecting neurons to repeat this behavior (not drinking).  It's a good habit to cultivate!.Also another big Thank You to our great mods.
My Marine Corps boyfriend used to tell me "You'd be amazed at what some men would do for a little piece of ribbon" (meaning a badge on his chest). I think of that when I think of what my stopdrinking badge means to me.
Congrats on 123!!!   I've been so excited about hitting 100 soon...  Thanks for giving me another good number to focus on!
Easy as 123. Congrats!
