So day one went well.  I "came out" to my best friend who has also struggled with addiction (not substances but they use the same support model as AA) and started a good dialog...He checked on my a few times throughout the night when I typically have issues.  I was already doing fine but it was nice to have the contact...Starting back up a hobby today will be a nice distraction...Thank you all for this place and yourselves...Edit: Two night sober which are really the harder times for me so I guess maybe I'm on day 3?

It's a major victory when you reclaim your life. Glad your here buddy.
Great job! It's nice to have someone to reach out to you in case things start going wrong. Remember that you have a support network if you need it. Enjoy your new/old hobby! Stopping drinking gave me so much more energy to pursue my interests and frankly a whole new life. 
It's great that you've been able to come out to someone about this and that they can keep an eye out during the withdrawal stage...Hobby sounds like a great idea too I find it important to build activities into my life.
