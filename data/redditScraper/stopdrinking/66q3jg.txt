Hi all...I never figured I'd do this but the past few weeks have really made me reevaluate decisions I've made in my life...For some context I'm a general fuck up who realized too late that there are actually things wrong with my brain. Severe ADHD with comorbid depression which was only highlighted by what was basically morbid obesity (370 pounds at 23)...I'm here obviously on a throwaway but... I think I need to to do this. I have the most loving most caring and most supportive family in the entire world. I'm not saying we are perfect as a family we have issues but we love each other without condition or question...Two years ago I got a gastric bypass surgery. It seems like the easy way out but I promise it isn't. I lost 70 pounds thanks to surgery. I lost 50 more because of effort and more importantly support (My mother did it with me and my father supported us both. They are my heroes and saviors...Unfortunately I think I hit a patch that is similar to many gastric bypass patients. My addiction to food seems to be searching for new release. Alcohol is the primary culprit. It was the worst when I had my surgery and there was just time between...Since then I had went to a psychiatrist and was prescribed Ritalin for ADHD. It's a lifesaver and in the last year I've done more than my whole life (Being normal is weird)...It went well for a long time I think but eventually my younger brother got a job and was training overseas. I was proud of my little man but it hurt that I'm such a screw up that I couldn't do it myself. It hurt more that he was suddenly gone. My brother is my best friend and he means everything to me. It wasn't until recently I realized how much I derailed when he left. ..Drinking became a regular thing and it put a strain on my amazing family around me. ..I'm... better. I have medication and I'm newly on anti-depressants. It helps a lot I drink way less I'm not drunk daily... I still want to post here...I want help to not ever go back there. I don't want to hurt my family. They are everything to me. I know that alcohol can ruin all of that...We all like wine we really do. I love nothing more than sitting with them all and having a glass of wine maybe two. My struggle comes when I have to say no to the third. ..I don't want to go there. I don't want to do this to them. I want to be normal I want to function. ..If it means I have to sacrifice wine for good fine. I guess some part of me hopes to manage to still drink with them socially never again alone...I don't know what I expect from posting here but I promised to myself I would. I promised I'd make an effort to save them unnecessary heartache because I'm too selfish to manage my own issues properly...So yeah here I am. Clueless inexperienced and with no idea what to expect.

Totally unrelated but I honestly don't understand using a throwaway account to post here.  I mean is the effort to stop drinking also a throwaway?  And how come I gotta look at the keyboard to type throwaway?..Sounds like you need to express yourself clearly when a bottle of wine is opened up.  For example "y'all go ahead but I'm taking my self out of the room cuz that's just too much for me to even see".  Ain't nothin' wrong with being honest right?..BTW people who can manage their drinking don't hardly ever understand how impossibly difficult that is for the rest of us.  And it ain't on them to get it OR deal with it.  The problem is ours as is the solution: be honest remove yourself from the situation find others who've walked your path and hang with them for a while...Best of luck on your journey!
Hi there. You seem like you are making fantastic changes in your life. Good for you! But everything isn't going to be smooth and it looks like alcohol may be a bump...I have no idea about your problems with alcohol and how serious they are but I will tell you what worked for me. ..I don't think about "never drinking alcohol again". I'm just not drinking today. I'm doing an experiment of sorts. Im seeing how my life with and without alcohol compares. So far the sober version is working out well...I'm just not drinking today and tomorrow I will not drink either. ..It is just alcohol you have your whole life what is a month or two without drinking if you aren't sure it's a problem?
