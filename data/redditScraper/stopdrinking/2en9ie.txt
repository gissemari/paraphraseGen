3 weeks in now and i want a drink more than anything but won't do it. Too stubborn too consider it an option. Now that everyone that's close to me knows too I'd feel stupid getting drunk and losing their respect. I've gone through periods where I'm "shitting rainbows" then times were I feel depressed and the occasional mood swings.  Exhaustion and headaches probably from all of the coffee as well. Over all though I feel good almost like it's a trick like i could go have some drinks casually but I know better.  That's how I relapsed last time. They're not going to fool me with that ace of spades up their sleeve.

Sounds about right!  Keep it up; you are doing great!
Well done sydneypepper - it sounds as though you're getting adept at spotting/dismissing those devious rationalisations so many of us are prone to. The low energy low mood headaches and all those nuisance symptoms will clear eventually just hang in there and hold onto that all-important realisation that a part of your mind can finds all sorts of clever ways to trick you into drinking but that as long as you stay vigilant you will know better :-D  Keep up the good work! 
Congrats. Stubborn is good but you may need more..Have you considered AA or Smart to address the things which made you a drinker in the first place?
Nice - Im coming up the road behind you.  Very similar findings.  I may be a bit more aggressive towards my inner voice and the cravings now.   I realized quickly this Voice that tells you its OK to drink casually or what about now - Now would be perfect to pop a cold one- Is a skilled adversary and this is a war that Im not loosing.  When I hear the first work I cut the SOB off and literally tell him that is not longer an option were finding something else to do.  Congratulations on your new journey
