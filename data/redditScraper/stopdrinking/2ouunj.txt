Good morning /sd!..Ohmigod Ohmigod Ohmigod - [Guess What Day It Is?!?](http://i.imgur.com/FLfwKEQ.jpg)..So here we are in the throes of the Holiday Olympics. Some of us have already slain a few dragons (office parties holiday mixers) and others are steeling up for a challenge ahead. Let's circle our wagons to ensure we spend this day together sober! Please share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations below...**Triumph**: I didn't drink at a big social event last night. It was people who I really want to like me and most of them didn't know I quit drinking. Someone ordered many rounds of drinks for the table and the waiter kept trying to put one in front of me but I kept declining. At one point in a snit of frustration I think I even said "I'm off the sauce!" (Good lord it's Grandpa Cakes!) ..**Struggle**: It's the same struggle I had last week - I'm over-scheduled. I can feel it eating away at my "sober confidence" a bit and it's making me wary and a little extra cautious. I'm not sure how to handle it right now since all the stuff I have scheduled is stuff I really want to do. Maybe make sure I have a lot of down time in January? I'm open to ideas. ..**General Chat**: Do you have a name for your "sober confidence" like I referenced above? Do you call it "resolve" or "strength" or something else? I'm always looking to expand my sobriety taxonomy. :)..What's going on with you guys?
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph: I didn't drink. I moved into a halfway house in Ann Arbor and am surrounded by a huge AA community. ..Struggle: I had a pretty big craving for a beer. It's only been 88 days since my last drink 83 since my last Xanax. I don't want to jeopardize my sobriety for a quick buzz as I will surely go for the gold and drink more after just one beer. "The struggle is real"..Other than that I am pretty good. I'm working on my first step with my sponsor. He's having me write a few pages about my using and my recovery. I have a job interview at 12:30 and can't wait to hit up a meeting or two. It should be a good week. 
Triumph: I'm coming up on one hundred days! Can't believe it. It just seems to have happened. ..struggle: I've realised I don't have any major passion in my life. Lots of interest but no direction or drive. I feel like I'm floating along with no direction. I have also been using staying sober as an excuse for a bad diet. Need to get my eating under control. 
Triumph - Almost finished Christmas shopping! (Does this count?  It's the best I can muster today)..Struggle - I'm feeling bummed and my eating is way out of control.  I don't think about drinking at all (never had a problem with quitting) but I seem to just replace addictions with other addictions. ..General Chat - I &lt;3 Christmastime.  I am enjoying Christmas movies Christmas music Christmas decorations everything.  I know the holidays are hard for people but there's a lot of fun stuff to focus on too!
Great job resisting temptation Grandpa\^wCakes!..**Triumph**: Over the weekend I went to a Holiday party thrown by a friend.  Lots of alcohol.  Lots of people that were more than slightly inebriated.  One person that reminded me of me (sweating overweight slurring saying stupid shit kept saying that I was a "great guy" (he'd just met me)).  I had to politely decline several offers for drinks.  But nobody asked why.  Nobody even mentioned that my hands were empty or when they weren't I was drinking a soda.  Sobriety feels good man.  And it feels great to be able to socialize even with drinkers bordering on drunk...**Struggle**: I've got nothing.  Life is fucking awesome!..**General Chat**: Last night two club pros and a friend of mine (who is also very good) were hitting -- just the three of them.  I had just finished playing a mixed doubles match and I asked them kind of jokingly if they needed a fourth.  They waved me over.  It was awesome.  We played two sets of doubles (a 5.0 + a 4.0 on each side of the court).  I've never been on the court with people hitting the ball so hard.  I played great and I was on the winning side!  BEST. NIGHT. EVER! (playing tennis)
Triumph: I got through the worst of quitting (the first whole week was not good).Struggle: I continue to struggle with where I'm going with this depression and feeling very alone and judged (while knowing a lot of the negativity is all in my head...)..But my mood is very slowly getting better with each new day and I'm very thankful for that.
**Triumph:** I have gone 5 days with no booze. My SO went to some concert and was drinking with her "friends" messaging me through the night clearly a bit out of it. I had a pretty intense jealousy induced trigger to walk to the liquor store and grab a pint of cheap stuff but I didn't...**Struggle:** I don't know how strong I will be in the near future and I do not know where my relationship stands with her now that I face sobriety...**General Chat:** I have been looking at my sober confidence as more of a scientific fact of genetics that I simply can not drink. So I say I have boozeintolerant. Like how people with nut allergies simply have to stay away from nuts I simply have to stay away from booze. 
Triumph: Went out to a bar for trivia night last one.  Our team won the first round and we got free nachos!  Drinking ginger ale and club sodas all night my bar tab after 3 hours was $2.25...Struggle: We are in the middle of moving.  So many moments where the ingrained idea of "I just had a manly day of manly moving and manual manly labour time to crack open a cold one" have come and gone.  Some friends gave us a bottle of sparkling wine as a housewarming present which I don't think was meant to be malicious but that bothers me.  Other friends gave us a 12-pack of big perrier bottles so it evens out!
I switched to a new username because I had co-workers that jump around Reddit.  ..Triumph: I pulled out all of my old marathon trophies and placed them on my dresser. As skeptical as I have been about spiritual awakening - something is telling me to get back into running and give another shot at a semi-elite status. I am opening up my thoughts and my heart to my AA group which in turn is helping me be more open with my wife. I find myself much more compassionate with her thoughts. ..Struggle: The spiritual part of my recovery. I'm struggling with my "higher power". ..General Chat: I have my eye on 30 days. I just can't wait to reach that and there's really nothing standing in my way at this point. Very excited.
**Triumph**: 60 days! I've also lost 10 pounds. 7 more will get me to my goal weight...**Struggle**: I have my work holiday party coming up on Friday *and* my secret Santa giftee requested beer as their gift. Sigh. If it was wine I'd ask my girlfriend to go to the store and buy it for me. I'm not crazy about beer but nonetheless the idea of going to the liquor store and trying to pick out something tasty has me in a funk. ..**General chat**: Milestones are weird huh? I've been pretty good about taking this one day at a time but with the approach/arrival of 60 I find myself thinking "ok now I just have to get to 90 days and then to my birthday and then through 2015 and then the next 50 years...." Whoa. Slow down and take a breath. 
**Triumph:** I had dinner with friends and their kids last night and when the waitress took our order I ordered a root beer like the kids had done and one of the them turned to me and said 'wow you like root beer and not the real stuff?' I told him I didn't like the real stuff and preferred root beer he said the real stuff is gross. Not really a triumph but it made me feel good that he noticed and acknowledged it...**Struggle:** Dealing with getting new internet and TV service at my house has been an epic struggle. I have no idea how a company could be so incompetent and still be in business. They've literally messed up every step of the way...**General Chat:** Christmas decorations will go up at our house this weekend and the parties start this weekend too!
**Triumph:** I'm the only one in the family who hasn't been sick for three or more days in a row. I've played nurse worked 50+ hours got the kids to school on time (when they went) kept everyone fed the house mostly clean and had some fun. No cravings only lost my cool a few times... feels pretty good to type all that out...**Struggle:** Fuck the D. I was doing well then dropped into a period of moderate-severe depression last week. *But* it was only a few days and I came up quickly. This mindfulness thing is paying off because I was able to identify some factors that make it worse...**Chat:** Christmas is my least favorite holiday. 15 more days...
Triumph: My parents offered me a glass of wine yesterday and I declined. ..Struggle: I quit recently and was using drinking to mask other problems (poorly and ineffectively I might add). I'm in the process of challenging those problems and it's hard...General Chat: Everything is so vivid! It feels like a fog has been lifted. I had no idea quitting drinking would make me feel like this.
**Triumph** Last night I took my husband out to dinner and a movie. We saw Interstellar and both cried and held hands. I love that man with all my heart. It felt so nice to just hang out with each other...**Struggle** Money is tight these days. I have faith and trust that we can get through this next year and be okay. Everything we need we have...**General chat** Christmas tree is up. Gifts are being bought. Excitement is building. 
Triumph: everything that hasn't gone wrong. ..Struggle: finals! Woo! 
Second day of no alcohol in my system.  Mood swings are intense.  Honestly the longest time I haven't had a sip.
**Triumph:** Yesterday was pure shit. I don't even know why. It just was. I had a lot of thoughts about giving up but I didn't! And today has been pretty great! Funny how that works out. ..**Struggle:** I've been feeling like my recovery has been pretty weak lately. I always feel like I'm one shitty thought away from drinking. Ever since I passed day 30 I'm kind of just like "what now?" I know what I need to do to fix this it's just a matter of actually doing it. ...**General Chat:** I'm getting my hair cut tonight. You know what I never did when I was drinking? Get my hair cut. 
One of my personal heroes is sober just found out! Bill Corbett of MST3K! http://i.imgur.com/6lMQnzG.jpg
**Triumph:** 10 days with no real cravings or urges to drink. Passed up a ready meal in the freezer today because it was "chicken with white wine pasta" and while the content would obviously be negligible it would have still mentally felt like a failure...**Struggle:** Not sure what to do with support groups. My second AA meeting was a bad experience. I'm currently looking at it as a "tool in my repetoire" in case things get tougher but I'm probably not going back anytime soon. Also still not figured out how to build my confidence without needing alcohol to do it...**General Chat:** Don't know really.
Triumph:  Just crossed the 7 month mark finished 3/4 of my college finals and I've been exercising eating healthy and regularly attending aa...Struggle:  Feels like I'm doing everything I should be doing but there's this nagging feeling still.  Dating has been frustrating so far and waking up with headaches when I didn't drink the night before is stifling...General Chat: Looking forward to going skiing this winter going to try to get up to the mountains any chance I can (SoCal).
