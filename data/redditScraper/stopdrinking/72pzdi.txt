Im really struggling to get back on the wagon. My job is in the shitter my most recent relationship is in the shitter. I have been miserable for thr past 4 years and i really just dont know how to change it or where to start. Getting a new job would probably be a good start but i just dont think anyone would want me and i just want to drink and forget everything and not be here

Hey. The road may well be hard. And you know drinking won't make it easier. On the contrary...You're not alone not here. Hang in there. Be in relationship.
The wagon is right here for you.  I find sober life a lot better than I thought I would.  Don't give up.  Hop on board.
I feel like saying what so many other people have said on this sub: Drinking doesn t make it better. Things are so much easier with a clear head and a healthier body. In my experience the problems won t go away but they will be so much easier to handle. And... I don t mean to sound clich  or anything but I m sure that there s a wonderful version of you waiting to bloom. What s keeping you down and what can lift you up?
Here's what I did...I struggled with labels.  How I wasn't "this" I wasn't "that" I'm not like "them"...Then I got honest about ONE thing and faced it:..*Alcohol + Me = Undesired Consequences*..I decided to eliminate alcohol associated consequences from my life...I went to meetings and immediately found people who understood what I was experiencing...I got sober.  I live sober and happy.
