I need someone to help me get sober. I don't need someone handing me links to resources that talk about how I do it I can get those in my own. I just need a person who can kind of stick with me and help through it at least the beginning of it. Someone I can PM when I am struggling hard or just to talk it all out. I can't go to AA personal reasons. I don't have time for any kind of rehab or assistance here in town. I could use a buddy though. Just someone to help through the first few steps. I really need the help of anyone is willing.

Well only you can decide if you REALLY want to be sober. You have to want it ONLY for the fact that you are doing it for you... and ONLY you. With that being said hit me up I'm a (sober) alcoholic with experience (professionally) in addiction and psychology. Oh and I'm 28 if that matters. 
Posting the way you are feeling right now is a huge step. The strength and resolve of this this sub is awesome! Please come here often and let us know what is going on. The key to success is 'don't drink today'. Join us in not drinking today!
I highly suggest you can find someone to help you in person. If you can't do AA how about S.M.A.R.T? There's a live chat on the right side of the sub you can use as well. I'd be happy to talk to you if you need PM me whenever you want. Best of luck stay strong. 
Chat (see sidebar) greatly helped me.
