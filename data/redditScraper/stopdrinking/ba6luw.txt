It's surreal to me that I've made it to 180 days. I used to look at people who were where I am now and it seemed so far away and like such an amazing achievement. Now that I've done it then I wonder why I thought it would be so hard. I definitely have had moments in the past 180 days where I came very close to picking up a drink at least at first. Things that have helped me is telling myself "I can do that tomorrow if I still want to but not today" remembering that I've never regretted NOT drinking remembering regretting doing it times before and that it wasn't as enjoyable as I thought it would be taking Antabuse off and on (especially in the beginning) and getting a sponsor and promising myself to call her first if I decided to drink because if I've made up my mind then I can still do it after that phone call. She reminded me of some things I told her that changed my mind even though I had already decided I was going to try to moderate again..I used to not be able to stay sober for a week. I've struggled with this for years and slipped up too many times to count. If I can do it you can too. It might sound cliche but just take it a day at a time. IWNDWYT.
