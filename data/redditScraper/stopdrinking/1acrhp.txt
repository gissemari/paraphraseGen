i'm mostly posting this as a reference for those just starting out. i remember (barely) when i was in the early days i had a lot of questions like "how hard is it" "what do i do?" "how long before i feel normal again?" "but i have all these EXTRA problems that make me drink because I am special and different and my life is like way harder than anyone else's what about THAT?" .everyone is different but here's my synopsis. for the record i am 28/m drank heavily for like 7 years made several attempts to quit before this one and i don't go to AA ..    so the first few weeks pretty much unilaterally suck. i didn't experience any severe withdrawal symptoms but i definitely had major anxiety wanted to alternately maim silence or tearfully spoon anything that spoke or moved couldn't pay attention to anything felt like shit sweated profusely .    then it got a little easier but i still pretty much had to seclude myself from other people especially if they were drinking .    after about a month i started rediscovering all of the things in my life that i had been neglecting due to drinking and being hungover- "oh hey i actually like doing some stuff!" so that was cool .    after about 3 months this whole sobriety thing was getting pretty old and latent personal issues started cropping up again reminding me why i spent so much time trying to escape from them with booze. this was a rough patch and i almost caved. i know 90 days is a common relapse danger zone and i'd gone through that before and ended up right back where i was so that was pretty much the only thing that kept me going. that and i finally starting shitting normally again which was a fucking miracle. .     once i got over that hump things started to level out. i still get cravings but i'm used to them and have enough practice dealing with them that they aren't as difficult to manage anymore. more annoying than debilitating. i still struggle with the social aspect of booze since pretty much all of my friends drink. sometimes it means i hang out less and spend more time doing my own shit. after going out to bars sober a few times i don't really associate bar scenes with some amazing time that i am missing out on anymore. its more like "oh i used to have fun there when i was 21... glad i don't do that anymore though." .ok well i have to go take a normal solid non-horrifying crap now so its time to wrap this up. hope it was helpful!
