Yeah I'm a Halloween baby.  I (32M) have fond memories of my 21st...most of my good friends were out of town or working but my best friend was free and we hung out at his place watching horror movies and getting blitzed on tequila and god knows what else.  I knew little about the disastrous road my life would follow for almost the entire next decade...A near-death experience (2012) a rocky mid-20s life and a period of relapse-triggered homelessness (April 2017) later I decided to get serious about sobriety.  I always knew I had a problem I just didn't care until this point.  Depression and addiction are a killer combo.  Sobriety hasn't always been easy though at this point I've been through enough booze-induced hell I think I've had an easier time than most for these 500+ days; I'm intimately familiar with the living nightmare my life will become if I decide to pick up the bottle again and also with what's caused me to relapse in the past...It's always been a pattern.  I can only go so long without feeling any joy out of life before I return to the tried-and-true path to feeling happiness that involves having some drinks.  Anhedonia is supposed to be a transient symptom for recovering addicts; a very good therapist I was seeing early this year said as much and they usually expect to see improvement on this front from addicts who've been clean for one year...Not so with me.  Even with well over 500 days sober at this point I can't remember the last time I felt happiness that wasn't induced by a substance.  Maybe I never have.  Now by all accounts my life is stuck in a rut (a story ten years in the making); a sad little creature living a sad little life in the corner of his mother's apartment despairingly lonely.  It's only marginally better than what my life would be if I was still boozing...Sorry if this wasn't the uplifting story you might've been expecting.  I guess it's important to remember not all sobriety stories are happy ones.  I've noticed for a lot of people it seems the earnest support of their family and friends seems to die out or at least lessen in intensity after that initial choice to be sober and the immediate consequences surrounding it (interventions/jailtime/rehab/etc).  Even in AA everyone who's been around the tables awhile knows eliminating booze is rarely enough to get your life back to the place you'd like it to be and sometimes the damage it caused is more permanent than people may realize.  Sobriety only gives you a "second chance" in the most basic sense of the term; you get a second chance at life by stopping the passive suicide of drinking yourself to death.  When it comes to other areas of life you may very well never get to take another shot.  Better adjust those goalposts down a notch...Anyways Happy Halloween and as always I will not drink with you tonight.

Happy birthday! Thanks for sharing your experience. It's a helpful reminder that eliminating booze isn't always a stand-alone cure.  I hope the next year is better than your last  and that your birthday wishes come true!
