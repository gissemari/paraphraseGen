100 days today!  It feels pretty amazing.  Though my personal life is still a mess with the family and all  this is something I can be proud of.   It gets easier to see myself never drinking again but it's still a struggle.  Mostly regret for not doing this sooner and waiting until it's all about to fall apart as motivation to get sober.  I have to keep fighting the good fight.  Nothing about my current situation will be made better by drinking.   Here's to another sober day!  ..IWNDWYT
