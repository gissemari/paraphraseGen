I've been sober since 3/1...A friend invited me to karaoke tonight and I LOVE karaoke. The only issue is that I normally put away 6 drinks if we're there for 4 hours. ..I want to challenge myself early and show I can do it but I also don't think I'm ready for this unless I get MAJOR support from my friend. (Messaged them about it and how I likely wasn't up for going unless he can think of a way to help me not crave booze.)..I'm also making a list of other things that have been going well (outside of not having a job) since not drinking..-Lost 15# with nothing but following hunger.-Meal prepping is easier for me to reheat and enjoy..-Made appointments I would never have made when drinking.-Feel like I have more time to do whatever.-Looking forward to new hobbies (I like cooking so the new meal prep thing is helping but I also want to Branch out.)..Update: He knows he can't go and not drink so he's worried he'll be a bad influence. Okie dokie making applesauce scones and biscotti tonight it is!
