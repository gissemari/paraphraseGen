I ended up drinking Thursday Friday and Saturday. My biggest struggle is that I've made drinking a habit when it comes to weekends. I believe part of it is boredom but the part that bugs me the most is I get the urge to drink when I'm playing a video game or watching a film on my computer which is also what I use to quell being bored. I don't know if anyone else has made it a habit like I have but it is daunting to say the least. ..Today I am putting a stop to my drinking and I want to reach out and say I look forward to not drinking with everyone today. This is going to be a new journey for me and I am looking forward as to what lies ahead. I managed to stay completely sober for 14 weeks for a school project and I felt incredible. I'm looking forward to doing that again and not stopping. Thank you all for listening to my small rant. I needed to say something since I don't really have anyone else to say it to. I hope this also falls within the rules of posting. I really appreciate this sub and I look forward to becoming a part of the community! :-)
