Inpatient detox is not an option for me. I have a couple Xanax to try to keep me stable (I know I know it's just a few to keep me alive for the next couple of days!) and just bought a blood pressure/pulse monitor. I've only been relapsed about a week after two months of sobriety but I'm already sweating. ..Does anyone know what blood pressure/ pulse numbers I should be watching out for? How high is considered "dangerous?"

There is a lot of us ex-drunks here but there isn't a lot of people here qualified to give medical advice. For basic blood pressure numbers etc. google could either be your friend or a bad idea....(I tend to think google hurts more people than it helps when it comes to medical issues)
As far as I can tell the fears of severe/dangerous withdrawal effects tend to be overblown. I think we often focus on them as an excuse to not quit (I know I did)...That said if you are concerned you should check in with a doctor. After all I'm just some guy on the internet.
You can usually go to your local Rite Aid CVS Walgreens and have your BP taken --they'll tell you it it's high..And not trying to be a smart-ass but the instruction book that came with your monitor does give guidelines on BP..Good Luck and know these symptoms will pass!
I doubt anyone is going to give you medical advice here other than to go see a doctor. If you're worried enough to have Xanax in one hand and a blood pressure monitor in the other maybe you should drop both and go to the emergency room. Sorry to sound glib but this is nothing to mess around with. ..FULL DISCLOSURE: I flew solo when I detoxed and I wish I hadn't. Don't make this any worse for yourself than you have to.
