You are not alone just being on this sub will give you the strength to reach out and rebuild. Im in the UK and don't have any experience of your immediate situation and I hope you can the immediate help you need. I do know that sometimes our lowest points can bring about great change and no matter how bleak things may seem now the future does not have to be. Thoughts with you and good luck
Gosh that is pretty scarey stuff. It's a long time since anything really bad happened as a result of my drinking as I only drink at home now. But in the past the worst events triggered the longest periods of sobriety. So awful as it is I hope the memory of (or lack of) this event will strengthen your resolve to stay sober. ..Sending you an internet hug and resolving to not drink with you today. xx
