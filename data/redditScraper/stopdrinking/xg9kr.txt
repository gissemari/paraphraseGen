hi all. i've been grappling with my alcohol use/abuse for some time. i'm 28 and most of my friends drink. a lot of them have chilled out a lot though and are able to and prefer to drink moderately now. sometimes i can too but there are nights when i get wasted forget shit and wake up hungover. ultimately i've never been violent driven drunk or done anything particularly stupid hurtful or dangerous so the idea of getting "fucked up" once in awhile doesn't bother me conceptually but i feel like for me drinking daily even if it is usually just a couple (which takes effort on my part to control) is having a negative overall impact on my life in terms of my memory energy level health motivation interpersonal relationships etc. .so i want to stop drinking. ..i've stopped before for some weeks after setting the goal of "taking a break for two weeks" and whatnot with relatively little difficulty. i knew i would probably want a beer around 5 and i did and there was beer in the house but i had enough self control to just not drink it. .in the back of my mind though i knew that once that two weeks was up it would still be there waiting for me. ..i'm not sure how mentally prepared i am to accept that i "will never drink again" though ultimately that is probably what needs to happen. .i grew up with an alcoholic single mother who i saw sober up for a month or two to "lose weight" and then relapse countless times over a period of many years. she is still drinking and we haven't spoken in 3 years for a variety of reasons a lot of them stemming from her alcoholic behavior some of which i have begun to notice subtly emerging in myself which is a major red flag for me... so i guess i know in my heart that "taking a break" even for some months even for some years is unlikely to miraculously allow me to enjoy alcohol like a responsible person but perhaps using the "taking a break" logic as a tool is ok for the initial phase of stopping? thoughts on this? ..also i'm gay and drinking is a pretty huge part of gay culture. basically "sober" is a euphemism for "boring" in the gay scene. obviously that's a stereotype and whatnot but it is a difficult thing to reconcile. i can't imagine going on a date without booze involved. i am grinding my teeth just thinking about how awkward that would be. are there any other homos here how the fuck do you manage? ..alright well that's my introduction. i guess today is day 1 one for me. i'll probably be here at 5 cursing myself for making this "stupid resolution" to the internet earlier today. and not drinking because i know that if i don't follow through with my stupid resolution i will end up with much bigger problems than awkward dates... like ruining all of my relationships and lying to myself about how it is everybody else's fault that i'm a lonely old queen with liver failure and no money. sigh. damn you foresight. ..so how does this chat room thing i hear about work? i'll probably want to come be boring there this evening. .    .

Please do come to the chatroom.  It's fun and occasionally bizarre...&gt; basically "sober" is a euphemism for "boring" in the gay scene...I'd bet that this is only true among the drinking community.  The sober gay community probably has a different way of looking at it.
Welcome!  And congratulations on taking the first and hardest step...You're going to find this sub is a great place to work through your recovery.  Post as much as you need to we're all the same here in one way at least.
