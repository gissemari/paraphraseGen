Hi there sd.  I'm a mess and I need to just vent a little. First my badge is way wrong I need to request a new one.  I had over 100 days sober until this weekend when I had a planned relapse. I went camping with a friend and I convinced myself that I could have a bottle without hurting anything. Of course that was a lie.  I proceeded to drink away the whole weekend and had to call in sick to work this morning because I'm hungover. I'm afraid this disease is going to kill me.  I'm just plain scared. ..But I'm not going to drink today. I have group therapy tonight. I am both dreading and looking forward to telling them about my relapse.  Thank you to everyone on here for your support.

Being honest was one of the keys to my continuing sobriety.  Tell you group the truth and you may get some good advice.  For today just don't drink.  Good luck.
You can't be that afraid it's going to kill you. If you were you wouldn't have had a "planned relapse" whatever the hell that is.  Like if I had a peanut allergy I sure as heck wouldn't purposely eat PB&amp;J sandwiches while lamenting my situation...If you want to stop drinking you should not plan relapses for yourself.  Planning a relapse is the opposite of not drinking. I never imagined that iI'd one day have to explain that to someone. 
Welcome back. Good job getting to 100 days and not letting this turn into a month long bender. Telling your group about the relapse will be tough but it will also be a great step back to honesty and sobriety. Please keep us posted and I wish you the best of luck.
The decision not to drink TODAY is precisely how I got to this day in my sobriety.  
Welcome back!
