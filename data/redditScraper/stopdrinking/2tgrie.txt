My actual time is 2 days but I havent had them reset my badge yet. I am however scared of a seizure. I went a month without drinking then 2 weeks then i relapsed with a friend and got drunk. I believe i drank the equivalent of 12 beers...I am currently not having any other symptoms besides this anxiety. I do have some lorazepam that my Dr gave me to help me out. I really hope that this fear gives me the added tenacity I need to stay sober.

I doubt you will have a seizure. Given what you've said you'll likely experience some symptoms such as anxiety but they will lessen every day. Follow the direction of your doctor. ..Fear may get you sober but it can't keep you sober. It takes more than that. What helped me was having a therapist and going to support group meetings. Going it alone rarely works long-term. Take care and stay in touch.
I was hospitalized for stress and alcohol related heart issues and thought I might die. Scared me right straight. I would sober up!..Within days I was drinking vodka because in my alcoholic mind it was healthier than beer.....Fear only lasts a short time.You have to work on a bigger picture one day at a time.
