[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy Hump Day! What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** I am trying to change a lifelong habit of completely disregarding my own needs. I struggle with feeling selfish when I consider what would be nice for me. But then I recently realized that being unselfish means being good to the community and I am a part of that community! That means I should be good to everyone including myself! This was actually a major breakthrough for me...**Struggle:** I went to get an infusion for my MS medication. While the nurse was setting up the IV I told her about how I was following a well-known diet for MS and how well it was working for me.  No gluten no dairy and no alcohol  I told her proudly but she quickly said  Well not having alcohol isn't really a big part of that diet.  It's so discouraging when even healthcare professionals don't think it's important not to imbibe poison...**General:**  Be yourself. Everybody else is taken.  -- Oscar Wilde
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph: I went out with a new group of friends for my birthday. I've known these people since February but haven't made it to many of their meetings due to urgent life stuff and lots of social anxiety. But I went and I wasn't my usual closed off quiet self. I talked and laughed and everyone liked me. :) This has been the most difficult year and I think it was the first time I really smiled all year. ..Struggle: I'm living with my mother as she navigates a serious illness and it's taken a toll. She's verbally abusive manipulative over-dramatic dishonest and won't cooperate with her treatment plan. It's hard to see her this way and it's hard to be around her as she has no respect for my adulthood or boundaries or feelings. I'm actually having to think about whether I am willing to continue caring for her or not. It feels sooo selfish to admit that but I also know that my sobriety and sanity depend on avoiding/leaving toxic relationships. I am way too sensitive to them. ..General: A friend in my AA program had a relapse. It's hard because he and I came into the rooms around the same time and he had over a year. He's okay but I was so worried. I'm happy to have seen him tonight. Y'all... if you happen to relapse just know you are loved and it doesn't change anything.  
Triumph: I'm lucky enough to live with my mother in law rent free and I contribute to a 401(k); health savings account; save $200/month and pay $800 a month to my student loans.  I have a fairly modest salary but I'm really making use of it for the first time in my life...Struggle: I had a big promotion a few months ago and I'm still learning so much.  It's a complicated job and I don't know enough to judge if I'm falling behind.  ..General: I haven't really been thinking about recovery lately.  For a long time it was a big part of my life but it's faded into the background.  I'm not thinking about drinking either it feels more like I'm finally used to feeling good.  
I don't have a lot to share i'm afraid. I'm going on 10 days and had my first counsel yesterday which went fine. Feeling disciplined...About Oscar Wilde I feel the importance of being Earnest. 
Triumph: I'm still sober. I have been having very real issues with my brain trying to convince me I can moderate. I was thisclose to ordering a glass of wine when having dinner with a coworker last week. But I know better mostly from the sharing everyone does on this sub regarding relapses. I had a drinking dream last night and I was so so sad that I'd had a drink. Then I woke up...and am so incredibly happy that my subconscious has reinforced that sober is what's for me...Struggle: seemingly never ending custody and legal issues surrounding a domestic violence incident a couple of years ago. The person who hurt me has always taken advantage of my difficulty setting boundaries and has recently done so again and in a way that puts my child in mild risk. And it was blessed by a judge. Feels real yucky...General: I was pointed to a new podcast (I do love my podcasts for running etc) called Warrior Mind. I love it so far. I have lots of work to do on myself and I can see this helping me.
Triumph: I finally organized my nail polish today and enjoyed doing it. Nail art was my primary hobby for a long time but for the past six months or so I just had it all thrown into a Bag in my closet never caring enough to find a better storage solution or paint my nails. I think I'm regaining interest in hobbies and well life in general...Struggle: I'm being pressured by people in AA to "take this seriously" by which they mean go to more meetings. I went to two today and I didn't enjoy the second one. My daily meeting is something I always look forward to and I'm upset when I can't go but two in a day apparently makes me feel like I did nothing but focus on not drinking all day. ..General: I'm trying to find a new job that isn't in a bar because duh. I'm nervous but very hopeful.
Triumph: Getting past the urges to use tapering as an excuse to have jussttt a little bit...Struggle: Moodiness and not wanting to get up in the morning...General: Anyone have any advice for these damn nightsweats and nightmares? I just woke up and I'm soaked again :(
Triump: Tomorrow (its only 11:04pst at the moment I'm writing this) marks a tie for the longest I have ever gone without drinking alcohol in almost a decade. I only see up from here. I am more productive at work more alert excerise often (down 10lbs thus far) and my depression/anxiety has pretty much subsided after the week mark... I haven't felt this great in a long time...Struggle: My friend group isn't as supportive.. my parents neither (I think they don't believe I can do it) they still say oh well just moderate yourself and so forth. I know deep down I can't do that but oddly enough I have zero desire or temptation to drink when the pressure is on anymore... and it's not that I'm being reclusive at all.. I even attended my friends bday party last weekend being the only sober guy in a group of 35! Had a blast! ..General: My goal when I started this wasn't to quit forever. It was actually a sober October dare. I found /sd after day 5 or 6 and after reading people's stories and reflecting on my life really put things into perspective. As the days moved on and I continued to be sober my life improved.. day by day...After 24 days now sober I'm pushing myself to now the 100 day challenge. I've always been a guy who is motivated by challenges and 100 seems like an achievable goal for now I hope to contribute and keep reading along to everyone's stories as we continue this journey together.  
Triumph: I reached my weight goal this week; down 13 kg/~26 lbs...Struggle: I'm on the 11th month of a sick leave (unrelated) and will have to return to work in another month. Aside from the health issues I don't want to return to my old job working with addicts (yeah). Finding a new employer who doesn't make note of a long term sick leave isn't easy...General: I've finally begun drawing the sketches for the children's book I'm working on. That's a relief.
Triumph = I've made it through the first 2 days of sobriety. Which from previous experience are normally the hardest and I'm feeling somewhere close to my normal positive self!..Struggle = the last 2 days to get back on the sobriety train but I feel like I am through the hardest part! Boom!..General = I've learned from my recent relapse to not let myself get hungry thirsty and tired. It's a dangerous combination. I will also recognise my cravings early and rather than try to hide from them I will come on here and share how I'm feeling...I will not drink today! 
Good: i'm three weeks away from being completely antidepressants free. I'm losing weight thanks to my diet. I've been praised by my family and doctor for my incredible life improvements. And i'm almost 100 days sober..Struggle: i'm really overworked and stressed out lately. I've had moments when all the stuff I have to do (all the house chores and cooking for my parents on top of working 10hrs and selfstudy of japanese) feels like it's going to crush me and I paralyze procrastinating ina very unpleasant way. It upsets me bc it's a behavior tied to my anxiety which is tied to my drinking and even tho I haven't had cravings i'm terrified of caving in a moment of weakness..General: social media is an actual bane for me lately. The internet is genuinely toxic. I try to use only job sites (I work on the internet) and SD but I slip sometimes and get caught just making myself more upset. :(
Triumph: Came back to this sub requested badge reset. Feel positive...Struggle: worried about going to work drinks tomorrow ..General: just got through a really busy workload
Triumph: Have started to go running in the morning. Not much but it's a start...Struggle: Sleep is shot to sh*t struggle to fall asleep sleep badly wake up super early and tired. ..General: Yesterday I was angry a.f. Every trivial problem caused me to fume and rage. Even shouted at my lovely dog for having muddy paws. Not good need to work this stuff out.
Triumph: Made it thus far with very little desire to even have a drink.  My resolve seems to be sticking for now.  The upcoming week may be a bit rough--Halloween has always been a big "party" time for me.  Fortunately (or un?) I don't have any real plans thus far...Struggle: Have had what I believe is tendonitis in my knee for about a month now (I run. Lots.). Haven't been able to get a real run in in a while and I really miss it.  Fortunately the lack of drinking means I'm not gaining a horrible amount of weight?!  Also my psychiatrist's rates just skyrocketed...looks like it's time to find a new one...General: I got a promotion and am in general feeling pretty great lately :).  Many thanks to this community.  I wish my sister would find her way here.
Triumph: Told the most important person what I really feel and how I no longer want to be in the sort of relationship we currently are where I feel like a 2nd hand safety net of sorts. Agreed but didnt come to any real conclusion. She needs a bit of time and both are extremely scared of the outcome no matter what happens. At least I know the ball is rolling for real...Struggle: Getting myself to call and book a therapy session. Extremely uncomfortable with how my mind works and its related to above as well...General: Generally feel pretty good work is easier than ever started reading the naked mind and will try to incorporate the same thoughts against my nicotine addiction. Started taking L-Theanine and it feels like it helps the quality of sleep and general mood a lot.
Triumph: I went to work although I slept maybe 4 hours last night and felt totally done already in the morning. ..Struggle: I don't know if this is PAWS or just my issues but I feel like everything is a struggle at the moment. I'm stressed out to the point that I'm super wired and angry 24/7 and find myself harder and harder to control it. I can't remember the last night I slept more than 6 hours. The only things I find some release from this constant pressure in my head and whole body (literally) is when I'm climbing or playing a video game. This is the feeling I've had every single time before a relapse. I'm scared that I can't find healthy ways to deal with myself. ..General: I'm seeing a doctor next week and then hopefully will get my therapy process started. I don't really know how to feel about it. 
Triumph: my skin has been really good for the last two days which is amazing because it's been awful non stop for the past 20 years. It's hormonal rather than alcohol related but I'm sure not having 3 bottles of wine per week isn't hurting. Also this month I gave up dairy which I think plays a big part in my hormonal acne...Struggle: I hate soda of all kinds but since quitting drinking I'm substituting hardcore with coca cola. Two cans yesterday one right after the other. Blegh. But I was really desperate for a drink yesterday so I'm just glad it didn't go that way..General: I'm trying to find a book series that's kind of like the Gilmore Girls any recommendations? 
Triumph: I'm telling people I'm sober and they're saying back  I know! You already told me!  Which slowly means my that one day soon nobody will offer me alcohol anymore!..Struggle: I need to see a dentist because I think I'm grinding my teeth and getting migraines? But I really hate the dentist...General: Tucker my standard poodle thanks you all for helping his mommy stay sober! She's so much more fun now and likes to go on walks and doesn't lay in bed or throw up all weekend ;)
Triumph: Exchanged first of weekly emails with my daughter today shared happy news &amp; pictures - I am so freaking happy that we will again be having regular contact  ..Struggle:  Trying to understand *Self Will* &amp; it's ability to lead me to dumb decisions (slip-up) &amp; that I am still smoking cigarettes - I do believe in my own higher power But I just don't trust enough to let go of my sense of control...... *Confused but working on it!*..General: I am starting to feel more comfortable having "real" conversations with people &amp; I am re-connecting with one of my neighbours who has a healthy lifestyle &amp; a great sense of humour! We might be going on walks together :)..I *Love* this Oscar Wilde quote /u/sfgirlmary &amp; thank you for hosting What's Up Wednesday every week I really appreciate you for doing so :)
*Triumph* I went to work last night and got multiple compliments on looking good especially about my eyes.  I think it was partly about being happy with myself though that I hold people's gaze longer.  No matter what I'm doing the right thing right now...*Struggle* I have a test today.  My teacher is odd and not compassionate.  I'm struggling to rise above her attitude and also feel really bad for her as I think she has the beginning of Parkinson's Disease.  I'm a nurse and there are a couple EMT's in my class and we have exchanged looks of deep concern as she seems so unsteady at times..*General* I'm feel tired but good.  Great kids husband who gets me goofy dogs and chickens laying eggs daily.
Triumph: Got to 1 month today after falling off the wagon from May to late Sept. I really got to 'revisit' drinking and only confirmed yes it is time to move on. I needed the hiccup I guess. ..Struggle: My career is a source of huge frustration. For a variety of reasons I need a change. Facing it clear-headed and not medicating with drinking makes it so much better. I can focus on what I want actions to take and have confidence to challenge myself vs. escape with getting drunk on weekends. ..General: I think my relapse wasn't helped by dropping off in daily visits to SD. Whether it's 2 minutes or an hour I now know SD is something I need. Sobriety as a shared experience is much better than solo! 
Thank you for hosting ... ..Triumph: Sleep is very good anxiety almost non-existent mood mostly stable. No desire to drink and almost to 90 days. Kids both in pretty good places at the moment and hubby and I are a happy pair.  ..Struggle: Work challenging right now but I am in there swinging. Energy food exercise and weight not the greatest ... to be ironed out over time. ..General: Anxious about upcoming family reunion cruise. Not worried about drinking but the FOOD ... and possible family drama. I will need to draw on my practice taking things one day at a time. In fact I should do that now. 
Triumph: I've added meditation to my nightly routine. It's only been a couple days so getting my mind to shut up for just a couple minutes is a big success for me :) ..Struggle: My sister in law was convicted of first degree murder recently and testified against her "boyfriend" last week. She's been in jail for nearly as long as I've been sober but it's something I've really avoided thinking about or feeling emotions over. With the trial and hearing about her testimony I'm not able to put off dealing with my thoughts on it anymore. I have so many conflicting feelings going on and it's not been easy. ..General: Today you are you that is truer than true. There is no one alive that is you-er than you! - Dr. Seuss
**Triumph** I'm at 17 days which is the longest I've gone without drinking....well I suppose since I started legally drinking! .I've been so clear headed at work I've got so much done! Only 4 things outstanding on my To-do list which feels bloody amazing! .I made it through my first concert completely sober last week. I didn't think I'd have much fun but it was awesome! And I didn't have to keep missing songs to go to the bathroom! The whole concert is crystal clear in my memory and will be forever :)...**Struggle** Still struggling with my mum. She seems personally offended that I'm quitting drinking. She keeps calling me boring and trying to get me to have a glass of wine or whatever. I don't think she really understands just how much I struggled with my drinking habits. It'll take time but I think she'll eventually come around. 
Triumph - I never "officially" told my family I was stopping drinking.  I live out of state anyway.  Well I was home this weekend.  My Mom offered me a beer and I told her I wasn't drinking.  She offered again later.  I said no again.  The third time she said it was fine but asked why I was not drinking and I said because I can't control it.  The next day my sister was there and said she wanted a glass of wine but didn't want to open the bottle just for her.  She asked if I wanted some.  I said no and the bottle wasn't opened..Struggle - This will be my first sober weekend at home..General - I am proud of myself!
Happy Wednesday!!  ..*TRIUMPH*  ..Finishing out a big project for work that I'm pretty proud of. I'm a new engineer (man that still sounds so weird!) at this amazing wedding tech start up in nyc and I love it. It's the perfect job. I have no idea how lucky I am to have stumbled into it.  Best part about it: despite being a tech start up the drinking culture isn't nearly as bad. I'm not sure if it's because there's a higher ratio of women to men or because our smallish tech team of 15 or so has a few adults with kids or something else. People drink but it's not the early 20's fueled mania I see at other companies. My fianc  works for Tumblr and often regales me with the antics his co workers get into. But my job is a bit more moderate. Which I love.  ..*STRUGGLE*   ..Not really alcohol related but I've been trying to curb my tendency to self deprecate. Why do I do that? A little is fine like a bit of salt into a stew but I do it to the extent that it's like I'm trying to convince people I'm not capable. I think in my heart of hearts I feel like a fraud and a fake at my job. Like I'm one project away from everyone finding out I don't know what I'm doing and I'll be asked politely but firmly to leave. So I make jokes about being stupid like a person in the top floor of a burning building waving a blanket out of an open  window. HERE I AM! I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING! PLEASE SOMEONE FIGURE IT OUT! CALL ME OUT SO I CAN STOP TRYING TO LIVE UNDER THE PRESSURE THIS HUGE LIE IS BUILDING!   ..I'll get there. I started a tally for not drinking on my phone (apps called just that Tally) and it's counting my days without alcohol (as well as my badge) and I'm going to add one for self deprecatory remarks.  
**Triumph:** I've been working through parts of But s' "Feeling Good Workbooks." Good stuff and I'm glad a friend suggested it...**Struggle:** I'm letting other self-care slip. It's catching up. I need to get back on top of taking care of myself...**General:** "Fuck this S.H.I.T. (self-help inhibiting thought)" is something I learned at one of the first meetings I went to.
Triumph: a few days ago i posted about figuring out a solution to a problem in my sleep and i found out it worked this morning! It was to do with my research (grad student) and has given me a lot of clarity on my next steps. If i hadn't stopped drinking there's no way I'd be approaching things so clearly. So I'm in a great moodwhich i needed after yesterday     .    ...Struggle: caved and had a cigarette last night. yesterday was stressful was venting with peers and they were saying how much they're drinking to deal with things in that half-joking half-serious way. at the time it made me feel confident in my choice to quit. but i guess it planted some seed in my mind like  well they're all doing it it's normal  one of those rationalisations wilfully ignoring the huge differences between us. On my way home it was all i could think about. I needed groceries but decided not to go to the shop because i couldn't trust myself not to buy alcohol. So i made a makeshift meal of random things i had left and kind of white knuckled it. Literally just spent all night focusing on not drinking. Couldn't sleep. Ended up smoking around 1am. I had thrown my vape away because it's too easy for me just to continually use it but kept an  emergency  cigarette for a situation like this. With the idea that it would be better than going to buy a pack and chain smoking. And actually after having one i didn't want another. I woke up feeling much better i'm not struggling with craving alcohol or nicotine right now. Frustrated that i will now have to go through the nicotine withdrawal process again and not confident i'll make it very long after only lasting a week. But i know for me it's less pressing than staying sober. Like i said i'm feeling good today will just try again.    .    ...General: I say this a lot but i am so thankful for this sub! Appreciate all of you.    .    .IWNDWYT
**Triumph:** I'm (mostly) not sick anymore! Hooray! I'm still a little sniffle-y but otherwise I feel much better than before...**Struggle:** I can't stop thinking about this girl I work with. I haven't been head-over-heels into someone in ages and I forgot how exciting mind-consuming and exhausting it can be. I'm pretty sure she isn't into me though. Oh well. ..**General:** I keep listening to [King George's songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NOjkmkanrc) from Hamilton. They're so damn funny!
T:  Not acting on my emotions I got super pissed off at my family(Dad and Sisters) on Sunday and held it together...S:  I've been having some serious headaches the past few days...G:  Damn I'm a wierdo.  Alcohol really helped me fit in in social situations.   Now I just try to avoid social situations.  Working out pretty well so far.
Struggle: This is really hard. Start of day 3 and wondering if it gets better. Sooo wanting a shot before work today as I have plain water in my bottles again so once there stuck...Struggle: All my home hiding places with shots of vodka. Threw away 4 last night. That was not easy...I will try not to drink with you today...
T: I'd been in a bit of a rut lately working hard but missing something. Life was feeling like a grind. I was a bit down and couldn't really figure out why. This past weekend I got a video game that has snapped me out of it. I was missing simple mindless fun. ..S:  Now probably need to address my  social  meter which isn't exactly in the red just needs attention. 
**Triumph:** Started to keep up with running the past few weeks and I'm almost up past a 5k every time I run. ..**Struggle:** I have almost no motivation to do anything. Just this weird feeling of ennui that I can't shake off. I'm feeling very anti-social at the moment and might just need some hermit time...**General:** Watched Mindhunter on Netflix and really enjoyed it. In the middle of reading House of Leaves for the second time.
Triumph: I had to start antibiotics and they told me if I drink any alcohol it will render them useless. A month ago this would have been absolutely doable but incredibly inconvenient. When the nurse said it I just thought  no problem . ..Struggle: I'm still really upset with myself for having margaritas on Saturday and angry that I feel like I'm starting over (resetting my badge especially hurt for some reason). I don't know why I did it except I was uncomfortable at the party I was at and stressed with school. I didn't even get buzzed enough to escape any of it not that it would have been worth it if I had. Some guy picked me up against my wishes and fell on me and I felt really violated but also like it was my fault for being there in the first place. ........
TRIUMPH: 32 days and I'm now confident that I won't drink at home at work or ..STRUGGLE: My closest friends still don't know that I've quit drinking and I haven't hung out with any of them since over a month ago. I've got good friends and they'll respect my decision but I'm still nervous about it...GENERAL: Found my Hall &amp; Oates hat. Hadn't seen it in weeks.
Triumph: 10 F'n weeks!.Struggling to not get angry over issues with my SO..General: "Be yourself they can't take that away from you" - Coleman in Trading Places.
Triumph: I've had nothing but accolades from my charge nurses for the work I do as a nurse assistant. The Director of HR calls me "a beacon in a world of darkness." I care about my residents. That's why I do what I do...Struggle: Trying to make ends meet on $11/hour no health insurance (US) needed new tires so here comes the credit card. My husband and I have been discussing moving out of this one-horse town to a more populated area with better opportunities getting better jobs and building a small house (think shipping-crate style abode) on my parents' property in the country. [My theme song.](https://youtu.be/AIOAlaACuv4)..General: I won't give up. Life has a way of kicking you when you're down. I knocked myself down and keep getting kicked but I WILL get up again. I will not drink with you today.
Do you have any favorite resources for gluten- and dairy-free recipes?..**Triumph:** I've been really great at meal planning and prepping lately...**Struggle:** Despite changing my diet I'm still struggling with congestion and energy issues. I know I need to give it more time but I want things to be better now...**General: ** It's really nice outside so I'm going to be sure to take an afternoon break to take a walk.
Love the quote!..Triumph: more secure in not drinking at the moment and seeing this as a journey of healing.  Cravings are opportunities to try to learn about the underlying issues I need to deal with...Struggle: trying to get a balance around work.  Trying to increase exercise (a real struggle!) above and beyond dog walks most days.  Trying to cut down on sugar (sigh)..General:  The most fundamental aggression to ourselves the most fundamental harm we can do to ourselves is to remain ignorant by not having the courage and the respect to look at ourselves honestly and gently.  Pema Chodron
Got with my old AA sponsor and his sponsor hit a morning meet and they took me to breakfast.  Just truly wonderful people.  6 years away from the tables and sober friends and that is too long.  Great day.  I will not be drinking with you all today.
Triumph: I hiked up a mountain today 5th time in 12 days! After years of not even wanting to go outside when it's nice and sunny out I now find myself loving going outside even in the rain...I am a participant in my own life again and it is incredible..Struggle: I still get anxiety attacks here and there and when I am stressed or anxious I still think about drinking. Thankfully it is just a thought and not an action though. I will overcome this. One day at a time..General: "Please pay attention very carefully because this is the truest thing a stranger will ever say to you: In the face of such hopelessness as our eventual unavoidable death there is little sense in not at least TRYING to accomplish all your wildest dreams in life." - Kevin Smith
6 years 2 days since I gave up drinking...For the first time I admitted to two people that I was an alcoholic this week. It literally took me 6 years of living a sober life for me to realize just how bad of a problem I had in the past. I didn't want to admit it. I am finally coming to terms with it. I was profoundly ashamed of my behavior when I was drinking but I figured as long as I wasn't an "alcoholic" it wasn't that bad...So today I'm admitting it to all of you...
**Triumph:** I got a client who was very late to pay up in full before they wanted to. This would have been an ideal excuse in the past.....**Struggle:** Being busy with work is making it difficult to get out on my bike as often as I'd like. Tomorrow should be better in this regard though!..**General:** "When I control it I don't enjoy it and vice versa"
I'll not drink today.
.
Triumph: I am on day 4 and have a lot of resolve right now. I want to get my life in order and am committed to making a positive change. ..Struggle: I'm dealing with depression unemployment and poverty. I'm smoking a lot hoping to tone that down as I lose the cravings. ..I will not drink today! 
Triumph: made it through my conference without drinking! We get free beer tickets and happy hours galore. I made it through without drinking while still seeing old colleagues and exploring a new city!..Struggle: I'm very tired. I seem to be sleeping way too much. I also am taking a grad school break and need to find a job...General: I'm very happy. I havent felt this happy for a year. I really believe if I'm trying my best things will work out :)
Triumph: I had a belated bday dinner with family today we went out to one of our favorite restaurants Old Spaghetti Factory. Normally I'd have two glasses of wine before the food even came out. NOT TODAY POISON! I also discovered that club soda/tonic water with a couple of limes squeezed in tastes awesome even without vodka. I stopped on the way home and picked up 8 liters of tonic water and a bagful of limes ^_^...Struggle: The dreams. I know I know everyone gets them. It's a good sign! It means we're getting better more restful sleep. But I'm a Marine veteran. Ever since I got out 6 years ago I've been a consistent drinker so it's never been much of an issue. Even after two days sober my past is coming back to bite me in the ass and make this that much harder. Something I'll have to bring up in therapy I suppose...General: I've been playing some new games recently (PC) and really enjoying them. BattleRite is surprisingly fun as it's not up my normal alley and I picked up Sniper Ghost Warrior 3 on chrono.gg last week and been having a blast with that. If anyone has recommendations or want to play something together let me know!
Triumph: My parents are visiting tomorrow and I'm not worried about adding "throwing out all bottles" to my chores to do before they come. That feels so good. ..Struggle: I got a cold from my sweet baby girl (thanks daycare) so I've been frustrated with not feeling better immediately in these first few days. I know that the beginning is the roughest part anyway but my sleep is terrible I'm completely exhausted and my skin has completely erupted. I know that drinking won't make it better and I know that part of it is this damn cold (and general teaching and wife and new mom exhaustion) but it's been disheartening to the I-want-immediate-gratification part of me...General: I am absolutely devouring the Home podcast episodes in chronological order. How absolutely beautiful and wonderful they are to me right now. 
**Triumph:**  I really feel like my brain is healing.  It's hard to describe; it's not just that the mental fog is continuing to lift it's like I'm able to be more myself without struggle.  And daily things that used to wipe me mentally and emotionally are just events that I go through without a second thought now. ..**Struggle:** Got turned down for a car loan.  I'm not really surprised but I need to see if it's my income or my credit that did me in.  Finances are tight and it's tough to be patient and get through years of exams and internship before I have chance at things like my own car or living in town instead of rural life.  I need to be grateful for what I have I know but I just feel so stuck sometimes. ..**General:**  Random brain facts: There are about 100 billion neurons present in the brain. The brain is about 60% fat.
Triumph: I can now happily engage in chit chat with 10-15 people at my regular meetings. They are getting to know me and I want to get to know them. As someone who has always had HUGE social anxiety this is a big thing..Struggle: I'm trying to date (and not within the rooms). For right now it's probably still a terrible idea. Finding people who don't go  omg you don't drink?  to go on a date on is tough stuff..General: Russell Brand's take on the 12 steps is hilarious..
Hang in there. It will get better. The first weeks are tough but soon you will feel so much better. See a doctor if you start shaking.
