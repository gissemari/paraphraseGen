It's been a rough year for me. Tomorrow marks exactly one year since I admitted myself to the emergency room due to severe alcohol withdrawals. I've had my ups and my downs including my fair share of relapses throughout this time. Despite these failures I feel as though I have grown a little more into my honest sober self. With the help of SD friends family AA and SMART I will tackle this ailment head on. One day at a time. Today I will not drink.

Kudos for four days! Glad you're here.
High Five! You are doing great!
Despite relapses every day you didn't drink in the past year is a day that you didn't drink and it still counts for something.
