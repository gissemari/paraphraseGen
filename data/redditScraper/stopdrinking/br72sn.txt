**Trigger Warnings/Disclaimers:** I will be expressing irrational anger at people like many of the members of this sub. I recognize this is irrational and I think you are great people and I am proud of you but sometimes emotions are not under one's own control. ..My apologies if this isn't appropriate here but I do not know where else to post it. I have never been a big drinker. I would have about one drink every two weeks or so and sometimes have three to five at a party every few years. ..I have recently been diagnosed with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency which means I am an extremely likely candidate for liver problems. While I don't have to completely stop drinking I might have to pretty much limit it to one drink on holidays. ..I don't expect to have difficulty with the actual process of cutting back. What I need help with is not being angry.  I get angry with people I see who party and drink to get drunk because they take for granted that which I cannot have. But the big one is that I get angry at people who are successfully recovered/recovering after having been heavy drinkers. I feel like it isn't *fair* that I am in the same position as them. They got to have all that time drinking to *deserve* their problems mine was just given to me. I know this isn't right. I know that I shouldn't feel that way. everyone's struggles are their own. But I feel that anger sometimes and I don't *like* that I feel that anger. ..While part of this post is to get this off my chest and to say I am sorry to you all for how I feel (even if I don't show the anger and you never knew I had it before now) part of this post is also trying to see if this is relatable to anyone here or if anyone has suggestions on how to work on this aspect of not being able to drink as much as I used to.

Hi this is somewhat relatable to me I have celiac disease and can't eat gluten (in wheat barley and rye.) however I was happy to find out what was wrong with me and start to feel better. ..Being drunk is a lot less fun than it looks. FWIW. ..I've had other disadvantages that HAVE made me curse my genetic lot. ..This whole  luck of the draw  thing can be annoying! ..IWNDWYT
Instead of being angry why not change the narrative? Maybe be thankful that you found out about your medical issue before alcohol did any damage. Many people have medical issues that make them not be able to have certain things. Diabetics can not have sugar and it is not their fault. Some can not digest protein so they have to be on a special diet for life but they did nothing to cause this. There are kids born with a condition makes them not to be able to go out in the sun or their skin gets blistered. They have to live their whole life indoors. They did not cause this. There are many more examples I could name but no one asks for any kind of medical issue they just deal with the cards that are dealt to them. IWNDWYT
Help me understand. You maybe have 1 drink every 2 weeks...and then an event where you have 3-5 every two years? With no intention to dismiss your feelings it sounds awfully infrequent to mourn it's loss. Something that I *may* have once every two weeks is likely something I forget all about unless it's served to me. ..Correct me if I am off base but I'm wondering if your anger lies within having a disorder that impacts your liver (through presumably no fault of your own) while an entire community of people knowingly destroy theirs with potentially little permanent consequence?
