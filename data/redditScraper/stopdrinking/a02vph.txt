I m at my inlaws  for the weekend celebrating a 70th birthday. The whole family is here. By some strange occurence I happen to be put in the midst of not only one or two or three but **four** families that don t drink - those of my mother my father my wife/inlaws and my sister in law...I ve never seen one single person in all these families take a drink during a party. Not even at weddings birthdays or wakes. How is that even possible?? One year ago struggling at one week sober I attended my uncle s funeral. In the daily check-in I wrote..&gt; It s weird to think that in all my extended family - six siblings on both parents  side with lots of kids and grandkids - there have only been two known drinkers (both of them violent when drunk) and never ever a drop of alcohol in any family gathering. And then there s me...Like a blessing I got the reply..&gt; Yup and then there's you; the success story. The one that drank *way* too much and that **stopped**. Anyone can not drink when they never drink; not drinking when you drank *that* is a feat. Proud of you!..Oh yes u/everydayanewday I remember. That comment stuck. It meant the world to me and is a cornerstone in my sobriety now...Tonight I m so proud to be part of a family that doesn t drink. There are kids laughter delicious food cakes soft drinks coffee noise *lots* of noise but *no drama*. No tears. No hard words. No regrets...Generations of people who don t drink - and then there s me. I don t drink either...**OH WAIT!! FIVE families - you my dear SD brother and sister you re my family too. Love you all &lt;3**

This is so beautiful. Thanks and congrats! IWNDWYT 
Love this post. Than you for sharing SaintHomer! I think u/everydayanewday was right. What we're doing is hard. And that's ok. I'm proud of you too! And of me and of all of us. Cheers with a Passionfruit La Croix my friend! &lt;3 
Sounds like you have a good support structure bud. No temptation plenty of  normality' to learn from and lean on. Good luck. IWNDWYT.
There are so many incredible people here. You never know when your comment is the one that really helps someone. Way to go OP keep it rolling !!
For six generations my family on both sides did not drink - thanks to their choice of Church. I've been the black sheep for the post 20 years! I hope they'll be pleased that I'm "coming back to the flock"..
What a great comment. Thanks for sharing. Reminds me of Kintsugi the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery to imply that its imperfections give the pottery character and more beauty than a perfect unbroken piece of pottery. Bless you 
What a great post! Enjoy your weekend!
Man those family gatherings sound awesome. A great environment for you. I'd love to have a family like that 
This post is so wholesome. May God bless you! IWNDWYT
What's going on with your apostrophes? Congrats though!
Great post .... thanks 
Thank you for sharing that and making it part of my sobriety now too. 
Good point about the drama and tears. My wife went on a family vacation and the father in law God smashed off whiskey and basically tore the family apart at dinner. Nearly ruined the rest of the trip. He's a fairly calm and gentle guy (and was sober for many years prior) and that never would have happened if alcohol was not a factor. Shit I can't think of any drug that would have caused so much pain. Yet it's synonymous with "good times". 
That is amazing. It goes to show not only the power of words but the solidarity and strength between people. To think that your family has survived so much difficulty and has come through it on the other side without a drop of alcohol is amazing. You are truly blessed to be a part of such a wonderful tribe.    I will not drink with you today

Similar story in my family but they are a mix of moderate or no drinkers. They are my rock along with SD...Thanks for sharing this. It really resonates...IWNDWYT 
Not drinking today!
What a lovely post Saint Homer   ..I love our non- drinking SD family! Sometimes I look back to some of my very early posts and threads when it was all very new ( you were a supportive voice too!)..I will not drink with you today  
I love your posts.  IWNDWYT
Thanks SH! I come from a family w/no drinking history. Son of a Southern Baptist minister. I get the power of newday's statement. It certainly has helped my mindset for today and forwards. SD has been such a positive help for me. Peace
WNDWYT!
Congrats Saint Homer. Sincerely happy for you. I hope to get there one day. It feels like a pipe dream but I'm trying not to give up
Thank you friend. That really means a lot. Esp since I'm feeling pretty low about the whole thing right now
Wow that's so awesome. What a beautiful and supportive comment! Love it :) 
Wow.... Thank you for coming back to share that to post that. That means a lot to me to see how our words here matter. ..Thanks!
