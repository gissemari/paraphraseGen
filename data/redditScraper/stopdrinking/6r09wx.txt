It's been many days since I started lurking with the intention of quitting (my badge def needs a reset) and I've finally come to the realization that I can't half ass it anymore. It's all or none and in my case it has to be none of the drinking anymore. ..All the heartache all the struggle all the shitty feelings 5 rehabs 3 hospitalizations with acute pancreatitis hundreds of different AA meetings and many thousands of dollars in "help" later I ultimately think what I need is just right here and inside of me...Not drinking anymore. One day at a time or whatever but I'm just not today for sure.

Glad you are here.   Half-assing it didn't work for me either - in the end I just started throwing every resource available at it until I was able to stop and stabilize.  
Not drinking with you today either. I just stay here whenever I can. I probably should try other "help" and I will eventually but for mefor now this place is my lifeline.
