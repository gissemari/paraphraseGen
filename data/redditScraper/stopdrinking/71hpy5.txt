I relapsed probably the worst I ever have.  I'm sitting here shaking and going through withdrawals. I can't stop throwing up. I feel so helpless. I just want someone to hold me and tell me it's gonna be okay. Im scared.

Can't tell you how many times I did the same thing. You're not alone and it is going to be OK...First off withdrawals are no joke. Have you considered heading to an urgent care or emergency room? If so I'd highly recommend it...Always always always better to play it safe! Medical professionals deal with alcohol withdrawals all the time and there's no shame in reaching out for help. They can make the whole process much more comfortable and safe.
Cyber hugs for you. It will certainly be ok if you don't pick up another drink. The joys of sobriety far outweigh the tiny glimpses of whatever it is we get from drinking. Wishing you health joy and peace on your journey. I will not drink with you today.
We're here for you...A physician sounds like a good idea!..Let us know how you are!
