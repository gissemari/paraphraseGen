To those who are having a hard time in their early days of sobriety I want to share a moment of unexpected contentment. I have suffered depression anxiety and abuse for a good portion of my young life so far. I've been suicidal and homicidal with one hospitalization. I don't necessarily believe in fate but I always believed from the moment I was born I was destined to be a piece of shit worthless fuck up. Well the other night my dad picked me up from my AA meeting and as I got out of the car I said "I'm looking forward to tomorrow." When I heard what I had said I broke down in tears. Happy tears. I just want to let those who are struggling and asking themselves "What's the point?" know that it does get better. It won't over night (my cravings are still several times a day) but you will begin to notice the little things change.

This gave me goosebumps.  You're on your way /u/WheredTheCheeseGo -- keep not picking up the next drink and who knows what the future holds for you.
These small joys are what I call spiritual experiences. Thanks for sharing.

'I'm looking forward to tomorrow'. Powerful.
These are the best statements.  That there is hope for the hopeless.  God luck with many more days of comfortable sobriety. 
Thank you for that..The concept of 'hope' is still something I'm struggling with.
I'm so happy that you shared this. It is truly touching. I hope you've had a good night. :)
