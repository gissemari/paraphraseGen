I'm beginning to struggle. It will be a miracle if I get through today without drinking.
----------immediate responses--------

It won't be a miracle (external force) it will be a victory (internal force). If day by day is too hard do hour by hour or minute by minute. Sometimes in the early days the primary focus of my day had to be not drinking above all else. Avoid all triggers stay full and eat whatever I want exercise read positive and helpful recovery type material go to a meeting distract with whatever works - whatever it takes to get through the day sober. Once you start falling down that hole you have to do whatever you can to pull yourself out. ..Above all I had to allow myself to be kind to myself and believe that I was worth saving at all costs.
Someone on here made me a spreadsheet that blocked off 3 days into 15 minute time increments. When I was struggling I would print one out and start crossing off each 15 minutes til I worked thru whatever was happening if I could even figure that out. As agreed below distraction is the key for you right now. For me I wanted to be sober more than I wanted any other thing in my life. It has to be that dramatic for me. GOod luck. Read everything.
Hi Neptune. You can do this. Sending you best wishes and not drinking with you today:-)
It's been 5 hours since your post.  I hope you rode the wave.  I like to physically do something.  In no time at all my mind is on to the next.  I wont drink with you today.
I'd go to a meeting and get support!
I feel you me too. Let's just not fucking drink for now fuck!
