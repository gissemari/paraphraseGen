I don't think I have experienced paws until today. I don't even know if this is paws. Started the day with low energy was beat tired all day depressed anxiety  and just negative thoughts. I snapped off really bad on the dude I been partnered up with for the last 6 months at work. That is not me I'm usually really chill. Sitting at home laying around I don't even feel like talking to my wife. I can see how this causes many to relapse. I sure hope I don't feel this tomorrow. I just needed to vent. IWNDWYT

how far along are you into your sobriety?.
Pardon my ignorance but what is paws?
Syndrome not Symptom autocorrect...
I have been feeling so many similar things. My moods are all over the place I'm depressed more often than not and just all around grumpy and because of that I feel guilty that I'm not "myself" lately with the people around me. All we can do is keep walking through this I guess. I certainly don't want anyone to feel this way but it does help to know we're not alone...Thanks for venting; I wish you more joy filled days ahead and I will not drink with you tonight. 
I hear ya I went through that too. Went on way longer than I thought it would too sorry to say several months. I hope yours passes quickly.
