A year ago today I woke up in a hospital and surrendered my will to something larger than myself. There have been many ups and downs but never any regrets. I live every day with a new sense of gratitude. I am so grateful to be alive and I want anyone who is suffering with the same struggle to know- there is a better way to live. Today I am truly alive!

So awesome. These posts really help to keep me motivated! Thank you! 
Right behind you! Congrats! Ending up in the hospital is a huge wake up call
Congrats on 872 days.  Thanks for sharing.  For me sobriety has definitely brought a better attitude.  I too am trying to be grateful and have gratitude.  In hindsight I see alcohol sometimes turned me into a Debbie Downer. More than that alcohol was an escape from facing moments that required stretching out of my skin into an uncomfortable zone.  Clearly avoidance causes life issues.  I am struggling now to make some difficult calls (work related because I somewhat dropped the ball servicing some accounts.)  Any suggestions?  I won't drink with you today.
