I am convinced this attempt at sobriety is going to stick even though it's taken a few attempts over the past few months.  The biggest conundrum for me has been my sleep.  ..When drinking daily it was easy to pass out but then of course waking up in the middle of the night sweating nauseated and with a racing heart often made it impossible to get back to sleep...With each attempt at stopping drinking I was pretty much sleepless for several nights and I felt like a zombie during the daytime.  After 5 days or so I slept like a rock for several days from pure exhaustion. But this sleep pattern didn't last...I know it's early on but I seem to have developed a consistent sleep pattern of waking every 2.5 hours.  I am able to doze back off without a problem but I have been obsessively worried about the fact that I'm not sleeping for a straight 7 or 8 hours - thinking I've ruined my brain or something from so much drinking and too many relapses...Then I found this article.  Apparently waking several times a night is normal for adults.  Just knowing this is very comforting to me.  The author is an expert so I trust his opinion...I just wanted to share this because I'm sure a lot of people here are experiencing changes in their sleep patterns...Have a good week everybody and IWNDWYT...[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-cunnington/is-it-normal-to-wake-up-at-night\_b\_8756724.html](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-cunnington/is-it-normal-to-wake-up-at-night_b_8756724.html)..&amp;#x200B;

I got a Fitbit and became obsessed with my sleep patterns and waking multiple time (not aware of these periods) Obviously that obsession made me wake more often. I now don't sleep with it on anymore and sleep has improved. 
It helps me to listen to sleep meditation or relaxing music (free apps on phone or you tube) just stops my mind from racing around
