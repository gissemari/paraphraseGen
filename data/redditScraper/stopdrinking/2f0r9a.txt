Well not entirely true. My SO bought a new rum and asked me to taste his rum and coke. I took a tiny sip savoured the flavour and woke up fresh as a daisy this morning...Tonight is going to be a struggle because I have to go to a bar for a party. Tips and tricks are welcome and appreciated. So far I plan to stick to drinking something fizzy (and obviously nonalcoholic) and ALWAYS having a drink in my hand. ...How's your Labour Day weekend going?..UPDATE: I have offered to drive tonight to be SURE that I won't be tempted and will have a damn good excuse not to drink. .Thanks to all for your advice stories and warnings about how slippery the slope can be. I am not going to drink today.

So is your SO going to be asking you to try his drinks frequently? That seems like trouble... But good luck tonight!!
Savored eh? .
I make a decision not to drink TODAY and that means alcohol is out of my movie all day no matter what.  No sips no savor nothing nada.
