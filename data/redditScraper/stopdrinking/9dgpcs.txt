more accommodation drama to deal with thankfully it turned out the leak going into the apartment below isn't from my old place after all so isn't my responsibility. my first instinct was to drink but thankfully it passed without much fanfare...landlord emailed me about this at 9:30 last night - usually my response would have been to lie awake all night anxiously fretting about it (or drink myself to sleep) but last night I just went to bed. I'm not necessarily sleeping longer - it still takes me a good while to actually drift off - but I'm definitely sleeping harder/deeper. ..does anyone else find they get/got super tired in the early days of quitting? I feel like I'm constantly ready to close my eyes and drift off in spite of my caffeine intake. luckily I'm in a personal office so can occasionally put my head down and take a breather for five minutes but the tiredness is a real struggle. ..despite that: feeling positive feeling great and I won't be drinking with you today.

Yes I was exhausted for a few weeks. I think it's completely normal.
I am 34 days sober and still exhausted.
