I've been really struggling with sobriety lately. I had to reset my badge after 118 days which sucked big-time. The first couple months were a cakewalk compared to how I've felt lately. I didn't think I'd ever have cravings or would even consider breaking my sobriety. Now it's all I think about. ..What's really bugging me is the FOMO -- fear of missing out on all the fun other people are having while they're drinking. I was able to convince myself for a while that being sober at parties and gatherings was cool and gave me a new clarity on things. Now it just feels lame. I miss it I do. It feels unfair. And shitty. I feel like a spoiled kid who just wants to kick her legs and scream 'It's not faaaaaaiiiiiiiirrrr'. More than anything I feel like my sobriety is really in jeopardy these days. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

I don't know if what I have to say will be helpful but the fear of missing out on things sounds like the alcoholism in our brains talking. I missed out on so many things because I drank. The situations I romanticized simply didn't happen or if they did it was decades ago. I have found new things to do other than go to bars. I play board games with friends I go to the dog park and talk about dogs with other people and I find other sober situations to have fun in. To me I make a choice about whether I'm going to have fun or feel like I'm missing out. That works about 90% of the time. The other 10% of the time I wallow in a pity party which doesn't help but it's what I do. I get out of the pity party when I choose to. Usually a nap or eating something healthy helps.
I had the FOMO pretty bad early on. I discovered that I needed to shift my thinking to align with what was objectively most important. I absolutely cannot go back to drinking. I'll die hated by everyone I know if I do. Either that or break their hearts. Now there's something I can miss out on. Feel like a little tantrum time? No problem. I say do it. Whatever keeps you sober. I just need to work on accepting the reality that life is different now and it'll take some time to get used to it. Good luck.
Every few days I have a tantrum of sorts. The it's not fair I want to drink and have fun too tantrum. Mine isn't so much because I'm a huge social butterfly but that I want to drink to make my evening more fun. I have the tantrum feel the bitchy feelings and usually about a half hour later I'm wondering what the hell was I so upset about?! It's like having an internal crabby wine-pushing toddler take over once in awhile. Lol
From the perspective of a few years sober now looking back the only thing I missed out on were handcuffs legal consequences poverty homelessness health relationship disasters and death--I say that because my friends who drank like I did did many of these things while my life got better.
You can use that FOMO to your advantage to stay sober. It's all about perspective. I heard someone say recently that addicts can have their drugs *or they can have literally anything else in the world*. Personally the latter seems much more appealing! That really opened my eyes and helped me realize how much drinking was holding me back from having fun.
&gt; What's really bugging me is the FOMO -- fear of missing out on all the fun other people are having **while** they're drinking...Please excuse the armchair psychology but I think you subconsciously provided an answer to your own problem here. Many people drink **while** they are having fun. ..They are having fun and they are drinking != They are having fun because they are drinking...I'm not that naive I will admit that for some people drinking in moderation enhances their enjoyment of a certain situation. Usually though it's already an enjoyable situation. If it's not and you genuinely don't have any fun unless you're drunk...then it's a shitty party. 
Hate that feeling - it's no fun but you know what else isn't fun? Being broke hungover and living in self pity. That's what I was doing always feeling bad for myself. I see a lot of people i used to drink with out and about and they are constantly saying things like "wow i wish i could give up drinking...NOT" to me when in reality i think they wish they could. It may not seem fair at the time but everybody you see "happily" drinking may not be as happy as they put off. Over time i developed new friend groups. All of these groups are centralized around one healthy habit. I found a few things I like such as biking and hiking and started practicing it regularly. Over time made friends that have shared interests with me other than booze. It was awful putting some of my oldest relationships on the back burner but i have found in the long run it is what needed to be done. 
[like this?](http://i.imgur.com/uPzRI4D.jpg)..Yeah I missed out on being invited to shoot grouse in scotland with Prince Harry because I was sipping ginger ale on the terrace and not puking in the toilet next to the prince's - like my friend who got the invite when he came up for air...I also missed getting sent to the same prison as Charlie Manson - what a story I would have with that!   
I can tell you that at +2 years sober I'm not missing out on much. I have the freedom to do what I want while my "friends" from my drinking days are having "fun" paying the consequences of this disease. They continue to watch the people around them end up in jail or overdose and end up 6 feet in the ground. I most definitely do not have FOMO any more. What's so great about going to a dive bar on a week night and making out with the unemployed seasonal Santa imposter? Nothing.  
I have/had this fear a lot. So much that I've pretty much stuck to the suggestion of "sober people sober places." Then that started wearing thin on me. I went to a show where I knew I wouldn't dance but just watch music. I had a plan: take a sober buddy with me I allowed myself cokes made sure the place had a snacks &amp; left right after. When I left around 12:30 am something struck me: I had thought everyone was as drunk as I used to be at that time (which was pretty darn drunk). Instead I saw people who didn't drink the way I did. They were drunk but not the blitzed I got. That's when I realized how abnormally I drank. My FOMO was created by myself every time I went out because I got black out drunk. Even if I had fun I didn't remember. I chased that elusive fun night when in fact I always missed out because I was black out drunk. I have to remember is create my own FOMO otherwise I'll drink. Thanks for helping me remember this. Stay safe out there fellow sobie. .
I get that sometimes - like heading home from the gym and seeing a pack of people my age dressed up nicely heading into a bar. Yeah a night like that would be nice I think. Then I look at the thing that never lies - data. For every night like that I've had two of drinking alone or in some sketchy dive bar (still alone just surrounded by people). And every night like that didn't stop for me - it kept going long till after my friends were gone often turning into one of THOSE mornings. Yeah that part of the night may be nice but am I willing to pay the price? Hell no. Also is it really the alcohol I'm thinking would be nice? These people aren't even drinking when I see them! 
I've heard my friend's daughter use FOMO quite often.  It's usually couched as an argument of sort to go out and have fun.  But all too often our minds only calculate the fun we're missing out on and not the potential negative effects that may occur...A few ?'s:..Do you FOMO a DUI or possibly killing yourself or someone else while driving drunk?..Do you FOMO the hangovers and feeling like shit all the time?..Do you FOMO possible liver failure?..Do you FOMO being so drunk you are a target for sexual assault?..The list can get very long...Then we usually say to ourselves "Never mind that stuff only happens to other people"...What exactly feels unfair your personal choice not to drink?  Or are you being court ordered not to drink and being subject to random testing?  If that's the case hell yeah it feels unfair...I took a look at your post history and one thing that happens with multiple relapses is the possibility of Kindling: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindling_(sedative-hypnotic_withdrawal)..If your are suffering kindling you may find each relapse worse than the previous and there is the possibility of permanent neurological/CNS damage...The fact that you made it to 118 days is outstanding and a sign of strength.  Take the reset and try to learn what drove you to pick up the drink again.  ..Sometimes it just takes us a little time to get off the runway.  But once we do the beauty from up there is amazing...
