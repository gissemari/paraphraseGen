Not for me but my husband. He's been reading the Bible the last week and it's not cutting it for him. He's looking for something but he's not sure what. He is a naturally skeptic person and we aren't a religious family but we want to grow in a spiritual sense. I can tell that he is struggling with this feeling of a void he wants to fill. I suggested this naked mind to him but he doesn't want to read via iPhone. ..I want to head to the library this week and see what I can find. If anyone can recommend any good self help/spiritual books I'd appreciate it. Does not have to be sobriety focused literature...Thanks in advance!

Is he in recovery? 
Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance.
Awakening joy by James Barez.
I am an atheist and absolutely enjoyed Eckhart Tolle's books. 
I highly recommend How Will You Measure Your Life by Clayton Christensen. It starts a little slow in first couple chapters but is amazing after that.
