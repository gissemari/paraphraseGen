The date of my last drink. I was an extreme binge drinker. 6+ tall boys five nights a week. A 5th or a bottle of wine every other weekend. ..I am one week away from six months sober and due to my alcoholism; I pushed away anybody who would have cared. ..So thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you to those in day one to those on day five thousand. Thank you to those still struggling but desire to quit. There is inspiration and strength in all of you. Stay strong...IWNDWYT.
