For this first time in ages(I'll have a year Jan 1st) I have money to buy presents for my son AND other family members and friends. I haven't been able to do this in probably 10 years. What's crazy is that I knew at those times I would blow my money I used to give my Mom(before she passed in 2014) about $50 to hold for my son knowing I may not have it. I would do this months in advance too. And sure as shit I'd always become a mess again. Especiallyat the holidays. Wellno more damnit!..My Mom would be so happy. I know she's looking down and smiling. Life does get better. I love it! ..And those of you who are struggling please hang in there because it absolutely does get better. If I can do it so can you!..Happy Holidays. Love you guys!
