Congratulations! That 6 looks beautiful! So happy to hear that you're off the BP rx and lost weight - very inspirational as I hope to be off of my rx soon too :).
Well done very happy to hear it! Keep going strong :)
I also lost 40 lbs after being sober... but not as a perk I had to work for it...I'm always happy to see other member of this community losing weight. For me the two are linked together. I couldn't lose weight without being sober. Sobriety made me take a hard look at myself and see a fat fuck...I truly believe that the fat fuck I saw was not the real person I was and it turned out that I was right!
Yay congrats!.
30 Lbs! I second that! Will not drink with you today too! (-:
30 lb???? Awesome
6 months sober no BP meds and 30lbs gone. Congrats and thanks for the inspiration. I hope to report the same soon.
