I used to binge drink heavily from when I was about 15 to 26. I tried to stop many times but kept relapsing. This time it seems to stick. I hope I'll never go back to drinking. I don't want to. I still take it one day at a time. But most days I don't even think about it anymore...I just want to share this to give hope to you guys at 1 or 0 days. It is possible to stop drinking you have the power within you to do it.
