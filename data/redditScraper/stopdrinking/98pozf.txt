I was fine for two months. I didn't drink. If I did it was only a beer. My alcoholic family came up (My mom and dad) and I binged with them. I fucked everything up. Now I'm going through withdrawal and I don't know what to do. I can deal with everything that comes with it besides the anxiety and panic attacks. I have a panic attack every second and I drink to keep the anxiety at bay. It's currently 11pm and I don't know if i will survive the night. My heart is racing and I feel like I'm going to die. Please no one here relapse. I wish I didn't even touch the toxic shit. I don't feel like myself and I'm just looking to keep the panic at bay. The doctors where I live are so understaffed that they closed early and the only choice i have is to either suffer or wait 8 hours at the ER. What should I do? Suffer the panic attacks? Or go and shake like a leaf at the er... I'm so sorry I fucked up. I'm crying as I'm writing this. I wish I was stronger

Glad you're here...Seeing a physician was the best first step for me...Please let us know how you're doing!
If you're shaking bad then I'd definitely go to the hospital if I were you man that can potentially be deadly

The only thing that any one of us can do is to tell you to see a doctor. The internet is not a good source of medical information and withdrawal can be dangerous even deadly. We have removed your post and hope you'll seek medical support.
