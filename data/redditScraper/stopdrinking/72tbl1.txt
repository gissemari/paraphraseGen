Hi everybody! I've been struggling with drinking for years now and have been dodging every excuse to just cut the crap and quit. I'm not one of those people who can "just have one or two" and it's time I own up to it. I've been lurking the sub for weeks now and have finally decided to put myself out there. I'm hoping that putting a commitment to text will help me strive forward towards a sober and happy life. Today's challenge? Heading to the last home game of my favorite baseball team for an afternoon at the park. Wish me luck and thank you for being here!

Welcom. Glad to have you here! I will not drink with you today.
Congrats on your first post!  I recently decided to come out of the shadows and make a commitment as well.  And I also have a challenging scenario coming up today so I'll stay strong and not drink with you- we can do it!
Welcome. I won't drink with you today   enjoy the game ! 
You won't be dissapointed! Improvements come so fast if you are looking for them. Maybe take a brisk walk around after the game so you are extra tired before bed :) Not drinking with you today!
I wont drink with you today
Good for you...I will not have a beer at the ballpark with you. Ballgames are hard for me to not drink at. I wish you strength today.
