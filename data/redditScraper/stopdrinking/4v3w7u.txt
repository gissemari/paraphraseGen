Excuse my writing. My thoughts are still all over the place. I am a ball of nerves and I feel like my brain is swimming. But I have made it through the day. The anxiety and physical pain of withdraw made it really hard still is. However through you all here at SD my SO my sister and a dear friend who I let down and yet still had so much grace and kindness in her to talk me off the metaphorical ledge. Instead of letting me wallow in my shame and self pity. She asked that I be kind to myself and allow myself time for my body to heal from this bender and to not make this whole event drawn out. Let it go and do what you need to do to make sure you don't have to go through this again. She took away a small portion of the guilt I am feeling for barely being able to mom today. I am so grateful to her. I feel like a fraud with my parents though. I am being a terrible daughter and lying about my drinking trying to make them think that everything is alright when it is not at all. I just can't bring myself to tell them (for the billionth time) that I am struggling with my alcoholism. I know they'd be supportive too but how many times can you break a parents heart and trust? I want to get myself healthy before I address my relapse with them. Get a little sobriety time and start doing the things to make me better although knowing them like I do they probably already know. I am 31 and still acting like a selfish slobbish irresponsible child. I have my own child I do so well for a while. Home cooked meals fun outtings crafts. I actually am great and fun and then BAM! I pick up that first drink on Friday and its off and running all weekend. Followed by a hellish Monday where the guilt and shame of another wasted weekend is crippling until Thursday when I pull it together only to have Friday arrive again. Sigh....ugh I'm rambling and having a pity party again. I am making an easy hamburger helper taking an epsom bath and melatonin. Then reading my boy a story and going to bed. Tomorrow morning I will put yoga mat outside and try meditating. I'll probably just have a good cry. either way. Out with the bad. deep cleansing breaths. Everyday is a new opportunity to live better right?

I'll stay sober with you today! I'm hoping that since you've made it through day 1 you'll rest well and start a new day with a fresh view. I'm working on being kind to myself and it's a lot easier with each day. Hang in there!
Your friend sounds extremely compassionate. .Sorry you're going through this and congrats on day one.
