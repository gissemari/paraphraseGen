The earlier question about what everyone does with old chips kind of prompted this. I've previously received a 1 month chip but have since relapsed. My question is: what is the general consensus (if there is one) or even your personal thoughts on receiving the same chip twice? I would like to get a chip when I reach that milestone again but I worry that it might come off as tacky or rude or something to ask for the same chip multiple times. It's been almost six months since I got that chip. I also don't get to make it to many meetings anymore. There are two or three a week in my town that don't coincide with my work hours so I've kinda fallen out of the community here...Also how common is it for someone to pass a chip on to a newbie? I've heard about it quite a bit but I only know of one person for sure irl who received a chip for a time he hadn't yet completed. ...sigh I just wish I could get back and start being a contributing member of my group. And also get that chip again and many more!

Don't let it bother you go get your milestone chip with the full intention of making your successive chip the 2-month chip.  AA meetings love and are thrilled to mark milestones--and I've often been in charge of AA meetings that hand out chips I've purchased the chips and I've awarded the chips.  Not once did it ever occur to me that someone shouldn't get a chip--it's the days sober that we want to honor and illustrate for others.
Some people have a collection of chips having relapsed and started over many times.  Do it!
