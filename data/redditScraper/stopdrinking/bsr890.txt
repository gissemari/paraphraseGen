Lots of background... won't bother you all with the details . But I'm a Pearson who I know struggles with drinking ... my SO and I got into an argument. I honestly feel like it blew up only because I stood my ground  finally . I spent way too much money on this 3 day weekend for a hotel in my area just to get away . I have been drinking and I know that will make my situation question my choice although I know it was right and just . Help me not feel complete regret when I wake . 3 am anxiety. I dread it . Or maybe I just deserve it . I hate this jail I'm in I hate this life .

Maybe sobriety is the strength you need to get out of this relationship?
I am sorry that you are in a bad space in your life.  As so often happens in life there  are are a number of issues going on. I can only relay my own experience which is that drinking compounded problems. Giving up was difficult but it did separate out cause and effect on other matters.  Alcohol has a surprising number of side effects including increasing anxiety and impairing decision making processes (even when you have sobered up).  Two books have helped me This Naked Mind by Annie Grace and Alcohol Explained by William Porter.  We are here to listen and to support you come here often.
I did the EXACT same thing. I've been blowingb through money in a hotel room because I had to leave my SO. But then I went on bender for all the wrong reasons. I needed to leave. The drinking just made my decisions look irrational. You're ok. Sober up. Relax. Irrational drunk thoughts got us here.
As outlined in the community guidelines we ask that you only post when you have not been drinking. For this reason we had to remove your post. But we'll be here tomorrow if you want to come back then.
