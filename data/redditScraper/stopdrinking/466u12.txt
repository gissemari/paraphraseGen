Shortly after I stopped drinking a crusty old timer told me "Go to funerals of people in the program." He went on to say it didn't matter if I knew them well I wasn't going for them. ..I expected I was going for other people and it turned out I was. But also it helped me. I saw people I had known for years struggling only to relapse and overdose and die. It was a reminder of why I still day-to-day decide to /r/stopdrinking. ..Then today there was John. John had cancer a couple of years ago but beat it. It came back and he found it a few weeks ago. A week ago he learned it had spread through his entire body and was on hospice days after...Many from my 12-step home group visited John. He died this morning. ..My home group was tonight. It was a very somber meeting but there was some good inappropriate comments followed by laughter. It's a good home group. We're there for each other and we were there for him in the end. ..Nobody drank today. Not even John.

I'm sorry for your loss.  Thank goodness for the support of your group grieving with others is better than grieving alone.
Rest in peace John.
