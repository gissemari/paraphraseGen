Hi guys Happy Wednesday! WuW is where we calibrate our week check in and see how our SD buds are doing and support each other in our sobriety.  Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type with us!..**Triumph:**  I'm in the middle of a few days off of work.  The last few days were pretty stressful and were spent taking care of a lot of problems that had perhaps been put off too long.  I'm going to seriously relax tomorrow and the next day.  I'm not going to feel guilty about doing nothing and enjoying it.   ..**Struggle:**  I'm posting this later than I usually do.  I was high last night. Really high. I include using weed in my definition of sobriety when posting.  I go back and forth on whether I want to stop using weed or not.  I see the patterns with my substance use.  I know I use it because I am bored.  I know if I don't get high I will want to do something else.  I have used other substances this week other than weed.  I haven't drank in eight months but I debate with myself whether I've really been working to be  sober  that whole time.  ..**General Chat:** What do you want for Christmas?  I want more self discipline. I need to work on cultivating that.  There's some dog herding and agility classes are here I saw a week or two ago.  I want the self discipline to follow through in looking into that and maybe taking the dog to some classes.

Triumph: I just finished my national service. I almost ruined it because I drank so much but sober periods saved my ass. Also I haven't had a drink in 5 days...Struggle: I want to drink so bad right now. I'm spending the holidays at my parent's house. They are getting a divorce because my father is an active alcoholic with no intentions of quitting or getting help. I have no real relationship with him because he is but a shadow of a man he once was. I'm having a hard time enjoying my time here because I'm seeing my old man every day which makes me want to drink and forget our fucked up relationship...General chat: I want to feel good in my own skin. I want to spend my days doing something else than obsessing about whether I'm going to drink today or not. ..Have a nice rest of the year everyone! :)
Been a pretty good week...**Triumph:** Went to my first meeting last Saturday which was good and I can't wait for my next meeting. I've been getting stronger as an emotional person through the struggles I've been putting myself through lately so I can feel those growing pains but I'm not even entertaining the idea of giving in. ..**Struggle:** I'm leaving the band I've been in for 11 years and it is incredibly sad but I'm doing it to protect my sobriety and also for my own professional growth in the music business. It has been the hardest struggle with urges since I quit drinking. For a couple of days I fell back into the routine of eating garbage and sleeping in and the very fucking second my guard gets weak the addiction sneaks into my head and talks to me in my own voice. I didn't let the scum bag get the best of me but it was the first real struggle I've had as far as urges go. I'm stronger than the addiction. Onward and upward!.**GC:** I'd like to finally get my license back after all of the hard work I've put into jumping through hoops. Also some musical equipment or a pony. 
Triumph: One month of no booze. I think my SSRIs are kicking in and I'm getting off the Ambien in favor or an herbal supplement (mostly melatonin). I've been sleeping much better in the past few days after only getting 2 hours on Friday. I feel like a dark cloud has been following me for months and it finally feels like sunny skies...Struggle: I'm too comfortable not drinking. I need to constantly remind myself that it is not okay for me to drink. The mind has a funny was of quickly forgetting the bad and remembering the good...General chat: I've got 5 days off work after tomorrow. I'll be hanging out with friends watching my daughter (day care is closed) and headed in a 5 hour trip to see family. It's going to be a crazy couple of days but I'm actually looking forward to it.
Triumph: 13 days till 365!..Got a dog on Sunday (12/20)!..German shepherd/rotti mix. I have wanted a dog like him for years. .I posted a while back about my GF getting a nice promotion at work that allowed us to move into a house in order to get a pup..Struggle: I'm so fucking angry right now. My mother called me yesterday in tears saying the dog is going to rip the family apart and we'll never see them because we'll have to take care of him. She said "I wish you just would have waited another week to get a dog" which struck something to my core. I've wanted a dog like him for years! My GF and I had looked at 2 dogs we wanted (dogs that had been there for ~7 months) online from this shelter and the day before we were going to go actually meet them they were pending adoption. We had 2 other dogs we wanted to look at as well they went pending for adoption ON THE WAY TO THE SHELTER. ..And she has the audacity to tell me I should have postponed MY happiness and risk losing this pup that my GF and I absolutely fell in love with from the first time we met him...I get it it's the holidays. She wants us all to be together. My oldest brother got selected for promotion (USMC) and might get orders to Germany or somewhere else and holidays will be harder then. My second oldest brother got married not too long ago and they will probably start popping out babies soon making holidays even harder...It also seems like we go through this same song and dance almost every major holiday (thanksgiving xmas the big ones). My GF and I have been together 7 years. That's been 7 years of splitting holidays. WHY IS IT ALWAYS A GIANT SHOCK THAT WE WILL BE SPLITTING THESE HOLIDAYS!? We were thinking about all this last night and we're almost 100% positive we've spent much more time the last 5 xmas's at MY parent's place. I just don't get it.....GF's uncle (whom she and everyone in her family was extremely close with) passed away earlier this year due to cancer and we want to spend more time with her family this year since it will be tough for everyone involved...I read a post here not too long ago about being angry and how our brains are wired to want immediate good results when working on things and when things don't work it makes us angry. (obviously not everyone but I really connected with the post as it's how I've been feeling for a few months now)..I'm trying to work on it. I know being angry doesn't help any situation. but just.......WTF.........General Chat: Enjoy your time off! sounds well deserved! .I also read a post about MJ use here the other day and some wise user said something along the lines of "it's your sobriety you define it how you want. but a good way to look at it is to evaluate your current life satisfaction/health benchmark" (don't remember this exact line)..For xmas I wanted this dog and I got him and we're going to be shelling out for expensive training so this is my gift to my GF and her gift to me. Couldn't be happier with him....but effin A people.... ..Edit: I want so badly to tell them to fuck off this xmas and just not go spend all of xmas at the GF's family's place..But I've watched my dad's side of the family pull stupid shit like that my whole life. The majority of them barely speak anymore due to it. I don't want that to happen to my family as we're all extremely close from moving constantly (dad was USMC) and only having each other every time. But I feel like I won't be able to come down from this in 2 days...and I don't want to get there and say or do something so out of character for me just because I'm so angry...Edit 2: As per /u/the_pissed_off_goose 's request pictures to follow up on later..Edit 3: Fuck me. Today just took a nose dive. we met with a behavioral specialist for the dog today. she recommended we take him back to the shelter we got him from. And that he doesn't really belong in any household..I'm typing this through tears. Only had him 3 days but I feel like this is ripping my heart out..I hope you all will excuse me for not posting pictures..I still won't drink tonight. my promise.
**Triumph:** Sober! Christmas shopping for myself which includes notebooks and fabric. ..**Struggle:** I need to take a shower - it's been five days but I lack motivation. All I want to do is read comic books and drink LaCroix...**General Chat:** I would like to be spending time with my self-picked family rather than my current. Even though it's good to see them it's a lot of stress. 
Triumph: I've been spinning my wheels since my marriage ended five years ago looking for long in all the wrong places. But this year in July I met the most amazing man. We're about to spend our first Christmas together. I love the holidays and so does he. Until he came along though I was surrounded by Scrooge McDucks and he hasn't celebrated Christmas since his mom died years ago. I'm so excited to create new holiday traditions with him! We're making popcorn and cranberry garland for the tree and going to midnight mass tomorrow night...Struggle: Like OP I struggle mentally with my use of cannabis. It's time to put the zigzags down I think. I'm ready...General chat: it's really quiet at work this week and I'm losing my MIND with boredom. I even cross stitched a Chewbacca yesterday from a pattern I designed myself!
Triumph: Jumping the gun a little on this one but I'll have 200 days on Christmas. Best gift I could get/give myself. Longest I've been sober since I fell off the wagon the first time a couple years ago...Struggle: Not going home for Christmas this year. First time I think ever I won't be there for at least a little bit around this time of year. Just couldn't do it with the move and the cost of plane tickets from CA to NY...General Chat: I think I have all I want for Christmas. Although since I started my new job and it's a business casual dress code I've become a bit obsessed with buying shirts. So many colors! So many options! Hehe.
**Triumph**: Overcame a very difficult Friday. 3 Holiday parties Alcohol everywhere and I did not drink. I couldn't believe it. Gained a lot of confidence and knowledge after that one. Had no idea I was that strong...**Struggle**: I MISS BEER. UGH. I used to love a good beer during a meal. Not the drunk but the taste. I've been getting cravings and thoughts in my head come up like "hey just one. that's fine." but it's NOT 1 will turn to 3 and then I'll think I can moderate with liquor and that will tun to 5 and then DISASTER. NO. I WILL NOT DRINK TODAY..**General Chat**: 12 day Holiday vacation starts today and I cannot waitttt to take some time to do things I love. Happy Holidays yall.
**Triumph:** Got stuck in my head yesterday mid-day pretty bad. Rather than walking down to the bar and take what would turn out to be the day off I ran to the store and got a couple Christmas gifts taken care of and came back to work :)..**Struggle:** Irritability is definitely an issue right now and I'm finding myself being grumpy with the wife and kids for seemingly no reason. Need to check myself throughout the day take stock of the blessings I enjoy and stop getting pissed at the world that I can't drink...**General Chat:** I want new hockey skates for Christmas and I know my wife already got them for me. The new ice rink opens up next week and I'll have good exercise again that I actually enjoy.
Triumph: Avoided the last three days of office drinking. That includes lunch pints and when the managers leave for the evening. I just went home. Feeling good about that...Struggle: The questions I am going to get about not boozing are gonna start tonight. They'll be shocked when I tell them I wont be  drinking this year for Christmas. I'm still feeling a bit shit about the horrible stuff I got up to at the weekend and just want to distance myself from that bad decision...General chat: Generally I'm OK. Just getting on with it. Looking forward to getting more days under my belt. Happy to be back here among all you folks.
**Triumph:**  90 days of sobriety on Saturday!  It feels kind of unreal to be honest.  I got lots of hugs for it at an AA meeting on Monday and that felt really good...**Struggle:**  Holy crap booze everywhere.  I don't think I realized how much people talk about it around the holidays.  I got tagged on an Xmas whisky video earlier this week from someone I haven't talked to in ages and then another friend who doesn't know yet that I'm sober posted a joke about how she was going to turn all her friends into alcoholics over the holidays.  Complete with a comment from someone else joking that they weren't an alcoholic because they don't go to meetings.  Oh my precious precious ego.  I thought maybe I was in danger of forgetting how far I've come but that sure brought it all back real quick.  I'm logged out of facebook until the holidays are over...**General Chat:**  #1 I want to stay sober.  I can't go back.
Triumph: After a failed suicide attempt and being sectioned for a week and a bit I'm finally discharged and during the time asked to help others become sober. :D ..Struggle: Adjusting to life again outside of being locked away. It's weird plus more and more people mentioning "life without alcohol isn't fun" and I can't help but wonder at some points. ..General Chat: A new job :D 
**Triumph:** The supplement I'm taking has helped balance my mood better. I still get agitated but not to the same extreme. It's been a few days since my bf and I have had a big fight. I'm starting to feel like a drink or two would ruin this progress...**Struggle:** I'm still fighting a lack of energy and an underlying funk from my situation. Getting going each day is a chore...**General:** I'm toying around with the idea of a blog where I can write about my struggles and finding relief a natural way. I'm hoping it is therapeutic for myself but also could potentially help someone else. 
**Triumph**: I weighed myself and I've lost about 5 pounds...**Struggle**: Already got in one argument about the holidays with my SO. I really wanted a drink then but I avoided that and went to sleep early instead.
Triumph: I didn't drink today!..Struggle: My emotions have been absolutely haywire the past 9 days and the heartbreak I experienced 5 months ago is feeling fresh. I haven't talked to her in 3 months and probably never will again (she completely pushed me out of her life) and it hurts. It hurts so fucking much. I miss her so badly. I was basically completely numb until I got sober and it's really just been hitting me hard. Just about hanging in there. I'm pretty young and haven't had any similar experiences it just feels real shitty and I want it to go away WITHOUT the use of alcohol...General: Christmas music is the devil am I alone in this?
Triumph: Well for starters I didn't drink today! I also got some laundry and cleaning done and wrapped a few gifts...Struggle: Anxious about not drinking the next few days. My family knows I have a drinking problem but I haven't told them that I'm sober (and don't really plan to my extended family that is) and I feel that everyone will notice that I'm NOT drinking and realize that I really do have a problem and that I finally accepted it... then talk about it amongst themselves afterward like "wow galaxyhigh didn't drink she's so much better as a sober person!" I know this sounds soo ridiculous because it's obviously all positive but I'm stubborn and I have a low self-esteem and would rather just pretend nothing in the past happened and that this is how I've always been. I hope no one brings up alcohol to me at all. I don't want to talk about it with any of them. ..General chat: For Christmas I want to become engaged to my boyfriend but that's not going to happen quite yet (he's given me a two year dating minimum we've been together for 9 months but it feels like an eternity because we've been friends for so long). It's amazing realizing you've found your person. He's been so supportive and has gone full sober with me because he loves me so much. Having a sober buddy with me all the time has made this a lot easier for me and I am deeply touched by his gift of not drinking. ..After typing this I realize that I am very grateful for my life. It makes me sad that just a week ago I was getting piss drunk and saying awful things to the people I love. I'm excited for my new life.
