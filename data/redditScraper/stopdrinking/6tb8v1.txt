it feels like i've been sober a lot longer than this my life has taken a complete transformation that feels so natural to me now. not drinking makes so much sense it's hard to believe that it was such a struggle for me socially to stop. i supposed just going thru the motions in order to stop made me realize how simple it is and how over complicated i made it out to be in my head before i stopped drinking. i love my new life and i'm so grateful. i had tried AA in the past and it scared the shit out of me the people were abrasive and creepy (maybe i'm just part of this distance internet addicted young generation) but stopdrinking has changed my life. also i had a ton of skin problems (i was only drinking once or twice a week heavily) so i didn't think it was the alcohol causing it but my skin is completely clear now. i think i may actually be allergic to alcohol and not have realized it and it could have been affecting me really hard mentally and physically because of that too.

Hey that's great! I won't drink with you tonight!
Right there with you.  I'm only my first month in (first straight month I've been sober in about four years) but I feel like I've already changed my entire life...I just imagine what three six or twelve months is going to feel like and it keeps me going!..Glad you're doing well OP!  I won't drink with you today.
