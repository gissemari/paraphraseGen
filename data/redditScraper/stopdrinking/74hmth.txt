strong thoughts surrounding drinking have been coming up a lot for me recently so i'm sharing them with you now. this is all hard-won knowledge that's come to me since trump's inauguration when i decided to either numb myself into oblivion or try to awaken to quit drinking. perhaps something in these words will resonate. all this is said with humility...i'm always somewhat taken aback when people who seem perfectly confident in their alcohol consumption hear i'm not drinking. way more often than not they'll immediately reach out and tell me they sincerely wish they could cut back or quit but that it's just not in the cards considering the various challenges in their lives. it's interesting because so much of "casual" social drinking masquerades as just that: casual relaxing... the good life. but so often i hear this sort of regret and resignation...i first tried to stop drinking back in 2012. i had stopped for about a month when i started dating my then-girlfriend. the way she talked about alcohol was intriguing to me - she took the word "spirit" literally and would talk about how -used correctly- fine alcohols like mezcal were tools for self-knowledge and spiritual growth. sure maybe in some cultures and in some contexts but i call bullshit on this half-baked new age approach. it's like - everything can be used as a medicine in the right ceremonial context (tobacco included) but let's not delude ourselves into thinking western culture hasn't completely perverted and capitalized on these substances and led us into a babylon-like state of profane excess...i wasn't secure in my stance on the booze at the time so we would drink together and often. somehow if we were drinking "nice" alcohol (funky wines local IPA small batch mezcal) we were somehow excused from the fact that it's still poison. we were ultimately not compatible regardless but i know for certain that alcohol exacerbated every argument and conflict tenfold. i will push back on Naked Mind on one aspect - she firmly argues that these alcohols don't actually taste good. i do sometimes miss the taste...I want to mention Spirit in the context I've experienced God (or whatever you call Him/Her). Spirit doesn't usually speak to me in hollywood-style epiphanies. Spirit speaks to me in small and subtle moments tender whispers silent beatitude none of which can be perceived when inebriated or hungover. i've had some epic moments connections and realizations while drunk but they pros simply not outweigh the cons...as biological organisms beholden to entropy shouldn't we simplify and judge what we put in our body in terms of how toxic or not it is for us? so if alcohol is proven to be toxic and lethal why do we we delude ourselves into thinking it's helping us or somehow romantic? is it thanatos the death drive that we all have inside of us? as alluring as the death drive is aren't health and radiance sexier? and isn't it interesting how when looking at "drugs" that the substances that obliterate our egos (LSD ayahuasca and other entheogens) carry virtually no neurotoxicity whereas the ones that bolster our sense of ego and self-aggrandizement (alcohol cocaine) are sure to kill used for long enough?..The slipperiest part of the drinking slope is that there is always a million reasons to do it always plenty of tiny mini celebrations and reunions every day of the week and likewise just as many heartaches disappointments and stressers. so alcohol becomes a catch-all around every turn. I find that I struggle in unexpected places and moments. but that's the thing the craving is always just a moment a passing impulse. usually i just need to get hydrated or eat something...I've just had to learn to deal with micro-moments like these make peace with being bored frustrated sad whatever. It can definitely be a struggle to abstain. but I've started to seriously ask myself. so what if it's a struggle?! Why can't we handle struggles if it leads us closer to enlightenment and a higher power? If we've really identified a vicious cycle with drinking and found tools to pursue another way of living then why wouldn't we do everything in our power to live our best lives? the lessons I've learned while sober this year as well as my deepening self love have made it easier and easier to realize the challenge is worth it...None of this really stops me from going to bars or connecting with people. I mean I look at my connection with my new girlfriend. It's true and profound and passionate. and alcohol has nothing to do with it. sure I prolly leave bars earlier than I used to but it's probably best I didn't have that 3rd or 4th or 5th drink anyway right?..thanks for reading. this sub has been immensely helpful for me..

&gt;aren't health and radiance sexier? and isn't it interesting how when looking at "drugs" that the substances that obliterate our egos (LSD ayahuasca and other entheogens) carry virtually no neurotoxicity whereas the ones that bolster our sense of ego and self-aggrandizement (alcohol cocaine) are sure to kill used for long enough?..i've never noticed this before.  thank you!
