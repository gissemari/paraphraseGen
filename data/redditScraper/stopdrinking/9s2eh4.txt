I was sober for almost 30 days and yesterday I relapsed. I bought a lot of beer and snacks and drink whole day long...Now I sitting surrounded of a lot of empty bottles with headache and all other symptoms of hangover...But it not the end of the world. In my previous relapse I drink almost one week and after it I had crazy bad hangover I felt like dying. And now I will not repeat my previous mistake and I quit drinking right now! ..Hope this period of sobriety will last at least one year.

Don't hope. MAKE it last a year. Hope insinuates powerlessness and being powerless is weakness of the mind in my humble opinion. Sure you got caught in a moment of weakness but a moment of weakness is much better than living a life of weakness...I know in the beginning it can be tough and feel hopeless trust me I was there but just like going to the gym if you keep exercising that brain it's going to get stronger and eventually you really won't give a shit about drinking. You just have to make sure you build that muscle and maintain it...This place is a great place to see all the different methods people use to exercise that mind muscle whether it be AA SMART simply reading books or joining sports. Find what works for you and crush it. 
You were roughly 96% successful. Be proud of that learn from your mistake and sober on. Name one other area where 96% is anything less than excellent
