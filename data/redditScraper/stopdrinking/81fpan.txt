I got through the weekend with my friends on the trip and had a wonderful time.  Unfortunately drinking. :(  Told myself I was going to quit after the weekend and going on 6 days sober now.  Day 5 wasn't a relapse of drinking it was a relapse of all the emotions I had been hiding buried by alcohol.  On day 5 I start consoling and seeing how much hurt and anger was in my life.  Came home and everything wasn't the same I was seeing my life and through different eyes.  I can tell something this time is different.  Every time I had pushed to stop drinking in the past I had responded to myself in anger and frustration.  This time its like a gentle touch a acceptance.  Been keeping myself busy by removing popcorn ceilings and prepping for our next child (20 weeks along).
