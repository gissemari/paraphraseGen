I woke up hungover for hopefully the last time I was scared and excited to begin out patient treatment for my addiction but I knew if I didn't I would eventually lose everything I care about. The last five weeks have been difficult but worth every moment I have had to fight off the urge to shut out the world and pick up a bottle. This community has been a huge help and I can't thank you all enough. From the day 1s to the day 15000 and of course the relapsers who show us that moderation is a myth you are all amazing and we can beat this together...This past Saturday I had my daughter all day while my wife worked and instead of counting down the hours until I could drink we played and had fun. My daughter is a true miracle and after how hard she fought to be here she deserves a sober Daddy. I am looking forward to my holiday break and enjoying my family sober instead of being drunk for two weeks...IWNDWYT!
