As I have not been able to live much outside of my own head (can't sleep can't eat can't think) I have been reminiscing on the spiral and my current consequences thanks to alcohol.  I will be checking into treatment tomorrow and shortly after will lose my license and begin my newly earned legal/financial battle.  I was thinking in my head before I officially committed to treatment  how do I let the judge know that I am a genuinely good person  that I want help  I don't want these negative situations in my life etc?.    I thought telling him/her my intent for rehab would do the trick.  Until I realized I haven't been a good person.  I am currently not a good person.  I would be drinking now to drown the sorrows and get some sleep if I could.  And why would me going to rehab be a get off free card?  If I was the judge and knew my background I would be saying  Bro you should've been in there a couple years ago!   I'm a sick/broken person who is a true danger to society when a single drink hits my lips.   ..I look back (inside my own head still) and realize my drinking has made me a liar cheater lousy friend/bf/son/brother.  I haven't taken the necessary steps to protect myself from myself... as well as protect the rest of the world from myself.  Yeah tons of AA meetings especially after a relapse.  But no sponsor no reaching out over the phone to the AA communities I've been in no real true commitment to stop this spiral as much as my commitment to continue to have alcohol and drugs ruin my life.   ..This thought then turned to fear.  I've lost it all and keep losing it.  Professional athlete with a future fianc  to single but still employed with a great new job(lucky) to being in debt at my parents house with no license(earned).  No time is better than now for me to try rehab.  The next bottom could/will be losing my freedom or killing somebody.  I need to dive into recovery just like I dove into booze partying and drugs at the beginning of my use.  ..Good luck to us all and may we all find that inner peace that so many before us have found.  I will be hard on myself today so that I can continue to learn/grow/heal over this long road of recovery to being my old self a responsible citizen of the world.

The good news is you NEVER have to feel this way again!..Alcohol made me a liar and a thief.  Alcohol made it easy for me to lie to myself misrepresent my impairment to others and "try to keep it secret".  That resulted in guilt and shame.  I stole emotional connection and my presence from my loved ones....I needed support to be successful.  I went to meetings and immediately found people who understood what I was experiencing.  They were warm welcoming and non judgmental...They were sober wanted to stay sober and amazingly wanted to help ME be sober!..Evening meetings were especially helpful!.
