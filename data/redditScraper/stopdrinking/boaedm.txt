I relapsed after seven months sober and then drank for two more every night. Until today. I finally scared myself to consider getting back on the right path after behaving like a reckless jerk Saturday night. I have been riding this sick wave every day knowing that it was about to come crashing down and I could drown at any moment. I don't want to live like that anymore. Last time I swore if I relapsed I would do something different: TSM AA something. I hope I find a way to get this under control. I don't want to die.

Yesterday is my new day. I won't even call it a reset anymore it's the day I want to always remember as the day that changed my life. You are not alone. I've been doing this for way too long and guess what? I always end up in the same place filled with anxiety and fear. Fuck alcohol. I'm embracing my sobriety with open arms and a new beginning.

I know how you feel right now. I'm on day 2 I'm angry I'm upset. All we can do is get back on the good wave. And stay this time. We CAN beat this addiction.
