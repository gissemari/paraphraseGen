I have to admit I did not **believe** I would make it past three weeks but as Craig Beck says the word **"LIE"** is right in the middle of the word to remind you that what you believe about alcohol is just that. On Friday the 29th of January I downed about 10 strong beers and smoked myself nearly to death between about 6pm-11pm then passed out...Here are just a few random points that I hope to use to remind myself and maybe they might provide some thinking points for others:..- **The 'Conscious' Mind** (aka the Ego); You can identify when it may be leading you astray. Understand it thinks it can run your life **but it cannot**. It lives in a constant state of fear it makes you doubt yourself it want's you to drink to keep you *stop the tape* trapped in the loop to keep so you pause the tape and the feelings you try to hide collect and back up and then overwhelm and then you want to drink more (i.e. depression?). ..- **The 'Subconscious' mind:** It's amazing!!! it's the route to your soul; it requires a long time to reprogram and you need to allow it space and time (which alcohol removes) along with providing it with the information that fundamentally changes your perception of alcohol...- **Influence & Planning;** Assess any situation in advance that may have the slightest possibility of purchasing or being able to have an alcoholic drink. For example; If going to your local shop run through in your mind multiple times going in buying just what you need paying and walking out; or if going out with other people have an 'escape plan'. If for any situation you cannot envisage running through that scenario without buying/accepting a drink then scrap the plan and find an alternative or reject the scenario (I turned a long term school friend down from meeting in our local town where we would pub crawl and get smashed; I could tell he wasn't overly pleased with this but the next day we did an activity which did not involve drinking and it was good; your true friends will emerge from these decisions). ..- **Routine**: find something however small to interrupt the times you would have started drinking. e.g. I go straight to the gym after work now and at weekends mid afternoons. If you have downtime I read SD listen to audiobooks go for a drive or just snooze/go to bed call someone arrange a meeting with friends or family dust off some old equipment from hobbies you had forgotten about. ..- **Boredom:** I accept it is possible to feel bored but I feel:  .a) This is a potential **excuse** it's your ego trying to lead you back to drinking  .b) you do not always have to be doing something downtime for your mind is healthy (i see quite bit of people mentioning meditation on SD and while I don't officially do that I often sit for an hour or two chilling with a cup of tea and just thinking).  .c) I believe as you get further into sobriety your mind naturally starts to 'do things' to learn to recover educate and entertain; it takes some time for the repression caused by long term alcohol abuse to start abating and your brain to start reconnecting with the 'normal' word around it.  . .- **Be realistic** and keep things in perspective. The first week is liberating and exciting after so many dark years but personally I need to bring myself back down (not least because I often extended natural heights by boozing). You should most definitely praise yourself for taking control and making the decision; but as we know with this disease it can only take a split second for things to change; so I just try and remind myself that this is my 'normal' state. Being an alcoholic is/was not my normal state. ..- **Don't overthink things**; I know it's a bit ironic given all the babble above but in the end all the above really boils down to is; "I don't drink anymore". Personally I know announcing I'm an alcoholic to people I know (even close family) is likely to add pressure which will more likely lead to a relapse and that's the other thing; I could relapse I don't want to but I could. Staying in the present moment and not being lead astray by the Ego is not easy. It's my problem and no-one elses (with all due respect to them I don't believe anyone in my family or friends who still drinks a fair bit would either accept I am an alcoholic nor wish to accept it because of their own fears regarding alcohol). .....it's coming together making more sense getting a little easier. I'm looking forward to my 5th Monday!

Great post. I agree that it does get easier and feel more normal with each passing day.  Your last point is very true.   My family and friends ( the few that I have told) cannot grasp that I have a bad relationship with alcohol.  The less explaining I do the easier it is. Good luck. 
My ego is not my amigo....
