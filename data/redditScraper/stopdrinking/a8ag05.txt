Hello fellow travelers.  I am starting day 4 and woke up feeling good. Daily AA meetings are on my agenda. I'm retired so time management is essential. I am a relapser and  closet drinker  and my last quit date was initiated by being  busted  by my wife and adult son.  Much at stake nor in my family relationships but if I have learned anything from my past attempts to quit (11 years in one instance before release) it is that I must quit and remain sober for myself. Any other benefits are bonus points..Thank you all for sharing your experience strength and hopes.  Bless you all.  I will not drink with you today
