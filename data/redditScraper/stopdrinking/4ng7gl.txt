24 days seems like seconds some times. I know its an accomplishment to be sober for several weeks now. Most days I do not even see the number as I am busy. But when I do... I read several posts about people relapsing after several months or even many months (9). I think geeze... What a struggle it can be. That is what makes me feel small. My only comfort is knowing that alcohol is smaller. Sober today.

Sober today is a great way to think about this. Enjoy your day!
That's a great comfort though! I won't drink with you today.
&gt;My only comfort is knowing that alcohol is smaller...I imagine the cravings being this incapable pathetic creature Gollum from Lord of the Rings. He can't do anything without my help can't drive can't buy wine. In other words I imagine the cravings whine and complain and shout but I don't have to do anything.  Need to kill the creature's food source otherwise it will kill me first.
