I actively and intetentionally stopped drinking for over 100 days and saved alot of money and felt a whole lot better. I meant to relapse for new years since me and my close friend group often only have 4 - 8 meetings per year so new years is one of those occasions (new years) is a big impact event for me. Totally not worth it. im thinking this year i'll limit myself to 2-3 total execessive alcohol events per year. I personally saved $50 per week x 14 weeks = 700 for 3.5months or approx 175-250$ per month or over the span of a year can equate to $3000 + but for me i saved approx. $750-$1000 in the period i stopped. for me not drinking has more to do with the financial benefits than physical or social benefits of sobriety. Whatever the reason for not drinking sobriety pays off in real $$$.

I failed after 4 months and regret it. I hadn't fixed my life in that time. Was bound to happen. Disappointing but I'm in a better place now. Fortunately we never have to drink again.
