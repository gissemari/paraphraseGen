Life is definitely easier to handle when you're sober.  My girlfriend and I have broken up.  A big part of that is because of the stress my drinking and general inability to care for myself caused.  But that's ok.  I know I have a long road of healing ahead of me that feels like it needs to be done alone.  ..I'm feeling good this time around.  I finally read This Naked Mind.  I'm thinking about the drink differently as a result.  I'm staying away from alcohol fueled events and trying to focus on what I want out of life.  ..It took me a lot of tries to this year to get past 2 or 3 days but I'm glad I stuck with it.  By the time I made it to 14 days I felt like a new man and after getting into This Naked Mind I felt A LOT less anxious about the sober road ahead.  ..Biggest thing I realized while reading the book.  ..I don't want to drink.  Before I always thought I wanted to drink and would have to struggle to not for the rest of my life.  In truth I don't want to and I have good reason not to.  Once I realize that it's not such a struggle to say no.  ..I used to convince myself that I was missing out on something and needed force of will to say no.  As it turns out I've been missing out on life because I've been poisoning myself.  I had it flipped around.  Once that struggle was resolved things made sense.  I don't want to drink so I'm not going to.  Not today.
