My last post was so popular I decided to keep up the tradition. ..During my first attempt at sobriety it was not only the alcohol I struggled with I was also addicted to marijuana. That was my go to drug my friend every single day. I smoked marijuana for ten years and only stopped for one 12-day stretch to see if I could (I couldn't). I was 28 when I realized I had a problem and was an addict 29 before I decided to quit and 30 when I made my first attempt. Three years. Let me say that again three years...I was in a panic because I decided to quit. I hadn't actually quit yet but I was still literally having panic attacks just because I had THOUGHT about quitting. How ridiculous is that!? I remember one such attack specifically. I was visiting my parents house having just come from a Jiu-jitsu class when I felt it set on me like a rabid dog. ..I had been thinking about quitting for an hour when my chest tightened sweat started pouring down my face and I started pacing the living room. My parents noticed this right away and started asking questions which only made it worse. I started to blurt out my insane mussing's about how hard life was going to be without alcohol and marijuana. ..How was I going to live my life without partaking in marijuana? No drinking at wedding's holiday's birthday's or any other celebration? How the fuck do you go see a movie at the theater with out being high?!? It just was inconceivable beyond my comprehension. The fact was that I had determined that this decision would result in me NEVER having fun EVER again. Life was going to SUCK. At this time I didn't know about SMART Recovery and the ABC`s especially the DISPUTE part. ..SMART Recovery ABC's..A-ctivating event - What is the Activating event? What happened? What did I.do? What did others do? What idea occurred to me? What emotions was I feeling? ..C-onsequence - Am I feeling anger depression anxiety frustrated self-pity etc.? Am I behaving in a way that doesn't work for me? (drinking attacking .moping etc.) . .B-eliefs - Beliefs (dysfunctional) What do I believe about the Activating event? Which of my beliefs are my helpful/self-enhancing beliefs and which are my .dysfunctional/self-defeating beliefs? ..D-ispute - Dispute the Beliefs to find which are dysfunctional What is the evidence that my belief is true? In what ways is my belief helpful or unhelpful? .What helpful/self-enhancing belief can I use to replace each self-defeating or dysfunctional belief? ..E-ffective New Belief and Emotional Consequence - What helpful/self-enhancing new belief can I use to replace each self-defeating or dysfunctional belief? What are my new feelings? ..To be brutally honest life did suck for awhile. I no longer had the crutch of my addiction my wife marijuana and my best friend alcohol. The pain was real I felt it for the first time in years. I had to actually deal with my problems and consequences of my actions...Slowly though things began to change but it was rough. I had to deal with legal trouble. I left my hometown to run from more trouble. I spent months traveling the US and finding work. Three months later I was in Humboldt County California when I broke. Being in such a famous place was too much and I lost my will to fight. My wife marijuana came back into my life. More time would pass before I broke the spell she had over me...Fun did happen though much to my surprise. In fact I learned that with sobriety it brought clarity. I could enjoy the great things even MORE because I was much more aware. I remembered party's because I was not black out drunk by the end. I didn't have to apologize to anyone for my rude behavior. The quality friends the people I respected started to invite me to their events once again. That my friends is having fun...Edit: Clarity punctuation spelling. .
