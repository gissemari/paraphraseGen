It's been almost a year since I started taking my drinking seriously. I've been in and out of AA programs and therapist in that year. I've relapsed and hit very high highs and very low lows. ..Today was a high. ..I went to my usual AA meeting today during my lunch break from work. Today was different though. I picked up a one month chip. After work I met my girlfriend for dinner and went to my favorite record store. My day wasn't over. ..Tonight I started my IOP (intensive outpatient program) for my alcohol and substance addiction. I was scared and nervous walking in but quickly realized everyone in that room was someone who wanted to better themselves and had made both a mental and financial (it's not cheap) priority to sobriety. Looking forward to the weeks to come and am hopeful for the future. ..Thank you for giving me a space to share.

Big win of a day. This may be too simplistic but I think a lot of us are either going in one direction or the other. You're going in the right direction  . Thanks for sharing!
Excellent. Great job!
