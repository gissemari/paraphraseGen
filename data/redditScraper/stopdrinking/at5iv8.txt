Sorry for the stupid title I just don't know how else to sum up what I'm feeling. ..Basically I've been wanting to quit drinking for a long time but I get tempted and inevitably get way too drunk about once a week. Right now I've been sober since Saturday. ..I've been drinking since I was 14. Aside from a few binging periods I don't drink daily; mostly just weekends or on vacation. The problem I have is the stuff I do or say when I drink which can be anything from getting in fist fights with my family oversharing sleeping with total strangers and just generally hitting the self destruct button. ..Aside from regretting all of that and feeling very embarrassed I've recently entered a professional field and I'm really scared my drunken behaviour is going to come back and bite me in the ass. ..I try not to eat before I drink so that I'll get really messed up - the only time I don't drink way too much is if I've been forced by circumstances to have a big dinner in which case I'm super grumpy with whoever I'm with and don't enjoy myself. I can't really stop once I start and I do not know how to pace myself. I have talked about this with my therapist and she tried to help me with harm reduction techniques like have an escape plan mix water in etc but I can't seem to stick to it. ..I guess my doubts arise when I think about how other people including my dad drink every single day - and the voice inside my head is like you don't really have a problem just say less stupid shit when you drink. I don't know if it's my brain trying to trick me into keep drinking or if I'm not really an alcoholic just a dumbass. ..My friend group has two incredibly heavy drinkers and when I told them I was concerned about my drinking they downplayed it. My friend's exact words were  I WISH I only drank a 26er of vodka every weekend.  It just made me feel kind of stupid for thinking I might have a problem. ..Anyone else struggling with this? Any insight is appreciated.

 *I just ruin my life every time I drink without fail.* ..I think maybe that's the answer to your question...Annie Grace's online 30 day alcohol free experiment helped me break my daily habit.  I'm sure it would be helpful to anyone who is struggling with alcohol...Personally I finally gave up trying to explain to family and friends what I've been going through.  They simply cannot relate...iwndwyt
I never considered myself an alcoholic but an alcohol abuser or misuser. You don't need to belong anywhere or in any category with any label. If you think drinking is a problem for you then it is a problem for you. Most of us struggle with this here and your friends don't know what you're thinking and don't want to know what you're thinking with regards to drinking too much. You'll see the phrase one is too many and one thousand isn't enough here which describes the situation for most of us...Not drinking makes things so much easier and if you're struggling now chances are that the struggle is only going to become worse and that much more difficult to kick. Sobriety is a difficult  journey within yourself and one that is very personal. The struggle is real but it can be overcome.
I jive with so much of this but I do drink daily atm. I think there's a distinction between being an alcoholic and having a drinking problem. I am currently trying and failing to work through not wanting to drink at all but still drinking daily--I'm an alcoholic. You don't have that dilemma but if you don't fix your problem now you could wind up in my shoes. The "easy" solution is to stop drinking but if you're not committed it's not going to happen. You might want to try keeping a journal recording what you've done drunk and what you do in the future to look to if your resolve to quit strengthens. Other than that you just need to make more of an effort to be mindful when you drink. If you don't like having water between drinks or limiting how much you drink because it's get drunk or be unhappy I really think the best thing you can do for yourself is not drink at all before you wind up like me. I used to only drink occasionally and rarely but too often to excess and it costed me almost literally all my friends. So something to keep yourself from crossing lines before it's too late if you don't want to quit. It'll just be harder if you continue down the path you're on
I hate the term alcoholic because it's pretty useless. It has no 1 standard definition so everyone's own interpretation always seems to exclude their own drinking habits somehow. And it's the only thing we feel we need a label before it gets bad enough to warrant doing something about. It just creates separation and "us vs them". Not useful.....&gt;Inevitably get way too drunk about once a week..Whoops that's problematic.....&gt;getting in fist fights with my family getting in domestics with my ex oversharing sleeping with total strangers and just generally hitting the self destruct button. ..So out of control drinking and agressive/risky behavior?..&gt;I try not to eat before I drink so that I'll get really messed up..Been there...I was counting calories after all and God forbid I give up a beer instead of lunch..&gt;I can't really stop once I start and I do not know how to pace myself..That's common with addictive substances it's a biological/chemical thing...&gt;harm reduction techniques like have an escape plan mix water in etc but I can't seem to stick to it..I never could stick to my rules either..&gt;I don't know if it's my brain trying to trick me into keep drinking or if I'm not really an alcoholic just a dumbass..Sounds like an addiction gremlin talking! See above note about the uselessness of 'alcoholic'. And besides you can be both it's not either or ;)..&gt;My friend group has two incredibly heavy drinkers and when I told them I was concerned about my drinking they downplayed it. .Not surprising addicts like to hang around other addicts and normalize the insane consumption. Plus if YOU have a problem that probably means THEY have a problem and they'd rather not think about that so of course you don't have a problem (in their mind). Doesn't mean that's reality...&gt;I just ruin my life every time I drink without fail..Whelp. The longer I get from my last drink the more I realize any hesitations I had about living a sober life were totally unfounded. And I don't worry I'm actively making everything 100% harder for myself...And lastly I think it's telling that you sought out a stop drinking sub and posted to it. I have never once wondered or felt compelled to look up a "stop eating cake" subreddit or something.
