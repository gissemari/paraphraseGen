My struggle with maintaining sobriety continues. In the last few months I would say things have gotten better. I no longer drink alone or keep alcohol in the house. I can easily go 10 12 days without drinking. When I do drink it's not to blackout. I have been able to cut myself off at 4 drinks. Five I have noticed puts me in hangover territory. I only drink with my boyfriend and only when we are out. But I still don't like how much I look forward to it and I still want to quit. I don't like the money and time spent or the weight gain. At least I feel better about not embarrassing myself and not feeling sick. Ugh. Baby steps.

I couldn't maintain sobriety without lots of help. I started by getting a therapist who nudged me onto the road to recovery. AA meetings put me in touch with people who understood and who also wanted to stop drinking. I felt less alone and seeing others with long-term sobriety gave me hope. Sobriety is easier and more fun with a support system.
