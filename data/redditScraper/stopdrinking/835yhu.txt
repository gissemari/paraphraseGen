I relapsed. I am not going to drink again. Staying sober has now become the thing I need to do. My current SO is making that super difficult. I feel sick to my stomach at the thought of going home. I have been nervous around him for awhile. But my anxiety when I am around him has gotten so bad that I constantly feel like I am on the verge of a panic attack. I wish I could leave the lease but I don't have the money. And I can't make him leave. Emotionl abuse sucks but nobody is going to kick him out of the house because he constantly criticizes me. Our lease is up in June. Anyone have any good anxiety tips. Stop panic attacks tips?

Whatever it takes to get you to day 121  
Can you at least move into a separate room so you have a sanctuary space? 
This is a shot in the dark but any possibility of seeking medical attention and getting into sober living?..I'm sorry you're going through this. Wishing you strength :).
Alcohol fuels anxiety. After I quit drinking I no longer suffer from panic attacks. Anxiety will decrease if you manage not to drink...
I don't know what's available to you but I'm in Canada and in the past made use of a women's domestic abuse shelter because I needed it.  They were *very* helpful.  It was free.  It was a lifesaver for me.
