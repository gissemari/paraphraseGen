So around April I decided to quit (it had been a long time coming) and then I went 75 days.  I had a conference to attend and I knew the open bars and free drinks would be too hard to pass up (this was my thinking) so I decided to start drinking a few days before so the conference wouldn't be the first time I drank.  So fast forward 5 weeks and I haven't missed a day of drinking since.  Then 3 days ago I refocused and quit again.  This was a great lesson for me as I realized I'm only in control when I'm not drinking at all it's too hard to turn it on and off.  I want to be a social drinker I want to enjoy moderation but I think I have to accept that the best I can be is social.  looking forward to breaking my 75 day record (and beyond!)

I'm right there with you. It took me more failed attempts than it probably should have to realize that moderation just isn't for me...It makes sense if you think about it. Moderating requires mental work calculating and projecting drinks throughout the week that sort of thing. Much simpler to just not drink...Best of luck in breaking your 75 day record! I bet you'll smash it =)
I hear you. I want so badly to be a social drinker! I miss the days of being a social drinker! Or at least I miss my nostalgia-skewed view. But alas something shifted along the way and I cannot moderate. I tell myself I can and it lasts awhile then the downward spiral. Yadda yadda yadda much simpler to just not drink. Good luck!
