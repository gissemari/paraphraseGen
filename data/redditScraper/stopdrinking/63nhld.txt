I finally FINALLY managed to take my recycling to the recycling center and it contained the last couple weeks of my last relapse. I thought there would be a few liquor bottles in there but there were about two dozen. Gross...Got a lot on my plate. Facing an extremely stressful life change. Pretty darned lost. The most lost I've been as an adult. But I know I need a change. And I know drinking won't help any part of it...So I'm not drinking today and turn my eyes to Day 50.

Drinking only adds more to the plate it doesn't make anything on the plate more palatable. I'll be here not drinking with you. You'll never regret waking up sober on day 50!
You are doing so great im not drinking with you either   
Way to go!
