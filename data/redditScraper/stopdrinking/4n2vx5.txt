I've had a few good runs.  Actually spent 6 out of the past 14 months sober on a 110 day run and a 68 day run.  But low and behold I lost it again a few months ago and really screwed some stuff up in my life quickly!.Just wanted to post as a reminder to folks that testing moderation at least in my experience is depressing destructive dangerous and even scary...I'm looking back at the year and trying to learn from the stresses that triggered my relapses and what I can do differently so I can sit here and write a 1 year post this time next year.....Thanks for listening.

Thanks for the post. Six sober! Even if it wasn't all at one stretch it shows commitment. I would love to have a year sobriety. :) But I prefer to think of it as just one day.. this day.
I needed to find a replacement coping mechanism (or several) to replace drinking as a response to stressors and then practice those replacement behaviour(s).  I find _________-ing instead of drinking is easier than it is to just "don't drink."  I fill in the blank with: breath meditate talk to my sponsor or band of brothers go to a meeting and share run yoga nature walk or whatever recovery practices you are working on.  My focus is on the replacement beaviour not the replaced.  You have proven you can stop drinking for one day and many times in a row.  What's left is to do so in the face of life's more challenging adversities.  If you are open to it Steps 4 through 9 are designed to relieve residual historical stressors.
That little voice has been getting in my head the last week or so. "You got this. You don't really have a problem. You can have a glass of wine tonight with dinner."..While you may feel defeated your sharing this has helped me. Thank you so much for being brave enough to be both open about what happened and coming back to fight the good fight again. And reminding me why I am here.
I was reading a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/4mqlvs/is_relapse_a_part_of_recovery/d3xn72n) by fellow sobernaut u/OspreySoaring and he mentioned stumbling forward into sobriety. I like that. For some of us and that definitely includes me I have stumbled and taken quite a few falls throughout my recovery. But it's my newfound hindsight that helps me move forward with different tactics and with excitement. Glad you can look back reflect and find some new goals to work toward.
