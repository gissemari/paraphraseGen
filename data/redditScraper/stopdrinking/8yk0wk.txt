Any advice how to NEVER do this again? 
The most important thing for you to do now is figure out why you relapsed and how you will prevent it in the future.  Moping about it won't help you so don't.  It's good that you feel like shit but don't use that as an excuse not to put the work in.

look at it this way in the past 90 some days all you did was have half a can of something.  Isn't that great?  Keeping track of the days is a good motivator but not if it makes you feel bad for actually having achieved something great.  Keep going.  Pretty soon you will get to say in the past 100 days all i had was one half a can of something.  
I got sober in AA...I can't understand why people white knuckle it when they can have help.
Other my disagree with me... but my advice? Let it go and keep on truckin! The old you would've drank many more so you still accomplished something last night! You didn't get drunk!! ..Don't obsess. That half drink isn't shit compared to your months of sobriety! The only place that this lesson will serve you is the next time you're tempted. Are you at a bachelorette party now? (Hopefully not). So put a nice bow on that guilt put it on the shelf and don't look back (until the next time you're tempted)...For me sobriety is a process. I'm only on day 12 and I anticipate I may slip at some point but I don't necessarily believe that erases all of your progress. the worst thing for me is to obsess... that gives alcohol more power. ..There's an old adage: you can't keep a bird from flying over your head but you can keep it from building a nest in you hair. ..Focus on today!
