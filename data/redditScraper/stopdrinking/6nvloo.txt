I'm still unsure about how I feel about counting my sobriety days..Counting down or indeed upwards implies to me that there's an endpoint or a line to cross. .In my mind I crossed the line when I stopped and counting will do nothing but focus on what I'm moving away from..The conflict in my head is that I don't want to focus or make alcohol important in my every day life though similarly realise that I must stay vigilant to avoid relapse traps. .Does anyone else have thoughts on this?.I'm absolutely all for doing whatever works for each individual and certainly aren't knocking the counters or counting method if it works for you just trying to find my own way and what will work for me..Proud of everyone in team SD together we are strong..I will not drink with you today.
