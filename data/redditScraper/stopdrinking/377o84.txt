Hi all.I had about one month sober from mid-February to mid-March and blew it.  I missed a good friend's bridal shower yesterday because I was busy withdrawing.  So here I am crawling back with a clean slate and ready to change the things that I messed up the first time...I don't remember the exact day I relapsed but I started dating a new guy and I know this is a big no-no.  I guess my loneliness got the best of me.  I think I'm starting to fall for him and I don't want to pull away but if that's what it is going to take I need to consider it.  He is one of the most supportive and real people I've ever met so I think he'd support me.  But I'm trying not to worry about that right now and focus on being sober.  ..I really hit hard last weekend when I found out about the death of a guy I had only briefly dated but had touched my life in the short time I knew him.  He was an addict too and lived a reckless lifestyle and it sounds like it got the best of him.  I felt guilt for that because our last interaction was not a pleasant one.  ..I need to work on my coping skills.  I lost my grandpa my dog and now a friend in the last 2 months.  I don't think I properly grieved and I'm trying to look inside myself and figure out what I have such an issue with that.  Masking it with alcohol obviously isn't working.  ..I've started swimming again which has been really good for me.  I did it since I was a kid but hadn't hit the pool much since I graduated college.  I have been to AA and while not opposed to it I'm not sure it's for me.  However it's always in my toolbox and it's comforting to know it's always there as an option.  For now I'm posting here  and you all can find me in the IRC chat - I really missed you all SD!  I'm not drinking today.  And that's the first part of my plan.

Welcome back!..That sounds like a rough two months.  I had a period of a few months were I lost a great uncle a friend (29 years old) my father then my cat and my elderly dog.  I'm pretty sure I drank myself stupid after each incident.  I never did deal with the grief because with all the substances in my body I wasn't letting my brain process anything.  Losing some of those people really haunted me and I wasn't able to reason it or let go for a long while.  I wish I had dealt with all that soberly so I didn't have to carry it around with me for so long.  I didn't even realize how badly it was affecting me because of the masking it with alcohol and other stuff.  I hope you find healthy ways of coping that work for you.  Journaling and talking to a therapist ultimately helped me but I'm still working on my healthy coping skills.  ..I'm so happy you're not drinking today.  I'm not either! 
I'm sorry for your troubles.  Sounds like a lot of loss all at once.  I have never lost a close friend but I have lost a dog and know how painful that is.  And a dog is such a comfort I can see where you might turn to other dangerous comforts.  I am rooting for you Lipstick!
