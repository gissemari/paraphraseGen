Small accomplishment but it feels good. After a recent relapse with 8 years sober. This is only the 2nd time I've gotten 30 days in the last 6 months. I'm doing it right this time.

My tag is wrong. Lol
I find that my badge sitting there counting my days is a huge motivator for me as well. It works for me- it helps to have a reminder of how many days I have and challenges me on how many more I can tell alcohol that it doesn't have any business over here! :)
30 days is no small step friend :D congrats!
I still count the days. Each is a mini-milestone for me as it reps the longest ever without alcohol.
I like my day counts too .Congrats on 30
I like counting days so much I have two sobriety counting apps on my phone!
I like seeing my number also. Congrats to you!
