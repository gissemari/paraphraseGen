I recently made my first post here..(https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/5ws7jx/im_scared/).It is about how I was scared to stop drinking how I knew I had a problem but didn't know if I could fix it. And it gave a little bit og my drug and drinking background. .Since then I have been seeing a counselor on my university campus met with her 7 times in a month with two more scheduled for this week. I also met with a psychiatrist and a physician. I was prescribed an antidepressant and naltrexone which is supposed to help with cravings. ..With all this I have made some progress. I went six days of not drinking between counselor meetings once. That was the longest I had gone in a while. But I still fall back and drink. I tell myself it is comparatively better that is going from drinking twenty beers every night of the week to drinking fifteen beers four nights of the week. But I know that it isn't good. I need to stop cold turkey because if I drink I want to drink more. And if I drink one night it increases my desire to drink the next night exponentially. ..I'm not sure what to do from here. I can't seem to not drink even with the support and outside help I am getting. I want so badly to not have had a drink for a year for next Easter but I also can't even begin to comprehend that. It seems so daunting. A week seems daunting. I guess I am really just fishing for encouraging words or hear stories from sober people about their journey or any other advice or anecdotes. How did you get started? How do you maintain sobriety? How do you deal with social situations when others are drinking? How do you refrain from relapsing? I just really don't want to drink anymore. I want to be sober. But I know it's a long hard journey.

It sounds to me that you are on the right track. You are getting medical and counseling support and have a strong desire. Also you did A LOT better this last week (60 compared to 140 beers if I multiplied correctly). You can focus on this huge early success and build on that and stay hopeful!
That's me. I think I will have two beers. Or four beers. Eight beers and a few bowls of pot later I'm tanked and worthless the next day. ..As to what you are doing about it. Well you are here. And like ProfTumbleweed says you are getting support. That matters. I'm all for the one day at a time thing. As to night time I've always loved to read. That's hard to do when intoxicated so I found a book I knew that'd I'd love to read and that's what I'm doing. Maybe find something to distract yourself during those times you'd drink?
