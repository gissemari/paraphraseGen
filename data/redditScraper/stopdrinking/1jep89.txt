We have been together for 9 years and his drinking problem started about a year and a half ago.  He has been hiding it and I finally told him that whatever has been causing tension and him being distant needed to come out or I would leave.  He finally owned up to it and said he's ready to quit and that he was afraid to admit it because he didn't want to stop.....He doesn't want our friends and family to know and says he doesn't need professional help.  I'm ok with not letting people we know in on it it's personal and it's his journey and his choice....but I'm worried about the professional help part.  He has been struggling at work and I know if he's going to an AA (or something similar) even once a month if he has issues with withdrawals and it affects his work he'll be able to avoid getting fired over it but I'm not going to force him into anything he doesn't want to do.....I'm also wondering if there are any resources for me?  I don't have anyone to lean on for this.  I'm not going to lie to him about the emotions I'm having but I don't want my feelings to be the priority.  I don't want to talk to him about my being scared every day I don't want him to hide how he's feeling because he's worried about how I'll react......I'm just really scared.

Withdrawal lasts a week usually less.  Going to AA meetings isn't going to save him from being fired from his job...Almost nobody *wants* professional help particularly those who need it most.  But then not everyone needs professional help.  So why not do this - if he's dead set on doing it on his own give him the chance.  But ask him to agree that if he tries for X amount of time and is unable to quit on his own he'll give professional help or AA meetings or SMART meetings or whatever a shot.  You can't force him to do anything he doesn't want to do so this is really more about you.  "BF I love you and want to be with you but I don't want to be in a relationship with a drunk.  I can't help you if you won't help yourself.  So try it your way try to quit on your own I'll support you.  But if what you're doing isn't working I need you to admit it and seek help. Or I'm going to have no choice but to leave because I can't live like this."..For you [see the section here entitled "For concerned family members."](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index#wiki_for_concerned_family_members)..Best wishes.
PLEASE go to Al-Anon please.

/r/alanon..This is the door to alanon.  It is the resource you need..Being in your position is incredibly hard.  You are forcing the issue which is good but his reaction his response are unpredictable and out of your hands...However you are forcing the issue for yourself which is the healthy thing to do.   Good luck.
Al-anon is the same religious preaching as AA so if thats an issue for you don't go there.  Just listen to him ask him how you can help but also give him enough space to work through parts of it alone.  Contrary to what most people in this sub think a drinking problem cab definitely be overcome on your own if you focus on building positive habits and discipline(I know I know willpower is a dirty word around here but some people actually do have it).
