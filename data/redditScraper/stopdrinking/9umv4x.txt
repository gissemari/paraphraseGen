First time posting though been lurking for a while. On my 3rd go at sobriety getting better at it each time if that makes sense? Anyway I'm on day 9 and have managed to negotiate a cascade of triggers this long weekend without wavering. My husband is in a band so we're regularly at pubs and the alcohol is free. Unless you count the price of your dignity/self-respect in which case the alcohol is very expensive. .So despite having ample opportunity to drink including the kids at their grandparents for the night free alcohol hotel and no work I instead volunteered to be designated driver and watched everyone else get messy whilst (slightly smugly) thinking about how I WASN'T going to 1) be hungover 2) struggle to remember conversations 3) worry that I'd embarrassed myself 4) wonder if there was photographic evidence to avoid/untag. Instead I slept soundly woke up feeling rested read a book had a coffee and enjoyed a quiet morning. It's the simple things like this that are the subtle reminders that I'm making the right decision even though it's hard (especially given the pub scene I'm inevitably part of). IWNDWYT

Sounds nice! So sad I can't drink coffee. Even decaf messes up my stomach. I'll live it through your cozy description. 
Sounds like you had a good time! Was the music good? Lol
