after 6 months sobriety I relapsed. I figure I'm a late stage alcoholic. I basically drink until I black out. Every tool I was given and everything things I learned did not stop me from going down this dark path again. ..Drinking for me isn't even about having fun anymore I do it alone. I feel like shit. It's like my brain is now wired to go straight to suffering...I was walking down the street today and envying all the sober people just going about their day...I now have to try and ween myself off because I don't have health insurance to go back to the ER.

I too feel I am a late stage alcoholic friend. I have the same experience of it going straight to pain and exclusively drinking alone (wouldn't want to be around others while drinking even if I could). I am also a blackout drinker and boy does it hurt to drink and get so so sick. It has even gotten to the point where I feel sick from drinking much less. I have a day but haven't blackout drank in about two weeks. Been drinking a beer or a shot every couple days (new for me always drank to total blackout but I've been so frightened of dying from drinking its kept me drinking practically nothing still not fully sober though). So just know that I know what its like to feel that you are at a tipping point staring down a dark path...You didn't specify how long you've been relapsed. If its been heavy drinking for a while than an ER visit or a trip to the doctor may be worth the money. The ER shouldn't cost more than 1000 dollars and if you tell them hey I've got no money when talking to the billing department they usually can work something out. Your life is worth more than 1000 dollars and if that is what it takes to break a cycle your in and keep you from having a dangerous hangover and withdrawal than it is worth it...Not drinking today for me and I hope you can stop drinking mate. Know that i'm feeling for you and hoping you can get in good health and get some relief and peace of mind. 
I relapsed for 10 years after a long period of sobriety. During the last few years of it I drank alone with my dogs and cats after my husband had gone to work. By evening I'd either be a raging lunatic or passed out. Half the time I'd be in a black out or brown out state (remembering bits and pieces). I didn't have health insurance but one day I had had enough and went to AA where I found a few people to latch onto. Quite frankly I was miserable for a good while but the period of misery was worth getting to some level of acceptance. If possible it might helpful to find a clinic or sliding scale facility to at least monitor the withdrawals.
Being honest with my doctor led to getting medication for safer and easier detox. The money saved from not drinking can easily pay for an office visit. See also HAMS Reduction.
Before I quit part of me thought quitting drinking would solve all my problems. ..Quitting drinking did indeed solve some of the negative in my life but I didn't "solve all of my problems". That took work. I can't offer specific advice because I'm not a doctor/psychologist and I don't know your situation but if I was using alcohol to medicate a problem something existed before the alcohol. ..With a freedom from the slavery of daily drinking I had time and clarity to actually work on myself. I'm still a work in progress that's for sure but I now know that alcohol wasn't fixing anything and mostly made things worse for me. ..My advice to you is to focus again on what worked to get initially sober and then start trying to work on yourself somehow. White knuckle it out to get beyond the physical grasp of alcohol then battle the mind issues. ..There are happy days ahead you can do it!
Why do you have to go to the ER????? Just because you drank one day does not mean you didn't stay sober for 6 months!!!! It's just ONE hiccup. You can do this!!!!!!
At age 28 I was told by an ER doctor that I wouldn't live to see 30 if I didn't change something. At that point drinking had lost all of its fun all of its romance it was just something that I **had** to do to keep from being horribly ill/dying. I would no longer get the pleasant buzz that I used to chase daily. I realized that I was at a *late* **late** stage in my drinking and that I had (maybe) once last chance to save myself. I didn't know how and I sure as hell didn't have the money but I started by **asking for help.** Then I kept asking. And asking. Even today I make sure to ask for help when I feel overwhelmed and the thought of "maybe drinking would help?" pops into my head.
6 months is 6 months you didn't have 6 months ago. Win...You fell off. It happens. I won't question if you feel you need an E.R. or doctor's advice to climb back on. ..I don't know that the stages of alcoholism /subjectively/ matter. Yes. That is how you drink. It's an upper metric but the lower metric doesn't change no matter how much you drink. It's always gonna be zero. ..If you did it for 6m you can do it again for 6m. That's better than anywhere you were at before...You can do that you already did once.
I get it.  I too relapsed after a long period of sobriety.  Been trying for 5 years now to get back to a long period of sobriety.  I have trouble making it past 3 weeks.  However I do know that when I do drink I am only along for the ride and who knows where the circus that is my drinking is going to go.  The shitty thing is that I could lose big.  However my problem is that I am basically powerless over the drink.  I have to say that trying to solve this inability to control my drinking will not get done by my willpower.  I am active in AA and the only thing that helps me is seeking the spiritual solution.  That is hard for an Atheist like me however I like the fact that the higher power is mine to define even if I don't attach it to any God or religion.  My sponsor gave me some sage advice.  Make "God" a verb as in a living loving energy that is in you in all things and is active in all things at all times.  I really believe the only thing that will help me at this point is a spiritual solution whatever form that may take.  However this may not be for you but I just wanted to toss that out as I have personally been where you are right now and honestly had nothing to lose.
