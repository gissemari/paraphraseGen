He handled it so well didn't make a huge deal out of it and helped me set up goals and rewards for making my milestones. He said for every three months I stick with it we'll go out for dinner somewhere nice and celebrate. He also suggested I keep a record of how I feel right now (always tired anxious emotional/depressed thoughts etc...) and then look back in a year and see how things have changed. I was so worried about speaking to him about this but he just wants me to be happy and healthy and strong. I wanted to share this story in case by reading this anyone else felt a boost of courage to seek help. There is help for everyone out there please go find it if you are hurting you don't need to struggle alone   .

That's huge. A little encouragement and support can go so far. A lot of encouragement and support do so much more:) Keep going!
I'm so happy for you. Having the support of those close to you will help and I think keeping a log of how you feel now to reflect upon later is a great idea. Best of luck! 
The support you have at home sounds like they want you to succeed at this. I also have support at home even though they still drink they still encourage me to do my very best. Good luck to you and let's don't drink together today.
That's good. Will you get help outside of your immediate network?
Hey I'm a little late but the app iMoodJournal is really good for tracking your mood. So happy you've taken a step towards bettering your life.
