I quit drinking after a long struggle a few relapses later I'm at about two and a half months. A big thing for me was that "partying" became code for drinking alone and isolating myself. Some party huh? For normies partying is a playful event and it's not that bad! For me it was the perfect masking buzzword. I won't drink with you all today!

I look forward to drinking wine alone at the end of a day. I think of it as a celebration or a party. I won't drink today.
Over 2 months calls for a party. Maybe a ice cream party. :-)
