So its been 2 weeks since i put the bottle down for good my first attempt and I must say... its been hellish hard. I have had back pains shakes sleepless nights nightmares hallucinations and more. I was scared at first and thought to myself 'how can I be doing this?' I realized that coming online everyday every-time i feel the urge to drink - reading your stories and understanding your struggles... calms me and inspires me. #Stopdrinking has been the best for me so far yes meetings have helped and i finally have 'The Big Book' but this site tops in my book! 2 weeks going strong thank you all. I am helping my mom step brother and a colleague at work too with this site - I will NOT drink today lets NOT drink together.
