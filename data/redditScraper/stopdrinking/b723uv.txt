Hi guys ..**TLDR:** Major depression making me want to drink after a long period of sobriety. Help. ..&amp;#x200B;..I am struggling with **bad cravings after a long time of not having any cravings**. I think this is due to major depression. ..From May 2016 - Aug 2018 I rarely even thought about alcohol. ..But then in **Aug 2018** I had a severe traumatic brain injury (**TBI**) after falling down a flight of stairs and cracking my skull. I was in the ICU for 4 days after this incident. When I got home I was in excruciating emotional pain for weeks because I had bruising on my frontal lobe. It was the deepest depression I'd ever experienced. It was the first time I'd ever seriously considered suicide. ..And because I was feeling impulsive from the brain injury I went out to the bar to numb my pain. **During a two week period I "slipped up" three times on drugs alcohol and cigarettes.** ..**But I promptly got right back on the wagon**. I immediately entered myself into an outpatient program at a local hospital because I had no interest in ruining my life. ..So from August of last year until now I have had relatively few cravings. That outpatient program was really helpful for me. I am working hard on myself. Going to therapy &amp; groups. Meditating nearly every day. Exercising. Eating healthy. Journaling. Using all my CBT tools. Etc. ..But despite this work I have entered another period of debilitating depression the last few weeks. It's taking me to scary places and interfering with my work. ..And the last few days I have been considering going to the corner store and getting a bottle and some cigarettes. I keep delaying myself from going. "If I still want it in 20 minutes then maybe then..." But this stalling is not going to work for much longer. I am hurting so bad and I just want it to stop. ..It's not so much that I want to actually drink. I like being sober. But I just want to go away for a little while. I just want to numb out for just a little bit and then come back and go back to my normal life. But I just need something anything to feel better for a little while. And then there is other part of me that doesn't have the courage to kill myself but just wants to self-destruct and/or play Russian Roulette w/substances. ..Does anyone have advice? Tips? Tricks? Personal experiences I can learn from? ..***(Please don't tell me to go to an AA meeting. I was in AA for a few months early on in my sobriety and I have very personal reasons for not continuing with it. Please respect that. Thank you.)***

Much much support for what you've been through and are doing OP. I have a couple of alcohol-induced suicide attempts in my history and I hear your words so deeply. What I do when I need to physically numb when I'm in unbearable pain is to go to sleep. I use a hypnosis tape if I can or Headspace's sleepcasts. This has been working pretty well for me. I also watch stand-up specials when I need to snap out of some thinking watched and ROFLed at Russell Brand's REBIRTH today...If I really need to do something impulsive and "destructive" I yell and punch my bed or crush a plastic bottle. ..I will not drink poison with you today no matter what happens.
UPDATE: I have been able to remain sober so far. Thanks for all your comments and DMs.
