I relapsed 40-50 days back really ashamed of myself. Was binge drinking 4-5 days a week sin e then. Then decided to quit once again 4 days back. Since then feeling way too much tired at work and when I come home I sleep immediately around 9.00 PM. Usually I used to sleep around 4.00 AM in the morning. Now I wake up around that. I'm worried because one of the symptoms of liver/kidney disease is tiredness. I've also started gym couple of days back. Not doing much there just strolling around to get used the environment this being my 4th attempt in joining a gym want to take it easy in me. My pee is clear shit is getting better everyday but still farting like a canon(bad smell) and I drink a lot of water. ..I'm also smoker. In my last attempt I tried to quit both at same time and hence failed miserably. This time I'll do it one by one. Coz binge drinking has scared the shit out of me.

I'm 8 days in since my last binge and I finally feel pretty good. Also if you just started working out that will wear you out quickly. Maybe give it a few more days and get as much sleep as possible. We beat our bodies up for years  so it makes sense it is going to take a bit to feel better. ..Also one thing I noticed in myself is that sobriety period after each relapse is different. Some better than others. Hopefully this will be the last time either of us has to go through this. 
You're just coming off a couple months of binge drinking being tired even after four days is not completely unexpected.  Please be gentle with yourself and go see a doctor if you're worried.
