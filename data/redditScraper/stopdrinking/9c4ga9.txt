... and I am not feeling confident at all. Trying to focus on the "Day One" positivity and not the self loathing that comes with the "Again" part. Bit of a lurker; this is my first proper post - hi all and thank you for sharing your journeys! I don't get to leave the house or talk to people very often and being able to read everybody's stories and encouraging attitudes has been remarkably helpful. After over fifteen years of struggling with daily alcoholism ptsd anxiety and all that other fun stuff I am finally in a position to address it all (I hope/think??) and alcohol is the biggest obstacle for me. If anybody has any reading material or internet suggestions it would be greatly appreciated. I'd like to find a buddhist or similar minded sobriety site/group but am having trouble. Thank you all and best of luck on your paths!

Welcome to posting!..I have super enjoyed Refuge Recovery which is Buddhist-based. The meditation and learning has helped me way beyond simply not drinking.
