I just started attending meetings back in February after a rather destructive night of drinking. I made it successfully to just over thirty days before stress and weakness caused me to relapse. It's been a challenge. I'm young enough that by catching it now I can hopefully prevent a lifetime of pain and suffering caused by alcohol. A good friend of mine who I am going to officially ask to be my sponsor showed me this sub Reddit and highly suggested that I use this as a tool for my recovery...I am officially counting the days down again as of today. I hope to find support here and can take wisdom from those of you with many days months and years of sobriety under your belts.

Welcome.  I started off reading Saturday Shares and Sunday Solutions and This Naked Mind.  They are all in the sidebar.  I won't drink with you today.
&gt;by catching it now I can hopefully prevent a lifetime of pain and suffering caused by alcohol..This is important to keep in mind.  The bad times snuck up on me so fast.  Years and years of getting away with maintaining a normal life while drinking heavily.  Suddenly all gave way and it hit me like a ton of bricks.
