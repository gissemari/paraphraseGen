Hi team long time lurker. Today is day two of being sober. I know that doesn't seem like a lot but I've never made it past day four after attempting to quit about 6 times now...Does anyone have tips for how not to relapse? ..Also what do you guys and girls use to help with withdrawals? I get really bad anxiety and headaches. ..Thanks love this sub.

Hi...just keep going  .I have stopped and started loads...this time it's forever I am just too bored with the same old stress and anxiety the wine witch brings me.  I know day 4 and 5 have been tough but I am coming on here getting huge positive support from lovely strangers and that is what you can have as well.  I will not drink with you today...or tomorrow as it's nearly bedtime here in the UK 
It is an achievement no matter what the days! Best of luck.. Get yourself well hydrated  find a non alcoholic drink like a sparkling water you like and be kind to yourself :)
When I was determined to stop the cycle I decided to try anything that had helped others quit before deciding it wasn't for me. That mindset brought me to AA meetings where I met happy sober people and felt hopeful for the first time in a long time. It ended up making the difference for me. Have you tried any kind of recovery group? AA is by far the biggest but there are many others these days. 
Try some thiamine (vitamin b1) and if you can see a doctor get a few days dose of Diazepam. A few years ago I quit for awhile with Dr assistance and thiamine Diazepam and gallon of water daily.  I also saw a substance abuse counselor.  For the last 4 months I have been trying and trying to be AF. Always relapsed within the first week.  So today I started the same plan.  I am very calm and relaxed.  I have a few days off of work so I am going to follow this plan as it was successful for me before
