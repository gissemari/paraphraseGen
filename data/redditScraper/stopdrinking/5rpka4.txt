Coming up on 200 days. I won't say it's not been difficult there's been several close calls and chances to relapse but I've held firm and have reached this point in my life. The thing I'm starting to notice is that my confidence is increasing day by day. Before I used alcohol to give me 'Dutch courage' or even just to mask my everyday social anxiety (I never realised that the booze could be prolonging the anxiety...!). But now I feel I have the ability to dive into situations that old me would have run away from...A friend of mine who stopped drinking in 1988 told me: 'you get more than you ever give up' and I'm starting to see it is true. Be strong folks. I won't drink with you today.

Congrats on 200 I won't drink with you today! ..
What a journey for you!! Great work and congrads on 200 can't wait to see your progress at the one year mark.  You are the man.
Congrats on 200 days! Had my badge reset and today is day 3. Was sober for 24 days prior to that. I think my triggers here meeting old friends and throwing myself into a party mood and the overconfidence of being able to quit anytime. NOT!! Had my worst hangover the second time I drank earlier this week. I'm done with this alcohol shit for life!!!
That is such good news to hear that confidence levels can continue to go up.  I'm sure we all remember the extreme doubt and discomfort that comes in the early days.
Nice! My confidence has never been this high. I'm walking taller and not slinking around hoping to go unnoticed. ..I love what your friend told you. I'm gonna remember that one! It's true! ..Keep up the hard work. I won't drink with you! 
awesome. congrats on 200!
That's great!  I find my confidence is slowly climbing as well.  Feels pretty damn good.  I will not drink with you today.
