Wooooooooot. To date I made it through Christmas New Years Valentine's Day St. Patrick's Day Easter and a family vacation to Paris without a single alcoholic beverage. I've lost 30 lbs (including that pesky wine bloat) earned back a whole bunch of trust from my family and have made a bunch of friends in the fellowship. ..Very cool. Life before wasn't really life- I spent the better part of my late 20s sedating because I didn't know how to be myself. I drank for freedom I drank for peace and I drank to feel. My strategy for those objectives was interesting considering how my days turned into waking up hungover going to work (only to do a mediocre job at anything) coming home and drinking 2 bottles of wine in isolation so I could drift off to sleep while watching another rerun of SVU. ..Sobriety has given me immense perspective but in all honesty I am bewildered at how I still think that I could probably "enjoy" a few glasses of wine. Wild. The only options I have are to stay honest get my ass to meetings and remember how lonely it was on the other side. I already tried it that way and it didn't work. ..I don't post often but I read your stories every day. Thank you for your struggles inspiration and hope. Here's to another day sober :)

Congratulations! It sounds like you are doing it right. That's a lovely 6!
Crazy how much power that tiny little 6 in your star has!  Right on!
6 is a great number! You are an inspiration to everyone here. Keep up the great work. 
This is a wonderful post and I found it to be very inspiring. I'm struggling with some urges to drink and this post reminded me about all of the good things in my life thanks to sobriety.
