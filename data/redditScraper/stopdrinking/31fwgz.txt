Last night I was watching The Sandlot and I had to turn it off cause it just made me sad. I longed to be a kid again and do it all over. I felt the weight of my poor choices and the urgency of my problem...Age 17 & 18 is when I started drinking/using and I have a lot of fond memories. But age 19-23 is a complete blur. 23-26 is less blurry and a time period I consider my AA days. First tried the program at 23 and got 6 3 & 4 months of sobriety over the years. I'm grateful for these years of growth but I'm blown away that I relapsed so much and kept going backwards...I'll be 27 in a couple of weeks and I don't want anymore of my 20's to be blurred. The last 27 days have been easy mode as far as sobriety goes. Day 1 was the only day that I struggled and had cravings. I haven't been to any meetings and don't plan to unless cravings return. Something has changed about me. I don't know what but I feel different...It sounds goofy but in 2013 I started losing my hair and I've been obsessed with aging and my wasted youth ever since. But I see a lot of potential on my way to age 30. I hope to find happiness again and stop living in the past.

You can look back on the past as wasted opportunities.  For me lamenting the past only led to more bad feelings.  More bad feelings always led me back to wanting a drink...I never really started to feel good about myself and my recovery until I learned to live in the moment and stop 1)regretting the past and 2)worrying about the future...Good luck and congrats on your time so far!
I'm glad I went to meetings prior to experiencing cravings because I developed a bit of a network (shaky but still there) that I could use for bad times. A new meeting full of complete strangers might not be as much help during a dark time as a meeting full of acquaintances or a phone number of a maybe soon-to-be friend. Doing as much as I could to protect myself while I still had the no-craving stamina was good insurance against wasting any more of my youth. Which I totally hear you on by the way. Being sober has done wonders for my aging woes as well (I am a couple years older than you). I just had a birthday and felt like my age went down instead of up for once. Wish you well!
