Hi everyone.  First of all thank you to everyone here and on the chat.  I've been able to pull through a couple of tough moments thanks to your help...I'm feeling pretty good after 10 days but I'm worried about keeping my motivation and getting complacent.  Reading stories of those who have relapsed after a long time of sobriety has me worried.  I thought I'd post my list here to help stay motivated and for feedback if anyone cares to comment...I stole some of this from this sub but am not sure who I stole it from...sorry for not being able to give credit where it's due...---..*to stop having hangovers which ruin the next day for me (tired hazy lethargic unmotivated)..*to enjoy a clear mind every day  ..*to start on a path to overall health and fitness (this shit will kill you)..*to save money..*to look better..*to "get out of second gear" (I'm half the person I could be -- time to change that)..*to at the very least get a sense of who I truly am emotionally (can't do that when I'm drunk)..

&gt; [B]ut I'm worried about keeping my motivation and getting complacent...AA meetings and having a path via the 12 Steps helped me get out of 2d gear.
Relapse stories should worry you.  They can happen to anyone of us.  ..For me stopping drinking was the first part of the equation.  I had to then learn how to live my life without the obsession/need for alcohol.  That part took serious work.  But when I did that work (and still do) the pay-off is amazing.  
I'd highly recommend AA for helping with motivation. It's the best!
