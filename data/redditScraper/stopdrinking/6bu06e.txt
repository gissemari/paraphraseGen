This past Superbowl I drank the last bottle of wine I may ever drink. I literally pat myself on the back every once and a while when I remember how far I've come because I didn't think this was possible. I purposely say "may" because I don't want to get lulled into a false sense of completion as if the beast is vanquished and there is nothing left to fear. I need to keep reminding myself that the beast is just weakened and locked in a cage; and the second I open that cage up convinced I tamed it it'll come roaring out stronger than ever...That's the biggest challenge for me now I think: reminding myself of why I did this in the first place and how important this is. I have moments where people around me are having a drink with dinner or going out and I think to myself "Just have a drink don't go crazy and keep it infrequent." I have to stop and remind myself that we tried that many many times and that I don't enjoy casual drinking. For me binge drinking IS drinking...Luckily the battles are easier to fight these days yet somehow more complex. I remember when I was so stuck in my habits that I quit even trying to make excuses for my drinking altogether accepted the fact that it was killing me and basically just said fuck it. Through luck and the support of people around me I am not that guy anymore. I don't have strong cravings for alcohol anymore. That initial skirmish done. But the societal pressures to quaff poison doesn't go away. ..That's my battle now and I think that's the reason I felt it was important for me to come here at this milestone and reaffirm my commitment to sobriety. I've succeeded in keeping alcohol out of my own body but I can't keep it out of society. I worry sometimes that my relapse will start in the most casual way ever a night where I say "Fuck it I got this" and have a drink with the game oblivious as my defenses break down and I end up back where I started. But I did not drink with you today and for that reason I have hope. Thanks for reading..

Good Job on triple digits!!  I find that coming here often and reading posts helps me to stay vigilant.  It's infuriating how those thoughts can come back to the surface tempting me to try moderation.  Thanks for sharing!  I will not drink with you today.  
100 days is a huge milestone.  Much healing has taken place.  Congrats.  I took my last drink a while ago.  Was it my last drink ever?  God knows.  I am grateful that just for today I have a reprieve from my disease.  I don't let my mind fiddle with the possibility of a relapse because my thoughts can become my actions.
