Somewhere in the back of my mind I kept thinking that someday eventually I would be able to moderate. If I quit long enough I could return to drinking and be able to do so like a "normal person". After a couple recent slip ups (relapses...) I realize that I won't ever be a normal drinker. One is never just one and will never be just one. It's a hard realization because I hang out with a lot of drinkers and a lot of things I really enjoy involve drinking. (Sports games bachelor watching parties happy hours a beer at the finish line of a race...). So it gives me anxiety to think about those things not involving alcohol. I absolutely know it's the right choice for me to stop completely and for good but it also feels scary...Any insight and/or encouragement related to this most welcome.

I know that I can't moderate. One *sip* is all it takes to land me right back in the hospital or worse... Here's a link I found helpful:http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3xckfo/how_did_you_get_through_the_first_few_days/...Keep comin' back I'd love to hear your progress! 
One of the things that helped me was to really have a mentality shift around the concept of moderation.  Rather than think of it as an "ability" or a "power" that "normal" people have and I don't I came to see it for what it truly is: the ability to moderate is not a good thing or something to aspire to. It is a terrible weak and negative thing because it gives you the license or OK to go on pouring small amounts of poison in your body regularly which while each dose may be small (one drink or two drinks) over a life time is still a crap ton of alcohol which we know is poisonous to the human body/mind/spirit/soul in ANY amount no matter how small or large. ..So I have come to the see moderation as a weakness and that there is nothing even remotely "normal" about people that can/want to moderate.  Same as if you came up to me right now and said you'd like to go siphon gas out of your car gas tank and drink it in moderation I'd tell you that's not normal or something to want to aspire to.
For decades moderation has been an elusive goal that seems to always dart around the next corner just as I am about to get within arm's length of it. Yet I continue the chase.
My therapist is actually pushing for me to moderate  . I suspect it's because  forever  freaks some people out which is true but man... he's clearly not an alcoholic. ..Anyway whatever works for you! This sub has all sorts. But I definitely can't moderate. I always finish the bottle because obviously it's going to turn into vinegar overnight if I don't. Awesome logic.
