Hey guys!! Hey guys!! Happy Wednesday! [The signal is on the horizon!](http://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/54896498.jpg)..Let's hump it out on this happy day! Hump days are when we calibrate our sobriety check in see how our /sd buds are doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations in the format below...**Triumph**: I spent some time recently going back and reading through some of my earlier posts from when I was still frequently resetting my badge and from the first month or two I was sober (this time around). I remember how much I thought about drinking and how it felt like balancing on a beam that was sometimes a foot wide and sometimes a few inches wide. My beam feels more like a floor now. I'm not constantly in a state of high alert and anxiety about alcohol. My mind has been freed to think about the future in ways that are totally new to me and it's great. I'm going to spend this week reflecting on the huge feeling of relief that brings. ..**Struggle**: At first sober time felt like super extended time. Days were so long; weeks were endless. Now time is passing so quickly! I know it's because my life is full of friends and events and hope and activities but it's still a bit alarming. Those early days weeks and months of sobriety were so hard but there's a part of me that misses how much more slowly time seemed to pass back then. ..**General Chat**: As you've progressed in your sobriety or if you're just starting out how have you changed how you tell people you don't drink? As I get more confident with who I am and how I present myself I'm more comfortable sharing the fact that I don't drink because I used to drink too much. It feels like a teeny opportunity for education especially with some of the younger people at work who look up to me as a "cool" boss at the same time they're missing meetings because they're hungover. It's an interesting dynamic. ..More important how are you guys doing? How has this week been for you? Let us know your triumphs and struggles!
----------immediate responses--------

**Triumph**: Tons of stress.  Things aren't smooth sailing at the moment in any part of my life.  But I feel like I'm handling things well.  I'm just trying to keep an even temperament and not let any one thing bother me too much...**Struggle**: See above...**General Chat**: How I deal with telling people I don't drink is situational.  There are times the situation only calls for a "No thanks".  Sometimes the audience only calls for a "No thanks".  As I've gotten more sober time under me though the people in my life that I feel like being open with get something along the lines of "I used to drink way too much".  Occasionally I throw in a "Once I started I couldn't stop".  People seem to understand those things.  If they were Faceyspace friends they remember that 90% of my posts had something to do with alcohol too.
Triumph: Have finally come to a place of peace regarding my roommate who I'm pretty sure has relapsed on meth (or if she hasn't she's certainly acting like it). Her 'up' days she drives me crazy with her nonstop chaos and the rest of the time she just sleeps and eats. The drama was driving me nuts but when I accepted that whether using or not she is a sick person has helped me come to a place of acceptance tolerance and trying to be a good example by continuing to live serenely and work my own program instead of being irritated and resentful at her for dumping drama on me all the time. (I am hoping to save up enough $ to move out in the next few months. I don't want to enable her but she will just tell me to eff off if I question her behavior)....Struggle: See above....Chat: I feel the same way about sharing that I don't drink. Pretty much all my close friends and family know and I feel a lot more ok/comfortable sharing that with new people.

**Triumph**I've managed for the first time in weeks to really say "no" to my eating disorder. I think my not-drinking is the cause why I was able to do that. And this week has been easier than the last one and I've stayed away from NA beer too - I have a lot of cravings but not all the time like last week....**Struggle** I've found that I still lack some motivation. I try to find it because I can't be on Antabus for the rest of my life. And I still haven't found enough ways to deal with boredom and anxiety - now that I have a flu and can't exercise I'm at loss what to do with all these emotions. ...**General Chat**I have been sober for such a short while that I don't know yet what I will tell people. I think that I won't tell them the real reason behind my sobriety and perhaps I won't even bring it up if it isn't necessary.
**Triumph:** Life is pretty good right now. I was taking inventory of all the things I have going on and it made me happy that I have so many positive people and things in my life. ..**Struggle:** My uncle was diagnosed with colon cancer recently and my dad's doctor told him that I should go get a colonoscopy which kind of scares me. Sorry if this is an over-share...**General Chat:** Like /u/JimBeamsHusband it's situational for me. I'm less ashamed than I used to be about telling people I used to drink too much however I'm still selective about who I share that with. Sometimes it's as simple as no thanks. Other times I tell people I stopped for health reasons and leave it at that. 
**Triumph** - I am on top of the skin picking. My skin's had a bad reaction to some topicals I've been prescribed and the only thing I must do right now is leave it alone so it's a good thing I've managed to gain some control before this happened!..**Struggle** - avoiding my assignment. ..**General chat** - I changed from "*I'm not drinking for a while*" with no good answer to why or how long for to "*I don't drink anymore*" or "*I don't drink*." If you're an acquaintaince I'll probably focus on the benefits of sobriety; if you're in my bubble or a redditor you can have warts and all if you've got the time :)
**Triumph:** I've maintained a veneer of serenity and calm through some stressful and tumultuous times. I haven't made it but I'm faking pretty well...**Struggle:** I was struggling last week. Then I reflected on a year ago and how **much** better things are now. Sure there are still struggles challenges and life can be shit. But now I can deal with it in ways that I could not yet last year...**Chat:** I try not to make a big deal about it. I haven't put myself in situations where excessive drinking would be acceptable so no one really notices that I'm sucking back seltzer instead of beer.
**Triumph:** More and more I'm amazed by how happy I feel.  I haven't felt this clear headed and excited about life in years.  I enjoy the weather more food more people more and even when I hate my jobs I still kind of enjoy getting up and going to them.  Oh. And I got two kittens...**Struggle:** Even with increased happiness my motivation is low.  I got busy and now that I'm not I haven' gotten back to running.  I'm lazy and I don't want to.  I'm not feeling depressed but it's my day off it's noon and aside from making breakfast and taking care of my tiny zoo I haven't gotten out of bed.  I constantly think of stories or poems but they never get written.  How do people teach themselves self discipline?  Because waiting for the motivation to kick in is not working.  Oh. And I think I have a UTI...**General Chat:** My favorite way to turn down alcohol if someone happens to ask why I don't drink is to tell them it stopped being fun.  And that's true.  What's great is that so many people agree!  Even as they are drinking they get this look of realization that they haven't been enjoying it as much as they thought and often they are just engaging in ritual or habit.
Triumph: 31 days today. I guess that's a full month sober no matter how you cut it. Now to get to 2...Struggle: Intense anxiety is still overwhelming my every attempt to call my family...General Chit-Chat: Nobody ever says that things are "cinchy" anymore. People used to say that simple things were "a cinch" but now they don't...As for how I tell people I stooped drinking I just say I'm a bad alcoholic. I don't give a shit anymore. I'm no longer ashamed of how far I've fallen. I'm just proud of myself for still being alive.
**Triumph:** I got offered a job by another enterprise networking company today due to my troubleshooting skills attention to detail and the pride I take in my work. The customer called me the best ***insert major ISP here*** technician he's ever had the pleasure of dealing with...**Struggle:** I've been stressing out over a test I'm taking tomorrow and it's been tough to manage without alcohol. I'm doing it though... stopped counting the days...**General Chat:** I'm blunt about it. I tell the truth. Honesty is best. Once people know how you've been subdued by the troubles of alcoholism and the way you used to hurt yourself they understand you're better off.
**Triumph**: I spend less money that I can't afford to waste. Alcohol was a pain on my pocketbook because I made it my lifestyle. I hesitate to go through my bank statements to get the real picture but once I find out how much money I'll be saving by not drinking it will be a mixture of shame and relief I'm sure. No lie I'm proud of my 7 days sober......**Struggle:** but it's only been a week without being without the juice and although I feel refreshed and awake a part of me still very much desires to get sloshed. Every day. I'm thankful for not having any apparent health issues after having an on-again-off-again 30-70 unit per week habit for a few years. Now I have to actively deal with normal adult stuff that make me really anxious that I have been avoiding through that time and facing the music is killing my sleep. Peter Pan is me....**General Chat:** So I was hanging with friends last night at a bar where I used to work. My excuse was that I'm on medication that doesn't react well with alcohol. Not true although I have admitted before on previous attempts of sobriety that I was taking a break from alcohol. My friends aren't the type to pressure or pry so it was all good. Eventually I'll come clean and I'm sure they'll understand. Those that don't don't need my presence for a good time. :)
Got my star and a red chip today. Feeling great! And not drinking of course. Stay sober friends! 
Triumph: I've noticed being a lot more happy lately...Struggle: Work idiots who should clearly see my superiority but refuse to acknowledge it...General Chat: my wife and I had an old friend over to dinner.  Someone who I used to drink with (although she's not a big drinker).  She seemed somewhat hurt when I told her I was an alcoholic.  She felt bad that she didn't know or notice.  It was kind of awkward but also kind of touching.
Triumph :  I'm gaining some patience back. Days with my little kids are better. Less shame at the end of the day. Looking forward to being a good fun mom...Struggle:  I'm excited and nervous about an assessment with a county drug and alcohol counselor. We've talked on the phone and she sounds nice but I'm not looking forward to talking about my problems. I'm ready for some tools though. .Drinking is my stress reliever so I've been trying to avoid over filing  my plate. Which means avoiding my mil so she's not too  happy with me.  .Also moving into my parents place soon  and they don't know about any of this. I don't want to tell them but I plan on going to aa up there so not sure how that will all work  out. ..Chat:  I haven't told any friends I'm not drinking yet haven't been to any social functions yet. At this point I don't think I'm ready. I've never not had a drink when I'm with my friends so they would definitely  notice.
I'm just about at a week. Man it's been the longest week of my life. I'm finally sleeping through the night as of yesterday. I slept like a baby and didn't wake up obscenely early. I've been going to meetings and getting a lot of numbers. Now to find a sponsor. ..Only downside is I've seemed to replace wine with cheeseburgers. I'm turning into Randy from TPB.
I only have 22 minutes left to write this! ..**Triumph:** They call me slim shady I'm back I'm back. But really. I feel good. Finishing off my day 6 sober. Feeling really good about this attempt. I'm not hungover anymore and still dedicated to this! Planning on sticking around :)..**Struggle:** My work schedule is 1:00pm - 9:00pm. Those hours started 4.5 months ago and I'm still not used to it. I know the fact I relapsed like 4 months ago is a contributing factor. Working until 9:00pm falling asleep at 4:00am and waking up at 12:30pm to go to work for 1:00pm is not a good set up. Staying sober and fixing that is my main focus right now. ..**Chat** - The Mindy Project is funny. Thats all haha
**TRIUMPH** Wednesday was freaking fantastic.  I woke up with chills at 3 am I cannot explain not like withdrawls cold sweats or walking into an air conditioned room after getting out of the pool.  Like I was frozen to the bone and my both my feet ached like gnarly plantar fascinates.  After a few minutes in a hot hot shower it dawned on me how freakin awesome it is to have a good supply of clean hot water.  After another 45 minutes on the shower floor I'd melted enough to drag myself back to my bed with clean sheets and drifted back to sleep.  Daughters alarm clock didn't go off so she  overslept and missed the bus but somehow I woke with just enough time to rouse her press a cup of coffee and make it to school before the tardy bell rang and put another ding in my latent parental guilt back-monkey. We had an awesome conversation in the car on the way to school (she's 10).   Played my guitar with focus for a few hours and worked in the yard intermittently between dips in the pool.  Lunch with the kid at school dinner with family and friends. Started a new daily evening time devotional and made it  to bed in time for a little adult unwinding with the baby mama.  Fantastic day and all I had to do was keep my gratitude greater than my expectations and not pickup.   I couldn't have had this day a few years ago.  I'd  have been hungover wrapped up in self pity and anger and made sure to I had to "deal with"s day less pleasant because it used to piss me off to be around other seemingly happy people because whatever they had I'd been "un-faired" out of by the mean old universe.    I continue to peel the onion of sobriety and life.   I am pretty sure I've reached a stage often described with a cliche which until recently I was sure was total bullshit "I wouldn't trade my best day drunk for my worst day sober"  (now - not at first).   The only thing I did was make a decision to get out of the drivers seat and follow through with it (most days).  The rest is a serendipitous series of graceful non-coincidences that I only need  to be clear headed enough to observe and learn from.  Love all you guys.  Cheers!
