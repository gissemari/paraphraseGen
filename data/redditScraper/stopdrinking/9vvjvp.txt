It's the only thing I haven't committed to yet. I've been to detox numerous times only to get out and relapse the same day because I go right back to the same situations. My question is - how do you deal with all of you real life stuff after neglecting it for so long while you go and try to get help? My car payments are past due My license plate is about to expire in 2 days. My rent is past due and I'm supposed to have a court date at some point at the end of this month to take out my annuity early to help with my financial situation but it hasn't been scheduled yet. I haven't worked in 2 months after losing my job because drinking. I have about $200 in my bank account. I also know when I get out of rehab I need to go to sober living because my roommate drinks a lot and so do all of my friends in the building. They don't understand alcoholism. I feel like I am going to need a complete change in order to stay sober this time around and I want to set myself up for success but not sure how to get there with all of this stuff looming over me. Do I just not worry about it and go get help? I have no insurance so I am looking at free rehabs via my therapists recommendations and I've got to call some places today and then go check myself into detox. I'm just at my bottom and I don't know where to go from here but I'm willing to do whatever it takes.
