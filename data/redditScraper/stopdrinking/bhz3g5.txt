...and relapsing isn't an option but they don't feel as good as they're going to and the brain and body are still making their repairs but we feel like we need to keep doing things but life feels dull and empty and it's beginning to feel like this is what the rest of my life is going to be like and I just want to curl up into the fetal position and hide from the entire world.    136 days alcohol-free 18 days nicotine-free

Congratulations on your sober progress.  That's awesome!..You are missing the bright spot and I understand...You have **Quit** your addictions.  You're sober today and you're nicotine free today.  That is the Goal TODAY!..You have success in those goals!..When I kept doing that I reached that miracle of "I no longer think about drinking have cravings and do not **want** to drink!"..There are ups and downs in my sober life.  Biorhythms is you like that term.  ..However my mind will lie to me:  "feel like this what the rest of my life is going to be like"....  ..That's a lie on two levels.  First I recognize my mind is lying to me.  It's also lying about "feeling" as that's not something I feel instead it is something I THINK.  Secondly I have no idea what the rest of my life is going to be like.  All I have is today...I am NOT the voice in my head.  I'm the person who hears the voice in my head.  When that voice lies to me I literally say - "You're lying to me.  I will not heed what you're telling me.  You are encouraging harmful choices.  I am walking away from your lies."   Then I choose something else...Keep making progress!
