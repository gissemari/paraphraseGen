I won't make excuses. But I have been weak in my decision not to drink. As I'm sure many of us have done time and time again I have fallen back into my old habits. ..I went almost 3 months without a drop of alcohol. But I fell right into my old habits of drinking every night. As I type this I'll admit I had a few. But every time I drink even if it is with a coworker after a hard day I feel like I am letting myself down. ..My SO knows about my problem. And even that this sub helped me in the past. But she doesn't know that I have fallen back into my old habits. She almost never drinks and we do not live together. So it has been that much easier to hide it from her. ..I won't place the burden of responsibility on you guys like I have done in the past. For those of you who read this far thank you. At this moment I just need somewhere to vent. I know what I need to do. And I know how I felt when I was stronger willed. But getting to that point again has been a struggle for me. ..Thank you for reading. For those of you struggling with drinking don't let my weakness discourage you. Addiction is a disease. Talking to others is the best way to fight that. Be honest with both yourself and with people who care. ..

Vent away. Glad you're back and taking it day by day. IWNDWYT. 
Hey I've been there. Turns out those "weaknesses". Have become my strength . You can do it !!!! I won't drink with you today 
You've gone 3 months without it so you know you're capable to do it again. Welcome back &lt;3
You're not the only one going through this I'm in a similar situation. One day at a time is all we can do.
