TL;DR I'm ready to admit defeat and badge up and I owe it all to you guys. ..After finding this subreddit a couple weeks ago its been your stories of success and failure  that have helped me easily say no when offered alcohol. My relapse came when I didn't read r/stopdrinking for a few days. I didn't ask for a badge right away because I wasn't sure I was ready and pretty much knew I'd fail at it...but I'm ready now and I want to thank each and every one of you for giving me the courage to say so!!..I know this isn't really TL;DR but I had typed out about 4 different really long posts (all from my phone) before the last one accidentally got erased and I just decided fuck it I'm going with the TL;DR just so I can get this out there...Thank you all and if you're ever doubting your worth know it was your words that pushed this stranger to make a positve change!..Requesting badge now.

Welcome. This subreddit is a positive force which I respect immensely...Have you thought about AA? Meeting with real people who understand is a powerful experience and helped me think twice when I wanted to drink. 
Glad to have you! My advise is to badge up read and post! !
Smart move. That badge can be really helpful along with other knowledge and experience shared here. 
Welcome aboard KOOPA425 nice to meet you! It's the hardest and best thing. Ever. There's some wise* and generous souls that post here. ..
