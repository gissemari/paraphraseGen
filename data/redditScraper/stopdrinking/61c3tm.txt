Hi all! I was lurking every day six months ago. I think this site is the only thing that kept me going. It felt good not to drink but I felt hopeless for three months solid. Then it got better and I came here less and less. I never did get a badge until today. This past week I had some serious thoughts about drinking it just sounded good you know just one drink would be nice. I am so thankful I came on here last night. The first post I read was someone relapsing after 3 and 1/2 years and it took a month to get back. It was the story I needed to hear. I've strung time together before and then think I can handle alcohol. I can't. I need to stay sober I want to stay sober. Thanks for being here..

Welcome!  Looks like we're close in SD days.  Glad you came here.  It helps when thoughts about drinking surface.  I will not drink with you today.  
Good for you staying strong and sticking with your goals.
