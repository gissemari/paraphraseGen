I'm in nursing school. I got absolutely black out wasted the night before clinicals that I needed to be at by 6am. I missed it. I was only going to have a couple of drinks but that never happens. .I had to talk to the director of nursing and beg not to be held back. I've gotten pretty good at being humble and coming up with good excuses for work but missing clinicals can cause a major setback. I was able to fix it. Phew. .The drive home I wanted to get alcohol so bad. It's the weekend I'm relaxed now. Everything is fine. I struggled so hard resisting going to the store. .I didn't buy anything I stayed home and it's been a struggle off and on all night but I made it. Alcohol didn't win tonight. .Thanks for listening

First glad you're here. I'm an aspiring nurse too :) it's definitely not the least stressful of career paths but remember why you're in it. I'm glad you came out okay with your director but I'm sure you don't want to throw it all away because of alcohol. I won't drink with you. 
I found meetings created a resource network for me when the urges struck.
Good work on getting through the night. I know how hard it can be. I've learnt that more alcohol fixes nothing ever!
Yay Kitten!!!!! .I made it through dinner (at a restaurant where they make a great version of my favorite drink) a stop at the liquor store (for wine for hubby. I don't drink wine) and stop at a convenience store where they have lots of beer to chose from... I struggled alongside you. I was so happy to wake up without a hangover today. I'll not drink with you today again!
