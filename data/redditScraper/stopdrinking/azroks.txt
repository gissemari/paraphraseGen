This last Friday I went way overboard drinking downtown. It was a perfect storm of finally seeing old friends and enough big positive news in my life to celebrate. What started as a great time didn't take too long for me to get off the rails. I made a huge fool of myself dancing and flirting with other girls even though I'm engaged. The truth is though what I intended as "flirting" was basically different girls casually dismissing my drunk ass. Thank goodness I didn't have any luck as it would have traumatized me usually I'm totally committed to my fiance but I just had no inhibitions at all...Fast forward through the weekend and I kept drinking alone at my apartment to dull the anxiety of the night before. Saturday just came and went in a haze of nausea and crippling anxiety. Finally Sunday comes and I start clearing my head. I streamed my church service and helped calm down my concerned friends and family it finally got easier to look at my phone again. I'm taking things one hour at a time and things are looking better I still have no appetite and I'm just generally nervous. I get my ass out the door for a haircut and sure enough my car doesn't start afterward. So there I am having this weekend that drove a lot of my closest friends away and I'm stuck feeling helpless in a parking lot. Luckily it was a quiet Sunday in the area so I was able to get an employee to help me get jumped. I couldn't help but think this was karma kicking my ass for my actions earlier in the weekend...At this point my head is much clearer I end up calling my mom and my fiance and crying to them. Sure enough my mom informed me that my aunt had been taken to a detox/psych ward over the weekend after a binge of her own. This really struck a chord with me for someone else in my own family having the same struggle as me at the same time. Karma is trying to tell me something and I believe it's that now needs to be the time I fully commit. Thanks for reading friends.

Glad you're here!..Sorry to hear about your aunt and glad it's not you!..Looking forward to hearing more about your journey.
Karma? Sounds like Newton's third law!..I jest but I wouldn't try to explain issues in your life caused by alcohol by karma. Aside from a random need for a jump it sounds like the rest of your weekend played out as designed - drinking then mistakes then shame. ..What I personally see as karma/positive energy in the universe is all the shakes that go your way when you pursue sobriety. Here's a few examples of random (you be the judge) good stuff that's happened to me:..Excellent performance review.Finishing significant house projects (ahead of schedule less drunk rework).Kids telling me they love me.My wife smiling at me .Home life calming down.Weight loss.Financials improved.And a hundred other things already.. There's a clear common link to all of those but I don't *control* any of them. There's one easy action I can ID that makes my own luck: sobriety...It's not a panacea and bad days just plain exist but I think you'll find that you get what you give (or give up) when it comes to working and remaining sober. .
