I am an addict. I recently told many close friends about my struggles with alcohol and my intention to be sober. Yet here I am sad and drinking agaln trying to escape my current reality. I know I am capable of being sober but I'm just struggling to follow through. So much shame yet I still have so much hope. I need support but I also feel I need this one more day with booze. I know it's up to me to stop this insanity but how do I get there?

As outlined in the community guidelines we ask that you only post when you have not been drinking. For this reason we had to remove your post. But we'll be here tomorrow if you want to come back then.
Hey it's always hard to stop anything you've been doing for so long. A lot of people never stop drinking on the first second third (etc) try. Just keep your head up you don't have anything to be ashamed of you'll get to where you wanna be
