I don't know if it's because I'm back in my daily grind routine this Monday or it's a Day 5 thing or what but I am struggling HARD.  I don't even know if I want to drink but I sure want to smoke and I only smoke when I drink.  I mean I am itching.  There is no way that I am going to drink or smoke but the knuckles are full-on white.  ..&amp;#x200B;..My weekend was pretty great - no real cravings good restful sleep.  Not sure if this is my guard somewhat let down and cravings steamrollering in or if this is the cigs giving me one last stand or something else.  I am just all of a sudden crawling out of my skin.  So I guess I need to flip the script.  ...I am going to wash my face get some water and do some hobby shit until bed.  I am grateful that I don't drink or smoke for the following reasons:..1). I can drive anywhere I want whenever I want..2). I will be well rested tomorrow morning when I get up bright and early to catch a plane..3). I will not race off of the plane to smoke ..4). I will not need to duck out of meetings every few hours to smoke..5). I will not spend $20+ per drink at the airport waiting for my plane..6). I will not be dehydrated on the plane...7). I will be fine to drive home from the airport when I get back..8). I will fall asleep and get good rest after a long day of travel..&amp;#x200B;..I think it passed.  That was amazingly intense.  Like a freight train.  Thanks for reading.  IWNDWYT.

Day 5 and day 19 were by far my hardest days. Hang in there!  You can do it.
I quit smoking and drinking at the same time. Taking Chantix for the smoking. Most times I have no idea if it is a craving for a drink or a smoke that is doing my head in or the damn side effects of the medication. It's all fun and games...Keep up the good work.
