*For the last few days I've been gripped by the fear of relapse. Strong urges to drink have surged like tidal waves across my life wether whilst happy and relaxed or whilst stressed and bored. It hasn't seemed to matter my mood or my surroundings. It's felt inevitable. Unstoppable craving like a fucking frieght train heading towards me. Ive been staring at my hands and at my eyes in the mirror. Neither one has been showing the shakes I feel under my skin. I said to a colleague that "I feel like a bottle of whiskey and a cop to punch". I said to a housemate that "I feel like a bottle of wine and a slowly chilling bathtub". I said to a friend that "I feel like a dive bar full of strangers followed by a long stumble home in the rain". That power rushes towards me seemingly unstoppable.   .. I could have drunk but I wrote the following instead. In writing it I guess I realized that it didn't matter the size speed and power of that desire to drink. I could never get rid of it. But I don't have to go with it. Anyway:*.  ...You can hear the train coming. You squeeze your your eyes shut praying for it to stop. There's a vibration in your bones and a tingling on your skin. Your stomach twists. Your fingertips slip in the grips they've made in fists. It's getting foggy and your mind creaks as the train draws nearer. All the warning signs all the emotions. You know what will happen when that train arrives.   ..When you get on that old ride you'll smile as you sit. There will be a few quiet cheers but mostly a sense of sweeping relief. It is a lovely feeling when the train is slipping away slowly gathering speed. At least until it's shaking and rattling deafening and nauseating. You swear it gets worse each ride. The train gets rustier but somehow faster every time. A quiet prayer ensures you won't derail this time. Not that you believe in a higher power but this prayer is a ritual now. You'll end up at least one stop maybe a few away from the road you want to be on but you can't stop that train from coming. Now you can hear its rumble and its rattle and its beacon is flickering through the trees as it comes closer. All you have to do is leave the platform but you work here you've lived here for years. You've spent my life riding trains. As the light and the rumble get closer you're frozen like a squirrel on the open road unable to pull yourself away as that train pulls closer.  ...This platform is rotting and you're fighting just to stand still let alone drop that ticket and walk off. What are you going to do when this train arrives? Or the next one? The thought is consuming. You just want to ride that train and look out the window watch the world go by. Driving takes effort and knowledge of your destination and walking is tiring.   ..You know where that train goes. Are you going to take it another stop? Where does that train take you if you keep riding it?   ..You look down at your feet then up the track. The train is getting close now. What are you going to do? Will you skip this train? Where do you really want to go?
