I was not looking forward to this moment. I've been awake for some hours now and I just now remembered the dream I woke up from. I was drinking copiously at a dance party with all my friends. I tasted it. I felt the carbonation hit the back of my throat. All my senses were involved. God damnit. ..I still have little desire to drink but that was such an unnecessary reminder from my subconscious. ..Eversince I quit drinking my dreams have been very intense and visual and vivid. Never lucid. I dream I'm reunited with my ex in her bed and wake up on a cold floor. I dream about all the traumatic experiences I'm still unpacking from the chaotic past 3 years. I missed dreams. I missed nightmares. I missed having a wild imagination writing music and poems for days. It's all coming back in full force. I'm winning the battle for my mind.

I'm right there with you with the extremely intense/vivid dreams but never had the drinking dreams for some reason...I imagine they must suck but still they are just thoughts (involuntary even) so we have no obligation to act on them. They're a normal part of the healing process :-) Let's not drink today!
I have relapse dreams still too. In a way I like them because I wake up feeling horribly guilty but then an equivalent or greater sense of relief and happiness overwhelms me when I realize that it was *just a dream*. Also I had the super amazingly vivid dreams the first week or so. Those fade somewhat at least for me but I still have more REM sleep than I ever got while binging. 
You were at a party!? My using dreams are boring: Me standing in my kitchen florescent light above pop open beer down it reach in fridge and grab another over and over in silence. They're so lame. 
This is great to hear. I've missed dreams too and don't create anywhere near as much as I used to.  Hope your comments pan out for me! On day 4 dry. 
Oh man the drinking dreams are so super intense! I have them every once in a while.
I have relapse dreams from time to time.  Personally I like them.  In the dreams I usually take a drink and then suddenly realize that I don't drink anymore!  In more than one dream I've wondered (in an alarmed way) about resetting my badge here and what I'm going to write on /r/stopdrinking about that drink.  And then I usually wake up and the relief is so real and I'm thrilled that I didn't actually drink.
Luckily don't have them.
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2dit1m/what_do_drinking_dreams_mean/) is a write up that /u/coolcrosby which is full of some good info regarding dreams. I just view them as a relatively painless reminder that I DON'T WANT TO DRINK!!
