I had 90+ days of sobriety last year while working on some classes at night and trying to fix my trygliceride levels with my doctor.  Around the holidays and after the class I decided to start drinking again slowly.  I was bummed to lose the progress I had made with losing weight and having to reset my badge.  ..I have been better about moderation since that 90 day stint and found I don't crave drinks as much as I used to especially if I give myself stuff to keep busy.  ..For anyone who relapsed or had to reset thier badge I want to offer inspiration.   It gets easier after the second week and it's even easier the second time you quit.  ..Tonight I'll celebrate my 3rd anniversary with my partner and later this month start a class and back to the gym to see how ripped I can get for summer.  But hopefully this helps for anyone on thier second third or xth try.  ..It gets easier and it's OK to start again.    Thanks to everyone out here and IWNDWYT ..

Thank you for this post. I'm trying not to think beyond one day at a time but posts like this about how your brain can change after periods of sobriety are SO encouraging.
