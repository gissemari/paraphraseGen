I'm sorry to be so negative but I've never felt this depressed and utterly hopeless in my entire life.....I've been working full time while making less money than my basic bills since August. In December I got a new job sales where I was promised I'd be making a lot more money than I actually am. I'm only making 12.50 an hour (I have a 4 year degree and finance and insurance certifications on top of it) and even working full time that's not enough money in a month to even cover just my rent car and car insurance (I live in NY) and every single day I'm more in debt than the day before and it's only a matter of time before I max out my credit cards :(..I've been looking for a new job since my third day here and things have been so far and few between. I had 3 interviews with a company in my field and it seemed like a dream job...amazing benefits even a pension good hours and enough money to pay my basic bills and even a little left over to go to a yoga class with a friend or get a coffee out every once in awhile something I haven't been able to do since August. And it was a job I knew I'd be good at and would actually enjoy :(..I found out today I didn't get the job and I feel so hopeless. I've been looking and applying for months now and it seems like nothing is happening...On top of this my boyfriend got a promotion at work! I am so proud of him but it's also hard to be excited for him making more than double what I make now and knowing that he lives very comfortably and has never struggled with money in his entire life selfish I know. Earlier this week he said he and his coworkers were going out tonight to celebrate and they wanted to meet me and I agreed...but now I do not want to go at all. I don't want to celebrate something I wish I had myself and have been trying to tirelessly to achieve while being around a bunch of drunk strangers. ..I haven't socialized much at all since getting sober besides AA but honestly I feel like I've lost my interest in people or at least in the winter when every single social event revolves around alcohol :/..I feel so lost and depressed right now

Have you thought about learning to code?..There's good money in it and the work is everywhere...&amp;#x200B;
