Hi all..I'm having a weird time over the last few days. I told one of my non-alchy friends that I was in a recovery program this weekend. It went really well and I'm glad I did but it was stressful and VERY exposing. One of her questions was "why did it get that bad" after we had been talking for awhile. I honestly didn't have an answer for her. In my recovery circle the answer is really "because I'm an alcoholic" and that's sufficient but that doesn't make sense to someone outside of this issue. ..I was thrown for a loop on this one. At the meeting I went to tonight someone explained a very clear root of her drinking and the person after her said that he had no reason - he always just felt weird. I think I'm with the latter dude but at the same time I know I'm displaying some weird behaviours like dissociating and numbing out (sober) all the time. I've been off for a couple of days. I don't aim to blame anyone for my alcoholism: in fact I feel a lot of guilt for being as messed up as I am with the really rad support system I have around me in family and friends. I just don't use their support like I should and feel compelled to hide my stuff although this is slowly changing...Anyways I'm not doing too hot. I got home 15 minutes ago from a meeting that ended two hours ago because I got roped into conversations with people that I didn't want to have and ended up agreeing to make sure someone got home although just as we were getting on the bus she said she would have been fine on her own. I know I needed some time away from myself but my gut still resents that I was made that much later by this lady who wanted to talk about Sandra Bullock movies. I'm a grump and I'm sorry but I don't feel right venting about this elsewhere. ..TL;DR: I'm mad at being a drunk without having a reason for it and two consecutive 1 hr meetings subsumed 5 hours out of my day which is where I'm choosing to channel my grumpiness.

I like efficiency and have always been one who believed I could distill just about any day-long seminar into less than 1 hour's worth of brass tacks. But sometimes slower *is* faster (yes that's strange). I try to see it as an investment that pays a great return. ..I just finished a meeting myself that had an unusually high amount of bloviating and went over time. It's not my favorite part of sobriety but I can tolerate it far better than I used to. Sometimes people just need other people to listen to them get stuff out of their head. Sometimes it's an exercise in patience or service. I'm a pretty good listener and anyway it still somehow helps keep me sober. ..And now for a few [sober jokes](http://www.cleanandsobernotdead.com/Humor/Humor.html)...:)
