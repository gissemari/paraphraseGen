The last couple of days have been a struggle.  I'm hanging in there but *only* because my husband would be extremely disappointed in me. I find myself getting angry about that too.  I am back to thinking about ways I can buy/drink without him knowing.  You know if he doesn't know... he can't be disappointed. ..Grr I hate this.  I hate being back to the hour by hour struggle.

I can tell you they will know.  I thought I was hiding my bottles for years under the bed in the work shop had one in each vehicle garden shed etc.  I always made sure I had one where I was.  I was not hiding anything.  She knew all along but knew I had to make the decision for myself before anything would happen.  I stopped for a week waiting for something to click.  It did not.  After 2 weeks that is when it clicked.  You said you were on an hour by hour struggle.  When I first quit I took it 10 minutes at a time then thought about it rinse and repeat.  10 minutes have gotten me to 3 weeks.  It does get easier I promise.  I do not know what will happen after the next 10 minutes but for those minutes I will not drink with you. -O
What else are you doing just for yourself? Maybe you suffer from low self esteem like me. It helps for me to just do small things for myself like cook a meal. Or a hobby or learn something new. ..Acceptance of self is huge for me too albeit I still struggle with it. But just thinking of the past as the past. It doesn't do anybody good by fixating on something that can't be changed...Have you looked into mindfulness or meditation?
Aw sorry you're struggling :/ I agree with the other post that maybe you should spoil yourself in other ways maybe that'll help make things a little less difficult right now. I still feel guilty doing that even though logically I know it's 100x better than drinking. Make yourself some brownies or nachos or buy yourself a beautiful new something? Some soft bath towels? We are all here for you though whenever ya need &lt;3
Feeling resentful about meeting other's expectations especially someone you love so much and who should just **accept** you is frustrating for sure. What would it be like for you to tell him you need some reassurance some acceptance? That you're feeling a little weak and vulnerable and you love him so much that it terrifies you you will disappoint him?
