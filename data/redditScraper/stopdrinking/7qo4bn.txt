I have been well over the past several days but the anxiety is clawing back in. Work is about to get complicated again with another staffing shortage I have to resolve in a hurry. ..While I have been mostly good the past few days I have had some pretty hard alcohol cravings. In my past attempts at sobriety this point (about to be 10 days) has been a relapse point for me. I don't want to go that road this time. I need to make it through. So checking in for today. It helps so much to look at everyone's posts and see the numbers by your names. A visual reminder that yes it can be done. Others have scrambled and struggled with every day work and life problems but they don't have to drink over it. So perhaps I don't have to either. IWNDWYT

Well you're not drinking today and this is the most important day.  Worry about tomorrow tomorrow.  The 24 hours stack up and stack up on each other.  You can do it.  What is your soft goal?  How about two weeks first and then go from there?  Make a new plan once you get there?  You can do this!
Once I got some sober time in I noticed things like work stress go down a lot. While drinking the dumbest little things aggravated me to the point I'd stew about them even at home for days months even...After calming my mind by removing the booze things got a lot better.
I used This Naked Mind and Allen Carr and decided to internalize what they were explaining about addiction.  I have hardly had cravings for the last 500 days. That's what did it for me. Basically consciously identifying and  naming  in my brain the cravings as part of the addiction cycle helped me to eliminate their power. I also used every anxiety  trick  in the book. Exercise family time essential oils comedies on Netflix reading etc.
