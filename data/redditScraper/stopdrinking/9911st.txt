My most recent relapse is proving to be the most unhealthy and dangerous one yet. The past several weeks I've been replacing my first two meals (on workdays) with vodka and caffeinated drinks. To think I could drink like that and still lose weight (as someone who has struggled w body issues for years)... this has not been a helpful discovery. I usually excercise but I started limiting my workouts due to bouts of vertigo which my docs have not been able to help me with. So in an effort to lose weight I have discovered this new horribly unhealthy and addictive hack that allows me to get a hard buzz numb the discomfort of vertigo and self loathing while losing weight...I have a wife and kid whom I love more than anything but I'm also horribly sad and depressed and even though I come off like a good parent and handle my responsibilities on some days I feel completely worthless and horrible. The deception and shame and the damage I'm doing to my body. I'm also scared I'll be found out at work and will lose my job...I'm going to jump on the wagon again today. It's going to be hard...I realize I sound sick. I have been an alcoholic for many years and it's never gone this far. I have no one to talk to. I would feel ashamed even bringing this up in AA. But first things first. I need to stop drinking NOW.

Hey you're in the right place. And you're doing the right thing: being really honest about how you're hurting yourself and why you need to start being better to yourself. You are not alone and you have us to talk with too. The shame and self loathing you feel around this issue is just more of the addiction talking. I promise you everyone at AA has heard much worse. ..It's okay to be sick. Alcohol makes us all sick. Now you know you need to get better. You are worthy of being healthy. You are worthy of taking good care of your body. You can do this. It's not easy but it's so worth it and there is support here 24 hours a day. Here's to day one. I will not drink with you today. 
I'm trying to get my first 2 consecutive days right now. I am also a husband and father. Keep telling myself they deserve better. Have been trying and failing. I'll go one night and then find an excuse to drink the next then I'll drink everyday for a week or more before taking another night off. I didn't drink tonight. Hoping I can say that again tomorrow night. Everyone has demons they fight. Good luck bud! 
If you said this at my AA home group a lot of people would be nodding their heads because they have done the same. You don't have to feel ashamed in the company of people who understand what you're going through. Getting sober has helped my body image issues significantly. But that's neither here nor there. You are worth so much more than this. 
I think by the time we show up here or at Aa for the most part we are way past the judging of others.  We've been there and know!  I'm cheering for Yu.

42 and a dad. I have an 11 year old and an 8 year old. 50 days in.  Never in my wildest dreams did I think I could get this far. Just take it day by day and minute by minute. Read  this naked mind . IWNDWYT!
You may want to talk to your doctor and be honest. From my experience drinking in the mornings was a really quick way to some pretty bad withdrawals when I quit. Good luck!
You are sick. You're welcome to talk to us or you can just talk with God directly in your heart. Be honest with yourself and with Him. The rooms helped me immensely but it was God who saved my life. I'm praying for you.
Not saying you need to go the AA route but by far one of the best things about those meetings is getting some perspective on your addiction and the crazy things it makes us all do. You can walk in there feeling like a pile of garbage knowing that you are the worst of the worst in a hundred ways and then an hour later walk out feeling like you're more or less in the middle of the pack. Also after a couple meetings you've probably made a few friends you can open up about this to. ..TLDR: There's a lot of shame associated with addiction in my experience the people in meetings like AA help get through some of that. 
Welcome!  You're not alone.  I used to replace one or two meals with alcohol and caffeine.  I think it's pretty common actually.  There is nothing to be ashamed of.  Alcohol is a tricky drug that fools many of us in many ways. ..I experienced a lot of wonderful benefits when I stopped drinking.  I hope you will too.  Like others here I also recommend *This Naked Mind*.  That books helped me to diminish my desire to drink....I also found that having an N/A drink in my hand at all times really helped in the first month or two.  Soda water in particular but also water tea coffee juice etc...Stick with us!  We're here for you.    
I never used to eat while drinking. It nearly killed me twice. Be strong!
Many of us can feel your pain. I used to go weeks without eating a real meal because I didn't want it to ruin my drunk. I began to realize every time I quit part of the overwhelming ill feeling was the fact that I had no nutrition in me. Can't imagine how my gut bacteria suffered not to mention liver etc.  For me drinking my vodka/sugary drinks for days on end without eating also sped up the development of diabetes which runs in the family. The last few times I went out my time frame has become shorter and shorter. Alcohol is poison with calories. Once I got to a certain point and recognized it it became a quicker downfall each time. That being said some of the best meals I have ever eaten have been that first meal when I got my appetite back. You are in that unique position where life looks really bad right now just remember it looks equally as good on the other side of this. You can do it!
Trust me yours is not the worst story compared to those I've heard at AA meetings.  No one gets to AA on a winning streak.   ..Hearing the stories at meetings gave me a glimpse of what my life would look like if I kept drinking.  And I said 'No thanks I'll get off the elevator down right here.'..Most importantly you'll hear stories of how great the sober life can be.   You can the the kind of husband and father your family deserves.  Keep trying don't give up you can do this.
&gt; bouts of vertigo which my docs have not been able to help me with..Could the vertigo be from not eating + drinking + working out?..I stopped eating the last few months of my drinking career... mostly because I couldn't physically get food down but getting thinner was a "nice" side effect I thought. Until I turned yellow and got hella sick with alcoholic hepatitis. Replacing food with booze was when my drinking went from drinking **way too much** to drinking **suicidally** and my body couldn't handle that shit very long. ..Reading and participating here on SD and reading books from [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/books) have been a HUGE help to me. I'm alive and actually enjoying it! Please stay safe. I won't drink with you today.  
AA is the exact place you should bring it up. We understand. You are sick right now with the disease of alcoholism. ..Getting sober is rough really rough. You don't have to go it alone. If you don't want AA look for another support mechanism. Also consider a doctor who understands addiction to help you with the medical aspects. ..The only requirement for AA is the DESIRE to stop drinking. Alcoholism is a disease with a physical component. 
You're not alone in taking this bold step forward!
on a positive note at least you WANT to stop drinking.  You may not know how to do it yet but at least you understand that drinking is a problem. 
I only ever went to one AA meeting. I think it's worth going to at least one. All the people there are going through the same thing. If you don't like it then you don't have to go anymore...For me it was the fact that I knew AA existed and what it was exactly that helped me. I knew it was there for me if I needed it and that everyone there is super helpful and supportive...I know how guilty and ashamed drinking can make a person feel but you still have a job a family a life. There are people at AA who had absolutely nothing. They're not going to judge you or think less of you...At least check out one meeting. You might like it. And if you're like me and it's not quite your speed at least you know where it is and that everyone there can be your support if you end up needing it later...Good luck!
I was right where you are 5 weeks ago today. I am "successful" and fortunate enough to have a good life and knew I wasn't able to kick it without serious withdrawals so I checked into a hospital and they filled me full of vitamins IVs etc. Wife was thankfully very supportive and understanding albeit a bit worried as she didn't realize how bad I had gotten because I could mask it well and get my shit done. ..5 weeks sober today. Haven't had more than 2 days sober in 10 years. You can do this. Pulling for you man...
