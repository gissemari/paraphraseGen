The only way you can fail quitting alcohol is by not trying anymore. I've relapsed a few times and been so down about my 'failure'. Until I realised I haven't failed because I'm still fighting it.

My relapses while regrettable  helped me define my triggers and weaknesses.   Consequently I am now more aware of where I have to be extra vigilant and apply my emotional strengths and sobriety tools.  Relapses really do suckered and take an emotional toll be they need not be without a certain kind of value.  It has taken me an embarassing number of relapses for me to realize the truely insidious nature of the beast and how I let it manipulate me even when I arrogantly thought I was in control.
I cannot echo enough what clearwater63 is saying.   The lapses teach us new things or reinforce lessons learned.  Success without failure doesn't really exist in this world.  Think about how much effort we put into drinking.  Think of all the money we put into drinking.  That was real work!  That was real money!   ..Getting and staying sober is real work.  Some of the most satisfying and beneficial work you'll ever do.  So when you fall down get back up.  Every hour sober is a step in the right direction...You have a whole world of people who are still fighting this fight right along side you today.  Best of luck and let's keep not drinking for the day. 
Right on.
