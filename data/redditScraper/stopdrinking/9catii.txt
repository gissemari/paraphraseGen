I'm trying to join but it's kicking out my user name.  I know it's right?
This is a great place to be.  It allows you to post your fears and successes to help share what youre going through.  ..Ive found it most helpful to learn that SO many people are going through the same thing with all the same fears and questions.  In day to day life you get the feeling like youre the only one the weird one but its not true lots of people are struggling...Welcome
