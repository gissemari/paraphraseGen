I am writing this on behalf of someone very close to me who has begun to show serious symptoms of alcoholism - we'll call him 'Tim'.  The bottom line is that I just don't know how to go about addressing it and helping him.  He is barely making ends meet which has driven some drinking tendencies beyond what they may have been otherwise.  Even worse he doesn't have any insurance to cover any professional treatment. ..Within the past week Tim joined some friends and myself at their home whereby he showed up beyond intoxicated.  For context this all occurred before three in the afternoon.  As we spent time outside on a dime he became increasingly agitated and attempted to start a physical altercation with some passing neighbors.  They did nothing to antagonize him - just simply passing by the home on their bikes.  This type of behavior has begun to materialize into a pattern - a strong dependency on alcohol in all situations where we interact.  There is no clear demarcation between social drinking and alcoholism but Tim is demonstrating very clear alcoholic tendencies.  In this past instance he was carrying a bottle of alcohol that everyone assumed was water but later came out to be vodka.  It is difficult to express how tremendously upsetting it is to spectate this lifestyle of someone so close to me.  And this doesn't just bring me immense sorrow thinking about how he is wrecking his life it concerns me that he could become agitated to the point where he would cause harm to someone else...This leads me to now.  I have never had an experience quite like this.  I deeply care for this person and cannot stand to see them dismantle their life.  Their should be so many more years ahead in their life but instead are drinking them away.  With no insurance I have absolutely no idea what resources are available for someone struggling with alcoholism.  This is very much a decision that he will have to make but if I have any intention of bringing this up to him I would like to at least have an idea of tools that he can use in this rigorous path to regaining sobriety.  Please I am be beyond indebted to anyone who would be willing to share some guidance or insight into this situation.  Certainly this is not a completely unique situation however I'm at a loss of direction.  Thank you to anyone in advance for your response...
