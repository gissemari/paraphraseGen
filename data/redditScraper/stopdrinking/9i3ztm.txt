Without this incredible book I would likely have relapsed by now. Instead I am nearly one month into my freedom from that horrible life-sucking addiction. It all started innocently enough 20+ years ago when a family member insisted I have just a taste of some wine her boss had given her for Christmas. Drinking that small amount triggered some sort of tension release that I needed at the time and so from that day forward I drank more and more wine most days to get that same  release  until I was hopelessly addicted and embarrassingly thought I'd never be free from it. A few weeks before reading Kick The Drink...Easily! I read This Naked Mind which was a good starting point but Jason's approach really spoke to me and reached that place in my mind to turn that switch off. The StopDrinking reddit page is where I learned about the mind-body connection and these books so I am grateful to this community and their willingness to share to help others like myself. Thank you everyone!

I liked this book too. It was the first one I read then Allen Carr then Naked Mind...It was a nice way to ease into it. I kept having so many 'a-ha!' moments while reading...IWNDWYT  
I love to hear book recommendations other than naked mind so thank you! I liked the Annie Grace's book but it doesn't quite click for me in the way it seems to for other people around here. Thanks for sharing! IWNDWYT &lt;3
