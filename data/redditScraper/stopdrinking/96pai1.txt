I had been worried about this weekend with my wife out of town. Friday night was home with the kiddo who goes to bed at 8 and plenty of wine in the house. A perfect opportunity to drink a bottle or two. ..Last night was in a suite at a big concert surrounded by booze drinkers and music (that harkens to fun times drinking). And again no one to check me as no one at the show has been looped in on my non-drinking yet. ..I didn't stay strong and fight through it struggle waiver nothing. I simply had zero interest. ..Drinking didn't  cross my mind the entire weekend. I actively thought about it from an attentive keeping an eye out for triggers perspective but in those situations merely marveled at the fact that what I thought would trigger me didn't affect me whatsoever. ..And I had a blast particularly at the show. I told my wife afterwards  while I was driving home that I can't fathom how booze could've made that show better but I could certainly see how it could've made it worse (where's the next drink over doing it saying dumb shit not remembering driving the hangover....) ...She replied  I'm so proud of you you sound so happy.  So that was a cherry on top for sure. ..IWNDWYT

Awesome. I went to a concert last night too. First night out with the wife in a while (new baby) and first concert sober since high school. Wifey had a couple but I had zero desire. I credit This Naked Mind with helping me challenge my assumptions about booze. I have been running experiments to demonstrate to myself that booze is not needed to have fun or enjoy life. Last night was another successful experiment. Had a blast and I am up early and ready to charge today. Have a great one and IWNDWYT.
