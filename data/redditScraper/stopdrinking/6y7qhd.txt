Today is Day 16 and school starts tomorrow for my kids. I can hardly believe summer vaca is over already! I sure wish that I could've stayed sober for the whole thing....that I never relapsed back in June &amp; could've been approaching 5 months. ..But I'm also very grateful to be where I am....and that I was sober for most of it. And that's in large part to SD. Finding this community gave me a place to check in to express myself &amp; to not feel alone. Thank you for that. ..I still have a bunch of things to get on the supply list need to get lunches and outfits together and somehow fit in a few hours work on top of that. If I was still drinking I'd be a ball of anxiety right now. Instead I'm able to view it for what it is....just a really busy day that I'll get thru.....Thanks SD and I won't drink with you all today!

Nice job Kota! Sounds like you're going to be busy with all the school stuff for the children - for me busy is *good*...it kept me focused (and in my case out of trouble lol)! ;) I'm so glad that you're doing well thanks for the update and good luck with the first day of school!
