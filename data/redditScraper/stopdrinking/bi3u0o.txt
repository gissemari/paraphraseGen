This is the biggest takeaway thus far. I have struggled with both for as long as I have been an adult started drinking at 15. The fact that I have tried prescription meds and other things to no avail but just not drinking and working out every day can take care of it blows me away. ..Got three hockey games to go to this week and a concert. The only thing I am worried about is missing the gym. Excited to not drink. To drive both ways. To remember it all. ..Anyways thanks for reading. I don't even feel like drinking today.

Well done and congratulations on two weeks. I'm on day 6 and it's good to know the depression and anxiety may go!
That's awesome! This post makes me really happy. :)
So awesome! Congrats!
Having the depression and anxiety gone after a few weeks of sobriety was what finally decided it for me...I'd dealt with them a large part of my life along with alcoholism...Well guess which was driving which...So much better having that clarity and focus back.
Congrats on 2 weeks
