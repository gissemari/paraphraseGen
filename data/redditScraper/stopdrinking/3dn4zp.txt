I know my badge says 39 and that is correct but I can't post tonight and will be on the road this weekend so I wanted to go ahead and write this today.  Feel free to comment on it but it is really meant to be here for me when the rationalizations start coming.  ..In February I had a good quit going after a few false starts this year.  Raised Catholic I latched onto Lent as a good time to see if I could stop for 40 days.  For those of you who are not familiar it is common for Catholics to "give up" something for Lent (the 40 days before Easter) although I can't recall the rationale at the moment.  ..I did it with no real struggles and then literally drank on Day 41.  I think I knew I would drink when I did all along and wasn't too upset with myself as 40 days was an accomplishment when I hadn't gone more than a week in months.  It picked up a bit through April (I keep a record of days I drink so I can't lie to myself about that) and May was essentially every-other day.  The first week of June was five out of six days which I don't think I had ever pulled off before.  ..So Trobbits 40 days.  Well done.  But don't go down the Trobbit hole because it has gotten deeper than it used to be and it is harder to climb out of.  You think you will be okay through August because you are training for that race but don't kid yourself.  If you don't make reminding yourself that you can't drink an everyday task you will be hungover Monday morning.  I know you.  You got to 40 days.  You just accomplished a lot of things.  Sunday night is sitting there like a amber-and-ice filled rocks glass on a silver platter with no one but you to know if you pick it up or not.  It's true you can drink if you want to and no one can tell you what to do.  But I am telling you now; you don't want to.  Let's at least try to finish "Dry July" before we start listening to those voices.  Be someone your family can trust and count on.  You won't regret it.
