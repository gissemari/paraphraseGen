He doesn't normally do stuff for me. But he thought since I have little work and no school and my husband is busy at work I might relapse. So he offered me a trip to the family compound. Not sure but it seems genuine. This will be hard for me because I have deep resentment towards him. His new wife (number 5) will be there and her daughter. He's always given to his wives and their family and not his own kids. anyways this wife is actually nice and smart idk how he landed her. The rest were psychotic. Sobriety pulls back the curtain on resentment and I hope I don't make a scene. But I'm not holding back much these days. I do get to see my grandma tho and she is an old school Al-anon member so she's a good listener. It will be good to see the family property it's on Lake Superior. Anyways wish me luck

I wish you luck I have personal experience with exactly the situation you feel resentment about.  .Since you are going to Lake Superior it made me think of a short movie I watched recently that anyone can find on you tube.  It's called Surfer Dan: Catching Waves 1000 miles from the sea.  ..He mentions during the film that he quit drinking.  He may be crazy but he is sober.   I will not drink with you today.
