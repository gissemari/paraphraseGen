Wow what a morning.... I have been making it a point to spend an hour a day going through probably thousands of personal digital photos on my PC in an effort to organize them. What an emotional ride.... I regret my regrets sometimes..... Pictures of me happily sober years ago pictures of me drinking smiling and miserable. pictures of ex wives and girlfriends family units that are no longer intact. pictures of people places and things that make me laugh out loud and others that bring sorrow and sadness. It has been a beautiful life thus far :) pictures of my kids 51015 years ago they grow so fast. i just got an invitation to my oldest sons wedding :) I didn't need an invite i am in the wedding party but it just made everything so real. :) He sent me a text on Fathers day that was heartfelt and touching made me cry.... I refuse to delete it from my phone.... I have been a force in peoples lives sometimes negative and sometimes positive...so life goes. I am thankful for all the sober time i have amassed in my Adult years the years raising kids trips we have taken and quiet moments at home. I have not been able to stay continuously sober. But i will say that every sober day has had serious effects and repercussions  on me and those around me. I relapsed after some 13 and 2/3 years sober and have spent the last 9 years struggling with my alcoholism some sober time and most not. I just had a physical and all my blood work came back very positive and healthy.The nurse said "keep doing what your doing" I probably had like 45 days when she called with the results. Just so you know even if you relapse every day sober counts in some way or another exponentially in our lives. It is better not to relapse (the quitting thing just keeps getting harder and harder) and i feel lucky to be alive at all but do not give up on yourself.  In spite of my personal struggles I have been able toat timesbe a positive force in the lives of those around me. I really do not know if I am even going to post this will have to read it over. Just decided to start typing as i was overwhelmed with emotions while looking at those pictures. I have a 14 year old in the other room that is counting on me today. Too be his dad to listen to him when he vents to be his rock when he is confused and fearful about life to provide him some guidance and structure. He eats like crazy:) hahahaha I want to be sober and alive so I can go to his wedding some day... I'm fucking crying....this is hard sometimes but life is beautiful pain and sorrow walk hand in hand with beauty and happiness. I do regret my regrets sometimes....Just have to learn my lessons pick myself up dust myself off hold my head high and keep moving forwardsober one day at a time. I look back at what i type and keep forgetting to hit the space bar. My mind thinks i didbut my fingers don't necessarily follow direction :) I am really enjoying my morning walks with my dog. My nightly bowl of icecream is awesome as well.... Taken me a long time to learn that the little things in life are the most important.... Keep it simple SD.... Don't know if anyone will get anything out of this But i do know that keeping things stuffed away inside is not good for me. Just Today :)

Yes the little things in life I am enjoying too. I have found that I am much calmer sober. My family says that I seem happier that I am visibly happier! I love this. Wish I would have stopped years ago but even at 55 years old I'll take it. Good luck to you.
This sure brought a tear to my eye!  There are so many things you said that ring true to me. ..Those bowls of ice cream or cereal or whatever sweet treat are my reward for a sober day.  ..Thank you for sharing and yes I did get something out of it!
