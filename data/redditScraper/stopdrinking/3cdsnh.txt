I am so tired of drinking and the stupid outcome that always happens from it.  I drink because I am bored and lonely. I have a great life and yet I waste the hours away in the evening by drinking.  I am a binge drinker not everyday but when I do drink it can stop or sometimes not.  I am just ready for a change and need to make it happen.  I am not a weak person I have had my share of struggles and beat them I have to beat this not just for me but for my family.  I have so much to be thankful for and am blessed in so many ways that I cannot see myself letting alcohol control me anymore I am stronger than this. Starting on a 30 day goal of not drinking.

Awesome Goal! I wish you the best.  Every day I say a prayer asking for help to people who need it.  Hopefully some of those thoughts come to you and help out!
Having the awareness and strength to see the problem in front of you and then come up with a plan to stop for 30 days is an amazing first step. Check out the FAQ and sidebar and find some details for your plan. I tried AA and found it to be an invaluable resource for me. Congrats on deciding to make a change now take action: hit the pillow sober tonight. Keep it up!
Welcome. When I was truly ready to quit I became willing to do whatever it took including reaching out for help. For me strength and willpower were irrelevant. It all depended on my willingness to change. Good luck!
