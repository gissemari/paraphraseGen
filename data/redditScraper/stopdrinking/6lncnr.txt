Hello all :) I am new to this group and thought I could share that today is my day one. I've spent the past 3 years struggling alone every night and sick every morning and after so many failed attempts at getting better I'm finally taking the first step. I'm going to my first meeting tonight and this time I'm promising myself that I'll stay sober. In the past the longest I could go was about 3 days until I felt that sickness coming on. But today is the day. I am going to get sober starting right now. If anyone has any advice on how to stop those cravings it would be greatly appreciated!

Candy! Don't worry about weight a lot of us put it on in the beginning. A lot of sugar in alcohol your body craves it! I choose bubble gum proven to lower anxiety. I'm sure I looked like an ass sometimes because I wasn't chewing but more so grinding my teeth at someone but that's what works for me! As for the meeting: keep an open mind remember that some meetings are just shitting one time some all the time and there are sick people in the program and in everyday life too.
Avoid triggers!  ..For me this meant driving a different route so I didn't pass a liquor shop.  I stopped watching sport because of the alcohol advertising in it also stopped listening to the radio in the car for the same reason.  Avoid eateries where booze is on the menu avoided going out with or talking to (at least in the early days) friends who would steer me to drinking.  I avoided bbqs birthdays etc...  Deal with Hungry Sad Angry Lonely Tired before they make you crave...I've taken the money I would spend on drinking and have put it into good quality food (and food that spoils me!) ie. generous cuts of red meat roast meals etc...  I'm not used to spending like that but I remind myself that that I would have spent that money on alcohol without much thought at all.  If you don't cook order in you deserve it...As suggested sugary food to replace those cravings I like soda/fizzy water or a good herbal tea.  A vitamin B supplement and B rich foods help me too...Stimulate your brain but only to the point where you don't get too tired or where it stresses you.  Read a book research something watch a documentary stop before it wears you out (this might only be 5-10 minutes)...Embrace any agitation I clean the house hell I just wander around the house if I can't focus on cleaning do a few squats or some shadow boxing something like that...Rest watch some Netflix have a hot shower etc......Keep at it!  I will not drink with you today.
