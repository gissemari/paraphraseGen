I'm dealing with some stuff that I'd rather not put online but I am struggling with staying away from alcohol right now. I am so depressed and I physically couldn't bring myself to even go get a bottle if I even decided to. I will probably just take some chcocolate to bed and cry about it all...This post serves no real purpose. I just need to get my thoughts out somehow. Thank you to everyone for just being here.

Good luck my friend maybe one day I'll join you in freedom 
Thank God for chocolate. I have two dark bars of "emergency" stashed in my bedside table right now. Sending you hugs and I'm proud of you for feeling the emotions and staying real with yourself. Don't beat yourself up and do enjoy every wonderful bite of chocolate. 
Hang in there :)
It's already been 11 days! I'm glad you came here to vent it does get tough at times. Just know that you are not alone in your feelings and your journey to being sober. Have that chocolate have a cry you're allowed to. Keep up the good work! IWNDWYT!
It definitely has a purpose - you're venting and getting your thoughts out just like you said. I used to struggle with that a lot...and still do sometimes. But it's always better to get things out whether it's online or to someone in person. Never stuff emotions always address them. Keep going!
On 11 days tooand feeling bummed out on everything
