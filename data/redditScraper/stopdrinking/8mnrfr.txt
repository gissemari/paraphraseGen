I'm 5 months pregnant which means I am also 5 months sober. I always knew I was previously dependent on wine to cope with anxiety and stress and even boredom at times. Now being sober I don't ever reach for a glass of wine or get the urge like I use to. Social situations are harder but I'm always happier by the end when I look around and see those who have had too much and I'm always thankful I don't feel or look that way.  I usually don't have a problem cutting it off after a couple glasses but I don't think I want to go back to drinking once the baby is born...My husband and I use to bicker a lot when we would drink and he often replayed the night as if I had started the fight. Well now that I'm sober and seeing the situation with fresh eyes I'm amazed to see maybe he was equally to blame. First let me saying he is an amazing and loving husband who cares deeply for me.  He's not a casual or frequent drinker but when the mood strikes or his friends are around I see him struggle with having just a couple beers. There's often shots involved and he has a hard time cutting it off. So much so that on our weekend trip while I was pregnant I got upset with him when he wanted to stay at the bar for several hours taking shots with random guys while watching the game. Fast forward to tonight. He came home after midnight after watching the game with a buddy (also after I called and asked him to come home) and when he walked in he was clearly very drunk and ranting about how his friend wouldn't drive him home. I'm starting to get fed up with his behavior. He just finished community service today for a dumb disorderly conduct citation he got while drinking back in January. I worry because he is a very social person and says he wants to still  have fun  after the baby is born. He also works in a field where networking and drinking often go hand in hand...If I chose to be sober is it fair to give my husband an ultimatum to be sober too? I'm just so tired of being worried about him when he goes out and don't want to have a child in that type of household.

Have you tried Ala-Anon? I used to go to it when my daughter was drinking. It really helped me.
Thank you both!
