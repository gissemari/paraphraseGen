It's getting to the end of the work day my usual time to crack open a bottle of wine and I really want to. The only thing I've got to combat the feeling at the moment is the knowledge that I have never and will never wake up in the morning regretting not drinking...As much as I want a drink right now I'm going to do future me a favour and go to my evening class go home have some fizzy water play Bioshock and go to bed...Future me will thank me later.

Good choice on bioshock and not drinking.   I've logged a lot of hours playing video games just to distract myself when I need to.  .I will not drink with you today
Way to play it forward. I will not drink with you today 
Have you ever been to our IRC? You can chat with amazing SDer's 24/7: https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/#irc://irc.snoonet.org:+6697/stopdrinking. The awesome people in that room have saved my ass through many struggles many times. ..Hang in there - it gets **much** better ;).
Fast forwarding to the next morning is one of my favorite ways to beat a craving. Waking up not hungover never gets old. Great game btw!
