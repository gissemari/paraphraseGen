Hey SD! I'm feeling great and closing in on one month in my first attempt at long term sobriety. I've taken a week or two off here and there and even a month once but these were always predetermined amounts of time. I sort of just white knuckled through it until I thought I had done  enough time to go back to my old ways. ..This time has felt very different though. No cravings and I'm really enjoying all the benefits of not drinking poison. I can't see myself ever wanting to go back. That being said I know better men (and women) than me have relapsed. Those of you who got some time under your belt then went back to drinking please explain so I can maybe learn from your experience. I'd especially like to hear from people who had a relatively easy time in the beginning with little to no cravings but all stories are welcome. ..I'm feeling very confident and strong in my sobriety right now but I know that alcohol addiction can sneak back up on you. Knowledge is power and who better to learn from than my army of sober internet friends. Thanks in advance for sharing!

I felt the same way this time.  I had a lot of two week false starts but then this time I just lost all desire and craving for drink.  But I didn't just say "that is that then" I still put work in hanging out here and reading and learning how to live a new life...The biggest thing I see with relapse stories is when people say "I am cured so I can drink again".  That is why I always say "I am cured as long as I never drink again".  As long as alcohol hasn't changed in its chemical composition I am very likely to get re-addicted to it if I start consuming it again.  That is the one and only thought I need to carry with me for life.
