I haven't posted anything here in a few weeks but I want everyone to know that I'm still sober.  This sub Reddit helped me so much in the beginning.  I still love seeing everyone's journey.  Really the first day was terrible with the hangover and cravings.  I haven't really had craving to drink since the beginning.  I guess I finally realized that life can be so much better without alcohol.  My productivity at work and home has went through the roof.  I've work out daily and have gained 12 lbs.  (I've seen many people lose weight after drinking but when I binged I would go days without eating anything and I was a little guy).  I'm current sitting in a hammock in my back yard next to a fire with my girl and some music playing.  I haven't been this content is so long.  I read something on here when I first joined that went something like this.  "I cant show you how it will be I can't tell you how it will be but once you get there you will understand". I feel like I'm getting there.  For those of you out there struggling please know that life can be so much better without alcohol.  Just checking in!..I will not drink with you today!
