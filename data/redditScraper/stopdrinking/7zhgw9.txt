I'm not sure what the point of this post is but at the least its a way to put my successes/thoughts down in print...Back on October 11 2017 I had my annual physical and a a day later my blood-work came back with some negative results.  It basically showed that I had a protein to energy need imbalance.  While there was no indication that I had liver function issues I knew that my problem my alcohol abuse...A little backstory....2.5 years ago or so I finally admitted to myself that I was overweight enough that I didn't want to continue that path so I changed my eating and exercise habits and six months later was 50lbs lighter and well in the lower percentile of healthy weight.  About three months into my journey of weight loss my wife joined me and she lost 30+lbs and is in the same healthy range as me.  She hit her goal weight a few months after me so there was some struggle within her about how I was able to eat more but for the most part until she got to her goal weight and saw how I was still eating more than her (I am taller and exercise quite a bit more than her) did my drinking problem evolve from a bad habit to health risk.  At some point in spring of 2017 to avoid hearing about how my plates were so full of food and how I was eating everything in the house I cut back to eating the same portions as her and then substituting the rest of my caloric needs with alcohol...Back to the main story .At this point my daily drinking habit of 20+ years with no breaks of more than day that consisted of 1-5 drinks (typically 3-5) was elevated to 10-15 drinks a day...I already knew I had a a drinking problem years and years prior my physical and resultant blood-work but the results was the sign that I had to deal with it...When I hung up the phone after hearing the results I broke down in tears on my knees and committed to stop drinking daily.  In my mind that meant no more drinking alone no more during the week for the most part and not making it a social requirement.  I honestly was so scared that I couldn't make it that night let alone until the weekend.  ..I somehow made it through the night without a drink...and then the upcoming weekend...and then the next five weeks.  ..The very next time I had a drink was able to stop (and actually didn't want more) after three while watching a football game.  Over the next few weeks I had a few drinks (1-3) one of each the weekend evenings.  At some point after a few weeks my craving for any alcohol seemed to go away. Since Thanksgiving weekend I've had a total of five beers over three sittings which of my last two were on my birthday January 23rd.  In each of this sittings I had no desire to desire to have anymore than I had and by the way I also feel no guilt about having the drinks. ..So here I am now nearly five weeks since my last drink I have no desire to have anymore.  I don't see what I have to gain by having alcohol.  I enjoy the taste of beer sure but there are plenty of other things that are healthier than that I enjoy.  The only reason to me to have a drink is to appease my wife.  She has expressed to me on more than one occasion while she thought I drank too much she didn't think I had a problem.  She says that she misses having someone to have a glass of wine with at dinner a beer with while watching a game the keg of home-brew in the fridge (yes I was an avid home brewer prior to October 11th.) .etc.  While she certainly doesn't drink too much in the last 10 years I'm not sure if I can recall her having more than three drinks in a sitting however she does have one drink a day.  I know this is nothing more that something she enjoys as she was able to stop for 9+months on three separate occasions when she was pregnant...Again I'm not sure what the point of this post really is Does this resonate with anyone here?  Maybe helpful to others?  My just purely an outlet for my thoughts?

Hi. One part I can address is the change part. When we quit drinking our partners get the change too whether they asked for/wanted it or not. Most posts I see on here are parters who have begged their SOs to *stop* drinking not the opposite but I know it goes both ways. My wife still drinks (she doesn't have a problem) but she also says she does miss going out with me like we used to...I guess I don't have any advice but just to say that when you're married or partnered our change is very often their change too and that's just...well...hard sometimes because Change. ..I hope you continue to be able to articulate what you need to do for yourself because at the end of the day that's all we can control. Hugs.
