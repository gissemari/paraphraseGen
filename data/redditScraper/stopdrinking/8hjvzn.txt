Oddly for me nights seem to be the easiest so far. Every late morning through the early evening it is on and off thinking about how I don't need this and  Does it really hurt anyone?  (Me duh) thoughts over and over. I can get distracted a bit but it's painfully irritating...It seems this is the time where I keep thinking I should be in a rehab just to be forced to break out of that thinking. I know this is normal in the beginning since I have been to rehab before...but I also didn't feel I had the option to leave. I didn't know anything about AMA really...I know it is going to take time for me to feel better and more positive. I just didn't think sobering up a second time would be harder than the first time. I had a stronger feeling of  I can't keep doing this shit  and got myself help as a teen. Now it isn't as intense. I know I feel the guilt and regret when I drink and it makes me HATE drinking...but I want a stronger desire to be sober. I'm just not liking this mental struggle in my head. I do remember being this mad the first week but I feel it's grown exponentially in comparison. ..I think I need to start finding some time in my day to just have a good cry over this. I've been reading the AA book and that's at least let me have a peaceful sleep so far. It seems it reminds me of how good it started feeling to read it and be thankful I was sober...Fuck Day 2 has been hard. But I'm still sober and will wake up with 0 regrets so there's a positive...

Day two is always hard but you're nearing completion and you didn't drink. Yay! Tomorrow will be another day free of regret with a fresh start to better yourself. Step by step you're on the road to real recovery. You'll find reasons to stay sober keep looking for those and hold 'em close...Be very thankful you've got sobriety. Know you're always in good company here. :)
Days 2-5 are tough as hell. You are doing great!
