Hit 5 months without alcohol today! That's pretty rad. Now begins the real test because I'm going to quit smoking starting today. Weed has helped me so much over the last five months but I'm now confident I can go without either. So sorry If I'm a little crabby over the next few weeks. I am very excited to see what I'm capable of once everything is out of my system. I'm working on saving money building habits and being more mindful. The idea of where/who I want to be in 5/10 years is finally starting to take shape and I'm realizing how much work that is really going to take. Without these substances weighing me down I believe I have what it takes to cultivate a happy and meaningful life. Thanks everyone for the continued support understanding motivation and caring. I would never have made it this far if I didn't have something to strive for and being a better person for those I love is the biggest motivation. If anyone is struggling with an addiction or depression issue do not hesitate at all to contact me...This was my Instagram post! All of you should follow me on my sobriety journey there. @breadlysandwich..Quitting does not solve the issues that you think it would. After being sober you come to find out that it actually takes a lot everyday to achieve the things that you want to. It just becomes a lot easier to do those things without alcohol impeding in your form. Big tip for those just starting you must replace the alcohol with something! For me it was writing. I've been working on multiple stories and large book. without those things to fill my time I could see myself easily falling down the hole of alcohol again. So stay busy! Even if it's hard even if you don't want to! It's so important you find an outlet. And just know it does become easier. You will be happier! Your problems will finally have to be confronted but oh does it feel good to take care of things that have been on your mind for years! It's glorious most of the time and mildly frustrating the rest. Stay strong everyone! ..IWNDWYT

Way to go! 
I quit smoking weed almost 3 weeks ago! I was sober for a while at the end of last year then relapsed. I got sober again on January 4 and this time I quit smoking too. It's been surprisingly easy and it's cool to say I'm *completely* clean and sober. Good luck man
