*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*..**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**. I'm pledging myself to not drinking today no matter what happens good or bad--and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others...It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours lets not drink alcohol!..------..**This pledge is a statement of intent.**.Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!..What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up...**What this is:** .A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning...**What this isn't:** .A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread...------..This post goes up at:..```.US - Night/Early Morning  .Europe - Morning  .Asia and Australia - Evening/Night.```..A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar...------..Good Morning from Scotland!..Today is my final day hosting the check-in - thank you so much for all your posts and chat this week and thank you to /u/pllist for taking the mantle for next week! You're all in capable hands :)..I've posted this week about struggles about helping ourselves and each other through this journey of sobriety (not *to* sobriety - this journey isn't one that ends!) and about how every day is Day 1 so you need to focus. But amidst all of the thoughts about staying sober and the hassle of day-to-day life I hope you can all take some time out to celebrate the successes that you've had...For me right now I'm celebrating getting through what's been a pretty tough week completely sober. And I'm celebrating the progress I've made on my personal well-being...I'll see you all in the check-in tomorrow!..-Bone
----------immediate responses--------

I'm in IWNDWYT 
I didn't drink in Aus with you today and I won't tonight!
Friday was a very difficult day but I feel accomplished in the fact I made it through it. Longest stretch since my drinking began and I couldn't thank you all enough for this group...IWNDWYT! 
Morning from the UK - Thanks for hosting this week Bone! Glad you got through a tough week. My house is a midden and Ponylad 1 home from university on Sunday. I hate housework - I will not drink with you today   
i will not drink today.
I will not drink with any of you today!
I ordered a mocktail with dinner and my husband had two beers. Weirdly I was cool with his drinking and my not. I did not drink yesterday and I will not drink with you today..*By the way it was a mojito without the rum extra mint. If you're not into mint you can order lavender syrup and add to soda water with lemon. Great summer drinks sans liquor.
Just for today ..I will not drink..I will.....- Nourish myself with reading meditation and food.- Slow down during my day and keep things simple .- Greet every person with the kindness of a long lost friend
I'm celebrating the fact that being sober has allowed me to pursue the interests that I'm actually passionate about and to meet people who are kindred spirits...At the start of the year I wrote a new year resolution to make 5 new friends which seemed laughably out of reach when I was spending 3 nights a week drinking alone in my room...It was very lonely at first but recently there's been a dramatic change. I have so many new people in my life and I now have friends who don't even know drunk me. I'll celebrate this with you by not drinking today.
Good morning! I have a bachelorettes party this afternoon and it is 30 degrees Celsius today. Super nice weather! I already told my friend who organizes the party that I am not drinking and she has arranged substitute drinks for me and others who don't drink. This are my girlfriends from my sorority from university back in the day and we always drink when we meet up so I am expecting some questions but I look forward to it. It's going to be great!..IWNDWYT.
I feel tired as fuck.IWNDWYT
2 months ago I missed an induction for a volunteer opportunity because I was drunk and intended to be drunk all weekend. Today was the next induction and I was there bright and early because I did not drink yesterday. I will not drink with you today either. Happy Saturday! 
Thanks Bone!  ..IWNDWYT!
IWNDWYT. Thank you.
Time to start posting these again. IWNDWYT.
It's been a tough week but I'm glad that I have stayed sober through everything. I have been fully present and able to support my SO at a very traumatic time and that means a lot. Plus I can almost taste 100 and I want to see my counter hit 3 digits! IWNDWYT 
I will not drink today.
IWNDWYT. .Looking forward to a dry sunny day here in Ireland. .
If there's no hangovers involved and lots of fun booze free weekend activities....count me in! IWNDWYT
Not today!
I have the maddest cravings for white wine. I don't like white wine and I never drank white wine but I keep seeing it and wanting it it's so strange. Iwndwyt though!
I will not drink with you all today or tonight   
Still looking for a job  staying on my ex husbands couch in a unfamiliar neighborhood  but I believe staying sober is the best thing I can do . I Will Not Drink With You Today 
Good morning.  Burning the midnight oil so technically my day hasn't started yet but I promise I will not drink once I get my Saturday started.
Insomnia again! I won't drink today!
IWNDWYT lets fucking do this!
Hey SD! I'm not drinking today...I'm getting the hell out of here and going to enjoy a long beautiful peaceful weekend with SO :).
I will not drink today. I'm getting married today :) 
I will not drink today
Morning from England. It looks like it will be a lovely day and I will be able to fully enjoy it because IWNDWYT 
Good morning SD happy no drinking day :)
Sober Saturday! Won't be drinking today. Have an exciting time everyone!  
Yesterday Friday the start of Memorial Day weekend here in the U.S. I finished grocery shopping and was walking to my car when I took notice of a man about ten years younger than me transferring *his* shopping into the trunk of his car. Now you need to know that Shop Rite has the biggest carts (I think the term is *trolleys* in Europe?) of any grocery chain in my area. His cart/trolley--whatever--was *filled* with cases of beer--loaded to the point it must have taken effort for him to push it.. .As I walked by I said out loud: "I'm glad that isn't going into my trunk."
Long work day ahead but then I'm off for 8 days with pay   IWNDWYT .My last time off from work I spent nearly every day hungover looking forward to feeling good and sober this time around!
We re experiencing record heat for spring/early summer in Scandinavia; warmest May in 80 years with close to 30 sensational C/85 fantastic F. That was weather now for food and drinks: Barbecue tonight with plenty of water and soft drinks but not a single drop of booze. IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you today!
I will not drink with you today. 
Yesterday evening was rough as since it's a three day weekend my brain was all about trying to talk me into drinking. I told it to shut up and went to bed early. So here I am sober Saturday morning with a coffee and IWNDWYT!
I will not drink with you today!
Checking in. IWNDWYT!!!!
100% not drinking today.
A little work a little gardening but no drinking here!
I'm not drinking today!
Forgot - thank you for hosting Bone! Glad you made it through a tough week they are hard but they make us stronger if we let it! 
Today is going to test me. Live soccer match later. But last night I went through this exercise where I laid in bed drunk. And I smelled the staleness of my breath and then this morning woke up way past my usual 5 AM hour feeling like a cross between dry burnt toast and one of those enormous nose zits right before it bursts and I decided that I will remain sober during tonight's match. So I'm going to add another day. ..I'm in. I won't drink today..
challenge of today is party night with friends...  taking cordial and fizzy water and may leave early..IWNDWYT
Happy Saturday troops I'll join you in not drinking today. And don't forget we're all Liverpool fans tonight am I right.
I will not drink with you today but I will be a better uncle brother and friend.
I will not drink today no matter what happens. I love being sober!
DAY 3   and I will get to 4!!!!  IWNDWYT
Not drinking alcohol today. Heading to the beach! 
So bummed about everything at the moment I feel like all the changes I've been trying to make are amounting to nothing. I feel so stuck. But - I don't want to drink and that's a big change from where I was less than a year ago. So perhaps ironically sobriety is the only thing that's working for me at the moment. IWNDWYT. 
I will not drink today.
Good morning! I'm 123 days today. Bought a nice piece of halibut at the fish market last night and we're looking forward to grilling this afternoon. First thought someone is looking at our house who may be interested in buying it. Lots of cleaning to do this morning. Gym. Busy day. I am stocked up on the holy water trinity of La Croix Perrier and San Pellegrino and have lemons and limes sliced and diced to go with. Have non-specific plans for an ice cream treat of some kind later too. Sober summer here I come! I will not drink with you today.
Not drinking TODAY! It's 6:39 a.m. on Saturday May 26 2018. For 24 hours or until 6:39 a.m. on Sunday May 27 2018 I will not drink ethanol in any form whether it be wine beer or spirits.
IWNDWYT 
I will not drink today.
Not today.
I will not drink today!
Heading to Chicago today for the holiday weekend. It will be my first trip there sober. I will not drink today or at all this weekend!..I will be with family which will help a little bit. My sister is who we are visiting though and we always drank together when I visited in the past. Luckily she is very understanding and supportive I think...
I will not drink with you today 
Going to a wedding where IWNDWYT...(Shouldn't this check in be stickied so it's at the top of SD?)
No booze today!
I'm new here. (15 days sober) I will not drink with you today. 
It's early days here but feeling good about it.  My first Saturday night sober for some time.  Feels good.
IWNDWYT Have a great weekend everyone! 
I will not drink today. 
I will not drink today!
Up a little earlier that usual (I had to pee) but rested and clear-headed so I may as well stay up. ..The holiday weekened looks to be a big rain-out which really really sucks but I will not drink today.
Day 5. IWNDWYT.
Have a full day planned and tomorrow.  I do not want to wake up feeling like shit in the morning.  So nope...I will not drink with anyone here today.  Not going to the store either-no tempting me...               .........
I will not drink today
Not today. Not today. Not today!!!!!!!
Day 7 - I will not drink today. (Day 1 of not smoking too!)
I will not drink with you today! Going to the zoo with the kids then swimming in this lovely weather! 
Thank for hosting this week Bone! It's a lovely sunny day here and I'm off for a walk. I will not drink with you today!..Have a lovely weekend fellow sobernauts!
I am so happy after a crazy busy week it is time for a lazy Sober Satruday!! IWNDWYT 
Thank you for hosting the check in this week Bone! :)..I will not be drinking today.  
IWNDWYT! I'm preforming at a house party today and I feel good about not drinking. ..Things are coming together at day 60. I'm finding I have the time to take care of myself now while before I felt like I was running a marathon I could never catch up with. My hair skin mind and attitude have improved. My finances are slooowwwly improving. There are still issues but I'll get there. My favorite part of sobriety so far is how well I am dealing with anxiety. If I get stressed it's not for long and I'm dealing with it a little better. It is such a relief!
Good morning from BluJul! On this day 9 I am not setting out trying not to drink.  Instead I am making a conscious decision not to drink.  NOPE NOT TODAY!!!
I will not drink today.
Thanks for hosting Bone. I will not drink with you today on this beautiful spring Saturday in New England. Bird singing an Aria at sunrise. Hope to see some on the golf course later today. Sober strong all weekend . 
I will not drink with you today! 
I will not drink today
Day 6 and feeling better than I have in a long time. I will not drink with you today! Glad I found this community!
won't drink today
I will not drink today.
If I drank yesterday I would not have been able to help a WW2 vet on his 93'rd birthday. His car broke down and I called a wrecker and his family for him. Let's see how I can be helpful to someone today! I won't drink with you lovely people today!
[removed]
I will not drink with you today.
And the three weeks of spring that we get have finally come to a close. Let summer (and humidity ugh) begin. I will not drink with y'all today!
Will not drink today.  
One more Friday down! Looking forward to getting some fresh air and sunshine this afternoon. I will not drink with you today!
here comes another day sober! IWNDWYT my friends xx
My dog ran off while I was at work last night. My husband left the gate open and my dog doesn't listen to him. My husband also decided to text me about while I still hours left in my shift so I was a big ball of stress and anxiety about it. But when I got home from work *I didn't drink!* I didn't console myself with alcohol. In stead I went for a run at the gym which really cleared my head and untangled the knot in my stomach. Now I'm getting ready for the day and waiting for the shelter to open so I can check if he's there. No matter what this day brings IWNDWYT   
None for me today! Headed to my awesome Saturday morning meeting. Happy Saturday! IWNDWYT 
Weekend is in gear. ..so is sobriety. ..I will not be drinking with you today and I will never drink again and I will never change my mind. 
Happy Caturday everyone!  IWNDWYT

Day 6 just waking up without a hangover and with another $20 in my pocket. I'm going to do it again today and NOT drink. I'm not going to buy any booze or be around it. That's going to get me through today.
Finally the weekend! ..Feeling good after a decent night sleep...I pledge to not drink today. ..IWNDWYT 
   Coffee time!   ..I will not drink with you today!
Despite feeling a little shitty this morning (not from any drinks last night!) I am deciding not to make it worse.   I will not drink today.
Hey Bone ! Thanks for a great week of hosting. Enjoyed your posts. Best to you on your sober journey! ..G-Jam
I will not drink today! Made it to 21 days. I am a big worrier mostly about something bad happening to my family. One thing I thought of today was that if there *was* an emergency they could count on me to be there to help! I used to think what if something happened and I was drunk and had to show up like that or not show up at all. Finding solace in this thought. 
I will not drink with you today!
I went to a huge party last night danced for a bit and left after I stopped having fun. I don't think I've left a party early... Ever. Throat is hoarse but I feel great. I have so much to celebrate and I'm doing it all alcohol free...IWNDWYT! 
I don't know what I will do today but I know what I won't!
IWNDWYT 
I'm drinking coffee hanging with my kids and so thankful I have a few days off from my nightmare job. I hope everyone has a great weekend. I will not drink with you guys and gals. 
Good morning! It's another beautiful hangover-free Saturday. I will not be drinking with you today!
Planning ahead today. I'm 50/50% going to a night at my wifes friends house where it'll be hard not to drink and not be noticed. But if we go (daughter is under weather so might skip) I'm just going to say "No thanks not for me tonight". I'm committed not to drink today...IWNDWYT.
IWNDWYT 13 Days. Haven't gone this long in 6 years. 
Count me in :)
Going to be a tough day but it's manageable at least! IWNDWYT

Lot's of garden &amp; lawn work to get done then dinner w/sober friends later! Thanks again! I will NOT drink with you today! Peace 
I will not drink with you today because I do not drink. Going on a little day trip I've been meaning to do for years. Thanks for hosting Bone.

Sober Saturdays are great. IWNDWYT. 
Just checking in to say wazzzuppp.Iwndwyt
Either I am sick or I have the worst allergies known to man. ..A good friend of mine from recovery has become totally dependent on (perhaps addicted to) AA. The guy isn't fun to hang out with anymore because all he wants to talk about is AA and he seems to have lost his ability to function in the real world. He goes to 3-4 meetings every day so I saw this coming. It sucks but I think I'm going to have to pull back from him for a while because after hanging out with him last night I was just in such a bad mood. 
Checking in for today.
Met up with some friends to play videogames and I showed up with Vernor's ginger ale. This is the first time I've gone out socially since I quit and I felt I was ready. I was right up front with them that I was done with the booze the events that led me here the fear of losing my wife if I go back to it etc. I was worried because I had always heard you'll learn who your true friends are. And last night I did again. I suppose it was just reaffirmed. They were totally supportive and understanding. Didn't give me any shit. Didn't give me the "well you just need to cut back" nonsense. Just listened and realized I was serious this time. And then we played games and laughed and had a blast and I left at the end of the night thinking "wow I had a great time with friends without booze!" ..Hell yeah! IWNDWYT
I finally slept  - a bunch!  Not drinking today
I will not have a drink today
Checking in. IWNDWYT!
I want to see my badge. The last couple days have been tough. 
Happy Sober Saturday everyone! I will not drink with you today.
I'm not drinking today.
Is there anything better than a sober Saturday morning?..Road tripped for 4 hours and here with the fam on the first day of our holiday. Looking forward to savouring and remembering every minute...IWNDWYT!
Will I stay alcohol free today?..Yes I will not drink with you all today.
I will not drink with you today 
Made it over a week it feels pretty good. I think this is my first sober holiday weekend in 12 years.  I will not drink with you today! 
Checking in. I will not drink with you today  
I will not drink today. Instead I'm going to an AA meeting. My first in over 18 years. ..~3 days sober
3 weeks. 21 days. Not drinking today!
I will not drink with you today. 
I will NOT drink today 
Had a date night with my wife last night. She asked if it would bother me if she got a glass of wine. It did not! I ordered sparkling water which did the trick for me...I will not drink with you today!
Woke up feeling great and I look a lot less bloated. I'm able to function this Saturday a lot better than last Saturday. ..We have plans to go to the pool with friends that are planning to drink there. I haven't quite figured out how to tell them I'm not drinking with them. ..One thing I do know is that I will not drink today.   
Good morning soberniks!  Starting this long weekend with rigorous calisthenics to keep body and mind healthy for the fight against the demon oppressor! May your weekend be sober!. Vigilance Comrades! IWNDWYT 
Happy Saturday everyone. Thanks for hosting Bone!..IWNDWYT!
No drinking today or the next 24hrs.
Not drinking today but I need to step up my game in other areas of my life LOL
I will not drink with you today.   SO and I are having an uncomfortable conversation with our 18 year old and how he is going to have to leave the house.  He has continued to make choices that are not good for him.  Tough love right?  Breaks my heart that we are having to do this.  Be kind to everyone you meet  we are all battling something.   .IWNDWYT 
i will not drink with you today
Checking in. Another sober day ahead \- IWNDWYT!

Good morning from Phoenix. I will not drink with you today.
Not today. 
Good afternoon friends. Summer came early here in Scandinavia 28C and I'm sweating at the moment. Sitting in a bar sipping on a Pepsi Max on my way home after a heavy leg day at the gym. Of course I would like to have a cpl of cold beers in this heat but there is no such thing as  a cpl of beers  for me the only reason for me to drink is to get off my tits and there is no room for that in the future I want to have. I will not drink with you today!
Hi friends! IWNDWYT!
Not having a good morning could really use a drink to calm down but I will not drink with you today.
I Will not drink with you today
I will not drink with you today!
While everyone else struggles with all the happy summer time cravings I feel like I'm dealing with the opposite. I work retail in a busy beach town. So while I don't have to navigate the picnics and barbecues I get a strong craving after working long hard shifts of "everyone else got to have a really fun day". When you get off work at 11 bars are your only real entertainment options and I'm not feeling strong enough to go see a band and not drink this weekend. Physically mentally and emotionally exhausted and in the middle of working 6 straight days but IWNDWYT. 
Round of shocking golf done and dustedgot some magnesium pills for my cramps and sore body so will sleep like a baby tonight
Not drinking today 
I will not drink today =] 
I will not drink today. 
Feeling great! I will not drink with you today!
Will be tested today. I will not drink today. 
I will not drink with you today. 
I will not drink with you today! Just got back from a run and made a healthy lunch. Hanging out with family. Have a great Saturday all!
Day 7 checking in!  Almost a week under the belt.  This is always a big one for me.  I feel like I've got some good momentum going now.  Going to spend the day in being productive! ..Stay vigilant friends.  I will not drink with all of you today! 
I'm in. IWNDWYT!
I'm in. X
Thanks and congratulations on 6 days! IWNDWYT 
So I'm in day 23!  Officially the longest I've been sober with no intention of drinking ever again.  I had a lot of anxiety about the last few days because my last relapse ended in the ER. But I'm past that and feeling just fine. IWNDWYT. 
Reset my badge didn't check in yesterday pretty much planned to slip up. Had 4 beers last night which is better than my usual 12 but I would've had just as good of a time last night without them and would feel better about myself as well as physically this morning if I had abstained. Oh well submitted my badge reset and am about to head out for a walk and get back at this thing. I will not drink with you today.
I will not drink today back to Day 1 for me. I wrote out my first step this morning and prayed. God willing I will get through the day and not have a panic attack and I will do all I can do to avoid drinking!
Feeling great. At 70 days I'm really grateful for so much in my life and feeling physically so much better. Happy even and calm. Going to a Saturday morning meeting I really love and spending the day puttering around the house and getting stuff done!
Checking in from Texas! It's hot. Won't be dehydrating myself unnecessarily :) IWNDWYT!
I love being sober..I'm glad I took the chance to really see what it's like and I've only scratched the surface!    no drinks today!  
IWNDWYT    
Entering 12th day sober! I will not drink with you today. Stay strong everyone.
IWNDWYT! 
Holiday 3day weekend  but I will not drink. 
I'm celebrating the fact that I mowed my lawn after work instead of drinking on Wednesday. Went to the store this morning for fajitas tonight. I work a pretty physical job so I also bought some Epsom salt for bath time. Today is going to be a good day. IWNDWYT. 
Tonight I plan on dinner and hanging out with this particular group of friends for the first time sober. I know I will want a beer but no matter what IWNDWYT!
I will not drink today. 
I will not drink with you today. .. 
Went home early when all of my friends started getting really loud (aka. drunk) and after I had finished my hibiscus tea which meant I skipped out on a friend's birthday but she didn't care. ..It's hard to not go to social events but I will adapt. ..IWNDWYT. 
I will not drink with you today.   
I will not drink with you today
The fourth Saturday IWNDWYT!   
One week today!!! My longest stretch since January (12 days.)..Last night was Friday night and my usual drinking night. I spent it snuggling with my fianc  watching our favorite show and talking and before we went to bed I realized - holy shit I didn't think longingly about alcohol ONCE. I was fully present in every moment. His relief and happiness is palpable right along with mine. Life is good...I feel amazing...IWNDWYT!!!
Didn't drink today and won't drink tonight!.I painted a birdhouse though!.Niki
I will not be drinking today!!  It is one month for me and my much younger sister is coming to stay. I get to spoil her with a manicure and shopping because I've saved so much this month. Looking forward to it.
I'm feeling anxious and having doubts. But I'm going to a lot of meetings and not drinking between them. IWNDWYT.
Just came back from Denmark. Funny thing. One evening while I was exploring the city I ask for an alco-free beer in one store. The shop assistant replied: Wut? Alcohol free beer? Nooooo... .   But eventually in one small market near the hotel I found incredibly tasty non-alco beer -  CPH all night . Wish one day I could buy it in my homecountry.   ..And yes it's allllmost my sober anniversary.  
Hey Bone thanks for hosting the check-in this week...I will not drink today no matter what happens good or bad.
IWNDWYT! Funny how long and productive Saturdays can be without alcohol. 
I'm not drinking today
Checking in
I have 25 days under my belt which is something I never would have thought in a million years was possible.  Today I happily take the pledge to not drink a drop today.  I love that I take the pledge in the morning then remember it when the demon brain starts in about 4:00 pm.  Gives me great strength \- thank you!!!
I'm here again and iwndwyt 
Today is a big test but I will not drink with you today!
I do not drink; therefore I will not drink with you today.
I slept in a few hours this morning. Loving that i wasnt fighting anxiety and instead embracing guilt free extra rest.   IWNDWYT 
Found an attitude of gratitude. Negative thoughts? They have no power here! IWNDWYT 
Day 2 and I will not be drinking tonight!
IWNDWYT 
I will not drink with you all today!

I will not drink today!
I had a dream last night that I drank and woke up trying to remember if I was sober or not! It was great realizing I was and that I felt good..I will not drink with you today!
I will not drink with you today :)
I will not drink with you today
I discovered this sub through my gf. I have been drinking a lot the past month. Mostly because it's fun and I'm in a new country and it's easy. ..End up going out with coworkers or playing poker with strangers and having a good time. The thing is a lot of them also smoke and then I end up having a couple of cigarettes (and I hate smoking) and wake up the next morning feeling like shit. It also makes me feel really weird and I start questioning things I am not even worried about. The other day I ended up drinking an entire bottle of wine by myself and smoked like a half dozen cigarettes and I felt so horrible afterwards. I tossed all my clothes to be dry cleaned and checked out of my hotel room because it smelled so bad ..Just before this I was losing a lot of weight and getting in terrific shape. I was trying to get my abs to show and was working out regularly. My schedule been thrown off and being in a new country away from my girlfriend has made it way too easy for me to just binge. ..Plus when I drink at night I find that I eat very unhealthy the next day. ..So this week I am visiting my son back in the US. My goal is to not drink during this week and get back on my Intermittent Fasting routine. I was good on my long flight in but on today I ended up having a cider and on today's flight I ended up having a glass of wine. But the good news is that the wine actually grossed me out. ..So I going to take a break from drinking for the next month until my girlfriend visits me. My goal is one meal a day during lunch. Lots of water. No alcohol and get back on my routine. So when I'm back next week I will get back to swimming and working out 2x a day.

Didn't drink! Did a fast instead. ..Question though do you say "I don't drink" or "I don't drink anymore"? Does the anymore invite unwanted questions/bring awkwardness to a conversation?
FUCK alcohol. I will not drink today.
I will join you for my day 4. 
I will not drink today.
Thank you for hosting. Nice job. ..I will not drink with you today.  
I will not drink today!
Checking in!! Glad to have so many people to not drink with!
I will not drink today.
No drinking for me today! Relaxing instead. It's amazing how we're conditioned to believe that alcohol relaxes us. Far from it. It makes my body work overtime to purge toxins. It deadens my immune system and nervous system and my heart would race for hours the next day. My body is thankful today for the ability to truly relax. I hope all of you have a relaxing weekend!
Ahhhhhh I woke up and have been doing something every since and I didn't even check in but since Saturday night is still to come I am pledging that I Will Not Drink With You Today!

Not drinking for the remainder of the day.  I may have not left my flat but I will certainly not drink booze.  It will make these feelings 10 times worse.
Late but here.  Enjoy the weekend.

Went out bowing tonight with friends who were drinking. They offered me drinks I told them I'm not drinking until I can see my abs again. One guy actually got inspired and stopped drinking. Score!.Day 9 it's greeting easier.  iwndwyt!
