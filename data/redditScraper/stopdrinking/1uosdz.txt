This is a cry for help I guess. ..32 days sober. 33 days ago I drank 4 beer - it [did not go well](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1sfubp/total_reset_possible_trigger_sorry/). For the last 3 months I've really been struggling emotionally- not exactly the desire to drink - drinking is how I used to cope with my emotions so more struggling to cope with my emotions. A month ago I was diagnosed with social anxiety 22 days ago I had a massive 10 hour panic attack 19 days ago I started taking anxiety/antidepressant medication (an SSRI) and 2 hours ago I had another [large panic attack](http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1uodtw/having_a_panic_attack_waiting_for_my_therapist/) (not quite as big as the last one though and it's subsiding. ..Anyway I'm not going to drink. The last time it wrecked me now I'm on medication that you're not supposed to drink alcohol on. But I think I need to go to an AA meeting. I think I need to be around other people who have struggled like I am to hear them talk and maybe even to talk a bit myself. maybe...Thanks to this wonderful crippling social anxiety I honestly don't think I can get there on my own. I tried [a year ago and failed miserably](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/137y92/failure/). ..I guess this is a cry for help. I don't know how you can help me or even if you can. But the universe has been fucking with me lately so I feel like it owes me a favor. I'm hoping someone reading this somehow can help me get to an AA meeting; keeping in mind the crippling social anxiety (which is admittedly slightly better thanks to the medication). I live in western Canada small town if that helps. ..I don't know if you can help but if you offer I'll do my best to accept your help.

Have you been to a meeting before? If this is your first time some volunteers from AA may be willing to go on a 12th Step call meet with you and probably get you to a meeting. 
Hey there. ..Hope you were able to find a meeting or some people and are feeling better. But if not and you're around there are still plenty of us online of you feel like talking...Be well.
My area AA office has a list of people who volunteer to be on call for just such situations. I hope you find someone dedicated enough to lend a hand. If not you can at least get information about current meetings and locations on the phone. If meeting Chairpersons are listed they can be called to look out for you too. I was extremely reluctant to attend my first 12 step meeting (Alanon) really scared. I met another first timer in the parking lot a complete stranger also scared and confused we were both early and the doors were still locked but together we were able to hang on to our composure long enough to get into the meeting. Once inside we both lost it completely but apparently that's to be expected! I always bring tissues to meetings AA and Alanon for the newcomers.
Please call someone preferably AA.  AA members are taught that we stay sober by helping others.  That is how AA started. It is not a burden for members to help it is a duty and a privilege. 
Taking that first step is the hardest. Just keep in mind most people here and in AA have been through many similar things. If you need someone to talk to daily please PM. We can chat via gmail if you'd like. Just don't isolate yourself entirely! Above all else LOOK! You're doing it you're staying sober you have 33 days my friend! Congrats!
I'm very impressed by your post.  There is a /r/alcoholicsanonymous where you can post as well.  Good luck and keep us posted.
Ring AA Dave you will get a real person in your locality.  There are a lot more people in AA than you think.  You can do this! Good luck.
