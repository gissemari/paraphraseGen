&gt; Whenever you feel down remember how good you're doing with your own choices. That's something you should be proud of  ...I am someone who forgets to be selfish sometimes. It actually causes me a lot of hurt when I put others first constantly. My boyfriend gave me this reminder. It may be simple but it actually made me feel a lot better to be like  hey look at you you're X days into sobriety you're eating (somewhat) healthy you look good you (for the most part) feel good etc.  If you struggle to put yourself first like me take a minute to praise yourself. Realize how awesome you are because you are choosing to be sober or choosing to try. It is something we should all be VERY proud of! IWNDWYT

Kindness starts with how I treat myself.
