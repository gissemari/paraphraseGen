Had my first drinking dream last night. I had had a glass of wine and was enjoying the first minute of buzz and then freaked out to everyone around me. The feeling was so real! Then in the dream my mind began rationalizing ... well I was 19 days into sobriety ... what's done is done but next time I won't relapse until I'm over 3 weeks into sobriety because that makes more sense ... or maybe I should make it an even number? LOL!! I feel grateful to have had the opportunity to experience my addicted brain while sober because I can guarantee that conversation would have made sense if I had had that glass of wine. But all I could do was laugh when I woke up...ETA: wanted to give a shout out to /u/coolcrosby 's [what do drinking dreams mean] (http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2dit1m/what_do_drinking_dreams_mean/) post interesting to read this morning!

Yay SohoCat reality is so much better than dreams!  I love the number 19 by the way. Happy prime number day!
Totally had a drinking dream last night too! Those things have me freaking out as soon as I wake up. Welcome to the new normal!
Those kind of dreams always trick me!! They always feel so real. Sometimes I blackout in my dreams but then when I wake up I'm so grateful it was just a dream.
