Thanks to the inspiration from this subreddit I managed to go sober for almost 2 weeks. I am a heavy drinker and that's the longest I've gone dry for at least 5 years. Here's my problem. I relapsed. Hard. When I was clean I felt amazing better physically and mentally than I have in years. It was a very freeing feeling to know I was finally away from the bottle. But like I always do I slowly crawled back to the bottle. Now I'm far worse than I was before. One of the reasons I quit was because I caught myself drinking on the job. I was doing that for almost a month before the thought even occurred to me that if I was caught I would instantly be fired. Now I've gone from a half a bottle of vodka a day to almost an entire liter a day drinking about half of that on the job. I know it will kill me and probably get me fired from a very nice job. Problem is after starting again I feel amazing. I can't explain it and I hate myself but it feels like drinking has given me a new life again. I'm more social funnier more productive better at my job no anxiety no fears fuck I'm even losing weight somehow. It's almost like the opposite of what I had become before I quit. It's very liberating. I'm sure it will all come crashing down very soon but for reasons I can't explain where before the bottle killed me right now it sets me free. My question is how can I fight these feelings? Even though it's giving me a false sense of well-being I know it's destroying me. How do I fight this?..Edit: Now that I'm actually thinking about it and not just sweeping it under the rug my guess is that it's a chemical response to my brain going back to the alcohol dependency it was so used to. Has any one else had a similar experience?

&gt;I'm more social funnier more productive better at my job no anxiety no fears fuck I'm even losing weight somehow. ..The thing is you feel that way but it might not actually be true.  You might think you're being more social and better at your job and you might be but the rapid personality shifts are probably setting off warning signals for some people...The alcoholic side of your brain is fantastic at rationalizing things to get what it wants.  You're seeing it by seeing your focus turn to alcohol solving all of your problems which you know deep something doesn't jive with that logic or you never would have stopped drinking originally.  You're not a different person and the alcohol hasn't changed its chemistry...In some ways it is liberating not to have to fight yourself like you did for those two weeks.  But the old patterns will soon reemerge and as you're seeing you're drinking more than ever so there's a chance the negative consequences will be worse than ever...Look at it this way you never hear anyone say "Ultimately I'm glad I started drinking at work" or "I thought I had a drinking problem that was crushing my life but it turns out I just wasn't drinking enough".
The addict inside you will do anything to keep alcohol as an option even if it means making you work harder at work cleaning up a bit whatever. I've  gone through plenty of times where I got "better" often to prove to myself or my long suffering wife that I could function with alcohol in my life. In the end these periods just weren't sustainable in the long run and there were always consequences. When you rearrange your life to be constantly soused you end up getting the kind of life that leads to there's just no way around that. You might be able to pull it off for a while but eventually it will catch up. Visit r/ca if you want a preview.
