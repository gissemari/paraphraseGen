&gt;Actually it's pretty fun..There's the truth.  There's nothing more predictable than being drunk and spending a night drunk.  Sure there are a lot of variables as far as the outcome is concerned but let's be honest... you pretty much know how the night will end one way or the other.  Keeping sober opens many more doors for spontaneity and it makes it much easier to live in the moment.
