Last night I relapsed and well it wasn't pretty..My SO went to work early so we didn't discuss it. I am so afraid of what will greet me.  I really want all this stuff to stop.  I hate it. I went to an AA meeting and it was about making amends which I really needed to hear. I hate making promises and breaking them. I know that actions speak louder than works and I really am motivated to change.  Any advice?

My advice is always the same (as a chronic promise breaker and relasper) NEVER STOP STOPPING. 
I let my SO down so may times with my empty promises and chronic relapsing.  I was only successful in getting sober when I did it for myself and not for him.  I needed a lot of help to quit so I sought addiction counseling attended an intensive outpatient program (IOP) and went to AA meetings.  As you say actions speak louder than words.  It took months of sober time for me for him to start to trust me again but he eventually did. I continue to stay sober with the help of AA and maintenance appointments with my addiction counselor.  I wish you all the luck and I will not drink with you today.
Sounds like something needs to change. ..You know that old dumb saying; "nothing changes if nothing changes". That applies to your behaviour as well; if you go home and do the same stay in the same cycles you will continue in the same cycle.
