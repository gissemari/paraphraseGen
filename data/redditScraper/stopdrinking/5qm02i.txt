I had a month short of a two year long relapse. Starting to feel like myself again shaking off the old skin I was rotting in. I want to love myself so I can appropriately love others. I keep thinking about all of the horrible things I did and said and I keep wondering if that is who I really am. I remember this feeling from my previous sobriety. A monster that lives inside me and how do I come to peace with that person and forgive myself for my past so I can move on. I don't want to live in the past. I want to be here and be present but I am just so.... sorry

Just take it one day at a time for now and the rest will come in time. ..At this point the thing you need to focus on the most is your sobriety. Without that you're never going to even scratch the surface of what you wrote. You are doing great.  I will not drink with you today. 
The monster is dead.  Long live YOU.
Glad you're here.  ..Accepting my past is one thing.  *Rehearsing* my past is another thing all together...I realized that I'm only supposed to experience a past event **once**.  Replaying it like an old movie is destructive to me.  It's also something my mind likes to do to me to hold me hostage to my past and sometimes to justify having a drink...I got tools and resources and support to process all my past so that I could move forward and live NOW!..
 I have to focus on doing the best I can be TODAY.  When I cling to the past it takes away from that.  The past is done today is all that I have to make tomorrow better.
