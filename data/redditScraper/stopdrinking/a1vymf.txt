Did 7 days of not drinking and 10 of drinking. :(.Now I am on day 5 again starting over. .Started to read this naked mind to help my mind to focus. .I Repeat over and over again all day long why I need to quit (my health is getting threatened weight loss energy etc). But when the night comes it gets difficult. .It's friday so it's one of the most difficult days for me. .IWNDWYT.

IWNDWYT Fridays are the hardest for me too but I do like a Saturday morning without regrets! 
Welcome back! I'm here after relapse too. It's tough coming back. I felt pretty ashamed and hopeless. The reality is that if I stewed in those feelings I'd be back to drinking again. Can't say I feel great right now but every day is a little better. We can get through this Friday sober because think how wonderful we'll feel with no regrets or hangover tomorrow!
The key is to stay busy during the major times like Friday night maybe visit a friend or go to the cinema or go for a walk. I found sitting at home on a Friday was really hard but doing something until the time passed was great now I don't know how I had the time to drink
Glad you're back
