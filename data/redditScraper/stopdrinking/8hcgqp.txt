The first week was tough but then after that the first two months seemed like way more of a breeze than I had anticipated. I made the mistake of thinking this is gonna be a piece of cake. Dead. Wrong. The last week or so has been the toughest week. I feel isolated to the point of tears. I've fallen into hermit mode and I know I could make more of an effort but I find mind myself having no motivation to do so. My partner still drinks heavily and now I can't stand him when he's drunk which is just about every night. I feel like my friendships are fading. It feels like I've become a boring person and I want so badly to go out and drink and have fun but I know that's not the answer no matter how deep and strong the urge is. Everyday has become a struggle to maintain my sobriety and it's the first time I've felt scared that maybe I'm not as strong as I thought. I've read something about the  pink cloud  or something along those lines and I think mine has burst. Just hoping to make it through this dark side. ..Thankful for this space and for y'all.

Oh that sounds so tough.  I am sorry you going through this. IWNDWYT 
My 'pink cloud' evaporated abruptly at about the same point and was replaced by a distressing 'Grey Soup' phase... at the time it was easy to imagine that it would go on forever but it didn't.....Hang in there and do whatever you need to to get through it except drink!!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;.
Thank you for your share it's a good reminder to me where I'm at to not be lazy about my sobriety and to keep doing the things that got me to this point. You are a very strong person you have 72 days under your belt this too shall pass : ).
