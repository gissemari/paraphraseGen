I've been working with him for about a year now and we've grown really close. He was on vacation with his family and a girl he was seeing ordered a bottle of wine and the waiter poured him a glass. He didn't tell me for a week or two but I knew something was wrong. Im worried about him. I was shooken up earlier but I'm feeling better now. Of course I find out the day my parents are leaving town for the weekend. This is reaffirming my desire to stay sober. I have to get a new sponsor now. I kinda feel a bit lost without his guidance. I'm not sure what the point of this post is but I just needed to get this off my chest. I'm going to a meeting in a couple hours

Sounds like you are very well-grounded in your sobriety today. 
If you have been working the program with him for a year maybe you can be there for him when he is ready to get sober maybe the student can be the teacher so to speak.
