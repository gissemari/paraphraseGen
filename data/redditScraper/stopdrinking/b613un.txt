Today marks day seven. I havnt been seven days sober since sometime in 2014. It feels like I've been walking in a fog only to now remember what the sun feels like. Im not in the sun yet but I remember it. It's a continual struggle to remind myself why I'm on this path but I'm glad I started it. The headaches are still a hassle and no matter how much water I drink I'm perputaully thirsty. However the clarity of thought is a amazing. Looking back over the past years I feel like a fool and cant help regret the decisions I've made. Here is to a better future one day at a time.

Congratulations on a week! I was in that fog for many years and I'm in the sunshine now.  It's good to be free.  Keep going...you will get there! I believe in you! IWNDWYT
