Amped up to watch hockey tonight! Normally I'd be so hungover I'd feel like I had to drink to stay awake or already half tanked. Sad that I feel so great and naturally excited to watch I feel like drinking. Just took some vitamins amino acids and poured a diet 7up. I won't drink with you guys tonight go hockeys go

I'm glad you're feeling good and hope you enjoy the game! I'm pinging u/xJTowes19 - he's got a passion for hockey you guys may wanna chat! :)
I won't drink with you tonight! Enjoy the hockey game! 
Sounds like a case of the "pink cloud" to me. Enjoy and I won't drink with you tonight.
The last three weeks of me trying to quit I have relapsed on day six. I felt the same way it was almost a body high and I decided just one won't hurt. 10 hours later I was being woken up by a hotel staff member because I collapsed in the hotel hallway in front of my room. Im glad to hear your fighting your craves. I will not drink with you tonight.
I understand that feeling good so I want to drink thing.Fucking crazy bullshit is what it is!I always would white knuckle it through it because I'm a dry drunk and I have no other good coping skills...Go Sports!
