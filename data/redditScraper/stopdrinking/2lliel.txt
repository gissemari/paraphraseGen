I've been sober on and off for about a year and a half mostly sober but with a few month or two relapses in between. One thing I realized is that when I drink a lot I basically stop doing anything. Stop functioning at work stop doing things at home stop seeing other people. I might as well be in a coma. Sometimes I get a negative attitude about being sober but at least I'm actually alive sober instead of being hooked on a vodka drip in a dark room somewhere.

I hear ya man.  I am a "Dark Room" kind of drunk too.  Sober is better even if it is not always awesome.
Yes it's brighter out here in sobriety.
I noticed that my drinking at night even killed my productivity the following work day when I was completely sober.  It's like it just zapped my motivational drive.  That is probably it's more dire consequences on me so far.  Fall away from friends bad work ethic stopped working out and running.  Just a ton of nothing!
