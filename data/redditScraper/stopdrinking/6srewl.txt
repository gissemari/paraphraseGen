Don't worry I'll make the explanation short!..I'm a 25 year old male. I was never much of a drinker. I'd have maybe 3 drinks a week up until last year sometime. Now I'm at about 5-10 shots a day. Sometimes more sometimes less. But it's every day. I can't do it anymore. I could kill a half a fifth of vodka a day if I really tried. I haven't but I'm sure I could and I never want to see that day. I'm tired of being afraid of getting close to that point. I'm done. .And I'm done now. (Technically about 7 hours ago but you get the point). I have a heart condition that lowers my life expectancy. So why would I continue to drink and make it worse?! So everyone out there. I'm not drinking with you! ..Also I know I dont (well didn't) drink as much as a lot of people here. But I do have tons of respect for everyone in the struggle. Anyone out there who needs someone to talk to or anything I'm here phones always on!
