I need to check in to be accountable.  Having a bit of a struggle at the moment.  I need to keep remembering why I am doing this.  We have fostered a dog for a week a beautiful greyhound that is keeping me company at night.  I am struggling with being lonely.  I miss having someone to talk to other then a 5 year old and 2 year old!  Anyway just a check in to keep me going as I really have no one else to be accountable to.  Thanks for the support.

I will not drink with you today! ..I love greyhounds. I had one for 7 years. His name was Fly. They are such sweet dogs. ..Enjoy your children and the grey.
