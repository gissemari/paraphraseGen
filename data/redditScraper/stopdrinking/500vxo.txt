I drank again last night and I feel like an ass. I had a headache that wouldn't go away so let's drown it in booze right? So since I can't figure out why I have had a headache for like a week I finally got some relief from being drunk. My sinuses hurt like hell and my head hurts so much I feel sick. And that's not a hangover headache either. ..Anyway I don't know how to stop focusing on the fact that I've only drank twice in basically two months. All I can focus on is that I screwed up and now I'm spiraling. I don't have those 7 weeks alcohol free to be proud of and kind of help keep me from caving...It all just seems so pointless. People say it gets better but does it really? Things may be OK for a bit but then they just get shitty again.

I guess I try to remember I'm not competing with anyone but myself here - and it's not even a competition but my life we're talking about. I've reset my badge more times than I can count but I am willing to show up time and time again to try and stop. I am hoping this will be the time that sticks. And that's what keeps me from giving up all hope. Hang in there! 7 weeks alcohol-free means you can and will do it again. :)
I do the [Baby Steps. That's how I came back after 7 years in relapse.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)
Staying sober solves a lot of problems. However I didn't know how to do it without therapy treatment and AA. I was desperate and wanted help. Do you?
&gt;People say it gets better but does it really? ..When I got to the point of wanting to live as a sober person then there was a point. Stopping drinking wasn't the point--I'd done that many times. Live sober to me meant leaving behind the self-inflicted misery of drinking--hangovers fights depression low performance unkept commitments failed marriage declining physical health. Maybe you can make your own list of how drinking impacts you or will. Then another list of how living without alcohol changes things. Compare. What's consistent with your goals?..Stopping drinking didn't solve all of life's problems for me. Some things got better and many things still sucked. The difference was that by not drinking I could actually work on and work through the things that sucked over time. That's how those things got better. ..So for me the formula was: 1) Stop drinking; 2) Work on the real problems; 3) *time* 4) Profit (which I think of as sobriety). 
Well what do you want?
it really does get better.
