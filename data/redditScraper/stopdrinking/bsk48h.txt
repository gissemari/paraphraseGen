Hi everyone!..I had a drunk customer come into my job yesterday. I work in the service department of a car dealership. I've had a couple of people come in with interlock breathalyzer devices in their car. I once got dry-heaves from moving a car with dried puke all over the parking brake. It wasn't an emergency they were just in for an oil change. I couldn't say for certain but as an alcoholic I'd say that seems pretty alcoholic to me. I've had a couple of clearly stoned customers and it's not uncommon for a car to come in reeking of weed so strongly that the service bay smells like a Phish concert from rolling the windows down. But this was my first obviously drunk customer...She was chewing gum she smelled like beer and mint. She wasn't slurring but I wasn't too sure how much she understood of what I said the conversation was pretty circular. She dropped the car off for service and her son picked her up. ..She called an hour later and full on screamed at me about how long the service appointment was taking until her son took the phone away from her and arranged to come in and pick the car up. ..I felt bad for him. I wasn't too bothered by her. I just held the phone away from my ear. I've been drunk enough myself to know that there's no getting through to someone in that state. And oddly even though she was the most abusive customer I've had so far it bothered me a lot less than my other angry customers. Maybe because I understood that it wasn't personal in any way maybe because it was a state of mind that I could identify with. I don't know...She called again a half hour or so later. Her son was gone she was home alone. She was more disoriented she said she'd been asleep for a couple of hours. I wasn't in the habit of calling people when I was in that state but I've definitely been there - drinking passing out drinking again. She kept calling me  sweetheart.  I assured her that her son was picking the car up and that she didn't need to worry about anything. ..And that was it. He got the car. Again I felt bad for him but it's not my business. I'm glad that I didn't have to deal with a drunk customer picking a car up I'm not sure what I would do in that situation. I have a friend in AA who works in the industry I will ask him how I should handle it if that should happen. Because I definitely wouldn't feel comfortable giving car keys to someone who was impaired but I don't know if I have the authority to deny someone their car and I can't see myself calling the cops on someone driving drunk. Not that there's anything wrong with doing that and it's probably the right thing to do I just can't see myself doing it. I identify with drunks too much...I debated whether I should tell this story on here. I couldn't think of how to talk about it without saying something about what my job is. I've been on SD for more than four years now under this same account name. I've shared a lot of personal experiences and I've given away a lot of identifying information. If someone wanted to go through all of my old posts and use all of this to harm me in some way I'm sure they could. If someone who I knew in real life happened upon my posts and started reading them I'm sure they'd be able to identify me. And talking about my job gives away another point of information...But I don't know how much I've ever gotten from hiding things. Everything that I've written on here is true or at least it was true from my perspective at the time that I wrote it. I can't be hurt by who I am. And I can't get the help or support that I need to live a good and happy life if I hide. ..I'm not ashamed of being an alcoholic anymore. I don't go out of my way to talk about it but if the world at large knew every detail about my alcoholism I don't know if it would really matter. It's not exactly like I'm going to be running for president. It is a part of me but it's not who I am. And being honest about my experiences is how I get help help others and grow as a person. ..The only reason that I am able to say today that I know that it is possible to get sober and find recovery from addiction is because I struggled so hard with my addiction before I got to where I am. If quitting drinking and building a sober life had been easy for me if my problem hadn't really been that bad if my life hadn't gotten out of control I wouldn't be able to say with any conviction that I know that it is possible to be an alcoholic and to get sober. But I know that from my own experience. I am an alcoholic. I've been through some shit. I got sober. My life is better now. Those things are all true. They're true for me. I've seen that they are true for other people. They can also be true for you...I know now that I don't have to be perfect to be a worthwhile person. I know now that it's okay to make mistakes and that I can recover from them and that I am still a worthwhile person who is worthy of love. No one can point at my mistakes and tell me the opposite because my mistakes are my proof. I am still the person who I was when I was totally fucked up. I wasn't any less of a person then than I am now. I'm happier with how I live my life now but I'm not ashamed of who I was before. I suffered. I caused suffering. I needed help. I was worthy of love and help and recovery then I am worthy of love and help and recovery now...Which is I guess why my drunk customer didn't bother me. I noticed her for sure probably more than my coworkers would have but I know that she's a person who is suffering. She is worthy of love and respect. It is not my place to save people but it's also not my place to punish them. My job is to just try not to cause harm to my fellow humans and help where I can. ..I'm an alcoholic. I'm uniquely qualified to give back to other alcoholics because this is where my experiences are the most relevant. I'd rather speak freely in the hopes that maybe it could be helpful to someone else than hide who I am in fear that people might find out my big dark secret that I fucked up some stuff and I'm not perfect. Which I did and I'm not and I've lived to tell the tale...Anyway I hope that you all are well. And at the end of the day I am just one small voice among many. Thank you all for being here it is only by doing this with others that I've been able to get and stay sober. ..Ginger_Sprout Out

I'd only call the cops on someone in that situation as a last resort too. Like try to get someone else to take them home first. I feel really sorry for drunks too. I know how easy it is to become ne
Hey Ginger happy 300+ days! ..I agree - definitely talk to your friend in the industry. ..I would also recognize how you interacted with her differently than how many others may have. You did not increase her suffering. You did not yell guilt shame demean or do any of those things to increase her suffering. You did not give her another reason to drink. ..At the same time you did not give her the power to guilt or shame you into drinking. You didn't take her home with you beyond the opportunity to reflect. ..You underestimate your own healing and you compassion for others. ..Take good care
