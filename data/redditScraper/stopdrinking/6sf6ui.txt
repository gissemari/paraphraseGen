I'm two days sober and still withdrawing bad. I have the shakes my head hurts I'm sweating like crazy...I've missed so much work I'm afraid I'll lose my job and with that my home. I need to make it stick this time I can't keep relapsing...When will the withdrawal end?..I'm going through hell!

Hang in there buddy. It does get better and it is so worth it. We are here for you if you need us.
If you're going through Hell keep going! ..Please be safe. I was in a pretty serious spot and wound up hospitalized on Day 3. Once you get passed this you never have to go through it again. I won't drink with you! 
Hi I'm on day 5 and really do feel more free from all that poison now. Hang in there. Day 2 is the worst from now on it gets easier... stick with it drink sugary drinks!!!
