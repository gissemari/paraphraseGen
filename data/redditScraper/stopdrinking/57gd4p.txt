And today just seemed easier. It's only day six but day four was a struggle and I pushed through. After six years of not having a week go by without at LEAST two to three heavy drinking days I woke up this morning and realized that I had slept through a whole night undisturbed. I reached over to my nightstand to grab my water and take a sip. ..I realized that on a "normal" night I would have tossed and turned hour after hour and chugged my water at 2 AM when I awoke dehydrated with my tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth. Those little awful things being absent from my life for even this short of a time feels amazing. My energy and mood are already improving. This is so worth it...Happy Friday! Not drinking today - gotta make it to my first full week!

Only Day 6?? Don't diminish that accomplishment that is awesome!!..I'm proud of you!..I will not drink with you today!
Isn't it amazing how icky the aftermath is yet we kept going back to it?..Nice work.
Congrats on 6 days friend! Your motivation is inspiring. I have also realised the difference in the morning sip rather than the two pints of water through the night haha! .Not drinking with you today! Lets make it our first week!! 
One day at a time . I'm on day one again. It can be done.
Great work!  From my experience those first few dry Fridays were the toughest.  But it feels so great to wake up Saturday morning with energy!
