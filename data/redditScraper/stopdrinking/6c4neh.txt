Hello All  .  .  As the title indicates I (25M) have been off the sauce for just over six months now. It hasn't been easy but I've enjoyed the benefits seen in these (removed). Here is what I have experienced: ..* **Weight Loss** 180 lbs to 150 lbs.* **Systolic BP** of 155mmHg to 130 mmHg (no longer hypertension).* **Better skin** and better hair from my new found discipline .* **Courage** to see a counselor and talk my way through problems.* **Confidence** boost which is something I have struggled in the past..* **Promotion** at work ahead of the curve  .  .  .  I am younger than a lot of the posters here but I was starting to enter dangerous territory. My problem was always the relentless binge drinking and the professional level benders I could go on. When I got stressed at work I had the hardest time sleeping through the night from my anxiety.  .  Alcohol was a great solution at first because it could take the edge off. The problem is it totally depressed me and would make me come into work feeling wiped out from the night before. This caused me to get more anxious about my workload and want to consume more booze when I got home. Vicious cycle! There was a three day period when I did nearly nothing but eat delivery food and drink more alcohol to escape. This is when I knew I needed to turn my life around- enough was enough. I took to /sd and read "The Naked Mind" just over 6 months ago and couldn't have asked for more. I don't like to brag in real life but I am really proud of myself and wanted to share my pride with someone so I hope you don't mind.  .  .  Forgot to mention the Invisalign that I got around the same time I started my sobriety. Being booze free did not straighten my wonky teeth.  .  .  Thank you guys for the tremendous support!

Way to go man! 
Congratulations!!!!! 
Good job man! It's great that you realized you had a problem this young.  Now you don't have to waste your entire 20s on booze!
congratulations! 
Awesome
congratulations! just a heads up. a few months ago some online publications were taking pics off this sub and embedding them into stories about alcoholics who quit drinking. they were inspiring stories yes but pictures were being used without permission. so you could end up all over the internets.
Congrats on 6 months! Glad you're enjoying the amazing benefits of sobriety!
You look amazing and happy! Way to go!
Genuine smile in second pic. Congrats! 
What you describe about work and drinking being a cycle is exactly what I'm struggling with. Kudos for breaking free. 
Awesome job and great teeth! My husband got Invisalign and there is no way drunk me would've taken care of it consistently. So maybe that's another bonus experience. :D
Damn dude you look great! It's amazing how different you look in the face after losing that 30 lbs...As a young guy myself who just quit two weeks ago this is really inspiring. Thanks for that and good luck with your continued sobriety!
Great job! Way to turn things around especially at a young age. ..I won't drink with you today!
Great job breaking that vicious cycle. I was there too.  Congratulations on all that your new found sobriety has brought you. Enjoy and have a great summer. 
I'm starting my Invisalign next week! Hope my before and after pics looks as awesome as yours :D Looking good!
Was the weight loss just from not drinking or did you diet/exercise?
Congratulations!   You look happier in the second picture.   Good stuff.  
Damn dude looking good!!!  Great work. It's wonderful when all the efforts shine from the inside out.  
Your skin is glowing!
congrats! It's really nice to see fellow younger people here (I'm also 25)/inspo to not give up and keep not drinking! you look great btw. 
Brilliant. What an improvement!
Arranged marriages on the other hand per definition must be based on mutual respect and in a sense have that built in from the start.
awwww you are adorable...Congrats on six months and your gains.!!
