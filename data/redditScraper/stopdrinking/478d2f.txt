I relapsed. Back in the hospital with a million things wrong with me. *sigh*

Damn. ..Sounds like what you've been doing isn't getting you the results you want...Time for change?
Hope you get to feeling better soon
When I was in the hospital I felt like a) I was being taken care of b) I was safe in case I went into withdrawal and c) I could not drink. I used it as a detox so that when I got out I already had the first seven days under my belt. Hope you're better soon.
Sorry.. Feel better soon 
What further steps can you take that you have not so far that might keep you sober?
