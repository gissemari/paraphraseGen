This thought has been bouncing around my head for the past week and it worries me. I keep hearing things like "relapse is a normal part of recovery" and "it's ok to fall down just get up and try again" etc. ..And I start thinking that I'm allowed a slip. That I'm *entitled* to a slip. And that I should do it now while I only have one month of sobriety to ruin and not several years. It's stupid. ..I'm not going to drink today but fuck I'm really thinking about it. I'm already half-consciously planning the details.

I am not allowed to relapse. It is not going to be a part of my story. I refuse to allow it to happen even once....I know how my brain works and I know that as soon as it figures out relapse is an option it will keep going back there over and over. So for me: no option. You can do this without relapse. I am proof. There are many of us.
That is the booze brain talking. I try to externalize those thoughts as if they were a stranger talking to me. An evil stranger. "I am entitled" is booze brain. I try to go occupy myself with something else. Eat sleep exercise anything but a drink. .Stay strong. It is tough. I will not drink with you tonight.
Relapse is not a necessary part of recovery. It is definitely not part of mine. Alcohol is never an option for me. This is what keeps me safe. Making it back after a relapse is not guaranteed. Many don't. I am "entitled" to my sober happy life; I am also proof that this life is possible without relapse.  
were it me I'd funnel that destructive desire into a more harmless venue. Part of me clearly wants to just say 'fuck itttt' and if I couldn't convince it not to I'd say 'lets have some cookies then. cookies and milk. you can have as many as you like." and that'd sort of satisfy that destructive behavior in a more harmless manner. Long run not a great solution..cookies aren't that healthy for you but it beats the shit out of booze.
That's your diseased brain talking.  Don't listen to it it hasn't worked for you so far.  You are entitled to sobriety and a happy joyous and free life.
If I relapse  there is a really good chance I will never make it back to where I am now.
I relapsed. I felt like enough time had past that honestly I had changed. Sadly it doesn't work that way and all it led to was a good month of heart ache and pain.  relapse isn't part of it but they happen and we can't beat our selves up over it. Just know your better off Not having one because if your here then you already know the end result. The stove is hot don't touch it. 
I'm not allowed a relapse. Period...&gt;I keep hearing things like "relapse is a normal part of recovery" and "it's ok to fall down just get up and try again" etc...This is a great example of why we all need to follow the "speak from the I" rule. Relapse is absolutely not part of everyone's story.
I have some similar thoughts knocking around. Mine sounds more like "if you don't relapse then you're not really an alcoholic." I push it back by reminding myself that right now I have a few great people reaching out to help me and they may not be there if I go out and then come back in a few months or years. This may be my best chance.
Allowed by whom?.A lot of my self destructive tendencies are motivated by this drive that you're describing.  "I can drink all day if I want" "I'm an adult I can eat as many cookies as I want" "I know I'll regret it if I drink this whole pot of coffee but I'm going to do it anyway because f* it."  Even though I know that I am only punishing myself (seriously no one cares if I ingest enough caffeine to give me heart palpitations) I have this need to do it anyway and drinking was for me the most effective way to do it.  The turning point for me which I've been able to wrap my head around for alcohol but not yet for any of my other vices is that I don't actually want to drink because it's me who doesn't want the consequences.  Stopping and cutting down because I thought I should or because I felt an outside pressure to do so never worked and I failed at it for over a decade because screw those people.  I am entitled to a drink and I can drink as much as I want to.  But I don't want to because I know what it brings. ..Now if I can only figure out how to make a similar change in perspective around food and exercise...
I may or may not be "allowed" a relapse however I'm *really* not sure I'm going to be allowed another recovery. So I choose to keep the one I have just in case.
Your inner addict is strong...Posting here is good - what other tools are you using?
Total abstinence and harm reduction are very difficult concepts to hold in your mind together.  I operate as if I am not going to relapse EVER.  Relapsing could kill me.  Relapse is work as well so either way you're making a choice to do hard work.  I'm lazy and it feels like less work NOT to relapse and go through all the guilt shame suicidality drama and withdrawals to get back to a place where sobriety seems worth it again.  ..You deserve to make good on your progress so far.  You deserve to not put yourself through that...My last relapse took me out for two years.  Eating up all these years is not worth it for me.  Might it happen again?  Yep.  Will I do everything in my power to stop it?  Absolutely.
What helps me is telling myself that "it's easier to stay stopped than it is to stop". ..Relapse was part of my recovery and it fucking sucked. It was supposed to be a "just tonight and tomorrow I'll start sobriety over" thing. I found myself unable to start over again until I spent an absolutely miserable 10 months trying to get sober and failing and ultimately had to check myself into rehab to get to where I am today. ..So I know firsthand how dangerous the lie is that you can always start stopping again tomorrow is. And I know how miserable it is to have a head full of sobriety and a belly full of booze to desperately and sincerely wanting to stop again but not being able to. So now for me drinking is NEVER an option. I know now that I can always drink again but I honestly don't know if I'll be able to get sober again. 
Thanks for this.  My SO and I went to our favorite pizza place last night and I stared at all these bottles of wine I would have drunk in the past.  I said to him.  Let's have a glass and he said we can talk about it consider it but we're not going to do it spur of the  moment.  He was right because talking about it would remind me how good I feel now not drinking how much I have gained.  But boy I had the craving last night.  so thanks very much for posting this and opening up this conversation.
I find that if I'm half-consciously planning a relapse I will have a relapse if I don't stop it in its tracks. I find it helps to imagine that I really did relapse and then look at the pros/cons of having done so. Then I look at the pros/cons of not having done so...Eg. **Pros of relapsing (all these are speculative mind you):**..-Had fun..**Cons of relapsing:**..-Big hangover..-Caught back in the destructive cycle of drinking..-Family/friends don't trust me..**Pros of not relapsing:**..-Self-pride..-Continuing to break the destructive cycle of addiction..-Feeling healthy no shitty hangover..**Cons of not relapsing:**..-Could've had fun (maybe)...That's just how I think about it and I'm not out of the woods (the above exercise is helping me thru similar thoughts :) I'm really looking forward to putting together some real sober time so I can experience the highs and lows and creamy middles of a year without drinking. I find it stressful to think of sober time as a precarious tower that can fall and I think it's goofy to collect days sober just to collect days sober but years are measured in days... So I want to keep on going...
I've had enough drinks in my day I don't need another to remind me how much I can embarrass/hate myself. Sure I could relapse. There are also a number of things I could do in this world that I don't want to. Relapse is pretty far up on the list. I don't need to break my own leg just to know that I don't want to do it. I'm trying to remember that drinking is the same way. Am I entitled to it? Is it actually a reward to wake up hungover trying to piece together what all I fucked up in my life the night before? I COULD do it but I don't want to. 
Oh wow this sounds all too familiar. I have to consciously override addict voice with wise mind with the message : relapse could kill me. It also gets harder and harder to stay sober every time I relapse so for me it's no longer an option. Sending you strength you got this.
