On my 12th day sober here and I'm feeling pretty good. The only thing I'm still struggling with is sleeping. The first 5 days or so I was barely sleeping at all. Within the past week I've been sleeping but my schedule is very terrible. I've been going to sleep anywhere between 5-10am and sleeping until the early afternoon. It's now 5:30am here and I've decided enough is enough I'm going to power through it and stay up all day and go to bed early tonight and reset my sleep schedule. It's kind of  funny  in a way because when I would drink I could stay up for extended periods of time no problem on an alcohol fuelled binge. Yet now it seems like such a hard accomplishment to achieve while sober. I'm just going to try and keep busy and not give into the temptation of having a nap. Hope everyone has a great day IWNDWYT!

Good for you!  I also have struggled with the sleeping.  I am trying to exercise everyday to make myself tired and it is helping (a little).  IWNDWYT
I do exercise during the day then reading 10mg of Melatonin and Sleepytime tea at night and it really helps. Best of luck to you and IWNDWYT!
I'm literally in the same boat as you right now. Day 15 stayed up all night since I have the day off today. It's 11 am and I want to take a nap. ..Good luck! IWNDWYT
