From my experience and from talking to friends on and offline I've attempted to gently summarise the withdrawal symptoms and give somewhat of a guide to the alcohol recovery timeline. ..&amp;#x200B;..I'm hoping this is a catalyst for some people to 1) prevent a relapse and 2) to make that crucial step towards sobriety. Support is out there and we should be proud of being sober. ..&amp;#x200B;..[https://optimiseyourself.com/alcohol/alcohol-withdrawal-recovery-timeline](https://optimiseyourself.com/alcohol/alcohol-withdrawal-recovery-timeline)
