I realize two months may be a more appropriate milestone marker but I'm super excited for 50 & couldn't help but post! I'm at the end of my first week of classes for this spring semester and even managed a what once could have been upsetting call from someone in my past today unscathed. ..I'm very thankful to this sub & all who post time and time again! I know that in my past attempts at sobriety this would be the time period where I'd begin thinking "but just one beer a Guinness the calories won't offset my whole day!" (as if calories were the least of my worries when I drank!) But again just wanted to thank everyone who participates here. In the past too I would by this point think I'm "cured" or "can handle myself" around alcohol but with the help of this sub I know I have a longer harder but more rewarding struggle ahead of me.
