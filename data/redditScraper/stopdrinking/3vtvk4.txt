I've been clean for 2 days and don't want to go back. But I also don't want to go outside and talk to people about this. I can do it anonymously here and I thank you guys for that. I'm trying to work up the courage to go to my first meeting tonight. I know I need to get better. Living in a major city I'm worried about it being me and a bunch of homeless people. And what do I even say?..And I can't stop the nagging in my head saying that I've have 2 great days and maybe if I just have a small bottle of wine or a couple airplane shooters tonight that's not a full relapse (although I've been here before and it's always a full relapse so I don't know how any part of my brain can think that). ..It would be so much easier to drink and I can't stop thinking about that. Easier for now at least I know it is destroying my life and I need to stop. I've spent most of the past week going through withdraw. Sweating shaking vomiting. Laying awake for hours knowing that a drink would put me back to sleep. All that fun stuff. Two days ago I hit the point where all the alcohol would finally be out of my system. I don't want to start the process over but watching a movie and drinking some wine is all I really want to do...I might not make the meeting tonight and if not will try again tomorrow but hopefully you guys see this and it will keep me sober for the night. Thanks for reading sorry if the writing is a little disjointed. ..Edit: Apologies to the homeless I wasn't meaning to single them out they were just part of my concern. I don't mean people down on their luck I mean the hostile people who sit on my block and aggressively harass people. Not sure if you've been to philly but they can be very hostile. The reason I mentioned them is because if I go to a group I don't want to feel like the odd man out and I used them as an example. If it's all high powered doctors and lawyers I'd feel the same. I'm poor myself and could easily drink myself into homelessness if I don't stop that's a big part of my concerns I wasn't trying to say that it couldn't easily be me and I didn't mean to offend. It's just out of character enough already for me to get out and do something like AA and I'm anxious about it. I mean this is the first time I've talked this in depth about my alcoholism and I immediately stuck my foot in my mouth. ..On a brighter note it's almost 8 and I haven't gone to the liquor store. I think I'm going to be alright tonight. Thanks everyone for their words and advice it helped a lot.

I don't remember sharing the [Baby Steps post with you](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) /u/AeAeR -- so now I have.  And here's [link to the post to the AA meeting how-to](https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/2v573a/the_where_why_and_what_should_i_expect_at_my/) that I wrote.  I hope you give it a shot.  Seriously don't be nervous--the rooms are filled with people just like us and we promise to be kind and respectful of you.  
I live in a major city.  I'm married 3 kids and a managing partner in a lawfirm of over 400 attorneys. I could be at your next AA meeting.  Feel free to say hi....   ..**edit:** of course I will likely be sitting next to the homeless people you are afraid of.  I tend to learn the most from them. .

I went to a meeting for the first time today and there WERE homeless people there.  And at first I DID feel judgy and out of place.  But then I listened to these people bare their souls and accepted the fact that we are all human beings affected by this disease and we were all there because we wanted to be better.  Alcoholism doesn't discriminate.  Give it a go.  If I were to say I was going to have a little wine and watch a movie I would end up passed out on the couch until the wee hours of the morning when I would finally come to shove aspirin down my throat and go to bed and wake up hungover.  Not a pretty picture.
Congrats on 2 days!  I now how hard they are and I'm joining you in not drinking today. 
Any of us could end up homeless if we carried on boozing good luck.
I got very very close to being homeless only a couple of months ago. ..It was fucking terrifying. And yeah my drinking got me there...When you reach that point you realize the guy who uses a newspaper as a blanket isn't that different from the guy who's sitting indoors.
I'm on day three keep going. 
I have sat outside of so many meetings because I was scared to go inside. It's normal for most of us to have that social anxiety. My guess is that you will probably feel some sense of relief once you actually go in. And if you don't want to say anything you don't have to. If it's a tag meeting just say I pass or I'd rather just listen tonight. (Don't let this scare you I've only been to one tag meeting and it was only because it was a small group of familiar faces) either way good luck!
