The loss of a loved one is immeasurable pain. Be the adult for your kids. It's rough but you can do it. 
Grief is tough during sobriety. Reach out for help. Attend a meeting if you can. Stay strong friend. You can do this.
Same! My ex mother-in-law is dying. I hear you loud and clear. Hang in there.
