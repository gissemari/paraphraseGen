Just wanted to give some positive feedback to those wanting to quit drinking...I wanted to do this before I headed out for work so it will have to be short...I have been on a 4-year-long binge where my longest stretch of sobriety was about 4 days. I drank every night like it was the the weekend and every weekend like it was New Years Eve...After my most recent blackout where I told my 7-month pregnant wife that I was clinically depressed and that I'm not ready to become a father I decided that it was time for a break...Well here we are Day 4...Not to say that it was easy it's been a struggle. I want to drink every night but I keep reminding myself about being a slobbering mess in front of my disappointed wife...Quick Tips:..Water - lots of it..Ice Cream - yes this really does help..Sleep - as much as you can get..Food - Eat! The first time I've had an appetite in quite a while...I would like to thank everyone here for providing motivation even while I have just been lurking...Edit: I just made day 6. This is a first in 5 years!

Don't forget your daily multi-vitamin get some exercise and also have some fun daily.  Getting in contact/being around other people in recovery is beneficial too.  Maybe give AA an honest shot!..It wasn't until my 3rd try at 4 days that I finally stayed sober.
Good luck! .It sounds like you have a great reason to stop.  Focus on the baby's room: paint build prep.  Anything to fill you time.  ..You can do this.
Hang in there because it's very much worth it.  And don't get discouraged if you wake up and don't feel like farting sunshine real life is a challenge that takes getting used to.  But come time you'll be feeling healthy and clear-headed and it will all make sense again.
