So I did relapse again after about a week sober which seems to be when I start to lose focus but now I am back on day four and something just feels different this time. ..Ill try to keep it short and sweet but I really believe if you stay persistent try not to feel sorry for yourself and don't let failures get you down you will make it out of this mess. This time around I truly just don't feel like drinking anymore. Sure it feels like something is missing and I am bored a lot but there are no strong urges to fill that void with booze. I am finally sick and tired of being sick and tired. ..I know I am not out of the water yet but I can not see myself going back to alcohol. I've failed a lot but to my credit I have stayed focused and not given up because of those failures. I'll try to keep checking in but the gist of what I'm trying to say is DON'T GIVE UP and keep the big picture in mind!

Great post! Thanks for sharing. I also found that I felt different about drinking in a good way when I did something different after relapsing. When I added to my sobriety plan.

I can't count the times I've given up drinking. You know what's different this time? I'm posting every day in the daily check in...I make a commitment. Part of who I am is a person who honors commitments. If I am to grow into the person I wish to become I must be true to myself.
