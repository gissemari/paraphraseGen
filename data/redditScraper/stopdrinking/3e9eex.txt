I have had 3+ years of sobriety in the past that had good and bad points. I relapsed a few years ago - slowly increasing back to an unmanageable life again. I stopped for a few months a couple of years ago but eventually started again...I am embarrassed to be an alcoholic but I want to stop drinking alcohol again...A few in my circle know I stopped probably know I picked up again. A few others know I am an alcoholic and should stop. Others still probably don't believe I have a problem...I am considering outing myself to a lot of people as a mechanism of a bunch of accountability people in my life. I am afraid my dynamic will change with some some won't care some will be glad and relieved...Collectively is that a good idea a bad/terrible idea? I sort of feel bad about it in that I am putting my burden out so openly to people that might not understand or care. I could use the constant interaction with these people as a way to remind myself that I shouldn't drink which is apparently something I need - nothing like guilt to keep one sober right?..Suggestions and input would be welcomed.

Absolutely it's a good idea to tell some people in your life about your alcoholism. I found for myself that I chose to not tell people so I could continue drinking with as little consequence as possible. The more people you tell the more support you have and the harder it gets to drink. And if you're serious about your recovery that is a good thing.
I got a lot more benefit by outing myself to a bunch of sober alcoholics. They had the experience I needed and stability I wanted. Once I was sober for a while I stopped being embarrassed and actually became grateful to be an alcoholic. My disease forced me to take a spiritual journey that I wouldn't give up for all the booze in the world. I share these facts with different people at different times depending on the situation and the degree of intimacy in our relationship.
