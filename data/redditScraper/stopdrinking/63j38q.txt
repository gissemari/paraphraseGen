So I am starting out again on trying to quit drinking. I have pretty bad anxiety that is only exacerbated by alcohol and I know quitting would settle my mind a lot but I always seem to relapse. My doctor prescribed me a drug that makes you feel ill when you drink . Has anyone else tried this? I don't have the drug yet so I don't remember the name.

It's called Antabuse. I've heard good things about it when used in conjunction with other supports and treatments. ..I treated every aspect of my addiction: the biological side the social side the psychological component and the spiritual component.
