Badge reset request submitted. ..I relapsed. Hard. I endured some huge changes in my life that left me reeling. ..I'm in the ER. Not feeling well. My face is so puffy and ugly. I'm on an IV drip. I blacked out in front of my family last night. Cried. Vomited. ..I need to be better. I need to be the best person I can be. Alcohol has no place in the life I want. So I'm starting over...Day 1. I will not drink today.
