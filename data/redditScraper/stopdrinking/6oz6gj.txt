Hey I've posted here before but mostly I lurk..Last month I thought to myself "hey I've been sober for a few months now I'm not an alcoholic anymore! I deserve a drink." So I had one drink that night. Then I had two the next. Then I had ten the night after that..So I'm sober as of this morning. I feel like shit. How do all you people deal?
