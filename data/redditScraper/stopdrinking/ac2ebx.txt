First time post long time reader. I struggle to admit that I might have an issue but looking back over the last year is like looking through a frosted window. You can make out vague shapes and colours but most of it is too hard to make out. I'm at about a bottle of wine a day but almost always more....with a multitude of excuses to back up why it's actually only been a glass. I'm ashamed. ..I've done it to kill anxiety and stress and I'm turn just as I've read 1000s of times before it's made it so much more difficult to manage. ..I'm tired of waking up feeling like a truck has ran over me and I'm tired of having that vague alcohol vapour in the back of my mouth in the first few hours of the morning. I'm tired of arguing in my own head on how I can live like this just because I start to feel normal by late afternoon. ..I've always been a healthy and active personuntil a few years ago. I've slowed down put on some weight started to live with remorse  somewhat about life just streaming while I watch it in a fog instead of actually participate in it. ..My own internal chatter always has seemed to convince me that I can stop at any time. Nows that time. ..Dry January is step one to either bringing it under control or perhaps to continue on being dry for the rest of my life. Who knows but one way or another IWNDWYT. ..Oh and I've just discovered that at just before bed ... nothing and I mean nothing (ok maybe sex..) is better than an cold glass of water. I did not realize how thirsty this body of mine has been.
