I'm staying strong taking one day at a time. Was so surprised most of my group gave in over the weekend.

Good for You !!   You're putting it together one 24 hours at a time.  It gets easier!
Out of curiosity how big was the group?
I'll be part of your group bro.
Stay strong!  I won't drink with you today.
