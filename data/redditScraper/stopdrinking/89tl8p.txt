I'm sorry for the length of this post! I don't expect anyone to read/comment but I feel like I need to get this out somewhere (and if you do make it through the whole thing you are a saint or really bored :p)...Day one again. I feel like I'm living a really shitty version of Groundhog day where I wake up violently nauseous with a raging headache shaky ashamed angry at myself and resolving that I am not going to do this again... fast forward 24-36 hours... violently nauseous with a raging headache ... fast forward .... violently nauseous ... fast forward .... ..To avoid repeating this until my poor abused body finally phones it in I am trying to come up with ways to make it different this time. What can I change to make this work?!..1) Accountability - I have stopped telling my SO that I am quitting drinking due to the fact that I inevitably fail which is embarrassing and makes me look like a liar. But I need his understanding/support in this because otherwise he is a bit of an enabler. I have also recently started seeing a therapist who is lovely and has been at least somewhat helpful... but I don't want to admit to her how hard I am struggling with alcohol abuse. She knows some  but really since this is a huge part of my issues I don't know how I expect her to help if I'm not honest. I guess I'm afraid she'll stop seeing me because the last time I went to a counselor and admitted the scope of my problem she referred me to another place that specialized in addiction who didn't have openings for two months and I never ended up seeing anyone. I need to let go of my pride and fear.  Even if she sends me away I live in a big city now so I can find someone willing to help me...2) Support/likeminded people - while I did achieve a several month stretch of sobriety a couple of years ago with the help of AA I had some issues with the program and (more importantly) am now in a career where I can't risk being "found out" as someone who struggles with alcohol. I am afraid going to AA here would result in the latter. I signed up for SMART recovery ages ago during one of my many "I'm quitting" moments and have poked around on the site a little. The interface is not user friendly but I'm sure with more time I'll understand it better. This time around I am resolving to use that site daily as well as check in here daily and use the IRC chat when I'm having cravings...3) Getting the alcohol out of sight - I wish I could have no alcohol at all in the house but that is asking a lot of my SO as he is a normal drinker who enjoys a nightcap. I've gone so far as to think I should lock it up and give him the key! I don't have a good answer to this one yet although maybe I can just teach myself to become nauseous at the look/smell of alcohol (pretty much there right now already). I am also going to avoid bars and parties for the foreseeable future because I always end up drinking if I'm surrounded by others drinking...4) Planning for cravings - when I'm this hungover I can never imagine wanting to drink again so when the urge hits me later I am not really prepared. This time I am going to plan. What am I going to do when I want a drink? Answer -- ask myself am I thirsty hungry bored or tired and work on fixing that. I recently got my guitar out and re-strung it I can practice when I'm bored. Or draw when I'm bored. Or make cookies. Or take the dog for a walk. Or watch TV. I need to get better at keeping food around I loathe grocery stores and avoid shopping until I am literally snacking on croutons straight from the bag like a savage. Sometimes I will drink to forget I'm hungry. ..5) Changing patterns - my main trigger/time that I drink is after I get home from work. I work until late (~11 PM) and my SO is already asleep by the time I get home. I can't go straight to sleep I always am too wound up from work so I fell into the habit of sitting up reading &amp; drinking in the living room. It wouldn't be an issue if I did that for 30 minutes before bed but being an alcoholic I end up drinking 5-6 or more drinks and staying up until 3 AM then waking up hungover AF and wishing for death. I need to make a new habit. Maybe come home and meditate or listen to one episode of a podcast or something before bed? I'm wondering if moving "my spot" would be helpful since the routine is linked to that specific chair. ...That's all I've got for now. I will not drink with you today. Have a wonderful sober day everyone &lt;3

I was probably the youngest director at a major aerospace firm working on the Space Shuttle program when I started going to AA. ..I used to drive several towns over to attend meetings because I was afraid for my career.  Over the next year I learned how many people I worked for with or worked for me attended meetings. ..NASA got much more for their money when I was going to AA meetings than when I was chairing boards controlling a $50m annual budget or signing a piece of paper that said the Space Shuttle was ready to fly while my hands were shaking.  ..I don't know anything about SMART but I can guarantee that any recovery program has a better chance of helping your career than being  hungover AF . ..Good luck
It's funny you mention moving your "spot". I had my couch in a certain corner and was used to lying down on it with a bunch of pillows at the end of the night just like you. I moved my furniture around and removed the tv from the living room so I can't just veg out like I used to. Well that's not exactly true - I bought some new chairs and a footstool so now when I relax in the evening I sit up in a chair with my feet up. If I want to watch anything it has to be on my tablet or laptop but usually I read. The mixup of furniture and relaxing position has been a helpful switch for me. Then if I am tired or just want to lie down to read I go to bed which makes my end of night/no drinking final. Little things like this can help.
