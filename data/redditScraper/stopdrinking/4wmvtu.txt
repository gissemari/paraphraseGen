I haven't posted much but I visit every day and the stories and motivations here have helped me turn my life around.  I want to thank everyone here for being a part of this awesome community.  I wanted to quit for a while before I finally did and I struggled like a lot of people with moderation (didn't work for me either).  It's amazing how many things in your life change after getting sober.
