I've been sober for a while now.  It's awesome!  I feel like I'm in no way at risk to relapse.  Last night I drank nothing more potent than a spicy homemade soda. So everything is going well and I'm doing just fine....  But I woke up this morning with the exact sort of headache that I used to get with my hangovers. Weird!

Then youre dehydrated. Drink water! 
Possible dehydration? Did you drink enough water yesterday? Night sweats? Possible illness coming on? Or maybe just maybe was your body storing that one up to mess with you for all the years of self-destruction? I would expect no less from my tricky bastard of a brain...
I get these on occasions; usually related to sinus dry heat during the winter etc.  No biggie plenty of water and a aspirin or two.  Remember the old days?  Yikes!  
Maybe rethink the recipe for your spicy soda.
Probably need to drink some water. 
Migraine. Also caffeine withdrawal headache. Both.
