My first AA meeting was mostly a blur I was crying the whole time. I was approached by a guy who worked at my company. We exchanged numbers went to meetings together went to breakfast together checked in with each other. He really helped me. We relapsed around the same time. My last check in was two weeks ago he mentioned he was getting bad again a little depressed but didn't want to talk about it. Last night I found out that committed suicide last week. My heart hurts and this was a slap in the face on many levels. I will not drink today. I don't have a place irl to express my feelings thanks for letting me share here.

You have the same meetings. Make sure you have numbers of people you can call. 
So sorry for you loss. We're all here for you.
Jesus that's tough. Much love to you. Xx
How awful I am so sorry.  But for the grace of God there go I (and many of us I imagine) as well.  Are you sober today?
Sorry for your loss. 
I'm sorry for your loss.  I'll keep you in my prayers.
Oh Jeepers - am so sorry for your loss. Losing someone to suicide can be particularly difficult to try to deal with. I have no advice (except don't pick up that first drink) But would just like you to know that I'm thinking about you and hope that you get the love and support that you need x
Thank you all. I was up very late the night before last when I got the news. I ended up sleeping around 12 hours after work yesterday. I did not drink I'm very well rested today. His services are this evening. I will s also not drink today!
