Hello!..The idea of having severe withdrawal effects terrifies me. However I'm not sure if it's based on an irrational fear. Let me explain...&amp;#x200B;..About a year or so ago I drank a bunch (highest was 13.5 standard drinks\* (whiskey usually) on a given day) but not every day. After a while I read about tapering and I decided to go that way so I decided to go easy and reduce a standard drink per day and when down to about 3 half a drink per day. This worked very well I got some withdrawal symptoms like irritability insomnia itchiness etc. but I dealt with it (didn't have a heavy load of work so that helped)...&amp;#x200B;..\*^(I use small shots for measuring so I drink 1.33 shots to make it one standard drink of about 1.5oz (43ml) (yes I did take the time to measure the amount one of my shots holds so for example: 18 small shots = 13.5 standard drinks.))..&amp;#x200B;..After about two months sober I sort of relapsed (the idea was not to stop drinking completely but to cut down after the sober period) drinking mostly on weekends (usually 4 standard drinks (switched to Vodka) but sometimes 8). I kept that up for about 4 or 5 months...&amp;#x200B;..Last week however work was too heave and some things were annoying me a lot so I decided to  drink "just a bit" during weekdays. Usually 3 standard drinks daily but this got out of control last friday (Nov 30) when I drank much more (about 9) then on Saturday I drank 12 and then on Sunday 10. I had enough then so I decided I should cut back again and taper so I decidedly began cutting back...&amp;#x200B;..Now here comes the interesting part. On Monday I cut back to 8.5 but I started reading about tapering again and this time I found out about severe withdrawal effects reading about how these can present themselves even if you taper off. The articles usually mention that this happens if you drink too much but that is part of my question: I don't know if I count as heavy drinker. I don't drink that much (I think) and I sort of had it under control until the past week. So let me do a quick run so you can tell me what you think:..&amp;#x200B;..**From April to November 24**: average of 6 standard drinks (8 small shots) **on Saturdays and never during the week**...**November 25 to 29**: average of 3-4 standard drinls (4-6 small shots) daily...**Friday Nov 30**: 9 standard drinks (12 small shots)..**Saturday and Sunday**: 10.5 standard drinks (14 small shots)..**Monday**: 8.5 standard drinks (11.5 small shots)..**Tuesday**: 7.5 standard drinks (10 small shots)..**Wednesday**: 5.2 standard drinks (7 small shots)..**Thursday**: 3 standard drinks (4 small shots)..**Friday**: 2.6 standard drinks (3.5 small shots)..**Today**: 2.25 standard drinks (3 small shots) (drank the last one about 30 mins ago)..&amp;#x200B;..Since Tuesday I've been spacing my drinking (one shot every 1/1.30/2hrs as the week goes by)...Other things affecting my system are: I drink 3 small cups of coffee daily + 3 cups of tea. I usually work a lot. Eat relatively healthy and I exercise regularly (cardio and muscle building) (although this week I didn't do any kind of exercise due to the drinking). I'm not usually stressed...&amp;#x200B;..Now the thing is I'm terrified after reading about seizures and DTs as well as the stories of those who went through them. So on Wednesday I had a lot of anxiety and a bit of spasms while trying to sleep (as well as some half-asleep apnea). I couldn't get my mind away from thinking ("What if I was lucky last time?" "What if these spasms mean I'm going to have seizures?" "What if I die because of cardiac arrest while having a seizure episode?" etc). And yesterday I couldn't sleep well because I was anxious again but not as bad as on Wednesday...Funny thing is last time I tapered I never had that kind of anxiety or thoughts and I simply had some other symptoms (and I had been drinking more and for longer). Could the switch to Vodka also be a factor? Is it more dangerous than Whiskey? Am I being unreasonable and obsessing over this?..&amp;#x200B;..Symptoms I have are a bit of oppression on the head and jaw (very mild) shakes and some insomnia (interrupted sleep). On the first couple of days I had some tingling on feet and hands. All of these symptoms come and go and are not present all the time.  ...Any help will be welcome. Thanks.
