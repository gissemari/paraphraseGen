I went a solid year without drinking and life was good. I am not sure what happened. We had a lot going on with the family and for some reason I felt I really wasn't getting anything from meetings. It seemed to me that everyone there was just waiting for their turn to talk nobody 'truely' gave a damn. Well I'm tired of this little mini relapse and I want to get back on the right path again. Hopefully this time I will find some people that are more than just a blank face.

Try some different meetings. There's all sorts. I had to shop around a bit to find my favorite.
If you have the option to try multiple different meetings. Try different meetings on different days in different areas. ..Also most AA meetings practice a whole *no crosstalk* thing. ..So even if they want to address whatever you are saying it's uncouth to do so. ..Hang out after the meeting take a commitment and gain some sober buddies. that will help you get more.
