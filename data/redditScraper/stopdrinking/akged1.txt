I'm struggling with the expectation vs. reality that removing this from my life seems to have not improved things much.  It doesn't seem to be the way things go for most to read the stories here.  I was probably having 8 or 10 drinks or more every day before for more than 5 years.  There have been some nights where I slept a little better and many days where I was proud about my resolve without really feeling like I was missing out on drinking even in the company of other drinkers.  But I still find myself full of dread in the middle of the night and still want to stay in bed and everything seems to take more effort than it should.  I am exhausted by taking life a day at a time an hour or step at a time; I'm not feeling hopeful that in sticking with it the path forward will present itself and feeling discouraged about how little seems to have changed...How long have the rest of you found they needed to stick with this before things improved?  I've found myself again being tempted by the possibility of any relief even the punishingly short relief that comes from drinking.  I'm not planning on caving this time but maybe helpful to hear any similar stories of inspiration.  Or even stories that are not inspiring but simply true...I recognize this as depression and have taken just about every measure possible to fight against it diet and exercise meditation walks in nature playing music reading and writing teetotaling.  But it seems to amount to very little.  I thought giving up alcohol would at least do away with the incessant thoughts of escaping from life altogether...Thanks for reading.

Your words touch home only 52 days sober for me..Stay strong. Thanks for sharing..IWNDWYT or tomorrow
How much sober time do you have in??  ..For me even within the first few months MANY things got better:  My depression and anxiety were virtually gone I was eating and sleeping better; my self esteem improved as I began to gain control of the demon who controlled me; the list goes on and on.  ..As the saying goes "Don't walk ten miles into a forest and expect to come out in five."
Your experience seems very similar to mine in fact I could have written this post and if you look at my post history there's even a post very similar to this one. If your alcohol use was partly a way to deal with underlying mental health issues then stopping drinking will go a long way towards helping you start to deal with those issues but it won't cure them. ..It sounds like you're already doing a lot of the right things depression and anxiety are a bitch to have to live with. That oppressive feeling of just not wanting to be here any more wanting to hit a big red stop button and fighting that grinds you down. I know where you're at and it sucks. Know that you're not the only one and that there is a way through this. I know you can't see it or feel it at the moment you but you've done a great thing and taken a huge step by stopping drinking. You are honoring yourself and allowing yourself to feel what is really there. Now at the moment that isn't very pleasant but avoiding by trying to drown those feelings and yourself in alcohol it isn't going make it go away. The only way forward is through. If you aren't already I strongly suggest seeing a professional you can talk to about this there's no shame in reaching out for help and this sub is always here and others devoted to helping with mental health issues. Good luck on your journey you're not alone. IWNDWYT
Congratulations on your progress...Every re-set starts over sometimes with worsening initial effects...I find that when I focus on today and not forecast into tomorrow I'm much better off.  
How long have you been sober? I noticed how much easier it was to sleep after a month and its after getting those good solid nights of sleep that my anxiety and depression evaporated are you a big caffeine drinker? i have to put limits on my intake or it disrupts my sleep. 
[Sobriety timeline](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2sf5jm/my_attempt_at_an_alcohol_recovery_timeline/) from another post...My experience:..**Cravings and mental health**..Took me 3-6 months to stop craving most days. I still had occasional cravings flare up for the first year right up through month 11...Around 6 months I noticed my memory had massively improved. Went from having you start repeating an address again midway through to remembering them unprompted the next day...Anxiety was massive for the first few months and has gone down considerably...I have depression and it took about 6-8 weeks of not drinking for them to start doing anything...**Material shit**..Took me at least a year to get my shit together at work. 2 years for a career-first promotion from rank-and-file engineer skipping senior to principal...About 3 years to go from massive debt and constantly being broke  to being debt free owning my own home and multiple vehicles. ..**Emotional**..About two years for my brain to really get back to something normal. Still working on improving my mental health but have made a bit of a quantum leap this year...**"I'm Bored"**..First year had a lot of empty time in it. My routine was basically work gym (sometimes) AA read r/stopdrinking. Work gym AA SD. Repeat. Sometimes throw in going to the beach or dog park or an AA thing. Not the world's most exciting year but necessary...Year two started finding some hobbies. Bass was the main one both electric and standup. Rented the world's shittiest plywood upright bass because I was broke as fuck. ..Year three started doing track days in my beater track car. Saved up some money and went to racing school...Year four raced in two semi-pro races in my shiny new-to-me Radical SR3. Did okay for a newbie and had a blast. Vacations aplenty test days in the Radical. Had a baby which definitely takes some time off your hands. Bought a house. More stuff to do than time this year. ..**tl;dr**..**You don't get fucked up overnight you can't get unfucked overnight.** Keep chipping away at it taking that next right step and your life can totally change.
