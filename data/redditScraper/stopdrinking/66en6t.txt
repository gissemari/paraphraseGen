Had a win last night..I started getting cravings hard core. I drove straight past the liquor store and went home and had a dance party with my kids and drunk copious amounts of lemonade. It got me through the cravings and I have woken up feeling better for it. I am only on day 3 but already feel better. The next few days will be hard as I have my kids away for 4 days. I will stay strong and am comitted this time around to stick with it.  I struggle between day 2 and 5. I will get through.

You can do it!  
Many people here wrote that day 4 is tought. It was also for me. So I knew I can't give up at day 4 and that was my plan. Day 5 was much better because of that.
