So I have a very sordid alcoholic past. I'm really fantastic at relapsing by moderating for a time then jumping right back into the deep deep end. The last beer I had was last Saturday. It had been a few days since I'd had any and I nursed that beer for an hour and a half. Of course this already has my addict brain telling me that not only can I do it again but that it would be *good* for me. I think it will be a gentler approach to not have cold withdrawals a little one to help tie the brain chemistry over. . ...Please explain to me how my brain is fibbing to me! Extra points for scientific facts :) Thanks guys!

If you haven't experienced any physical withdrawal symptoms since last Saturday there's no need to ease off. That's surely your inner addict piping up. It's just a craving it will pass. It might be in the front of your mind for a while but it will pass. Yeah those first few sober weekends are tough. I used to drink coffee and write in an actual pen and paper journal. It really helped and I still go back and read it sometimes.
&gt;Please explain to me how my brain is fibbing to me...Gooogling  Kindling Effect  will provide a scientific description.  Adding alcohol after removing alcohol increases adverse effects...Whatever  gentler  impact you perceive will be offset more significantly at each subsequent removal of alcohol...Said differently if you perceive your discomfort presently at  X  then having some alcohol now will erase the progress you've earned and create some order of magnitude greater than  X  if stopping again...Whadda ya think?
