I am so grateful to be up on a Sunday morning with a cup of coffee listening to music (Katie Herzig - check her out!) and feeling so fresh. ..I did battle cravings especially as there's cold beer in the fridge and I'm temporarily living with my alcoholic mother. Friday night I almost caved but went to bed instead and woke up feeling SO glad. I had lots of Diet Coke this weekend. ..Things I managed to achieve:.1) A trip into town to sort out a hair appointment and then shopping for a few bits I needed.2) About 5 hours of ironing while watching Southern Charm.3) Ate healthy and stuck to my diet so I am a few lbs lighter.4) Making plans for a successful week ahead ..I had a luxurious lie in this morning and woke up nice while my mother's struggling with a hangover. Could relate to that awful anxious feeling and did not wish that was me! ..Grateful!!

Nice work! What a great way to appreciate sobriety.  It's great you are able to recognize all of the positives sobriety is creating in your life.
Way to go Tinkerbell.   Tackling chores sober is so much easier and productive.  I did the salon thing too yesterday somehow a half inch off turned into an inch 1/2 in some areas.  It's only hair. I'll make it work!  ..
I had forgotten how amazing sober weekends are. This is my first in SO long. It was tough but damn it's so worth it. The weekends feel so much longer when you're not drowning them in alcohol or laying around hungover!..Glad you're having a good one! :)
I know this is a week old but Katie Herzig is awesome!
