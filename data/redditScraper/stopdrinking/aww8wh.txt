Today is 60 days sober for me and it was my birthday last night. I still had friends over for a party but this year I drank carbonate water instead of beer whisky and bourbon. ..This year in the two days leading up to my birthday I worked out and went running. Last year I was on day 3 or 4 of a bender woke up still drunk and continued my drinking for another day.  ..These 60 straight days of sobriety are the longest streak I've had in 27 years and my first sober birthday since I started drinking at age 16. ..In high school drinking to get drunk was fun and new. In my 20's it was social lubricant to meet girls and what you did every weekend (funny Iesson recently learned: I always thought I was an extrovert turns out I was just a drunk introvert at almost every social function my entire adult life). In my 30's drinking was just a habit. In the last few years and the start of my 40's it was rare to string together more than a week sober and the blackouts were frequent. ..I've known I needed to slow down or stop my drinking for years. I just never really knew how to get there. ..I had been trying to moderate drinking for my whole adult life with little success. I remember nights when I was able to actually moderate and waking up the next morning feeling proud that I didn't get wasted. I thought about that recently and how messed up it was that I would actually be proud of the odd time I managed to not get blackout drunk...I found this sub in December 2017 and it was through reading everyone's posts that I was able to finally start to understand my own drinking problem. I was a lurker here and continued to drink until November 2018 when I took the advice that many here have given and purchased the audiobook of This Naked Mind. That book helped me change the way I thought about alcohol and I took the 30 day alcohol free challenged. After completing the challenge I got cocky and assumed that I could obviously now moderate. I had a few drinks to celebrate 30 sober days then a few more the next day then a wild weekend filled with booze then the whole month turned into Bender-December. ..After experiencing all the positive benefits of not drinking for 30 days then getting directly back into a heavy drinking lifestyle it finally became clear. There were only two ways this was going to go for me. I could get sober and see exactly how much better life could get beyond 30 days of sobriety or I could keep going down this increasingly dark unhealthy lonely path. ..I've been sober since Jan.2nd 2019 and it has been a long journey to get to this point. Like many things in life there is no one correct path it's going to be different for everyone. What worked for me was constantly checking this sub for inspirational posts from all of you the books This Naked Mind and Alcohol Explained and the I Am Sober app which is another tool providing motivation by watching your sober days count add up. ..I've learned many things in the last 60 days. I've learned that I can string together a lot of consistency in all areas of my life when I'm not constantly self sabotaging by drinking and having to always reset my motivation and focus trying to get back on track after a big bender or massive hangover. ..Life is a lot easier when I'm not wasting all of my time trying to recover from the constant stream of poison I was pouring into my body. ..But the main thing I've learned is that I don't actually need alcohol in my life and more importantly that I don't miss it. ..Everything is better without alcohol in my life. Everything. ..So on this sunny hangover free Sunday I wanted to say a huge thank you to everyone in this sub I truely appreciate everything you do to help each of us be better. Keep encouraging us you have no idea how much it means when we are struggling. ..You have truly been my main source of support and I wish all of you the greatest success in life. ..Thank you!..

I did Annie's 30 Day Alcohol Experiment too and experienced what life could be like without alcohol.   I too tried to figure out how to moderate after the challenge.   Accepting the fact that I couldn't do that and remembering how good I felt during the experiment I finally got  back on track where I need to be...Congratulations on your success and Happy Birthday!
Interesting.  I am 45 days sober and just experienced my first sober birthday (and hangover free day after) in 50 years.
