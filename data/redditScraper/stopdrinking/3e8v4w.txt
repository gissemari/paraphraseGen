I've been around this sub for about a year and a half sometimes posting rarely sharing... so here's another story. Maybe this will help any newcomers that are trying to see if they can relate to people trying to get sober. ..To all the veterans and old timers pardon the drunkalogue... ..I grew up in the suburbs and had everything I could need or want. I had a happy healthy upbringing and loving parents. No complaints. I tried weed when I was 17 and having never experienced inebriation before immediately fell in love with it. By 18 I was smoking more days than I wasn't but wasn't much of a drinker. I had a drink or two of my parents' booze to experiment but didn't like the taste and never really got the effect. I got drunk for the first time when I was 18 and naive to the combination of marijuana and alcohol mixed them both and spent the rest of the evening vomiting. Alcohol wasn't really for me but I loved getting high. I always looked forward to the next time I'd get smoke with my friends usually at my buddy "Donuts" house. He had a dad that didn't care. ..I spent the summer after high school smoking as much as I could (without getting high before work). I wanted to be functional and not a dumb stoner after all. In college I calmed down a bit tried to focus on my studies but eventually came back to getting high daily by the second semester. I didn't drink much but when I did it was to get drunk and I'd usually end up vomiting. My cannabis intake increased my sophomore year and alcohol started to grow on me. By this time I was selling weed to cover my habit. By junior and senior years of college I was selling more and more weed still smoking daily and having a few drinks to wind down at the end of the day. I kept my grades up had a great girlfriend and was president of a student group. I thought I was doing okay. And in some ways I guess I was. But as I was coming down from a harrowing mushroom trip I looked around and realized that nothing was how I imagined it would be. My life wasn't supposed to be built on getting high and selling drugs. I didn't really know how to change it though. Plus I didn't think I had a problem I just thought I was having a good time. ..Towards the end of college I said enough was enough and I stopped smoking weed. Within a few weeks I was getting drunk to replace weed. This escalated very quickly and within a month I was getting drunk every day as early as I could without disrupting my classes. Again consequences were at a minimum and mainly just led me to a sedentary boring life. ..Then my girlfriend starts to notice my drinking. Then we break up. Then I drink more. Then I graduate and start a new job. I go out with coworkers black out and wake up naked on my bosses couch. I peed in his closet. He thinks it's funny. I black out a few weeks later and nearly lose my roommate's bike. I start drinking in the morning on weekends. I start keeping vodka in my car for the ride home from work. I start drinking away my weekends. I show up to dates drunk. I find a nice girl. I black out hit her degrade her and remember nothing. I drive drunk...Then I drink before work. That's where I drew the line. I quit drinking for 7 months but about 2 months in I start playing around with Oxy. Within 5 months I've decided Oxy is too rich for my blood and I switch to heroin. While going through withdrawals I drink. Just once. Then I relapse again a month later. I start going to work drunk. I drink in the bathroom and in my car. I black out one evening and tell my friend I want to kill myself. When I'm drunk it's true. I do. I hate life when I'm drunk. Sometimes I hate life when I'm sober too. ..I had my last drink on April 2 2015. I had my last line of heroin 2 weeks ago on Thursday. I still smoke and think I probably need to work on that...I still think I can control this. I am obviously mistaken but I want to hammer in that message for anyone who thinks they'll "know" when they've lost control. Your bottom might surprise you. ..**Things that have worked:**..* As /u/coolcrosby advises make a commitment to not drink TODAY. Thinking about forever scares me and makes me want to drink/use or just say "fuck it."..* AA. I have not worked the steps or get a sponsor. I probably should but sitting in the meetings reminds me that this stuff wants me ALONE and DEAD. It keeps my eyes on the prize...* This sub. Again it helps me stay focused and reminds me what matters. Thank you...* Telling my friends. I have many friends that know I don't drink anymore and they still love me. They're real friends. I have 2 friends that know I did heroin. They still love me too. They are there when I need them and I CALL THEM when I need them. I have started asking for more help...**Things that have not worked:**..* Switching drugs. I like to escape reality. I like to switch my head off. That's my big problem. The alcohol heroin and weed are just symptoms of that. ..I'm still learning a lot. Truthfully I almost feel like I'm quitting for the first time again today. Yesterday I felt so low I called out of work smoked a bunch and just watched TV. I feel stuck again even without the alcohol or heroin. Maybe it's latent heroin PAWS maybe it's the weed I'm not sure. I was close to drinking today even though I knew it wouldn't help. I almost didn't care enough. ..I will say that I've progressed and matured significantly since I've quit alcohol. Some of that is simply being a year and a half older (I'm 25) but some of that is being PRESENT enough to recognize life. ..I wish I could close with something inspirational but I'm truthfully not feeling super inspired today. Still this is better than drinking. My relapses were violent and horrible. They were dangerous. Hopefully this reaches someone out there who's on the fence. It is tough but you are not alone. It doesn't have to be like this. ..Thanks for listening.
