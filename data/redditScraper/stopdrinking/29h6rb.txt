The acceptance of being an alcoholic was easy to admit it was as clear as the nose in my face accepting what that meant for me? Whole different story. I didn't pay much attention to it every time I did I got frustrated I don't believe it is what lead to multiple relapses....this time (ten years later) I had change everything about "my program" I was well on my way when tackling this subject again. For me it wasn't accepting that I was an alcoholic that I was good with it was that in so doing I would have to accept that in sobriety my son never had to forgive me honestly it was all about him it was too painful. I couldn't accept living a sober life in which he wasn't a part of it's silly I don't have control of his feelings but I just could not fathom wanting to live without him in my life.  Even being sober and having no intent on drinking again I'm not sure if I really wanted to live. I don't know if that makes sense but my counselor said we early needed to come back to this point again as long as I could put it off I did. I finally came around my thought process was more "what choice do I have?" I reserved a little place to crumble if I was confronted with the loss of him in my life. Our relationship was improving he was starting to be the one to initiate contact which pleased me very much. ..I had a huge test coming up many of you know that I am pregnant this baby is going to be adopted I kept it very quiet from my family I'm due in two months until a month ago only two souls knew my parents I told them only because I was going to be involved with them a lot and I knew I couldn't hide it. My family is made up of very good and wonderful people but is also 50% Mormon...so there's that. My son got a job working at Yellowstone for the summer and last month he was flying in and my mom and I were going to take him from SLC to Yellowstone. My mom told me that if I didn't want to tell him we could avoid the visit and when his job is over I won't be pregnant anymore....I told her no I had to suck it up. That was the true test of my acceptance of how he feels about me. I waited till 2 days before he left NOLA for SLC. ..I was bawling my eyes out while telling him needless to say he was shocked at one point in the conversation he said "mommom Mom!!! I wish I was there and could give you the hug I know you need right now"...My long journey to acceptance was finally over.
