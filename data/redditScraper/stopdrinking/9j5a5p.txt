I struggle with depression and anxiety as I've mentioned on previous posts on here...7 days last night since I've had a drink. Will be 8 days at 9.30pm tonight so just 2 hours from now...I feel positive. My wife says I'm different she says I'm nicer. I'm patient. I do more stuff with my son instead of just sitting around waiting to drink...I've realised by looking back now that I was a problem drinker. I never had a drink until 6 or 7pm but when I did I'd have several beers and always go to bed by 11pm drunk. Which wasn't healthy. It contributed to my depression and anxiety...I'm still taking it 1 day at a time I'm not getting carried away. But I feel good at this moment and I'm enjoying it...IWNDWYT.

I am happy for you! Congratulations on a week! IWNDWYT 
Yep I totally agree. In the moment it helps dull the pain but the next day it's always worse. Every day it's just a little bit worse...I'm only 2 days in but when I woke up this morning I felt so much better already. Not perfect but definitely better. I usually wake up to night terrors at 1am or 10 minutes before I wake up on the verge of a panic attack ruminating over the stage of my life. 
Hi Sober Twin! I also struggle with anxiety and depression but I'm learning about healthier ways to deal with those issues. Here's to us on making it a week!
Congrats on a week. I'm only on day 12 but day 6-7 is when i turned the corner and the habit of not drinking sets in. ..You've got the hard part done. Now don't forget how shitty it was 8 days ago. 
You're pretty lucky if you feel better after 8 days. Ive been like 3 weeks and everyday feels just as shitty as the last
