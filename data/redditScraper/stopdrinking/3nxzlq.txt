Happy Thursday /r/stopdrinking!..Thankful Thursdays is a weekly thread here an opportunity to focus and reflect on what we are grateful for **today**...Writing down 5 gratitudes and 5 acknowledgements daily has supported my sobriety it's been transformational helping recognise the good in the world around me and within my own actions and thus raising my mood and motivation. The gratitudes in particular have helped how I experience the world I live in opened my eyes to recognise the beauty and wonder of the world around me. They've been my go-to tool when I'm experiencing fear or attitude. It shifts my focus from lack and regret to recognise the abundance and opportunity around me. It is literally counting my blessings...I frame my gratitudes in the positive make them about TODAY make them specific and they aren't necessary big things they can be really small. ..---..**Thankful quote and youtube vid:**..>*Even when especially when adversity strikes gratitude has the power to help you thrive.*..~ [The Gratitude Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHxlXLDMG0Q)...The principle in this quote is very important for me: even when things don't go my way when I'm struggling it's easy for me to focus on the bad to catastrophise to falsely convince myself I can't cope.  If I do that it is because I have lost perspective it is gratitude that helps me get that perspective back: to remind myself of the abundance and blessings that are all around me each day. Gratitude helps me to discover the serenity acceptance and satisfaction with my life exactly as it is even in the face of bad news. It is important for me to focus on what I have not on what I don't have. ..---..**So sobernauts**..**What are you grateful for today?** .

I am thankful I have learned to be a duck an icy tarn a mountain; to accept change and be wise. Not always far from perfectly and always with effort.
I am grateful today for being able to feel gratitude.  I know that sounds like a cop-out but I really feel like without gratitude my life would feel only one or at the most two dimensional.  As it stands now because I feel a deep appreciation for so many things around me on a daily basis I feel deeper and see more than what I would without it. It's like having an extra set of eyes that makes the world a more beautiful place.  [I recently started doing this again to remember my gratitude for the last 100 days of this year too.](https://flic.kr/s/aHskkUTnGX)..P.S.  399 is a nice number.  :-)
