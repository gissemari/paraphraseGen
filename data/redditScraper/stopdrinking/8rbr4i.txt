When I first put down the bottle   and by that I mean: my usual 3-4 16oz cans/day of Steel Reserve and a pint or two of vodka and occasionally a bottle of pinot grigio on the rocks for breakfast   my intention was really to only fast from booze for 100 days. I've never really promised to myself or anyone else that I've given it up for good but it's pretty solidly in my head that that's the path that needs to be taken.  ..In my earlier sobriety I looked forward to hitting  1000 days.  It's an impressive number and certainly something I would have undoubtedly believed to be impossible say 1030 days ago...But my 1000 came and went and I missed it like a clueless husband not remembering his wedding anniversary. ..Believe it or not I relish having missed this milestone and hope that it can inspire you. Sometime between 1007 days ago and now not-drinking transitioned from a constant concious battle to more of a subconscious hard-wiring. I missed my milestone because I really wasn't thinking that much of drinking that day and I'm grateful. ..To those early in the struggle: stay strong. It feels good on top. IWNDWYT.

Great insight thanks for sharing this. Yes each day I'm counting but starting to wonder if i should focus on other things.. number is meaningless in reality as its back to ourselves. ..congrats mate!

\&gt;  Sometime between 1007 days ago and now not-drinking transitioned from a constant concious battle to more of a subconscious hard-wiring.  ...This is seriously just what I needed to hear.
Congrats on passing the 1k mark! I'm a long ways away from there but I will get there. One amazing sober day at a time.
i find it interesting how sometimes believing that after reaching a forward date you could have a drink similar to just taking it day by day is comforting. it's a bit like a donkey and a carrot on a stick. except we keep going until the dunkey is dead or at least asleep. but think about it ... its interesting.
