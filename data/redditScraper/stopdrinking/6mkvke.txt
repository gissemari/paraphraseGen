Thank you all for the much needed support this past week since I relapsed last Monday. All your messages of kindness and wisdom are so appreciated. I hope you all know that. An update to The Relapse Aftermath: The Husband is no longer treating me like he is a hate filled psychopath. He has even re invited me to our upcoming beach house vacation in NC with our whole family. Our amazing adult sons my wonderful daughter in law and my mother in law have been so great to me. All I can do to thank them is NOT drink. And so for today **I GOT THAT.**
