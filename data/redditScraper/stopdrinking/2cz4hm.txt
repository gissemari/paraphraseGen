Hey all found this subreddit thanks to /r/alcoholism. Two nights ago I admitted myself to ER I was in really really bad shape. Now I'm doing a home treatement with check ups several days a week at a rehab center very close to me. I feel like I hit the rock bottom again but started again with antabuse (never dared to drink on it ever so no worries). Also got some calming medication + sleeping pills so I'm feeling better. The shame guilt and some of the angst is still there (might've lost my summer job). But this just proved again how fucking sick I am of drinking how it always and always will end up like this if not worse. Yet another wake up call. It feels like a relief for me to be on antabuse because I have absolutely no excuse to go and buy booze for myself. Will continue with counselling and reconsidering AA. One day at a time right?..Thank you for listening. I'm ready to start over (again).

Yeah AA is not anyone's first choice. ..But it worked for me despite myself.  ..Good luck welcome back
One day at a time is correct. Hang in there and use this Sub as much as needed. I'm on this site day and night. PM me if you ever need to chat. Day or night. Stay strong and get better. :)

Hello /u/Prkle glad to see you made it here!
Thank you for posting. We can do this together!
Hello!!!  Good to see you here!  
You have nothing to be ashamed of everyone's path has a few rocks in it!
I'm curious as to what happened to make you relapse? What led up to it?..If you don't want to share that's fine I always find them very helpful to learn what not to do
