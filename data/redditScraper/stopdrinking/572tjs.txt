Welcome! As you mention your last drink was 2 hours ago please be aware that we ask in  the [participation guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index#wiki_post_only_while_sober.) for this subreddit that you only post when sober...In the meanwhile there's lots of information in the posts here and lots to explore in the sidebar. Most people set their badge date to their first sober day..
