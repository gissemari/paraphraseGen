Hello SD!..So I had a dream last night that I was headed to rehab in my head it was the 3rd time I was heading there but I was sober for a good amount of time. I woke up feeling the need to drink. My brain just immediately went to "you went to rehab you're cured of your obsession" from a dream! I'm writing here because I am on my longest sobriety streak to date I'm in a new city with a family support system and I'm scared that I'll throw away all of my progress...I missed a meeting yesterday maybe that's why...I've started to isolate with the weather the new city (I've been here 3 days) and I'm scared to even leave my apartment. I don't know why. ..Reflecting back I used the word "scared" a lot in this post...much like my last fear of relapse post. Any tips on changing this fear into a more productive line of thought? Fear is my primary motivator to drink...even though my logical mind knows that alcohol won't make anything better...thoughts? Suggestions to help with the isolation? I have AA but I may be ready to make friends outside of that now...I have no friends here...even my "friends" aren't friends anymore. I'm lonely I'm tired...

I've been having drinking dreams lately.  Messes up your head a little the next day.  Lonely is probably the most honest description for where you are so you can feel good that you are in touch.  The best way to meet people is to be out of your apartment or house.  each time I moved even if to a new neighborhood I would spend hours walking around and learning about it.  That would be a good start.  Take a walk and learn your neighborhood.  Give yourself some air and some confidence that you are making that place yours.  You will gain confidence and eventually meet some neighbors and start seeing the same people.  Making real friends takes a lot of time and effort so be patient.  If there is someone in the group you are drawn to why not ask them to go for a coffee and just hang out and talk?  Like they always say one day at a time.  One step at a time.
