Shit...So I haven't been home to see family for the past few months because I've been dealing with my own thing trying to get/stay sober. But today I decided enough was enough and I'm going to drive home to see my mom and little brother...Mind you my mom has been somewhat under the impression that I'm still 10 months sober instead of 42 days sober because I didn't have the heart to tell her I'd relapsed. But I knew when I saw her I'd have to tell her the truth or she'd ask me how it's going and I didn't want to have to lie to her just to make/keep her happy. So I was really nervous to visit as well as excited. The last time she saw me I was probably around 150-160lbs and now I'm up to 220 and I'm growing out my hair and mustache and I was worried she was going to comment on these physical changes which I would take personally...Anyway after a 2.5 hour drive I'm finally at her front door and we hugged for a while then I went in to sit and talk with her a while before my brother got home from his hockey game. We caught up with the minor details and then she says "I've got something I need to tell you before your brother does. It's something I didn't want to tell you over the phone. About a month ago I relapsed and it was 5 times worse than last time and I got a DUI. I have to go to court to see what happens to my license."..After she shared that I didn't feel any hesitation or worry admitting that I too had been drinking on and off the past few months. She asked me about what I'd do if I got caught considering I live in a sober house and it really brought the gravity of my predicament to bear on me because I don't have a place to live if I do get kicked out...She never mentioned my weight she commented on the mustache but it wasn't the least bit judgmental. Then my brother came home and I got to spend the rest of the time hanging out with him hearing about what he's up to these days we played pool together (he beat me both games) and played on his PS4 before we had lunch and then I had to get back to where I lived for work...All this just to say... I love my mom. I've always wrestled with this desire to make her happy and the illusion that she's better than me when in reality I'm not responsible for her happiness and she and I are both adults struggling with the same family disease...Thanks for reading. I'm not going to drink today.

My wife got a DUI and it spurred some change for her...Sorry she's having that trouble but the good that comes out of it may be that you are closer and able to be together on the sober journey.
&gt;when in reality I'm not responsible for her happiness and she and I are both adults struggling with the same family disease...That's a true statement there. I hated admitting my problem but as soon as I did I took a little power away from it. I'm sure your mom felt just as relieved as you did after opening up...I won't drink with you today!
