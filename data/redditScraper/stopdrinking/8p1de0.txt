Most of us know the struggle of quitting losing our way quitting again etc. I'm on Day 2 after a month of binge drinking that followed 10.5 months of sobriety...This song [Days are Gone by Haim](https://youtu.be/rGluf6-0Cz8) always picks me up when I have to start over or need encouragement. Thought I'd share some of the lyrics for you all:..And I got back up.When I lost control over it all over it all..And I knew that I couldn't take no more.'Cause I want it all I want it all..All the times I've said it.All the times I've said it before..Those days are gone..'Cause you didn't know how.And I know that now.I want it all I want it all..Felt like I was walking on a tight rope..Those days are gone those days are gone..Sometimes I wish I didn't miss you at all..Those days are gone..Holding on holding on holding on.Those days are gone.And now I'm waiting for the day to dawn.Those days are gone..I remember when you found it hard to give.But I gave it all I gave you my all.You only took one side.When all my hopes ran dry.Those dreams are gone gone all along.All the times I said it.All the times I've said it before.I'm moving on..    You can have my past I'll never get that back    ..I'm moving on 'cause those days are gone.
