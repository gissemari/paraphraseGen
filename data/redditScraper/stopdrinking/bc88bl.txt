Hi! Full disclosure. I relapsed yesterday so today is Day 1. The reason I relapsed was because the company I own got a new client and we wanted to celebrate. We got some wine and nothing crazy happened but I still drank. I don't want this to happen again so I'm looking for alternatives for celebrating a big win. I'd really like to avoid a food reward because I'm dealing with some weight issues as well. I still want to celebrate with my team but struggle on how to do that without alcohol.

Say  I'm good for now  or  I'm on a 30 day detox  etc. kind of stinks but most people are not supportive of sobriety. As for actually answering your question on what to have instead  be careful with substituting sugar. For me it's sparkling water
Those large glass Pellegrino bottles always feel celebratory to me. Maybe keep a couple on hand along with some fresh lime so that you're prepared even if your co-workers want to celebrate with alcohol.
Can you bring in someone to do chair massages/mani pedis for the staff? Order one of those fruit arrangements for the team? Healthier than booze!
