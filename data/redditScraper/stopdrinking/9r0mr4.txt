I cannot imagine relapsing this go round. I've done so much work to ensure a new mindset and I feel optimistic about each day. However I've read so many stories on here that remind me I can never let my guard down I must always remain on offensive. I've done this so far through reading books and posts on this sub as well as therapy. Haven't done meetings but I often see people who have describes the steps of relapse. My favorite is the example of climbing the ladder...Again I don't see myself in jeopardy of relapse but I have to be sure to stay off that ladder. The first rung is usually described as looking back fondly on drinking memories. I have done this. I have been in situations where I recall having a good time in the past associated with alcohol. So I am here to remind myself (and share with you) that alcohol was the cause of misery not happiness. I don't think I ever really had that 'just one beer' I seem to be remembering. I know I can't have just one for me it is none...Thanks for listening while I hop back to the solid ground of reality. IWNDWYT

Well done!!! What a great accomplishment to have achieved that state of mind 
I think I know exactly what you mean.  I often think that there is no way i will relapse this time the thought of drinking does not appeal to me at all! The hiding and sneaking just seems exhausting...and then I read a post about someone that was sober longer than I and decided they could try to drink again and I realize that I might think that sometime.  I can't see how right now but I refuse to let my guard all of the way down.
