*Trigger warning relapse!*..(disregard the flair I relapsed).What is wrong with me? I have a good life I keep my shit together I parent my child well I pay my bills care for my pets keep my house reasonably clean work hard ect..but I always want beer. I never get black out drunk or even sloppy but it's getting ridiculous. ..I have gotten to the point that if I don't drink I am shakey. I need at least two 22 oz 8% bottles of beer a day now. I can't believe it's come to this. I can see it progressing like a fucking freight train on a downhill run. I am seriously concerned. I'm over 40 and dont have time to do this much longer...I see my doc on the 26th and I am thinking about coming clean to her. I feel like such a loser though. I have tried to stop before but when I do it seems like I just end up drinking more. ..It scares me. What if I actually can't quit? What if I am one of the lost? I am sad and scared because I have never not been able to stop before. I can get a month or so and then I seem to drink even more. Or want to. It never seems to leave me. Ugh   ..How in the heck to you guys quit??

Started with being honest to the doctor for me. It made it real. Told me I had to stop that day. And I did. It was a mental shift for me. ..Went from I don't drink to I can't drink.
