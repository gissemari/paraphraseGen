I will not drink.  It's so sunny and hot outside and I'm struggling today for no real reason.  I thought that having many months under my belt by the time this great weather rolled in would make it simpler.  Maybe it has but it's still not easy...I've got my La Croix.  I've got projects to do.  I've got a hundred reasons why drinking would be a bad idea and no good reason to drink.  So I am not going to drink today. .

Not drinking with you today :)
I won't drink with today. I'm doing some projects around my house as well. Keeps me occupied and it feels great to get things done. 
Just one day. You've got this. Going back to zero would be crushing. Hang in there!
&gt;I thought that having many months under my belt ... would make it simpler.  Maybe it has but it's still not easy...So much this. While the sober time has made most things better I still have my days where I'm down in the dumps sometimes for no apparent reason. This is when I remember all things pass the good and the bad and all I have to do is keep not drinking one day at a time.
Congrats on your long term success so far! Don't throw it away for literally nothing. Also what flavor La Croix you sippin' on? I am jumping on this bandwagon as soon as I make it to the supermarket. 
You got this! Not drinking with you today have a good one! :)
