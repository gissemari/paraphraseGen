Hi all -- I have been lurking here for a while and known that I need to stop drinking for even longer.  After another two blackout weekend I realize that I need to quit.  Moderation is not going to happen...&amp;#x200B;..I spoke to my wife and committed to stop.  This is not going to be easy but I need to do this for my wife and our three kids.  The oldest is 5 -- he already notices everything.  I don't need him or our other kids knowing me as a drunk...&amp;#x200B;..Anyway wanted to introduce myself.  The stories of the people on this sub are a godsend to make me realize I am not alone in this struggle.  I just finished This Naked Mind and am a hundred pages into Allen Carr's book -- any other suggestions or words of encouragement are welcome...&amp;#x200B;..For the first time IWNDWYT.

Welcome!  I found Alcohol Explained by William Porter and Kick the Drink by Jason Vale to be very very helpful.  Those two books along with This Naked Mind really changed my mindset.  Having young children is the absolute BEST reason to slay the beast.  
I'm 10 days in myself. Go to an AA meeting. Just commit to go to one. Your wife doesn't have to go. 
You are not alone!!!
