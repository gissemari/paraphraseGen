I love you SD!  I cannot put into words how much I do. &lt;3..I've reignited my passion for life. I'm a completely transformed person. I've regained my confidence my relationships are flourishing and I'm in the best shape I've ever been. It wasn't long ago since the times I felt totally worthless had intense panic attacks and no one to turn to. No one except you! Thank you!..I'm never going back! Not a single drop until I drop...For all of you struggling   be patient. Sobriety is the best gift you can bestow yourself with. ..You've already planted the seed by joining this subreddit. Enjoy every moment of the process. From the fragile seed to the frail stem to the lovely branches...I'm still on my way to experience the flowers and the fruits of my sobriety so I can't speak of them...At least I'm not watering my "sobriety plant" with poison...&amp;#x200B;

Great job! 
So happy for you!

I think if the daily check ins keep you mindful of your goals that is enough. I did it religiously for a year and still do it from time to time. Use any tool any way you see fit :)
