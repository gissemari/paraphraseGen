Thanks for sharing that VE. It's inspiring to remember that we all had our day one and it was hard for most of us. It's especially inspiring to me coming from you because you've been such a beacon of hope ever since I started coming to SD. :-)
Thanks for the post! I found this hella interesting. Yeah I still say hella:-/
I remember those days and that thread. I came here about the same time under a different account before I decided to use my real name...FranksTV was asking for help because this sub was starting to take off. We just passed 400 members or so...It was really great to come back and see you doing so well.
It's like the VE time machine!  Wow pretty amazing.
Your time-machine reflects the unfolding of a life in recovery. Thanks for sharing.
Your post reminds me of this quote:.."The only time you should ever look back is to see how far you've come."..You've come a long way and should be very proud of your accomplishments.  Thanks for sharing. 
That was really interesting to read thanks VE.
Awesome thanks for posting this! It's cool to see how you were at 25
