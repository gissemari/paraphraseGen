I don't post often I'm more of a lurker but I'm hear nearly ever day...The last year has been hard the first few months of sobriety were always the weirdest. I struggling through the first two weeks to hit a stride for a month or a little over after only to think I could have "1 night" or "a couple of drinks" to find another 3-4 months of me basically being constantly drunk it would become so much apart of the "normal" me no one ever thought I'd fallen off the wagon that I didn't want to of course drinking buddies new...&amp;#x200B;..I did this quite a few times over the course of the last couple of years.  Sober up struggle hit stride drink....be drunk for a few months...repeat...&amp;#x200B;..This time I've managed to stay sober somehow over the course of the last 370 days didn't let myself even smoke pot and even avoided any pain pills I was prescribed when I was injured...neither of those things were ever my go to but for me it was just about eliminating anything that was altering whatsoever ..&amp;#x200B;..Well...370 days later I wouldn't say I'm immeasurably happier or anything but at least my moods are reliable and I know how to work with them instead of being a ***passenger*** to them...&amp;#x200B;..My diet at first was shit I gained quite a few lbs the first few months about month 4 I started working out a few times a week now its turned into 6-7 days a week and because of that I started to also watch more about what I eat and when I eat. ..&amp;#x200B;..I'm now back down to a little less than I weighed while drinking but the weight that is there is a lot more muscle my body doesn't feel so disproportionate anymore no big gut with weak arms far less puffy face thats always looks like its squinting into the sun...&amp;#x200B;..I got my finances in order....slowly.  And now at the age of 32 I just bought my first home in a great condo building in an amazing area in my downtown.  It's just a 1bd 1 bath loft unit but its MINE.  This was absolutely not in the cards for me EVER let alone this soon in my mind over a year ago NO FUCKING WAY.  Life is hard but it doesn't just revolve around a constant sense of impending and permanent doom the future feels like a future now not just a predestined set of movements as I age...&amp;#x200B;..I've lost contact with some friends and became closer to others...remarkably my best friend quit after trying off and on like I did around 8 months after me he's now nearly 5 months sober and I can see some changes in him even if he doesn't see them...&amp;#x200B;..Sobriety is absolutely the best choice I have ever made just for myself and my largest regret in life will always be not getting sober when I first realized I had a problem so many years ago that regret wont go away but I've learned to live with it...&amp;#x200B;..I still have a lot of work to do and there are days where my mouth and mind still water when I think about how nice it would be to just let it all go just for one night or one drunk but I've tried that before and...well it always always went horribly I don't think that will ever go away and thats something else I'll have to live with like someone with a disability you know its permanent so you adapt because you can't change...&amp;#x200B;..To anyone out there having a hard time or thinking of quitting or all those personal heroes of mine who's stories helped me we're all fighting a very personal battle together...&amp;#x200B;..Even some of you with your sickening optimism...&amp;#x200B;..Thanks everyone here and IWNDWYT!..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;..
