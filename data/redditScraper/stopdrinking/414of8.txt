Hey SDers ..I'm fairly new to this subreddit but feel like it's going to be a great motivator for me as I continue my second day of sobriety. I finally have said enough is enough. This past Wednesday I could have burnt the house down due to the excessive amount of alcohol consumed. It's been over two months since my last episode but this last episode was the last straw. I'm exhausted by the other me and what he has done to my life. I recently was hired at a firm where I finally can make a good living but I know if I don't sober up I'll soon find myself jobless. ..The struggle is REALLY hitting hard today. My GF of three years is breaking up with me because she's tired of dealing with my addiction. I'm staying as strong as I can but know that it'll really come at me later this evening and into the night. But I'm not going to let it happen. I'm ready to make it to day 3.
