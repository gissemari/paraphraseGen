I made it back into the double digits! ..Sigh... first big test tomorrow. An old friend's birthday party. Bringing her my stash of alcohol that I no longer can drink! Going to try to not be a boring drag. Sobriety is easy alone at home but I still don't know how to let my frustration and self hatred about not being able to drink like everyone else show... or how to mot constantly talk about not drinking which I am learning  WAY too late in this journey (I've been trying to quit drinking with steadily shorter relapses for like a year now) totally annoys and can isolate you. :( ..:(((((( .E

So what if you will be boring drag. At least you will be sober boring drag and not intoxicated clown. ...Watch the crowd how ridiculous they get with every drink. It won't be you. ...Stay strong and think about people with severe food allergies who have to watch what they eat. We are allergic to booze....Enjoy the party and IWNDWYT!
