Back to square one here I'm not too worried about any of the effects as to me they all come reasonably easy the two things I struggle with are falling asleep (this can be medicated) and night sweats.  ..There is NOTHING worse than waking up in the middle of the night and feeling as though someone just threw half a dozen buckets of water onto you and it's the only damn thing you can't control. I know it only lasts a few days or a week but it's so damned unpleasant.

I'm proud of you for sweating it out. The worst is almost over.

Yeah sweating it out sucks.  But maybe you can grow from this and learn to avoid it in the future.  
me too
Yes! I have the worst night sweats. I wake up with sweat behind my knees for god's sake. I freeze I'm pouring sweat and freezing to death. I hate it and I need this to be the last time. Just a few more days! Iwndwyt!
I'm only a couple weeks in so far from having a lot of time behind me. That said sleep is better and don't miss that stuff. As you know miserable stuff but you have to get through it there is no other option. But seriously it is better not having to deal with this stuff keep that in mind once you get to the other side of this. Truth be told none of us \*has\* to ever go through this again we have a choice. Easier said than done I get it but we can free ourselves of this if we ditch the drink.
Thanks for the reminder.  I'm on Day 1 again as well.  Ugh.  I usually try to arrange Day 1 onto a Friday so I can catch up on sleep but this time around that's just an excuse to keep drinking for another week.
