It's that time again!  The week's half over.  Time to share your triumphs and struggles...**Triumph**: Despite having a series of frustrations and negative things going on AND being in a situation that would have made drinking easy (I was at a hotel in a conference room with people that didn't know I quit drinking after losing in a tournament with free drinks).  And I didn't drink.  I made sure I was aware of the situation.  I made sure I was aware about how I felt about it.  I thought through how it would go if I did drink.  Then I proceeded to have fun hanging out with my tennis friends (some drinking some not)...**Struggle**: See above: series of frustrations and disappointments...**General Chat**: I want to stomp the crap out of my opponents in my tennis match tonight.  BOOM!..Have a great week!

Triumph:  2 weeks starts tomorrow and it has been fairly easy  Not a problem not drinking. Feel better about every aspect of my life...Struggle: Worried slightly about losing touch with people that do drink; but not worried about leaving my problem drinking friends behind...General Chat:  I wish this bootleg copy of godzilla would load faster.  Go Mariners! We are getting the broom out tonight against the Blow Jays.  Long drive home.
Triumph: just that I'm sober I guess??..Struggle: having some emotional/mental problems lately out of nowhere and I can't seem to do anything about them. Don't like myself very much at all. I miss just being able to take something and feel different

* **Struggle:** I'm kind of all deathed out. When I started unfucking my life foremost in my mind were three people. One had been murdered at 6 before getting any of the big Ws that life has to offer. One developed had just developed early onset dementia at about 60 and the third had at 22 gotten and at 24 beaten (we thought) cancer. So one was dead and one was terminal but the third had a shot at a long and happy life. I know it was irrational and I wasn't really hagning my hopes on it but the idea was that I would get sober/not obese and she would continue to live cancer free and I'd tell her one day that her strength had saved me from myself...  The dude with dementia died a month ago the girl with cancer had it come back and it took her on Saturday. I found out Sunday. I was talking to friends before a meeting on Monday and I said "I'm all deathed out." Maybe ninety seconds later we found out our brother in arms\* Robin Williams succumbed to this thing. ..* **Triumph:** Nice thing about a day at a time program: I know how to handle days. I can't honestly say that a day in sobriety has ever been a Bad Day the way I used to have Bad Days. My triumph is that I can walk through this stuff. I can go do the next right thing to make sure I take care of my mind body and spirit\*\* and still grieve at the same time. It's actually kind of amazing: the sad part of me is sad and that's OK. The part of me that likes working is at work and I'm engaged in what I do here. As another young dude in my home group has said a few times: **how I'm feeling isn't how I'm doing.** I feel crappy and I'm allowed to and I'm allowed to keep doing all the things that make my life better. That's OK...  Also more generally: fitness (both running and lifting) continues to improve counting nine days in Overeaters Anonymous even through Sunday and it bears repeating fucking sober...* **Generally:** New Run the Jewels record is mixed and new Hail Mary Mallon has a release date. Sober /r/hiphopheads get hype!..We are going to fucking make it.....---..&amp;nbsp; \* Mellodramatic sue me  .\*\* take this like "in good spirits" not "salvation of immortal soul;" I ain't about that.
**Triumph:** Just shipped off a good draft of a research paper to colleagues--10 days before the submission deadline! It did not want to be written and fought with me hard...**Struggle:** I've not been exercising properly the past couple weeks and I feel it...**Chat:** What is it with 5 year old boys and weapons? Apparently my attention span is not long enough and I give up on the battles before I am defeated.
Triumph: My exboyfriend has been out of my house for over a week now...Struggle: My exboyfriend has been out of my house for over a week now.
Triumph: happy about sobriety .Struggle: have hardly seen my toddler son due to work.General chat: I'm looking forward to my ebay purchases coming so I can do some hobby work 
**Triumph:** I'm registered for fall semester classes and I'm looking forward to them. I was debating whether I should take the semester off to focus on getting better but I know that keeping myself busy will help this early into sobriety. .....**Struggle:** The newness of sobriety is kind of wearing off and it feels like I'm hitting a mental wall...or maybe I'm just not ready for my summer to end......**General Chat:** I started rereading *The Wheel of Time* books again...it's definitely helping to keep my mind off drinking. Finishing up *The Dragon Reborn*. Any WoT fans here? (I forgot how great this series is!)
**TRIUMPH:** 5 days without a damn drop...**STRUGGLE BUS:** I'm thinking about it more than I thought I would. I remember going 2+ weeks without booze why is this time so hard? Also I got a free mason jar I won months ago....from Kraken Rum. Great timing guys....**GENERAL CHAT:** Kill La Kill is good but may not top Gurren Lagann.
TRIUMPH: 261 days booze free but 350 days cigarette free! So close to a year! Also I started working out this week and am feeling super motivated. ..Struggle: I still have cigarette cravings. Especially around dusk. They're easy to deal with though...General Chat: I made a nice chicken for dinner. Learning to cook without wine as an ingredient has been one of the hardest things for me in my sobriety. But now when I taste it in food I freak out. In the past I would've hosed that sucker in white wine but I used orange juice instead.
