I was doing really well but I started drinking again after having super anxious feelings about starting a new job. I couldn't cope and I've been drinking a bottle of wine a night since. I'm grateful for the timing of the relapse because it reinforces that my drinking urges are directly related to not wanting to feel my feelings. I'm going to Disney next week and whenever I think of Disney the wine witch pops into my head and convinces me I NEED alcohol on my trip. It's sad. You gotta be pretty addicted to think you need alcohol to have fun in Disney world. IWNDWYT
