Hi all and happy New Year's Day! I've lurked here for months but in the spirit of a new year I've decided to finally create an account and become an active participant. This community is important to my recovery -- I've read so many posts here that inspire me and I'd love to be of service to even one person in return. ...A bit about me:..- quit drinking in early September following ~3 years of increasingly severe alcoholism..- spent seven weeks at an outpatient rehab after quitting..- have shopped around plenty of meetings but am still struggling to find one I like..- am on my 120th day sober!!!...What's worked for me so far:..- recognizing that sobriety is not the magical solution to my problems. Instead it's the foundational tool I need to solve those problems myself...- meeting other people in recovery. Rehab is great for this and if you've considered checking into a program and have the resources to do so I highly recommend it. (Ask your doctor for referrals to good programs -- not all recovery centers are created equal!)..- viewing recovery as a holistic process. Meditation and long walks are key for my well-being...- accepting that what works for others may not work for me. Some AA'ers insist that AA is the only ladder out of addiction which strikes me as a dangerous misconception to spread. On the other hand many AA principles help me in my daily life (ex: surrendering to the fact that I can't control everything) so I tuck those values away for safekeeping and try to brush off what doesn't resonate...- being kind to myself. During active addiction I did plenty of things I'm not proud of but I also suffered deep personal pain and turmoil. As I get better I'm working hard to put myself first instead of letting work family or other stressors get me down. ..Thanks for being here everyone. Hope your 2018 is off to a sober clear-eyed start and I'll see you all very soon! IWNDWYT.
