At 90 days sober my life is full.  I feel as if 99% of my days are dedicated to my career my family my friends my home & pets &  most of all to trying to find balance.  When I relapsed I already had all of the aforementioned things but I lacked the ability to seek a meaningful balance in life.  Today was exhausting (husband is out of town so I had to drop the kids off at the babysitter's & the dog off at the vet to be spayed before starting my hour & a half commute to work- trust & believe I was exhausted by 8 AM).  A full life & all of the blessings & stressors that come with it are no longer reasons for me to justify drinking.  Today I find peace & comfort in sobriety & I'll keep working on the balance as I go.  Wishing a beautifully restful & sober evening to you all. :)

Way to go. You're an inspiration for me at four days and shaking.
I'm jealous. I really want to get to the place where you're at but I've still got quite a ways! (both with my sobriety and having a family of my own)...Your story helped me daydream of a better future. And I'm so happy for you!! Sounds like life is good :) :) 
Keep kickin away learning to swim again in sobriety is beautiful. 
Nothing is worth drinking for.  I'm really pleased for you.
That's a wonderfully inspiring look at life.  Ups down and all arounds.  Sometimes the best we can do is to just keep on doing what needs to be done.  Hope today brings some good things your way.
