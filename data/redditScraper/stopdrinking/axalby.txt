https://people.com/movies/ben-affleck-talks-alcoholism-jennifer-garner-parenting-today-show/amp/..Just had this article come across a news feed. It reminded me of a quote but I can't remember who it's attributed to. It's something along the lines of:.Addiction isn't a problem money can solve otherwise rich people wouldn't die from it. ..Remember that even the most successful rich affluent happy steadfast athletic and intelligent people can struggle with alcohol. It isn't a weakness you aren't alone in your struggle and there are so many others out there just like you that you can lean on.

True although if you are rich you are more likely to get the help you need like a 40 day rehab. But a proclivity to drink can affect anyone. ..It's good Ben is speaking out about addiction and lowering the stigma and showing that recovery is possible.
Alcohol is an Equal Opportunity jealous mistress cruel warden and merciless executioner...
Addiction doesn't discriminate. I remember Demi Lovato's story how she was sober for some number of years and then overdosed overnight. It's scary how you think you are recovered and one thing can cause a relapse and now you're back to square one. ..If you look up which celebrities don't drink alcohol there's a high number who are recovering alcoholics. It really is relieving to hear we're not alone in this. 
I got a lot of respect for him
