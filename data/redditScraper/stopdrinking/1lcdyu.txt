Don't drink today. I don't know when I will learn but I relapsed for a few days. Told my ex girlfriend I loved her (I will delete Facebook for real this time). I actually think I do but it's a bit late seeing as she dumped me 7 years ago. I don't think I ate yesterday. I got an odd cryptic text from my Dad so I'm not sure what happened there if anything. I was able to drink some water earlier but solid food is probably out of the question until tonight at the earliest...Just a friendly reminder to anyone planning a relapse. I was thinking about mine for a few days. It's so goddamn annoying to wait out withdrawals I have at least a couple of zombie days before I feel anything close to normal again...Anyway I have something like 50 sober days this year which is by far the most I've ever had in a year. I keep at it and hopefully it sticks eventually.

Sounds to me like you're making progress at least in the respect that you are capable of being honest with yourself.  If you have the capacity to be honest you have the capacity to recover.  Here are a couple of important equations to consider: don't drink + 0 = dry; don't drink + recover = sobriety.  In my experience those who work a program of recovery have a much better chance of real sobriety and freedom from this crazy "disease."
As someone wise once said *you didn't relapse you drank.*
