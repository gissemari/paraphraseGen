Another long daily entry writing is cheaper than therapy anonymous strangers are easier to share with than people in my real life and sharing helps me feel less isolated so I will be unapologetic about my long ramblings...Today two people asked me if I'm okay already both saying they've noticed a sudden a change in my state of being recently withdrawn. It's not even lunch time yet! One is an acquaintance from a study group someone who barley knows me. I guess I'm not doing as great a job as acting like nothing is wrong as I had thought...The truth is I'm not really okay. I had been feeling awesome better than ever after finally becoming free of a long stretch of depression and panic attacks that indirectly cost me my job. I was overconfident that those dark days were gone for good. I started feeling shaky at the end of last week. There are very few people who know just how dark and gone I was in the past probably only two people I'm comfortable talking about all the details openly with. When I realized I couldn't reach out to either of them for different reasons fear set in the feeling of total isolation and alone-in-this-ness (yes I'm making words up) the panic attacks started rolling in... First ones in a few months and I felt completely powerless over myself my emotions my life...It's shocking to me that I lived with that all day every day for so long it seems more intense when you're not living it daily than when it's your norm. I used to handle it so much easier than I am this time around now that I've gotten used to life without it...I'm not sure it would have made a difference even if the people I'm comfortable reaching out to were available. It's easy to look for things to blame your weaknesses on. Maybe my ego wouldn't have let me tell them I needed help that once again I was being defeated by this. There's something shameful about yelling "HHEELLPPP MEEE PPPLLEASSSE" right after you finished talking about how amazing you're doing how happy and peaceful you are finally. It makes it seem like you were lying even though it was honest in the moment you spoke it. Either honest or lacking self awareness on a deeper level...But I clawed my way out of this dark space in the past and I'll definitely do it a second time. I'm a fighter and I have a lot worth fighting for. I didn't have any panic attacks yet today and my day started 7.5 hours ago so I'll take that as a sign it will turn around sooner or later. ..I know this is an alcohol forum but it's so closely linked to mental health that I feel it's appropriate to reflect on the return of those emotional issues here and the role they played in my recent outburst. Being in an unhealthy mental space being terrified of what life has in store for you when you recognize those dark hands from the abyss pulling you under again it makes you weak. It makes you irrational. It can make the best people with the best intentions do crazy things they would never do in their "normal" state. Please if you know anyone who struggles with depression and panic attacks try not to judge them too harshly try to face them with forgiveness when they go off the deep end and act out. Engaging in irrational destructive panic induced behaviour is a hard thing to understand if you've never lived it yourself...So anyway I'm not trying to blame the times I drink in a destructive escapist way on mental health issues. It's still on me to learn how to cope and act in responsible non-hurtful ways when I'm unwell. Today I did realize though that my first out of control destructive drinking in a  long time coincided with my first panic attacks and bout of depression in a long time. Three days after I started having panic attacks again I got out of control drunk for the first time in several months. Sure I have had many drinks in recent times but it was mostly healthy good fun drama free drinking. Know your limits drinking. Go home and wake up not even hung over drinking. Very different from the self destruct drinking I did three days ago...I'm so thankful that this time around I'm taking a stand to break that cycle by doing things I've never done before like reaching out for support and openly discussing my issues related to alcohol through support groups. That's a victory I wasn't capable of this time last year. Even though I'm only day three I'm day three after only ONE bad night. This time last year I would have spiralled for months before I put the breaks on. Even though emotionally I still feel like a truck ran over my spirit  I've come a long way and I forgot just how far I've come in the past year it's typing this entry out as I think in this moment that I realized it.

I absolutely love your posts! It sounds like you are going through a lot of self-reflection which is amazing. Getting sober was a very reflective process for myself. It was a chance for me to prioritize things that were important to me my values get to know the real me Etc. I also realized I was a lot stronger than I thought...Like you my mental health is strongly interwoven with my drinking. I have bipolar and sometimes debilitating anxiety. I have to remind myself that anxiety is only a feeling it won't kill me and like all feelings anxiety will eventually pass...Keep up the amazing work!
