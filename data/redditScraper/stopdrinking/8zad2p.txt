Good morning! Just doing a quick check in..This is the longest stretch that I've gone without a drink in at least 15 years.  Passed my second sober weekend..This one was a little harder.  I went out for wings and saw that they offered O'Doul's NA.  Got all excited until I learned how carby that stuff is. (I gave up sugar and most carbs about 2 months ago.).But that's ok - there are so many other things to drink and enjoy! I've had all kinds of diet soda flavored water even a root beer float with sugar free ice cream.  It was delicious!.Also my sleep has been amazing I'm laughing and joking more energy is good and I'm down a few more pounds...Thank you SD.  Your stories are so inspiring.  I've learned that my struggles aren't unusual and are nothing to be ashamed of.  With the right mindset they CAN be overcome.
