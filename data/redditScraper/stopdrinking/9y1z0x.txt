( Nothing gets you out of a bad mood better then having it pointed it  )  But I cant think of anything that is causing it except that I've reached some point of being angry about my alcoholism. I've been on the sober journey for  year now. Few relapse in there but back on and determined. I want to be here. I play the tape forward. I see and understand the benefits. I love myself sober. But I'm angry. I'm mad that I can't drink normal. You know how people say f*ck cancer I feel the same way about alcoholism. Not as in f*ck it I'm gonna drink but f*ck I have this disease.

Are you near a city? I just saw a website for a destruction room place--they give you a sledgehammer and all kinds of implements of destruction safety glasses and a room full of plates and glass and electronics t.v.s and stereos and stuff to break.
