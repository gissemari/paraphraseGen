Pretty heavy drinker for the past 4 years.  I started elsewhere i own a bar and a restaurant with some friends and i let the drinking control me in regards to how i delay with stress...Now I'm a month in and I've had anxiety gor the past couple of years and i tend to let my thoughts get the best of me.  My blood pressure had been up and I'm on m3ds to help but I seem to always let the way i feel right now control how i actually feel if that makes sense...Something hurts must be something terrible (in my head).  I know ir took years to get where I'm at and that 1 month isn't going to be the fix 2hich is why this is permanent for me.  I'm just wondering if you folks wouldn't mind sharing how you felt and what your concerns were when sobering up.  .I feel very alone I'm this struggle and it's hard to describe my feelings to my wife because she means well but i also dont want her to know how bad the struggle is.  I mwa we talk about it and she's supportive but i know most of my feelings are irrational and i know she just spent get that because she's just in great health and has never really had a bout of depression or anxiety like i have ans part of me doesn't want to get her mind going down that road herself.  ..Anyways thanks.  Monday was a no the gor me and even though i feel spaced our at times and tempted I'm thankful every mowing i wake up sober.

My concerns were that using a drug to function wasn't sustainable and I had to find a new way to live.  Have you tried any groups like Smart or AA?  Support has been key for me so if not a partner to open up to maybe some like-minded people.
Going to AA meetings and a therapist gave me the support I needed. Relying on our close family members isn't really fair to them so I got help from people who understood alcoholism and how to get well. ..Sounds like you could use more support.
