A bit of background- .I've had alcoholic tendencies since 2010 and increasingly became a daily beer drinker (never touch liquor). The longest I have gone with out a drink in these 8 years is a 2 month stint at the beginning of this year and a two week stint this summer. Seems like both times I relapsed the habit only got worse. During the longer period of sobriety I felt that it was very easy after getting over the hump at about 4 days in- I was doing it for me and no one else and that's what made it seem simple. I am in my late 20's and still realize I'm young enough to turn it around but old enough to really age myself more quickly if the drinking continues and regret where it will lead.. Then one day at a social function at a local bike shop I was offered a free beer from a flowing keg. I stalled before finally accepting the drink knowing that it would lead to many many more- and it did. I was off the wagon and it seemed the relative ease of sobriety was nothing compared to the ease of always finding a way to slip away and sneak another beer. ..This time around I have different motives- I still absolutely want to do it for myself.  But I am also motivated more and more everyday by my young son who is just beginning to talk and I realize how much of a sponge he truly is becoming. I also miss seeing my S.O. smile at me- as that has become more and more rare as the drinking intensified and I tried to hide it (when she is pretty intuitive about my mind state). I feel this time around I am actually taking others into consideration with my sobriety- a realization that really helps me to be accountable as I am the type of person who doesn't like to disappoint others...Anyway today there was an event with a bunch of friends coworkers and community members in which we all biked around town to different grocery stores and bought food to donate to the local food bank. We collectively donated over 750 lbs of food and at the end of the ride the organizer announced that the next stop would be the local growler-fill station/beer bar that serves an awesome selection of regional craft beer- and to top it off everyone's first drink would be on the house and a dollar off every drink after that. Now if you know me you know that at this point I'm stoked. Not only did we just do an awesome thing for the community but now we get to get drunk and celebrate.  At only a week in this time around my mind still lights up at the idea of a free pint. I immediately looked at my S.O. and asked her if we should just head on home. She however wanted to continue on with the group (her a bartenter herself being very capable of limiting herself to a single drink) So we all rode to the bar (which is kid friendly go figure) Knowing that my S.O. thought I was going to at least get my free drink and buy 2 or three more I instead immediately just grabbed a water and went and played with my kid with the bucket of toys in the kidzone. It felt like a small victory but a lame one at that. Its just hard because I know that if it weren't for me being accountable to them I would have most definitely gone the route of 3 or 4 beers and socialized for a few hours with everyone. Instead she finished her drink and we biked home. What really threw me for a loop though was how she didn't seem grateful at all that I had abstained and was super quiet for the rest of the afternoon. ..I know that all in all I made the right decision. I feel that I am over the hump again where this sobriety thing is coming easy but man it just sucks when someone doesn't recognize the amount of willpower it takes and just give a simple smile or a 'thank you'. I also know I have no right to expect nor do I deserve such a thing when I have disappointed her time and time again.  Anyway rant complete. I will not drink with you today unless you are sipping on some rooibos tea right now. That I can get down with.

Getting praise for not doing something is kinda hard for people to understand. Especially if they are not an addict. ..I too had that yo-yo affect when I relapsed where I would hit it harder and longer. I'm determined to not do that again. ..I am proud of you for making the right decision. Keep up the good work. Soon you won't even need the praise it will just be who you are and what you do... a good dad. 
Good for you.  Truly brilliant.  .I don't know your full story but you know what actually happens to the SO?  They accumulate a HUGE amount of anger inside that they can't express.  So even though you did the right thing it will be a while before you get any comfort from her.  It was one of the things that always deeply scarred me inside that even after 50 -80 days without I would get nothing from my wife.  I now realise I have to expect it and fight it on my own for me her and the family.  But it is tough as it adds another burden to us while fighting the cravings.
