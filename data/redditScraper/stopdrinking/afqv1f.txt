He didn't think I could handle a 30 pack like I used to. Cocksucker.

I probably would not use the word Buddy for that guy.
It sounds like you may want to consider if this guy has your best intentions in mind. Good friends want you to be the best version of yourself and it doesn't sound like he cares enough about your recovery to support it. 
Good friends root for your success...not try to sabotage it!! IWNDWYT 
Six beers down the toilet.
What an idiot
I had a friend that drank a 12 pack per night and called me a "lightweight" and he thought that a 12 pack per night was well below any measure for alcoholism or even problem drinking. 
I'd stay sober just to spite him. 
wtf? I would be sincerely furious with this person and cut them off. Prove their ass wrong 
Maybe you should quit alcohol and this so called buddy in the package. 
That is so not OK. I had friends express all kinds of doubt in me for the first few months... but those "friends" I also had as little as possible to do with afterwards and focused my time and energy on the friends that really were cheering me on. I still don't socialise with the doubters and I don't miss that either. If anyone HAD given me any booze - for whatever reason _ I would have given it away pronto. If it came with the sort of negativity that six pack you were given had attached I'm just twisted enough to give it away to the person or cause that would most annoy the person who gave me the booze and make sure they knew. I can be a bit snarky like that lol. .
This person does not have your best interest at heart. Keep that in mind going forward.
You threw it away?
