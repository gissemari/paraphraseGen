I hate waking up from drinking dreams. I dreamt I relapsed at a party. The dream was so vivid. I even "woke up the next day" in my dream and knew I had to call my sponsor. It was a horrible horrible feeling. That feeling and "playing the tape forward" is what keeps me sober. So thankful to wake up sober. Keep on keeping on.

Those dreams do suck but there was nothing I could do about them. Instead I taught myself to relish the sweet relief when I woke up. It's like having a dream about being in school and not studying for an exam or not writing a paper that is due. I try not to be pissed off about the dream but be PROUD of myself for not drinking in real life!
I had one Saturday too. It was so scary! I even dreamt that I posted here afterwards and had to reset my badge. That made me so sad. Horrible. Thank god they were just dreams we had. 
I had a relapse dream last week. They suck. It motivates me though 
Yes! Drunk dreams really do suck especially combined with failing at work in the same dream. I'm a DJ so we call it the DJ nightmare where you're constantly messing up and failing in front of a packed club. Thankfully these only happen once in a blue moon but they are the worst!
