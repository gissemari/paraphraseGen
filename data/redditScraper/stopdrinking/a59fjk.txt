This is my fourth time actively abstaining from alcohol in the last 5 months or so. The longest I made it was 28 days and I'm ready to make it further this time. ..I told myself that I was going to stop smoking weed as well  but I think I was getting a little too ambitious to set myself up for success. So I'm going to focus on kicking the booze while I wean down the quantity of Mary Jane. ..If anyone here has some experiences with struggling to quit weed and drink I'd love to hear from you.

Congratulations on day tre! ..I don't think I could call myself WiseWizardofWeed and successfully wean off of it at the same time.  .It's smart to set one's self up for success....Here's cheering for you to stop drinking for a record- breaking amount of time!  .I will not drink with you today.
