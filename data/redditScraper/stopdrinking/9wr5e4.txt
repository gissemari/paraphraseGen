On day 2 again I made it past 7 days this last time relapsed for 2 days and back at it. This is 1 of many attempts for the last 5 weeks I keep getting back up and going again. Maybe it will eventually stick.

It will eventually stick.  Hell I've been trying since 2016.  I have had so many Day twos.  But I kept trying and here I am on day 141 which is the longest I've been sober for 11 years.  
You haven't failed until you stop trying.  I tend to believe that if you keep trying and learn from your mistakes you will eventually prevail.  However I also believe that you have to employ new methods tactics and tools after each failure.  You can't expect a different result doing the same things over and over again.  Some people consider that to be the definition of insanity.  Perhaps it's just wishful thinking and dogged stubbornness laziness or fear of trying something out of the comfort zone.  Nonetheless I think one should probably shake up their routine after each set back.  IWNDWYT.
