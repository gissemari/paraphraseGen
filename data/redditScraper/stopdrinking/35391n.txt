I've been here before but I'm starting again.  Below is my story and it's kind of long but nothing that most of you haven't read before.  I had to edit this to the past tense since at the time of this posting it has been almost 5 months since I changed my relationship with alcohol and 2 days shy of 90 days since my only relapse.  I am sure the community would have welcomed me back with open arms but I decided to not start posting right away after my relapse.  Anyway here I go.....I started drinking in college like many of you and having grown up in a very moderation oriented household I drank in moderation.  Thursday night was party night as most of us didn't have classes on Friday and it was great.  We would sit around watching movies gaming trying to pick up women and of course drinking some cheap college beer.  (For years I clung to the desire to go back to this the wish I could return to this point of moderation where I could have a beer with my dad and it be ok or where I could have wine with a nice dinner and be ok or where I could enjoy a company happy hour and it be fucking OK).  Later on Friday and Saturday became kind of the same way.  My last semester of school I had no classes left save one so I just sat around from dinner until I passed out sipping whiskey and playing Final Fantasy on the PlayStation.....After college I moved home for about 2 years because my first job was a half hour from my parents' house and they had this huge 4 story Victorian that 2 people couldn't even begin to occupy so I claimed the top floor as my territory.  I drank off and on but eventually had to stop in order to not be thrown out.  My grandfather on my mom's side was a severe alcoholic.  He cracked the seal every day at 3pm sharp until he passed out.  But he never drank before 3pm so he clearly wasn't an alcoholic.  He would get lit and piddle around in his shop mess with electronics work on the riding mowers and in general just do the man cave stuff of his generation.  He was a good man a good grandfather and his drunkenness was always the silly cheerful kind that at the time seemed harmless and even funny to a watching child.  He did it to stop thinking for a few hours a night.  To stop stressing and remembering and processing.  He did it to relax on a level he wasn't capable of without it.  I have only recently come to accept how very much like this man I am. @@.With the exception of a few weekend benders when I went back to visit my girlfriend in college I was dry for about a year before I got a few job back near my college town and left the forcibly imposed safety of my parents' home.  Before I even unloaded my suitcase I went to Safeway and got 2x 1.5 liter bottles of wine.  Basically from then on I have been a nightly drinker usually to the point of mild intoxication and at least once or twice weekly to the point of severe intoxication.  It has ebbed and flowed had breaks had a couple long breaks but all in all it has always been a big part of my life since then.....By 35 I drank 3-5 handles (1.5 liter bottles) of vodka a week.  I went out to the local pub with friends and neighbors and had a few drinks then when they went home I went home and dankk lots more.  And why did I drink?  Because it let me relax on a level I was not capable of relaxing on my own.  Because for those few brief hours it made me feel like the world was an OK place that I didn't need to worry about.  Work finances annoying family crappy commute and all those other little daily things everyone else seemed to be able to handle without a glossy booze filter I craved to dim with alcohol.  I just wanted my mind to shut the hell up and let me play video games or watch Food Network reruns for a while or play with new server geek stuff.  Shut up brain shut up?  No?  Then I'll shut you up buddy.  In other words I drank to not think and deal with things I couldn't seem to not dwell on so I can go piddle.  Just like my grandfather did.  It hadn't really registered with my wife of 2 years that it was a problem.  She came from a family of strict nondrinkers and hadn't seen anything that scares her like violence or puking on the floor etc.  I was never that kind of drunk.....I think despite the aforementioned dream of moderation and that beer with dad being OK; I finally came to the realization that Iwas and always will be a functional alcoholic.  I know that phrase gets a lot of grief but you know what I mean.  I got up I went to work I made the rent and paid the bills and took care of those that depended on me but when the day was over and it was  Relax  time that came with a bottle of liquid chill out.  Much like a lot of you I didn't  want  to stop drinking.  I loved my little piece of euphoria and not giving a shit about the world beyond mindless entertainment.  I loved my mind slowing down and just enjoying each moment alone or with my lovely wife.....But I also didn't want it to continue.  The scales finally tipped and I stopped.  For over 10 years I can honestly say that every negative thing in my life had been directly related to abusing alcohol.  Jobs relationships family stress money issues.  Every.  Single.  Negative.  Thing.  Had been tied to booze and it had to stop.  I have a great new job marriage and talk of trying to have our first child.  The rest of my life and everything else in it isn't worth that euphoria anymore.  I decided to find other ways to relax from the world.  Because at the end of the day I decided I could find a way to deal with the world without alcohol and I could face withdraw.  I could not however change what alcohol will do to my life if I continue.  October 25 2014 I decided to face it head on and give up alcohol.....Things were going well and to be honest I felt that first few days of righteous indignation after setting out on this quest.  I felt like I was almost blessed by god and empowered to get this done.  Things were going well until a couple of strong triggers happened in a short time.   It all came crashing down into one of the worse benders of a relapse of my life. ....I got back on the horse shortly after disgusted with myself but determined again.  This time around it was hard.  I had never felt withdraw like I did that time.  Maybe it was my body finally saying enough or maybe the off and on heavy drinking triggered something.  I don't know but what I do know is my body never felt so bad as it did after my relapse.  Sleeplessness horrible nightmares completely lack of energy headaches and shakes all of it.  It passed after a week but it wasn't over.  That relapse contributed to a job loss.  I wasn't happy with this gig at all miserable actually and the  who gives a shit  drunk/hungover attitude sealed the deal.  This time around was also different mentally and emotionally.  I didn't feel righteous blessed or empowered.  I felt like a soldier muddling through cold mud toward a goal.  Maybe it's that lack of comfort zone that made it work.  Friday will be 90 days and only 5 months total since I started this process but so much has changed it feels like 9 years since I last drank. ....I have a job now that I feel like was made for me and my wife and I moved about 20 miles further out of the city to a buzzing but much more chill suburb of DC.  I look back on my drinking time more than 10 years like a bad memory.  I don't feel a comfort zone with alcohol that is the first step toward falling down again but it's weird.   I feel a separation from it.  Like an ex or an old friend you fell out with when you see them much later on in public.  I can look at it see it and realize that once upon a time that was very important to me but now it feels like a stranger.  Like I said I know it sounds weird and almost wistful but it feels like so much longer than 3 months.  I take the one day at a time mentality but honestly it just feels like a part of my life that almost killed me but it didn't.  I'm sure it may have some long term effects.  I am determined to stay alcohol free and not allow it to ever control my life again. ....Not everything is positive now though.  I wish I could end this novella by pretending the camera was zooming out and I lived happily ever after but that's not the case.  I know it is not healthy to dwell on things you can't change but I feel like I lost my 20s and early 30s to drinking because I did.  I spent a decade operating at 40% of what I was capable of and now I feel like I am playing catchup.  I'm behind in my field and even though I love this job I'm working with people that are many years  younger than me at times.  I still do very well and am senior to them in many aspects but my skillset while advanced is a big brick of swiss cheese.  I have a lot to fix and a lot of holes to plug before I can get my career to where it should be. ....Because of my drinking and frequent unemployment and temporary jobs to pay the rent my parents helped me on and off a lot up until my early 30s even.  I am very ashamed of that but at the same time now I have to deal with a lot of anger toward them.  The fact I'm an only child already made our relationship intense but the fact they also had to help me so much and knew I was drinking has made our relationship difficult.  It is going to take them a long time to stop treating me like an over grown child and even when they stop that they are still clingy and way too involved.  My wife can't stand it sometimes and I'm going to have to start setting boundaries at a time when they are not going to feel I have any right too.   But I'm facing life sober for the first time in a very long time and I can deal with it....Despite the separated feeling from it I do get the occasional craving when something familiar with drinking triggers me a little.  But it passes very quickly usually.  I always remind myself of the years spent drinking and remember "Yeah that could make the next few hours really nice but after that EVERYTHING gets worse."..Thank you for reading....TL:DR Another long time drunk gives it up....
