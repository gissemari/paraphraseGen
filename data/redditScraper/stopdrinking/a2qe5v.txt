I'm so scared after relapsing. I've been shaking and sweating all day and my anxiety is at fever pitch. I can't believe that I did this to myself.

Sorry that you are suffering.  We are here to support you.  Stay strong.  IWNDWYT.  &lt;3
Relapses happen to the best of us. It is just some thing some of us have to go through. (Many times for myself.) ..All I can say is try to rest and not worry about too much right now. My anxieties would run wild if I let them. It's a new day and tomorrow will be better than today. Hang in there. Keep yourself hydrated! ..I will not drink with you today 
We're proud of you for all those sober days and especially happy you're hear after a slip up. It's ok let's stand back up and get right again IWNDWYT
