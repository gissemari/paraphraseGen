A girl in my AA group was really stressing about writing out her story so I decided I'd do mine and see how awful that was. ..My parents divorced when I was 3 my dad's been an alcoholic and daily pothead his whole life Just like his father and 3 generations before him. He (and I) are really wicked smart but he didn't really do anything with that after college. ..My first drink was when I was 16 at my birthday party. I'd grown up with quite low self-esteem and geographically isolated from my schoolmates. I was incredibly anxious about everything and loved the escapism that huge fantasy novels or NES games gave. When I had that beer I barely noticed the subtle way all that anxiety faded away and I just got to have fun and yell outrageous things...I didn't touch alcohol for another couple years but my cousins got me quite drunk at a family reunion. I was ecstatic. I tried lighting a cigarette in a campfire and singed my eyebrows off. I didn't drink at all in my first year of college (I was 18 in B.C.) but in 2nd year I started getting drunk with my friends on the weekends. Pitchers of beer. House parties in the summer where I'd get puking drunk on rye. Through the year in college I'd never ever drink during the week but I'd get puking drunk every weekend and spend most of it hungover. During the summer I drank as much as I could afford. ..The summer of third year I got a construction job at a brewery. I stole a 6-pack of fine beer every day and got drunk then came in nauseated and cranky in the morning. Somewhere in the middle of that summer I was out drinking with a cousin and at the end of a loaded night he got me four shots of 151 rum. I drank them all walked home crossing the highway twice in the middle of the night and got home and started chugging warm water and puking. I woke up the next morning (spoiler gross) on the floor of the bathroom with my pants halfway off full of crap and a brown handprint and streak on the wall. There were 5 ways I should have died that night. My family was out for a camping trip or something. I managed to clean up before they got home but was sick all the next day anyway. I don't talk to that cousin anymore. ..This didn't prevent me from drinking heavily on the weekends and daily when I was out of school for the summer until I graduated. Electrical Engineering / Comp Sci was _hard_ and really stressful. I used it to relax to enjoy myself to party. Finally I graduated and immediately started drinking every day. After all I wasn't in school right? All I had to do was show up to work. I got a job doing just what I wanted to be doing had no problems finding a girlfriend but work got more and more frustrating and difficult. My rage and anxiety would pile up and I'd leave early and go home and drink. My manager treated me like shit and the day that I resolved to talk to his manager about it (and finished a big project) I was fired. That was two years out of school. I'd just (a month earlier) proposed to my girlfriend. We moved in with her family. ..Six months of unemployment had me drinking rarely but intensely. I was so depressed I couldn't get out of bed some days. I finally took a job doing tech support for tax software on a six-month contract and finally I could drink again. I started drinking at lunch on workdays. My depression became bipolar disorder and I started oscillating between a week or two of pure manic energy and sleeplessnes and a week or two of crushing depression. After 4 months of this humiliating depressing work I got a call from a large software company for an interview and many many phone interviews and 2 trips down for in-person interviews later I got that job. making twice what I'd made in my first engineering job out of school. I'm still there. ..My drinking only accelerated after getting that job. My nightly 3oz martini quickly turned into two then three then with pot added on top. I stopped riding my bike and rollerblades and went to the gym less and less often. The new job seemed awful too irritating and stressful and for some reason depressing. I hated everything .about my life and felt trapped. The one good thing in it was that the girlfriend I'd proposed to was now my wife but our relationship got more and more strained and distant. She started stress-eating and gained 50% more weight. I trashed my wrists staying up all night drinking and playing WoW. I couldn't drive or play video games .or do any of my other hobbies besides. All I could do was drink. At this point my dad called me to borrow several thousand dollars then disappeared for 3 years. My sisters and I assumed he'd died drunk in a ditch somewhere...I bounced around in the big software company from group to group with my drinking creeping up and up.  I had a splitting headache every morning for the next 6 years. ..Somehow after 3 years I got promoted. I hated what I was doing it wasn't anything like the technical wizardry of my hobby coding. I started doing the hobby coding at work. I played WoW and EvE Online at work. I started drinking at work keeping a company-branded paper coffee cup of wine at my side in my office at all times. I .switched to a much more ambitious and technical job in a very competitive group thinking it would be a stepping stone up and out. Suddenly I couldn't keep up with anyone else my boss was constantly verbally abusive and told me (among many other vicious things) that this job was my last chance in the company. I stopped getting .raises and his performance reviews of me were filled with lies. I was incredibly resentful bitter jaded jealous and depressed. I drank more (at about 12-15 drinks per night now on weeknights more on weekends) and decided I had to cut down. I didn't want to quit. At this point I thought I'd inherited my father's crippling General Anxiety Disorder and depression and that I'd been treating it with booze. I finally overcame my paranoia of the stigmatization of psyche meds and asked my doctor for anti-anxiety drugs and he started me on Buspar...I spent three years on varying levels of buspar which sedated and dumbed me down but helped me at least cut my drinking down to only a six pack per night most nights. I struggled to pare that to 4 beers. I eventually got my drinking down to the point where I had months-long stretches of white knuckled sobriety. My wife now had a B.A. in Psychology was working on her Master's and urged me to go into therapy...At this point my wife had stomach surgery. Right after she'd recovered from that (a long nauseous slog) she started having Multiple Sclerosis attacks. The first one had her half-blind and unable to walk type or bathe for weeks. I maintained sobriety while she was awake always. Only when she was asleep would I let myself have a .maximum of 4 drinks. She was incredibly depressed. She got almost all of her dexterity and vision back and right away I blew a disc in my lower back and the two of us were living in mortal fear of both of us losing the ability to walk at the same time. I was 32. I started getting acid heartburn every day from drinking and took Prilosec for it. I got incredible pain in my abdomen and was checked out for pancreatitis. My stool was pale grey for a few months. My liver enzymes tested as slightly elevated and I got scared...I started CBT. I struggled to keep my drinking down to at most 50% of days and experimented with moderation. It was always eventually a failure but at least I was averaging only one drink per day. Within a year I got my self-esteem back and after another year quit the job with the abusive boss and moved back to my old group who were happy to have me back. I started coming to /r/stopdrinking and met some fellow drunks who are now the moderators. . At this point I was hiding all of my drinking from my wife. In my first year in the new group I got the 15% raise that I should have gotten the previous year. My new boss was awesome even if half of the team were back-stabbing shits. I actually started to enjoy my work. I started working through the couch-to-5k program...That brings us to a year ago. The product I worked on got moved to a team in India and we all had to find new jobs. I landed an interesting one in a group with a great culture working on and with tech that I'd been hobbying with for years. Stressful ramp-up has had me working late and weekends...And for some reason my drinking has crept back up. I've been sober for a week or so at a time then I'd buy a 26oz bottle and work through that in 6 days then 5 then 4 then 3. My wife only caught me once and I had to admit that I'd been drinking in secret. I've been so ashamed each time I've slipped. I've let her see me drink small amounts - like a single bottle of beer - then crept off to video games porn and vodka. Last night I'd made a week sober for the first time in months then rationalised my way through 13 oz of gin. The splitting headache from that lasted most of today. I poured the rest of it out and made a plan to keep myself from slipping again. I must not fail. I don't want to spiral back down. ..Thank you for reading. This turned into a novel. I guess I had a lot to say. (Also whoah two hours).-edit- formatting

Thanks for sharing and stick to your plan.  You have a lot going for you!
I read this and sensed how alcohol has woven itself into the fabric of your daily life. Now you're seeking to unweave it and that's hard. What are your plans for getting support while you do this? ..Good luck and thanks for sharing this.
