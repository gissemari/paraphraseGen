Since my last relapse I have had no desire to drink. Prior to the last relapse it was a battle at times. Persistence has paid off after multiple day one's. I'm by no means cured and I realize a craving could pop up at any time. I am still staying vigilant and listening for that little demon bastard to try to trick me! ODB

Lol be ready for that little demon bastard this time and don't let him trick you! Way to go on 27 days! You got this! IWNDWYT
That's great! Glad you know to not get complacent well on your way to being just an old bastard instead of a drunk one! 
Not easy but doable don't give in 1/1/2019 30 yrs anniversary stay strong
