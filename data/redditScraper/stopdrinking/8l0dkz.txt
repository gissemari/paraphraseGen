Recently started dating again and met a beautiful girl I want to be with all the time. Our typical hangout involved a beer or wine - and despite my best judgement I didn't argue against it. To some extent I was too ashamend to bring up my addiction issue. It was fine for 2 weeks even though I've noticed that I'm drinking more and more - but never to the full blackout point.  Like 2-3 beers or equivalent.  .Yesterday I even had a talk with my gf about not drinking during dates - and she was completely onboard with it.  .But for some reason right after we've had this talk I just had to go and "reward" myself..I've gotten 200ml bottle of shnaps and a tall boy to "relax" and went home telling myself this is not that bad - I'll just chill and be semi ok tomorrow. But of course after 1 hour of drinking this wasn't nearly enough so I drove drunk to a package store and picked up 2 nips and a 6pack on top.  .I puked all night and this morning I feel like shit and will probably have to call out sick today.   .Just another proof to myself  -  I cannot just become social drinker if I'm an alcoholic.

I can feel that one--like I just told my girlfriend/boyfriend we shouldn't drink on dates anymore she/he says Yeah Totally and now I'm like Oh Shit What Have I Done. It sounded good in my head but now I'm trapped!!..I think you really do have the right intentions and you did do the right thing in broaching the idea but you're falling in love and you got thrown. Happens to the best of us. Dating is tricky when we are simultaneously rebuilding our own psyches but she seems supportive and if she's as great as you say telling her may be the thing that allows you to reconcile the two. If there's potential there trust and sincerity about real stuff which is what happy relationships are made of would be a great foot to start off on too.
I know just how you feel I think everyone here does. Alcohol is a consistent source of frustration and pain for many people and the temptation to relapse is still just as constant ..But hey you're here now owning up to your fuck up and I hope that allows you to forgive yourself faster and move on to an even longer path of sobriety.
