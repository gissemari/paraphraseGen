It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-----------------------------------------..**Struggle:** Recently I was the target of some passive aggressive behavior. My mother who has not had a drink in several months ever since she got blackout drunk and injured me during a drunken accident poured herself a glass of wine at a dinner party while laughing and telling our guests  Mary is going to kill me for this. ..**Triumph:** I have been a milquetoast all my life but in sobriety I am learning to be assertive. After dinner when our guests had left I told my mother that when she inured me physically she had crossed a line and that I had to protect myself. Of course she threw my own past drunken behavior in my face and also claimed that my injuries hadn't been *that bad* but I wouldn't take the bait. Instead I simply told her that she was welcome to get drunk again if she wanted to but that she had to tell me in advance because I wouldn't be here if she did...**General:** My new personal motto:  I can only please one person per day. Today is not your day. Tomorrow is not looking good either. .
----------immediate responses--------

I can only imagine how difficult it must be to have to stand up to your mother like this. I applaud you for being so strong. Thank you for sharing your story. And I really appreciate your general at the end of this post.
I applaud you for standing up to your mother. I'm slowly learning to stand up to my father and build healthy boundaries around his controlling-anxious behavior as well. I love the new personal motto...**Struggle:** Career stuff I suppose. I went on a run yesterday and I was just hit by wave after wave of harshly comparing myself to others people younger than me and feeling like a gigantic failure. Trying to meet a goal/deadline today. Want to practice being kind and curious. ..**Triumph:** Sobriety. 41 days. Every day is precious to me. My relationship with my dad is staying stable and healthy. ..**General:** Monkeys have been eating my hard-grown eggplants and bananas. I'm a bit irritated but looking into ways to prevent it. There's a [beautiful new dog](https://www.reddit.com/r/woof_irl/comments/ae3kb5/woof_irl/) hanging out in my garden and his name is Gundappa and I love him. 
Mary that sounds very insensitive of your mother.  I think alcohol can frequently blur the line between humor and cruelty well not blur so much as just totally mistake them for one another.  Good job standing up for yourself!..**Struggle:** I am angry too often.  Like 90% of the time I'm around my husband. I try to address the issues at home with the messes and the lack of caring or effort by others but it just reverts back to BS in no time.  I feel like I can either be a taskmaster or go crazy.  ..**Triumph:** I'm seven months smoke free 2 weeks sugar free and lost 1.5 pounds since Christmas.  Not much but moving in the right direction. ..**General:**  Security Is Mostly A Superstition. Life Is Either A Daring Adventure Or Nothing.    Life Quote By Helen Keller
I'm 8 days clean and sober today ..Struggle - insomnia I've really been trying to establish healthy habits in my life but it's been really hard with my sleep out of whackit's taking me until 4 or 5am to get to sleep then I'm not getting up until midday..Triumph - I'm still keeping up with a few things on my list and everyday sober is a triumph and everyday I put effort in yo improve is a triumph ...
I am also on 8 days down...Struggle: Trying to balance everything in my life. That has led to the frequent drinking in the last few years (to pretend everything I need to do isn't there of course it is always waiting for you in the morning).  Yesterday I spent the day at home (took off work) to finish ANOTHER round of changes to my dissertation and by 5 PM I wanted to go to my favorite restaurant  drink a few glasses of wine and read a romance novel. I was DONE working on that dissertation.  ..Triumph: I ordered Chinese  went grocery shopping while I was waiting for it got food for today to take to work came home and got back to work on the revisions.  I submitted them this am...General: I need to fit in exercise.  My carefully crafted training plan is still sitting idle...
I really like that motto /u/sfgirlmary ! I might be borrowing that :)..*struggle* the combination of stress on stress and prolonged heatwave means I am STILL really tired and I keep bugging myself about not being enough fun for Kiddo because it's summer school holidays and I think I SHOULD be more fun more consistently. ..*triumph* just did some dancing with her - a few weeks ago finally set up a CD player near the kitchen and popped on one of my favourite world music CDs to keep me company while I did the kitchen schtick. Dinner might be running late as usual but we DID have a fun moment there in a pause in the prep and dishes process. Re-learning to dance spontaneously without being wine-inspired is a Good Thing...*general* the scary scary guy who has had me and a bunch of other local women terrified appears to have left town [or been done in by his convicted murderer lady friend he was living with around the corner from me] the sense of RELIEF is profound. It's a bit like when I first stopped drinking and suddenly nothing felt as awful or as hard - a pink cloud revisited kind of space. Hopefully he is never seen in these parts again..  
Thanks mary...Stay strong!..Struggle: I had set a goal to stop smoking on 1/1/19 and did not make it. Harder for me than stopping drinking. I think it is because the downside of alcohol was so apparent. ..Triumph: Slowly but surely tapering on the smokes. From 2 packs/day in early Dec. to 5-10 now...General: Seed catalogs coming in the mail have me excited about spring. Hope mild winter continues so I can get an early start. ..Peace
I no longer have peak hours that I'm functioning (usually 12-6-ish).  I am on from wake-up to bedtime.  I can also make appointments without scheduling them around my drinking or miserably trying to abstain so I don't show up hung over.  My first thoughts of the day are 'what am I going to do today?' instead of 'when am I going to start drinking?'.  Loving this life!  IWNDWYT!
Kudos to you! 
**Struggle**: I have exams this month so my only struggle is trying to motivate myself to study! ..**Triumph**: Sobriety makes managing my life a lot easier. I was trying to force myself to study from 9-5 but I'm not a morning person and it's been hard so I've been getting down on myself. But yesterday I realised that I actually have evenings free so why am I trying to study early in the day when I don't like it? So now I'm studying later into the evening. I think this is a remnant of when my days used to end at 5pm when I picked up a drink... but that's not happening anymore so now I get to rearrange my days and maximise my night owl tendencies :)..**General**: Back to the gym back to eating healthy I'm so happy that the holidays are over and temptations aren't everywhere anymore. Feeling much more stable! 
Struggle: Dreamt I drank last night!..Triumph: It was just a dream. Phew!..General: 8 days AF and I'm sleeping like the dead. It's like my body is trying get to heal itself or something? Anyhoo I'll take it. 
Mary I really need to adopt a motto like that. I think being such a people pleaser is why I struggle so much at my job. ..**Struggle:** As usual work. There aren't enough hours in my day to do all of the tasks and things to keep my staff and the agents who work in my office happy *and* get all the things done that our owners who are in another state want. ..**Triumph:** I did get over 100k steps on Fitbit last week in spite of it being a bitterly cold January here in MN as usual. Lots of time in the gym lately too...**General** Did I mention it's really freaking cold??? I know it's winter in Minnesota but it never ceases to amaze this native Texan. 1F/-17C right now with windchill that makes it even worse. 
Struggle - Ive been off of work for a couple weeks for the holidays which typically isnt a bad thing but when I have down time I start to think too much.  I think about life meaning and whether the life im living is worth it.  This sends me into a depression and I pretty much isolate myself from everyone and everything.  When im gone for work which can be for weeks at a time im constantly busy and distracted.  Not only that but i also feel fulfilled and accomplished.  I train a lot of different people in what I do and like to think I do pretty well.  I almost always get along with anyone I work with.  I feel like two different types of people whether im gone for work or at home.  I want to be better at creating this kind of fulfillment in my home life...Triumph - I dont know the exact date but ive been sober from booze since sometime in May.  Although I did pick up a weed "habit" for about a week last month since it's now legal and ended up realizing it's just not my thing...General - You guys should try using peanut butter in more of your recipes.  It can be versatile.
Wow this was excellent for both you and your mother. Don't worry she is thinking it through with a comment like that. Don't have to repeat it. Just do like you say--the best for both of you. BRAVO.
Well day 201 is in the books looks like I didn't get the 200-day yips and held it together...**Struggle:** One of my wife and I's goal for 2019 is to become a little more fiscally responsible which included life insurance.  As someone who has suffered from depression anxiety and alcoholism getting life insurance of any sort has proven difficult.  The insurance people are vultures and I was rejected my first go around...**Triumph:**  Instead of wallowing in my own self-pity and getting all pissed about it I posted on here and got it off my chest.  u/throwaway11192018 reminded me that we aren't here for validation or even a cookie.  We have to be doing this for ourselves or we won't make it.  It was hard to read their comment at first but I did read it a couple of times and the message sank in.  After the post I got back on my horse and went a different route for insurance.  I have a broker who specializes in not so pretty pasts looking into insurance for me.  I'm really glad I was able to break the negative chain and refocus...**General:** I'm going to Vegas on the 22nd I'll be there until the 23rd.  I'll be there with work and it's their yearly sales party.  I am going to have to use all my resources to survive Vegas sober.  I think I'll just go up to the barkeep and ask for the "prettiest NA drink" they have.  Should hold off the drinkers for a while :)
**Struggle** Went back to work and although I am super thankful to be working there it's still a struggle after two weeks off lol. Currently working to cut out negative people and stand up for myself which again although is a good thing it is really hard. ..**Triumph** Digging through the mess that is my head and actually ~~may be~~ **am** making some progress. I've been making progress towards a daily routine. Being forcefully kind to myself...**General** Keep it up everyone!
Struggle :  I keep putting off gym classes.  I feel great after I go but I just keep saying.... I'll go tomorrow. Lies lies lies!.Get it together goat!!!!..Triumph : I start my first day volunteering at my local animal shelter today.    Basically I just get to play with the cats as long as I want too.  Very therapeutic for me.  So a win win for us both.   ..General : I'm doing good.  I am proud of myself. Never thought I would be this content sober.  I still have my moments but I manage them. 
**S:** Da Bears.  Fifty degree change in temps.  Daughter kicked me in the knee...**T:**  Got my professional license.  Finally!  I was kinda starting to think I was never actually going to get it...**G:**  My mom had that sign in our kitchen growing up.  Pretty much sums up my childhood.
I'm almost at one week which is huge and it's a relief...Struggle: I need to get off antidepressants and I'm scared to. I'm on my fourth different med due to side effects I can't stick with SSRIs. I get horrid headaches and tremors. My hands were shaking so hard this morning I couldn't hold the bannister on my stairs. Frightening but I have to find new ways to manage anxiety...Triumph: does adulting count? Like actually waking up making lunches for the kids showering brushing teeth folding and putting laundry away? I'm doing that stuff again and the house 7.02% less messy than usual...Also I tried a new sport this weekend and I'm hooked and feel motivated to actually get up and exercise again.
What an uncomfortable scene with your mother. Good for you for being clear calm and confident about your boundaries. I also like the motto and will undoubtedly borrow it!..**Struggle**: Overwhelmed financially due to an unexpected situation that necessitated me taking out a large loan to resolve; the debt is taking a toll on my daily life and marriage...**Triumph:** Annual evaluation time at work and my boss checked "exceptional" on every assessment criteria. ..**General**: Holding steady in my chaotic world.
**Struggle** - a little scared of what is actually a fantastic opportunity for me it's a fair way out of my comfort zone but a tremendous opportunity. I'm really having to put a brave face on to embrace it I know it's something I want to do and will do but there's a part of me putting off the work I really need to do to be properly prepared for it. Hell even me writing this here is part of the procrastination I'm doing today  ..**Triumph** - went to a wedding at the weekend and threw the fuck down on the dancefloor! Really went for it and had a blast. Felt like a big moment to lose my inhibitions that way. And met a girl kissed her had a first date last night 2nd date scheduled for next week  ..**General** - been having a lot of dreams lately about slipping up. I do worry that I'm getting a bit blas  about things like journaling etc but I don't feel like I'm in any rush to have a drink so I don't know why I'm having these dreams. Really annoying that there isn't an app like Quit That! on Android - that was perfect for me the ones I've found and used aren't quite the same. Not the end of the world but a bit of a pain! 
Good for you Mary. While I can't relate to the drunken accident part I can relate to being infantilized by my mother and it's maddening and causes me to resent her which is sad because I otherwise love my mom.  ..What's upsetting to me is the lack of respect from the parent towards their adult child as if they're still "overreacting" (your "injuries weren't that bad" she says) as if you were throwing a tantrum like the five-year-old that they still see (not all parents but definitely mine). ..It sounds like alcohol is (obviously) the big factor here as perhaps your mother wouldn't have made that snarky comment about how you "were going to kill her for this"  or thrown your past behavior in your face if her inhibitions hadn't been lowered by drinking but it sounds like your mom is putting up every wall of defense to protect herself from turning inward to observe her own behaviors. ..With that being said you probably already knew all this due to your motto which I love. 
**Struggle**: last week my wife admitted to racking up $27000 in credit card debt which she had been hiding. In fairness I had my own little debt of $7500 or so that I'd kept private. Now everything's out in the open and we need to make significant lifestyle changes to overcome this. I'm bummed because I have to give up my nice car with leather seats and drive around an old car with 130k miles on it. And to be honest I'm really stressed out an anxious at times thinking about how we're going to struggle for 3-5 years to get out from under all this debt. But I'm hopeful this will be a positive thing for our relationship and that we can break out of such a consumerism mindset...**Triumph**: I got through a week without alcohol and lost a few pounds. I'm getting 1-2 hours more sleep each night. And although it hasn't been rosy at home my wife and I are at least on the same page and committed to solving our financial issues...**General**: I'm getting on a plane today for the first time in two years for a work trip. I know I'm going to be surrounded by alcohol and will be very tempted. I'm also a little nervous about flying so I've been dreading it. But I'm hoping I can stay strong throughout...&amp;#x200B;
Struggle - work getting up in the morning on time and feeling about 0 motivation to get things done and do them well. I'm feeling stuck and discontent with my life and I feel like I need to make some big changes. ..Triumph - I ran a mile in under 14 minutes on Sunday. Not a big deal to some but I couldn't stop grinning for an hour afterwards. I'm really excited to start getting my body into shape and I'm working towards a 5K right now and maybe in the future a half marathon. Nothing gives me a high like running does! ..General - I'm honestly not doing too good. I feel like I'm struggling in many areas in my life and I feel so tied down and stuck. Really wanting to break free from my routines and get myself on a better path. Being sober has been really hard and I don't feel a ton of support from anyone besides my mom. 
Passive aggression is terrible - happy to see you handled it well...*Struggle* Not much but I have trouble managing my time - my bullshit job takes so much energy. Don't know how to change it my family depends on it. Overwhelming responsibility was (is...) a drinking trigger for me but I manage it...*Triumph* Got a summary from my running app. Since I stopped drinking I'm faster without any effort. I use my would-be drinking money for a personal trainer now this coming year. ..*General* Sober life is a blessing. My wife and I are closer I no longer disappoint her and I can take care and be present with my kids. My life is in a place I never thought I would find myself. General anxiety levels are way down almost non-existent. 
**Struggle:** Being disciplined about everything other than drinking is tough. I mean the drinking part too. And I know some people say "eat all you want as long as you're not drinking you're succeeding" but in order to continue managing my fitness goals I need to eat well to support that and in order to continue living my lifestyle/standard of living I need to manage my fitness to support that so it all ties together. I can't just eat pizza and ice cream every day and it's really hard to NOT when nobody is watching. ..**Triumph:** I've just started my third month of Crossfit and I'm really enjoying it. Don't get me wrong - there are good days and bad days of course but the community and atmosphere makes me want to keep going and it really excites me to be working on my strength for the first time ever (I'm a natural at running but when I started I couldn't even do one knee-pushup let alone a "real" one). Really excited to have finally found a workout routine that seems to work for me and that I'm excited to do every day and I know it's going to feed into my other goals and discipline...**General:** I'm making progress. Now to try and put all the pieces together.
Struggle: decided to smoke weed for the first time in a while last night. Huge fucking mistake. Besides craving it hardcore now I had an absolutely horror experience. I went too deep in to my own head and feel like I fucked up a lot of the mental health progress ive made. I started to dissociate. Had some mild audio and visual hallucinations. Ending up questioning every relationship I have and seriously started questioning my own identity. I temporarily lost my sense of self and experienced some horrible paranoia. Now I just feel all shaken up and cant move past my experience last night. Like I've broken something inside myself...Truimph: I enroll ed back in school last semester and did really well. Im going back in the spring semester and I'm really excited for it...General: Been getting really in to the HBO show Girls lately. I just love it so much and really wabt to talk about it with someone.
Struggle: My partner is an opiate addict who has relapsed (I have no addiction issues with opiates). I am doing my best to support him but the cycle of promises to get clean putting it off due to fear of withdrawal not to mention the money spent on a daily basis are wearing on me. If anyone has experience with being a support person to an opiate addict I would love to talk to you...Triumph: today is day 9 sober from alcohol and cocaine. Taking it one day at a time but feeling better and better every day! ..General: I signed up for a car sharing service so I can go on sober adventures. It's nice to know I can do activities that don't revolve around drugs and booze and I will always be able to drive
I'm on day 8 with the intention of completing my first dry January...Struggle(s)- insomnia.  And I can't help but wonder why I'm doing this.  I feel like I'm on a quest to finish my 30 days and already envision myself enjoying wine again in February.  Trying to stay focused on the day but it's hard not to play it forward be that for good or bad...Triumph- gave a public presentation for work yesterday.  I nailed it probably partially in thanks to sobriety.  And I didn't even celebrate with a drink afterwards!  
One week. A tough week. ..**Struggle:** Loneliness and a lack of energy. It gets dark so freaking early where I live and dawn isn't until 7:30 or so -- 15 and 1/2 hours of darkness. And my husband is gone for an extended period and most of my friends are drinkers so I'm trying to avoid them. ..**Triumph:** I've got a good exercise program going and have been practicing Spanish every night - I've always wanted to learn it (the language of criminals drug dealers and rapists ya know!). ..**General:** I'm going to try harder to keep my energy up in spite of the seasonal blues (I bought a happy light btw.) and explore some more creative endeavors like writing and drawing. ..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;
**Struggle**: I used to drink to appease my appetite and managed to stay at the same weight perceived as conventionally healthy most of my drinking years. At two months of sobriety I weighed myself and had gained 10lbs (the most quickly I have ever gained weight in my life) and haven't had the opportunity to check now that it's been 3. I don't believe I look much heavier - I think my face actually looks the same and that alcohol had bloated me to appear the weight I am now but I am disturbed at how quickly I gained the weight. Feeding myself intentionally and joyfully TAKES SO MUCH TIME and ATTENTION and DISHES (no dishwasher). I know I'm finally dealing with my need to feed myself and take care of myself but I sigh knowing that eventually I'm going to have to pull back on how I'm eating just like I had to address how I was using alcohol. Is it a problem for today or is it a problem for later?..**Triumph**: I've been getting a lot of "Go" signals in areas where I infer meaningful symbols and January has been full of GO in such a beautiful way (including a complete change of plans for the next few months which feels much more in alignment). On top of that I am writing a lot and have a group of fellow writers who I meet with. It's such an incredible space and as we build greater trust I'm hoping I can bring my journaled essay on drinking to the group to share but also feel like I shouldn't ask them to hold space for it because it's raw and a downer and like too exposed...**General**: I adore this Thich Nhat Hanh meditation from "Peace is Every Step." I started using it before I stopped drinking but it continues to serve me. I hope you like it too...&gt;Breathing in I calm my body..&gt;Breathing out I smile. .&gt;Living in the present moment..&gt;I know this is a wonderful moment
Struggle: sexism is alive and well with some of my co workers. Had a frustrating meeting where I was mansplained and not taken seriously/listened to/believed even though I have been doing what I do very successfully for 15 years. I just want the same respect and deference to experience/wisdom/expertise that I give others. Fucking frustrating. ..Triumph: Sobriety is lifted a fog in my heart mind spirit and life and I'm seeing everything with clarity. The good. Bad. And the ugly. I'd rather live in the truth than the fog. So much self discovery and I'm excited and thriving. ..General: been doing yoga daily for months now and am doing another 30 day yoga challenge and loving it wholeheartedly. I've got muscles now! Woot!
**Struggle:**  Number 1: My day count keeps disappearing.  I am 10 days behind Whoopie I think so today would be 361. Why does it come and go? Number 2:  The slow pace of the great divestiture adventure. We can see what we've done finally.  Today - Some china some costume jewelry.  Hallmark research. Pattern research. Designer research.  I just want to pitch it all... **Triumph:** Ticking off the health maintenance items. Eye procedure done new shingles vax flu shot and today the dentist.  ..**General:** SO has been invaluable in the great divestiture adventure both in encouraging me to git 'er done and in the patient finding of all the tiny marks.  We're balancing work this week with fun this weekend.  
I want to quit.I know life is great .with out vodka but fuck I need it .AA is for people who have faith 
Yay not drinking today. Going to the gym ! .Tomorrow makes two weeks ! Wow no black ours no regrets nothing to worry about these two weeks. !!! .And my emotions are coming back I forgot how complex I am !! Craved a beer last night. Chugged a Seltzer instead and Drew what I looked like when I was 17 when before booze drugs porn and parties. !..Forgot how cool and counter culture I was. ! Not letting my inner child down ! ..I'm the shit and so are all of you. Keep it up!..Alcohol is the opiate of the masses!
**Struggle:** I just started a new semester in a program I already hate and the tiny bit of hope I had for maybe a better course has completely disappeared now that I've seen it. Dreading the rest of the year and struggling with my motivation to even do my work...**Triumph:** I am focusing on transferring my motivation into my sobriety and am feeling very positive about that part of my future at least. I've been reading some blogs and overall am just happy to be here on day 2 so I'll count that as a small triumph...**General:** My life is quite dull and I feel very unhappy and unfullfilled and I think drinking helped fill some of the holes that I now have to face. It's a lot but I'm aware I need to deal with it and am confident I can manage. I know alcohol won't magically make my life a million times better but it will AT LEAST stop holding me back from moving forward mentally/emotionally like I need to. ..Thanks so much. I'm happy to be here in this community with everyone and I will not drink with you all today :)
Sorry about your Mom that must be hard. I have to say though I love your new motto!!!
I. Am. So. Close. 
Struggle: These freaking panic attacks and bouts of anxiety. I had been hoping sobriety would completely deliver them back to hell where they came from but surprise surprise I still have to maintain a mental health regimen. Back to the doctor's to adjust my meds I go...Triumph: I used the extra money that I have laying around from all the wine I haven't bought to upgrade my gym membership and now I get to use the massage loungers. Sweet baby Jesus those things are terrific...General: My 12-week-old St. Bernard puppy is at 30 pounds officially bigger than my adult dog. She still bosses him around and probably always will which is going to be great when he's full-grown and maybe 5 times her size.
