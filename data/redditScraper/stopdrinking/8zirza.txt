Hey SD. I relapsed again. This time was probably the worst it's ever been. But I'm here and I need . support more than ever right now.....I just can't stop screwing up. Alcohol is my dark passenger and it's time to say goodbye. For today for tomorrow forever....I know relapse is apart of the recovery process but honestly I hope that I won't ever have to undergo it again. I put my loved ones through absolute hell yesterday and I can't even look at myself in the mirror...I'm not afraid of sobriety. In fact I want it more than ever.. but I'm afraid of alcohol. I'm afraid of the control it has on me entirely. When I was actively drinking I didn't do it every day but when I do drink I can't stop. I become a vile angry and disturbing excuse for a human. ..It's a battle I've been fighting for almost 10 years. And I'm done failing. If I don't change I will lose everything. It's life or death at this point and I want to live. I NEED sobriety so bad. ..IWNDWYT....

One day at a time that's how we do it from here on out. You can do this and we are in your corner!  I know it's hard but go easy on yourself. The first few days will be the hardest but just remember why your doing it to rid yourself of the toxic hold alcohol has over us...IWNDWYT 
My last relapse was the worst ever too ! This sobriety is the best ever ! We are gonna make . IWNDWYT  
Just one day at a time we are here for you. I will not drink with you today
