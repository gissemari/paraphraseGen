If you feel isolated because of a drinking problem please don't. Not only is everyone here at /r/stopdrinking a resource as well as AA SMART recovery and other groups.....At least 1 in 10 Americans is struggling with alcohol as well. Or at least 1 in 10 Americans consumes over 10 units a day of alcohol. (I personally have generally drank less than that but I know for sure that I have a drinking problem at levels far below 74 drinks a week.)..So if you're struggling with alcohol that doesn't make you a loser or an asshole or anything other than one of the many people who have difficulty with this substance...And guess what? THREE in ten Americans don't drink at all. Another three in ten have less than one drink per week. Being sober (or hardly drinking at all) is the NORM even though you'd never think it from television shows commercials or looking at the people filing into the pub on a Sunday afternoon...Source: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/09/25/think-you-drink-a-lot-this-chart-will-tell-you/?utm_term=.f31d6f5729f7..*Numbers are only for USA but I have to assume similar trends are true in many other countries.

Finally being last pays off! Thanks!
HOLY SHIT. I'm FLOORED by this data. Could this be true? Are that many people self-medicating unhappy addicted and/or stuck? There's something very wrong with this. I wish people could find the joy in simply living. I can't help but wonder if something within our culture leads us to want to escape this much. ..I'm totally rambling. But this shocked me. This information makes me want to hug every single person I see today. It makes me feel sad for my fellow humans. We need to find the joy in the little stuff. ..Sorry if this comment comes off offensive. I mean no harm. But this information bums me out a great deal.
