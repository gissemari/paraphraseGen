Howdy sober friends.  I am looking for advice from anyone who has been able to endure frequent travel for work and stay sober. ..Long story short this isn't my first stint of sobriety. I was sober for 20 months before my most recent relapse. When I relapsed I was traveling about 80% of the time for work. As a closet drinker most of my drinking at the end was done in hotels so obviously being alone in a hotel hundreds if not thousands of miles from home was a huge trigger for me. Not to mention the multitude of bars at airports.  I believe this combined with my failure to maintain my spiritual fitness led to my most recent relapse. ..I mention this because I was recently presented with a fantastic job opportunity that pays about 1.5 times my current salary and has fantastic benefits. It is also exactly the direction that I want my career to take. The problem is that it will require about 20% travel. Obviously I'm concerned that this will trigger a relapse but The opportunity is just too good to turn down. ..I'm hoping that some of my sober peeps on here can share any experiences they have on traveling alone and still staying sober. ..Thanks everyone!  This forum has really strengthened my sobriety. I read it every morning on my patio with a cup o' joe. ..Sorry for the long winded post..IWNDWYT!
