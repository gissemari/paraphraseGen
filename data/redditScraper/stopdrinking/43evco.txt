I'm heartbroken it's came to this I relapsed on Labor Day been fighting ever since got a DUI last summer and another in December I spent the holidays in jail including my birthday. I'm headed back to treatment outpatient this time and living in a transitional living. ..I have been sober 46 days today however this time has been really painful I'm adopted I wasn't brought up this way so my parents don't understand how tough this is for me. I'm 36 I'm broke and unemployed and never been married. I haven't really lived yet but I'm not going to drink today I am going to do the things I was sloppy at doing the first time around AA and a sponsor I'm also going to work with a psychiatrist. Please wish me well

you're strong motivation speak directly to my soul. You can do this. Do it for yourself and to honor you're life it's worth..God be with you.
Sounds like you have a solid plan. Honesty open mindedness and willingness will take you to great places in sobriety. Please keep us posted. You're not alone. 
Your in my heart and prayers. You will survive this and be stronger. 
I am wishing you all the best in making the best choices I have been there too 2 DUI's before the age of 21 jail I pushed my mom while I was drunk she fell and broke her arm  she was 89 ..much more)  that's the first time I said that out loud  it took me awhile but I'm here and staying !! so keep coming back .You can do this 
Welcome! You have found a place where there is always someone to talk to who understands what you are going through. Solid recovery plan! We can do this... one day at a time. Congrats on 46 days!
Good luck!!!
I wish you the very best!
You've got this.
I wish you well that you find your way out of this pain. 
Wishing you the very best. Keep trying.
A friend of mine was adopted and like you was not raised in an alcohol prone home.  And yet when she had a drinkit turned into PARTEEE TIME YIPPEE I'll have another -- an over the top moment which was totally out of character as I knew her at work.  I think her biological parents may have had alcohol issues which she inherited.  For example American Indians have alcohol issues.  Just an observation that might be helpful or not.
Good luck. Keep on fighting. You can do this.

do the stuff you don't want to do and it will work out.  Don't give up.
Your life is taking a different path to the "traditional" way however you can choose how you want it to go from this point forward.  You can't control if you get married or get a job but you can control what sort of single life you lead what sort of woRk you create for yourself and you can control if you drink or. Not.  Not sure if the adoption issue is part of them reason you drink or not...... Maybe you need to address that in counselling.  But the best counselling experience I ever had was when we stopped looking at the past and focussed on the now. So.... You are adopted you can't change that or wish it a way but you can deal with how you feel  about it and you can address that part by changing the way you think about it..... The drinking you can deal with it's in you to do so but sometimes we get stuck on our thinking and we alw our thoughts to go unchallenged.  Time to turn ebverything your thought you knew upside down shake it up and be humble enough to recognise that you (we all) "know" very little we just make a whole lot of assumptions and let them guide our life our thinking our decisions.  Can is suggest you consider exploring these comments with a therapist or start reading up on these themes.  There are some great self help books you cab read and explore the concepts  with  your sponsor.  Good luck your journey begins today (or 45 days ago lol) I don't need to wish you luck I wish that you recognise your inner strength and harness it for your benefit stay strong and know there are thousands of us out there choosing not to drink today because we can't and because we don't want to been there done that and know that drinking is not for us...
Sorry for the heartaches.  I truly do wish you well and look forward to watching your success story from this point on.
Hang in there. It's a daily struggle for all of us you're in good company!
Sending you my best wishes and good luck with your outpatient treatment.
I am wishing you well! I am also 36 and I'm so grateful that I'm doing this now while I still feel like I have a lot of life left ahead of me. Great work on your 46 days !! :)
So you are going back to treatment...At the risk of quoting you out of context.....&gt;I'm heartbroken it's came to this.....your return to treatment is not "heartbreaking."..***It's totally fucking AWESOME!!!***..It rocks!  You rock!!  Everything rocks!!!..You my fine Reddit friend have been the beneficiary of one of the Greatest Gifts anyone can receive in their Recovery Journey even if you do not yet realize it...You have been Blessed with The Gift of Desperation...Do you have a lot of issues on your plate?  Sure do.  Were they your fault?  Sure were.  Can you overcome them and have a rich and wonderful life?..**SURE CAN!!**..And this is the way of it.  The time for bullshit is over.  Listen to your Counselors.  Take the suggestions they give you.  Admit when you are wrong...Remain open-minded to a new way of life and in the deepest part of your heart know this:..Responsibility does *not* tie us down...It sets us free...Take it one day at a time  KreamoftheKropp and *ROCK ON!!*.
This is only the beginning. I didn't get this sober thingy the first time around and I am glad I didn't. I made it out safe with a much valued perspective. I feel much more involved and responsible for my sobriety this time. I wish you well "this time" too! Congrats on 46 days!
You can do this. I went to treatment 2 years ago this spring and it made all the difference. Not just in not drinking but it the way I faced my life. ..You can do this. 36 is young! You have a lot to look forward to just put this behind you once and for all. 
Take care of yourself.  You deserve it.  
You sound heartbroken.  So I give you a piece of mine to help with the healing.  Be gentle -- but ruthless -- with yourself.  Blessings.
Man I wish the VERY best for you. 
Hey there Congratulations on 46 days!!  You are in front of me - I'm on 28 days.  This time around I am happier not drinking and hope it's the same for you.
Hey fellow DUI partner  you can do it! 
Keep going! 
Best of luck to you.  
Dude just read your story.  I am sitting in detention I'm spending another weekend here part of 30 days of detention after receiving my 3rd DUI.  I know that your feeling down but if you really open your eyes and heart to the possibilies treatment has to offer your legal troubles will be a part of your past and you'll be freed from the bondage that alcohol has you in.  Good luck and my sponsor has related this little bit of advice to me:  "when do you know that you've hit rock bottom?  You put down the shovel.".
46 days is a great accomplishment. Praying and thinking good thoughts for you. 
I wish I was 36 and getting my shit together like you. Lucky bastard!
Thank you everyone I was moved to tears reading your responses I'm honestly scared and feeling really down today I'm trying to find a meeting close because I don't have a car here or license for that matter.
