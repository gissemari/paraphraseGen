What's up everyone?  How are your days going so far?  Any noteworthy successes challenges goals??  How about any skills used to beat back those cravings?  Anything you all are grateful for at this current moment?  So far my anxiety and depression has been at a minimum so I'm thankful for that.  My medication is tending to make me oversleep and feel drowsy often though which is kind of annoying (prozac).  I'm trying to find ways to combat that.  Lots of coffee seems to help a little.  I graduated from the intensive outpatient program I was in last week so that is a nice accomplishment under my belt.  Still feel like I got a lot of work ahead of me in terms of recovery though.  Got to do a writing assignment for my therapist on any angers or resentments I have in me towards myself and others.  It's supposed to go along with my 12-step work so I can see the benefits on writing this sort of thing out I'm just worried it might bring back some negative emotions that I prefer to keep at bay.  I guess I'm just going to have to suck it up and go through with it though.  Overall things seem to be turning up so that is good though there are still some stressful and emotional days for me especially during this month.  Just thought I'd share briefly some of my thoughts to help myself feel better and realize I am not alone in the struggle.  Hope to hear back from you all!

Writing things out can be incredibly cathartic! When did you start Prozac? I'm on a bus home after a pint of OJ with my folks.
