I was completely hammered at one point struggling to walk falling down...At some point I found myself driving a car with no control of it just blasted out of my mind crashing into things. I would swear I was going to wake up in jail this morning...Thank god it was a dream and I woke up in my bed but seriously what the hell?

I read a post in here recently about drinking dreams that included an except from a psychologist who wrote to the OP on the subject. The psychologist basically said that dreams are at least in part a way for the mind to process different scenarios that would arise from decisions not taken in waking life. A dream like yours could be interpreted as the subconscious reinforcing your conscious decision to give up drinking by presenting you with a vivid negative example of what could happen if you changed your mind.
