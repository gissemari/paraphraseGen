You have given yourself a respite for days months or years by not drinking for the time being.  Even if you completely fail in the future you are giving yourself invaluable time by not drinking.

Perceptive thought.
Exactly. It is that thought that crosses my mind when I am in need for one. ONE drink. I read stories from people who relapse or slip after a year or more start again at day 1 with pride and determination that they made it out of the hole again. ..It is like filling the hole you are in with one hand of sand a day. In the beginning it feels nearly impossible to get out of a deep hole. But when you are a year in there is so much sand in that hole that it is not so deep anymore and you can find your way to the surface much faster.
