My boyfriend (23m) of 6 years is going to rehab Friday. He's very close with my family but they have absolutely no idea he's an alcoholic. I was in denial for so long but just this past week he's owned up to all his lies and admitted that he has a problem and needs help. I've always put him on a pedestal and I don't want anyone to look down on him. I know being an alcoholic is a disease and isn't something to be ashamed of but I'm struggling with this. Any advice is appreciated.

r/alanon would probably be a better resource for this type of question.  I hope it all works out!
You might want to reach out to r/AlAnon. It's a group for people who love an alcoholic and they will be better able to give you support. Or you might try r/scienceandkindness. It's another great sub for loved ones dealing with someone else's addiction issues...
