I'm feeling completely helpless. I've known I've had a problem with alcohol for a few years now. Definitely a functioning alcoholic.  I'm a married guy with an incredible wife an amazing stepdaughter and a baby on the way but for years before that I lived on my own doing whatever I wanted. Off at 4 o'clock during the week why not pick up a 6 of tall boys on my way home every single day?  ..Two years ago I moved in with my now wife. I definitely slowed down but she's a nurse who works 12 hour shifts. If she was working weekends I'd start drinking as soon as she left in the mornings. There's been 3 or 4 instances where she's come home and I've been caught completely trashed having 12+ strong beers. Needless to say she wasn't happy. I've cut back but I keep screwing up. ..Lately I've thought that it's time to quit. Went to a concert with a drinking buddy last week and promised her I'd be the DD. We went up early and I drank in the afternoon before the show. Still came home smelling like beer and cigarettes and she wasn't happy and neither was I. She wouldn't speak to me and she had every right to be angry...I managed to stay sober all this past week then the weekend hit. I haven't been getting drunk drunk but man I've still had beers. This past week was incredible. I woke up feeling great every day. My stepdaughter and I have been getting along so much better. ..I haven't told my wife I'm trying to quit for good. I'm just so embarrassed that I can't seem to keep it together for more than a week. I've seen how much better my life can be without alcohol. I used to love playing guitar and for years now I've spent more time drinking than I have playing. I've already messed it up for today with 3 tall boys by 1pm but tomorrow is a fresh start. I'm facing next weekend with the house to myself again. I know I can do it but it's going to be a struggle. I feel like now is the time to finally start posting here. I need some accountability and you're all so inspiring. Please wish me luck.

&gt;I've already messed it up for today with 3 tall boys..I'm sorry you're struggling. As outlined in the community guidelines we ask that you only post when you have not been drinking. For this reason we had to remove your post. But we'll be here tomorrow if you want to come back then.
