As I come up on 2 years without booze I just wanted to stop in and say thank you to everyone here...This sub has been a big part of my ability to stay sober. It's so nice to have a supportive place to share the struggles and small victories. ..Every day I have at least one moment where I rember my sad spiraling relationship with alcohol and I can't imagine where I'd be if hadn't made some adjustments to my thinking choices and routines. ..If you're here thinking about quitting I'd tell you you're in the right place. Get started. ..Otherwise happy to not drink with you all and just generally happy to be alive  ..Thanks!
