here's something that's clear to me now. I drank for 2 decades of my life. that is more of my life with alcohol in it then not. it's took a long time for my brain to really learn what it feels like to live sober. even with close to 2 years just prior to this stretch there was a small part in there that thought alcohol was the solution to whatever bad feelings i was having. I'm grateful to still be in that sober mindset now so even though i have only week because my relapse only lasted a few days in reality I drank for a few days out of almost 2 years. but for those just starting off and struggling if you were a long-time drinker like myself you really have to give it some time before you can truly get your brain off of thinking it's missing alcohol because that's what it has come to expect. You also have to be kind to yourself and not think you're failing because you still want alcohol.

Funny that you mention the being kind to yourself thing.  ..I was incredibly upset with myself yesterday when I was really craving the booze around the witching hour...I'd been having a few craving-free days and I was thinking I was in the clear.  Nope...I felt like a failure because I wanted to drink...I guess I would have felt worse if I'd caved...And you're right after decades of drinking it would have been quite the miracle if at 18 days I was "cured."..Thanks for the post and iwndwyt.
