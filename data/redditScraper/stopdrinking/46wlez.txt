Long story short I was planning drinking this weekend but things kept coming up that got in the way of my plan to check out of my life for a while. I am very happy not to be hung over today. But I need to do something different or it's just a matter of time. ..I have also been reading a lot of "I drank this weekend just once and am going back to being sober" posts today.  Not judging believe me. I know everyone's issue is different and can handle different things. But it got me thinking what ARE the risks of just drinking once? OK obviously relapse is a risk but health wise. Does one night of heavy drinking make you "start over" with the health benefits of not drinking for a month or more? ..I guess I'm looking for more motivation not to reset.

.Well okay avoiding the obvious *horrific* risk of starting a big slide the ones I *have* heard about are related to at sober-droughts such as your at 40 days or more is that your tolerance begins to go down so if you're "used to X" amounts and subconsciously try to kick back "your old style" then you can overshoot and get into trouble because it's "effectively" more than it was in the "old days". ..But like you have been following the board this was a close call. I  saw another post of a "close call" and I think there's things to think about now that you're slightly more out of the danger zone in that first sentence "long story short". ..I like to diagram / chart complex things out on paper because a system I worked out a while back was sometimes you can use charts or diagrams to "safely contain" multi issues "in their own sections of the paper" and then deal (or not!) with them one at a time and it helps me at least not to keep frog-hopping all around in a giant wavy circle until it all collapses. ..Feel free to join us in the chat to thrash it out! .https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/stopdrinking/..
I know me.  If I give up what I have earned then It MIGHT be easier to do again next time then the next time........I feel it probably would start that long slow journey back into the abyss.  I will make my decisions based on if drinking is worth all the risks and negatives involved with it.  Right now my calculations say "Hell No!"  Not even close.  Screw alcohol.  
Just read a comment from someone that really rang true for me. The person described a phenomenon that occurs in alcoholics after a period of abstinence. The brain will intensely crave alcohol and the person acelerates their drinking to make up for the dry spell. It was certainly true with me. One drink and all is lost in my case. Once I figure I have blown my streak of days my whole attitude changes and thus begins the cycle of shame guilt and self destruction.  
https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/4686xx/some_science_on_drinking_abstinence_and_relapse/...For me (and I do plan on drinking again) I'm most concerned about damage to my brain my ability to concentrate problem solve reaction time etc.  I gave up drinking for lent which is 46 days but after lurking here and reading the science I don't think 46 days is enough time to recover much. I'm still trying to get to the day 14 milestone where irritability And mild confusion are gone :)..Anyway- if a person drinks just once then never again then physically the impact is probably low. But is that realistic ? I have to ask myself that now. I don't really know what I'll do at the end of 46 days but I can't go back to drinking a bottle of wine a night. 
One of biggest risks of relapse is [kindling](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindling_\(sedative-hypnotic_withdrawal\)).     .In other words withdrawals become worst with each relapse. 
I have some experience with this. Once I drank again things got bad incredibly quickly. I no longer cared about sobriety I got really depressed and I couldn't pull myself out of it I felt like I couldn't contact people from the program and I felt completely alone. I know that one drink won't physically kill me but I know it could take me somewhere truly dangerous and I wouldn't be able to stop it. I had to learn this for myself the hard way. It sucked.
