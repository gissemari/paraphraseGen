So I had gotten used to having vivid realistic dreams where I would drink (knowing full well the consequences as my dream-self). Then I'd wake up in a panic and feel relieved but anxious as if it had really happened. Now I see those dreams as constructive reminders of all the fear and suffering I'll have to deal with if I drink again so they're actually really helpful...Recently though I had a dream where I "came to" so to speak in the dream and was already sipping a drink. It was sweet. I started to drink it more deeply. I realized it was a beer but it was like a Trippel or something and tasted like honey and Coke. I drank it fearlessly until it was about half gone...Then I had the thought "Huh. I don't really think this is a big deal. I don't really want the rest of this drink."..And that was it. I woke up...I don't know that anyone will get anything out of this post but I wanted to put it up here as a form of accountability or reminding myself that a red flag was raised because I don't think this is a constructive dream. I think it could be a sign of my thoughts shifting toward relapse subconciously. Like the lizard's telling me "Go for it dude you've only had a few slips this past year and a half you're not addicted anymore!"..I'm not going to obsess over this dream because it was just a dream but the stark contrast to my "normal" drinking dreams sort of shook me but only days later when I thought about the contrast...Anyway I know this isn't the most exciting post ever just needed to get it our there. Thanks for reading. Here's to not drinking today!..::tips hat in your direction::
