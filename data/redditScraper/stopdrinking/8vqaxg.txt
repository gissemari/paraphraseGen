Why am I finding it relatively easy to stay sober so far?  I have a few thoughts.  Now while it has been much easier than ever before that doesnt mean I am being complacent its only a week and pride cometh before a fall.  I am VERY guarded about my thinking right now. ..This is why I think its different this time:..1.  Acceptance - I have truly accepted that I am addicted to ethanol.  That ethanol is an addictive substance and that anyone in time can become addicted...2.  Understanding Ethanol - I have for the first time in my life researched ethanol and I now understand what it is.  It's a poison.  It is contained in petrol (gasoline).  It is absorbed into every cell of the body.  It damages every organ in the body.  It raises your chances of cancer of almost every organ and of your throat (breasts if you are a woman).  Alcoholic drinks are nothing more than a delivery device for a poison called ethanol.  Similar to cigarettes being a delivery device for nicotine (and hundreds of other carinogens).  This is a wake up call for me and should be for you...3.  Understanding Ethanol addiction - I now know why I felt shit and obsessed about drink.  I now know why I failed time after time.  I now know why I drank to blackout stage several nights a week.  I now know why ethanol had so much power over and get this; because I know this I am able to turn it around and now I am the one who has the power!!!!!  By not drinking I am the one in control and that makes me feel absolutely amazing...Summary:  While I have thoughts of ethanol I havent been obsessing.  I havent been miserable like before.  I feel a sense of freedom and of hope and while not yet fully realised it is right there for the taking...For all those struggling in the early days try to find true acceptance of your problem then embark on a journey of understanding ethanol and addiction to ethanol.  Do not stop researching until you fully grasp what it is all about.  When you do this I can almost guarantee it is like a Eureka moment a moment of great lucidity and calm.  It is a moment when you finally realise that you are NOT weak you have just been TRICKED...Now you know you can take those first steps into the light and taste the freedom that is falling on to many people in this sub on a daily basis...I have had such a lovely sober non-alcohol obsessed week.  Thank you SD for being there.  Let's continue to inform and support and set our brothers and sisters free.  Thank you also for supporting me...Ethanol:  Don't need it don't want it and it has no power over me.  Not any more.  I feel like Superman :)
