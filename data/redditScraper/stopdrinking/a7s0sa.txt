To start our age gap is big and I am worried about him - his health and happiness. I want to help him and I try to ask but I never get a straight answer. I'm struggling because my father was an alcoholic and I went through a lot with him and I'm beginning to feel guilty because I feel hopeless sometimes. I feel like he doesn't want help because he doesn't want to do any support groups or see a doctor or anything of that sort. He just says he'll get better on his own; he has relapsed today pretty badly and said some very depressing and angry things. I don't want to give up on him.. I love him so much and I want to support/help but I don't know what the right things to say/do are. ..I appreciate this group so much because it gives me hope even if I'm not struggling with drinking myself it just reminds me everyone has potential and is strong - That it is not impossible to get better.

Only he can decide to get help. ..You might try an Alanon group. That is for families/friends of alcoholics. .And yeah if he won't see a doctor or consider support chances are he is not ready to stop. 
You might want to reach out to r/AlAnon. It's a group for people who love an alcoholic and they will be better able to give you support. Or you might try r/scienceandkindness. It's another great sub for loved ones dealing with someone else's addiction issues.
You're a good person for trying to help. My biggest challenge initially was (1)asking for help and (2)then being able to accept it. I couldn't be helped until I took the support I was offered. I second sfgirlmary's advice and hope he comes around to accepting help for himself. Do be kind to yourself during this time. This disease takes a toll. Wish you the best!
