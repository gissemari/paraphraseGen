Welcome back my friend 65 days is great.
Nice work on your 65 days!  Glad to hear you're back.  Relapses can be scary :/   Hope you're feeling better
Welcome back - 65 days was a great effort.  My best has been 60 days.  And here I am back again.
You're back. That's the main thing. Stay strong friend.
You are here again and fighting for it keep on keeping on!
3 times I have made it 50+ but never 60. This time I will. Great job getting back here after 2 weeks. Much tougher to do than it sounds!
60 seems impossible to me. Today is my Day 30 and I'm struggling to make it to 31. Thanks for sharing and I'm not drinking with you today. 
What was the trigger for the relapse and what would you avoid next time?
Welcome back. 
Welcome back. Glad you're here.
Welcome back glad you came back so soon. I will join you in not drinking 
Hey it happens! Its a tough fight! Just remember what's important is that you came back and you're actively working to stop! Hang in there! You'll feel better in a few days!
