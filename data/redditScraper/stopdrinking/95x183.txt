I think I'm more understanding of 'progress not perfection'...I woke up today and realized what had happened last night. I drank wine after 5 weeks sober. Instead of beating myself up I said "Well ok. Day 1". I'm not weak or a bad person for drinking last night. It happened and I will start over. That's ok. I do not feel as horrible as the first time. This acceptance I have in myself for the choices I make the the decisions I will/need to make for the betterment of myself is new. I got that from sobriety.  There was a need for me to drink last night and I did it. There are things here in this world that don't mix with me. Caserole's sobriety means altering the relationship I have with intoxicants and not pretending they don't exist in this world with me. I can't deny their presence but I can change how I use them...My good friend told me yesterday before I chose to drank that sobriety is not just "quitting drinking". It's a cleansing of your mentality an assessment of tools we chose to utilize that prevent us from processing our emotions. ..My personality has changed dramatically since I started my journey. The relapses are \*part\* of it not the end of it. ..Wishing you all the best xxx..TIWNDWY

I relapsed 2 days ago I'm hung over and depressed.
You learned some things.  That's great.  Getting sober requires changing your life which is hard as hell and will certainly involve some bumps in the road.  I'm sorry this one included booze for you but IME a short relapse can be a great place to grow from.  
Relapses happen but they don't have to be part of recovery. It might be a good exercise to look at what was going on in your life before that first drink was picked up to learn and avoid in the future.
