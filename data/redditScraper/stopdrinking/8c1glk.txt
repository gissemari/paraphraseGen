My family plans through no fault of their own fell through tonight.I was banking on these plans to help keep me sober this evening.I have plans with a sober friend tomorrow .I know I shouldn't rely on external sources for my sobriety and that the answer is just go to a meeting tonight.Idk why likely because I'm only at a week but going to a meeting alone gives me such anxiety.All I can do is sit and watch Netflix and think about how my boyfriend broke up with me during my 2 month long on and off relapse and wether I should message him or not (bad idea).I know what I should be doing focussing on me and my own sobriety and not dwelling on the past plus going to meetings even if alone but I just want to sit here and cry .Fackkkkkkkkk sobriety is roughghghg.Feels like I'm going to be alone forever.I don't want to kill myself but I don't want to be alive right now

Hey hang in there! You are not alone in those feelings. A big important part of my sobriety is letting myself feel those feelings...You don't have to go to a meeting (I do go to meetings and if I went to a meeting every time I felt like I needed to I wouldn't have time for anything else LOL but I go a couple times a week.)..My advice would be feel the feeling but know it is only temporary and discomfort WILL pass...Go for a walk read a book adult coloring book YouTube a podcast cook make tea go for a drive. Anything to redirect your negative thinking when you are in the moment...Yesterday I was about to LOSE it stopped my car (was driving by the beach) just got out and ran. It was probably only a half mile but I haven't done it in YEARS. Felt so good and my anger was halved by the end...A motto I like to use is  move a muscle change a thought. ..Good luck today you got this! It's frustratig when plans fall through but take this and turn it into a positive opportunity to do some self care! Do you like to take baths? Get a nice bath bomb get a manicure but a new face mask at target (or hey if you have the cash go buy some from Lush!) ..You are important and deserve to feel good IWNDWYT and hope your day gets better!
