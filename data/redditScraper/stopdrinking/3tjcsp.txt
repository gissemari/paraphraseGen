After having enough of my internal struggle to control my alcohol intake and failing I have decided to give up alcohol completely. I read Allen Carr's book and it feels like a lightbulb went off in my head. I'm barely in but I'm elated. I still think it's too good to be true so I'm preparing by finding some support :)

Good for you. I am too trying again after failing many times. Feel so much better sober
Hi ..that was my case too. No tampering just cold turkey. The early weeks were a real struggle for me. The most important thing for me has been not thinking about giving up alcohol forever but just today. You will also find good support here. For me SD has been a foundation rock to my recovery...Best of luck!
How is Allen Carr's book? I've seen it mentioned a lot in this sub I'm thinking about giving it a read.
I'm with you. I've tried many times to quit but this time really really feels different.  I've committed myself to a year without alcohol even if I feel zero benefits from it (which is surely ridiculous if I'll get zero benefits from quitting?!).  I'm already feeling more energetic...so I guess I might be in this for the long haul.  And yet one day at a time. Good luck.
Congrats on stopping. Finding support is the first thing to do! well besides stopping the alcohol intake obviously. Just stay honest and true to yourself. Stay in today and remember you are not alone in this! One day at a time sometimes one hour/minute at a time! It's such an amazing journey!
Another set of ideas that are incredibly useful to me [are summarized at this post called the Baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Good for you and good luck to you!
