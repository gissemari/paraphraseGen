My badge means the world to me. When I was struggling I imagined that little star that meant I'd been sober for a month. It's more than a little graphic -- it's 32 days I've been healing getting to know myself in the clear light of day and getting the support I need from my friends therapist and you guys. Thanks to everyone and I'm proud of all of you.

Yes I can relate!  Tomorrow will be 4 weeks for me and like you I am motivated to keep on.   I love waking up in a good mood.  Congrats on your star!
32 for me too :)  Still going strong with therapy and Smart recovery and some good books. I'm proud of us too!  Thanks for sharing. 
Well done on 32 days our little star makes us shine.
I feel the same way. After 40 plus years of drinking I am so looking forward to my star and I'm going to get it. I will not drink so I can get my star. Could not have done it with out you guys.
