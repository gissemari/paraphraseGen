Holy crap apologies for the gigantic wall of text. tl/dr? Scroll to the bottom for lessons learned...77 days ago I discovered the wonder of 'subreddits' after several months of browsing the reddit front page. Two days later i found /r/stopdrinking and 'wasted' pretty much a full day at work reading. For the last year my level of drinking had been increasing - and alarmingly fast since November. ..I made my first post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/pibsb/really_feel_like_a_drink_right_now/) after not drinking for 3 days and got an overwhelming shocking response from people who really genuinely seemed to care about some stranger with the word 'fake' in his username.  When I made this post I had a problem that I've seen many people mention over and over since - I didn't believe I was an alcoholic. Exact words - "I'm not sure I'm full blown alcoholic" and (repeated several times since) "I definitely have a drinking problem". I didn't think I was alcoholic enough to need help even wondered if I was alcoholic enough to be in this sub...Quitting was rough I didn't get the shakes or have any medical problems but it was an emotional roller coaster. Anger depression disasters and temptation at work. Anger so bad I started to seriously wonder if something was wrong with me until the [good people here](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/r4f5s/anger_depression_after_quitting/) reassured me I wasn't going crazy. Through all of this I managed to stay sober but finally 37 days in [I got drunk](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qxc65/do_you_need_to_fail_at_least_once/) for no good reason other than that I wanted to...Badge Reset...The first 37 days was a great learning experience and I found so many things out: I am an Alcoholic. Yes I am 'alcoholic enough' to be here and alcoholic enough to need to quit. No I can't moderate my drinking. I also made a huge discovery (since I've never really tried to quit before) - I woke up hung over and feeling like absolute shit - and I realized that this is how I've felt almost every day for the last 16 years. I haven't been drinking heavily for the last year - **I've been an alcoholic for all of my adult life**.  Revelation time. Looking back on the last 37 days and many of my posts it's obvious I've been spending 37 days trying to convince myself to start drinking again. ..Most importantly time sobriety and a relapse helped me realize that I have been an alcoholic for a long time and although I've never had the 'classic' consequences (DUI Jail Job Loss etc) drinking has still ruined my life.  I realize now that a drunk or hungover person (well me anyway) can't look back and objectivley judge their life for many reasons. They (I) need to look back from the perspective of sobriety...Another 27 days and I'm seriously pondering the question: Do I really *want* to stop drinking? I never learned how to act like a normal person and as far as I could tell alcohol has given me the only shred of a social life I've ever had (more-so in the last year). I know that drinking will destroy my life and kill me but still I am seriously considering abandoning it all and going back to full time drinking - and not just on a "i need a beer" level but on an analytical weighing the benefits and drawbacks level. ..I seriously seriously considered 'quitting quitting drinking' for weeks. Almost posted my goodbye's here. Scumbag alcoholic brain...[14 days ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/s21j5/tomorrow_night_temptation/) I had what I think of as a 'technical relapse'. I was going to a work function and had convinced myself I was obligated to have 1 drink. I had that drink and then a second. I was able to stop at two but I really *really* enjoyed it. I was able to stop at two but I also realized that if I wasn't driving home I would have happily *drank all the beer*. However socially I had a great time and since I had drunk the least I got to be the designated driver for the proverbial drunk hot girls...Badge reset would have gotten wasted if I could have. Lesson learned I don't have to be drunk to have fun (duh)...On to the current set of 13 days and counting. I've hardly thought about drinking in the last 13 days (occasionally though). I think this time is for good though I've made progress on my two major stumbling blocks... 1) I now know how absolutely terrible my life was when I was drinking and 2) I'm starting to understand that I can have a social life without drinking (still working on this one)...So here we are 75 crazy days later a solid 13 on the badge and a strong resolve that I **want** to quit drinking I **can** quit drinking and most importantly I **have** quit drinking.  Maybe I'll end up back at 0 again but I've made the mental shift from an alcoholic who wants to drink to an alcoholic who wants to quit. That part is forever...tl/dr;.**Wisdom? Lessons learned?**..***You are alcoholic enough**. It doesn't matter if you've never had a DUI or gone to jail.  You are alcoholic enough to post here you are alcoholic enough to go to AA and you are alcoholic enough to quit...*If you have to ask if you are an alcholic (or if you've found yourself reading this sub-reddit) you probably are but..*Nobody can give you the label 'alcoholic' but you but you may not admit you are an alcoholic until after you quit..***But don't get hung up on the terminology**. Quit now and figure it all out later because Holy crap you're going to have a lot of time on your hands to think about things...*Your brain will heal and you will think better. If you didn't think your life was bad as an alcoholic you'll probably realize it was far worse than you ever thought...*This is big enough to repeat. [Drinking causes brain damage](http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa53.htm). It takes 6 months to a year for the brain to recover. You're probably going to go through some crazy physical and emotional stuff. Calm down take it slow and enjoy your recovery...*Your damaged brain will do everything it can to get you to drink again. From the obvious cravings and rationalization to subtle subconscious crap you can't even imagine. Your alcoholic brain is your own worst enemy...*You can have a social life without drinking (I think). But you might not believe that until you try it out for yourself (scumbag alcoholic brain)...*Almost everybody relapses. Not everybody but most. It's not the end of the world sober up and try again...*Don't hide not drinking (although I still am stupid). Don't make it a huge issue but don't cover it up. There is a simple logistical reason for this - if people see a known 'drinker' without a drink they'll buy you one (or many). ..*Last but not least? Redditors rock. Thank you to everybody who's ever commented on one of my posts or comments. You've literally helped save my life.

  What a long strange trip it's been  .  I'm happy that you found the courage to keep getting up &amp; trying again. Good on you for having the wisdom to learn from your stumbles.  ..I think you missed something in your post - you forgot to include the part about how *honest* you were in sharing with this subreddit.  That's key. ..Congrats.
Great post and very worthwhile reading...All I can tell you is that every alcoholic either finally decides to stop or ends up homeless or worse...At 50 I stopped just.in.time. and I never want to go back...Thanks for your "75 interesting days".
I didn't have any of the 'classic' consequences either but when I describe my behavior it becomes obvious. I already knew I was an alcoholic when I came to this subreddit but the more I share stories here the more I think- why did I put up with this behavior for so long? It's frightening how much it took to make me want to stop engaging in what amounts to a technically optional activity.
Great great great read!!!!
Those realizations were great! Thank you.

&gt;In the entrepreneurial community there's a saying- fail early fail often...At my last AA meeting there was talk about being "done." Some sponsor had told a guy to go out and get his drink on get it out of his system. Its silly last year I moved to a different state and wanted a new sober start. I spent the past year drinking more than ever. Got way worse because I got a fulltime job salary to support a fulltime habit cost. But that was a good thing. I piled it on so high that it finally pushed me to the point of being done with it...
Here's a crazy thought: Does it really matter whether or not you're an "alcoholic"?  It's just a word.  And if you become a non-drinker you'll never have to let it worry you again.
