Cause that's the thought I had today. Really struggling and ready to pick up and call it quits. Even if it's just for today to have some sort of reprieve as my life still falls to shit even 8.5 months+ sober... meetings haven't been helping. Suffering from the same disease but can't relate to their problems... a lot of  low bottoms- low lose . Idk I guess it's just different and different journeys. But my depression and anxiety is winning and feel like by days end I'll need to reset my day count...

Sorry to hear you're struggling matey!..It'd be a real shame to break that 8+ month streak and almost certainly won't be worth the hangover and regret afterwards.....Try the [IRC Chat](https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/#irc://irc.snoonet.org:+6697/stopdrinking) and talk it through with someone maybe?..I'm not drinking today I hope you'll join me.....Feel better ((hugs))..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
When I first got sober and went to rehab I had a team of medical professionals helping me - a primary care doc psychiatrist nutritionist counselor etc.. The psychiatrist diagnosed me with clinical depression and anxiety and I was prescribed medication...Have you had counseling or any other support?
Look for the similarities not the differences. Some of my favorite AAs are low bottom felons who have learned a better way to live. And that is just the teens I work with. ..IWNDWYT 
Yeah I've had that exact thought when I'm depressed. Never once though when I reached that worse place did I look back on the decisions that led me there and think they were a good idea.
