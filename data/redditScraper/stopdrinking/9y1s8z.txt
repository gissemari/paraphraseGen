Congrats!!
That's a good idea. I hope you had a good experience there. AA is a great place to find support and connection. It's no perfect but if you can roll with it and "take what you like and leave the rest" it works for a lot of people. IWNDWYT
I believe in you! 
I hope it helps you! I hear a lot of positive things about it. We internet strangers on SD are also here  to help. Welcome and all the best to you.
This is a good thing you are goodly. 
Awesome!  Keep coming back!
