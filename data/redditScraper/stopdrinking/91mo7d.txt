I'm 29/M 5'7  was 225 lbs  2 years ago and got down to 180 with diet/exercise/functional alcoholism and struggled to stay there for about a year.  I quit drinking in April and I have been dropping pounds like it's nothin and that's with less  formal  exercise (plenty active but just no gym) and eating whatever the hell I want.  I haven't been eating that poorly meal-wise but I've been HOUSING ice cream.  I'm down to 160-165 and have my waistline from ten years ago.  I am just curious if anyone has heard of a bounce-back effect or anything.  I'm not off the rails with eating and I'm very active but I'm just having trouble believing drinking was holding me at the chubby plateau I had gotten so used to.

It's amazing how many calories alcohol has in it.  You won't bounce back as long as your calories stay about the same..Losing weight is WAY more about calories than working out. Working out is important and great but it's not what drives weight loss/gain. One of my favorite quotes around this is "You can't outrun a fork!". In our case we really can't outrun the bottle.  :)

I'm not sure what to attribute your weight loss to. I'm very happy for you that you can eat what you want with no weight gain. I would start to form good eating habits now while you are skinnier. Sooner or later all that junk food you are eating will show up in your gut. I started putting the weight on at 35 after a life of being skinny. Weight gain or loss is a simple equation of calories in vs calories out so I can't explain what you went through. Congrats on triple digits!
