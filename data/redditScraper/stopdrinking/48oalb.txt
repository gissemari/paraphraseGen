My mom is in fear of me relapsing and is causing her to call and text me constantly.  I overslept today and woke up to many calls and texts.  She called my husband which totally bugs me.  I finally said to her today the alcohol is gone Mom but I am still going to fuck up.  I will still sleep in when I can I will be irritable and unfriendly at times back off (in a polite way).  She realizes she has to let it go.  So that makes me feel better.  I also told her if I relapse it won't be a secret because if I do it will be the death of me and I certainly can't hide my own death.  So I am not worrying about anyone that's worrying about me!

Ugh that sounds frustrating.  Is she aware of the existence of Al-Anon?  It sounds like you are doing a great job setting boundaries by not allowing yourself to get stressed out about her stuff.
My mom did the same thing when I was still drinking and I think it broke her heart. Like /u/HopeIsAStrategy said I'd also recommend Al-Anon. If you want your loved ones to play an active role in your recovery Al-Anon is probably the most effective and healthy tool a loved one can have. You sound like you're doing the right thing so keep on keeping on as the kids say.
Speaking from my own past I lied so much when I was drinking any trust in me went out the window. Its the price (one of) I pay for letting booze come first. I feel like Scrooge sanding his name off the stone.  It has lightened up feel good about this spring.  Best of luck..
