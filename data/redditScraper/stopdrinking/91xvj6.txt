I'm on day 5 of not drinking. ..I'm in my early 30's and can honestly say that I've only been sober 5 consecutive days twice since I was 18 both times were because my son was either being born or ill. Pretty ridiculous and shameful in retrospect and normally that alone would drive me to drink just thinking about it. ..A year and a half ago I had a full physical blood tests x-rays the whole nine yards. The doctor said that I was in incredible health despite my eating habits and my pack a day lungs. This was great news but it was a bit too encouraging for somebody who drinks as heavily as I do. So it got worse (a lot worse) and in the middle of a binge last week I decided it was time to start being a father and not just the drunk on the couch; so here I am. ..Today I had a rough day at work and stopped at the store for smokes but refused to go in because the guy there knows me and would get my 'usual' on the counter before I could get to the register. I went to the gas station instead and I'm calling it a win...I've been lingering here for a while and want to thank you all for being open with your struggles so I knew I wasn't alone. End rant.

Can't wait to be at 5 days. Good job. I'm a new dad in my early 30s as well. I gotta be a sad for my little girl instead of a drunk she ends up hating.
