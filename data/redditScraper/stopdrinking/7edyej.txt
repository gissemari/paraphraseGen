I thought today that maybe the one thing I miss about drinking is having a ready-made excuse for not doing things. I blamed a lot on my drinking but not so much that you know I might have to stop or anything. Let's not do anything drastic I thought...Now I'm trying to address some things without drinking and I don't have the excuse that I couldn't get to it because I "wasn't feeling well" (was hungover). It's a little stressful especially this time of year...Many problems went away when I stopped. Enough of them disappeared that it really is as I've read people say here like playing the game on easy mode. Doesn't mean you never struggle in a boss fight--it just means you're better equipped for it I think...So I've lost an excuse. And pounds. And spending. And fear. And sloth though I still have a good supply of that...I'll take it and not drink with all y'all today.
