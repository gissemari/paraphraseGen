I know 70 isn't exactly a landmark so to speak but for me it was really symbolic. I was blindsided. The amount of times I wanted to drink from days 60-70 was unbelievable. The stuff life threw at me the random urges the brain slowly trying to retreat to its old habits. I learned something important the past ten days...Respect and fear. I RESPECT the power that alcoholism has over me and I respect that my urges are a symptom of the disease. I FEAR the outcome IF I drink. I do not fear day to day life and I don't fear what some would call an inevitable slip but I do deeply fear that morning after. I am learning fear and respect are deeply intertwined and the work never stops because the days pile up...My message is not to live in fear. Living in fear is essentially anxiety fearing occurrences that have yet to occur. However I believe a compartmentalized fear of a specific outcome such as relapsing builds respect for the disease and for yourself...The work never ends. Don't give up!

Kudos for 70 days! I too have a healthy respect and fear of the power of alcohol. It has helped me stay sober all these years.
I had a similar experience. 60 to 90 the first time was nutso for me. I am glad to report it got a lot more stable as time went by. Keep it up!
I loved your post. 80 isn't exactly a landmark either but it also is to me.  I have been chewing the gum and drinking the club sodas La Croix coffee and popcorn.  Popcorn takes time to eat and passes the urges for me.  I hope as people say it gets better and easier all the time.  I haven't had a real hard time to tell you the truth because this place Really does me good and drinking alcohol is NOT an option.  Happy Saturday night everyone..
