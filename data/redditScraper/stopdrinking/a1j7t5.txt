I relapsed last week (obvi need new badge) and feel absolutely awful about it. This time it was the stress and boredom of being home parenting my kid and I think being low on energy due to mild depression. I feel terrible and guilty but am determined to get back into sobriety. IWNDWYT.

Dont beat yourself up a out it my friend it took me about 25 times before it stuck! Keep up the good work and get back on that damn horse!! 
I'm glad you're back; many don't make it. ..I couldn't stay sober for one day without lots of help. I got a therapist who nudged me onto the road to recovery. I drank well past when I knew I should stop so alcohol literally backed me into a corner. Drinking put at risk custody of my children and a professional degree. I went to detox rehab completed outpatient treatment and got involved in AA. ..The only requirement for AA is a desire to stop drinking. Meetings put me in touch with others who understood what I was going through. Seeing people who were sober and happy gave me hope. ..My children deserved a sober Mom and with help they got one! I hope you find the support you need and deserve.
