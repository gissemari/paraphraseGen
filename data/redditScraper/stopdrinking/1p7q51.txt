Hello! I have been reading posts in this sub for a few days now and have been very inspired by some of the posts here. You are a lovely community and I created this throwaway to post here...I have seen some folks talk about how to proceed with actually stopping drinking. Often the advice is to "just stop" however I am struggling with that. I have been an alcoholic for about 7 years now and I want to stop. I very recently admitted to myself that I have a serious problem and absolutely lack the self-control to moderate my drinking. I drink until I pass out every single day. I ignore my (amazing) friends and choose to stay at home regularly and I tell myself that even if I did hang out with them I would be so shitfaced that I would be uninteresting to talk to. I am so hungover everyday that I just waddle my way through work always looking forward to the end of my shift so that I can drink off last night's hangover. ..I realize that I am destroying my body and my relationships with my friends family and coworkers and I need to make a change but it has been 2 years since the last time I went more than 24 hours without drinking and I have not been able to will myself to stop. ..I found a nearby support group that meets weekly called SMART but have backed out of going at the last minute the last 2 weeks and I also have good health insurance. What have you done to stop? What does day one look like? How do you sleep? Did you get help from a doctor or therapist and if so how did you find the right person to get help from? ..Thanks in advance. I believe that I am ready to change I just don't know how to take the first step and am frankly terrified of trying to sleep or be alone with my thoughts sober.

If you are drinking heavily every day you need to talk to a doctor about quitting. Alcohol withdrawal can be dangerous. Being honest with a doctor allows an evaluation of your detox needs to be made. Medication prevents seizure lessens symptoms and makes you more comfortable. Thus it is safer and easier to stop. This medication is inexpensive. Have a chat with a physician.

Medical opinion is very sensible and maybe talk to them about rehab options. In the meantime try and get through the mental block and get yourself to a meeting - having the support of other alcoholics in rehab and at meetings gave me the strength to get through the early period. The sleep and sober thoughts thing sucks and it's not easy but it is possible and it does get better pretty quickly. And the good news is that sober sleep rocks... ..Good luck :) 
So you are existing and you want to make the leap to living!  SMART is a smart way of starting your journey.  You have to take the leap.  Anyone here with day two on their badges has done it.  ..You make the decision to stop and you stop.  It ain't easy but it is possible.  The withdrawals can be bad so a visit to your doctor...You will need courage.  I didn't have the courage to kill myself so I switched it to an easier option which was the courage to save my life.  Its working out well at the moment.  ..I wish you well no need to be scared we all started on our own journey.  Good Luck on yours hopefully it starts today!
I've got 200 days in and Day One was the hardest and greatest day of my life. Read the post here by fluffykittenpaws that's pretty much the way to go about it.  ..And get your ass into that SMART meeting. Just do it. DO IT. This isn't going to change unless you do something so **do something**. Guess what? You aren't special. Everything in your post indicates that you are another one of us and you're scared and worried about life **without** alcohol and tired and ashamed about your life **with** alcohol. Well in that SMART meeting is a roomful of people who know EXACTLY how you feel and they all want nothing more than to teach you how they stopped feeling that way. So DO IT. Go in because nothing changes if nothing changes.  ..I've got 200 days in. What did I do to stop? 90 minutes after I woke up on Day One I was in my first meeting. I was a hot mess an absolute wreck so hung over I felt like I had been dragged through the knothole in a fence. But I went. And now today is my 201st "Day One" in a row.  ..Go to the damn meeting already. If not SMART then try AA. Stop thinking and start doing.

This is such a difficult question. The only answer I can see is to just do it. This may sound counter-intuitive but what helped me was the fact that the doctor who was recommended to me was so busy that I had to wait a few weeks for my appointment. This created a target date in my brain. I did not try to stop while waiting but there was an end in sight!  Now over three years later my life has completely turned around. I think that at one point in time you just need to jump.
Like others have said already it would be best to speak with a doctor they can help with any withdrawal symptoms that may occur. After that find a support group.  You don't have to go through this alone but you do have to be willing to take that first step. ..It's a lot easier if you just focus on staying sober one day at a time.  Find something to keep your mind occupied whether it's movies tv a book.  Fizzy drinks and sweets help out a lot.  In the beginning your  body is craving the absent sugar so sweets help to mitigate some of the cravings.  It also helps if you make a list of the reasons why you want to quit.  ..Once you get past the first few days it gets easier.  After the first week or so you should be sleeping a lot better.  And I can't even describe how good it feels waking up without a hangover and being clear headed. 
Hey congratulations on your decision to want to stop! I spent a lot of time *not* wanting to stop and I remember how awful/amazing/terrified I felt when I finally realized that I actually wanted to get sober. I also drank to the point of passing out every night and constantly told myself "tomorrow is day one." ..&gt;I just don't know how to take the first step and am frankly terrified of trying to sleep or be alone with my thoughts sober...Oh wow man my heartstrings. There's a time to reflect on all those things that hurt but it's not now. You're going through a huge change and getting out of the cups is very very difficult. If you stay up entertaining the demons that's a setup for failure but if you start making a habit of finding peace with yourself then with practice it'll start to stick. For me I was nice to myself. I said over and over again "one thing at a time." I ate pizza. Shit I ate non-stop. I zoned out watching Netflix. I refreshed Reddit a billion times. I took long walks and took my sweet time at work and just looked around. Other stuff could wait getting sober was rough enough...I was insanely scared to talk to anybody about my alcoholism but I found a psychiatrist and a therapist (not too hard with good insurance) and nobody batted an eye. It was the best decision I ever made. I got some meds. Not the detox meds but it helped me sleep and with the depression and anxiety. The first week I was kind of a zombie but hey I wasn't drinking. Then I relapsed. I made another good attempt stayed sober longer and got off the meds. Didn't need 'em...Over the course of 7(ish) months I've stayed sober and relapsed a bunch of times. I sincerely hope it doesn't happen to you but remember -- hey man there's no prizes. You're not trying to make the Olympic Sobriety Team. This is your game you make the rules. For me something finally clicked. Life is way different here on the other side and I know how easy it is to lose it. To forget. To pick up. Sucks that I had to learn the hard way but that's another one of my mantras: "now I know."..Listen though. Later I lost weight started running quit smoking changed my diet quit my shitty job and lots of other stuff. Seriously -- I said I'd get around to it right? And when you're sober it's easy to say "This thing about my life is crap and I'm gonna change it. How hard could it be? I got clean ma-fer! I can do ANYTHING."..Wow this got long. **TL;DR** HANG TOUGH BUDDY! Keep coming back. You're worth it and you can do it.
I agree with every one. You should seek medical help. I know I couldn't have made it this far without my doctor.  I suggest being completely honest. Meetings seem to help so many here. You may want to go just to try. 
Let those thoughts wear you out till you'll sleep on your own. Insomnia will it be for a while plus boredom. Accept the fact you can't have something suffer for a while. It won't be easy. Just keep in mind that life can be beautiful or miserable it's what you make it. Don't concentrate on quitting rather on how much better life is with clear mind. It's like a DaVinci painting with some horrible waterpaint over it that can be washed away. Live. Live. We only do it once.
Like others have said check with your doctor.  The only thing I have to add is that it's important to quit before you do any real damage to yourself.  More than just your liver can go wrong.  I was drinking about the same as you drinking to pass out every night for years.  I quit when I ended up in the emergency room with what was at the time diagnosed as acute pancreatitis.  It was the most pain I've ever been in in my life and I was there for eleven days.  The worst part is after hearing all the doctors say that if I didn't stop it could progress to chronic pancreatitis that would plague me the rest of my life my pancreatitis when chronic on the first go.  I will now most likely be in pain for the rest of my natural life which may even be shortened by my condition.  Get the help you need before it's too late.  Trust me on this you don't want to find out what will happen to you if you keep drinking that heavily.  I did and it's no fun at all.
