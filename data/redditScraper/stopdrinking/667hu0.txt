I was here in October and I had almost 3 months of sobriety under my belt when I fell off the wagon back in the middle of January after caving to Happy Hour peer pressure ..I don't binge drink regularly but I drink in cycles -- always building up to a big incident and then cutting way back after then building up again once the pain/guilt/shame has worn off enough from the last time. I really thought once I had identified the whole cycle thing I would stay sober but well here we are!..After having a bad day all around yesterday I decided to just say screw it and throw my lot in with body feeling like crap and giving my brain a  break.  As we all know since we're here in this sub not a great idea. Long story short I was having a straight up panic attack at 12:30 in the morning scaring my fianc  by calling him at work scratching my legs up (a weird version of cutting I used to employ) and dealing with a loud ringing in my ears all night long...Needless to say today was a tough one   nasty hangover working on around 2 hours of sleep. I just hope that I am strong enough this time to stay the course with sobriety. Last time I struggled with what I've seen a few people post about lately on here: hanging all of your hopes on sobriety. That just being sober will fix everything. And it certainly felt that way for the first couple of weeks but after that it was a daily struggle. Quitting drinking just took the veil off of all of the problems I was drinking to dull/avoid/forget and I couldn't deal with addressing those issues...This time around I am not drinking and I am calling the doctor and finally making an appointment to get back on track with life. I am so sick of time-travelling through my own life by drinking to dull the depression   I have lost like 6 years of life at this point just struggling to manage the basics. I am turning 30 in August and don't want to waste away my 30's like I did with my 20's...Sorry for the lengthy post. I love SD for the great support network you guys have here and hope to be part of that network more from here on out! Lord knows I'll need it living in a town with 20+ breweries where all socializing seems to revolve around alcohol  I will not drink with you today.
