I don't want to ask questions that are inappropriate for people trying to achieve sobriety. ..Is there a place to discuss dealing with the implications of relapse?

You can feel free to ask them here.  Hang in there.
This is a great place for support after relapsing. A relapse doesn't have to be the end of the world. 
Does anyone have any experience with relapsing on Naltrexone? The idea of drinking kind of built up to this huge thing in my head but I had a drink and ... I don't know...it's not that great and I don't know what to do.
