Gift of Gab the artist who fronts Blackalicious has written a lot about his struggles with addiction -- he's now long term sober. I found the following songs particularly close to my own experiences. Powerful and also redemptive. (Some explicit language).  ..* [40oz for Breakfast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJmIblssR9Y) ..* [If I may](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubki_G7r5rM) ..* [Moonshine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duFcHrw61Sw) ..From an interview:..'Any addict that becomes clean to a degree has to become more spiritual. To me there's not a lot of middle ground. For a person who is truly an addict in my personal experience if you're an addict you either find God or you succumb to your drug. I don't know but it's different for everybody. I say that to say I may not be rhyming about the alcohol directly like I did before. It will be more about how I'm growing as a person. Once you get rid of the substance you have to deal with why you drank in the first place. You know what I mean? It will be more geared toward that. People might not even pick up what I'm talking about because it's just human experience that everyone can relate to. '

If you listen to the lyrics of 'If I may' which is just sublime on so many levels the reference to AA philosophy is quite clear:..Here we go again  .Slip into my conscience come along an take in  .A story bout a battle in this corner Satan  .Cunning baffling and jumping into half the drink  .And suddenly disasters and catastrophe  .And acting unrationally  .Reacting savagely  .To passionately  .Bask in everlasting like escapes from just what its creating  .Jeopardizin' love  .Look at all the people that you took advantage of  .See your hypnotized  .Rom be gone take another cup  .In consequences lurk  .While the reaper got your shirt size  .Nigga wack up  .Times overdue for the birth of a power that the universe grew from   ..Wishing you all a sober and happy day. :)
*Melodica* is a great album. You know Eligh from Living Legends? He's sober for a number of years with AA.
