I hit one week sober today. For me its always been the toughest to get through. That first day especially. I have had my fair share of stretches of sobriety and longer stretches of relapse. I've been a binge drinker since I was 16 (28 now) and became a heavy daily drinker a few years back. Rehab twice. Failed jobs relationships goals. Alcohol has been wreaking havoc on my life for a very long time. But one thing always remains true for me: I will never ever stop trying to get sober.  [I recently got a tattoo](https://m.imgur.com/6wuYvmm) as a representation of my struggle with alcoholism and it serves as a reminder for my periods of relapse and my periods of sobriety. I thank you all for being here for me reading through this sub daily has helped so much. IWNDWYT
