I already feel like I'm planning what I will drink on Saturday evening :/ it's only Saturdays for me that I actually struggle with now. I just can't get passed a Saturday. ..Does anyone have any ideas on what I can do to stop myself from drinking this Saturday? Any distractions. I literally do not want to drink at all. Not even if it's only once a week. ..Anyone else struggle with certain days of the week?

And I also know that if I don't drink just for ONE Saturday I'll sail through the rest because for some reason my brains wired like that... if I do it once I know I can do it again but for some reason I can't seem to get passed it JUST once 
Maybe this will help...'Saturday' is only a concept in your mind. It's no different from any other day except what the calendar says...I used to be perfectly content home alone on a Thursday but depressed on Friday because I was 'supposed' to go out. Once I got past that mental hurdle it was easy.
I used to have this but I'm just so in the moment of the day and night that I focus on the now. And no matter what day it is I know I will be at home later sleeping well. Something I read on here was to enjoy your morning coffee. Think about the morning after your Saturday being refreshed and anew to kick ass and have a great day 
Not certain days but a certain time of the day every day. It helped me to come up with an activity or chore I was able to do at that time so I had something to replace it. Usually is cooking which helps because cravings get me when I'm hungry and idle.
