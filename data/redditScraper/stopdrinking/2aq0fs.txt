50 days ago I woke up with a hangover and said to myself: "I can't do this anymore". I decided to have an alcohol-free summer. Before that I tried to quit about 10 times but would relapse after 1-2 weeks..50 days is the longest my badge hasn't been reset and I WILL NOT relapse anymore. I feel so much better. I went from 176 to 161lbs. I rarely think about booze anymore. I have a burning desire to change my life and accomplish my goals now. I'm becoming a better me. ..It's all been just my own motivation and doing things (no AA or sponsors). I started to grow and drink wheatgrass I switched to paleo diet and work out at least 4 days a week. I try to eat as much local food as I can. I take lots of vitamins and supplements. All of those things have helped me immensely to deal with withdrawal and be healthier. ..However the biggest push towards sobriety has been this subreddit. Knowing that you're not alone in this is soo important. Thank you all for sharing your stories and experiences. Please keep posting!!!

Sounds great! Always keep in mind that should you need it or just want to at least check it out (just 60 free minutes of not drinking) AA will be there for you it would be cool but you can't earn 2 for 1 sobriety points by going it alone there may be someone there that needs your help and strength...Congrats on 50 days! 
Dude you sound like a guy that has seriously changed his ways.  Stick to it! 
Congrats on 50 days!
