30 days sober today and I already feel like an old-timer on this Reddit sub! ("I remember when I used to drink and I...).  :-)..In all seriousness I have found this support sub to be tremendously helpful encouraging and inspiring.  There are so many of you who are struggling through their first few days or months and so many who have been sober for years that chime in with some great pearls of wisdom for all of us.  ..I think I'll celebrate with a chocolate chip cookie (or two!) when I get home tonight and remember that I have a lifetime of sobriety to fight for and enjoy...Thank you community!

Well done.  Keep it up!
I am such a broken record. I wonder what life would have been if there were social media when I first tried to get sober...does no good to pine over what is gone though...Congrats on 30 days! Keep stacking them up!
Congrats! May it be the first of many happy months and years.
I'm like totally addicted to salted chocolate chip cookies made by this bakery near my house that's only open on certain days.  Yum!..Oh and congrats on 30 Days!
Congrats!  This community is one of the best on Reddit and has helped me tremendously...One day at a time as always.  Keep it up!
Congrats and keep going no matter what!
YES! Congrats!
Me too!
Every day I wake up I start the journey again.  No drink today. 
Chocolate chip cookies sound like a great 30 day reward. Congrats to you!
High five!! You get all the cookies! Keep it up :)
