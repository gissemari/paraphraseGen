.4 years of pounding back whiskey (about a litre a day) thought I was invincible. Little did I know the damage I've done. I'm 29. Recently engaged. This is the time for to stop. See my fianc  in the ER room was breaking watching her see me tremble holding my water and struggle to eat. This was my wake up call. My health my future and my family depend on it. Thank the  for reading.

Hang in there.   
Shit man at 29 that's a very early wake up call. What was the problem if I may ask? Heart? Brain? Liver? Good luck sorting your things...IWNDWYT 
Update- blood work came.   Blood work same back. Given some value. New breath of life. I'm off the sauce forever. Nothing was worse then going to the ER and going through that but I sure am glad I went. If your through sever withdrawal. Please seek medical attention. It will open your eyes as to what this poison is doing to you. 
Good luck!  I had to take my husband to the ER because of his drinking and despite how scary it got I continued to drink with him.  I'm happy your getting help good luck 
Glad for you your wake up call came while you were so young! You can have a long healthy life!! Some of us lost 40 years to drinking. Wish I learned much younger. IWNDWYT!!
