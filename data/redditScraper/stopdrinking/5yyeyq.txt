So made it 40 days in my first real attempt at quitting drinking. I wasn't completely sold on the idea of never drinking again -- it seemed like a daunting concept. But the idea of not drinking each day resonated. ..Anyway nothing special about the relapse. We had friends over and I had a couple of beers. Ditto the following the night. Nothing crazy but felt like absolute hell the next day. ..I realize that I don't want to drink every day and I like the non-drinking version of me better. ..So while I had to reset the badge I gained some perspective.
