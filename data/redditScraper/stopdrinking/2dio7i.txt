For a lot of people a month may not be that big of a deal.  Heck perhaps even for me it shouldn't be a big deal since I made it to two months last time before I had a bit of a relapse.  I choose not to see it that way however because a month of sobriety feels absolutely amazing and I feel much stronger and more confident this time around.  Maybe it's because of the horrific misery that I went through due to my relapse and subsequent withdrawal but I feel more committed to my sobriety than I ever have before...I'm looking forward to celebrating many many more months of sobriety.

Has it really already been a month? Wow! Time is moving a wee bit to fast for me lately...Way to go!
Hey this is awesome congrats! As someone who's had a month many times before relapses I say it's STILL a big huge deal! I'm glad you're feeling more confident. Good luck and keep posting!
I am so happy that you are getting traction now /u/CH3-CH2-OH.  This is such great news.
Way to go.  
I like the lightness in your words.  Congrats on a month!!..Regarding the username '-OH' is the only thing I remember from high school chemistry.  '-OH' means alcohol.
Sweet happy for you buddy!
It's one hell of a deal. One month is my record great job. This is a distance run man!
