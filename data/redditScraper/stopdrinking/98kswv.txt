Today will be my first day sober after a bad relapse. I'm moving in with my folks for a few months to get extra support. I can't trust myself being alone...Thanks to everyone in this community reading your posts is so encouraging. IWNDWYT!

Good for you for recognizing where your support system lies and doing what it takes to put it into place!  That can't have been an easy decision.
Rock on! All we can do is keep going day by day.
Good move.... and on that wagon is the place to be.  
Glad to have you.  You're among family here.
Jumping back on with you! IWNDWYT
