Hey guys. I wonder if many of you are dealing with these issues by yourself. See I don't talk about my struggles with anyone not even my wife. I'm sure it would help to find someone to share my feelings and challenges with. How have you all delt with this?

Best thing I ever did was talk to a counselor and go to recovery meetings...Here was my dyanamic I felt guilty at my indulgence I would have shame if I told those "whose opinions of me" matter.  Therefore I keep it secret...Guilt-&gt; Shame -&gt; Secrets..A deadly chain.
Oooh me too. It's been a  long 5 months. And I just moved and don't know anyone. I went to a refuge recovery meeting Friday. It's Buddhist based. Not sure if that interests you. Of course there's AA. But that is a little too much pressure for me finding a sponsor and all that. Honestly this sub is great. Are you looking to connect in person? I know smart recovery has online meetings and chat rooms. 
I come here often.  My SO still drinks so..    Some days are more challenging than others...IWNDWYT 
I don't have many friends. My SO and I work opposite schedules. I'm basically a hermit. I don't feel comfortable sharing struggles or feelings with people in my real life because they don't quite understand. ..This place here has been a really good outlet for me in that way. I come here and see that someone is going through something similar and we can come together to speak about it. Maybe find a new way to look at a situation. Or someone may need some support over an issue I have already moved past and I can give advice on what helped me. ..I guess what I'm getting at is it's lonely at times. Sometimes sober strangers on the internet are the only ones who get me and it's easier to let it all out. It has totally helped me get past alot...Hang in there..I will not drink with you today
