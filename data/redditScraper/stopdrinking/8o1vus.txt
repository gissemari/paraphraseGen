Haven't written to SD in a while. Had been thinking a lot \(as usual!\) these past few weeks about a lot of things as my wife and I continue our adventure in Brooklyn. ..It's been a wild few years for us \-\- much more wild than my previous 10 years of drinking. I've bounced around a handful of companies in the NYC market and have gone through all the ups and downs that come with the territory. I've learned so much and I have with certainty grown as a person. Now that I've quit drinking all sorts of new wonderful scary and very real things have happened in our lives and although they weren't all easy they were all real and beautiful and ours. ..A couple of weeks ago I took a job at a new company that I absolutely am in love with from day one. After a lot of effort and struggle in my life I may have finally found something that I have been searching for for a very very long time: work that I am fully passionate about. I love the world of Brooklyn and my wife and I are just so incredibly much happier than we had been in my years in the dark. Last night we went out to dinner at this really cool intimate place here in Brooklyn \-\- finding such places has become our secret hobby \-\- and we are even thinking about having a baby.....I just wanted to note something that continues to be a really critical part of my new non\-drinking life. When I first came to SD many of the "old\-timers" here talked about the importance of counting the things I was grateful for and weighing those things every day in my daily decision to not drink. I took their advice and relatively quickly started to see their wisdom...Being thankful for what I have continues to be the singly most important part of keeping my sober state of mind. I thank people profusely \-\- perhaps even sometimes to the point of overkill \-\- much much more than I ever did when I was a drinker. I believe that the people around me have noticed. It has helped me in my job searches \(make sure you write thank you's to interviewers and mean it!\) in my family life \(thank your mom and dad for being alive!\) in my relationships with others \(thank your friends when they bail you out!\) and in so many other ways. I do my best to make sure that everyone who does something kind for me knows that I truly appreciate it and I have been surprised to find how much of a difference that makes for me and for everyone around me. I still don't know if I fully believe in God \-\- the concept is one that I am much more open to although still reluctant to fully embrace \-\- but I say thank you to the sky even when it is beautiful and I say thank you to the trees blowing in the wind when I'm out on a bike ride on a beautiful day and I say thank you to the stars for being so far away and for making me wonder about everything...I have no idea how exactly I've been able to quit drinking and turn things around for myself after so many years of wasting my life. There are no "quick and easy" fixes and with certainty it is an extremely difficult task. I do know that remembering to be thankful for literally every atom on this planet has been perhaps the most critical thing of all to me.

Great post...congratulations on the new job!!.Also make sure you go to Paulie Gees pizza in Brooklyn. As a born and bred Brooklynite it's the best sit-down pizza restaurant. (2nd on my list is L&amp;B Spumoni Gardens)
