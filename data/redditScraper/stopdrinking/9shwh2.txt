I'm an alcoholic who I believe that at this npoont in my life (28.5) is no longer drinking to escape something or fill a hole.  Over the past decade of consistent use ranging from a couple beers a day to a 26 a day for 2 week binges I've meanwhile managed to grow a lot as a person and heal a huge amount of my inner turmoil from my upbringing and other things...So why do I keep drinking? It seems to be a neurochemical thing. I've been heavily addicted to xanax more than once before as well at times combining it with liquor even.  This does messed up stuff to the GABA system.  ..Anyway I've tried to quit a few times over them last year but always relapse because I simply feel like physical shit. I know the "physical withdrawal" is only supposed to last a day or two but there's definitely more to it than that. I find it's the worst for the first week or so and slowly progressively gets better but it typically manifests as bouts of overlapping brain fog forgetfulness disturbed sleep and other oddities like weird pains and/or feelings of pressure in my head that worsen the brain fog that's already there. Also moodiness and random sleepiness that just come and go. ..Does anyone have any advice to get through this easier because right now all that's on the table is tough is out or the old benzo taper-off route.  I just want factory settings neurotransmitter configuration back with as little lain as possible.....I'm about a day in and feel like I'm physically composed of burnt rubber.

The only thing that any one of us can do is to tell you to see a doctor because the internet is not a good source of medical information. We have removed your post and hope you'll seek medical support.
Almost everyone here will (or should) advise you to talk to a doctor about this. Count me among them. .You don't sound like the kind of person who will lose focus on  why  you feel like such shit and start tricking yourself into thinking it's not actually the alcohol withdrawal. Cause it's the alcohol withdrawal. Hang in there get your little raft out over the breakers and rest assured that the water is smoother out here.
