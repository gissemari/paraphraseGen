It feels wasteful to ask strangers to read about these tiny triumphs but I like to think there is someone out there connecting the names to the posts. ..This is the longest I've gone in months without a drink. I've had to start taking melatonin to help me sleep because I dont just black out anymore. But I feel better in the morning and the bloat in my face seems to have reduced. I want to stay clean until my wedding in October. The all inclusive honeymoon will be a struggle all its own...Thanks for reading. and for all of your kindness so far.

day three is fantastic congrats!! the benefits keep growing. iwndwyt!
Its not wasteful as we have all started somewhere and are all headed in the same direction. ..Your decision not to drink today is just as important as mine. ..Keep up the positive thoughts. 
You know what? I do NOT think your honeymoon will be a challenge because there is something so inebriating when you are in love and have that to concentrate on...we don't need the alcohol--we need that person.  I believe you will think of "it" and not alcohol--plan ahead and be sure your spouse know right now what you are going through so she / he will participate in the "real life" you want.  Bet they will be super happy (and turned on)...:)
