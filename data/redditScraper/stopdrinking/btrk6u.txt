Was tempted to stop last night  on the way home from having dinner with 3 of my girls. (College age and know my struggles)..I drove straight home and had a nice quiet evening.  A win but it was close...IWNDWYT

Good for you on day 3! Hang in there! IWNDWYT
That's how it's done! Sometimes one moment/event at a time. Well done. Helps you to know that you can do it again the next time too! IWNDWYT
