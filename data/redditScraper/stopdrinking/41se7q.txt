After that I was violently throwing up until about 4am Monday morning. Called out of work 2 days in a row. Missed seeing my friend of 11 years who was in town for those 2 days. Tried to meet up with her last night but got nauseous and left as she was arriving didn't even get to see her. Literally couldn't wait another minute I had to leave..Upon further inspection of my ransacked apartment (which I do every single time I drink/black out) I found my camera lens off camera flash and tripod all broken. The lens alone is worth $600. (I used to be a professional photographer before drinking became my profession.).Wine was spilled all over my new wooden table stained. Wine on my rugs pillows walls and the artwork I'd created in my 2 weeks of sobriety. Saturated in wine. All ruined. ..9 hours of drinking just cost me well over $1000. Not to mention the calling out of work(scared I won't be able to pay rent) not seeing my friend toll on my esophagus recovering and wasted time on artwork I really loved for once.....and here I am wanting to go buy some more wine..*Deep breaths*...One quote that got me through the 2 weeks was the one by Shia Leboeuf:.."If you're tired of starting over stop giving up."...

Glad you're here. I'll take some deep breaths too. What's your plan for the rest of the night?
That's rough dude. You never have to go through this again if you don't want to. Find a meeting call a friend. 
That's really hard...yes deep breaths.  I make a practice of thinking before bed of someone whose post has made me think feel compassion for and/or strive to be like.  I'll be holding you tonight.
Sounds painful but I think you need to accept it and get back on track. You can do this. 
Go get a favorite Non alcoholic drink you really enjoy  hold it in your arms and say to yourself "I am CHOOSING this over wine  because I CHOOSE to care!"   Drink it slowly and enjoy the non alcoholic taste 
I like [this](http://imgur.com/ghqRXIl) quote and this [one](http://imgur.com/ynGH0Y2) is for moment being. It is okay to just take a moment breath gather yourself and know we are here for you!
We're here for you.
&gt;"If you're tired of starting over stop giving up."..Damned straight...Remember:  Rock Bottom is *wherever you decide to stop digging.*..Take things one day at a time  L0uiel0uiel0uie keep us in the loop...We believe in you.  Rock on.
We all make mistakes. Don't beat yourself up about it. Deep breaths. I'll be thinking of you.
Hardest part is breaking the cycle for a couple days
