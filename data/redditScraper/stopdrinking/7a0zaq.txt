[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy Hump Day! What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** The night before a long trip when I was all packed and ready to go there was a massive rainstorm in the Adirondacks and a ceiling leak in my mother's house soaked the floor. I managed to mop up the mess call a roofing company and then reschedule the trip. This is one of the things I love most about sobriety when things go wrong I can *deal*...**Struggle:** My struggle is constant home upkeep like fixing a leaky roof...**General:** I have gotten so tired of seeing supposedly-humorous signs about drinking such as the one that said  If you're going to drink all day you have to start in the morning.  *Groan!* But then I saw [this charming sign.](https://i.imgur.com/c6k87l9.jpg).
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph: I made it to 1 week for the first time in 10 months and feel positive I can continue doing this...Struggle: I can't stop eating (especially sweet things) and I haven't started exercising yet! That's the easier struggle the hard one is knowing I can't fix everything but I can deal with things/problems/ageing parents better when sober even though I sometimes want to blur them out with wine...General: I am blessed with amazing family who have no idea of my problem and am looking forwards to a night out with my husband to a show courtesy of my ( usually self absorbed 18 year old ) youngest daughter as a thank you for all we do for her  
Triumph: On day 4...Struggle: I am worried about tomorrow night.  Staying with a friend so she won't be alone. She is a big wine drinker and we always sit and drink wine and talk for hours. I'm afraid I won't be able to resist. I am personally going through a very traumatic event in my life.  I feel like I will never be happy again.  What difference does it make if I drink or not if I'm never going to be happy again? ..General:  Trying to cope. Roller coaster :(
Triumph: Had a heart to heart talk with my AA sponsor yesterday. We agreed it was time to part ways. I think we parted with love and respect. It will be good to see her at meetings. .Struggle: My sweet little rental house on a beautiful creek in Northern NY flooded yesterday with the heavy rains. The placid little creek is raging. Flooding took out the boiler and water heater. Lots of maintenance money on property disasters this year..General: I am fortunate to have these properties and the (dwindling) resources to maintain them. 
Triumph: day 3 of sobriety didn't partake when my wife had a glass of wine while dishing out candy to the trick or treaters!..Struggle: Day three has been a struggle for me historically and Work is quite stressful at the moment...Overall: ready to kickass not drink with you today and tackle a challenging day of work!!
Triumph: I called my dad for his birthday and it turned into the longest phone conversation I think we ever had. My dad is not one to just chit chat but there we were shooting the shit for like an hour. It's like something has shifted or opened up in our relationship and it's pretty cool :) ..Struggle: I need to really get better about setting limits for myself. Sunday afternoon I did nothing but watch netflix. Last night I stayed up too late playing a game. It's ok to do these things a little but not when I start neglect the real things that need to get done. ..General: One of the places we go to play trivia at has a chalkboard sign they recently wrote on "If you're looking for a sign to drink here it is."  I'll just assume they mean drink club soda. 
**Triumph:** I've come out of a spell of depression. It feels *good* to be productive and on top of things again (as on top as I ever get)...**Struggle:** I started one of those personal/growth weekly challenge things to charge up my recovery. Two weeks in and I'm 1-1. Turned the second assignment into an albatross. I wanted to do a good job get positive feedback make an impact... instead I procrastinated and built the procrastination into an issue. I'll give it another couple weeks and see if the challenges are for me...**General:** One of my yoga teachers is an incredibly sunny person. Lots about smiling in her classes. Yesterday is was "smile because the day ends in "Y"". I chuckled extra because I'd always associated that phrase with drinking.
**Triumph:** Since I stopped drinking my credit card bill is several hundred dollars lower. It opens up a lot of different options for me big and small. A small thing: I got a haircut yesterday! I haven't actually gone to a barber/stylist in years and when I went yesterday I forgot how nice it can be. Between the wash/rinse and the conversation it was a good experience. I'm still figuring out how to style my hair as I let it grow out (the goal is shoulder-length) but I'm glad I found a stylist I like...**Struggle:** I want to bike to work more but with how hectic my schedule is I can only do so a couple days a week. I'm not concerned about dropping temperatures (yet) although I still need to outfit my bike with fenders and figure out the best setup for my hands/feet without breaking the bank. Curse you east coast weather...Also my hairline keeps receding. There's nothing I can do about aging except to keep my head held high and take care of myself so I age well. I work with kids and they say I look older than I am (I'm 25). I know it's just a part of life and I know I'm not that old. I just wanted to vent about it that's all. ..**General:** My birthday is at the end of the month so I have to apply for government healthcare today. I'm not excited about it especially with the way thing are going with our government (I'm American). Such is life...I won't drink with y'all today!
Triumph: I'm not drinking still...Struggle: My Fiancee is 15000km away and we won't see each for maybe 12-18 months...General: I'm going to watch stranger things and exercise
A lift of my cup of Morning Mud to you on this fine morning Mary...**Triumph**: A wonderful 8-day silent meditation retreat last week with Against the Stream and Refuge Recovery folks as well as time with a dear friend I hadn't spent time with in a couple of years.  I definitely was not ready to come back...**Struggle**: My mind. It never fucking shuts up.  I can count on one hand the number of times in those eight days I  had moments of respite from the monkeys living in my attic.  *And* I just found out that my SO is moving back in for at least a month and likely longer after a knee replacement and need to move out of the space he's been living while we're on sabbatical.  It's pushing the question of the big D to the fore...**General:** I'm so glad to be back home with my pup.  I was reminded of how much I love the desert and how much I love actually inhabiting my body.
**Triumph**:  I wanted to get drunk and hand out Halloween candy to trick or treaters....didn't do either! Watched baseball with the porch light off instead...**Struggle**: Injured my back at the gym and need to take a while off to heal.  That has been one of my major outlets and distractions so I'm kind of pissed off about it...**General**: Closing in on 40 days on my badge - how'd that happen already?! 
triumph: seeing "nov 1" on the calendar and feeling proud of myself for entering a new month with 3 sober weeks under my belt. i can't help but play the tape forward and look forward to enjoying my first sober holidays in years. i can't remember last christmas eve and i was hosting!..struggle: my mom is coming to town this weekend and she always brings a liquor store along with her. i haven't spoken with her about my non-drinking yet although she will notice and most likely comment. i am a tiny bit apprehensive not due to temptation but due to the visit... truthfully i've been avoiding her for a while now...general: have been out and about and getting in a ton of exercise and generally feeling much healthier as a result. i'm feeling now how i wanted to feel a month ago! that makes me happy as well. 
Let's try this. .TRIUMPH: after getting drunk last night I found you guys this morning..STRUGGLE: I embarrassed myself again last night in front of friends and family..GENERAL: Cautiously hopeful if you have done it I can to.
Triumph: starting to forgive myself..Struggle: still need time to mend relationships.. have had a couple small cravings but they passed as fast as they came...General: feeling pretty good about everything/ don't want to die
I've really been struggling with my 'relationship'. In sobriety I am finally having to come to terms with the fact he's abusive he's an addict and I can't save him or fix things. The cycle used to cause me so much pain- I'm stronger now I can handle it but I still need to get out and it probably won't be pretty. Honestly it's not driving me to drink it's just life. I just can't wait to be free so I can be myself again sober and in control and moving forward. Sorry for the sob story I am taking a day or two to feel sorry for myself. I'll get back up and fight soon! 
Struggle: I think about drinking all the time. It's always there whispering: "just have one drink you will feel better." Sigh...General: It's bothering me more and more that Mom's keep saying they need a drink when talking about their kids. I used to be that Mom... not cool...Triumph: .- Chores getting done around the house every single day since I've stopped drinking? Check..- Do I have more energy and am slowly coming around to actually excising? Check..- Do I have more patience and energy for my very high energy ADHD child who is almost a teen? Well for the most part... soooo CHECK! .I will not drink with all you amazing people today!.
.
**Triumph:** I'm also having home upkeep issues at the moment but my triumph is like yours - I can deal with it!  Jumping on the electrical issues we're having and not letting it bring me down...**Struggle:**  I'm frustrated with myself that I still struggle with not giving a partner the benefit of the doubt and instead still react with frustration to a perceived situation unfairly punishing them without checking in and asking questions first.  My expectations get in the way of having clear vision and the willingness to ask questions.  But at least I can see this and work to make change!..**General:** Back on track with teeth care and glad to be going to the dentist today. Little things.
**Triumph:** this week I spoke up for myself twice. These sorts of things makes me incredibly nervous and I usually avoid them. But I said my piece at a shoe store where truly crappy work was done *and* I had an exchange with a friend about being treated unfairly...Even tho I let go of the outcome and was only doing this to practice not being a door mat (!) the outcomes were even better than I thought. Both situations were resolved!!..**Struggle:** Energy and moods have been low therefore reaching for anything has been high -- Netflix chocolate even had a cigarette. But I did not drink! I'm accepting every day as it comes and every feeling. It's all OK as long as I don't drink...**General:** Reflecting on friendships and relationships in general -- where to put my energy. Grateful for true friends old and incoming! That includes you lot here!! )
Triumph: I have my health. This isn't particular to today but two colleagues have had some news about illness recently and I am grateful that I am relatively physically healthy. ..Struggle: I have a target to make at work and I keep falling below it and whilst trying to complain to another co-worker about it today I nearly started crying. Hormones probably. I hate being this unhappy though. .General: This time in 2 weeks I will be on holiday which is a blessing but I'm worried about the alcohol.
T:  I passed my second exam in a row!  I'm three for four this semester...S:  Not getting enough sleep.  I'm working on it!..G:  At clinicals there was a flyer floating around about an event.  It was for a get together at a bar and in big bold faced type it said "Man Up" on it.  This is wrong on sooo many levels.  It is a very good example of how normalized alcohol use is in our culture.
**Triumph:** Besides making it through the four days of Halloween sober I also went to only my 2nd concert since I quit drinking. It was a band that I've seen many many times and have hosted raging all night after parties for but this time I was able to stay sober and ended up having a blast.  .**Triumph part 2:** At the beginning of the show I was feeling stiff awkward and very self conscious (this is usually where I would already have 6 beers in me and have no cares) but I just tried to relax and get into the music (fake it 'til you make it) which must have worked because at the set break I got hit on by a very attractive younger woman.  Turns out she is an ex-lover of the lead guitar player whom I know (lol) plus I'm married and she and my wife have hung out (lol x 2).  So we had a good laugh followed by a  great conversation which would not have happened if I had been my normal drunk-ass self (she doesn't drink either so we were on similar wavelengths)...**Struggle:** Struggling with habitually future planning for the worst instead of living in the here and now (which is pretty good and could certainly be a whole lot worse)...**General:** Daylight savings time is this coming Sunday.  I am not a big fan of waking up in the dark and also getting home from work in the dark. (I know: first world problem).
The good news is that I've stayed off of alcohol. The bad news is that I've been thinking of alcohol today...Argh!!
Triumph: I've almost completed my 4th day! I've been here before in the past and made it nearly a year before a 5 month relapse and I've gained a better understanding of the nature of my problem through this...Struggle: I've spent a lot of the past few days deeply reflective and very emotional. This of course has made me want to drink to suppress it. But I absolutely will not. ..General: Not sure if this is supposed to be specifically drinking-related or not (?) but I'm seriously considering keeping a foster puppy I currently care for! I've been struggling with it because I already have a dog but on Sunday this week (after my last night of drinking/getting virtually no sleep) I looked at him in my extra-sensitive emotional state and realized how much I deeply love this little guy  ..Thank you all!
Great things happen over coffee.  I love that sign. ..**Triumph:** I have not smoked a cigarette in over a month.  I'm really pleased about this.  I'm still vaping and have dialed my nicotine level down to 3 mg and will gradually decrease to 0 over the next month.  I'll be nicotine free by January.  I HATE being a smoker and smelling of cigarettes the cough the expense the stigma.  I've struggled with quitting for years.  This time I'm not taking that first puff...**Struggle:**  Still having trouble with the marriage.  After 14 years I'm feeling done with it.  I'm not happy but that doesn't feel like enough of a reason to bail.  But then sometimes it seems like the only reason to bail.  Just sitting on it for now.  I don't feel like I should bring this up to my partner until after New Year's.  Kids' birthdays Thanksgiving and winter holidays and all...**General:** Chocolate.  All the chocolate.  I think I have a problem.  I just can't buy more than a couple of small pieces at a time. I eat it all.
