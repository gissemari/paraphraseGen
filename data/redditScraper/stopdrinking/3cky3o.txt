Hey guys! I just registered to go back to college in September. I have about 6 classes left before I can enter the two year RN program. I've been thinking about what I want to specialize in and it just hit me! Why not work at a treatment center or a hospital specializing in substance abuse recovery? I know what it's like to struggle with addiction and it would be an honor to help rehabilitate people who are struggling with what I've struggled with.

Wow that's terrific!  I am so proud of you.
this is awesome! I thanked the nurses daily for the care they gave me at Hazelden! Listening to people gripe about their health takes a lot of patience and selflessness! 
I'm currently in training to be a counselor! It's been so rewarding! !!!
There is a good post on allnurses as to why this is an idea with good intentions that usually falls short. Basically the nurse-patient relationship is entirely professional and medically based. A nurse on a detox unit mostly gives out meds assesses for physical withdrawal documents and maybe does formal teaching on the physiological effects of addiction. It is not like a counselor-client relationship. Your patients should never know that you were an addict and honestly you aren't going to have the time for much one on one anything with the number of patients detox nurses get...Anyway. Maybe I am just too jaded from my own nursing career.
