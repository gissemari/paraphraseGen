I know the life I'm meant to live and alcohol can't be apart of it.

Any similarities in the two relapses as far as places or thoughts or whatever?
That's the same way I'm looking at it as well. I know who I want to be and I'm not that person now. It seems ridiculous to wait for that person to appear when I know what I need to do to make it happen. 
Just gets in the way it does.
You know who you are... keep asking your subconscious to help you get there and it will happen...In fact it's probably working on it non-stoop but there's quite a lot of programming to re-write so it'll take a while. The best you can do is give it as much help and time as you can.
What are you doing to support getting well? There is more to it than simply not drinking.
