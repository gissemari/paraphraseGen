How do yall fall asleep?? I used to drink at night to help me fall asleep and I've gone cold turkey and I really struggle falling asleep now. Any suggestions?

It takes a few weeks for your sleep schedule to straighten itself out.  Avoid backlit screens avoid caffeine try to get some exercise.  Melatonin helps a lot of people.  If you can't sleep rest.
Exercise seriously. Exhaust yourself. And if you can't sleep distract....don't sit and get angry or think about drinking. It will get better and soon you will start sleeping like a normal person. I always thought I was a terrible sleeper and that alcohol helped me sleep....not the case. Put on a relaxing podcast or music to distract your brain just enough to get off the "I'm not asleep yet" obsession....that also helped me. Good luck!
What really helped me was/is one of the early anti-depressants called trazodone. It doesn't do much except make me drowsy which along with some melatonin gets me to sleep. Also I don't try to sleep until I feel tired. I usually get to sleep between 12:15 and 2:00 but I just let it happen in its own time. After a while I started waking up on my own around 7:30 8:00. Good luck!
Now I just fall asleep when I go to bed without any problem.  When I first started my sobriety I would stay up until 2:00 or so watching movies and drinking herbal tea until I was tired enough to sleep.  I'd wake up at 07:00 to go to work and the most amazing thing was that 5 hours of sober sleep beat 8+ hours of drunk sleep hands down.  I'd be tired in the morning but not worthlessly hungover.  ..Just give it time and don't try to force it.
