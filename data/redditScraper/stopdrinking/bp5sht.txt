Day two of not drinking. Really struggling. I've made it more than two days before. I don't know why it's so hard tonight. Gonna try to crochet some more. Thank y'all for your encouragement!!  It means the world to me and I don't even know ya!!

You got this!
Just think how well you'll feel tomorrow!
You can do this the first steps are the hardest.  Iwndwyt.
This day two again for me as well and I've also made it more than two days before.  I almost caved after a rather heavy discussion with my partner but IWNDWYT.
Hang on! You can do this.
We are in this together.  IWNDWYT
When I stopped I took A LOT of naps.  If I felt stressed and tempted I slept.  It helped me tremendously.  I'm two years sober. Keep fighting.  It's so worth it and you can't even imagine how free you will be.  Good luck.  I'm pulling for you.
Hope you made it! Early bed works too.
Day two is so hard but day three starts to ease up on you! It did with me for sure! You've got this!
Keep going one step at a time. IWNDWYT
