How did I make it to 42 days? I know it's a weird number to post about but I've just been so caught up in actually living instead of drinking that I forgot to keep count and it caught me off guard to actually see the number. It's been a bit since I posted but this community has still been a huge help...I still struggle with accepting an alcohol free life though. It's hard to think that I can't just "fix" myself and become a "normal" drinker. My biggest challenge will be next month when I go to a few concerts I've been looking forward to. I have never been to a concert without having a drink and am certainly nervous about the situation. For now though I will keep up with these good habits and not drink with you today.

I've got a concert I'm really excited about coming up in a few weeks and I've gone to one without drinking either. We'll see how it goes. I think I'll be good with water though!
If you think 42 flew by just you wait.  Getting caught up in sober living is a good thing.  Congrats.   Don't drink at the concerts.  Can you hang with another non drinker or be the DD?
Woot! Not drinking with you tonight!
