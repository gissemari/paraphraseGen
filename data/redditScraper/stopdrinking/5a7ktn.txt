I'm sick getting drunk and neglecting friends. I'm sick of getting drunk and being careless. I'm sick of getting drunk and wasting money wasting time and treating my self terribly while I just get more and more depressed...Last night I went to a college football game at the university I graduated from just last year. I heavily drank. I declined phone calls from old buddies I cussed a lot started smoking again... Nothing good came out of what was supposed to be a good time...I once achieved the feat of 45 sober days back in January/February. But I relapsed and I have nothing good to show for it. ..I hate who I become when I drink. I get frustrated ignorant of others and just all around a bad person who I know I am not. It fuels my depression it makes me hate myself more and it quite literally awakens what I feel like are demons inside. That is why.....I will not drink today.
