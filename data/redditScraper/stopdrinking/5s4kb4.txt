After a MASSIVE relapse I have had my first sober day in months after averaging around 15 drinks a day. I've been anxiety-addled since I got out of bed but I don't regret taking this step. I'm worse off in my life than I would have been if I never started drinking by a longshot...Here's to tomorrow. Your stories have been a great help pushing me in the right direction.

Congrats!!! Keep it up.  Just one day at a time!
You got this!
Welcome
Same here looking forward to day 2 of not drinking.
I won't drink with you today. 15 is a lot. Do you need to see a doctor for withdrawal? A bit of Valium for a few days would make it much safer for you
Someone already said it but don't let your pride stop you from maybe seeing a doctor asap. ER or urgent care. 15 a day is a lot. They can help with the anxiety and help you adjust without shocking your system.
Sorry for a delay in response guys. I was working today. With regards to your concerns about withdrawal this is about my third serious attempt at sobriety and my daily average of consumption  has been the same at each attempt. Its usually a day or two of shakes sweating diarrhea  and severe anxiety. This time around is no exception. Yesterday was rough but I'm feeling much better. The anxiety will come and go but the physical symptoms seem to be waning nicely. Only reason I sweat today was because I was busting my ass at work. I look forward to participating in more discussions with you guys thanks for the kind words!.
Looking forward to seeing '2 Days' in your flair. Keep at it.
