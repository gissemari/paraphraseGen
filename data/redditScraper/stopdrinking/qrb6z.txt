I'm in the first stages of sobriety- a newcomer if you will.  I haven't been struggling too much with the desire to drink more-so dealing with the mental and emotional highs and lows of this new lifestyle...*Long story short I relocated up north to move in with my mom and her  fiance so I could better focus on my studies to finish up my last two classes.  It eventually came out after a few months that I have a drinking problem and now I've admitted it and am working through meetings and the steps with the help of a sponsor who I am so glad to have met that first night I attended.*..Aside from that my mom and her fiance have told me recently how proud they are of my initiative effort and proactive measures in my steps towards recovery.  Talked with them earlier today after a meeting one of the first instances where they seemed okay/receptive with me being more open about my feelings and shares/experiences with the meetings so it's been a pretty damn good day...Both drink nightly which typically isn't a problem for me to be around.  This coming week I have a lot on my plate school wise with quizzes exams a report due- not to mention still playing catch-up with reading that fell by the wayside when I was drinking.  ..*I guess to give context of part of the source of my frustration after attending a few appointments with his doctor my mama's fiance decided to stop drinking for 6 months about a month ago.  He took a break last weekend when we went back east for an early St. Patrick's parade celebration.  The night we flew home and got back he had a drink- skipped out Monday but Tuesday on he started back up again (though my mom and I are still under the impression that he is intending to start up his break again but with St. Patricks day coming up perhaps he is just prolonging it).  Anyways I'm accustomed to having a surplus of all sorts of alcohol in the house and the two of them drinking (irish catholics and all) but tonight got weird...*..So I'm in my bedroom studying and feeling good about the day and the work I've done for school.  I finish up a week's worth of discussion questions so I go out to the kitchen to re-heat my coffee and socialize for a bit.  I walk down the hallway to a bit of a strange sight- my mom's fiance is sitting in the living room all lights turned off in front of the tv- it's turned off.  (The only light is that which is reflecting through the window from the back steps outside where my mom is).  I can tell by his glazed over eyes that he's a bit into his cups.  He again mentions how proud of me he is and starts talking about my classes and how I'll finish up the one at the city college soon so I'll only have the online one for another two months.  I correct him and tell him it's the other way around; it takes him a little bit to register this after I repeat myself.  My mom is out smoking a cigarette on the back steps (when I came back from meeting with my sponsor at 5 she had a tall drink poured) so I put two and two together and figure she's probably lubricated as well.  So I ditch my effort at socializing and head back into my room; my mom comes in shortly after knocks on the door and I say "hey."  She puts her pointer finger to her lips and whispers quietly "shhh.  You have to hear about the conversation **** and I were having tonight; we'll talk tomorrow."..OK now it's confirmed she's under a little bit- I know her tell signs (the whole being secretive thing whispering quietly but not really that quiet).  So she kisses me goodnight turns around and a little off-balance heads into her room.  Shortly after **** knocks on the door to say goodnight again mentions the proud thing (gets repetitive when he drinks) and heads into their room closing their door...So in my head I just tell myself to ignore the glazed over eyes and out-of-touch with gravity balancing acts and go back to work- when I hear voices being raised-  my mom can provoke unwanted reactions at times especially when booze is involved with the two of them.  He takes the reigns and I hear only him with a raised (haven't heard them yell ever it just escalates) and frustrated his voice over who-knows-what. (I contemplated turning down my music to try and hear what the hell they were arguing over at this hour of night but decided it would be better for my sake if I just tried to ignore it.)  ..I hear the bedroom door open (our rooms share a wall and the doors are right next to each other) and judging by the footsteps he walked out and headed out the back door downstairs to his office to cool off I presume...Stuff like this has happened before where their lines of communication get clouded after alcohol is involved (it happens when they are both sober but it always gets pacified before anyone gets too upset).  Someone makes some passive aggressive comment (strong personalities) and the other takes it and runs with it- they almost feed off each other; I don't get interactions like that. ..So I'm still here in my room just frustrated at the inconsistency of the two of them.  Economically I'm not in a position right now to move out anytime relatively soon (it'll be a handful of months).  Both are strong personalities and I just don't know how to bring this up without seeming to be particular about their relationship or the affects of alcohol on their communication.  Normally this would be the type of thing that would have me going through the liquor cabinet for a shot (or 4) of whisky to just forget about it but that is not my reality anymore nor does that even sound appealing...I guess I'm just reaching out for another soul in this subreddit.  It's too late to go out to a meeting or call up a friend.  I considered going out for a walk but I'd rather not take the chance of running into either of them right now.  So I'm self-medicating through classic rock and anyone who is willing to read this epic post of a rant.  ..On a good note I just noticed my badge is now a level 2.  Man those numbers next to my username give me an extra skip to my step on those days when I'm searching for some confirmation that I'm doing the right thing.  ..**tl;dr- I just wish that tonight my support system (mom and her fiance) would have acted toward each other (while drinking) in accordance with their kind (mostly sober) words of praise they expressed toward me earlier today  :/**.
----------immediate responses--------

Up late and checking the computer...I guess this falls under "things you can't change"...when people drink this is typical of the shit that happens. It sounds like a tough situation but if you keep doing what you have been doing you'll get through. I'm sure they genuinely are proud of you too but that doesn't make them change overnight in respect to things like the kind of semi-drunk bickering that you describe. ..Dealing with difficult emotions is definitely hard when we just took away our number 1 (well our only) coping strategy which was to drink. It takes a long time like years to really learn how to do it or so say people who have a lot of sober time. If I knew what to do beyond what you already are doing I'd eagerly share but I don't. 
Congrats on staying sober through the hard times. I'm at around the same number of days sober as you and I'm dealing a lot myself with some of the same issues you seem to be going through. Not in the sense that our situations are the same but in the sense that I'm starting to have a clear enough head now for all the problems frustrations and difficulties in my life to really come to light in a way that didn't happen when I was drinking. ..In the past I would have done the same as you and reached for the booze at any sign of trouble. However we both know that doesn't solve anything and have both made the decision to consciously face our issues instead of running. Easier said than done though right? ..It doesn't matter if I'm having a tough time with my girlfriend if I'm forced into situations where alcohol is around me and making me uncomfortable if I'm stressed about work (or the lack there-of) or even if I'm just dealing with all the bullshit and regret I set myself up for and put others through in my years of drinking (scumbag brain: *Hey! Remember all that stuff? Man you were a goddamn asshole. Good thing you're sober enough now that you are starting to remember it all! Ha!*) ..All this stuff is just now coming to light in my consciousness and fuck-all if I know how to effectively deal with it right now. I don't know how long you've been drinking but I've spent the better part of the past 10 years running from myself through drugs or alcohol on a near daily basis. Now my emotions are coming back in force and its overwhelming... on good *and* bad occasions. ..Didn't land that job? Fuck... this sucks. What now if I can't forget about it with some shots? ..Landed that job worked a long but fulfilling day made some good money all without feeling hungover and out of it? Now you're glad to be at the end of the day knowing you've given it your all and as such are proudly exhausted? Fuck... If I can't relax on the couch with a nicely mixed drink now what?..I wish I could offer more advice but I just wanted to tell you that you're not alone. I can't speak for everyone but everyone I *have* talked to has said this is par for the course in early recovery. I've found that a few things help: meetings talking to my sponsor literature exercise posting here etc. But none of these things make us innately more capable of handling these frustrations at least not at this early point. Our go-to coping mechanism in the past is gone and good riddance. But that doesn't mean another one has immediately resurfaced to take its place. Only time will make us better at that but just remember that we're on the right course. ..Best of luck.
