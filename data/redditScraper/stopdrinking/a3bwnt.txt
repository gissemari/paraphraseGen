When I quit drinking back in August I had a couple of what I  will call moments that stood out. I wanted to mention one of those moments as a reflection today. One of the places I would drink the most was at concerts. In the past few years I've seen my favorite band about 20 times. So when I quit I went to at least three shows and did not drink. Someone I know pretty well only through these events noticed I wasn't drinking and talked with me at length about sobriety life in general and his personal struggles both with alcohol and family health. Anyway he finished that conversation with a bit of advice. He said "Be Good. Whatever you do in life be good." This really kinda blew me away. First I never expected the depth of insight and the genuine care this man shared with me that evening. I have thought about that conversation that advice and that night many times since. I interpret it as if you are going to try something new continue to do something or stop doing something do it well. If it's new get help practice get better at it. If it's old keep striving for excellence don't get complacent. If it's something your quitting replace it and get good at it. In other words never settle for half effort. Never let yourself be satisfied with less than your best. Be Good. I don't know this simple statement that I've heard so many times before from parents and family through the years took on new meaning for me that night. In that moment. So more moments to follow as reflections in the next few days for sure. Have a great day everyone. IWNDWYT!..Be Good...

UGH I LOVE THIS MORE THAN I CAN SAY it's when these little phrases or...when you hear something from someone and it just sticks in a way like never before. Be good.
