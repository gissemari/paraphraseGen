My wife had to nudge me awake. She isn't feeling well and our son was crying in the night which is usual as we have a small one. I was having a dream. A DREAM! That I was already holding him and was wondering who was crying lol. Guess I'm finally sleeping heavy from just being tired and not drunk. I awoke with him this morning as well. Bright and chipper just as he. Got him and I ready at the same time while getting breakfast going and brushing our teeth together. It was the nicest morning I've had in a month since my last relapse when I had 70 days.  The  little  things really are what inspire me. Getting ready with my son for our days adventure and being fully there during. Feels good to not have to shake off the night before as I attempt to change a poopy diaper while gagging!

That's great! IWNDWYT.
Beautiful. Moments to treasure. I hope to be emotionally present for my kids through not drinking. IWNDWYT
This is what's really driving me to stay sober; being present for my kids. No more weekends hungover taking ibuprofen chugging Gatorade and eating like crap just to feel better. ..Waking up at 6am and having a cup of coffee alone is an amazing thing. I'm able to map out my day and get ready to be a productive member of the family. ..Keep up the good work. 
This is the best gift you will ever give to your child.
