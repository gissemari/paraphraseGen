I am only on my 2nd day it's lunchtime and I'm feeling pretty low about how I've been over the last 9ish  Years I've taken a long hard look in the mirror and realised how stupid I've been deep down ive always known i have a problem. But I never wanted to accept it until now. My boyfriend gave me a hug this morning as I couldn't stop crying i asked him why he sticks around i don't drink everyday but when I do I can't stop and obviously he worries about me and shouldn't have to put up with it I'm really struggling to deal with the guilt the last time I drank was two days ago on my boyfriends birthday i got so drunk that I had to go to bed and he was on his own he's put up with this for almost 6 years i am not doing it to either of us anymore..I have so many reasons to quit. Time for a fresh startno more self pity. This sub is so helpful reading other people's stories and knowing I'm not alone and I'm not a bad person the sober me wouldn't upset anyone for the world but the drunk me only cares about the next drink.

Welcome Louise!  Congrats on day 2!..I was a binge drinker; I didn't drink often but when I did...I couldn't stop. I kept chasing the elusive initial short-lived buzz. It never came back and I just got horribly drunk. ..Alcoholism is a progressive disease. At the end I was still binge drinking - *but every day*. It snuck up on me and I was downing a fifth of vodka a day...Take solace in the fact that you're not where I was. Your boyfriend sounds Awesome and supportive. He is with you because he loves you and sees the real you. You are worth it. The way alcohol makes you feel is not worth it. ..I see in your post an INTERNAL awakening to change. That's HUGE! The only way things will change is if you are ready want them to and willing to put in the work. Not drinking alcohol is only a part of the problem for me it was my escape from problems that were still there. I needed to commit to finding my vision of where i want to be and who i want to be; then i have to put things into Action. Your feelings of despair are hard right now but even small steps eventually will get you where you want to be. But it's up to you; you have to be the driving force for change in your life and support from others will be instrumental in your recovery...{{{{{hugs}}}}}. Keep coming back to family here...*we get you!*
Good for you.You can't change past behaviors and decisions but the future is yours.I gain a huge amount of strength from SD. I will not drink with you today.
You're doing great. First three or four days are hard and you're doing everything you need to be doing. Hang with us as much as you can/want reach out if you have any tricky moments and trust that you will feel clearer and stronger soon. You really will. You're making it happen. &lt;3
