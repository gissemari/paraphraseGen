This is the second time I've had to reset my badge so the third time I've "stopped drinking." It wasn't like I went crazy with hard liquor and blacked out. I had an old friend come into town and well before I could say no I was four beers in. I won't say I particularly feel bad about it because I would have turned 4 into 16 beers but I did break my sobriety so I am back to day one. He was 100% understandable about why I felt bad about the 4 beers I drank and we ended up having a very heartfelt conversation. Yes this counts as a relapse but my biggest take away from this is that I was able to stop myself before I got out of control. IWNDWYTD.
