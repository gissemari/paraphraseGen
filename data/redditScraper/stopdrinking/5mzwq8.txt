...and then I relapsed. Nothing like the holidays spent with dirty laundry gossip mongers called family to make you feel like you need a drink. ..I didn't get black out drunk as I usually used to. I simply had enough to get me to that 'high'. I didn't need it but I made a choice. 202 days down the drain but definitely a lesson well learned the lesson being that I don't need a drink when dealing with family I need space. I don't consider this event to be a complete loss. I consider it as being a step forward in the right direction. I've seen what could happen if I let every little criticism get to me I've lived through it. Now I see this as something to learn from.

You have the right attitude. Learn from this misstep make the adjustment come into your next situation better prepared and succeed. All you can do is move forward can't do shit about anything else but your next decision and for that I will not drink with you today.
I commenced my fight against alcoholism in 2016; I lapsed on 3 different occasions. Keep your head up. From the people that I've talked to who've quit drinking successfully none did without a few relapses or slips particularly at the start of the fight. ..As one SD subscriber put it: **Never quit quitting!**..Good luck and I will not drink with you today. 
Other people don't make me feel anything.  I choose to feel it.
I don't think anything is a bad thing if you learn from it.  Great job getting right back up and coming back.  That takes real strength.
Those 202 days are not down the drain. You now have a glimpse of how far you can go.
