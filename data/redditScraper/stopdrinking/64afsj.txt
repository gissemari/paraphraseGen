One of the guys who has caused me to relapse in the past was my barber. He runs a barbershop. I was about to go say hi to him as we were becoming friends at one point... ..I realized that the timing was close to when he would order us to go grab a bottle of whiskey (around his closing time). ..I was literally around the block from his shop when I decided to turn around! I thought that the risk (timing saturday night etc.) was not worth it!..He's the type of guy that's lame until he puts a few drinks in himself. We would end up getting into a fight if I said NO I don't want to get a bottle of whiskey lol..I'm going to take a nap and go do something else later with some friends who won't force me to drink! ..I ain't drinking with you all tonight! 21 days tomorrow! :-)

Wow! Congrats. I know that's a good feeling and tomorrow you will be soooo much more proud of yourself. 
Nice looking and planning ahead on your part!
No one can force me to take a drink or cause me to relapse.  My sobriety is my responsibilty to protect and defend.
