&gt; I just don't get it. I was doing so well every day was great..You also said: ..&gt; Got sick of trying to fight the cravings in fact for about a week leading up to the relapse the anxiety I had about the possibility I might drink again was effecting my life almost as bad as booze was. I was constantly thinking about it constantly planning my next drink..There are people who are rather fond of saying that relapse begins long before a person takes the first drink...You saw it coming and had about a week's notice. Did you take any steps to head this off? Did you talk to anyone e.g. post to SD? ..If you didn't do anything special looking back what do you think you could have done?
Good you came right back.  You've got this.  Congrats on the new job.  Think of a plan or strategy when this happens: "Got sick of trying to fight the cravings".  Smart Recovery workbook has some great info dealing with changing behaviors.  I won't drink with you today.
There might be a little self sabotage here. Transitioning to a new job can be stressful and I don't think your timing on the relapse was a coincidence. Mark this for yourself under "my triggers... life changes" and next time a similar stressful situation is on the horizon make sure to take extra care of yourself. Talk to others and find out what strategies they used to cope and find what works for you. .A relapse is only a loss if you don't learn from it.
