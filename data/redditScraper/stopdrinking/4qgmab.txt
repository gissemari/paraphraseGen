As a student I always like to prepare for tests. I've taken the same approach in sobriety. When I anticipate being in a situation that will lead to cravings and the urge to drink I like to outline my Struggles and worries and come up with Strategies I can have on hand. I tend to catastrophize so my Struggles often turn out to be far worse than the actual event. Having Strategies prepared in advance means I'm not searching for ways to cope in the moment...**Situation**..A 10-day family vacation to visit my father and step-mom. A day and a half of driving on either side and a week staying with them in their house. ..**Struggles**..* My 20+ year relationship with my stepmom has been antagonistic more often than not.  .* Our last visit to their home was 4 years ago. My stepmom was so unwelcoming that it's taken us this long to want to make an attempt to visit her in her home again. Now we're bringing two energetic kids along...  .* Talk about personal stuff? That's NOT what the men in my family do. It's something I learned from my father. I'm getting better at discussing how I feel but not with him. Many of years of learned behavior to break through there.  .* Some of the things we want to do with the kids are very low on my parent's list and they can be very negative about the crowds hassle and touristy places.  .* I'm really struggling with frustration and anger over my oldest's behavior. I'm catching myself AFTER I react which makes me angry and disappointed in myself. There will be lots of opportunities for me to lose my patience...**Strategies**..**Distract/Delay:**  ..* Chasing after the kids is always a good way to break off a conversation or head off a confrontation.  .* Actually having a conversation about topics we are all interested in is a novel approach that I might be able to make work.  ..**Escape/Exercise:**..* Running shoes packed. .* I'm concentrating on building a daily yoga and meditation habit so will continue with that.  .* I'll have internet and cell coverage for about half the trip. My virtual and IRL support will be as close as my phone.  .* I've got the meeting list for the nearest town.  ..**Accept:**..* The last few visits I have done much better at controlling my reactions and accepting that which I cannot change...**Dispute:**..* Acceptance and not rising to the bait has reduced disputes and arguments.  .* My wife and I are prepared to leave if it's too unwelcoming. We can camp nearby enjoy ourselves and still meet for a few day trips.  ..**Substitute:**..* I've got plenty of La Croix and tea packed.  .* My dad has cut way back on drinking too. There will be booze around but it won't be the constant presence that it was in the past...

Whew!  Sounds a little intense.  I love this prep work - it's gold!  Ah and I just realized:  DEADS!  You are truly exemplifying SMART strategies.  I'm sending you good energy clarity of mind and emotions self-love and patience!!  xoxo
Seems to be a well prepared plan...and keep repeating the Serenity Prayer in your head! Have fun too. Kids will prob make things easier as they will want to be busy!
i gotta ask man how did this happen? that's a perfect storm right there. being in a car that long with kids and in the same house as step mom that long too? man do you want to live? i'm rooting for you to pull through sober!
Are there any meetings in the area?  Even though I don't go to meetings at home...I'm considering it next week when I'm on vacation and the stresses of that come up.  Good travels!
