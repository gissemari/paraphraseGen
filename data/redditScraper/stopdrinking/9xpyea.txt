I moved to a new city almost a month ago. The condition of the apartment I rented was much different worse than I was led to believe. I'm talking mold and bugs. ..Even still I was happy to be there so I went about town and took a few selfies (don't judge lmao). They were from my first day here before I immediately relapsed. Even though the apartment sucks I still had such light in my eyes.  I saw someone full of hope walking around in the sun excited to be there and excited for what was before me. ..So much different from where I am now a few weeks later. After only (and I say only because I was a half a fifth a day type before) just a few beers a night for a few weeks now I'm tired constantly. A kind of tired I've never experienced before like I wanna go hibernate. My eyes look glazed. My skin looks bad. I just look as unhappy as I feel. I'm depressed. I feel like giving up and just going to sleep without setting any alarm. Just generally  fuck it fuck it all and fuck me . I'm beyond anxious. I'm sorry to say I'm trying to taper now (I'm currently going down to one beer today then half tomorrow) since I can't afford doing this with medical help. It's just me the tapering my regrets and gabapentin. ..And that's how I destroyed all the joy in my life in a little over two weeks. At least I'm still determined. I won't let the alcohol win. My sober streaks keep getting longer and longer. Sunday will be my first day entirely without alcohol. I hope this post doesn't violate any rules since I'm tapering. I dunno. I just feel so bad about myself but I won't let myself cry because if I do I might never stop.

At least you didn't let it get worse.  Great job coming back.  If you remember what it felt like to you in order to get to that full of hope feeling you can get there again.  IWNDWYT!
I so relate to this. Alcohol = nothing matters fuck it all very quickly for me.
