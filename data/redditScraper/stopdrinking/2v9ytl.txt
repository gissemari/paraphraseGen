Hey everyone.     .Today marks 4 weeks of no alcohol for me. I'm pretty happy about it.      . .Brief brief background on me and my drinking:    .I'm 24 years old and I've been drinking heavily since 17. It hasn't "ruined" me or jeopardized anything serious really. I have a healthy relationship with a great girlfriend I am very close with both parents (who are recovering alcoholics of 25+ years) I have a decent job and work full time.     .I was always the guy to get too drunk when partying with friends. It started off funny in high school but persisted. There were times when it was uncomfortable for people around. Even if I was just with 3 or 4 close buddies having a few beers I would find any way possible to drink until I was dizzy or passed out.      .Anyway fast forward seven years of this and here I am. It was very hard at first to quit because of my social life.     .I realized that luckily I am not physically addicted yet but if I were to have kept drinking the way I was it would definitely do me in sometime down the road.      .There were times where I would walk to the liquor store and buy a 26 of whiskey and drink the whole thing alone in my room unbeknownst to anyone.      .I'd had discussions with my girlfriend and parents and was very very transparent and acknowledged I had a drinking problem but would usually finish it off with "I'll figure it out" or "I'm young whatever" etc...     ..Anyway it's tough to not do it. It's very hard sometimes especially Friday night. But man I can't express in words how amazing it is to not have hangovers! I would get full-day-long hangovers quite often. I would do nothing just lie in bed all day hurting. What a way to spend my youth.     ..The benefits I've experienced over the last 4 weeks has been nothing short of amazing:     .-Clear head at the end of the night     .-I AM IN CONTROL! No more "*ughhh why did I say that!*" or "*Oh no. No one can find out about what I did last night..*". My friends who hang out with me don't want to hang out with that drunken idiot..they want to be with ME. And now that's who I am. I am the person that made them want to be friends with me in the first place. It feels great.     .-I've lost 10 pounds already! from doing nothing but abstaining from beer!     .-my bank account!!! I would drop $50+ per night at the bar and I do not have tons of money. This is a bonus.     .-I have energy and I feel happy for the most part. Sure I won't feel happy all the time no one does but man this certainly helps.     .-Free time! I would spend every minute either WAITING to get drunk GETTING drunk or being hungover and unable to do anything. Now I've read books every day I've played music written (things I love to do) and I've been bettering myself learning new things and enhancing my skills.       ..I know that I will have very trying times down the road and it's not like the darkness is behind me. This post may sound as though my drinking was kinda willy-nilly but there were some very dark times that led me to do some pretty shitty things. It has been in my head for years and I've been struggling to stop for as long. I've been scared. I've told myself there's no way I can stop. How will I socialize? No alcohol..FOREVER? Can't be done! etc....    ..I'll take it one day at a time.      ..Thanks for listening. I hope everyone had a great weekend and has a great week ahead. .

That's the spirit! Thanks for the report and glad to read that you're doing well a day at a time. ..What things are you doing to stay sober? What's it like having some sober time with parents who are sobriety veterans?
