So today has been day 100 for me and I never thought I'd get this far. .It's not been easy but I feel better than I ever thought possible just 100 short days ago so if you're here thinking of quitting drinking or if you've just quit and are struggling stick with it! .It's amazing how my habits have changed and it's fantastic how much help and support there is here and places like it. ..So thanks to everyone who posts when you post something sometimes you don't know how much of an effect it'll have on people and I see that a lot here!
