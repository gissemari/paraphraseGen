So my life over the last six months or so has been falling apart.  Like a leper.  In an Zumba class.  I'll spare you the wall of text but it's been a parade of shit--passing of family members a cross-country move sexual assault physical altercations my relationship deteriorating money problems stress at work etc...Needless to say I hit the bottle hard.  I've always considered it a way to cope but it's not working anymore.  Every single night that I drink I can't stop. I've run into traffic trying to get away from people who were attempting to get me home.  I've woken up in a stranger's bed with literally no idea how I got there.  Came to covered in bruises and cuts on my face and body and no one can tell me how they got there.  Had the cops threatened to be called to my house.  Gotten in a vehicle with someone as drunk as I.  I've been kicked out of bars.  I wake up every single time hung the fuck over with this feeling of heart-breaking guilt.  If my relationship was damaged before it may be unsalvageable now.  I've lost most of my friends.  ..It was a struggle not to drink last night or have a drink before leaving for work today.  That's when it hit me.  Normal people don't talk themselves out of drinking.  They don't compartmentalize their issues to the point of justifying alcohol consumption.  I talked to some nice people in the web chat and they helped me to realize that I have a problem.  In fact just re-reading what I've written has helped me to see that this is something that I can't control.  But I know I'm not alone.  I've still got you guys...Thanks for listening r/stopdrinking.

You have us yes but there is more help out there waiting for you to reach out for it.  AA  smart NCADD and other groups.  It can make a huge difference.
Denial is what will make me lose everything valuable to me in this world.  It's not like I wasn't told I had addiction problems 7 years ago and several years before that...I just didn't listen and didn't accept it...'Look everyone I've stopped this or that drug so leave me alone about my pot/alcohol intake' - 'it's just a hurt back and only a prescription of 60 percs don't judge me because I went back for a refill' - 'i have anxiety I need this refillable xanax prescription' - 'look I'm back to only smoking pot' - 'well I'm out of pot and I'm not drinking THAT MUCH'..Just a bunch of repeated denial and it didn't really matter the substance be it alcohol or not...My story is of course different but admitting we have substance abuse problems and actually OWNING it is a VERY important part of the process of getting to a sober life now matter what your poison is...You've defined and owned the problem now build a tool belt to fix it.  Best wishes and good luck.
