I've been wanting to get a tattoo to represent how proud I am of my mother and step dad for committing to being sober and I couldn't think of a better way to. For all of you in AA you know the meaning of serenity for those of you who don't it means the ability to accept what you can't change about yourself. My mother fully regrets drinking through mine and my sisters youth and feels that she should never be forgiven for it. I love my mom with my whole heart and i'm just glad that I get to have her for my college graduation my wedding and beyond this was my thank you to her. For all of you struggling remember there's always someone in your life that needs you the sober you! Stay strong guys! ..[Picture](http://i.imgur.com/MXb1J48.jpg)

Thanks and best wishes to you and your Mom...Coming to terms with the bad things we did while active alcoholics is very hard but essential. I hope she knows that she is far from alone in having struggles with this!
Awesome :)
That's awesome man.  This battle makes you feel like you're alone she's lucky to have your support.  All the best to your family!
