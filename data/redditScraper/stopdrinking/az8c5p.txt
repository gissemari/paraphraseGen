I started drinking when I was 15 and have used alcohol as a coping mechanism ever since. I never managed to learn how to drink responsibly I just gradually increased my tolerance and learned how to behave normally while drunk. ..At 23 I started managing a bar. I'm 26 now...I made it ~5 months sober this year the first time I've EVER quit drinking. ..The first couple months were a whirlwind. I'm not an angry person but I found myself getting irritated with every little thing and I was constantly on the verge of inexplicable tears. Then I went through a period of extreme positivity motivation and productivity. It wasn't sustainable though and I dipped into depression anxiety and experienced some intense insecurities I didn't know I had. Then back up again but a little more balanced. ..The holidays came along and so did winter and I drank one night then the next and the next and so on. It got harder and harder for me to resist saying  fuck it  to taking shots with friends and regulars at work. I'm happier and friendlier when I'm drinking so why deny myself that right? ..Well half right. I'm super happy WHILE I'm drinking but at the end of the night and the entire next day I'm depressed af ashamed of myself and physically hungover because I can't stop at one or two drinks like normal people can. I also occasionally take my insecurities out on the people close to me and can't accurately explain why I'm so upset and that leads to deeper insecurity. ..I finally realized that I shouldn't be working with alcohol and decided to change my career (to what idk yet). I still have to work until the end of the month but it's been a lot easier for me to choose not to drink every day knowing that I won't be surrounded by alcohol soon. ..I'm 15 days sober today. I'm doing this entirely on my own cold turkey. I can't afford therapy and AA doesn't feel like my style fr. I'm still struggling with some depression and insecurity but I sit with it and basically give myself therapy through reflection writing. ..So far I think I'm doing a pretty good job. I've always been self-aware and able to analyze my own behaviors/thought processes. I'm still not comfortable accepting that I'm an alcoholic tho. I guess I feel like I need to be diagnosed? And using the words  relapse  and  recovery  make me flinch a little. ..Has anyone else struggled with thinking of yourself as having a legitimate problem? I have no issues acknowledging that I don't have a healthy relationship with alcohol but I do have an issue acknowledging that I struggle with an addiction which = a mental illness. Especially because I've been able to abstain without professional help...I don't want to end up back where I started because I missed a step and it's hard to talk to my friends about this because I hide my conflicts well. Nobody really knew that I had a problem; they just saw me as a heavy drinker. ..P. S. Congrats to everyone who's staying sober! This shit's a difficult choice to make every day.

*I'm super happy WHILE I'm drinking but at the end of the night and the  entire next day I'm depressed af ashamed of myself and physically  hungover because I can't stop at one or two drinks like normal people  can.*  ..This was happening to me too and I considered that a legitimate problem...I didn't bother with trying to label myself or my behavior.  Drinking was making me miserable.  I don't want to be miserable any more.  So I stopped drinking.  Just keeping it simple...Good luck in your new job.  I'm sure that will make things much easier for you.
