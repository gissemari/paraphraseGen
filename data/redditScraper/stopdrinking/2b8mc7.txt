I was very much an on-off drinker. At times I would be blackout drunk everysingle night for a month at a time and several times I was drunk all day. And other times I would not drink for a week or two at a time. I used is at as a crux for my social anxiety and depression...I posted here 2 times previosuly saying I'd give up hoping that would stop me. But when the urge came maybe 3 weeks down the line I finally caved and just got a few beers. Then I was back to square one and drinking every day...A few months ago I didn't really decide to stop drinking I just scared myself with how bad it was getting and swore to cut down. And I did  it was a 4 pack and a bottle of wine to just a 4 pack then just a few times a week then once a week. I came clean to my friends and they mostly understood and I found ways to decline alcohol if offered. And the other day I had a pint out with a friend I didn't feel a crippling urge to get more alcohol and get hammered on my own and I haven't drunk since then. ..The only times I posted previosuly here I failed miserably. But I think i'm at lest half way there now. The cravings are all but gone and it's just a mental battle dodging a relapse. So thank you all here for your indirect support the last few months and your fantastic support and advice when I did post here even If I did fail your advice was invaluable.

Good for you /u/t0mn0mn0m but I'd recommend recovery meetings to consolidate where you're at and get tools to fight against relapse.  
Glad you've found a place you're happy with-- hope you'll stick around and remember we're here if you ever find yourself needing extra support!
