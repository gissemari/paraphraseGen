Been following for awhile but this is my first post so here goes:..For at least the past 6 months the most consecutive days I've gone without drinking was a week and even that was a struggle. I'm constantly surrounded by booze and haven't had the willpower to say no. Went AWOL this weekend and lost my phone and job in the middle of a bender which also involved various other drugs. This lead to my friends and family freaking out assuming i was dead and contacting local hospitals police etc.. Found my way home yesterday to a barrage of people worried about me. So I've now promised my friends and family I'd go the next month without drinking. I feel as though I've alienated myself from my family who all casually drink at any social gathering. I feel that this time is the last straw for me its become something i think i need to give up. I've decided to see a substance abuse counselor in the hopes that that will help. Any advice or support is greatly appreciated. Thanks

You lost a lot to alcohol.  Don't give it any more.  You can do this!  I will not drink with you today.
Great idea about seeing a substance abuse counselor! With the right tools and the right support YOU CAN DO THIS. I'm here for you.
