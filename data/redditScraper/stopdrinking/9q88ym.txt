I keep having nightmares where I'm relapsing and my dreams are to the point where I'm sober me in my dreams. I don't know if being sober in my dreams is a great sign or whatever but these faux-relapses are killing me because I work night shift and when I get home I sleep really hard and long. So I just get like 8-12 hour long relapses and wake up hyperventilating thinking I lost everything again.  I assume this is normal but does it go away?

Yes dreaming of relapses was normal for me but they weren't nightmares.  They did eventually go away and they didn't happen every single night.  It will just get better the longer you're away from alcohol.
Drinking dreams are very common but I'm 286 days into this and had one last week and I'm sure I will have another at some point in time.

It gets better over time.  I rarely have them but they do crop up from time to time.  In fact I had a using dream this morning.  I've been stressed out the past couple of days so it manifests more when I am stressed.  My brain is trying to harken back to my old coping mechanism when I used to get stressed by wanting a drink.  I've learned to let it go quickly and not dwell on it too much afterwards. 
I haven't had a drinking dream in a long time I can't remember the last one I had...Except I just had one two nights ago...I had smoking dreams where I was smoking cigarettes for years after I quit...It gets better.
