I just completed an eight-day vacation in Spain with a good friend who drinks and managed to get through without compromising my sobriety. And by "manage" I mean it was the best European vacation that I've ever had...To preface this story I've spent a lot of time in Europe over the years first as a foreign student in Italy and later on vacations. And drinking was always a major part of my life there. (As it was here in the U.S. but you get the idea). Traveling meant drinking at cafes during the day drinking at dinner and drinking with new friends in the hostel.  ..So I was naturally a little nervous that I'd be faced with so much temptation or else be so miserable that I wouldn't enjoy the trip. The opposite turned out to be true. ..I hope this might provide a bit of inspiration or guidance for those of you who are contemplating a similar trip and concerned about the possibility of relapse...Before the trip I reached out to my travel companion a friend who lives on the opposite side of the country to explain that I was newly sober. I said that I did not mind how much she drank but that I wouldn't be participating myself. ..Not only did she not mind but she actually was relieved that my sobriety would give her a chance to slow down her own drinking. Once we began traveling together she told me that she had begun thinking hard about her own drinking and was considering stopping herself. I wouldn't characterize her as a heavy drinker   she's certainly not someone you'd steer toward a meeting. But it was clear that my own ability to enjoy life without alcohol had inspired her...A second advantage to sober traveling   feeling fit! My friend and I woke up each morning and worked out. Then while staying in towns and cities throughout Spain we walked a whole lot. This was wonderful for several reasons. One it allowed us to indulge in rich delicious food without guilt. Two it enabled us to see everything that the city had to offer. And three it prevented the inevitable post-vacation feeling of being bloated and fat!..And third it allowed me to savor the trip more. Eight-day trips to Europe particularly ones that involve some intercity travel tend to be whirlwinds. But I found that this trip felt much longer than it was simply because I could savor and remember every detail. I didn't come home and feel like I hardly left. That was the feeling I used to get...And finally it wasn't like my sobriety kept me from doing ... well anything! At cafes bars and restaurants I ordered sparkling water or soda or juice. Nobody cared. I still got to eat all the tapas I wanted to sit and soak in the atmosphere. And it meant that I didn't feel like crap the next morning...I admit when I walked by a Madrid plaza and saw people enjoying a cold beer that I felt "Damn that looks nice." But the feeling passed within moments. And then I got a Coke. Or an ice cream. And felt equally refreshed...Traveling especially to a country as beautiful as Spain is one of life's pleasures. If you're feeling hesitant to go because you're afraid you won't enjoy it without drinking I hope my story can give you the bit of courage you need. It won't just be ok without booze. It'll be even better...
