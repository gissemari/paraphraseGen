I was thinking about how many of us struggle at this time of year when celebrations might tempt us to drink.  So I thought I'd share my sober plans with you:..The SO and I are spending the day preparing a light dinner / snacks that we can munch on all day and in the evening we'll watch a few episodes of our favorite murder-mystery.  Finally I'll boil a pot of tea &amp; we'll spend some time in quiet reflection of the year past with the free [Year Compass](http://yearcompass.com/) tool I just found on /r/GetMotivated. ..A few years ago this would have been unimaginable to me but sobriety and time to think has given me a different perspective and I feel quite happy about the plan!..I wish you all the best on this New Year's Eve!

Sounds like a great plan! .I'm going out for Chinese food with partner then will come home watch some Netflix and watch the midnight fireworks on tv. .I'm planning to do that year compass tomorrow 
The Year Compass tool looks great! Thanks for sharing the idea.
I love your name....I'll be catching up on all the Vikings I missed out on last year!     .Yes!!! My New Years is tomorrow I feel like most people here are doing it tonight?  Not sure but I know I'm very pleased not to be drinking for any of it : ) .
Thanks so much for the resource share!  I'm actually excited about NYE now!  My husband and I are going to a very early dinner and then home to work on our individual guides.  
So jealous. I was going to have a nice dinner with my wife and then a reasonably early night. Last minute we are invited to friends  so I get go be the only sober one at the party and don't even get to eat my steak. Yay  iWNDWYT
