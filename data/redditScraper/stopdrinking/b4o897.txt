I'm so proud I didn't even make a throwaway. My struggle with alcohol wasn't exactly a secret in real life so hey. Accountability and all that Jazz. ....I started drinking at the age of 12 but not often. .High school turned into every weekend. .Adulthood turned into every day nearly. ....Sometimes I'd have a reason to drink until the bottle was gone other times nothing would be wrong I just wanted to drink just to be drinking. ...The last 30 days have been awesome. I'm more alert more in control of my emotions my fricken face is slimmer I've lost 10 lbs my kid noticed I don't  take really long naps anymore.  ...Ya'll have been a great help here. Reading your posts and perusing the comments took a lot of the pressure off of refraining from alcohol. Thanks for showing me there IS light at the end of the tunnel and I'm happy to have made it to the other side. ...I still have a long way to go but IWNDWYT. ...
