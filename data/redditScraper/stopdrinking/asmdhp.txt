Made it though 5 years without a drink so I gotta my first [tattoo](https://i.imgur.com/PxVMYwj.jpg) (forearm) at almost 40 years old. I can't believe how much better my life is now then 5 years ago  The best part of my sobriety is that my kid who is 8 now does not remember a time when I drank. I am breaking the family cycle of alcoholism. I am concerned that he may have the same struggle some day as he has lots of anxiety but no matter what happens I know that I will be a good role model. We talk all the time about why I don't drink so hopeful if he does have the same battles he will have more information and a good role model.

Great inspiration and tattoo keep up the good work! 
Wow what a big achievement! It's really inspiring. 
Using an enso as the circle was a great idea. Nicely done and congratulations on five years!
Congratulations.  Your son is fortunate to have a role model like you.  IWNDWYT.
I love that tattoo!  Super cool design!  Congrats on 5 years!!!
You're a role model my man. I hope to be like you with my daughter as she's growing up.
Beautiful!..I've been thinking of the tattoo I want for 5 years. Almost 6! I finally found an artist I like and made an appointment for the weekend before my birthday.
I keep planning my sober tattoo but I'm still not sure what I want exactly. Well done! 
IWNDWYT...Congrats!!
Congratulations on Your Sober Solar Circumnavigations!..What are the symbolic aspects of the art?
Got my first tattoo at 100 days sober on my wrist. It's my daily reminder.
I got my first tattoo while in the middle of my addiction but I've been talking about it forever. I can't wait to get my second tattoo after a sober milestone. IWNDWYT. 
My dad quit when I was 3 and I never saw him drunk. Grumpy yeah but not drunk.
Well done! IWNDWYT
how do you get the number of days sober next to your name?
Congrats on the tat and way to go on five years!
