I was going through my old journal &amp; found an entry made last year during my last attempt at quitting drinking. I was at four &amp; a half months &amp; mentioned how I struggled with obsessing about drinking still.. every day I thought about it &amp; I missed it. I didn't want to be sober. I made a remark in the journal that the only thing keeping me from drinking was I didn't want to let my friend down.. That was it...And now it's dawned on me.. This time is such a damn breeze because I'm not doing this for anyone but me. I actually don't want to fucking drink anymore &amp; it's a damn miracle. Advice for anyone just getting started from someone who's relapsed twice.. Do this for YOU first &amp; foremost &amp; the people whom you love will notice. It truly gets easier if you want it &amp; that's something I'd never thought was possible a year ago.

Noticed your history so you've been off phenibut too?...You know that only 500 mg of it is used to treat SEVER alcohol dependence properly? Like prevents seizures from intense daily vodka drinking. This is proven in the prescription literature from Russia.
