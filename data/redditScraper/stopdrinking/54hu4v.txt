I am so glad I found this post. I'm a little more than 24 hrs in and so scared I could cry. Mondays are super hard for me. After coming home from work there's my beautiful girls to take care of dinner to fix along with a slew of other things that demand my attention. Having a bottle of wine made it all doable and without it I would feel so overwhelmed. Now I'm to the point I don't have the energy I felt it once gave me..I absolutely feel like crap the second I pop that cork. I'm sick of struggling with alcohol. ..I'm worried about (as I've heard) dying from alcohol withdrawal. I don't want to taper off I just want to quit period. Is this unrealistic?

Probably depends on how much and how often you drink.  Also seems like people are different when it comes to withdrawal some have terrible symptoms while others have nothing.  If you're really worried you should call your doctor.  If you're already not drinking most of the day usually like you don't start until 4 o'clock or whenever you're probably fine to just quit.  
I can only speak from my own experiences. I've been a heavy drinker for years (20+). The last year or so I was drinking a fifth of whiskey a night. Or if I only had wine I could easily drink two liters. ..Withdrawals for me were mainly shaking sweating some confusion and muddled thinking and pretty bad tremors. ..If I could do it over again I would absolutely seek medical help. I also encourage you to speak with your doctor if you are the least bit concerned. 
Thanks for all your support. Going on 48 hrs and feeling pretty decent. We'll see!
