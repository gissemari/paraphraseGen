My parents met in AA about half of my extended family are alcoholics and a few years ago (in high school) so was I. I only joined reddit very recently and I wish I would have had this community! All of you who wrote your stories either of failure or success you are so important and are making a difference! ..I had never heard the IWNDWYT saying and it's still beautiful to see the solidarity and encouragement and hope it brings. It is such a simple statement but it joins you with others who feel as you do. Keep posting your struggles and joys here and I will not drink with you today.
