I don't know why it hasn't struck that the past is dead final. All of the wreckage. The cat accidents the drug abuse the one night stands the failed relationships with friends and the big one for me the one that really got me started using to help sleep and hopefully move on in life. All the using did was put off the heartache for 15 years and sabotage any hope for reconciliation. And this is all on my permanent record no take backs. ..How can you face the past and not get lost in the what ifs? I had been doing it for the 5 months (almost) and have been fairly immune to it looking at it matter of factly and clinically almost like studying history but now the reality of actually having to feel all of that shit at once and forever without a redo is absolutely killing me. ..I'm hurting real bad...edit: to put a bow on it I feel like Jay Gatsby refusing to believe that I can't change the past

I'm perplexed by these cat accidents you had.... ;)..There is a line I really like in AA (even if you don't go to meetings). "We will not regret the past nor wish to close the door on it."   The idea that we can face what we did in the past without that overwhelming shame. I still cringe when I think of things I've done but it's less and less as time goes by and I build more solid positive sober time. Dwelling on the past serves no purpose. You can't make things right by punishing yourself and reliving the bad deeds in your head. You have the choice to move forward instead.
