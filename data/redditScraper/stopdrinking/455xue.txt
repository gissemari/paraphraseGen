Hello dear people..After posting for the last time when I hit one year I have been eagerly awaiting my chance to talk about another number that feels like an important milestone..For context: I am now 24 finishing my BA in a social science degree while working part time in a university research project. When I stopped drinking I was studying abroad dealing with a heart wrenching breakup as well as a huge hangover. I had done what I was so used to doing before: drowning my problems in alcohol and numbing myself..Against all odds which for me meant the supposedly inescapable student drinking culture plus my reputation as a party animal I quit. Binging on SD mood swings munchies both irritation from friends and strangers ensued. Later I attended AA meetings to get a taste of where I stand but also to remain accountable to others. It was powerful to say the words: I am an alcoholic...Fast forward things are not perfect. Instead they've gained depth and I am slowly making my way back to earth. Without the help of SD and later a counselor at my uni I wouldn't be where I am. My new found energy gave me the guts to see a therapist and finally start talking about was bern bugging way too long. Dealing with my parents break up and the following depression-drinking spiral my mum got caught up in. My procrastination and unrealistic goal setting for work. Now more recently my social anxiety and fear of doing anything but pleasing people vs. strong selfishness...Yup I still forget my grand mothers birthday. I still don't see my dentist even though I should. I still withdraw from friends and family when the clever thing would be to ask for help and comfort. I am worth it...I nevertheless got better at studying finally started reading again (what a difference! all those years without books) excercising once in a while working my jobs being more reliable and honest. I still go out dancing joke with my friends and occasionally get involved in a little romance. Sober sex is so much better. ..My bank account grew which means I can now think about doing trips or buying a book things I spend my money on without hesitation. Everything but drinks. The amount of cash that I wasted makes me cry yet I can't change anything. I sleep better and whenever I get sick I wonder how I could do with all those hangovers since age 16...All my worries about friends or society not accepting mr turned out to be either too large or way different than expected. My exprience: the friends who like me accept my decision. The ones who remain sceptic or cynical must be kept at a distance or go. The oned I thought who could drink in huge quantities and be fine they most likely aren't. For me it's often difficult to see people with similar struggles so most of my new friends turn out to be non drinkers...I am still over thinking worried about my future and the job market for young anthropologists out there. Therefore I need stability in my life and I am doing the right thing. Today on day 500 my everday life took a blow because my grand father died of cancer. What I want to say is that this won't change my drinking habits in the slightest. Death is a part of life and I will grieve decently without any substances in between...Thank you for letting me ramble a bit before I go to sleep. Thank you for being there..
