Good Morning/Afternoon!..*Theme:* Motivational..**"Always do your best. What you plant now you will harvest later." - [Og Mandino](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/o/ogmandino164003.html?src=t_motivational)**..*What I get from it:* I look back and I know now how crazy it was to think this way but 6 months ago I thought I was 1) too young to quit drinking and 2) not drunk enough to stop drinking.  I think both of those thoughts kept me drinking for a long time; I know I am not alone in thinking this way and that this is something many of us struggle with.  But today I am much more aware of the fact that I was not at all too young nor was I too "good at drinking" to start this journey.  [Everything I am doing today](http://www.eatingbirdfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/dosomethinglarge.jpg) is only going to make the years to come so much sweeter for me and my loved ones.  Maybe I could have lasted a few more years living the way I was living....but why do it when I can do this instead?  Doing what I was doing was getting me nowhere fast; these days I have a fighting chance at having a better life and spreading that joy to everyone around me.  So I am going to keep doing the best I can at this bc even if today isn't the best day ever [maybe tomorrow will be a little brighter bc of what I did the day before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1AesMfIf8).  ..Have an awesome day all!
