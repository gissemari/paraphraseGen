Eighteen months ago today I woke up in a rehab facility. The day before I'd had my last drink in a McDonald's toilet stall because I'm a lady. ..&amp;#x200B;..It's wild to celebrate 18 months just before Thanksgiving with its family-style drinking pressures. I'm making sure I know where the meetings are before I travel to visit inlaws and I'm taking breaks from the mandatory merriment whenever possible. ..&amp;#x200B;..Drinking with people isn't what I crave. It's drinking alone and disappearing in plain sight. My therapist tells me I need to find reasons to enjoy life sober so that I'm not tempted to relapse. I have some ideas like looking forward to returning to graduate school next spring. And maybe giving more of a damn about my appearance. Does anyone else have any thoughts to share about how they made their lives worth living sober once they sobered up? What have you stayed sober to protect?

Running is a great motivation for me to stay sober and I know it helps a lot of those suffering from addiction. I train for races map out a running season.  It gives me a goal something to look forward to.  ..Congratulations on 18 months! IWNDWYT
