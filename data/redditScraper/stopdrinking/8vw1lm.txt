So as a few of my posts in my history show I have been struggling with this for a while. I can never seem to stick with it and after a breakdown with my wife on Sunday I finally went to a therapist for an initial meeting and to come up with a plan. After the meeting we decided I am going to do a once a week for 26 week group session as well as at least on AA meeting every week. I feel like this is the first real step I have taken towards sobriety. I have been sober for two days and I look forward to another sober day tomorrow...IWNDWYT

Fuck yeah! 
Seems like a good plan to start.
