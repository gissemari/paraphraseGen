Anyone experience this? Is there a sub for addicts? I am in NA and am trying to work the program right this time but am struggling with finding a higher power. I have been looking for a sponsor for help with this but have not found one yet. Thank you for any help you can give.

Hello and welcome. Congrats on fixing alcohol. I'm sorry hear about the drug addiction. I know several folks here are breaking both addictions...I found this link...not sure if opiates are the problem but maybe there is some useful help: https://www.reddit.com/r/opiatesrecovery..Best wishes to you!
Hi there!..Sorry to hear about your new problem. I can't relate but SMART recovery is for any addiction even behavioral ones. Their website has online meetings a forum and a chat that I've used many times to get me through cravings and difficult times. I prefer SMART over AA myself...Good luck! Please keep us updated!
