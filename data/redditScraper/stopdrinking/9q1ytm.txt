10 days sober and relapsed last night. There was an event at my kids school and I drunk one beer. Then 2 3 4. Got back home and drunk 2 more. I'm trying not to be mad at myself and want to understand what triggered me to take the first beer and how I can avoid that in the future. Anyway today I'm sure that IWNDWYT

I always focused on the steps to the first drink not on the triggers. When you wanted to have the beer did you have to get up walk somewhere order it and take it into your hand or did somebody just give it to you? I consciously interrupted myself a few times before that first drink when I noticed where I was headed. For me that was much easier than working on triggers.
