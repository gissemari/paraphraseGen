I relapsed yesterday. Hurts to say that...Of course I could not sleep last night because of the anxiety and guilt. I spent the night pacing around and thinking...In the past I always tried quiting because I knew I had a problem and could not drink like a normal person - but that reasoning was not enough for me...I've realized I've hit an ultimate low in life. I'm missing cherished moments with my child because of drinking. I have also drove drunk a few times which is horrible and I can't stop thinking of the lives I could have ruined. There's no changing those mistakes I have made unfortunately but I need to learn from them and use them to turn myself around...I'm at my rock bottom but there's no where to go but up. I will continue to rely on SD for support when I feel weak and I hope to stay sober for myself and others. ..Feels good to get that all off my chest. :)

Glad you are back. Day 5 feels so good for me. I too have drove drunk and it is terrible. We are all lucky to be alive and free. I am afraid to go back and face the consequences. Always harsh consequences and very little reward. I wont drink with you today!!! We got this.
You can do it. I think most of us wish we could moderate but it takes awhile to realize that for whatever reason we aren't those people. Whatever's done is done and you have a lot to look forward to. Check in here often; it helps me stay sane and get advice :) You can do it! I will not drink with you today.
