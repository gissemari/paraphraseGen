I am a serial relapser. I got the pink cloud feeling when I was super young and went sober for 6 months. I was probably 21 (I wasn't an alcoholic then either). ..Over the last 5 years I haven't gone longer than 6 weeks of being sober but never felt the pink cloud feeling. Will I ever get that again? I am expecting after 3-6 months sober I will be FEELING a lot better less anxiety a clear head etc. Just want some input on the timeline of feeling good again

Better than pink cloud. Usually takes a couple years. I've been on cloud nine forever. You can be too if you choose to.
I've managed 4 months sober before and never got the pink cloud which is probably why I fell...My brain doesn't understand that the lack of a bad thing is good. Selective ass memory.
I'm still waiting and couldn't be happier. Don't know what the pink cloud is but I sure as hell remember the dark drunk cloud. 
Sobriety is a subtle feeling for me. The last few times I drank were very anticlimactic I just woke up after a crossfaded night thinking "last night's party was lame I'm gonna give up alcohol" and only drank two more times after that...I never get really excited about being sober but I could see a drunk person doing something stupid and be like "glad I'm not like that anymore" or right now I'm spending a Friday night by myself at home and I'm thinking about how much more calm I am compared to how I'd be drunk or high. I can feel my mental state getting better too not just from giving up alcohol but every other recreational drug including caffeine and diphenhydramine both of which I'd take every day.
I've never had a real pink cloud. But along with getting sober I have had to deal with a lot of life events...I am doing a day at a time and trying not to think ahead.
