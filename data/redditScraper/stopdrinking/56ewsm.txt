I just left my first home group AA meeting after a relapse completing my goals for the week of reconnecting with my doctor going back to therapy and going back to AA this week!..I was really nervous about seeing my friends and picking up another 24 Hour chip but I'm so grateful I did. I went back to work before I was ready today and am emotionally and physically fried. It's exhausting to pretend everything is okay around co-workers who have no idea I'm an alcoholic ("How's your week going?" "It's great! [I spent a drunk car ride home with my dad raving and drooling Monday night threw up for hours when I got to my parents' and spent the next two days zoned out on Valium because I had the DTs so badly that I couldn't function"]). Work ramped up my anxiety really badly but thankfully I got a pep talk from my mom on the phone talked to one of my friends and made myself go...So grateful to reconnect with friends SD and to be sober on a Friday. Hope everyone is having a good night!

Glad you're back! I'm here after a relapse too. I'm not drinking with you today. Fall down twice get up three times.
Nice work getting through.
Sounds like quite the whirlwind! Glad you're here and working through this with us!
Keep doing!  One of the long timers on SD said that to me once.  It is simple and correct.  Recovery requires work and action.  I am going to keep staying active in AA and SD because you know what?  It works for me! :)
wow some week..glad you're here and posting!
