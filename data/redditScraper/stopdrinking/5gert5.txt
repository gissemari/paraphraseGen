One of my favorite Authors is Marian Keyes. As someone who struggled with alcoholism she is able to put a realism when writing someone who is struggling. I'm sure most of her stuff might be considered Chicklit but most of her books seem focus more heavily on overcoming things and not the romance...One that touched me was This Charming Man when one of the characters is struggling with alcoholism and pulls up to the liquor store without even realizing and starts to get a bit frantic because she can't stop herself from buying alcohol. It came out years after I quit and it still was so identifiable. She also is pretty talented at speaking from the other side of the fence as a family member of an alcoholic. Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married is so accurate it hurts. I've read all of them cover to cover in the double digits...Just a forewarning though they can be pretty emotional reads. They helped me with staying away from alcohol but there is casual drinking in the books too that I'm sure might be triggering for some. The accurate portrayal of alcoholism is something that kept me from going back. ..It is also so great to see someone who struggled be so successful in a field I always wanted to get into.

Another non-selfhelp novel that I liked a lot is: "The girl on the train" by Paula Hawkins. The main character struggles a lot with alcohol and the reader becomes (painfully) aware how of her life gets destroyed by that.
I think I am going to read girl on the train next
