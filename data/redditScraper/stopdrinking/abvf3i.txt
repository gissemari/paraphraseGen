Today is my one week mark. Iv been sick with a cold and it hasn't been to hard. I think I have blamed all my side effects of quitting on my sickness which has helped me to not drink. In all reality I think me being sick is actually a withdrawal effect and I'm in denial about how much my body actually relies on alcohol. My face is breaking out I've been having vivid dreams and sleeping horrible.  Anyways going into week two I know will be more of a struggle as my husbands home from work and we really enjoy drinking together. Thankfully he is incredibly supportive and we have quit together.  Any suggestions on couples activities we can do at home?
