And going strong!  But really struggling with insomnia and completely unable to get up at a reasonable time..I used to go to sleep early and get up at 5-6 without an alarm and feel fine..But now trying to live sober I can't fall asleep and I wake up exhausted and feel mildly hungover and can barely get stuff done during the day...Wtf this is the opposite of how life is supposed to be right??

Your body is in the process of making some major adjustments. Hang in there it'll get better. Some things I know help me get to sleep. 1. Cut out all caffeine by 6pm.  2. Go to bed at the same time every night.   3. Turn of all electronic devices thirty minutes prior.  Good luck keep it up. I'm proud of you for reaching out instead of reachin for a bottle! 
Patience!..There's something called Post Acute withdrawal syndrome and it's pretty real. There's also something called wicking and it's the longer you go in the more times you go back the worse the hangovers are...Stick with it man it gets better. 
I drank for quite a while.. I did not expect to be a brand new person instantly.  But I did heal faster than I thought possible.  Time friend!  I rewarded myself for not drinking.. since I wasn't spending on booze I bought books nice food a new bed   is there something you can do to make the transition more comfortable and enjoyable?  Maybe you like to take walks or run or volunteer.  11 days is a huge deal!  I'm proud of you I know how much effort it takes..I will not drink with you today 
I posted almost the same thing this morning..Are you have crazy vivid dreams?..I will not drink with you today x
