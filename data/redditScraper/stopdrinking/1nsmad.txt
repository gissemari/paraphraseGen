30 days since I had my last drink. It took a lot of bad decisions to make the step and it hasn't been easy. This is the longest I have went without in years. I am 36 and it is hard to remember when not drinking was a choice and not a struggle...I also had my gallbladder removed this week and a liver  biopsy performed. At the least we know I have cirrhosis and will find out how bad this week...I hope all of you can sustain not drinking. I have chosen to go one day at a time and it makes it easier. This is a great place to lurk and see that I am not alone and thank you all for that.

Welcome! I am sorry to hear of your health problems and am sending healing energy your way.

One day at a time works. Keep it up.

Don't know how advanced your cirrhosis is but I've seen some pretty bad cases improve over time if you stop poisoning it. The liver has some remarkable healing powers given the chance..
