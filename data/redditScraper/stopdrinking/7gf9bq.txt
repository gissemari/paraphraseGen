Today is my day off from work and the first day that I've felt better. I had a terrible GI bug over the weekend and it takes me awhile to bounce back because I have a terrible belly. (GERD)..I abuse alcohol and I know what path I am going down so I am stopping my abuse of alcohol. ..Today I'm struggling. I am having lots of thoughts about alcohol. I'm cleaning my house floors dishes laundry dusting and I'm finding the cravings pretty intense. Might I add I'm also a smoker when I drink....and I'm not smoking cigs either. I'm sure I'm craving both at this point!  ..I'm posting this to hold myself accountable and I will not drink with all of you today. I want to live a healthier lifestyle and I will accomplish this. I accomplish anything I put my mind too!

I'm impressed you're trying to give up both drinking and cigarettes at the same time! When I crave alcohol what helps me is calling or talking to other sober alcoholics staying busy going to places where there isn't drinking (like an AA meeting). I hope this helps. xox
Good job staying strong! I've not been as strong as you. I've found that having a cigarette when an intense alcohol craving hits helps so I've been using that to curb them. One demon at a time. At this point the cigarette for me is a much smaller demon than alcohol.
You can do it just stay in touch with this group or go to a AA meeting. IWNDWYTD!
Thanks for sharing your determination!
