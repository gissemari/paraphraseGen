My brain is trying to rationalize drinking again because I can't remember what it feels like to be drunk..I just want a little taste....I know drinking will have a negative impact. ..Blegh.... Dumb.

Keep avoiding it just remind yourself what led to you getting sober... Horrible hangovers wds all the bad stuff.  That's why we don't drink because we want to succeed! Good luck not drinking with you today :)
Take it slow remind yourself that this too will pass. 
What can't you remember? The spins the puking the hangovers... or the fun times that happened to involve alcohol? I think it's important to recall *all* of it the good and bad. Maybe there are ways to have the good times with out the alcohol.
Thanks you guys...Didn't end up drinking haha.
