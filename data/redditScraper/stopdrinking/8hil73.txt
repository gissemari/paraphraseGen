Day 3 here. Just something I've noticed. It's hard to not be an asshole starting at around 4:00 ocklock. My girlfriend was trying to help me last night and I was short and rude in return. She's supporting me and for that I'm thankful. ..For anybody else struggling with this as well I find a hot shower helps around this time. I can play some music and try to forget what's going on which sets me up for a more relaxing evening. ..It's funny how as my alcholism became worse I started drinking earlier and earlier. "Oh its 7:00 ockock! I can drink now." That turned to 6pm then 5 then "when the hell will 4 o'clock get here. So on and so forth. ..Just wanted to get some stuff on my chest. I Wont drink with you today.

It's really good that you have realised this it's hard to be an arsehole when you know you're being an arsehole (if that makes sense!) I also use random showers whenever I need a few minutes to myself or to calm down a little bit :D I will not drink with you today
I second what /u/nomoreginger said - and I also will not drink with you today...FWIW - I've taken to just going outside and doing *something* (anything!!!) when my daily raging asshole phase starts. Somehow just being outdoors and focusing on something has been helpful. YMMV!
