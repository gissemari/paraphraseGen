I've been struggling.  I'm not a home drinker never have been.  I live a 'sober' lifestyle except about once or twice a month I find myself going to some bar to have one then it turns into 10.  That is followed by 2-3 day hangover and total self loathing.  .  .Well this last Wednesday I did it again and in a bad way.  Basically blacked out with a few key moments returning.  One where I'm falling down somewhere one where some bartender somewhere is telling me he can't serve me.  One where I'm asking if my car was towed but really it was just parked where I had left it.  There is a good chance I shouldn't show my face around about 3 bars for about a year.  .  .My lack of tolerance and age (42) means that now I just turn in to a miserable creature when I drink that is the most unattractive version of myself.  .  .Anyway it's now the third morning don't feel sick anymore.  Not worried about the badge reset until I get a month behind me.  .    .IWNDWYT

Glad you made it back here and I appreciate you sharing the news. You're always welcome in the SD community...IWNDWYT
I am the same. I had two weeks clean and went out last night. I am 49 and drunk me is not pretty. I will do 30 days with you! 
I relate to this so much. I'm 48 and we never drink at home but once a week go out and I get blackout drunk and feel like crap for the next 3 days. Then I feel better for a couple days and repeat the cycle. I absolutely hate it. My badge is wrong now because I drank on Thursday. I still feel bad. I hate how thoughts of drinking consume my life. It's exhausting..I will not drink with you today.
