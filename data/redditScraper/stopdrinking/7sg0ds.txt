I own a second home in New Orleans...This purchase was made deep in the depths of my alcoholism  which obviously still exists.  While I love the city  it's really hard to be an alcoholic struggling to get sober there. Really really hard. ..I didn't make it.  I really wanted to but I didn't. ..I currently live in a city where alcohol is a little more tightly controlled than most cities.   While I know that pulling a geographic or running away from your problems is not possible it has seemed to really help in early sobriety.  So I'm glad to be back home. ..Jesus... another badge reset.

I have often wondered if I can ever go back. My best friend's dad owns a mansion in the French Quarter. I've been down there a few times (before I quit drinking). I had my bachelor party there during Fat Tuesday. It is a magical city...I just don't know if I'll be able to handle it.
Go for the food and avoid bourbon street. You can go to a lot of great restaurants there and all you'll be thinking about is the food coming to your table
Actually went to college in NO and one of the reasons was that at the time the drinking age was 18 there as opposed to 21 everywhere else.  Didn't work out too well for me.  Well life has but my most serious drinking manifested itself in high school and college.  Love certain aspects of NO but it sure was an alcohol friendly city.  I have the scars to prove it one on my chin.  Oh well.  Those were the days IWNDWYT.
