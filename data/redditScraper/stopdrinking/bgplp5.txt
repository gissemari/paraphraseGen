I'm 29F I post from time to time on here and it's been a huge help for me since I quit drinking this past Valentine's Day. Well about two weeks ago I started feeling AMAZING. A ton of energy (I'm talking reorganizing all my closets and drawers by color coordination at night waking up early to go shopping before work cooking big dinners everyday and just being very energetic in general which is a big deal because when I was drinking it took everything I had to get up before 2pm if I didn't have work and I pretty much did the bare minimum all day. My energy was just zapped. Also I've been in great moods 90% of the time. I use to be notorious for mood swings high anxiety and petty tantrums. I still have anxiety but I can handle it so much better than I use to...Well I was curious if the euphoria after quitting alcohol was a real thing and I came across an article by AA about the "Pink Fluffy Cloud" feeling. They said it's dangerous and doesn't last but for a couple months then when it goes away it's easy to relapse. I'm pretty bummed now after learning this. For those of you who have quit drinking for a very long time what was your experience with this?

I went through kind of a "pink cloud" - it looked a lot like what you're experiencing although I didn't recognize it at the time. If I were to assign numbers to the feelings the pink cloud time was a 10 in terms of me being happy excited energetic etc. and prior to when I stopped drinking it was around 6-7 on the scale. Now that the "pink cloud" is sort of gone (I think we get used to a new normal and there's nothing bad about that!) I'm at 8-9 on the scale fairly continuously. Still waaaay better than before I quit drinking but maybe not the "honeymoon" phase of the first two months. ..As for relapse I think it's something we need to always be aware of and planning to avoid pink cloud or not. I wouldn't say I felt any more tempted to drink after the pink cloud dissipated and in fact I have felt less temptation as time goes on. I wouldn't let any of this bum you out. You're heading into an amazing future where you no longer have to experience hangovers or brain fog from drinking. That is a wonderful place to be!
I think that just being aware of it is a huge advantage. .I personally never had the pink cloud I just felt like day old dog shit all the time and that slowly got better. ..Some of the guys I was in rehab with did have the pink cloud and we were quite strongly warned about it. When those guys started coming down from the cloud the ones who handled it best were the ones who took the warnings seriously and treated the pink cloud as *part* of their recovery and accepted that it wouldn't last forever. The guys who were the worst off were the ones who hitched their wagon to it so to speak. Despite all warnings they were adamant that the good times wouldn't end and banked their sobriety on it. Unfortunately one or two of those guys did relapse while still in rehab.
