This is my first Sober Summer in about 3 decades and this past weekend was my Trigger Zone of all trigger zones. My sister my Dad and my Uncle all celebrate their birthdays on Aug 3 & 5 respectively and there's always a big gathering to celebrate.  ..It's up at the lake and there is feasting and bonfires and every year it's been a great excuse for me to get cross-eyed. I was really stressing about it because this was my first Birthday Weekend sober. I've also been struggling with cravings and I was determined to face this head-on. I didn't know how I would handle being around a large number of my drunk relatives while I was sober.  ..Well guess what? They weren't drunk. As it turns out they may have had a moderate glow going but nobody was hammered. Then I found out that in past years they weren't hammered THEN either. In fact all these years the only one getting hammered was ME.  ..Here I was stressing about the weekend and all I got was positive feedback from my relatives about how happy they were that I was sober this time around. It was great and really made me think about what a fool I may have made of myself in the past. I can't change the past but the weekend went very well and I can't wait for next year.  ..So for those of you that are feeling trepidation about hanging out with people that you used to drink with ask yourself are you certain that they were drinking as much as you were? If not when you show up sober they might be very happy to see it.

Great post!  It's amazing how blind we were before.  I remember being so adamant that drinking wasn't **THE** problem.  It might have been **A** problem but definitely not **THE** problem...Yeah.  I was wrong about that...Great job PJMurphy!  Keep it up!
Great job!
Congrats PJ. It's always great to read about people facing up their triggers and learning something about themselves in the process. Keep it up!
Eye opener indeed what an experience. Thanks for sharing and keep up the good work..
Awesome. I'm glad you made it through ok!
Love it. .
Just posted a little while ago abut the same thing - how suprised I was when I realized that I really *was* drinking more than everyone else. Going out with friends and getting a sober look at how *differently* their drinking is than mine was eye-opening for me. Just shows how clueless we are when we have that single-minded obsession.
nice post!  keep it going it will only get brighter tastier and more vivid from here!
I hear ya. I was actually surprised with how restrained some friends/family were when i quit drinking.  Also tend to be "the Life of The Party" so would always get people to "loosen up" and drink with me which made me feel better because in the morning I didn't have a hangover ever and could give them shit about drinikig to much. (because i didn't stop drinking for a single morning for 2 years).  It took me a bit afterwards to realize alot pf people werent drunk having fun with me..... they were having fun while i was drunk...edit: in our minds it is unfathomable that people can have fun like that without atleast having a few or 10 or in my case a fifth before noon and a fifth for nighttime to avoid a seizure and all the other signs our body gives us to tell us to cut the shit.
this made me giggle..;...so **MANY** people don't drink like I used too
Woot!  There's a heavy dose of reality there....I know exactly what you mean.  I recently had to participate in a team building event at work which was essentially a booze cruise.  I found myself noticing how much everyone drank over the 4+ hour period.  Maybe 4 or 5 drinks a piece and they were all pretty happy buzzed....The old me would have easily killed 10 drinks an hour.
Great story thanks for sharing. ..The next 2 weeks are going to be rough for me as I'm throwing a bachelor's party going to a wedding and having my kids 2 birthday parties (they were born 1 week apart. 4yr and 1yr)..At each of these I will be seeing people I have not seen in over 6 months (Navy keeps me away) so they will want to 'catch up'(drink)...I'm a little less worried after your story as now that I think about it I was the one pressuring them to drink.
