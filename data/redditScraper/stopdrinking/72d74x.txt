Today marks the longest I have gone without drinking for the better part of 5 years! I have struggled with my new job for a few months now and really let it get to me especially when I abused alcohol. This last week however I have just been having fun at work for the first time in a long time. The cravings are real especially at home on my downtime but I've been doing my best to stay distracted. Today is my day off and I'm going to start off with a haircut and then stop by Sam's Club to pick up a big case of soda water. Thanks everyone for the support and I will not drink with you today!
