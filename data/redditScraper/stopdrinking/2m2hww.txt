Last night my SO got wasted drunk. I did struggle at first because the beers were right there. But then I thought of my health and all the good things I've read about on here that I have to look forward to and I want all those things for myself too. I'm only a few days into sobriety so it wouldn't have been much to start over but what I can't risk losing is this mindset I've got myself into. I finally feel strong in my resolve. I feel like I did when I quit smoking 3 years ago like finally I've had enough...And here is the story of last night if you're interested:..He had an infected tooth pulled and was in a lot of pain so I felt like I couldn't begrudge him some nice beers. I brought him the beers and made his favorite dinner broccoli potato soup and corn bread. By the time I realized he'd drank all the beers and ate no dinner I was a little worried but he started acting like a jerk at that point so I said fuck it I'm going to relax in bed and watch the tube. Little did I know he goes out drunk and buys more beer. Now he's laid out in an unheated room trying not to vomit which would probably be horrible for fresh oral surgery. :/ ..He's a good person and he'll get on the wagon with me soon he hasn't llet me self-improve without him yet. Maybe this experience will be the kick-starter..
