Well moderation didn't work. ..&amp;#x200B;..I struggle with the concept of being a non-drinker. I am afraid I will be unpopular or looked down upon. I am afraid I'll miss out on good times the riotous fun of going out with the boys and celebrating life with drinks and good cheer. I'm afraid I won't be able to attract the type of woman I want to attract. I'm afraid I'll be sad and lonely...&amp;#x200B;..I'm going to go buy This Naked Mind from the local Barnes &amp; Noble and bury myself in that today under blankies with some coffee and tea. I hear it's highly recommended...&amp;#x200B;..I'm so afraid that being sober will hold me back from achieving my dreams. Why is that? Why am I so afraid?..&amp;#x200B;..:/

I really like the Take a Break podcast with Rachel Hart. She gives tools to help with those kinds of thoughts around drinking.  
Sounds just like me. I am scared to quit totally so I call myself a non-drinker who drinks once in awhile. But the craving is always there. And once in awhile I break down. I'm tired of being controlled by an addiction. This NakedMind is good! So is Craig Beck on youtube. He's the stop drinking expert and he says it like it is. Best wishes.
Craig Beck on youtube would say because you see some value in alcohol. And it's conning us.
