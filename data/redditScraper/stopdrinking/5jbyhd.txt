I quit drinking because of anxiety. I've always been a bit anxious and had some alcoholic tendencies (binging frequent drinking can't do 'just one's etc ). One day after a hangover I became convinced that my kidneys were shutting down. Hypochondria is something I kinda struggle with but before quitting I was also struggling with as my therapist claimed "anxiety induced psychosis". Basically I wasnt psychotic because I stillrecognized fact from fiction but I was prone to occasional psychotic thought patterns due to anxiety. According to her. ...So I quit drinking because I heard sobriety is the way to go if you have a panic/anxiety disorder . Almost instantly I felt better. I was doing better my paranoid delusions and weird superstitious behavior stopped and it was great....Last night I went out with friends. I decided to drink so I wouldn't have to tell them that I quit-- I figured I've been doing well. Anxiety isn't a problem anymore and Ill drink in moderation. And? I did! Totally moderate. ...And then the fucking anxiety struck. Like while I was drunk I became convinced I was about to have a heart attack. I went home and started worrying about a nuclear attack from North Korea. I fell asleep and had super vivid fucked up nightmares. I woke up at 5 am and was kind of better but couldn't get to sleep because I was a little bit afraid that there was like... A ghoul or something. Waiting for me to close my eyes. All today I've been nervous and twitchy too. ...Looked it up and apparently alcohol induced psychosis is a thing. Not DTs not withdrawal but some folks in the population who become addicted to alcohol and develop psychotic symptoms when intoxicated and/or withdrawing. ...I'm going to mention this to my therapist (though I know she'll just say it's fine to think I have this if it stops me drinking; she's pretty dull). But I thought I'd let yall know this shit exists. ...I mean I swear it was like a switch was flipped. Crazy shit.
