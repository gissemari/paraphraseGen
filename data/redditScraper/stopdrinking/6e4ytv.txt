I've lurked often and posted sometimes you all have been very helpful I'm at Day one again my question is am I strange for wanting to grieve that the alcohol part of my life is over (or coming to an end) ? 
----------immediate responses--------

My therapist did recommend the book 'goodbye mr wonderful' which from what I've read deals with some of this
The book This Naked Mind is available for free download in the margin and it really points out that instead of grieving I am going to throw a fucking party!!!!!!!!!!!  Woo-Hoo!  Fuck alcohol.  I won't drink with you today.
Alcohol does seem to make our brains fall in love with it. It was my best friend for decades then I started on The Sinclair Method. That blocked alcohol's ability to reinforce the "love affair" and I eventually become indifferent to it. Took me about 6 months to go from a 12-pack per day to less than a 6 pack per month. I haven't had more than 3 beers in a day since last August. 
Maybe? I mean which part are you missing? The waking up at 3am sweaty and anxious the hangovers the panic attacks (I hated those) the wasted days recovering from drinking too much the fatter mid section and thinner wallet the shame the health effects the lack of motivation to do anything that didn't include drinking. The Euphoria after a couple of beers. Yeah I miss the Euphoria but it was gone long before I actually gave up drinking. .I thought I was going to miss it but I don't. Once my brain healed from all the abuse and I started enjoying life again I can't believe I ever missed it to begin. I've lived drunk and I've lived sober. I choose sober :).
