Part 1: http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/180xlq/personal_story_on_my_struggle_with_sobriety_in/%5B1%5D%5B1%5D..Previous Part: http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1905ep/four_ounces_of_courage_part_5_honesty/..**somewhere over the arctic circle**..I opened my eyes after finally passing out sometime after take-off. I was calm no sleep terror paralysis this time thank god. I unbuckled my seatbelt and walked closer to a video monitor to get a better idea of where we were. We'd just passed over the North Pole headed for Russia. I was so glad I finally found my way to sleep. I remember being delirious in the airport not yet tapped into the reality of the situation. Getting on extremely long haul flights can have a strange psychological impact on me. Seeing the massive tail of the jet that would take us so far away brought back a sense of adventure that slices right through a natural comfort zone and opens up a new world of opportunity and possibility thinking. A change of scenery was a privilege I was beginning to welcome with great pleasure...I'd been all over the world in my life. I had always been excited to find the party at my destination. I was becoming a connoisseur of clubbing and nightlife in many major cities all over the world. I'd witnessed the locals revel in Munich muscle men in platform boots at the Redlight in Paris the deafening electronic music poolside in Miami and the London underground. I was always looking for that party in New York. I never really found it. I had scavenged the city for "the place to be" but I'd been chasing insanity all along. It wasn't a specific place in the city I was looking for but an experience and a state of being that I would never really find...I had been on many long haul flights before but none like this. This I knew was a life-changing journey. We circled the globe as the flight turned an enormous page in my life. The party was over. Little did I know I'd eventually find much more authentic ways of having fun..There was seven hours left of flight time and I was wide-awake so I checked out the in-flight radio. I opened myself up to new music with the desire of creating new memories. I needed a theme song to this new chapter of my life. It was like taking off was the end of the season finally episode and landing would be the beginning of next season's premiere. It was time and I'd definitely suffered enough to know that it was time to make some serious changes in my life...A few hours later we were descending over Hong Kong and on our way into the airport to connect to our flight to Phuket Thailand. I know my mom had a glass of wine with the in-flight dinner but that was all she had since leaving the house the day before (after drinking all day). She slept the whole flight deeply which wasn't normal for someone who isn't usually a heavy sleeper. For me alcohol made me a very light sleeper. My brain was agitated as after only a couple of hours into my sleep the absence of alcohol causes receptors in the brain to awaken and become more active. I felt this was the norm for my mother but not on that flight. I wondered about that...We went for breakfast as the sun rose over Hong Kong international airport I was dehydrated and in desperate need of water. I had my appetite back so I figured I'd eat as much as I could possibly eat. .. I'll have a Quroyal.  My mom asked the waiter. Being an immense international airport in which people on all different time zones were passing through the waiter didn't seem phased. However it was 6:30 am and I don't recall ever seeing my mom order a Quroyal in my life.  It's just light.  She said... I don't care.  I said shaking my head. I just found it pathetic that she had to order a mix of brandy and champagne and call it  light  instead of just ordering her drink of choice to hide from me   or what she though was my ignorance to the ingredients of a drink with hard liquor   that it wasn't exactly a 7 am drink. Three Quroyals later and we were on our way to the gate to board our next short flight to paradise. ..As we exited the plane in Thailand a wave of unexpected heat and humidity hit me in mid-January. I was already sweating and my body was telling me to get rid of any unnecessary clothes. We got in a rental car and proceeded to drive what we though would be the short hour and a half drive to Koh Lanta a remote island south of the major tourist destination of Phuket. It's funny to me that Thailand is a tourism driven country full of tourists who want to get away from the  touristy  destinations...Three hours later we were lost the time was ticking to the last ferry and my mom was craving a beer badly. I was beginning to be able to tell in my new sobriety when other alcoholics were starting to really itching for that drink. From the twitch in their eye to falsely admitting they are hungry and needing to  do lunch  to the eventual surrender of admitting the last thing they want to admit    I need a beer   ..I was onto it. She knew it and was beginning to resent me for it. I knew I couldn't drink and at this point had no desire to but I could see the desperation in her eyes and it made me feel bad for her...Three more hours later we had barely made it to the ferry in time to get to the island. There was a line of shops and restaurants along the road towards the ferry station where stalled cars would buy snacks and things while they waited. .. Justin would you go for a walk down there and get your mother a beer?  she asked. .. What? You can go get your own beer. After what I just went through I'm not touching a beer. .. Oh! Really  You can't touch a beer. You don't even drink beer!  She got out of the car and ventured off down the street looking for a place to buy a few beers to drink while on the ferry in the drivers seat. Anything goes in Thailand. She eventually came back empty handed and annoyed at generally everything...Once we boarded the small ferry I got out of the car and looked around. The sun was low in the afternoon sky. Off the coast of the mainland there were mountainous tropical islands and longtail fishing boats. My carsick delirious pale face felt out of place surrounded by the natural beauty of paradise. I was psychologically taking it all in my change of scenery where i'd just been in the last 48 hours and how this new try at sobriety would succeed in the jungle of lawlessness. Liquor was available 24/7 in Thailand. I climbed up onto a walking platform above the cars and felt dizzy as the loud rusty engine of the boat took us across the small sound. Then the strangest thing happened. Within the sound of the rattling engine I could hear my father screaming at me the same words over and over again. I could swear it was his voice yelling as the engine's propeller got louder and softer with the waves. He was screaming something at me angrily but it was hard to make out. I was afraid I was seriously going crazy. I tried to distract myself from the voice but it kept coming. I eventually put on headphones and listened to music and the voice went away when the engine stopped. It was like my brain was fabricating voices intertwined within loud obnoxious noises it was processing. ..I kept my mind busy to silence my mind but I was still afraid of a bed where I'd be eventually forced to lay my head down and close my eyes and experience whatever kind of crazy I'd sense alone in the silent darkness with nothing to drown out the voices...We finally arrived at the house after dark and we immediately went out to a restaurant.  Chang Yai!  She ordered which was a kind of beer a large beer. I ordered tonic water and food and was ready to pass out. Three or four beers later and with a much more relaxed mother we went back to the house for the night. I was starting to see double and feel dizzy which I attributed to the mixture of alcohol withdrawal sleep deprivation and jet-lag - what a combination right?..I was still slightly afraid of sleeping because of the potential sleep paralysis that might hit. I hoped I had been sober long enough that it wouldn't happen. Reluctantly my head hit the pillow I left the Air conditioning on and I fell into a deep sleep...**NEXT PART:** http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/19m43i/four_ounces_of_courage_part_7_authenticity/
