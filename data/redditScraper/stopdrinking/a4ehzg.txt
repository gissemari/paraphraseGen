This is what my brain is trying to convince my heart of right now. It is trying to tell me that I will be fine if I just have a couple and don't leave the house to do anything stupid. No one will even have to know I had a couple it's worked in the past got drunk and no one knew and no consequences. Why not tonight?!  Gah!!!  This internal struggle is so very exhausting. ..Instead of drinking I am going to run a couple quick errands (without getting cash or going to the liquor store) maybe get myself a shake come home and go to an online meeting then snuggle in for some bad TV. I really wish that bitch in my brain would shut up!!

It will get more quiet. Its crazy how powerful the addiction is. Good thing you made up plans for today tell the voice in your brain to shut it and keep doing what youre doing. I will not drink with you today! 
I went for an evening walk. It worked
