Hey there r/stopdrinking. I'm at my wits end. This post is long so I'll post a TL;DR at the bottom...My mother has been an alcoholic for years now. She admits to being a functioning alcoholic but refuses treatment. She's also emotionally abusive psychologically unstable and borderline psychotic at times. She can also be a wonderfully sweet human being which is even more turbulent mentally and emotionally. Despite having said all that I'm not here to talk about her. ..My older brother is also an alcoholic. He is 33 years old and currently lives with her. He has failed out of/dropped out of 3 or 4 Universities now to the point to where my father has simply cut him off financially. My mother refuses to do that to him. His self-esteem is in the tank which only fuels his alcoholism more. Living with my mom is detrimental to ANYONE's mental health (my wife had to go on anti-anxiety medication and antidepressants when we lived with her) but it's exceptionally so for him. ..He has mentioned getting treatment and reached out to the family doctor that he has a problem and needs help. They prescribed him some medication to deal with the withdrawal symptoms and he did well for a total of six days before he relapsed...My mom who claims she wants him to get better (or at least functioning like her) refuses to quit drinking. She admits she has a problem but will not quit even though she knows my brother needs her to in order to fight this demon. She keeps handles of vodka in the house and hides them (he always finds them) but refuses to give it up outright. She claims that her withdrawals because she's been an alcoholic longer than my brother would be worse and she'd miss too much work. She keeps saying that if she tried to give it up too they'd both be out of work and since she pays for everything they'd both be worse off...I don't drink much myself. I've tried to reach out to my brother and offer him help. I offered to go to AA with him so he wouldn't feel alone. I've told him to call me if he needs anything. I try to get together to do things to distract him. Every time I'm around he refuses to talk about it. I think he feels like he has to be the "big brother" and protect me from his demons...I just want to help him. My mother might be too far gone to help but I don't want my brother to be dragged into that life. I don't know what to do anymore. Help?..**TL;DR Alcoholic brother is living with alcoholic mom. Brother wants help and is trying but mom refuses and it causes brother to relapse. OP needs help.**
