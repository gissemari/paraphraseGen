Quit drinking right after Thanksgiving and then slipped and had a whole bottle of wine a few days before New Years. Felt like shit as I spiraled out of control over the course of the night. Next morning hungover strapped on my sober-boots and made it to the middle of March when I had 1-3 beers a night for 5 nights while on a trip. Yet I knew I couldn't continue to moderate. Got back home and didn't drink so as not to get comfortable and re-form my sit my on couch and drink all night habit again. ..Then last night I had a whole bottle of wine again since Bosch was back on Amazon and work is done and I'm heading out tomorrow to California for a family trip to Disneyland and LEGOland while staying on the beach. Another shitshow ensued last night with hot flashes and the spins. 6 months ago a bottle of wine would have been nothing but either due to the loss in tolerance or the 45 pounds I've lost in weight from eating healthier and no wine calories I'm a drinking lightweight now. This morning wasn't fun: bad taste in mouth sick stomach destroyed the toilet bowl a few times but I'm glad I feel like this since it makes re-committing to soberness easier...Now I think I can have fun on my vacation with my wife and son without thinking a drink in my hand is needed to enjoy the trip or a sunset on the beach. So I guess I'm saying to any readers is keep on being sober drinking really isn't fun. I'm a sadist and my wine relapses were quick leaps into my past behaviors and I suffered hard and I get scared straight. This is also my warning to those who think they can moderate: easing in is just going to build back your tolerance and you're just going to slip back slowly into old habits at the same levels or more of alcohol that you were drinking previously. In that sense the idea of trying to moderate at least for me is more dangerous.

I hear you! For some reason I felt like I had to hit rock bottom again before jumping back on the wagon! Stay strong!
Are you talking Harry Bosch?  I've read all of Michael Connelly's books except maybe the last one.  He's my favorite.  I didn't know that there was a show on Amazon. Was it as good as the books?  I'll have to check it out.  I had the same thing happen to me after not drinking wine for 3 months I had a bottle and got pretty wasted whereas before I could drink a bottle of wine over 5 hours and not really get trashed.  I also had lost 23 pounds from 155 lbs down to 132 lbs.  So yes being smaller and not drinking leads to no tolerance.  Since that last fall I've had a few badge resets myself.  I agree it was totally not worth it.  Plus the downer of wasting money on wine.  Have fun at the beach.  IWNDWYT
