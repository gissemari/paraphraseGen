My roommate is going to a brewery w a co worker of hers that I would like to get to know. It was really hard to say I wasn't going to go. I figured if I went I would probably make an ass hat out of myself anyways and her co worker would end up hating me. First sober weekend in years!

Try it next weekend or another one when you will feel fine and ready for it. There is no need to rush that. Who knows maybe you will go not to a pub but to a have a dinner with the college and the roommate and just have coke or water and amazing dinner!
Good for you you made the right choice. I just logged in to this sub because I was about to go out and justify  one  drink. We all know what that means. Just know you're not alone and I will not drink with you today.
