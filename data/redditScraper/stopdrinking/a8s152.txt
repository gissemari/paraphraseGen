Today makes 6 months for me without alcohol. It's been the hardest day aside from days 1 and 2. I still miss being able to go out with friends and have a few drinks but who I became while drinking is not who I want to be. I hurt those who I loved the most made decisions I can never take back and still to this day carry those burdens...I normally only lurk the subs but today is different. ..For anyone out there struggling with life's burdens stay strong.

Nice work on 6 months! Keep posting!
Awesome job!  I miss hanging out with friends having some drinks too but also know I can't moderate. I may need to find sober friends. I feel so boring now. Anyway it's nice not to have hangovers!!! IWNDWYT 
That is amazing. Congratulations!..Let's keep on moving forward! IWNDWYT :)..&amp;#x200B;
Great work!  Hang in there!
Congratulations   
Well done. Congrats 
 Nice work. IWNDWYT   
Well done! It took me a couple decades and then some to realize I do not like who I am when drinking. I am learning to really like sober me and so does my family especially my wife and son...I will not drink with you today
Tough time of year for most of us. Stay strong.
Great work. You're not alone with those burdens.
So proud of you! 
Congrats stay strong! 
Congratulations    ! Well Done!!! Stay  !!! IWNDWYT
