I'm 27 and I was 6 years old when the first one came out but i saw it when i was 17 at the very begining of what it will become my addiction. At 21 when I was really hook on cocaine and alcohol I always watched trainspotting alone in my room to feel normal. I watch it again and again untill i fall sleep if i slept at all. Watching Renton and the gang doing somewhat the same stuff in a movie made me feel th at I was not that bad. I was just glamorazing it but i felt so right everythin just was ok. ..Now trying so hard to be sober relape and relapse on this past 7 months I finally feel confortable being who I am. I think i finally feel good with being sober. I just don't know why but I jusy hit me. Whatever may come it always better being sober. No spoilers but the final scene really hits home. I feel so confortable right now. I really know now that I can make this work...I will not drink with you today. CHOOSE LIFE.

You can do it!  I haven't seen the second one yet but I loved the original when it came out because it made addiction seem so absurd and lighthearted.  The reality has not been so lighthearted for me.  Glad you're here!

Choose life!
I've never seen either of these so I can't comment.  I will be sober with you today!
