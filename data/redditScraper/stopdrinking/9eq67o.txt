I'm two weeks sober as of tomorrow...&amp;#x200B;..I've made it through:..* House Parties.* Cookouts.* Wife Drinking.* Patriots Game.* Family Vacation.* Stresses from work and side gig..Each of the above are major triggers for me and I made it through each yet somehow when I hop on here to respond to others I still ask myself "\*Who and I to give advice?\*"...&amp;#x200B;..It was then that I realized others may be thinking the same and it's for those lurkers that I am writing this...&amp;#x200B;..I made it through the above challenges because I had the stories to read on here which distracted me from my cravings...&amp;#x200B;..I made it because I had a game plan moving into this chapter of my life (Seltzers for the win)..&amp;#x200B;..I made it because I knew I had everyone who followed my work watching me some waiting for me to screw up...&amp;#x200B;..Most importantly I made it because people took the time to share their successes and failures on this subreddit something which wouldn't happen if we all kept the wall of "*who am I to give advice*" up...&amp;#x200B;..I know this subreddit has likely seen thousands of people make it to two weeks only to relapse before three or right after one month I get it...&amp;#x200B;..Still for those who've made it 1 year 1 month 1 week or even 1 day you did that and your voice is just as needed as anyone elses...&amp;#x200B;..I'm going to make an effort to write and share more inside here because I feel not only will it benefit others who lurked the way I did initially but also it'll help me keep myself accountable as well...&amp;#x200B;..So I hold my La Croix in the air to you all cheers to another day of not letting alcohol control who we are...&amp;#x200B;..Hunter

Very nice. I have felt the same. And I lurked before I committed as well. So to all you lurkers grab a sparkling water of your choice turn the page and join the party. Share your shit and your triumphs. It is the best thing for my sobriety outside of my personal self examination. The coolest part? You are not the only one going through it. ..Thanks for your awesome post Hunter and for using this sub to keep yourself accountable. And congrats on closing in on two weeks!..I will raise my glass of Dasani sparkling to all of us choosing to be sober today. Cheers!..*(wow. this really helps motivate me to sobriety)*
All the "making it through [x triggering event]" posted here are super helpful to me too. I've now made it through at least 200 of what would have in my past seemed very good excuses to drink. But specifically my boyfriend's birthday "patio season" at bars happening a regional work event finding out I did not get promoted finding out I did get promoted after all lots of job stress a national very boozy work convention a visit to my very triggering parents my birthday and now moving. Through all of these things I remembered someone else's post about getting through something similar. I try to post on these things myself if I can. Even though my posts seldom get much attention I love it if I can play it forward to even 1 of my sobernaut friends here. IWNDWYT.
Love this post thanks for sharing this we all have something to learn no matter how many days or years we have under our belt. I find myself frequently gaining wisdom and insight from people with 1 day and 5 years here. Keep it up friend sobriety is so very much worth it.
