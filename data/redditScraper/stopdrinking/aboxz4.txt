Today it needs to stop. That's the decision I made weeks ago...And I'm struggling. Telling myself "what's one more night?"..I know the tricks my addiction is playing on me right now and some tricks to combat them I had a year at one point years ago...But there is just so much TIME in the evening when you aren't working towards passing out drunk. I forgot about that.

It helps a lot to go to bed early in the early days ... like *really* early. 
It's the first day of the year!  You won't have to worry about your day count!..There's always somethin' to do.  I just watched 2 hours of cooking shows and I don't even cook. ..iwndwyt
I will not drink with you today 
I don't think this is trivial. He is violating your personal space and ignoring your repeated attempts to tell him NO. I hope you can find some way to get him to understand that no means no. 
IWNDWYT.   Please choose today to really stop.  I have been visiting my brother-in-law in the hospital since Xmas Eve and he is still in the ICU.  You don't want to that to your family nor you.
