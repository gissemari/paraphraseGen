Hello r/stopdrinking - I love you people. I've lurked here for a couple of years and am now happily sober for longer than I've been in my adult life. I've said "I'm done with alcohol.." many many times but after losing another friend to alcoholism this past August I tried again. Thanks to this sub Annie Grace's "This Naked Mind" the plethora of 12-step programs on intherooms.org occasional AA meetings phone calls with friends in recovery meditation exercise eating healthy and self-honesty I've found sobriety to be a wonderful gift and a pleasurable experience. ..Visiting this sub again and again has taught me that relapse is part of recovery and to be gentle with myself as I try to learn a new way of living. There is so much help here if you click read and keep coming back. ..Lilly Tomlin has a quote that has helped me along during this early-sobriety that "Forgiveness is giving up all hope for a better past." Learning to forgive my failures in staying sober in the past has freed me to live in gratitude for the present. I'm so grateful that I haven't been hungover worried about something stupid I said or did or any of the other typical troubles binge drinkers get into. ..If you're just starting out just keep doing it. Anxieties (over whatever/everything) get better and you see them for what they really are: just thoughts...not truths. The confidence and happiness and relaxation that I thought I gained through Jameson is already there without it. IWNDWYT.

I really like that quote. Forgiveness is something I'm working on. Congrats on five months!!!
Congrats on 5 months!..The forgiveness quote is fantastic. I'm definitely going to need to reread that often I think as I parent my kids *through* their teens. Forgiveness for me for making mistakes and forgiveness for them because it's hard as a teen not to say hurtful things when you're hurt/angry.
