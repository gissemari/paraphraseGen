I don't know why today has been so hard. I had a pretty good day at work my life is so much less stressful than it was 27 days ago and I'm working a good program (in week four of a night program going to meetings etc.)..Yet the drinking thoughts are loud today. The loudest one seems to be "There's no way you're going to actually stay sober. You're going to relapse eventually." Whether or not this is true is irrelevant - I have to bring myself back to JUST TODAY. All I have to do is stay sober today. I feel confident that I can do it but I wish the drinking thoughts would f*** off. I hate that I'm doing everything right and yet am still thinking hard about drinking...This is the hardest day I've had in sobriety and I'm gonna get through it sober.

Please don't give up what you want the most for something you want now.  ..Stay strong!
It can be done even if you have to go hour by hour which is what it came down to for me. Those first 30 days were very difficult...I wanted to jump out of my skin at times! Went to a lot of meetings even if I had to force myself to go. It will get better.
My brain is saying "You don't really have a problem.  Maybe you just need to cut back instead of being so dramatic and acting like you can't handle your alcohol.  You're going to drink again in a few weeks and then you're going to be sorry you skipped out on all those summer happy hours and poured out all that liquor at home."  I'm just trying to soldier on.  I don't feel like I can win an argument with my own mind.  I got a 24 hour coin at AA -- it says To Thine Own Self Be True.  I like that.  I'm going to work on being true to myself and try to stop second guessing this decision to stop drinking.
