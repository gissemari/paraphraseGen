Hey all.  I've posted here before during previous attempts to quit most notably after I was hospitalized for withdrawal.  I managed to get two weeks sober with the help of a valium taper before relapsing again...This new years eve I got a dui.  My car is impounded for thirty days and my license is suspended for ninety.  I commute to work and I don't make very much money.  This is going to be incredibly costly for me.  I may have to start selling off some of my precious record collection :(..I've never felt so much shame before.  I was drunk enough to be a danger to sober drivers on the road and the worst part?  I was driving to get more beer...Today is day 2.  I didn't have any panic attacks or shaking yesterday so the withdrawals aren't going to be serious this time.  There will be some sweaty nights and insomnia which I can deal with...Wish me luck.  This is an incredibly hard battle for me.
