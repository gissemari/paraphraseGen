I have always gone to extremes with obtaining alcohol and this was one of them. My parents have a locked up refrigerator where they keep their alcohol (this has worked pretty well) but today I was home alone and found a way to break into that fridge and get some of the alcohol. I didnt want to but somehow the craving was a lot stronger than normal. And I had the equivalent of a glass of wine and a few shots. (Because I knew she would notice if I took more). This actually the third day that Ive been craving but I completely gave in and found a way to get to the alcohol..I know that I cannot drink the alcohol in the fridge anymore because it will become noticeable but  in the mean time can anyone give me suggestions for curbing the cravings?? Ive tried tea but need other suggestions!.
