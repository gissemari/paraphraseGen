Hello. Obviously this is a throwaway. But for your basic info I'm a female in my mid-twenties...Anyways as the title says I want to stop drinking for a few reasons. Mostly health based. I just don't really know how or how to tell other people in my life that I really need to stop. I imagine y'all know a bit about that. ..Bit of background with my drinking history:.Really started when I was 19 typical college stuff but nothing insane. Would party a couple times a week with my friends blacked out here and there but again nothing out of the ordinary. ..As I started getting older I noticed I couldn't process alcohol quite as well and hangovers got worse which I assumed was pretty normal. However over the past couple years or so I REALLY haven't been able to process booze like people my age. Now with one drink my stomach does somersaults. I'll get into more detail in a bit...Main reasons I want to stop drinking:..1) My health. Since I graduated high school I've been trying to get a diagnosis on a myriad of symptoms I have: fatigue brain fog and GI issues like gas/bloating and heartburn. So far we've figured out that I have pernicious anemia meaning that I can't absorb B12 properly through food. I've also been tested for celiac which came back negative and we've ruled out IBS too. No one's been able to nail it down exactly but right now I'm thinking it's gastritis caused by the anemia. ..What this all comes down to is I can't have one drink without wanting to vomit. If I can stomach it then later I'm absolutely miserable. Stomach pain restlessness ect. A couple of weekends ago I managed to put down enough drinks to get 19-year-old-me absolutely shit-faced. Even after emptying my stomach several times over I was completely useless for about three days. It felt worse than food poisoning...2) Alcoholism runs in my family. My dad has struggled with it on and off for years (though he's always hid it very well seeing as I had no idea until a few years ago). Recently his brother passed away due to alcoholism-related complications which sent my dad back on some binges recently. I am afraid that if I'm somehow able to continue to drink despite my health issues that I'm predisposed to abuse it. And if that aforementioned weekend is any indication if I can get past that first wave of nausea I. Do. Not. Stop...3) It's not fun anymore. There was a time when I first started drinking that it was great I got less nervous all my friends were doing it ect. Duh. Now because of everything I mentioned above there really is no benefit. Where a couple drinks used to give me a good happy buzz they now make me nauseous and drowsy. And beyond a few drinks I feel like I've basically been poisoned. Because of this the taste of most alcohol just puts me off completely. And then I start thinking about how this stupid drug has so negatively affected my family and it really does not seem worth it...**TL;DR** **I have GI issues alcoholism runs in my family I don't like it anymore anyway.**..So onto the second part of this post. How do I go about telling people that I don't want to drink anymore? As I said the fact that the taste alone is to make me nauseous and just how miserable I feel after is enough to stop me. But most of my friends and family are pretty avid social drinkers (Dad not included and he and my mom are divorced by the way). Being the age that we are it's pretty much what our friend group does when they get together. I'm visiting with my family this week and they love beer and wine tasting. My SO manages a bar for god's sake. It's everywhere...That all being said everyone I actually care about/am close to are extremely kind and understanding. My SO knows pretty much all the details I've listed here and he's committed to help me in anyway he can. But it's a bit overwhelming to think about when managing the rest of my life and the people in it. I just don't know where to start. What do I do when our friends just want to go to a bar for instance? Or my parents want to go wine tasting? My SO and I are getting married very soon I don't want to deprive people of an awesome party (and I honestly have no issue with other people drinking as long as they're being safe/smart) but how do I also not draw attention to the fact the bride is going to be stone-cold-sober?..I know in the big scheme people will be supportive and understanding it's just a lot to think about right now. I don't know if you have absolutely any advice for me on how to navigate this I'm open to it. And if you've read this whole wall of text thank you so much for listening to me. I really do appreciate it..

I was able to stop drinking and get sober by doing the things [at the Baby Steps post at this link.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Good luck to you I hope some of the ideas there are helpful to you.
For me there is no inbetween. I either choose to be a drinker or a non-drinker. And everything falls into place. I know I can't live in both worlds. I know I can't please everyone. I let everyone else do whatever they want and just work with it. 
For the most part I haven't told people I'm not drinking. When offered a drink I reply "No. Thank you but love a glass of ..." When pressed I offer reasons such as ..- I have an early morning .- I've got a long run tomorrow and *any* alcohol messes me up.- I'm just not feeling it tonight .- it's not in the calorie budget; I'd rather have ice cream..If you search the sub you'll find a number of other great lines. I've found the vast majority of time a simple "no thanks" is sufficient because most people are not paying as much attention to our drinking as we think..
Hiya! All those are perfectly valid reasons to not drink anymore.  As for telling people most people don't really care over much why you're not drinking. They'll ask when you're out to dinner or something and they all order wine and you order a soda water or something but that's only because (lol *only*.) booze is so ingrained into our society that not drinking seems weird. They'll ask if you're pregnant because being pregnant is way more likely in their view than simply not wanting alcohol on a given day. It's irritating. But that's largely the extent of it. Your reasoning is more than enough of an excuse for most. "I would but it aggravates some GI issues I have" boom. Done. If they persist (and the heavy drinkers do because for them not drinking is literally unfathomable) then I'd go into deliciously graphic deeper detail "yeah no I wish I could but I'm telling you it's liquid shit for hours the next day. Liquid. Shit " ;)   
Hey! Your story sounds a lot like mine from the college partying to the alcoholic family history to the health issues to the supportive SO. I'm also a woman in my mid-20s with a lot of friends who drink. Like you I've gotten to the point where I know what's at the bottom of the bottle: a hangover regrets and incredible amounts of anxiety. Right now I'm more interested in what's to be found *outside* the bottle. ..For me as it relates to social situations it comes down to this: I don't want to drink right now so I'm not. That's my decision and mine alone. If other people choose to drink cool! Great! Not my decision not my problem. I just order a club soda/Diet Coke/whatever and be done with it. Once I order that first non-alcoholic drink I find the pressure is off. My friends are a supportive bunch too and for the most part its been taken in stride. And for what it's worth I think you'll find many people are so wrapped up in what they're drinking they won't notice what you're drinking. :)..As it relates to feeling overwhelmed my best advice is: One. Day. At a time. It sounds like you have a pretty awesome support system in place I would take advantage of that and express your feelings as much as you want/need to. Post here as much as you like. Journal if that helps you gather your thoughts. Therapy has also been really helpful for me personally. ..Sorry for the rambling I'll stop now! I just really relate to your story. Good luck and all the best to you!
