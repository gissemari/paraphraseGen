I get pretty emotional when drinking and while the emotions are generally positive/inspired it certainly doesn't translate to productivity.  ..When I stop drinking I struggle with a couple things.  1) I can't seem to find that excitement to create something and 2) when I do excited about an idea I can't seem to focus the energy and it's starts to make me VERY anxious...I guess what I'm saying is I've been using booze to temper these two things for a long time and I hoping some of you might share you're experience in how to manage it without the bottle...Thanks

It just takes time. 
Personally I never could complete anything creative while drinking.  I'd look at what I'd written and very little of it was useful...Sober I can better construct outlines / structure for a written piece...If you started a project and you feel that you don't need to quit for good could you moderate by seldom drinking and for the purpose of reviewing your work and seeing if you are further inspired?  Just a thought - maybe a bad one and definitely a bad one if you think you are an alcoholic...I will not drink with you today.
I can relate to this post a lot...Without booze I'm re-learning how to create without the crutch. The irony for me is that the booze was not an impediment to my creativity; the work was quite focused even in the cold light of day. And the further irony was that I used booze as a stimulant which worked...So now I'm taking my time more. Things appear to come as easily but that's ok. All in good time.
