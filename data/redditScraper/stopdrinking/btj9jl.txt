How do you all deal with the inevitable loss of friends? I understand real friends will support you etc... But I'm from the UK and we drink so I have 3 or 4 close friends (25+ years) that I know I just wont be able to see anymore. Im ready to be ruthless and do whatever it takes this time but is anyone else struggling with this?

You'll be surprised at how many stick around :)
You're right some of them will disappear. Some of them will surprise you with how supportive they are. What I have found is that I'm surprising and inspiring some of my friends with my change in lifestyle and habits....to the point where they change too. I never know how my friends will react but being honest with everyone about what I'm doing and where I'm at makes me feel confident in my decisions. IWNDWYT
I noticed that everone drinks less now just naturally...
I haven't lost any friends that didn't need "losing" a long time ago.  And the longer we stay sober some of them come back sober as well.  I don't use the term never preferring "for now" or "at the moment" because time has taught me that everything is subject to change and everything is right on schedule.
