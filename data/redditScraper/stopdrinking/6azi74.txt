It's been a challenging week.  Lots of feelings.  Mostly insecurity frustration and anger.  It culminated today with me waking up to a gaping hole in my bathroom ceiling and water pouring everywhere.  This is the result of a larger issue I alerted maintenance to over six weeks ago and now I'm struggling to keep as quiet as possible so words like 'incompetent' and 'fucktard' don't inadvertently slip out.  I have to stay home today and take care of this and I had actually finally made plans with other people in order to stem the feelings of isolation I'd been having that I now have to cancel...On top of that I got some unpleasant family news yesterday.  A beloved uncle is facing some really difficult times and there is very little I am able to do to help...I'm feeling the heady mixture of loneliness impotence and rage that I used to assuage with alcohol and other substances.  Now with sobriety my single highest priority I just have to sit and feel this shit.  It's unpleasant.  It's uncomfortable.  I do not like it...I'm going to take a nap and clean up the mess this dumbass made when I wake up.  But I will not drink today with you good people.

Good on you for being aware of what's actually behind this. Excellent self awareness my friend. Props on coming here to vent!..Drinking would only make a shitty situation shittier...I will gladly join you in not drinking today.
Impotence = powerless. Boy do I feel powerless sometimes. I feel bright and capable and I think those qualities should mean that I'm able to control what happens to me how people react to me etc. Sometimes circumstances are truly beyond my control. ..I tore up my car this week when I hit a deep pot hole in the highway. After spending $450 and two days without a vehicle the car is running better than ever and I'm no longer confined to a walkable radius of my house. That was an unwelcome interruption to the week that I had planned. But if I had done the same thing a year ago I probably would have driven a car with a busted exhaust system for weeks or months until somebody else told me I had a problem. Now I dealt with it as soon as it happened. Life still has plenty of crappy surprises but I do think that I handle them better now. ..And I did feel like drinking when I found out how bad the damage was but I called my sponsor and another friend from AA and I no longer felt like I needed that drink. Glad you're sharing with us here.
