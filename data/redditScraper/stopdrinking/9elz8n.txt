day nine and feeling fine... and other such rhyming statements. ..feeling good though in all seriousness. having a busy and productive morning at work got a few important creative deadlines to hit this evening pretty much don't have time to drink anyway... or that's what I keep telling myself. ..this morning I realised I needed to renew my season ticket (train commute) before work so just... left early. no muss no fuss. it's still weird to not be wading through treacle in the mornings for 'leaving early' to not take the night before of psyching myself up and setting multiple early alarms so my eyes are open by the time I leave the house after struggling through the shower I couldn't take the night before because I was wasted. little things like having lunch and the coffee pot ready in advance are worth skipping the booze. ..thoughts of drinking are still popping up but weekdays are easier. hope you all have a marvellous Monday - I will not drink with you today!
