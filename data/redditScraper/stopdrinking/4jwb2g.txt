Well this is my first professional go at stopping my addiction to beer. I had done it many times alone and in moderation. This time it is different. I read the stories was up after 10pm sober and reading the shitty stories and how people are struggling worse than me. I read the success stories too that gave me some insight to where I could go. I am going to do it again today. My wife and I are talking shes gone to a different city to get her head straight with her struggles. I feel good slept good..I'm ready. Good morning all.
