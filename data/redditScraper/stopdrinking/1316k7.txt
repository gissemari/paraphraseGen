2 weeks is usually the point where I fail miserably but am determined to make it past it this time. It's simply not an option to ever pick up a drink again. It's just not. Cravings have quadrupled though in the last couple of days so still going to a meeting every day to help cope and actually picking up that 500 lb phone now...I'm struggling to be honest with people but finding that everyone is so so supportive. I wish that I had asked for help years ago. It's still hard though to tell friends down south that you might not be able to come back because jail or at least probation is a pretty viable option in the next couple week. They're shocked and surprised but supportive. I think people are less judgmental than you think once you're sober...Anxious but still happier today than my best day drinking.

Awesome way to go. It's hard to be honest sometimes no matter where we're at. And it's taken me a while to get there but I really do believe people genuinely want to see everyone else get and stay sober - you're probably helping them as much as they're helping you. Keep up the good work! It'll get easier.
Please don't take this as a slight. It only gets harder. Not because of cravings but because of situations that happen to you. Some on here will under stand most won't. Just keep mindful
Hell yes! Keep reaching to your support system keep doing what you are doing.
I'm right there at 2 weeks with you. Surprisingly carrying some chocolate candies in my pocket to munch on has helped curb some of the cravings.
Good job.  People are pretty supportive but just being honest with people you are close to that you've got a problem and need help or are working on it is what really sealed the deal for me...so many years wasted trying to do it on my own worked in spurts but never felt like actual change.
