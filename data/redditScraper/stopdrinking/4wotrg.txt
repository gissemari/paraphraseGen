Sort of I got literally 0 hours sleep last night. Off to work some cash in hand construction. It feels good being technically not unemployed. Also it will be good to have some form of contact with the outside world lol. With my alcoholism and depression I've been in full hermit mode for a long time. Many of the friends I made in life I dont keep in contact with and hence completely lost touch. I would constantly blow off plans to meet them because I wanted to get high or drunk on my own or with my other 'friends' in the pub i.e. other alcoholics. This is a regret I never really thought of until now. I was always thinking damn all my mates are either druggies or alkies. Well obviously. Its because they were the only people I actually made time for because there was drugs and alcohol. I hope with a healthier me I can meet some healthier people and have healthier friendships. So many regrets but I need to accept them and move forward which is a struggle I've always had. Dwelling in the past will only make me more miserable and there only a mistake if I don't learn from them. Sorry for rant this is really therapeutic to me as I don't really have anywhere else to get things of my chest

Hi! Congrats on 4 days! Sleep is tough the first few days..but I'm really happy to hear that you're going to do some construction work - it will keep you busy and productive maybe ease some of the depression and get you out of the hermit mode too. ..The only 'friends' I had were from the bars and they only used me for rides money and free drinks. I haven't seen them or been to those places in more than 6 months and I couldn't be happier. It was outright toxic and did nothing but hinder my opportunity for sobriety. You will be getting much healthier; with the improved health the other improvements come along - maybe new friends new hobbies new joys. Really whatever you want!! ..So keep posting and venting we're here for you and we understand. We've been there. Looking forward to hearing how the work went :).
SO GLAD TO HEAR FROM YOU!  Great job getting off the couch and into the world.  Some great self-realization going on in your post.  Look how amazing you are!!  Not drinking with YOU today!
