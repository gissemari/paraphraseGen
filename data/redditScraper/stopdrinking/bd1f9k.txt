Hi there first time here...Ive known that  I have an issue with my drinking for a while but did not want to face it...I can't stop at one or two I always have to drink to excess then drugs are involved and it's been going on for a few years now. ..I can go days without drinking but then when I do drink it's obscene I black out and lose hours...When I do get drunk I've started getting into really depressive and angry moods...The tipping point for me to change myself was finding a suicide note to my boyfriend on my phone notes from one month ago..I can't remember this at all and now realise it's no longer safe for me to continue the way I have been...I need to advice on staying sober especially as I work in Hospitality and bars so it can be a real struggle as the temptations are always there...Sorry for rambling thanks for reading...Much Love x

My advice is don't drink...Lol though seriously I dunno.  Try to find things you enjoy.  I started cooking a bunch.  I purposely don't stock up on stuff that expires so I go to the grocery store often so it's fresh and just so I have something to do.  I started playing video games again which I really didn't do much when I drank oddly.  AA meetings were something to do which I did for early months.  Don't feel guilty if you want to eat a bunch or sleep a while at first it's the lesser of two evils.
I've used and highly recommend the nomo app. It tracks milestones and the other savings you make (money time calories etc). Just don't lose focus on why you want to stop. It's hard beating yourself up but think of the  drinking you' as a guest you invite into your life. If this person was someone else would you invite them? Or even encourage them to drink at all if they were your friend and you saw how miserable they became? ..In all honestly if a sober life was easy or perfect no one would have a problem. But the reality is it can be a challenge but it's surely preferable to letting what is essentially a drug control you your actions and your happiness. Good luck x
