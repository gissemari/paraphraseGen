Drove six hours to watch the boy play baseball this weekend.  When we pulled into our motel on Friday evening I had a spooky experience.  It was almost like a muscle memory.  Pull into the motel and -- "Boy I'm ready for a drink."  Ummm not so fast Skipper...Backstory -- two summers ago the last year of my relapse I drank my way across the country following his Legion team as they won.  Rituals were established.  Pull into town find the liquor store buy a half-gallon of Bombay Sapphire and some tonic a six-pack of IPA then find the motel.  Check-in and pour a stout one.  ..I have no interest or desire to drink so that reflexive response took me by surprise.  However since my relapse came after 11+ years of being sober I know that I am never out of the woods. Perhaps it won't be the thick scary forest.  Perhaps the light will filter through the trees and the path will be a bit less strenuous.  But it is and will always be a one day at a time one foot in front of the other journey...So Skipper nice try.  But FTZ.  Today's a beautiful day for sober baseball..
