I'm on day two after a relapse. I had a horrible day at work I have people scream at me for things I have no control over trying to talk my way out of a box while each call is recorded gritting my teeth to keep myself civil. All I want to do is unwind wanting to not feel like shit and  hating myself for coming home and not having any hobbies outside of Netflix and video games. I'm struggling not find my way into a bottle...My dad is having a stint put into tomorrow and he is acting manic because he needs to feel preoccupied so he can take his mind of his mortality. The thought of losing my dad scares the crap out of me and I'm a bundle of nerves but he is acting like prick. He threw my shoes at me because I left them outside my room and talk to the dog that I should take him out for the walk and voluntold to make dinner out of chicken breast he defrosted. Little bit of information here: I live in a household of 7 adults and none ever help out. I know I have a lazy streak too but this past week I have helped out on dinner several times and just last night cleaned my room that has been a mess for months. Today is the start to my weekend and I'm mentally exhausted and wanting to stay sober but I feel like my feelings are disregarded because I'm the less dramatic of all the poeple living here. I just heard my dad muttering about "his lazy children". I work 40 hours a weekend at a call center for customer service while there are two people living here who work part time or have no job. One of those people never cleans her cats litter pans leaves it for  my dad to do even though she has 3 cats! I just can't even. But whatever I'm lazy because no one else helps out in basic chores...Please help me here tonight I'm ready to cry and grab a six pack...And yes I live in a house of narcissists.

I have felt this way plenty of times. It seemed like I was unappreciated for the things I contribute. So I just said fuck It! I took myself to lunch. I went to the store and picked up a new perfume. I also wandered around in there far too long. Any way what I'm getting at is sometimes you need to stop and practice self care. I always feel alot better after stepping away. Hope this helps. Hang in there...I will not drink with you today 
Sounds challenging. If it helps my life is a lot better and easier not drinking. It has super much been worth the trouble 100%...Hang in there!
