I am REALLY struggling today. I mean SERIOUSLY struggling. My anxiety is through the roof. I'm so anxious I feel paralyzed. Holding my breath as if in doing so I can hold myself together. My husband and I are signing papers today to start our own business. It's a good thing - so why do I feel so afraid vulnerable freaking petrified????? Aaaahhhhhhh!!!!!
