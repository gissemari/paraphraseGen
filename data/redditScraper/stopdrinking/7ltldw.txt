It's been almost a year of drinking since I started. This is my longest stretch with nothing. Being with family is hugely helpful. Everyone's in bed now but my body is in a different time zone and besides not used to going to bed sober. ..I'm not sure exactly where I'm going with this post but i guess I'm just feeling the weight of my commitment to sobriety. I quit my other crutch weed too and there are a lot of emotions and feelings. Especially during this heartfelt time of year. Seeing old friends and family. ..Anyway I'm trying to post here rather than isolate myself (like I usually do) and express and share my feelings (like I never would before). Alcohol has hurt my health my education my relationships and has never helped in the long run. I need this to work. I need this to stick...I'm feeling a little alone and very scared. I still haven't told anyone I know in real life about this struggle. I'm glad I have you friendly people. Thank you all so much for inspiring me and supporting me. I can't wait for day 4.

     I'm glad I'm not alone too.  I know I wouldn't feel so good about all the changes I'm making now without the support of SD.  Im inspired to do my best.  I like the support I like the friendly welcoming atmosphere and I like a bunch of random strangers celebrating each others success.  Im happy for you tonight.      I'm glad we did not drink today.  
We all understand the struggle. Great job on getting to day three!
