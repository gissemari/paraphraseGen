Thank you. I'm focusing on minute to minute right now. Was hour to hour last night but now a simple minute is a struggle 
Wow such a nice post. Thank you. IWNDWYT 
I am on the secon day of detoxing. The urge to drink is so strong. But IWNDWYT
Thank you. The thoughts have already crept in this morning. Sitting here in my office and opened this sub - this helps. IWNDWYT 
Oh my gosh. I am struggling today. This is my 3rd morning sober in a long time and I have been in constant motion for 4 hours at my office. I was just getting ready to head out and do errands and my mind was telling me that I have had such a great morning that I could stop and have 1 or 2 while I'm out (I own my business and I work from home so no concerns of getting caught which means I have no accountability to anyone other than myself) BUT I know that I want to be sober more than I want to drink so I thought I would do the daily check-in and look at a few posts and I found this! Just what I needed...time to focus on me and my sobriety. And now with that said I am going to grab a sparkling water and head out to do my errands. Thanks for being there for me when I am struggling! IWNDWYT!
