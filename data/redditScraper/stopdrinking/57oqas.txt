Me too!.But I'm not going out I have no alcohol here at home and have no means of getting any brought to me..I think I'm pretty lucky right now because of that it's my saving grace.
Hang in there buddy! I'm having some cravings too so you're not alone.
We're here for you. It sucks to struggle. I keep remembering that this will pass and the most important thing I can do is keep busy and make sure I've attended to all of HALT. So many times I struggled and thought I was alone...and then I went into the IRC and things were looking up almost immediately! Saved my ass so many times :). You're doing fabulous - look at that 74 days!! Wooohooo!! It's going to be OK :). xo
Last night I was craving a drink and I had to attend to the need for rest food and drink before the cravings went away.  And they did!  Hang in there.
My best advice to you :..call someone you can cry / vent to ..do something like read a book play video games watch a movie...if you can't do any of these things bwcause you're miserable...i've been there. ..just go to bed. it'll pass . you'll be happy you went to bed in the AM and you'll feel so much better
Me too.  I just woke up from a nap with the most intense craving ever.  Tried to play it forward and that was a mistake because it looked like a nice pleasant afternoon and evening of boozin' at home like the old days. Tried a different approach and made myself a big cup of coffee.  That helped. Maybe an alternative beverage?  Good luck. 
That sucks but your 74 days are pretty damn great.  Keep on keeping on friend.
I'm dying for a drink now too! I hate my boring sober nites but decided to white-knuckle it to 30 days (day 26 was today) and take it on from there. I have 4 more nights and a wake up.
