I see some of us struggling with weekend drinking risk and some have commented weekday is same risk ...... I agree with both relapse risk is ANY day but height of bingeing was on weekends for me also interesting how a lot of us have so much in common just due to one common factor ... ALCOHOLISM.  It hides and make us loose  a lot of good and special things in each one of us ( me too)

Yes "don't pick up that first drink" applies every day of the week...Thing with weekends is that you may have to work harder and look further to find diversions to help change your routine... ..and yes this leads to my suggestion to find a meeting AA Smart whatever where we can meet other sober folks and maybe pick up a tool or two for how to happily live a sober life...
I think the problem for me in my first month or so was that I had alcohol wrapped up in every aspect of my life. I couldn't see how I could possibly have fun....or unwind....or celebrate...or spend time with friends...or LIVE without alcohol.  [I had to find new things to do without alcohol.]( http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2dggfs/butbeing_sober_is_going_to_be_so_boring_how_am_i/)
Friday--I will not drink TODAY!..Saturday--I will not drink TODAY!..Sunday--I will not drink TODAY!.
In the beginning for me I scheduled my weekends. I did two meetings a day one AM one PM. I saw lots of movies this time last year I went to high school football games. I went to museums there is a lot of really beautiful hiking trails in the mountains I joined 2 meetup.com groups one meets Sunday  the other is every other Saturday if you have kids you are almost home free! Just start scheduling to fill up your time on Monday WHEN you get to work start that schedule and have it filled by COB Friday.
Weekends were hard for me. I filled some of the empty time by going to AA meetings. A safe place where everyone understood gave me encouragement and comfort.
