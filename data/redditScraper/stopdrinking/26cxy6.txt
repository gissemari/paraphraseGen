So I'm currently a bit buzzed so sorry if this post is in bad form but I realize I may have a problem and want people's input on it. ..**Intro/Background**..I find myself grabbing a 6 pack every night and that's cutting down from what I was doing. Sometimes I feel the craving to get more. I don't resort to hard liquor due to some messed up logic that beer is cheaper (it's not but if this is my last 6-pack for the week it is right? Right?) except on the odd occasion...I had an issue with missing work or coming in hungover. I still have the hungover issue but I managed to get over my "I'm still do fucked up to hear the alarm clock" stage. I still think I'm drinking too much for a healthy lifestyle and it's my biggest enemy to getting in shape which is a goal of mine (1200 calories from a 6-pack? Goddamn..) ..**Main Bit**..What I mainly want to know; is drinking in moderation something I should strive for? Or quitting? I ask this because I love cooking. I LOVE cooking. Some recipes call for beer and I have beer left over. Some call for other alcohols. Sometimes a dish is just complemented by alcohol. Should I just stop this shit and stop drinking? Or is moderation a goal I can achieve? I know this is probably highly subjective to my personal ordeal but I wanted to see if others have had success with this...Then how do I stop drinking so much? I'd prefer if I could just drink with friends socially or  not at all but I feel these cravings that are like a angel and devil on my shoulder at 10pm. .."You need to work tomorrow. You need to be up by 7am".."Nah you can sleep in til at least 8am. Sure you'll be hurried and you might get there late but you'll be smashed tonight!".."You've already had a few beers...".."Yeah but your sober enough to get more!" (I've defeated this voice luckily)..Like how do you combat that? I'm kind of at a loss. I feel I'm not in enough of a bad situation to seek a help group or something but I feel I'm still in a bad situation with my relationship to alcohol. Maybe I should but I feel like my struggles might be laughed off as nothing compared to those of 'real' alcoholics. Maybe I'm being over dramatic? I'd like some opinions on this point. I'm very anti-social so the idea of a help group is kind of overbearing for me. But I do think I need to change something. ..Any constructive advice is appreciated. Or telling me I don't have a problem. Let me know. Thanks.

If you drink a six pack every night and you say that 's cutting down then .I think you have a problem. I used alcohol to get to sleep for years. It was a balancing act. If I didn't drink enough I couldn't sleep. But If I had too much I would sleep through the alarm. If I got up in the night to go to the bathroom I would need more to get back to sleep. It got to the point where I needed it just to function. Towards the end I was drinking on the job. It wasn't long before my boss found out. He suggested that I get help if I wanted to continue working for him. That was my turning point...You ask if you can drink moderately. It's the dream of every alcoholic to be able to drink in moderation. But it just doesn't work that way for people like us. Our bodies react differently to alcohol. We just can't stop at one. The only answer is to stop completely. ..Even though it worked for me I realize you don't like the idea of help groups so I won't push you into going to AA but I strongly suggest you do something before you lose your job or worse. You might share with us here at /r/stopdrinking every day and let us know how you're doing. It really helps to talk about it. Your struggles won't be laughed off I promise you. We've all felt what you're feeling. Know that with time it does get better. I wish you the best of luck!
If you are thinking you have a problem with it you probably do...What you do to remedy it is your decision. I will say in the long run I found that quitting it outright was much easier than trying to moderate something I didn't have much control over. Everyone is different though and it's up to you to have that shitfilter for yourself.
You may be able to drink in moderation for a few sessions you will drink 2 beers every night or every other night for a week or two. You will think you have everything under control then all of a sudden one night it will be 3 beers then 4 then oops New Years eve is here time to have 6 again then your buddy is in town and you can make an exception for just more night then you lose your job and its really time to party. You are better off just removing alcohol from your life completely. Learn about the disease of addiction and take this seriously. It can and will ruin your life if left untreated.
There's a self-assessment in the sidebar just above "Related Sub-Reddits" that can be pretty helpful in coming to a decision regarding what's best for you.  Personally I didn't have any dramatic "rock bottom" but I was in the same boat where I wasn't comfortable with my relationship with alcohol and I hadn't had much success with moderation because I would inevitably see my usage creep back up.  I decided to quit while I was ahead because I didn't want to chase the mythical "rock bottom"...I'm also not a big fan of in-person support groups for a multitude of personal reasons (they're a wonderful resource for others).  What worked for me was hanging around this subreddit and doing the CBT-based worksheets on http://www.smartrecovery.org  SMART also has an online meetings if you want to talk to others.  There's also an IRC chat in the sidebar here...As for defeating the voice . . .if you can get rid of the alcohol in your house for the time being.  Cook different things.  Stay busy...Best of luck!
Welcome /u/FithOfNovember to r/stopdrinking--I was not able to moderate my drinking or taper off alcohol because I am an alcoholic and those two approaches to dealing with alcohol required me to continue to drink and if I take one drink--all bets are off in my experience.  this is what I did and what I still do to get and stay sober:..1. Each day when I first wake up--in fact when my eyes open--I make a very conscious and deliberate daily decision not to drink alcohol TODAY and today only--all day no matter what happens good or bad. When I say this I am actually suggesting an almost PHYSICAL ritual that I incorporate every morning when I wake up...2. I go to a recovery meeting (AA meetings for me and I went to 90 meetings in 90 days because the man I asked to be my sponsor suggested that I would do best if I learned to follow directions and that was his first direction). My days sober are directly correlated to my AA attendance and activity aka moving my feet! I can't say enough about how valuable this was in coming to grips with my emotions...3. Tomorrow I repeat...For me in these early days it was super important that I focus only on the 24 hours ahead. If I get to bed sober I win the daily victory over alcohol...We will be here on /r/stopdrinking to support you as long as you need us as a resource...Please keep sharing as you go along.
