I woke up today only on day 2. There's that little twinge of fear deep down that I will fail again but this time I'm in a significantly different place mentally spiritually emotionally and in the process of physically. This summer was a relieving realization and I now know that I will be successful. So much so that even with that little fear lingering I feel an overwhelming sense of relief and excitement. ..I haven't attempted to quit in maybe 6 months. It's been a somewhat rough few years on an private emotional front (very few people know). A few years back I got slapped with some ugly realizations about my childhood which resulted in me having to reevaluate everything that I was. The foundation of my self had been proven to be this fantasy I had concocted and built my identity upon. I'm a pretty decent capable person by everyone's standards but there's always been this secret dysfunction and what I felt to be stunted growth (emotionally socially mentally and spiritually). I felt trapped by my past (which I had imagined to be fantastic) but never understood why. I finally figured it out. I was trapped because it wasn't fantastic it was ugly and my secret dysfunction and stunted growth now made perfect sense. (My mom recently made a comment to me that she was floored once years back when I commented on how great my childhood was and that she knew then that I had a hard road of realizations ahead of me). ..I've been doing everything in my power to basically have to find myself all over again at this age for the past few years. I felt like I was reliving my awkward teen years all over again. If anyone had told me that at this stage in my life (happily married successful career beautiful children financially stable etc) that I'd have to redefine more than half of what I am I would have thought you were ignorant. Yet there I was. I found meditation I went through yoga teacher training I found a new side of spirituality to undo the miserable cult I grew up in I read dozens of self-help books I went to therapy and group classes everything I could think of. ..A few years go by and I hit January 1st 2017 with a promise to myself for the new year. I had given enough of my life the past few years trying to understand and figure out what to do with all this new information. 2017 would be the year I learn to let it all go and move on. Hello summer 2017. I started to get worried. Already half way through the year and I was still int he thick of it. It didn't seem to be getting any better and I was running out of options on where else to turn for relief. Pissed off at myself for still being pissed off by my past and my parents. Then it all clicked. Nothing awe-inspiring. Nothing God-like. Nothing remarkable. No epiphany or "ah-ha" moment. I just happened to notice one day that I was feeling a little better. I was in the middle of another book and suddenly realized I didn't need it and just stopped reading. I didn't suddenly accept my past I finally didn't care. My current life is so fulfilling and rewarding that my past has now (almost) become irrelevant and I understand that. ..We come to September and with this weight being lightened a little bit every day I'm getting to the point where I want to make everything in my life healthier. I've been working on new eating habits my exercising is coming back my projects are being worked on again my sex-drive is coming back my job is becoming inspiring again my physical appearance (clothes/hair/makeup) is looking nicer and I'm happy to be able to say no to people now and stand my ground whenever I need. ..So despite the fact that I have tried to quit in the past and failed I am in a refreshingly happier place. I'm not quitting for a specific reason I'm quitting for all of them. I'm quitting because I don't need it anymore. Needing it again would mean I'm letting my past creep back in to haunt me. It would mean I would have undone all my hard work the past few years and there is no way I'm letting that happen. ..I know there are always ups and downs and that I will most definitely have days I struggle (because everyone struggles it's what makes us human) but I have been slowly finding this new confidence and zest for life that doesn't need alcohol. That gives me the strength and courage to stand up to any of those struggles and to shed all the toxic baggage I unknowingly carried with me all these years. ..I made that vow 1/1/17 to be completed by 1/1/18 and I still have four months to go. I know I can do this and I know I will not drink with you today.

Reads like an amazing journey. The letting go the "this doesn't matter anymore" or "this isn't relevant to me anymore" is recognizable. Thanks for putting some of my feelings into words...Here's to staying aware and awake to being careful anyway -- and to another day of not drinking!
