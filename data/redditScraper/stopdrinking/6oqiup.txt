Wowowoow...I cannot believe I am just one month and two days away from completing a year of sobriety!! ..Some things I have gained:..- a better closer relationship with my parents and siblings free of guilt..- an appreciation for all that I have in life. A roof over my head a warm bed (sometimes too warm! Thanks Texas) stable income great co-workers supportive friends....- the ability to stay motivated about tasks like registering for school keeping my room and kitchen clean doing the laundry.....- exploring new hobbies that had taken a back seat like reading for leasure practicing spirituality working out (though this could still be done more!) cooking finding new teas to drink...I have so much I have gained and have so much more to learn. I just picked up My Naked Mind today and have decided to read it due to all the praise it gets. Not because I have been struggling lately but because I'm determined to learn more about what I am dealing with here. ..If you are wondering how I did this or how you will make it till tomorrow or just the next few hours just know that I have been in your shoes before. ..All it takes is a decision to deny the temptation to take that first drink and that's it. Everything else is just working on development to resolve the things that lead you to drinking and just healing yourself. ..I'll answer any questions! I'm currently 24 years old and this is the decision I've ever made. .."It works if you put in the work."
