Death is always challenging to deal with. .The things that I thought about was that..It's ok to feel bad..I wanna drink but that doesn't change that he's dead..Remember the good times even if they were good times when drinking. Then it was a different time in my life and now that I'm not drinking doesn't mean that I didn't enjoy my time with him drinking or not. ..I don't drink anymore I won't drink because I lost him. ..I will remember him and honor his life. Even without the booze. ..Rest easy my friend I won't drink with you anymore. ...Keep in mind folks of SD you don't need the drink to celebrate life or to drown feelings. Things will happen life has struggles and I always have to be mindful that drinking doesn't ever help. Thanks as always guys for you all have been my crutch so far.

I'm so very sorry for the loss of your friend. You are right that drinking won't bring him back or make it hurt less. If anything drinking will only prolong the pain. Stay strong and take care of yourself. &lt;3
That's great you are honoring him and remembering him sober.  I won't drink with you today.
