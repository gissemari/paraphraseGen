Cravings hit me hard yesterday and today. There was money in my bank account and my husband goes back to work today after being off for several days so I knew that I was in the danger zone for relapse. My account isn't the main bank account for our household so I took all the money in my account (it isn't a lot) and reloaded my Amazon account so I wouldn't be tempted to buy alcohol. I'm pretty sure if I had that cash I'd already be at the store. It's terrifying to know how fragile my sobriety really is BUT I recognized the situation before it became a relapse and forced myself into dealing with it before I could make poor choices. ..This is what sobriety is really about for me. Working through the times when it's hard by doing whatever it takes to stay sober. These cravings will pass.

That sounds like a good trick! The first few months were full of those sorts of things for me and I ate a LOT of ice cream.
The good news is the longer you stay off the sauce the less frequent and urgent the cravings become until they pretty much stop happening altogether!..I found the [videos on overcoming cravings](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=this+naked+mind+overcoming+cravings) from the 'This Naked Mind' channel really helpful.....Keep up the good work and keep us posted!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
