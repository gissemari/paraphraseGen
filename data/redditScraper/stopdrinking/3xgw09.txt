I posted a few days ago about recent cravings I've been having and I'm still struggling with those (although I did get some awesome advice from commenters thank you!) ..I'm trying to remind myself that waking up on Christmas morning without a hangover will be so nice (a couple of years ago I got so shitfaced on mulled wine on Christmas eve that I could barely keep from throwing up during the unwrapping of presents on Christmas morning...fun times!)..However! One major positive change from not drinking that I have to report is my weight loss. I have a small frame and the weight from my drinking never sat naturally on me I always looked bloated and puffy. Since I've quit drinking I've lost 15 lbs and gone down two pants sizes. A couple months ago I bought a couple pairs of size 8 jeans and they are now too big on me so yesterday I got to buy jeans in a size 6 for the first time in YEARS. ..I have lots of other positive differences in my life since cutting out booze but it's nice to have actual tangible results to feel good about and give me reasons to add to my "why I shouldn't give in and buy a bottle of wine for Christmas" list.

I wont be drinking over Christmas I drank all the time so to me xmas was just another day to me of getting pissed not this year well done on your 106 days.
This actually inspired me..Wow. I need to lose weight. The wine has taken a toll on me too...weight-wise. I am about 40 lbs. overweight so thank you for this!..Congrats on 106!
Congrats on the weight loss! My dumb ass just replaced alcohol calories with pizza rolls and office sweets so no skinny for me. I know NYR are kinda horse shit but I made a deal with myself if I could just focus on not drinking until the year-end that I would clean up my diet come January 1st. We'll see!
