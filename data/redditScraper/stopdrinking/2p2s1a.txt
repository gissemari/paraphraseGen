I've spent most of this year sober. I have been feeling a bit like a bum so I starting thinking of what I've done this year and the list is better than I thought. The biggest thing is that I haven't spent most of it drinking. ..My first distraction getting sober besides reading this sub was video games. I haven't played loads of games but a few were:.* Star Wars The Old Republic.* Tomodachi Life (3DS boring but a distraction).* Fantasy Life (3DS really excellent)..* Knitted most of one pair of socks (nearly done!).* Made a bunch of homemade ornaments out of old light bulbs I've been collecting all year ribbon scraps and a hot glue gun.* Practiced my instrument (maybe not as much as I could but still..).* Planted two square foot gardens in my backyard.* Had a cooking class in my house.* Hiked up a local mountain about a dozen times.* Bought assembled and regularly used a treadmill.* Installed hooks on my porch for holiday lights.* Cooked at home a lot more.* Had blinds installed in some of my windows.* Taken a fall beach/bicycling mini-vacation..Watched a CRAP TON on Netflix:..* Eureka.* House M.D. (twice once on my own once with my daughter).* Scrubs.* Sherlock.* Grey's Anatomy (god why?  lol running out of stuff I haven't seen...)..I think the TV watching is why I feel like a bum. I put a lot of pressure on myself normally and my counselor has suggested I let up some. (huh you think??) So I'm working on that. I get the things done that need to be done and then my free time is FREE from pressure in theory. ..Last year I wouldn't have been able to imagine a sober holiday. This year it seems like a no-brainer. There are so many ways to celebrate without drinking... good food lights (my favorite) music board gaming... last year I woke up on Christmas Day hung over (because we had our "Christmas" on the 24th) and I'm so happy that won't be the case this year. ..So many Christmas Eves in the past I tried to "take it easy" so as not to ruin Christmas morning and I usually accomplished that but it was a struggle and I made up for it the next night. This really does feel like freedom. ..I guess one down side is that I am only attending one holiday party (the one I judge to be "safe" for me) but for an extreme introvert that's not a huge sacrifice. When I was married we used to go to company parties which was just an excuse to drink way too much. The party that I'm going to this year will be family friendly and maybe people will be drinking (I honestly don't know it's early afternoon I expect a few light drinkers) but the focus will be on friends and food.

Good to hear from you.  Sounds to me like you had a good year. At least you can remember it.  I Know that was always a problem for me in the past.  Glad you are doing well now go finish them socks the year ain't over yet and enjoy your Christmas.
