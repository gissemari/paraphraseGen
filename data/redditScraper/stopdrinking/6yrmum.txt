So for my birthday a few months ago my good friend got us tickets for a comedy show. And when I realized my 500th day was coming up I checked to see what day it would fall so I could plan something fun... and yep the comedy show is tonight :) :) :)..So tonight on my 500th day without drinking I'll be going to an amazing churrasco dinner followed by a comedy festival! I already looked at the menu of what they serve and it looks amazing! Can't think of ANYTHING better to celebrate than to spend the evening gorging on amazing food then laughing with my best friend :) ..Just wanted to brag a little bit!! And say how grateful I am to this community for helping me get started on this journey. I'm finally learning who I am and getting motivated to set my life on the course I want. After many years struggling as a single parent (not that I'm not still struggling as a single parent haha but..) I'm finally getting back on track financially and organized with all the work/school/life balance ... I could never have imagined my life could be so full and just so easy and enjoyable. So happy to be a part of this place &lt;3 &lt;3
