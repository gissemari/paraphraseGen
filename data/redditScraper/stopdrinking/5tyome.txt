I'm not normally a superstitious person but early sobriety is making me weird...For example I haven't got a badge because every time I did that in the past I relapsed...I also didn't clean my apartment for the first two weeks because every time I did that in the past I relapsed. (It's clean now don't worry).."Whatever it takes" amirite

"Whatever it takes" -- exactly!
Sounds like you are determined to make this time different however you can which is great! Won't be drinking with you today. 
Yep whatever it takes!.I'm superstitious about going to this one AA meeting. I go to meetings regularly but there's this one meeting that I used to love however the last two times I relapsed I drank pretty soon after that specific meeting. At this point I'm not even questioning it I'm just going to an alternative and going with it.
"Whadevuhitakes"     Would make a good tattoo!
I used to sober up and then run around like a lunatic trying to clean grocery shop and basically "cover up" my benders because if it all LOOKS good then it didn't happen right???
