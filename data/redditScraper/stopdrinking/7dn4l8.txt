Well i made it through last weekend - seems like sat. Afternoons are the most tempting time for me to just slip into my favorite craft beer bar and try and have  just one delicious ipa  .  I passed it up last Sat and thankfully someone at work invited me too a volunteer function sat  . Afternoon ! So I will be killing two birds with one stone - finally making professional relationships and attempting to schmooze and take a stab at   developing  more of a career and being more involved with my new company ( a goal I've have always set for myself but never followed through on anywhere because of anxiety and hangovers and desires to go to bars instead ) and Not drinking with you all in a Sat afternoon .  I feel like making these sober commitments will hopefully stop a relapse in its tracks and now I have another good reason not to drink tonight too and something small to look forward too!  Thanks for your support ! I will not drink with y'all today and this weekend !
