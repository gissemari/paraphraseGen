I started drinking like most people underage beers here party drinking in my early 20's. I'm almost 30 now and started experiencing frequent blackouts almost every time I drink. I recently fell hit my head and had to go to the hospital. I have other medical bills from alcohol-related anxiety. I have tried self-help some therapy and online support groups. I even contacted a well-known hospital that specializes in addictions and who didn't seem to address my concerns seriously making me think perhaps I was overreacting. .Alcohol is ruining my life friendships self-respect health. I am an excellent student and employee but skip class or work while hungover shame-spiralling in bed feeling like death sleeping on and off and barely leaving my room. This occurs at least once a week if not more and after a few days I somehow convince myself that I'm going to drink a glass of wine with dinner or have "a" beer with a friebd though I know I'm never that person and never will be. I always end up drinking far beyond the intended amount and wake up filled with anxiety and fear at what I might have said or done lost phones ridiculous bar tabs and booze-related expenses poor decisions. I am so tired of feeling like shit all the time. I want nothing more than sobriety. I am seeing a psychiatrist who is aware of my issues (alcohol and anxiety) and who may prescribe me naltrexone. I want to check out an AA meeting tomorrow. I'm fairly new to support groups as I have mostly kept my drinking to myself and a few close friends who know I struggle but don't know the fullness and complexity of this terrible affliction. Thanks for listening. Any advice or information is appreciated.

Just get into a meeting and feel it out. I didn't say a word for months but I did like the feeling of community being in a room where everyone was battling the same thing. Talk if your feeling it but don't force yourself out there if your not ready. 
Thanks for advice/thoughts everyone. Just reading posts on here reflects so many of my own thoughts and experiences. It's refreshing.
