Hey everyone I just made it to one year without booze and wanted to type out a few thoughts...I've been a heavy drinker since around 2007-2008. I've been trying to get sober alone since 2012 and with help since about August 2014. I've always been one to not look to others for help and sometimes refuse help which in retrospect has certainly been detrimental to my success. For a long time I had a negative view of AA which certainly didn't help matters either...At the beginning of 2016 I finally found something that has been working for me. It's an outpatient clinic where I see a therapist and a psychiatrist and they work directly with me. One of the things I love about it is how they are continuously integrating new research into addiction into their practices...I've made a lot of changes over the last year. I've been meditating and practicing mindfulness. Started exercising. Started eating healthier. My relationship with my family is being repaired (especially with my mother). I'm lucky enough to be close to an Agnostic AA meeting that I've been going to. I'm actually accomplishing things I want to do instead of getting drunk every night (and being useless every day because of it). My mind is clear in a way I had forgotten about. There are still times that I miss drinking but a playback of "the tape" helps to alleviate that :)..TL:DR; Sober one year. If you're struggling there's something out there that will help you. Don't feel bad asking for help!
