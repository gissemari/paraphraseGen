I know there are people here that take a pill that makes you sick if you drink on it. If so what is it are there any other side affects? Is it a one two month deal and your doctor took you off?  I'm needing a reset again and been struggling hard the last week.  Just considering other options..

Antabuse.  Other side effects can include seizures and death if you drink.  Not a fan.  ..Naltrexone is another option.  It's an opiod receptor blocker that has shown effectiveness in some studies in helping reduce or stop drinking.  Way less side effects.
The pill you're referring to is called 'Antabuse' if you want to look into it.....I've no experience of it myself other than what I've read but if you're struggling on your own it's a good idea to explore the medical options with your doctor!..Other medications which can be used in the treatment of alcoholism include Naltrexone (in conjunction with the 'Sinclair Method') Baclofen Acamprosate etc... they all have a slightly different mechanism of action so start doing your research and have a word with your doctor to get an assessment!..Hope that helps ..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
