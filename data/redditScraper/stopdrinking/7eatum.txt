But the beast is gone (or at least dormant). As an atheist in AA the subject of religion is always popping up. I have been lucky enough to find a small group of nonbelievers who were starting up an agnostic "Live And Let Live" AA group nearly two years ago. I had tried and failed to find sobriety several times prior to meeting this group of like minded alcoholics. Some of them had decades of sobriety under their belts. I am so thankful that they started this group that literally saved my life. I was looking for solid real world advice on how "I" could take certain steps to improve myself. I had tried other AA meetings and the message of letting some unseen (and in my opinion imaginary) god fix my problems for me just did not work for me. Meeting and talking with other non-religious people who have had success helped me to see that it was possible. I have been transformed by sobriety. My life is 10 times better today than it was 2 years ago. My health has rebounded. I have lost over 100 pounds. My doctors says all my bloodwork is in normal ranges. I landed a great new job/career and am excelling in my field. My wife and children say I have become the person they always hoped and new I could be. .The beast has been tamed. I look forward to each new day and am so happy I found this small wonderful group who helped me get on the right path for me. If you are struggling out there don't be afraid to seek out other groups and like minded sobernauts. We come from all walks of life and with every mindset and outlook. Find "Your Group" and discover your inner potential that can be set free in sobriety. At 47 years old I feel like my life is just starting. I wish the same for you!

Thank you. This post really spoke to me. I appreciate you and hope you have a fulfilling day!
My friends had a nickname for me when that "beast" used to come out. I would get so dark that sometimes my ex would literally run when he saw that demonic glint in my eyes. I never was violent or anything like that but I'd say horrible things to people that I thought were true so as to "help them" with their flaws. So what if it was true? It was never my place to act like that. I'm ashamed of how cruel I could be and I'm happy to have that dark self banished safely from me and everyone in my vicinity. 
Hey nosuperstitions so great that you found your group. I can't say I'm an atheist or a believer either. My path falls into 'non-duality' I suppose closer to Buddhism but not really. That would be very cool to find a group as powerful as AA without the traditional God stuff -- I haven't come across one but I hear there is a Secular AA and an Agnostics and Freethinkers. Meetings are few and far between though I think?..Whenever I share at a meeting I just talk about the practical side of things my thinking what worked for me. I agree there are all different mindsets in AA. The ones who don't follow the 'party line' aren't usually the ones who talk the loudest in my experience...Congrats on your newfound life. *Don't* have a beastly day! :)
Totally awesome. 
Wow that's great!  
I personally also avoided AA in the past because of the religion thing despite it working for my own father who hasen't drunk in 30 years and I tried other things instead which I was not successful with. Recently I read Russell Brand's new book Recovery (I know I keep harping on about this) and he explained the 12 Steps in a very different way and now I think the religious bit is probably over-stated and I've decided I'm going to go to a meeting. Excellent refrence in the title &amp; I wish you the best of luck =)
Congratulations !!

Ooh... I've found a friend.  In lots of ways.  I have never actually attended an AA meeting but have talked to lots that have in my 'other' meetings.  .My nickname was chosen on purpose and reflects some of your thoughts. ."I landed a great new job/career and am excelling in my field. My wife and children say I have become the person they always hoped and new I could be. " Is what makes me tick and what I am striving for.  I'd better succeed or I'll be on the dung heap.  So there you go.  Thank you.  And congratulations..
For anyone in the Pacific Northwest we've got 6 agnostic groups between Olympia and Tacoma. Let me know if you need a list.
Congrats man! If I had found a group like that I would have joined too. As it is /r/stopdrinking has to be my "atheist AA" group. :) Luckily it works wonders!
"the Lord works in mysterious ways..." Just kidding...well sort of! ..I'm not part of AA but regardless of whether one believes in God or not...it's clear that alcohol can be the devil to all. 
I actually attended an agnostic meeting on Saturday. I happened to be in the area and thought "Why not?" I've worked the program for a long time and I've always struggled with an HP. A woman at this meeting said that "Reality is her higher power." That was like a lightning bolt to me - it makes a ton of sense. I'll be going back to that meeting on a regular basis.
Congrats. In am still riding the beast. 
Thanks for this post..Agnostic in AA here - there are many non believers and even more seriously backslid folks in AA - and even the devout whatevers don't give a hoot so long as I don't preach my non beliefs - and for the most part they don't preach either...I did have to learn to be more tolerant of those with faith.  but that has turned out to not be such a bad thing...
I love posts like these. Inspiring. I will not drink with you today.
Awesome work  \m/ ..I just discovered that there's a SMART recovery group in my town but I'm scared to go..
Nice! I am an atheist in AA too. I can relate. 
Huge congratulations! I have some genuine inquiries and I hope they don't come off as critical. Whatever keeps you sober happy and healthy is worth continuing...How do you do AA without a higher power? I mean the steps? They pretty much all direct you to do things with a higher power...And in addition isn't the big book really clear about it's emphasis on God? I mean it has a whole chapter addressing people who don't believe in God. It is the core principal. It's just not clear to me how you could take the God out of AA and still have AA...I want to repeat that whatever works is *good.* I just never understood this.
Hilarious! I swear to God I just put Iron Maiden's Number of the Beast on my running playlist and I was listening to it today....blast from the past. Not drinking with you tonight. HAHAHA....Congrats all your hard work and kickass results!
Secular humanist here 46 right behind you on badge day count..Congrats. I haven't enjoyed quite the same mental/physical transformation but it's still my proudest achievement. No higher power required. For others if belief in a higher power helps you well then that's great too!
Thanks for sharing. I have a hard time with all of the Higher Power stuff that AA meetings are so centered on. Religion though is not what Higher Power is; a lot of people in AA look to God- but it is really focused on spiritual progress versus religious beliefs.
Thanks for posting this. So many ppl in AA tell me to simply disregard the religious aspects and this did not work for me. When I told them this didn't work for me they responded in such a way to imply that I was not wanting to be sober. This dogmatic view really bothered me so it's nice hearing from someone that there are groups out there that have a secular approach! ..Anyway I think I will look into this as well as SMART recovery meetings...Thanks again!
Wow. Congrats 666.  Thank you for sharing your inspiring story. 
Your post gives me hope. I attended my first ever meeting last night. Like you I've always used my atheism as a solid excuse to avoid the group and keep getting drunk and being self destructive. It was a good experience and I will go back. There was a guy there was has been sober over a decade who told me he's not religious  but he said the fellowship and accountability of his home group to be his higher power. I'm happy to be sober with you for today
Awesome post congrats!!
This is awesome.  I was feeling stalled out and not liking meetings around me as much coming up on two years and I found a secular group finally.  I love it and I want secular aa available every day of the week.  I couldn't believe in a supernatural being and I certainly couldn't "turn it over" to "His Will" (emphasis male).  I still owe a lot to traditional aa for getting me this far but today I prefer my secular meeting and would probably never attend another traditional meeting if there were more secular meetings.  
Thank you for your courage to post!
