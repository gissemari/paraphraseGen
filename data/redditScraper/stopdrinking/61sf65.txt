So at the place where I volunteer they said I could not hang out then when I have been drinking..I hang out there off duty but I never drank on duty..They have a pub/bar right next to the place where all the volunteers go...I know I am in the wrong and I just feel so embarrased and ashamed....This was my place to help others while I stopped drinking....I don't think I can ever go back there!.I am on day 2 and just want to bury myself...my anxiety in sky high right now..I just had an operation and went in there to say hi as I've been gone a week and that is when one of the directors told me.....Please excuse any errors...I am on ipad and cannot see the whole text...I am doing lots of things like reading The Naked Mind taking a Mindfulness course see a therapist am on antidepressants...why do I keep relapsing?????.
