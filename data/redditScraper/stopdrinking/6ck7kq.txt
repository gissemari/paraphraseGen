I knew I was either going to be making a relapse or triumph post today. And it's triumph!..I visited my brother over the weekend and he always has his fridge stocked with beer and liquor. As a weekend ritual he invites his friends over to sit around play games and drink beer...I knew this was a test for me and away the night went. There was temptation and justification thinking if I had a drink. "I will only have one or two." "I will drink it slowly." I never allowed myself to have the one. I want to bed sober!..As I was heading to bed I told my brother that I was trying to be good and he said he noticed. I said "I was thinking of allowing myself only one." His reply was what I needed to hear. "Yeah but many more would follow." And he's right. So I went to the guest bedroom without one and fell asleep. Yay! I was afraid of a reset but now I feel prouder than over...I will not drink with you all tonight!

An NDV to be proud of.  It's just one day at a time. 
That's great!!! Imagine how you would feel if you had given in to the craving. Instead you can wake up feeling proud!
Way to go!  And it's great that your brother is so supportive. 
Nice job!  
Awesome post! Congrats
