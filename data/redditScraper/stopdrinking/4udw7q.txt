I am an introvert and since the first sip I've used drinking/drugs to transform into the fun extroverted party person. Of course that didn't always work and often backfired but it was the only somewhat reliable way or so i thought...But a couple times now I have been able to achieve the extroverted state without any substances at all. I was comfortable and confident and made people laugh and full of energy. And the next morning I got out of bed on time and made it to my group fitness class...This is a huge milestone for me. I have proved to myself I don't need alcohol to be fun. The most important part is that I have narrowly escaped relapse several times lately and a driving force there was that I just wanted to be able to be fun again.

Me too.  I even *enjoyed* dancing with my wife at a recent wedding.  I probably didn't look any worse than when I was drunk. At least no one said "Hey dude you better have a couple pops before you try that again."  The rationalization about being more social when drunk is a dangerous notion.
I feel the same way. You have inspired me. Keep it up!  
This is awesome! 
You give me hope. Thanks for sharing.
Awesome!!
I'm glad I read this. I went to a sober party a few nights ago and I felt pretty uncomfortable. No one else was drinking so there was no temptation. I just saw how extroverted everyone else was while sober and I clammed up and missed being the outgoing person I was while drinking. I'm glad to know I don't have to wait too long for that to come naturally 
&gt;But a couple times now I have been able to achieve the extroverted state without any substances at all...That's awesome. It's so much better too right?
