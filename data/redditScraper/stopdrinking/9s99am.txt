I don't know why its never worked before. In the past I've dropped partners for trying to make me chose between them and whatever my substance of choice was. .However a few days ago I relapsed and drank. My partner was incredibly hurt and it made me realise the impact my actions have on the people around me. He's more recently asked me to try not to take anything outside of what I'm given by a doctor or cannabis and it feels like its finally set in my head that I can and will do this. I can't take putting him through what he went through while I was drunk and then more or less unconscious again. I just can't do that to him..It's bizzar that knowing the damage it did to me wouldnt make me stop but knowing it upsets him in the slightest makes me more determined than I have ever been to get this chapter of my life behind me..I'm about to start day 4..IWNDWYT.
