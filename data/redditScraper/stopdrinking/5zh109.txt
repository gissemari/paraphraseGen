[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy Hump Day! What's Up Wednesdays are when we celebrate our sobriety see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** I took a print-making workshop. The first triumph was that I was able to stay present physically for the whole class. (Last time I kept having to leave to go to the bathroom and have a drink from the bottle in my purse.) The second was that the work I produced in the workshop was not great but it didn't matter. I thought -- it isn't important that I make a masterpiece. What *is* important is that I participate in life...**Struggle:** I don't go to bars anymore. It's kind of like a vegan going to a meat-eating contest -- there really isn't any point. But I went to a pub recently because it was where some friends were meeting and it was harder to be there than I expected. Not exactly cravings but a weird sort of  blast from the past  nostalgia for my youth. I got myself out of there as quickly as I could...**General:** Did you know that St. Patrick's real name was Maewyn Succat? I've got an idea; let's invent a new holiday! On Saturday the day after St. Patrick's Day we will celebrate NOT waking up with a hangover. ..**Happy Maewyn Succat's Day everyone!**.

No drinking for me day 11
Triumph: didn't drink at the St Patrick's Parade or at post-parade parties last Saturday. It's probably the biggest drinking day of the year in Dallas and has tripped up my attempts at sobriety on more than a few occasions so it felt good to finally not embarrass myself while wasting hundreds of dollars...Struggle: work is kicking my ass and my insecurity issues are standing in the way of me asking for help. I'm deathly afraid of being let go which would make me feel so bad about myself (but wouldn't be the end of the world since not drinking has allowed me to save up a good amount). It's not the best feeling. ..General: my holiday is Cinco de Pancakes. On the fifth of each month we all shall eat pancakes and prosper. 
**Triumph:** It's nearly the end of week 2 day 1. I mowed the lawns and walked the dogs in the afternoon heat (it's the first month of Autumn here). All I want is a beer after but I haven't gone to get one (aka 12)...**Struggle:** I've lost a bit of momentum. Instead of the vivid memories of embarrassment and choking anxiety I'm getting into that lazy stage where drinking doesn't seem that bad of an idea. It **IS** a **VERY BAD IDEA**.
**Triumph**: Ummm... it feels hard to find one on a day like today.  But I did get to a meeting and opened up to a good friend/best friend about my struggles...**Struggle**: I will be heading into work tomorrow - just a few days after I blacked out at a work related function at the office.  How bad was I?  How many of them know?  Will I be fired/reprimanded?  The anxiety and fear is just kinda soul crushing.  I don't know if I've ever felt this broken by my alcoholism - ever.  Which is crazy cause I've done some horrible shit.  
*Triumph*: Celebrated international womens day in a cool way last week.  I took my girls to my boxing gym and we threw down and bonded through lots and lots of sweating (Who needs a happy hour or boozy brunch to bond these days anyways?!)...*Struggle*: Stopping drinking has been a very personal journey for me with limited info given to my family and friends (Nobody has really asked why or even brought it up).  This week I'm feeling a bit of guilt on not being boldly open with my decision stemming from receiving my year coin and not showing it to anybody.  I chatted with my therapist about this and she says it's MY journey and I don't owe anybody but myself answers and next steps (Especially if they're not asking).  If sobriety has been more personal to you how have you handled these thoughts?..*General*: I have the best shoes to wear for St Paddy's Day and CAN'T WAIT to rock them!  http://www.sneakerfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/airstab2.jpg
testing my flair
Triumph: It's been two months. As the days were aproaching I was excited. And I'm still pretty pumped but now it feels almost surreal. This is the longest I have gone without a drink since about 15 or 16. I am 25 so 10 years was quite a lot of my life. ..Struggle: Random brain invasions saying maybe it's OK to have a glass of wine now. Not today stupid brain not today...General: I'm working all day St. Patricks at the sports bar and am actually kind of excited. On days like that I would be peeved about being there all day... waiting for my turn to play catch up on alcohol. I'm excited to make a lot of money excel at my job because I'm working with a clear mind and... the coolest... my regulars know about my sobriety and are actually really proud of me.. any maybe a little surprised haha...Happy Maewyn Succat's Day to you all I couldn't not drink without you. 
Triumph: I started running and I'm keeping at it. ..Struggle: I'm really sick and tired of my sobriety. I'm keeping at it but I've really hit a wall...General: My dog nearly murdered me in my sleep the other night. He had gotten up (to get some water or something I assume) and decided his favorite toy a duck should join us in bed. The duck quacks. Unaware - and asleep - I rolled over onto the duck and it went QUACK. Scared the shit out of me.
Good morning!.I will not drink today!.Triumph: I sent out invitations for my son's 6th birthday party.Struggle:  Cleaning getting rid of clutter (My house still looks like one of an alcoholic).General:  My first triathlon is in 1.5 weeks!!!  But it's too cold here this week to get into the pool :)  Happy Wednesday! 
T:  weight loss!  about to be under 200 for 1st time in ~15 yrs!  looking forward to singles (tennis) season in few weeks!..S:  motivation (general not SD)  hard to separate cause &amp; effect but drinking definitely let me ignore (and/or contributed to) an overall generalized lack of motivation..G:  been over a year since I had a diet coke!  I'll OCCASIONALLY (like once/month) have a Truvia but NOTHING with aspartame or actual sugar!  between that &amp; SD dentist has noticed/asked what I've changed?  :)/:(
Triumph: I made it through an unexpected 4 day weekend and the current snowpocalypse we have going on! Very glad I fought the urges and the snow and I'm safe and not hungover at work right now. ..Struggle: See above. Thursday afternoon was really tough after I found out there would be no work again on Friday. Then last night with all the closings rolling in I thought for sure work would be closed today so why not drink it up. I'm very happy not drinking but my brain seems to still be an opportunistic asshole that will try to get me to drink whenever it can. ..General: I was out for trivia the other night and they were giving out whisky samples in honor of St. Patrick's day. Jeez people it's not a week long holiday. I will definitely be staying in for the actual day and celebrating no hangover with a big cup of coffee!
Triumph:  DOUBLE DIGIT DAYS!! I literally don't remember the last time this happened...Struggle: I have a weekend trip planned with 2 friends leaving Friday. We've had it booked for months. I'm committed to not drinking but one of the 2 friends loves to lay on the pressure. On one of my past attempts to quit I remember her saying "you're just going to drink again." I guess it's a good sign that remembering that makes me angry now and if she says it again I have a response - "maybe but not today." ..General: not happy at all about having to leave in an hour for class in this weather. 
**Triumph** I've been incredibly productive at work lately getting the # of account activations in one week that I would used to get in 1 month!!! Huzzah...**Struggle** long distance relationships suck..**General** Did y'all know Zurich was just ranked #2 quality of life city to live in the world? I should move there one day! :)
Triumph: Made it three days sober and got a full 8 hours of sleep last night. This sure does feel great...Struggle: Getting through my fourth day but SD has been a great resource for getting through these past few days. ..Today I will not drink.
**Triumph:** I began taking care of my teeth when I sobered up. I'm going into for surgical evaluation today. Not because there is another problem to fix but to determine a proactive treatment plan.  I fucking hate dental work so this is big...**Struggle:** Been fighting a cold. It's also the end of my work week with crazy hours and very disrupted sleep. Add the time change and my internal clock is all fucked up...**General:** I finally listened to one of [Brother Ali's new tracks](https://youtu.be/bBbdod-_C7E). It's just what I needed and I've played it a bunch already.
Triumph: Made it to day five and (gasp) actually looking forward to more sober days this time! Six days ago I'd expected to die drunk and young....Struggle: I've been crying 4-5 time a day since quitting drinking. I don't mind crying I've always been overly emotional but walking around with my eyes super red and puffy is embarrassing. ...
Triumph: 4 digit club today. Celebrating by going on a 12 mile run and eating an absolutely disgustingly high caloric content burger. Someone stop this mad man. 
[removed]
**Triumph:** Went to my first AA meeting. A good bunch of people and I feel like I have made a positive step...**Struggle:** Still in that black despair hole after a binge and not able to sleep well
I'm like 15 days from 3 months sober!
"What IS important is that I participate in life."  THIS...**Triumph:**  Dealt with some highly stressful information that was threatening to imbed itself in my body by going for a walk and releasing it through lots of deep breathing and acknowledging that this was NOT my stress to take on.  It worked!  NDV!..**Struggle:**  GF may have to declare bankruptcy and I am not able to simply have a live-in partner able to pay their end of the mortgage.  I'm not making my goals because of this and having to live more rigidly in order to keep on track.  It's frustrating and I'm trying to keep a generous mindset and acknowledge that people make mistakes and this is my partner I'm desiring to support through a hard process.  AND my damned ATM card was hacked so I lost $200 in fraudulent charges.  Grrr.....**General:** I just wanna live on a small farm raise veggies and farm yard animals and play outside in my free time.  And travel.  And it all starts with paying off my car and investing in sprucing up my house.  I think.  Clearly feeling a little whiney.  Ah well.
Had a very rough morning. I feel like I am a ball of anger/volatility. Wish I could take some time alone to rest up but I realize I have to get better at personal interactions and not jumping to conclusions. I'm going to practice letting things happen and not worrying so much about what I can and can't control or how I perceive I'm being treated by others. Got to relax. Breathe. Let it be.
Triumph: had zoodles with a mixed juice and water for dinner. ..Struggle: I did sorta kinda want a nice cold beer instead. 
T:  Plugging away at school.   I missed class today cause my daughter is sick.  She's feeling much better now...S:  I found myself at bar over the weekend.   I got out pretty quickly especially after I realized that there is absolutely no reason for me to be here...G:  In my part of the US we stuff ourselves with corned beef and cabbage in honor of st Patrick's day.  I may wake-up a little dehydrated the day after but I won't be hungover. 
Triumph: I started back the gym this week...Struggle: I'm irrationally angry and annoyed at everyone today. I want roll up in a ball under a blanket and cry about it. But they frown on that at work. Sigh...At least I'm not drinking about it so there's that. And I just realized today is Day 10. Double digits!
Triumph: On Sunday I got up at what was basically 5 am (DST and all that) and went to an aquarium - it's something that wouldn't have been possible for me a few weeks ago...Struggle: I'm having a lot of issues with procrastination. ..General: I've been reading a lot of good books lately. Looking forward to a St. Patty's day at home with some movies &amp; my SO.
**Triumph:** Client picking up a national award. I know it's not me directly but I'm chuffed for them all the same and it's something I can use as promotional evidence when I need to. ..**Struggle:** After having had several weeks of being pretty motivated work-wise I've lost it a bit this week. It happens from time to time and doesn't last anywhere near as long now I'm sober. ..I know it's probably my mind making me take a bit of a break it just makes me feel a bit guilty for slacking. ..**General:** I can't think why he changed his name to Patrick... :-)
**Triumph:** Day 4 for me I've decide to give it up after three years of struggle. ..   **Struggle:** I quit for about 30 days three years ago and tried to convince myself I had it under control.  I work the night shift so week days are reasonably easy for me as I get home and go straight to sleep.  I'm off tomorrow and know my drinking buddies will want to coax me out to drink and watch basketball.  The anxiety is setting in. ..   **General:**I bought a few culinary books. I am looking forward to developing my culinary skills opposed to getting drunk and hoping my food tastes ok.
Triumph: another weekend without drinking (weeks were rarely that risky). Went to a friend's place at the weekend where there was drink and drugs but I didn't partake and felt great about it the next day...Struggle: taking work more seriously...sometimes too seriously (teacher). I got so annoyed tonight at the lack of care in some of my pupils' writing-it didn't even make sense! Argh! Thumped the pile of books repeatedly and roared into a cushion making myself hoarse...General: watching Rick and Morty is an amazing way to unwind.
Triumph: I set a goal of no alcohol for one week with my therapist and husband in support. With the help of SD I kept going beyond the week and got to twelve days!! Felt great...Struggle: Then I caved. I reset my badge but now I need to reset it again or just suspend it for a while. I feel sad. I met and exceeded my goal of one week sobriety but now I feel like I've let myself down. I know my therapist would encourage me to look at it differently and feel good about the work I'm putting in and the progress I'm making bit by bit. She is on leave for a few weeks though...General: I know that some next steps for me are:.- Set another concrete goal I think a longer one this time like 30 days. With my therapist &amp; husband on board..- Go to yoga. I've been doing a Qi Gong class and an Aqua Yoga class and these help so much making me feel GOOD in a much better way than how alcohol made me feel..- Get more hypnosis/meditation tracks to listen to right before bed and upon waking up. (If you have faves let me know of recommendations?).- GO TO MEETINGS. My town has a ton of AA meetings I could be going to *and* we have some Refuge Recovery meetings here (it's like Buddhist AA). I am Asperger's but that's NOT a valid excuse for not going to meetings. I know meetings will be a necessary support for me to get and STAY sober...OK thank you SD you are my lighthouse.   
**Triumph:** I reached my 18 months free from alcohol on Monday.  I have been sleeping like a stone and it previously had not been that way for a loooong time.   I've met a girl and I'm not falling head-over-heels in love just because she's being nice to me.  For the first time ever I'm staring to keep things in perspective - a baffling yet warm n fuzzy feeling!..**Struggle:** I am still resenting the heck out of my wife.  I keep thinking about all the wrongs and injustices.  I'm struggling to keep in focus that she's also a very sick person and has been since I knew her...**General:** I have been praying and meditating in the mornings again.  I've also been gaining a lot of new subscribers to my very tiny YouTube channel which has been rewarding.  I credit the hobby with de-isolating me greatly and serving as a safe bridge between my blossoming sobriety and the need to interact with the world out there.  Now I can meet total strangers and have 2 hour conversations.
