This sub has so much positive energy.  I check it regularly and truly care about you all your successes and struggles.  When I think about how alone I feel sometimes I check this sub and am reminded that I am not alone and there are so many people who want to change their lives for the better.  Thinking about its force it actually gives me a buzz!  Thanks so much to those who make time to moderate this sub and to all of you beautiful people who are finding their way day by day.

Definitely! SD is awesome. Yesterday I was really in a bad mood and sad after going to an iffy meeting. Posting about it here completed perked me up and within an hour I was level headed and feeling good...I also care about you guys and try to read every post I can. If you are new here please jump in. We would love to hear from you and won't think you're a failure or anything like that. We can relate. :)
Great post.  This is a good sub. 
It's very powerful and positive for sure. Going through some rough times currently and it's my go-to this week when my head starts getting the best of me.
I give SD the credit for my 131 days!  Love it here
