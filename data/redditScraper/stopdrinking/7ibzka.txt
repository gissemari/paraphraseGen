I made my first meal. I was surviving off of a dr pepper and hersheys every morning. Coffee. Maybe pizza or pho once a week...My meds are finally starting to work. (I'm bipolar)...I read before bed. ..I got glasses after driving illegally in the dark for 6 months. ..I take my dog on walks...This is the first week. I still need to quit smoking weed. And I know it's probably in my head I know that there will be struggles later on but already I feel like I'm a functional person. I'd chalk most of it up to my meds FINALLY working after 6 months of binge drinking. I'm not great just functional--and that is a good feeling.
