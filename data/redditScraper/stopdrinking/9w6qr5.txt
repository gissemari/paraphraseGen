I don't even know if I can call today day one since I can still feel yesterday. I'm new here but I've been trying to stay sober for 6 months. I've been reading everyone's story and it helps tremendously to know that I'm not struggling alone. Thank you guys and I'm happy to not drink with you today.

Hey I'm proud of you for those six months of effort and all the days you've probably gotten - even if they're not all consecutive...We've all been there.  I tried for a year before I got past two months.  Like everything else sobriety takes practice...I hope you'll stay. :)
You will get there. Don't give up. It's a rough road but so worth it!!
Thank you guys. I'm working on it. Today wasn't my best day but today I'm surviving on Red Bull I'm going to my meeting tonight and then I'll spend tonight playing video games and enjoying life without booze. I'm not good at this but I'm trying. I've drank heavily since grad school 10 years ago and I have to get away from it.
I know what you mean I had 7 days and f'd it up this weekend. Tommorow is my day 1 again! Thought I needed it... to relax...blah blah blah! I know better than that shit! I'm in the same boat it took me a month to get that week. I'm tired of falling down personally I would like to tell you I will make it longer next time but I have to stay with 1 day at a time. I'm right behind you.
Keep going! Every day one is trying again which is something to be very proud of. IWNDWYT
