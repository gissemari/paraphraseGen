Woke up Day 4 feeling almost normal. But still kinda sick and hungover. My stomach hurts and still feels like the flu Amazing that it has taken 80 hours (and counting) to get the poison out of my body. ..I'm still not quite healed. Relapsing for 30 hours (less 6 hours sleep) so 24 rotten hours from Sunday to Monday has rocked me for 3x as long. And it's still going ..The worst part is by tonight I'll probably be recovered and once I am I'll start thinking about jumping right back even though last time was total garbage like I'm chasing a glamourized euphoric memory that doesn't even really exist.

I understand all too well how shitty detoxing feels. All I can tell you is it gets better both mentally and physically and once you see how good life can be without being controlled by booze or dealing with the physical crap that comes with it the more you want to see what life in recovery looks like. Being excited about the future is so much sweeter than being anxious about it and trying to drown it out with alcohol. Trust the journey and I will not drink with you today   
Someone else just posted about [euphoric recall](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/aqx3mf/euphoric_recall) you must have been in the same wave length
I learned about "kindling" on here.  It is real and it is very dangerous.  you can read about it here ([https://www.alcohol.org/effects/kindling-withdrawal/](https://www.alcohol.org/effects/kindling-withdrawal/))  ..But the point is each time you go through withdrawal your brain gets wired to make the next one even worse...until eventually your body is in serious danger.  ..I know from first hand experience I ended up in the hospital on day 4 of my last withdrawal with DT's.  I don't want anyone to go through that shit.  Do your best to not to "jump right back".  It's not worth it alcohol is not worth it.  Best of luck.  IWNDWYT
