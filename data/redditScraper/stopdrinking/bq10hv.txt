Hey everyone how u all doing?   I'm new here and am struggling to comment in the chats within the app.  When I join main chat I'm given a name (kiwi) and people say hi but I can't respond/talk at all. Please can anyone help?? Thanks!

When you type something and hit enter does it not show up in chat?
