Addiction is an extremely complicated disorder to treat since it can become debilitating both physically and mentally.  Today our most common treatments include rehabilitation programs twelve-step programs and a short list of medications including Naltrexone and Campral.  In Johnson's article (http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/06/AR2010080602660.html) he makes a claim referring to the 24.4% success rate of rehabilitation centers designed to help people with addiction.  Johnson also makes claims about Alcoholics Anonymous without any clinical references to his opinions.  True there is a conception that AA pushes: once an alcoholic begins to drink he or she cannot stop.  There are several reasons to use this tactic though predominantly it is that most alcoholics have made attempts to drink conservatively and have failed (Alcoholics Anonymous 1976).  Many alcoholics don't know why their approach works and therefore their pressure for a belief in a  higher power  and prayer may scare off average addicts who are seeking help.  Yet AA works on a scientific level and once that is embraced it is easier to utilize the alcoholic community to recover from addiction.  Although belief systems can be very powerful it is mainly the change of behaviours inclined altruism and newly adapted routines that helps an addict recover...Once a habit forms it creates a neurological path in the brain.  This path is broken up into three parts:  trigger   routine  and  reward  (Duhigg p.16 2012).  The more times a sequence of events is played out the easier it is for the brain to physically function that particular way thus becoming an automatic response.  These automatic responses are useful for mundane actions like backing out of the driveway as well as for learned talent such as muscle memory while playing an instrument.  The same applies to learned behaviors with negatives effects such as excessive drinking drug use overeating and poor emotional responses...Automatic responses and habits are a natural human condition most likely derived from the evolution of the human brain.  When a daily routine allows us to live our lives over a long period of time it is a natural occurrence of instinct that forces the neurological paths to develop.  The brain has evolved to make those routines instinctual.  Instincts and our drive for survival lives in our triune brain also referred to as the R-Complex or Reptilian Brain (Sagan 1977).  This is where addiction lives...The human mind is full of complexities including inherent and learned traits.  These traits impact how we think how we feel emotionally and how we react to certain situations.  As Gazzaniga states (2011)  The brain has millions of local processors making important decisions.  It is a highly specialized system with critical networks distributing throughout the 1300 grams of tissue.  There is no one boss in the brain.  You are certainly not the boss of the brain.  Have you ever succeeded in telling your brain to shut up already and go to sleep?  (p. 34).  Where religion suggests a  higher power  is in control neurology suggests that the unconscious brain is in control.  Both of these approaches gives an addict with severe control issues a way to accept that their decisions are not based on sheer willpower alone but that a stronger and more complex force is guiding them...Through trials with epileptic patients who didn't respond to medication the last resort is a dissection of the corpus callosum separating the left and right hemispheres of the brain.  Studies with these patients gave neurologists insights to how the brain speaks between its separate sections.  What they found is that much of the brain's function wasn't necessarily in contact with the prefrontal cortex also known as our consciousness (Gazzaniga 2011).  Meaning that learned behaviors and traits aren't always conscious decisions we become wired to behave a certain way.  When a  trigger  occurs in the triune brain (Reptilian Brain) it is not a conscious decision.  Further down the neurological path the  trigger  interacts with the emotional complexities of the hippocampus.  Emotional responses are also learned through habit and routine but ultimately are not conscious decisions.  Unconscious neurological mechanisms can only be changed by repetition and making positive conscious decisions when the emotions surface...Addiction stems not only from habit but the effect the drug initially gives the abuser.  Psychological complications such as depression and anxiety may have a person abusing drugs and alcohol as a form of medication.  The neurological makeup of the brain becomes dependant on an outside source and the side-effects far outweigh the advantages.  In time the user may feel an altered sense of morality due to chemical impairment and the environments in which an addict often finds himself or herself.  Morality is a psychological construct built by social interactions.  Our surroundings are part of what defines us be it a belief system that has a person weighing judgment in a  higher power  a collective of people we consider friends or our day to day habitual actions (Churchland p. 158 2011).  When addicts rely on daily group therapy they ultimately change their social circle altering their conceptions of morality and sense of self to make positive changes...Rehab is not a facility established to cure addiction it is a facility established to educate addicts.  Many patients in rehab clinics are forced into the in-patient program by family members friends or courts.  If an individual does not wish to seek help they're probably not going to find it.  Although there may be a 24.4% success rate that does not include the fact that many recovery stories include relapse.  Many addicts will relapse multiple times before they are able to harness long term sobriety.  The success rate also does not include the fact that rehab is often a first step for addicts.  Depending on their willingness and medical insurance addicts are advised to follow up rehab with halfway houses sober houses and daily group therapy...Clinical long term studies provide statistics that show time as the major solution to addiction recovery.  Many different factors are involved with addiction including genealogy habitat and behavioral health.  Despite these different factors the only thing that increases the chance of a successful recovery is time (Husson Burns Solis & Rothenberg 2013).  The standard pattern applies: begin use increase use hit  bottom  willingness to change behaviors time.  The act of changing behaviors may include relapse while also introducing new beneficial factors such as hospitals detoxes rehabs and support groups.  With these new factors there is also an introduction of recovery criteria information religious and scientific texts...It is important to remember that each case of addiction is different for each individual but when addicts are asked to list the reasons why they started to use in the first place and to list the harmful events that occurred before they decided to quit the lists are nearly identical.  The only people who can aide addicts are other addicts for their similarities create a sense of camaraderie.  Though it is impossible to help an addict recover who does not wish to be helped.  If a person is dying of any disease and refuses medical treatment that is their choice.  Given time and furthering their education about their condition will allow them understanding to make positive changes and healthy decisions.. .References..Alcoholics Anonymous. (1976). A. A.

----------immediate responses--------

Interesting read! Not to sound too much like a high school English teacher but what's the point--what's the thesis statement? Or is the paper meant to just be a survey on addiction and recovery?
&gt;The only people who can aide addicts are other addicts for their similarities create a sense of camaraderie...I disagree. I believe anyone trained in addictions and who can summon empathy can make a difference...The one addictions counselor that helped me break through was not in recovery.
