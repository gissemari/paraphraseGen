There is no policy for AA. It literally has no rules except when it does... A sponsor who feels he/she is not able to help you will do what was done here.  Sometimes.  Thing is to keep the focus on ourselves - doing what is needed to get the most out of whatever forms our program is - and yes a new sponsor is called for.....good luck stay in touch   and a quick note the sponsor/sponsee relationship is not an easy one - people don't click - others are not ready to get sober - many reasons why it does not work but then it does and it is very good.
One thing alcoholics hate is consequences. One reason Al-Anon works so well is that alcoholics are finally made to face the consequences of their drinking. Your sponsor also set up personal boundaries regarding who he will take the time to sponsor. Maybe try start with making a sincere personal amend to your sponsor and see if that leads anywhere?

Thanks for your comments.  I talked to my (former) sponsor tonight and we will stay AA friends so I will have her when I get out as that.  She explained to me that she felt she could not call me out when she suspected I was drinking and that she felt I needed someone more assertive as less "friend".  But she really wants to stay my friend so I feel so so much better.
