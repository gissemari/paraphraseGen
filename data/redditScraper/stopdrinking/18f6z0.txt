PART 1: http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/180xlq/personal_story_on_my_struggle_with_sobriety_in/[1]..PART 2: .http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/18b814/four_ounces_of_courage_part_2/....**masked people only**..I stumbled into the emergency room expecting to be given a comfortable bed to sleep on some Valium every couple of hours a routine vitals check to keep me alive and a place to puke sweat and suffer in withdrawals for an uncertain amount of time. I thought it would be just like last time. I was in search of help which really meant benzodiazepine - the drug that saves lives of withdrawing alcoholics who go into deadly convulsions and seizures. It also treats anxiety. I felt I was a life or death case. I had been there before and that's what they gave me last time. I thought they would do exactly the same thing. If I knew I'd be sitting with strangers shaking and vomiting for the next 8 hours in a waiting room I may have just left. What I didn't know helped me...I went to get assessed by a nurse who took my blood pressure.  When was your last drink?  She asked as I've been asked several dozen times in the past... 8 am.  It's hard to be completely honest with doctors when you aren't with yourself. I paused to think.  No 10 AM sorry. I'm in alcohol withdrawal. .. Alcohol withdrawal starts 24 hours after your last drink so it isn't that.  Her words confused me. Why then did I think I was shaking? Why did I feel like I was about to die?.. I may have mixed it with medication or forgot   I know I'm not supposed to do that! I'm not sure.  I searched my spotty memory for answers...She took my hand.  People do this all the time you aren't our first or our worst case. There's no shame in coming in here and seeking out help. People have mixed pills and booze in the past. Just know you're in the right place. ..After she assured me I wasn't going to die and sent me back to the waiting room...Within the large waiting room there was a small glassed in area a room labeled  Masked people only . It was small and away from the bright fluorescent lights and crowded seats of the main waiting room. I was weak and red in the face and didn't want to draw much attention to myself. There was a group of people having a conversation in there. I got to know them a bit over the next eight hours... We've been talking to each other all day.  A nice woman said in a way of introducing me to the room of impatiently waiting patients...I let go of all my shame and surrendered to wait it out.  I'm Justin and I'm an alcoholic.  I said shamelessly. They all laughed and I assumed they knew why I was there. I giggled. Smiling helped the anxiety. Laughing treated the nausea. Laughter is the best medicine. What I'd soon learn is that no one really knew why anyone was there in an emergency room just after the holidays. I'd come to think that emergency rooms are possibly the worst place a person wants to find themselves in any given day no matter the cause. I was there to seek a quick fix from impending delirium tremors and possible seizures and current anxiety about those things. I was really just afraid to eventually experience these things. I wasn't actually experiencing them so my mind's activity turned my body restless and my skin crawled as my body fidgeted. This was my worst fear the un-stoppable panic attack with physically surfacing nausea and visible symptoms. ..An interesting thing started to happen. Having a friendly conversation with these strangers was passing the time faster than sitting alone because I was in too much shock to read a book or play a videogame. We started to become more friendly and careless about the truth. We talked medications and anxiety we discussed American and Canadian healthcare and we joked about the situation and bonded in the common challenge to wait it out... Masked people only.  I said. My voice was a streaming thought process at that time.  Why does it say that? Is this room for people wearing masks? .. Yes well it's supposed to be. I don't think we follow that rule though.  The kind woman laughed...I thought for a moment completely confused.  Oh. You mean like the hospital masks doctors wear. .. Yes. What kind of mask were you thinking? .. I dunno.  I smiled.  Halloween costumes?  At that point everyone in the room laughed.  I'll be back in a Spider-Man outfit.  I went on.  Imagine A bunch of people sitting in here in costumes. Wouldn't that be great? ..I was getting worse by the hour. I knew the nausea and vomiting was coming. The nice couple offered to watch my bag if I had to run to the bathroom in a hurry which came in handy. I was back and forth several times getting sick as my empty stomach kept lurching towards my throat and my body stiffened up as I held onto the metal pole nailed to the wall over the toilet for dear life. I was so confused as to why my body psychologically launched itself into these withdrawal symptoms even though it had only been a few hours since my last drink. ..In Canada we do get billed if we call an ambulance but the catch is that you don't have to wait in the emergency room if you call one.  I have an idea.  I said to the group.  Let's all split an ambulance. Could you imagine if we called an ambulance to the emergency room?  Everyone though it was a brilliant idea...Over time one by one we were called in to see a doctor. They weren't judging me after a few hours of humanity. They watched as I struggled to drink ginger ale and tried to help me when I couldn't open a package of crackers.  Help   I'd occasionally whimper as I buried my face in my hands. They knew I wasn't asking them for anything. I was asking for help from the universe the God whose body I'd abused or anything in between. I'd believe in anything at this point just to make the suffering end....**12 hours**...I waited 8 hours to get a small dose of Valium to help with anxiety and a taxi to a Detoxification centre paid for by yours truly the Canadian government. I knew I could just take that cab anywhere but there was only one thing I had yet to try: listen to your doctor. So I did. I followed instructions...I climbed the stairs to the detox of the unknown. I was let through a locked door into a small office. There was a small chalk board on the wall that read Rock bottom is the best place to start the rest of your life. I sat down next to the addiction therapist. She evaluated my vitals and helped me take my normal dose of evening medication right away. She figured whatever I'd missed wasn't helping. I swallowed another pill hoping I was doing the right thing. Part of what they do is ask you who you are and what day it is and it can be pretty scary when you forget... What is your name? .. Justin .. How old are you? .. 25 now  .. What country are you in? .. Canada  .. What year is it? .. 2013. Happy new year!  I giggled and then coughed... Can you tell me what day it is?  She asked politely... Yeah it's   I'd lost all sense of time.  Oh god. The days are starting to blend together. Is it Monday? ..She looked at the clock.  It's still Monday yes it will be Tuesday January 8th in a couple of hours.  She looked me in the eye closely.  The whites of your eyes are very white. That's a good sign. It means your liver is functioning fine  She reassured me. Any good sign calmed me.  I know how you feel because I've been there.  She said... Really? And it gets better? .. It gets a lot better and you never ever have to feel this way again as long as you never pick up another drink. When was your last drink?  She asked... About 10 AM.  My thoughts were clearer now. The valium was starting to calm my brain down... You should be proud of yourself you made it 12 hours. That's a miracle for us alcoholics.  She must have noticed how distraught and red in the face I was so she gave me a cold damn towel to wipe my face and seek comfort.  This sometimes helps me if I'm feeling sick. .. Thank you.  I must have thanked a hundred people that day.  Simple remedies. Laughter. Breathing. Sometimes those work better than any pill. .. Yes. You already look like you're feeling better. .. I am.  I still had many questions.  How does this place work? Am I going to be detox with medication or something? .. Actually this is a rare kind of detox centre it's a non-medical detox. You're here for your own safety on your own terms. You will be here to be looked after for a couple of days before being moved to our main living area to be put on a waiting list for rehab. .. You mean you don't have Valium here? .. No we don't. .. So  How am I going to make it through the night?  I was convinced Valium was the only way to quit drinking. I was determined to get it... If the hospital gave you the dose they gave you I'm assuming that's all they thought you needed. .. But look at me. I don't know if I can  .. Yes you can.  She took my hand and looked me in the eye.  Yes you can Justin. .. Okay. I'm going to live though right?.. You will live. I've seen a lot worse than you. I've been here for years. This is the best job for an alcoholic seeing people experience bottom over and over.  She joked. .. Are you hiring?  I joked... This would be an interesting way to get a job.  She laughed... I'm glad I made to it to the job interview.  I was.  So how long have you had sober? .. Fifteen years. It's great. Things get so much better once you've realized how miserable you used to be. .. That's amazing. Congrats. I need to remember how miserable I was today how terrible I feel right now. .. I'm glad you made it. You'll be staying in our last bed in the first bedroom that window is for me to check on you guys tonight just to make sure you guys are still breathing. You'll have three roommates and they are just fantastic.  It was only later that I learned that they were crazy homeless people just looking for a meal and a place to sleep before going out and drinking again the next morning... You said I'll be here for over 2 days. See I have a flight to leave the country tomorrow night. I have to make that flight. .. Where are you going? .. Thailand. ..She sat back and thought for a second.  You have a decision to make. And the good thing about right now is that you don't have to make it right now. But you have a lot to think about in the next 12 hours. You can either choose to go out there and get on that flight or you can stay here and be lined up with all kinds of addiction help. .. But I have no one to stay with if I stay here. I'm going with my mother. She won't let me stay at home if she goes without me.  In that moment I wanted what she had to offer... You can live here. It would be a huge life change but it would mean sobriety and a good rehab and time to really work on this problem you're struggling with. ..I seriously considered it. I wanted to stay where it was safe. I couldn't imagine what would happen if I got sleep terror paralysis on an airplane. I hadn't slept in as long as I can remember and it was getting to the point that I was afraid to go to sleep. I never wanted to feel this way again. I was in it for the long haul. .. I'm just going to suggest something.  She said.  It's your choice. But tomorrow if you go back out there   based on what you've told me and your history   I'm afraid you'll eventually end up back in here with us. And this is not a place you want to be again.  I'll never forget that woman who accepted me with open arms and gave me hope at my weakest ugliest state that this could all be in the past and I could be so much better someday...That night I did a lot of thinking about throwing away an amazing opportunity to visit Asia and my best friend on the other side of the world for the sake of my sobriety. I couldn't sleep. I just lay there with my eyes open and then closed and when I couldn't keep them closed anymore I'd open them. ....NEXT PART: http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/18xwov/four_ounces_of_courage_part_4_crying/.
