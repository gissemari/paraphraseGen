I've been going to AA religiously but haven't been able to get a sponsor yet. I'm really on a knifes edge when it comes to relapsing. Everything has gone to hell and I'm sitting in my car clutching my one month chip while reciting the serenity prayer so I don't do something stupid. But I feel so alone. I just want a bottle of vodka but I know I have to be strong. I'm too old to be hugging myself while crying my eyes out.

Play the tape forward: what will tomorrow next week next month be like if you start drinking again? I've been there. I came as close as pouring myself a beer and pacing around my apartment in pure panic before pouring it out.  The shitty situation passed and I've had good days since then that wouldn't be possible if I started drinking again. ..Can you get on the real time chat on the sidebar? There's people there who can talk you through it.  .."There's nothing so bad that a drink can't make worse." 
can you call an AA hotline in your area?.
Reaching out to someone in person telling them what's going on would be my suggestion to eleviate the pressure. Sharing at the/a meeting...We are never too old to cry our eyes out I am human so I that's my perogative. Hang in there. Writing down all of the things that you would wish to tell a sponsor might do a lot of good as well.
I went through some knife edge moments early on I'm so grateful to have held on it got easier with time. The principles of the serenity prayer have been a rock in tough times for me as has the idea that my urges and overwhelming feelings will abate and pass...Sending you an e-hug you're in company here :)
What has gone to hell? Please stay strong. Drinking will not help. Think of how awful a hangover would be.
