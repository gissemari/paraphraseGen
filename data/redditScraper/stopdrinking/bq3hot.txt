Hi everyone been slowly cutting down for about a year but have recently decided to stop for good. I found cutting back just kept the door open and was regularly slipping back into daily drinking then into copious daily drinking. I've been going to some meetings which has helped. But today I woke up after a few hours sleep and everything was making me agitated I caught my mood and tried calming myself by listing things I'm thankful for in my head. It helped but now it's Saturday night and I don't know what to do and I'm struggling a bit. I keep telling myself that the only thing that's different is I'm sober but as someone with BPD I really struggle with impulse control. So yeah hard night... and I guess this post is just to distract myself a bit...TLDR: rough night tonight.
