Hey everyone. Back to day 1. I first posted around a week ago and have been coming here for support (thank you!). I didn't get drunk this weekend but I did drink both Sat and Sunday night. Last night I had three glasses of wine which isn't terrible but it was stupid not necessary and I need to get to the point where I don't do this. I want to get healthy...I find myself thinking about where/how/with who I'm going to drink with once I'm off work. I know many of you have struggled with this from reading your posts so I know I need to  white knuckle  it. My brain will be like oh just get a bottle of wine have just a glass or two. When obviously that isn't what happens. So I'm struggling with this but I am getting better at it. The other thing is the sweating. I play a lot of tennis and I sweat WAY more than everyone else. Is this because of the drinking? I mean I don't drink before I play or anything like that but I'm wondering if the heavy sweating is because I drink so much (as in I have been drinking almost every night few glasses of wine sometimes more for the past few years)? Anyone had any similar experience with this? I'm talking a lot of sweating. ..Thanks for reading and thank you for your support. I'm not going to drink today. Playing tennis right after work. I can do this..

I've always been a super sweaty person even when I was young and in great shape. ..Alcohol makes my sweat smell FOUL though. That's the difference I've noticed with drinking/not drinking and sweat. ..I remember a whole year of going a few days relapsing. Going a whole week! relapsing. Almost making it to a month! relapsing. ..Shit even after 7 months I was deluded enough in my own addicted brain to have a drink on my birthday - which is why I'm now back down to 14 days. ..There are things that can ease the white knuckling. ..People seemed to like this post and I'm too lazy to format another similar post https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3q5ecg/that_doom_feeling_88_hours_and_on_day_4/cwc8hoa .
When I was drinking sweat used to pour off of me all day. I would get soaked reaching for my coffee. Clicking a mouse too hard made sweat drip off me. I also used to have horrible night sweats that would soak the sheets. Stopping the alcohol has pretty much turned this around so I now sweat only when I do vigorous exercise.
