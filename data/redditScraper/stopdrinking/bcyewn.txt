I'm using this little app called Nomo to count my days.  Otherwise I would have lost count by now.  I've made 30-60-90 a hundred times before but today is day 200.  ..I'm still white knuckling it and not going to meetings.  Stinking thinking still corrupts my mind.  I read ST and the posts about relapse are meaningful to me as to why I shouldn't take the first drink again.    ..I also appreciate those with long term sobriety checking in.  Without a sponsor they are all I've got right now.  Thank you! ..I was recently fired and today I'm packing my things because I have to move out of the company sponsored housing.  So things aren't all wonderful just because I stopped drinking and dealing with emotions and finances is tough.  Hopefully I'll be back with another positive post even though I find it hard to be positive.  The only thing I can do is not drink today so IWNDWYT.

Do you have any sober friends you can call?  Sounds like you have a lot of hard things happening and I'm sorry you have so much on your plate. I know my sober friends help me get through tough stuff all time. I can't stay sober all by myself it takes a village of other drunks.  I appreciate your honesty sobriety isn't all unicorns and rainbows but I do know that nothing gets better if I take a drink.  IWNDWYT
Try the 12 steps and see what happens. I can promise you that if you give it your best shot and really do the deal you will no longer be white knuckling. What do you have to lose?
