I've been toying with my diet as there's something that doesn't agree with me and I think I've narrowed it down to onions. What's this have to do with booze? Aside from the diarrhea it's killed my motivation since I can't really eat a whole lot right now I'm bundled up on the couch and to combat the discomfort I've been smoking weed all day...Weed is something I'll usually smoke before bed strictly as a sleep aid. Occasionally if the anxiety is out of control I'll spend the day baked but those days are few and far between now. This is really the first time I'm using it for pain it's just unfortunate that the high has to come with it because I've never been a huge fan...So today is a different kind of self inflicted write off related solely to my diet and not because I drank too much. Aside from today it's day 35 and going strong

Hang in there.
Before I quit drinking I found out I was gluten intolerant. I cut beer (and other gluten products for that matter) and that made a huge difference in how I felt physically. After I quit drinking I felt even better physically. Onions though? I love them :) Diet is definitely important take good care. Try not to let weed take the place of alcohol. I did it the other way and replaced weed with booze.
