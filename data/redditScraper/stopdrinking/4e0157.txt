Good for you! Grab yourself a badge and come back early and often.
Welcome! Substitutions and distractions have been useful for me in fighting cravings - I stocked up with sparkling water that I could divert my cravings to. I like to make sure I'm not hungry so I'll prepare a meal or snack if that's the case. Ir I'll just immerse myself in an activity ...From the experiences I've read here and from what I know of my former relationship with alcohol I don't believe any length of sober time will reverse my problem: if I were to return to drinking alcohol'd get its claws in just as deeply again: if not inmediately then in due course. I did decide to drink again a couple of times early on but steered myself from the brink like you did - I'm so grateful I did! It took me months to really start to appreciate being sober and also to really unpick some of the faulty irrational thoughts I used to have about alcohol and replace it with better thinking...Nice one!
Good save...and you'll feel great in the morning!
Nice one. I wouldn't say your 3 weeks experience was for nothing. ..I often like this part of the definition of recovery:  ..*the action or process of regaining possession or control of something stolen or lost.*..While it doesn't give me an excuse to drink again it does remind me that there will be bumps in the road maybe even some dirt track where I get a flat tire and have to pull over and change that tire... maybe have to ask for help from others to get my vehicle stuck out of the mud. But whatever happens I get back in that vehicle and keep driving forward and make sure it's the best damn journey I've ever had.
