As a metalhead 666 days sober is a time of celebration!  Some may not be aware but the metal subculture has deep roots in plenty of booze filled raging.  Luckily for me I'm more a fan of the music (which has helped me tremendously).  When I doubt myself and/or am feeling depressed I can always crank the shit out of some metal and those feelings will disappear.  I give you a song by French Canadian band Quo Vadis..____.Open your eyes break the cycle...Open your eyes open your mind...Hours turn into days of endless struggle...On the road to nowhere...What was once clear now a distant shadow...Why effort alone is not enough to stop the tide from washing you away... ..Life goes on...____.Quo Vadis - [Break the Cycle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgqJj2DiS9s)

Congrats on the 666 days! I shall blast some metal in your honor (though I probably would have blasted some metal anyways)!
This is an awesome day to commemorate!.In honor of your accomplishment I will quote the venerable Manowar..."If I should fall in battle my brothers who fight by my side.Gather my horse and weapons tell my family how I died.Until then I will be strong I will fight for all that is real.All who stand in my way will die by steel!"..:) Good work man..
Metal as fuck!
Oh man. I used to listen to tons of metal. Now I feel nostalgic. I still love the music but i rarely have an opportunity to listen to it anymore. Much less go to an actual concert...Congrats on 666 days of sobriety and keep on cranking the metal!
Tomorrow Im 777.
HEY!!!  Sober friend! I was commenting on this today though not such a metal head.  Happy to see I have someone here that made the same decision at the same time.  It has been sad to see the numbers dwindle of those who got sober at the same time but exciting and renews my energy to see your post.  Keep on keeping on man!
Congrats that is totally metal. I will have 666 days on February 19!
I never really listened to any metal music before but this quote is really resonating with me right now.  Thanks for sharing and congrats on 666 days!!

Rock on brother!

Tool - Sober has taken on a whole new meaning for me since I stopped drinking/started making healthier choices....I am just a worthless liar...I am just an imbecile...I will only complicate you...Trust in me and fall as well...I will find a center in you...I will chew it up and leave..I will work to elevate you..Just enough to bring you down...I'm OK alcohol is OK but together we definitely are not OK.
Here's my dream theater sobriety playlist for you dude. Sorry it's not heavier but it's cool hearing about Mike Portnoy's recovery. ..http://open.spotify.com/user/1262272514/playlist/2cVeRn0mJj41ZeAQ5WZBqH
