Congrats on getting sober.  Best move I ever made...Do not... I repeat DO NOT... follow medical advice from unqualified people.  Ever.  For any reason...My personal reaction to this story is that this so-called sponsor is someone who needs to be avoided.  I could go on and on about why but it would all be redundant.  She sounds dangerous.  If you were a friend of mine coming to me for help I would tell you to run far away right now. ..AA has some good people in it.  It also has some lunatics.  I'm afraid you might have gotten unlucky here....  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|31|3|sgreenha|*I think I'm ready to admit my alcohol dependency.

Trust me on this nothing that you can imagine in terms of getting your wife help is more disruptive than a wife and mother who is an active alcoholic.  Her life your life and the life of your 5 year old will only get worse if she does not get help...Nothing in your post suggests that your wife has made a real good faith attempt to deal with her alcoholism. Taking some medication for a few weeks and going to 2 AA meetings is half-assed.  The jails hospitals and cemeteries are full of alcoholics who went to a handful of meetings and decided the meetings were full of losers and who have made half-assed attempts at sobriety.  That is exactly how I thought when I first started sobriety.  How could I a highly educated professional who has never had a problem with the law and who makes more money than all of the people in the room combined be like these losers?  It just made no sense.  I was very very wrong.  I needed to be with those people and I needed to check my massive ego at the door in order to get better.  These "losers" the people who actually achieved sobriety and turned their lives around were far stronger smarter and more successful than I ever could be!  ..My one bit of advice for you is to check out alanon meetings.  You may not believe it but there is no doubt that your history and living with your wife has adversely affected you.  The more you understand about yourself and this disease the easier it will be to help your wife.  Ultimately however you are powerless over her addiction.  Trust me when I tell you this:  You have no power over another person's addiction!  You may think you do but you don't.  If someone is going to conquer his/her own addiction he/she has to be the one to do it...My wife was just like you.  She did not drink and she put up with me for years.  All my lies rationalizations and false promises.  Every time the subject came up I would cite to our lavish lifestyle home cars country club and explain that I could not possibly be an alcoholic.  She tried her best but she could do nothing.  Fortunately she was still there for me when I finally hit my bottom and wanted to kill myself.  I was very very lucky.  Good luck to you and your wife!..Finally one last thing about will power.  Alcoholism has nothing to do with will power.  I know plenty of alcoholics who have amazing will power in many aspects of their lives yet they are completely powerless over alcohol.  It has been my experience that looking at a person whom you love with an active addiction and categorizing his/her problem as one of will power is doing a huge disservice to that person....  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|26|2|coolcrosby|*Well I did it flushed 73 days down the drain.* by AugustWest2012|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/20ibxg/well_i_did_it_flushed_73_days_down_the_drain/cg3hzki)|.OK so you begin again.
