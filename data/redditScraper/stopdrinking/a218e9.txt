Had a rough day nothing majorly wrong in my life but still getting used to the idea of dealing with emotions and situations through conscious  awareness instead of my usual path of soaking myself in booze. ..The craving came late in the day distinctively as they are. I could see myself grabbing a 40 at the gas station (strange I crave the cheap stuff) and going up a nearby mountain and slamming it to freedom. Anything to get me away from my thoughts and realty. This I've discovered is a mental path I tend toward that has fed into my alcoholism. Years of drinking heavily to avoid problems enhance situations and to get through the day. The entirety of sobriety is often better than its parts those pockets in the day when alcohol was best still lend to my thoughts as a desire for that release. The big picture of my drunken life as I try to hold in my memories in these times were years spent in an irresponsible painful haze (why did I drive? How can I perform at work? How much did I spend? Why did I say that?) of shame and a longing for a return to sobriety. The idea of sobriety made me giddy as a drunk; I was ready for years but never until recently ready to face the trials of a sober life. I've scratched the surface of sobriety and the benefits are many. I can't describe how much my life has improved. I encourage anyone thinking about sobriety to seek out support and take the plunge. Do it. I frequent this community and the support and advice are invaluable as well as AA and my father (29 years sober). I think the craving has subsided for the day and I hope all of you make the same choice to not drink today!
