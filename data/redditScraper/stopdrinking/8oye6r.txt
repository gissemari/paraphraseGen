What are your shit thoughts?
Yes I think the sub you are looking for is right here.  Tons of people more than willing to help you with the  shit thoughts  
They talk a lot about unwanted and intrusive thoughts on [/r/OCD/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/) 
The only thing on know of like that here on this sub is the 24/7 chat
There's IRC chat in the sidebar------&gt;
