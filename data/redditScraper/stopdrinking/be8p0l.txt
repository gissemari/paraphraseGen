I had a very vivid one last night. The blackout. The hangover. Honestly scared me it was so realistic. Made me very grateful to be sober. IWNDWYT

Wow!!! I know those can be difficult to come out of! I have them every so often after almost 2 years. Definitely makes you grateful to wake up sober... You dont have to live that life anymore :)
God I hate those. Glad it was just a dream!
