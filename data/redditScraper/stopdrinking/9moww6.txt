I was expecting a "cleaned up Hollywood pretty people" version of addiction. But I recognized a lot of my own ugly truth in both characters. Watching it felt a little bit like a trip down memory lane on a shame roller coaster. Came out of the theater feeling shaken but also really appreciative of the work I've done and the people here who have supported me through it...This song is really sticking with me. https://youtu.be/bo_efYhYU2A Leaving it here for anyone else who struggles with the void. ..PS -- Realized this sounds like some sort of sneaky promotion. It's not. More like a PSA if anyone is going into it blind. If I knew how to do spoiler text I would. Just google A Star Is Born Spoiler if you need to know..

I'm seeing it this afternoon!
Thank you for the info. I really want to see it and had a slight feeling it would be emotional. Now I am certain I will need to be in the right place to watch it.. IWNDWYT
