I'm getting a lot like 2 a week. Of course I used to get headaches from drinking. But just wondering if anyone else is struggling with migraines when getting sober.

I also get severe headaches not migraines though. But almost every day I've a hammering pain in my head which lasts for a couple of hours. This started only a few weeks ago. 
I have been getting bad headaches on and off since I stopped drinking and have had one every day for the last 5 days. I'm not sure if it's related to work stress or physiological changes resulting from not drinking though. I am just trying to ride them out avoid too much screen time do some stretches etc but they are causing a bit of disruption I must admit!
I am more aware of any aches and pains now actually. It's easy to numb it with booze I suppose and booze masked everything. Now my body is like DO SOMETHING WITH ME haha
