Hey I am on day 3 would have been a week but I relapsed....I got into a really bad argument with my bestfriend and am just having a rough day. I need encouragement I know drinking wont help and will just further my downward spiral and hold me back in life. I just need positive ways to think and people to uplift me. Thank you

YOU ARE WORTH IT!!! Do NOT under any circumstances stop believing in yourself. You are NOT alone. I am (WE ARE) here to serve YOU.
The hardest days provide the largest amount of growth when you make it through them. ..You are in control of your own life. Make the decisions you want to make and be the person you want to be. If you want to be sober. [Just Do IT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuHfVn_cfHU)

Rough days deserve pie.  Have a piece of pie today.  Pies are such a [happy food.](http://ladyscourge.deviantart.com/art/Happy-Pie-58861505)  Maybe you could invite your best friend over for pie to make up after your argument.    
You can do it! Just get through today. Tomorrow is a new day. When you wake up tomorrow you will be so happy that you didn't drink today.
