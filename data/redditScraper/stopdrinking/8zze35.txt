I haven't been drinking for 2 days great. But I've been thinking about drinking since then. I can't get the thought of drinking alcohol out of my mind. I can barely keep myself under control. ..I don't want to think about drinking. I want to think about something else. Please help me

Get out and do stuff. I just cleaned my fridge. I like listening to comedy on pandora too. Do you like to cook? .I'm on day two as well. I just am a sweaty mess. 
YouTube or read "This Naked Mind" by Annie Grace - it helped me so much.  I can pretty much guarantee it will give you lots to think about!! and it won't be wanting a drink I bet ;)  Stay strong IWNDWYT
just having an orange ice lolly .weird but it helps me.
Ice cream! That helps me. Have had some every day for the past 7 days! Hugs. 
Something that helped me a lot was thinking of Not Drinking as much as I could...for me that meant AA meetings [every.day](https://every.day) podcasts exercising coming to this sub hourly.....Some of my favorites are...and I probably would have never listened to Joe Rogan before but turns out he brings on a lot of people and discuss recovery in an interesting way.....[Joe Rogan and Russell Brand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZPH6r_ZDvM)..[Joe and Steve O](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16J-lCSSMVA)..So many more just a few I liked a lot. Come back as often as you need help we here for you bud. 
I'm on day 10 trust me friend it does get easier hang in there x
