I have the weekend off just moved to a new town and my 2 friends are busy. What I've been doing is waking up cleaning and getting blasted by 2pm. I used to do art I'm making an effort to go hiking since it's nice out. Booze was my time killer. I have a self confidence gap for my artistic expression. I could go to my parents for the weekend but that is also not facing this head on. Even today on day 2 as I'm planning on going for a bike ride the 3 beers and shot of Whiskey left in the freezer call my name. Longest I've gone without is 5 days. My health insurance isn't in effect and I just started a new job so inpatient isn't an option. I learned one of my coworkers is a recovered alcoholic but I'm not sure about approaching him for advice. I'm a 20 something female in a 40 something male workplace so I'm about the age of everyone's kids..Being a truck driver I'm concerned about the stigma of being an alcoholic which I'm sure I am considering I have very little ability to control my intake. I quit cigarettes about a year ago with a 1 pack relapse 2 months ago. I smoked pot until January and haven't since then. Drinking was my last "rebellious" vice. Being a functional alcoholic brought me pride because I could get through the day without anyone noticing me...for awhile. Eventually my mom and siblings caught on but we didn't talk about it. .I replace my evening drink with sleepy time tea which helps with the insomnia. However add 2-4 benadryl to the mix and I sleep like a baby. I used that for when I worked overnights and know how well it works. Don't feel like becoming dependent on something else. .Knowing that I've quit nicotine after a few shots I know I have it in me to quit drinking; but this substance I lie to myself and others repeatedly and make excuses for. I'm having a tougher time with that then the other two. Wish it was illegal and not available in stores. However I just need to not go into these stores and then I wouldn't buy any..Long rant feels good to get it out. Today I am going to hold myself to not drinking and will succeed. Have to drive a manual tomorrow which requires my full attention for my safety and everyone else.

I am not going to drink today either.  I hear ya on the functional part and in my line of work there is also a stigma as I am sure there is in most places.  I can relate to your post and I hope you have a great day today.  Quitting Cigs is also great.  I did that a few months ago then quite coffee (replaced with tea) the booze is the last and hardest bit for me but I am more determined than ever. Plus I discovered this place which I am committing myself to spend time at every morning mid day and evening....great to have friends like you to talk to!
Weekends were hard! For this reason I went to many AA meetings. Not only did they fill empty time but they put me in touch with others who wanted to stop drinking.
