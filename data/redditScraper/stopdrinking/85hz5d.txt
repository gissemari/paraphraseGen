My husband and I went to the seaside at the weekend (even though it was snowing).  The person we were visiting had some homemade gooseberry gin which my husband was having a glass of and I wanted a sip just to see what it tasted like...So I had a sip and I immediately regretted that there was alcohol in my mouth there wasn't even enough to swallow it but it was such a strange feeling...That night I had awful relapse dreams they were extremes of everything that could ever happen when drunk. I won't bore you with the details but it was so frightening...Sorry for the ramble but I wanted to share with people who might understand why this has had such a big effect on me.

Oh I'm sorry it gave you bad dreams.  I guess that is a good sign though.  If you had dreams of getting drunk and having a great time you might be inclined to want to drink again.  Congrats on those 77 days!  Amazing!
Oh dear! We are sober twins and I can relate to what you're saying. It would be like 'crossing a threshold' for me which is a risk I personally just don't want to take...I hadn't realised but my wife and my daughter had completely stopped cooking with alcohol without telling me. They just didn't want me to have alcohol anywhere near me...I cooked a chicken in a white wine sauce   a family favourite   that's how I found out they weren't cooking with alcohol. I have to say for me I don't mind cooking with alcohol but that's as far as it goes...Look on the bright side: It was just a tiny sip and it's obviously impacted upon you and you're still here. All wins in my book! 77 Days!
I've had some killer relapse nightmares they scare the pants off me. It's strange that somthing I used to have such excited anticipation about doing and made me feel so 'relaxed' is now the stuff of nightmares. I've read that your subconscious mind makes the decision to drink before you even know it maybe those dreams are a sign that we are retraining our subconscious to not drink I like that Idea.
I get it ! Fear can be intense and BE GLAD you felt afraid and not confident that it would "be ok" if you drank  again! .Good for you and welcome the dreams as a glimpse into the future had you gone full throttle.IWNDWYT! . 
I don't know precisely how much alcohol it takea to trigger the craving for **more** but I don't ever want to find out again!..After a battle to get sober and about 15 months of half measures I took one small beer one late afternoon after work the next afternoon it was 3 beers within **_less than a week_** I was back to a habit of 500 to 750 ml of rum per day...After some harsh &amp; kind words from several aa friends ("_If you want to keep drinking I don't give a shit otherwise call 'this' guy..._") - got my ass back to meeting chairs.  ..A relatively gentle relapse but sufficient to be the turning point.  Grateful! 
I am so incredibly proud of you for not having a full blown relapse. That one sip would have been all the justification I needed to go full blown blackout mode. "Well I already drank so I might as well just reset my badge tomorrow and have some fun."..Seriously great job for being mindful of your thoughts and feelings in that moment you should be very proud.
If I made the voluntary choice to drink I'd be pretty upset as well. Not trying to be mean there but that choice is the only defense I really have.
Eh do you even reset your badge for that? I would not.
I understand.  I was on vacation last week I was at a restaurant with a bunch of friends I ordered a tea thinking it would actually be tea and when I took a gulp out of the nice hot mug I was shocked to realize it was booze.  (Although it did explain why the "tea" was so expensive.)  It was enough to swallow.  I was so furious at myself for not looking more carefully at the menu.  The guilt ate me up for the rest of the day and I had nightmares that night about resetting my badge.  I decided not to because it was an honest accident not a lapse in judgment or giving into a craving.
Oh man. That's rough. I had an unexpected risky exposure the other day. Co-worker made bourbon balls. These chocolate nougaty things. Well she makes tons of baked goods and stuff pretty regularly and I used to cook with all types of different booze so I didn't really think about it until I bit into one. I've lived in Kentucky for 4 years and have somehow never experienced this before. Well just the taste and odor of bourbon filled my senses and I immediately had to get rid of it. Found out the hard way that bourbon balls are soaked overnight to harden and aren't cooked at all. Gah. IWNDWYT
I was offered a sample of barleywine recently. I had a sip in order to not be rude but I drew the line there. Done and done.
I've found that I can smell different drinks but if I allowed myself a sip I know I wouldn't stop there...I also fall back to my old stance about drugs when I was younger.  When presented with some new drink my thought is this.  If I try it and don't like it there was not benefit.  If I try it and do like it I can't have it which just results in negative thoughts/feelings...So to me I lose in both situations so why bother trying it.
I wouldn't beat yourself up about it it was just a sip and you did not intend to get buzzed or drunk. Of course it would be great if those cravings or urges went away entirely but that will take time IF it ever happens. I certainly wouldn't consider it a relapse seems like you were just curious as to the taste. If anything you should be proud that you had a sip and stopped there it shows strength of mind. I hope you feel better soon and be easy on yourself - I will not drink with you today!
I'm glad the experience didn't throw you off track. IWNDWYT!
I was freaked out for days after having kombucha a week and a half ago. Lesson learned for both of us: not even a little bit. It's not worth the stress or the risk.
