It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-----------------------------------------..**Struggle:** I recently tried to make amends to my best friend of 15 years and he wanted none of it he wouldn't even acknowledge me. That was hurtful...**Triumph:** Someone on this subreddit who is wiser than me said that even if the amend doesn't go how you want or expect it to you can still know you've made the best amend you could and get a kind of closure from that. I can see now this is true: although my ex-friend's response was upsetting at least now I will never have to wonder what would have happened if I had only tried.. .**General:** I've been feeling kind of down lately so I've been watching some very sophisticated and erudite things such as [animal bloopers]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQsz64OXdpY) to make myself laugh. (As the saying goes you're only young once but you can be immature forever.) My favorite moment on this video is the sound the man makes starting at about 6:20. Tell me if you got a better laugh from anything else...
----------immediate responses--------

I made it to 30 days again and this is when I slipped last time. I'm having cravings and feeling flat and exhausted all the time. Nothing makes me happy and I feel like a turd. My fianc  and son still drink around me and it's a little irritating. Blech...
Oof. Okay here goes:.**Struggle**: Went to the mountains with my family did not maintain my sobriety. ..**Triumph**: Fully recommitted to staying sober AND racked up 33 days of sobriety before making a poor life choice. Longest stretch ever. ..**General**: Caught a super fun bug while traveling and now sound like a 2-Pack-a-day smoker. May consider sexy phone talk for extra money. (/s) 
**Struggle:** I started smoking again after quitting two months ago. I've been dealing with cravings that were stressing me out and life stress on top of it and I guess I just rationalized everything. It was dumb! But I have to admit now that the monkey is back on my back I don't want to quit. At least not right away. ..**Triumph:** I got my Open Water Scuba diving certification this weekend...**General Chat:** I guess it must be playoffs for baseball or something (postseason?) and the Cubs must be in them. I live near Wrigley and there's a lot of helicopters going around outside.
**Struggle:** My sleep is still erratic and strange (though it is actual restful sleep) and I find myself caving to bad health choices more and more frequently especially as I am preparing for my upcoming exam in 3 weeks. I am also starting to feel the strange mental forces pull me back into questioning whether I should give up alcohol for good. I have a few travel dates coming up and as long as I am at home with my family not drinking is actually pretty easy. But my mind is running in circles projecting about what I will do when I'm not at home. I *know* I should keep going on this path. I *know* all that waits for me is regret and shame if I relapse. I need to get a proper perspective on this if I am going to succeed...**Triumph:** I made it to a month. I am no longer craving alcohol in the evenings. I do not constantly think about when and where to buy alcohol. I have made it through 5 full weekends with no alcohol. This is a big deal for me...**General:** I woke my oldest son up in the middle of the night a few nights ago so that he could come downstairs and make a pizza with me. We hung out chatted about stuff made a fantastic pie with sausage ground beef homemade bacon bell peppers olives and cheese. When we had finished eating I gave him a hug and asked if he was upset that I woke him up in the middle of the night and he laughed and said "Of course not." I told him to keep the pizza a secret and he did. He also ate some of the leftovers the next day. No regrets. I'm hoping that he remembers that night forever.
"Pinkie is a very loving cat" beginning around 3:40.
Day 3 working a 12 hr night shift long and boring but keeps me out of the bars
Struggle: My ex left me about a week into sobriety. I'm struggling to have closure but mainly I'm just lonely and depressed. Getting out of my house for anything but class and meetings is really tough right now...Triumph: 45 days sober and smoking a lot less cigarettes. Recently got a job as a research assistant that I was a long shot for...General: Watching a hell of a lot of Parks and Rec.
Struggle: I have been trying to get used to a CPAP machine and have struggled for 3 weeks now. 4 hours is the longest I have been aboe to wear it without waking up. I wore one 20 years ago and opted for the surgery because I didn't tolerate it well then. My neurologist prescribed seroquel to help me sleep but I had to quit taking it because I didn't like how I felt in the mornings. ..Triump: I was contemplating getting the grocery store near me to deliver groceries. The ordering process is as mentally taxing for me right now as trying to drive to the store and shop on my own. I made myself drive to the store today and shop on my own. I felt if I started getting groceries delivered it would be some kind of surrender to my disease. I was worried I would never leave the house again. I walked around the store and got myself some treats I hadn't allowed for myself in a long time tried to keep a smile the whole time and joked with the two people ringing up my groceries and bagging them. ..General: I got a referral two weeks ago to a specialist because my neurologist said my case was too complicated for her. It's been two weeks and I still haven't been able to even get an appointment. They keep telling me that the doctor has to interview me first over the phone but still haven't received a call. Patience has never been one of the things I note on a resume. ..IWNDWYT 
**Triumph:** I submitted my letter of resignation / 2 weeks notice today.  I am considering this a triumph because it means setting limits to what I will take standing up for myself and doing what I need to do to sustain a healthy and sober life...**Struggle:** I only worked this job for 3 months and I was really working as hard as I could long 10 and 11 hours days without breaks rearranging my life and trying to be everything they wanted. And all I got was yelled at and told my pay would be cut.  It's so disappointing and discouraging.  I feel freaked out to be looking for work again and in a much worse job market than a few months ago.  ..**General:**  *There's always grad school* think many an unemployed lost soul looking to postpone student loans little longer and figure out a new plan. 
Just to say that I laughed till I cried at the animal bloopers! Thanks for that! Ponylad2 came in to my bedroom to check I was okay I was laughing so much!    ..I am very juvenile.
100 days baby! Wow! IWNDWYT!
**Struggle:** My fatigue just won't let go. I know and have known for ages that I one day may be limited like I am now struggling to do everyday activities but accepting that that day is now? Oh no. Way too soon. There is so much to do...**Triumph:** Not drinking despite temptations and occasional motivational challenges!..**General:** My grand aunt passed away this summer. A decade ago she made a brilliant move: She proclaimed loud and clear that all her possessions would go to the Salvation Army. I'll get back to that. Because her will came in the mail yesterday. She left ~$25k/ 21k for the SA but she also left the same for my parents making them debt free (my dad's dream is to die without debt and she knew that) I my son and a brother got ~$6.1k/ 55k each - and my second brother got everything that's left when all is settled and done. My guesstimate on that is somewhere around $350k/ 317k. It might be more might be less but the thing is *I am honestly really happy about this.* I can't imagine anyone better at handling that inheritage and as he was the only one living in the same city he took care of her more than anyone else for the last ten years. And the Salvation Army move - they did get their share and it kept gold diggers away. None of us visited her to  earn our share  she was just our quirky old aunt. Bless her!
Struggle: I'm only on day 2 and it's midnight which is when I would have normally been a few beers in. Doing my best to take my mind off of drinking...Triumph: Got rid of the rest of the alcohol in my house!..General: Hope everyone has a good Wednesday :)
Triumph: I've made it to 33 days sober!.Struggle: The post 30 day cravings are real. I promised myself I would re-evaluate after a month and decided that not drinking for the forseeable future was something I was going to do for my mental and physical health. But getting over the initial hump and adjusting to a longer term view are two different things. So for now back to one day at a time. .General: I've been trying to take better care of my skin lately (and lose some weight and undo the damage that the past few years of alcohol abuse and binge eating have done to me). Lucky I've been able to buy some new skincare products with the money I've saved on not drinking. 
Hey Mary - *you did the right thing* ;). Hope those animal bloopers are helping!..**Struggle:**     I'm only staying at mom's 1 night each week (it's only logical since my office is 5 mins away). I know this is going to stop soon though...especially when I went home to find that her and my sister took and hid all of my shower products Bai waters papers and more. Man...these people have some *serious* f'ing problems!..**Triumph:**     Yesterday was my first day at the office. While I was under the impression that there were only 2 doctors there turns out there's an entire *team* of them! My head was spinning trying to keep up with it. The good news? 1) I survived and 2) I get all the free chiro/PT/MD/neuro/ortho/acupuncture that I want! :)..**General:**     A very dear friend here has given me the endearing nickname "Hatch". I'm hatching into this new life and as scary as it is I already see some beautiful changes...and I'm ready for more! ;)

**Struggle:** Huge fight with the girl I love. She broke my heart and I broke hers. Possibly leading towards a break-up. Feels like I've failed once again. Being the weakling I am already started smoking again. Mind constantly wonders towards a drink.  ...**Triumph:** 3 years sober. Found a good job and got my bachelor's in these 3 years (previously dropped out penniless no friends and nearly homeless due to drinking).   ...**General:** Suicidal thoughts are far and few in between. Cut out sugar started working out. Depression is at manageable levels except when at times like this. The fight goes on.
Struggle: Birthday tomorrow &amp; thoughts of getting loaded have crept in. Weird as I haven't been bothered by serious cravings since I got sober...Triumph: Posted here and responses made/allowed me to slow down and think about it a bit. I have used the idea of playing it forward several times when passing thoughts about drinking crept in. Yesterday I "Played it Forward" past the few days that a birthday bash would affect me. I thought about the possibility of it leading me back down the rabbit hole of daily abuse. I gained a valuable tool. ..General: Still finding tasty goodies out in the veggie patch. More stoked than ever for the wisdom &amp; support I find here on SD! YOU GUYS/GALS ROCK!!!  Stay strong! I will not drink with you today or on my birthday!  Peace
**Struggle:** Not used to sleeping alone. Had the soon to be ex over last night and she said the same. Weird. Still learning to be single. Miss my chat friend - cooking hasn't been the same. ..**Triumph:** House looks good. Decluttered and shining. New friends and doing different things.  Have to pick a Halloween party to go to. Soon to he ex and I are getting along well and she asked if I would still go to the Goo Goo Dolls with her in a few weeks and I said yes. ..**General:** Could use a few more laughs. Will watch your link Mary.
**Struggle:** I woke up feeling nauseous and headachey today - though luckily not because of a hangover. Guess its just a big of some kind anyway I've had to cancel some volunteering I'm doing later.    ...**Triumph:** I went to therapy again and even after one session quite a bit of my depression and self hatred seems to have lifted. I realised that while I have made some mistakes recently that some of my friends also haven't been particularly kind to me. ..I tend to try and blame everything on myself but instead have realised that while I have created some problems - I am not an evil person who was trying to cause hurt.  ..**General:** Been going to the cinema a lot recently a great love of mine that I have neglected in recent years.  ...&amp;#x200B;
Struggle: I had a really big panic attack yesterday and I'm still physically recovering from it. I'm shaking a lot and cry over the smallest/weirdest things. ..Triumph: Finally got around to making an alt account to post on this subreddit. Hi everyone! I've been sober since August 1st (July 31st was my last night of drinking) and so far I've found it easier to make a commitment to not drinking one month at a time than one day at a time. Different strokes for different folks right?..General: this month is the culmination of several big and important deadlines. Very stressful and happy that I am facing them sober. Life is hard at the moment but I know that drinking would only postpone my feelings of stress and make working on my projects harder in the long run. So I'm happy to be sober! 
[removed]
Struggle: Battling against the urge to drink in order to suppress a recent loss...Triumph: As simple and mildly pathetic as it sounds going two days without a drink...General: This is easier with my wife joining me and with the support of this and other communities. Not  easy  but easier.. .I will not drink with you today.

Struggle: I slipped the other night.  I drank safely did not drive or go to work drunk but I ordered food that I wouldn't have ordered if I was sober so wasted more money than just the booze and still woke up hungover even though I didn't drink to huge excess.  Not worth it...&amp;#x200B;..Triumph: Dealt with urge to drink last night.  Drinking leads to urges to drink.  If it's an option in my mind to deal with shit: stress boredom lonliness it haunts me.  I need to make clear that it's not an acceptable option and affirm that every day and develop new ways of dealing with all this shit...&amp;#x200B;..General: Feeling good overall.  I'm starting a new job in a month mom's house is being sold.  Lots of things happening.  I need to be present for it all.  There will be ups and downs I need to ride the wave of life.  Checking out isn't an option anymore.
Struggle:  Loneliness. I've stopped dating partially because the process keeps triggering relapses and partially because I've become clear that what I really want is to fight to get my ex-wife and mother of my children back. There's an outside chance that will happen but not anytime soon...That's a story for another day. Anyway not dating has me feeling less anxious but lonely. I don't have a ton of close friends. ..Triumph:  I didn't drink yesterday and don't plan on it today despite the loneliness and a tendency to let myself slip lately. And I feel good this morning! ..General:  It's autumn my favorite season! 
Struggle: Waiting for time to pass. My sponsor told me to wait to contact someone. I didn't I couldn't help myself. Hasn't turned out badly yet but not great either. My feelings haven't shifted to bad yet about it either. I've been eating too much sugar. Woke up this morning told myself no sugar today and then immediately got an iced latte with tons of sugar in it. =/..Triumph: I'm starting to be a lot more honest with myself about how I am feeling about situations. I have been making a lot of friends. Both things I have been really bad at in the past. ..General: I'm pretty lonely. Still. But I know it's good for me. I'm learning how being in the quiet of life doesn't have to be miserable. It's a struggle but I'm doing alright. 
Struggle:  I'm having a hard time finding joy in anything anymore.  Nothing has been sounding fun lately.  I think I really need to take some time for myself this weekend and go meditate in the woods for a bit and just recenter myself and figure out what I'm doing with my life. ..Triumph:  I've been fairly happy lately.  Weather's changing getting to be my time of year (I'm a winter person) I've got a few projects to wrap up before it's full on cold but I should be able to handle it. ..General:  I've been feeling the urge to write more lately.  I need to get back into that.  I'm on back 60 or so of a story I've been working on but I keep going long periods without working on it.  
Struggle: work has been up and down due to the weather in Houston but it'll work itself out I'm sure. Still trying to get into a routine with a newly started sobriety program this week..Triumph: 30 days y'all! Matches my longest and I know every day will be a new record :) plus I'm starting to feel like running again and enjoying it...General: Our Astros are in the playoff hunt for the World Series again and my dad and I will have a good weekend at a game then at the Texas/OU game in Dallas. Him and I have been getting along much better after I started treatment and told him about it all. 
**Triumph:** My new role at work is going well all things considered. I don't love being shuffled around but at least this lets me work a bit more at my own pace...**Struggle:** I desperately want to get out of debt even though it's to my parents and they aren't charging me any interest. ..**General:** I'm so excited for the weather to cool off! Colorful leaves and crisp air here we come!
**Struggle:** Facing financial hardship and trying to balance all aspects of life without wanting to breakdown and become numb again with that first drink..&amp;#x200B;..**Triumph:** I have made it my DUTY to maintain my sobriety and see it through. Not only for myself but my family and significant other as they all deserve someone who will love them and not put them through the emotional turmoil i have been subjecting them to for the past 2 years...&amp;#x200B;..**General:** Sobriety is an eye opener to where i really spent my time and how wasted it has been. I have been feeling rather raw and very vulnerable since stopping but i know that is because i no longer have anything to hide behind or a crutch to lean on. Day by day i **KNOW** things will get better. 
I haven't had a single drink in October! ..I haven't drank less than a bottle of wine a day for 3+ years and I finally broke that awful streak. I started having a glass of wine in the evenings after I had my second baby and then we started buying a house and my drinking accelerated. I was soon buying champagne by the case at Costco...The first night of no drinking I didn't crave. Though the second afternoon which was yesterday I texted my husband from the store that I was thinking how nice it would be to come home after my busy day and open a bottle. He told me to buy a special soft drink come home and keep myself busy. So.....I drank cherry 7 up and I played piano for 2 full hours last night normally I'm too drunk and my fingers disappoint me. ..Also I'm a noticeably better mom these past couple days. I'm not planning my afternoon around when I can pop the cork. And I'm not so lubed up that I don't care about things. ..I didn't realize how much it stressed me out to make sure I had enough wine for the evening make sure it was chilled properly and to make sure I could get all my tasks done so I could start drinking. ..Last night I had a struggle when my husband and I tucked the kids in bed because that's usually when I pour my last glass for the night. It wasn't even an obvious craving but like a habit I hadn't done such as brushing my teeth. I picked up my crochet project and just kept myself busy until we went to bed. Sleep is harder because I'm not passing out though I'm sure that will pass. ..I'm thankful I took some time to convince myself it's possible and nice not to drink.
**S:**  Cubs lost...**T:**  Really tough to stomach because it seemed like they were in first place for like half the season.  And now after 163 games eliminated in one game.....**G:**  It's supposed to be in the 80's today and that's unseasonably warm for this time a year.  I'm thinking we may set a new record temperature.
**Struggle**: Feeling like I still have mental health issues outside of alcohol maybe in part due to my alcohol abuse and my last relationship. Having difficulty establishing consistency in the choices I need to make to establish the habits I need to get where I want to be (i.e. spending more money than I have skipping the gym in the morning when I'm going alone. "Everyone wants their dream to fall in their lap but they don't want to work for it".)..**Triumph**: Successfully navigated exiting a living situation (quasi-accidentally) with drug dealers/addicts that was not helpful to my mental health am now on my own. Also scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist for next week to talk about starting a medicine or getting off a medication...**General**: Could still use a best friend in my city. I'm grateful that I have a job and that it is relatively relaxed and has a lot of opportunity for growth. I'm very lucky/fortunate in that sense. Need to give my self some patience with establishing these habits can't change everything overnight. 
**Struggle:**  I really want to succeed at my job but feel like I've got multiple levels of focus that could individually take up all of my time.  Learning better time management and maintaining focus and drive is really a challenge for me.  Also I am choosing to spend 3 months separate from my partner while living in the same house.  It is the culmination of some bad situations and feels really awkward but I need the time to focus on myself and decide if there is anything between us important enough for me to want to stay...**Triumph:**  I drew a boundary in my relationship and am sticking to it!  I am actively working on creating more effective patterns at work!  And I am about to start creating better patterns at home with the freedom I have from my relationship to just focus on myself and my goals...**General:**  I am grateful to consistently choose partners who are truly good people and who ultimately respect and support me regardless of the outcome of our relationship.  I am grateful for this sub and the reminders and inspiration I receive every time I visit.

Thanks for the animal bloopers. Couldn't stop watching and laughing! Now I am late for work!! Worth it 100%
u/sfgirlmary Was this the post?  I posted it about a month ago but it is not original.  " . . . I remembered that we really make the amends for ourselves as well as for the other person. They are under no obligation to accept the amends (and I've had that happen with a woman that used to be my best friend). But you know you have now done your best to set right what harm you caused. Every amends I made improved my sense of "being done"and of truly living a new life. I wish you well!  .
**General:** "[Walk on the Wild Side](https://youtu.be/2nzeBdM09oM)" is always good for a laugh...**Triumph:** I've been able to hang out with several friends over the past week. It's great to be able to reconnect and build on the relationships...**Struggle:** My therapist took me through a somatic visualization-style exercise. I've never done anything like that. It was intense and still I'm feeling wrung out several days later. I think that things that came up will be useful but I'll have to see.
**Struggle**: This week at work has been hell. It's only Wednesday and I can't figure out how to tolerate near-daily drama and work abuse without hitting the bottle. I'm so anxious and angry all the time that I've caused myself to develop flu-like symptoms. Part of me can't help thinking fuck it just drink. 
This is my first post here but here goes...**Struggle:** kind've feeling a lot of struggle today. I had a year of sobriety in late 2016 and started drinking again when I went through a divorce as I was getting out of the Marine corps. I've been ignoring my problems with substances since then but last night I blacked out while I was alone in my apartment. I typically don't do anything awful or stupid when I drink too much but it just makes me feel like I'm not being my best self. I missed my class and my counseling today because I felt so hungover which makes me feel like I've lost touch with the "Marine" in me that I feel enabled me to be successful in school...**Triumph: ** Even though I've been missing my classes a lot due to feeling depressed and like I just want to stay home all day I got a 94 on my calc 3 test so there's that...**General: ** I kind've feel like I'm just living in the past. It's really hard for me to make friends and I'm not exactly sure why. It's hard for me to get motivated for school which is troubling because I need to maintain a good gpa in order to transfer into the school of engineering. I have a wonderful girlfriend. I quit smoking pot recently because I was smoking it literally 100% of my time. It feels nice to not smoke pot but I just switched to drinking a lot more. I know I need to commit to quitting drinking but it's really hard to start over again. Just need to take it one day at a time I suppose...Anyway thanks for listening.
Struggle..Yesterday and today struggling with the enormity of  forever.'  It's almost like a mourning for something lost. Also struggling with some memories clearing and now I'm not self anaesthetising just what the hell I do with some of this shit.  Some of it needs processing in the sober mind whereas I was crushing and hiding stuff under a blur of drunkenness.   It'll land where it's supposed to I guess. ..Triumph ..I am 11 days sober...I look better feel better am more focussed at work don't feel like I'm in a never ending cycle of ecstasy and depression. My mood is far more even. ..I've attended 3 social events and not drunk a drop of alcohol. ..General ..Being sober doesn't take all the rubbish out your life but at least my resilience is growing and I'm able to consider situations in a more rational state of mind and not going down a spiralling tunnel of despair. ..I will not be drinking today. 
Struggle: it's so dang hard for me to fall asleep. Time to exercise during the day to help get sleepy!..Triumph: No hiccups in sober October even with several in-my-face temptations!..General: it's been so nice to wake up with a clear head and feeling good these past few days. I do still have some concern what friends/family may think when they notice I decline to drink (upcoming bachelorette party and subsequent wedding for my only sibling)
the horse at 7 minutes made me cry laughing thanks for that Mary...**Struggle:** I'm having to get used to the idea that I will soon have to distance some very old friends who know I had a drinking problem (because they used to talk shit behind my back about it) because they continually either ask me out for beers and/or mock me for being a 'goody goody etc for not drinking...**Triumph:** As I become more comfortable in my own skin I am finding it easier to let go of some of my old codependent ways like trying to please/be liked by shitty abusive 'friends'...**General:** Thinking of going to some various sobriety meetings not so much because I'm struggling but in the hopes of meeting some more like minded people.
Struggle: My partner has become distant and doesn't want to get emotionally or physically (sex and other forms of physical intimacy) intimate with me. He has never been super intimate but lately I feel like I need a little extra support which he refuses to provide for me. Consequently my self esteem and self worth has taken a huge hit to the point that I have actually been considering cheating to at least get some level of intimacy and validation. I've since decided against cheating but now I honestly dont know how much longer I can go without having my needs met and am wondering if there is someone better out there form me that doesnt have serious intimacy issues and can be more supportive. I'm having a hard time letting go though since I do still love him and hope that one day he'll change...Truimph: I started going to therapy yesterday. I have never felt so weak or vulnerable in my life. I have never been so open or honest with anyone. I have never told anyone a lot of the things I talked about with him. As painful as some of it was i really do have a lot of hope that this will help me work through some of my own issues with depression anxiety self worth and feelings of worthlessness...General: work has gotten really dull and slow lately. Any ideas on what to do to goof around qnd pass the time quicker?

Struggle: my sleep is horrible at the moment I have a long history of insomnia I'd always have a drink before bed to calm my mind down to sleep a little. I find myself spending like 12 hours in bed just to get a little sleep waking up extremely sore. My week has been pretty bad I'm moving out and my landlord is borderline harassing me the last thing I need is angry texts from my landlord...Triumph: I'm on my forth day of being sober. I cleaned the crap out of my house and that feels really good I think the first days are so hard because you realize what a mess your life is spiritually physically and emotionally it's draining trying fix everything at once. I know many would say to take it one day at a time and try to not take on to much but it's so hard to do that without my usual escape from responsibility's...General: I moved somethings to my new place in a different city my friend tagged along for the ride which was super cool. We checked out the local bar I had a soda then we went go karting and saw the new predator after it was god awful       but it was liberating having such a fun day sober!
Struggle: My coworker was let go boss is retiring have a new boss blah blah blah work stuff. Always. ..Triumph: Going to NYC on my birthday with my pregnant sister-in-law. First sober trip ever as an adult and I'm genuinely looking forward to it. It helps that my SIL cant drink either. Looking forward to seeing SO many things I missed before while I was drinking...like daylight. ..General: I've been down too but I think it's the weather overcast and snowing. 
think ive figured out..&amp;#x200B;
Struggle: Not used to dating yet. Trying to work up the courage to break up with someone...Triumph: Finally got around to applying  for several jobs today.  Feeling motivated and am eager to break the cycle of poverty...General: Still learning my new personality. Getting used to being the "morning guy" at my office or the "health nut". 
I will not be drinking with you today and I will never drink again and I will never change my mind. .
