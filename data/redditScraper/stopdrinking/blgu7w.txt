Hey all. Yesterday I celebrated my  3 years without any booze. Without the help of this group I don't think I could have made it this far. It's amazing to me where I was 3 years ago. My intake was at least a bottle of vodka per day. I was a total mess with no real end in sight. Many relapses and many horrible  decisions on booze. That is all in the past but I still only focus on today. If you are new here please know you are are not alone. Day by day things do get easier. Feelings of guilt and shame get replaced with feelings of  gratitude and love. Words could never express the feelings I don't have for this group. You all saved my life from certain death thank you!!! .Alta.

Nice work!!   
Far out. That's so wonderful to hear. Hey I just woke up after not drinking last night for the first time after a horrible relapse. I wanted to find a post about a long period of sobriety to get an idea of what my life could be like and I'm going to use yours as my daily motivation. Thanks for sharing and massive massive congratulations x
