I've been having drinking dreams several times a week since I stopped and it's exhausting in a way even though it's not real. Last night was the first time I've had a dream that I turned down alcohol. "I don't drink." Then I woke up to realize I'd hit 90 days. I still have a lot of work ahead of me but I feel like sobriety is becoming part of who I am and less of a daily struggle. ..EDIT: I wrote the above shortly after 5:00 am so I forgot a few key things: to everyone in this subreddit thank you. I found /r/stopdrinking by clicking on "random" one day months before I ever stopped but lurking occasionally and reading your stories made me realize that stopping doesn't mean the end of the world (quite the opposite). And to those of you in a similar spot either just starting out or thinking about quitting please know that it can be done one day at a time. You've got nothing to lose. Thanks all!
