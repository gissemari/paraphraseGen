Are the words I never want to see underneath any of my posts!.. Seriously because I can't  think of doing any more than what I already do everyday so if i screw it up now...geez put a fork in me! ..I have major respect to those who come on here and request a badge reset and get right back on the horse. We all struggle and I'm  no exception. I don't know that i could get right back to sobriety even after what.I've been through. I need to value it now and forever!! .Here's to another sober weekend

I totally concur. Someone on here said "I know I have another drunk in me I don't know if I have another recovery". This scared the shit out of me. 
Well put.  Another thing to consider when the urge hits.
I like your attitude it's incredibly cautious. I think the bigger risks are the cavalier I don't need to work on self in fact I'll test self and play with fire mindset. I'll not really work on coping so when it gets hard I'm complacent or fuck-its arise relapse is a real possibility. Cuz I've been there. It was near 3 months of false starts before I put distance between me and drinking.       .Having that healthy fear tho I think that's best because it makes it harder for alchie voice to trick us.
