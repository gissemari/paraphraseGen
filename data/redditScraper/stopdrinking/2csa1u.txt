I don't really like counting but I don't know how else to provide meaning to this process that would be universally understood. ..Anyway thanks to all of you for your support in a couple of tight spots. Seeing your progress reading your struggles and just being reminded of the community when I browse by homepage... I don't know if I could have made it this far without this subreddit...Still I'm so glad I quit. My life quality is immeasurably higher in just this short amount of time. ..If you are struggling stay strong. If you've made it a year or 500 days or 15 years be proud but still stay strong. You're the people who inspire me and keep me humble.

Bravo for 6 months!
Awesome!
Lots of great milestones this morning on SD--and there is none more important than evidence--a real power of example that you can stop drinking for 6 months.
I'm only at a week now but already feel like a new being!
Today is day 17 for me but looking forward to improving the quality of my life even more like you have in your six months!  Congrats!!
Congrats on 6 months!!  And thank you for your wide-spectrum encouragement - I'll never turn that down from anyone on this journey. :)
Congratulations... thanks for posting and giving us all hope that we can get to where you are someday!
Fantastic!
