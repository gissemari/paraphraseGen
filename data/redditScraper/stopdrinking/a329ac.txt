I've cared little enough about myself my health and my loved ones that I have been digging a hole of debt and risk homelessness if I don't stop drinking. I am finally going to try starting today. Good luck to everyone else with your struggles and I just wanted to share

I've been down the same path. If you start taking small daily steps towards a better life you'll be surprised where you can end up in not a huge amount of time...Materially I've gone from 100K in debt and 4 months behind on rent to owning my own home in just 1500 days. Emotionally I am not even in the same galaxy that I was before. ..Like you I just started with a decision to stop digging. You can do this even if your problems seem insurmountable right now.
