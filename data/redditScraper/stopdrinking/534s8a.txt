Came here to ask what people do to unwind after their workweek. I don't get a rush from sugary foods so something like ice cream wouldn't do much...also I'm pretty broke so the spa or a massage is out of the question. I'm on the last hour of a three hour meeting and I already want to get out of here and have a drink......Struggling a little right now.

I'm going to have my kid drop me off halfway home from school and then run the rest of the way home about 4 miles. Then I'll go fight with the wife maybe. Either way no drinking.
Alright decided I'm going to go to the store and get some La Croix (or at least I think that's what it's called) wash my car then get a bean and cheese burrito from my favorite hole-in-the-wall Mexican place. I'm not drinking today!!! 
I love to take baths read watch Netflix. 
Nice! Drinking a LaCroix now.
I bike run or workout to exhaustion.  Eat good food.  Family.  AA. Movie.  Read.  My list is endless without alcohol slowing me down.
