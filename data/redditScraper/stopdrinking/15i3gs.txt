I'm writing this from a hospital room that I've been in for the last 2 weeks or so. I started getting nosebleeds that got progressively worse. I was on my way to rehab to the point where I had all my bags packed and was ready to leave in the morning. Then I get the worst nosebleed imaginable. It goes on for 2 1/2 hours gushing. I go through a box of tampons trying to staunch the flow of blood. Needless to say they didn't like my showing up at the E.R. bleeding on everything and quickly sally me to a bed. They run blood tests and immediately admit me. I stay in the observation unit and they find out all my electrolytes are completely out of whack and  have leukocytosis. I get pumped full and flushed of fluids for what seems like forever only once speaking to an actual doctor. During this time my skin changes the color of "Data" from TNG the end season episodes where the color is just off by a mile. Finally yesterday they tell me I have Alcoholic Hepatitis. My uneducated imagination goes rampant and I start thinking like I'm contagious like I have AIDS. Well I'm not contagious but in a lot of ways it's worse.I was told that didn't seem serious about wanting to get better because I don't want to go into a full-time live-in facility. With the ones I have available I can't keep going to college which is the thing that has kept me sane for 3 years now. I was also told I would have to be in some sort of program to be eligible for a transplant which if I don't receive I will more than likely die within a year. I'm not exactly an atheist but I loathe 12 step and group therapy because it reminds me of drink. If I think about it I want to do it. I have successfully gone years without drinking after detox. This time there is no relapse option this time but the doctor despite being a presumptive prick has no idea of that. I'm not willing to die I've got a great girlfriend a nice-ish place some cats awesome friends who don't drink. I guess I have to find some sort of outpatient alternative and hope the local medical program will accept it. Thanks for listening to me rant..**TL;DR: If I drink again I die.**

What do you think the AAers are doing successfully?  In my opinion they have sober friends and are taking action to keep themselves sober...I'll be honest your story is pretty disturbing and it's hard to reply to this.  Whatever path you choose you get sober because you want to.  It all depends on how bad you want it...Someone clued me in to a little trick:  I went to some treatment or other years back and it made me want a drink.  Now I can look back at that and realize that was my way of proving that treatment was impossible for me that I was more special and that treatment didn't work.  It was I didn't want it to work...I went back to AA this last time in pretty dire straits but I wanted it to work.  I wanted to know what AAers were doing that made them successful... and I found what works for me a group and a program...If I'd just said it was a decision and didn't take any steps to reinforce that decision I doubt it would have worked...Why are you fighting the idea of treatment... of being "in a program"?
Denial is not just a river in Africa. I'd get to a meeting ASAP! Sure sved my sorry butt. Do the work and it works.
It sounds to me like you should do whatever they need to see you do to qualify you for the transplant. I appreciate not wanting to go into inpatient treatment - who does? Not many. However doctors and hospitals do not like the idea of to be blunt wasting a transplant liver on an alcoholic and they need to see a serious commitment to sobriety from a patient before they go ahead with that surgery. There's not going to be any college any nice apartments any girlfriends any cats when you are dead or hospitalized full-time due to failing organs. ..I understand that your intention is to try to get them to accept your participation in outpatient treatment as adequate qualification for transplant but it sounds like they are pretty leery of that idea and you may need to make a hard choice here. ..Best wishes to you and I hope that you are able to recover your health and sobriety.
I was extremely good at rationalization denial and why I am different and so special I needed to re invent treatment just for me.  So I know what I am talking about here..AA reminds you of a drink because your alcoholism is focused on a drink you can choose to focus on recovery. Or die. .AA is not the only way but between nice bass and me there are 50 years of recovery we have seen your type before.  We have seen some of them die.  And even if AA is just another addiction ( I do not agree) it will not kill you.  Stay stubborn and die become teachable and live?  .Sorry to be so blunt but this is not the time to coddle..
Um.....**Get your ass to that live-in facility and AA.**..What good is college cats and a great girlfriend if you aren't around to enjoy them?
&gt; I loathe 12 step and group therapy because it reminds me of drink. If I think about it I want to do it. ..I guess it is time to stop thinking and start working? My experience is described exactly in the Big Book on pages 84 and 85. It was hard at first but after working the steps this is just one of the promises that came true for me..."...we have ceased fighting anything or anyone-even alcohol. For by this time sanity will have returned. We will seldom be interested in liquor. If tempted we recoil from it as from a hot flame. We react sanely and normally and we will find that this has happened automatically. We will see that our new attitude toward liquor has been given us without any thought or effort on our part. It just comes! That is the miracle of it. We are not fighting it neither are we avoiding temptation. We feel as though we had been placed in a position of neutrality-safe and protected. We have not even sworn off. Instead the problem has been removed. It does not exist for us. We are neither cocky nor are we afraid. That is our experience. That is how we react so long as we keep in fit spiritual condition."..You can do this IF you pursue your sobriety with half of the time effort and enthusiasm you pursued alcohol.
&gt;  I'm not exactly an atheist but I loathe 12 step and group therapy because it reminds me of drink. ..Is it because of the drunkalogs or just in general any discussion of alcohol?   Groups like SMART have group meetings but they do not do the 'drunkalog' thing instead discussing things like positive and negatives cravings and a toolkit etc so you can work through your addiction.  But you cant just 'ignore' alcohol and hope for the best.
