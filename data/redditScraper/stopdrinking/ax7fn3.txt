Hi SD it's been a while since I've posted/been here so I thought I'd give an update on how I'm doing...I'm glad to say that I am still sober and just recently passed the 3 month mark which I am still trying to get my head around as there were so many times in the past where I didn't believe I could last a week never mind 3 months...Positive  things that have happened are my mental health is a lot better..my anxiety is a lot less severe and my mood swings are far and few between. I have lost a little weight  (I think) certainly some clothes feel slightly looser...I have the odd fleeting craving for alcohol but it's extremely rare and lasts literally for a few seconds. Any other thoughts I have about alcohol is how I'm glad to be rid of it and how much better off I am without it...To any of you out there that are struggling for whatever reason hang in there it's so worth it you can get your life back..if I can do it anyone can...IWNDWYT

I sometimes feel bad not to come here and comment esp as things are going fine...I agree it is SO worth it cannot imagine going back to that life when now I have a much better memory sleep much better have more money feel healthier in general don't lose my balance etc etc.  No way would I go back though like you I see a nice bottle that would have been a wonderful evening...but NOTHING is so good as having a better life.  
Congrats on the 90 days!
