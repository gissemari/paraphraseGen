Woken up with a really bad hangover struggling to get out of bed because I feel quite sick....then I realised I haven't been drinking...The fake morning hangovers suck!

Hahah I love them ! Well not really but I feel so good when I realize it's not a hangover. 
Haha I felt like that this morning. I'm blaming the fact that it's Monday morning :p
