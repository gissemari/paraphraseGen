  I almost caved tonight. Not because I really wanted a drink but I feel like I'm scared to drink. I'm also not sure I'm willing to commit to not drinking again. I basically just wanted to break the streak so I almost just had permission if I wanted to. I held strong. The one day at a time really helped me tonight. I decided I can always decide tomorrow if I want to drink. Tonight I'm not drinking. Its a little scary how hard it can be with just the mental aspect to drinking.

I will join you in not drinking tonight!
I too struggle with wanting to self-sabotage so failure seems somehow in my own control.  The thing is that is something I really want to work on and remove from my life and I know I can only do it sober.  I'm glad you made it through.  I'm not drinking today walking in the footsteps of your two day lead.  Stay strong!
