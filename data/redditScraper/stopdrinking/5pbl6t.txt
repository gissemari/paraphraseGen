I'm looking for new friends and I'm struggling with AA. Thought this was a good place to ask if there were any non drinking and new buddies. ..Also I'm supposed to get a sponsor but the people in my groups look far more like they need sponsors than can help. Anyone else struggle with this aspect?..

Congrats on day 57!
Doesn't look like too many!!! Well I am in the UK and send all my support. Never been to any groups just being here helps me and knowing deep inside I need to stop drinking. I mean like really feeling it and wanting it. If i do ever go to SA I will hook up for a water.
