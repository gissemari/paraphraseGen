I'm not going to take "sips" of other people's drinks any longer. I see now that it's just been a way for me to avoid the reality that I struggle with drinking...Just wanted to post for accountability and support; I haven't been doing this for a while now but it's so hard. First-time poster so glad this community exists.

Hey good for you! It's hard to look inward really great that you're feeling strong and capable. We are all here for ya!
Glad you're here! I really appreciate your post because lately I've been rationalizing what amounts of alcohol I should be able to have. The correct answer for me is "none" but my alcoholic brain won't leave the negotiating table. I'm also glad for this community.
My best friend and I used to drink microbrews frequently. Awhile back when I was "mostly stopped" (what does that mean anyway?!) and sure enough this lack of commitment led where you would all expect: more than sips. ..I do smell some of the beers now but there's no desire to drink even a drop. I just need to remember that I don't want even a drop of poison. ..Thanks for sharing your "sip" story!
Wow I so relate to this. For the past week I've been at dinner and at a friends birthday where friends have offered me sips of their drinks. Even when attempting sobriety in the past I would always have accepted a sip of something novel but this go around I've been refusing...I think I've finally properly committed to absolute sobriety. Sounds like you're very committed too! Good for you for being honest with yourself I know it's not easy but I wish you all the best.
