I've been having a very hard time managing my emotions lately. I can't exactly pinpoint how long it's been going on but I have just been overrun with shame for several weeks. Even though I rationally know that my alcoholism is an "illness" I have a hard time not feeling like a complete loser. I'm so incredibly angry at myself for turning out the way I have. Even though I'm sober I feel like I can't make any progress and it's doing a number on my self-esteem. I've been trying to find a job for months and nothing is panning out. Thanks to a second DUI I won't be driving for a couple of years. And I am painfully lonely. I ditched all my drinking buddies when I got sober a couple years ago and I *struggled* to make new friends. I can't even express how hard I tried... It is surprisingly hard to meet people and actually do things with them without a job or transportation. I could go on and on but I don't want to give the impression that I'm having a pity party...**.Long story short I need some help with the following things:**..* Not feeling like a worthless piece of shit..* Not letting my shame and embarrassment prevent me from living my life (I don't leave my apartment anymore. I'm so ashamed of how my life is going I don't want anyone to see me.)..* Making friends..* Making my life actually matter..I'm very sure that someone is going to suggest that I go to meetings and work steps in order to resolve some of these problems. I have tried that avenue multiple times over and I've yet to make any progress with it. I don't have an issue with AA per se but I prefer to explore other options because I don't really feel like I fit in at meetings. Don't get me wrong I'm as much an alcoholic as anyone else at a meeting--I'm no better or worse than anyone else but I have consistently had a hard time connecting with people at meetings and I find it discouraging. I do however see a counselor and a psychologist and it helps...I just need some extra help right now...I need to get out of this slump and my own resources aren't enough getting the job done. I'm open to any suggestions that I haven't already tried. ...**tl;dr** I'm having a hard time coping with shame and I feel like I'm not making any progress with anything no matter how hard I try. .

You're right AA meetings and working the steps are how I got a lot of help with these issues.  Early in sobriety I combined AA meetings with counseling--the combination was tremendously helpful.  BTW there's a saying that may be applicable to your situation it certainly was applicable to my early on perception that I wasn't making progress--don't walk out of the room before the miracle happens.  In other words persistence in recovery is where you can expect progress. 
I know exactly how you feel. I've been there in the last month and a half. The shame can be debilitating. ..What's been helping me is making changes for the better. Immediate changes. When I'm too sad or ashamed or hurt I get out and walk or run. It's an activity that reminds me of my new focus on health and I feel so much better afterward...I too struggle with not locking myself away...but I think that realizing that we're all human and sometimes humans make mistakes is a blessing. I still don't have many friends and I still struggle with not feeling like a piece of shit but as long as we're sober we're building a better life.
Is it possible you're contending with depression? The feelings of worthlessness and shame and hyper - focusing on the negative could be depression. ..Once I started treating it myself I noticed about a month in that my ability to shake things off and move forward became much easier. ..As for friends it's tough making new friends later in life. That's for sure. But I remember being told once to "Be interesting". Go out and do something. Practice something. Throw yourself into something 100%. You will find yourself beginning to have things in common with new people and that's where friendships start. All of the sudden I'm really I to gardening (super left field for me). But right now it's 100% unknown territory for me has the potential to be all-consuming and it's something I can have in common people I never would have had anything to talk with prior to. ..Take all of that with a grain of salt tho. I clearly don't have my shit figured out either.
Hi..I'm sorry to hear that you are struggling.  I'm sure that this is something that many of us in the early stages of recovery have encountered...That being said remember that you are in early recovery.  126 days is a tremendous accomplishment and I don't want to take away from that but you're four months in.  Remember that this is a lifetime journey...All that being said I can share my experiences dealing with my personal feelings:..- I got myself on the right meds.  I was on a high dose of antidepressants before I stopped drinking and they really started to work once I removed alcohol from my life.  Roughly 25% of people who suffer from depression (which is about 8% of the general population) also have a substance use problem so you might be one of them.  Talk to your doctor and see if he or she can provide any assistance.  Even if they don't give you medication they can provide you with resources to help...- Counselling.  I know you're doing this now.  I had a counsellor who specialized in addictions and she helped me immensely.  We didnt' really do CBT which is the go to for addictions but we did a tremendous amount of work on how I felt about myself.  It really took two years for that work to come to fruition and even still its a work in progress...- Groups.  I didn't go to AA.  I did go to a process group through the same organization that provided me with my counsellor.  Every week we met and talked about the week that past.  We dove into personal issues provided each other with feedback and really helped each other grow.  Where I found this type of group helped was the feedback portion as others shared their experiences and insights to me and I could do the same.  I found this to be tremendously helpful...- Mindfulness.  I do a lot of this now.  It's a variant of meditation just practicing being in the moment.  You push out the worries of the day and just focus on the here and now.  There are a ton of apps that focus on this...You're four months in and you're doing really well!  A lot of what you have mentioned as areas where you need help take time.  I still hate myself and I'm three years in.  I hate myself LESS now than when I started but it's a long road.  It took me 2 years before I made new friends.  It took me months before I actually left my house for something other than work (I work from home and visit clients) and counselling...Keep up the good work and I hope you find the help you're looking for
