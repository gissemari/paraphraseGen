Following this dream I badly feel like relapsing -- things have been crap in the last few days...Alcohol has been heavy on my mind today.

The dream will fade and you'll feel amazing for not giving into it. Stay strong friend! 
these dreams are pretty frequent for me. i keep having to remind myself they aren't real.
Reconditioning our brains is an uncomfortable process. Here's hoping you find the strength to resist. When I first read This Naked Mind I did a lot of highlighting of the passages that applied to me. When I feel like this I find that I feel better after I spend some time looking through them again. Looking through my past SD posts and journal entries also helps me stay committed. I also try to remember that feelings are just temporary. Sending you strength and good will!
I dreamed I could fly and felt great. Not about to jump off a cliff today to see if dreams really do come true.
I'm sorry that you're having a rough couple days. When things are like that for me I try to think how much worse those crappy days would be if I had a headache nausea disappointment and embarrassment at the same time. That helps me choose ice cream instead of wine :)
Sometimes dreams romanticize things showing you only the good and leaving out the bad.
