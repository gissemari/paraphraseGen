I am a mess right now. I feel haunted by my past a life full of trouble and dishonesty with a facade of decency and kindness. I know some part of me is genuinely remorseful for all the damage I've caused others though. I want to feed that part of me and starve the rest. I am tired of feeling like two different people one around people and one when no one is around. Suicide has become a recurring thought but I'm honestly afraid of ruining my family forever by taking my own life. My nephew is almost 3 and would wonder about me one day everyone else would just blame themselves for every little thing until they die. ..Please help me by taking a few minutes of your time. I haven't struggled this much in my life in a long time maybe ever. As I get older I feel more and more hopeless every time I crash and burn and have to start over. I am tired of hurting people who love me because I can't for the life of me just be a normal and functional adult.
