What is life but trial and error? ..My badge should really read **4 days** and I will reset after I post this. ..I had almost two months of sobriety before I started drinking again. In a word I am *happier* as a sober person. ..I had a few beers out of boredom and have been drinking casually since then but even with that tiny amount of alcohol in my system I started to notice how my perspective and habits changed. The bright shiny positive effect of sobriety was overtaken by a sort of dark impending doom that I could not shake...I keep using the word "coincidence" in my mind.   ..Could it be a *coincidence* that my 50 some days of sobriety were the best days of my adult life? Days that were not marred by anxiety depression and a drinking-related guilt I cannot explain for the life of me? And could it be a *coincidence* that four short days of sobriety and a renewed commitment to abstain from alcohol has made me so much more optimistic about life?  ..Call it what you will: a journey a battle or even a struggle. All I know is that there is nothing coincidental about it. Even a couple cans of Pilsner from time to time has a dramatically negative impact on me. ..I really do not know if I am an alcoholic or if I have an alcohol dependency but I do know that I am better off without alcohol in my life. ..I love SD I missed SD and I am so grateful I found this community. ..Thanks everybody. ..I am back ..PDawgMcFly
