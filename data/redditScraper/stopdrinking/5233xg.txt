I've done this multiple times but here I am the morning of day 5 and I am finally feeling OK.  Finally had a decent night's sleep last night and have established that my gastrointestinal system actually still works (tl;dr: I took a good healthy dump).  That said I still don't feel near as good as I did when I had 8 months sober...I guess I need to do something different this time around so I am going to start with checking in here daily and going back to AA.  I also downloaded "The Naked Mind" and have started reading it...I relapsed last weekend watching football games and kept it up until Monday at noon.  As luck (or lack thereof) would have it I won a pool at the local pub and I have $100 waiting on me to pick up.  I can't go back in there so I sent a friend who knows I am stopping again.  Plus he is doing work on my roof so I owe him money anyway...So no alcohol for me today thanks.
