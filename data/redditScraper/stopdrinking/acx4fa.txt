I need to reset my badge but I'm struggling with figuring out how to do it on my phone. I guess I'm struggling with a lot of basic things. I started drinking again over the summer. I can go through a long laundry-list of all the  reasons' I started slowly drinking again. And of course the drinking hiding and reckless behavior increased. The shame of being a parent and doing such terrible things makes me hate myself. I've felt suicidal the past couple weeks. I wake up with dread and go to bed early so I can sleep and not feel the unhappiness and emptiness. ..What scares me is that I'm taking my meds exercising therapy   but if I mention to a professional anything about my reckless behavior and thoughts of not wanting to exist anymore   then I'll be committed. I can't afford to take off work and do not have anyone that can watch my daughter full-time if I'm at the psych ward. I don't know... the whole situation just really sucks. Btw I even took that DNA test to make sure I'm on the correct antidepressant and mood stabilizer. Fun stuff. I'm on the highest dosage of Tintellix and 50mg of Lamictal. I wish there was some way I could go up on my antidepressant...I've haven't been on here in awhile and I hate resetting my badge. I feel like my issues go way beyond drinking. I smoked weed everyday this week before going to work at a busy office environment. Like seriously wtf is wrong with me! I jeopardize my life with reckless drinking and to top it off I risked my job by smoking like an idiot. ..Thanks for reading this. I struggle with writing exactly how I'm feeling or having serious issues with. It's like my brain is a clusterfuck of wordlesss emotions.

Don't put it past the healthy part of your brain or the part of the brain pushing for self-preservation to do equally underhanded things to try and call attention to the internal crisis.  When I drank and smoked weed stuff wood pile up on the counters the cats' litter boxes filled up  and their water dishes got grimey.  Pretty soon the cats are on the counter pushing dishes and pots and pans off of the counter to try and get my attention.  That's how I came to see a part of myself that wasn't getting proper attention and was being forced to do more and more reckless things to try and get me to pay attention to myself.  Recklessness forgetfulness self sabotage  illness embaracing my self all ways part of me is trying to get me to pay attention to my own self neglect or self abuse. Or X ternal abuse or PTSD.
