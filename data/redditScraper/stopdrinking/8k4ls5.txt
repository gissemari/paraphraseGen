I made an ass of myself at a meeting last night. Everything I touch seems to wither. Today I'm sitting at a community clinic to see a psychiatrist. These meds that I'm on aren't helping. Whatever they prescribe I won't be able to afford. I'm 33 and I'm going to call my mother to ask her to pay for my pills. She can't just send me money because I can't be trusted. My daughter's birthday came and went and I couldn't even call her. Everyday I choke back tears that swell for no particular reason. It's happened three times since breakfast already. All of that said I'll be god-damned if I have to drink today. I'm going to bite my lip and fight for just today. After class I'm going to try to take a meeting in to a detox. I get some comfort from knowing that as bad as it looks it could be so much worse. I could be drunk. How funny it is that "I could be drunk" has gone a full 180 in intention. If any one out there is struggling like I am let us not drink together if only for today.

I had to cry a lot in the last days too. But it's human. We have feelings to deal with. I will not drink with you today!
Praying for you man. IWNDWYT
I went thru a lot of different things. Unbridled hate and resentment for every filthy person who walked the earth crushing waves of emotions I'm up I'm down ...I sort of resigned myself to watching my emotions as strange houseguest just feelings none of them representative of me just me at any moment. I hate alcohol and all it did to me and blame it for the emotions as it didn't want to let me go. Didn't want me to accept or allow help from others. Screw alcohol I'll not drink with you today and know that every day overall things get better bit by bit a little easier but my butthead friend alcohol will be out there as a reminder of a bad job and relationship that I left and am not coming back to.
