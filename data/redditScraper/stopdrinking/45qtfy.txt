Happy Sunday sobernauts!  It's another glorious non-hungover lovely "stay home day" in the ketojam household.  But in the interest of telling on myself holding myself accountable and sharing with others - I want to let you all know that I had a pretty shaky day on Friday.  And I got through it and stayed sober using a trick I learned right here on /r/stopdrinking on Day ONE of my journey...**Background and stuff:**..I spent all day Friday in the hospital.  Long story and lots of scary tests later my partner needs brain surgery.  He's had it before and it's gonna be fine - but it's stressful and scary all the same. There will be recovery time and weeks off work and just an overall change in routine.  Again it is going to be OK - but of course I worry...I went out to check the car and the spot I thought was 4 hours was 2 hours - and I missed the ticket gal by 4 minutes.  Obviously not a big deal but also one of those "oh come ON are you frigging KIDDING ME with this day so far??" moments.  ..I saw people I used to work with in the hospital - people that had to deal with me while in active addiction.  They looked less than thrilled to see me.  Not the most pleasant of moments :)..**The Temptation and the Racing Thoughts**..The tests my partner had to do required him to fast for 12 hours before the appt. and by the time he was getting ready to check out both of us were ravenous.  He had an hour before he would officially be brought down and released so he asked me to go find some sandwiches have lunch and relax on my own and meet him back at 3pm.  ..*And here's where the shaky ground starts and the problems unfold....*..* HALT - I was hungry angry (over the ticket and just generally stressed to the gills) lonely and tired.  .* I had no plan.  I went off to find sandwiches....not in the hospital but out in the city alone with my car....where all the bars are.  .* I had my phone and didn't call any sober friends.  I still struggle with reaching out with problems and feelings I have.  I would much rather help others than tell the truth on myself.  .* I started to feel "entitled."  I was already planning on how we would fight the ticket and SHAME the city over giving us a ticket while we were at the hospital bc HOW DARE THEY and RULES DON'T APPLY TO ME.  I ran 2 red lights while driving bc "don't they know what kind of day I have had??"..So with all this going on and my head full of crazy I stopped at a little restaurant/store in the city - a part of the city where we used to live actually.  And where we used to party HARD and buy drugs.  I walked through the store area - they sell some produce and lots of wine and beer and fancy packaged goods.  I spied LaCroix in the soda section and while I gave the universe a fist bump I continued to walk into the bar area...I ordered my sandwiches - one to go and one to eat in the restaurant.  Only there were no seats....except a few stools at the bar.  ..I sat at the bar and waited for my food.  The bartender asked me what I wanted to drink. I asked for club soda - she said only beer and wine at the bar unless I go to the front and purchase something in a bottle or can.  As I pondered what I was going to do I heard the words "didn't you say you've been at the hospital all day?  Have a beer girl!  ON ME."....................I thought about it.  I thought about how I was alone and no one would know.  I thought about how she was RIGHT. And it was FREE.  And I DESERVED IT.  And "what if" and "how come" and why me" and all of that BULLSHIT.  And I played the tape forward.  I know what happens when I drink.  Could I have had just one at that bar?  Probably.  Could I have kept it a secret?  Most definitely.  Liars lie.  And I am a liar.  ..But what would happen after that? I know what would happen.  I know what would happen because I have been there before a million times.  I would justify the next drink and I would drink more that time.  I would then justify the isolation that comes when I drink. And the anger and resentments. And the acting out and the irresponsibility and the general disinterest in life.  I would be off to the active addiction races again...And I would not be able to be the person I want to be today.  Because as my dear friend /u/finally_woken [says](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/43kqb8/sunday_solutions_recognizing_and_refusing_my/) **"I can have drinking OR I can have the things that matter I can't have both. I keep a hard line I keep my wall fortified I will not cross cross the line. My decision is already made - I will not drink no matter what."**..So I shook it off rolled out to the case and bought some LaCroix.  And I ate my sandwich at the bar scrolled through SD and texted a slew of sober friends and thanked the Universe for all of the awesome I have and will have as long as I stay sober.  ..And that's how I motherfucking [KILLED IT](http://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/61754330.jpg) this week SD...

This is outstanding. A great story so well written and such a victory. I hope your partner is doing better and thanks for the share.
It's hard enough having one facet of HALT going on much less every one at the same time.  I wish quick healing for your partner.  Glad you did not disappoint yourself and head back down the trail to disaster.  
Wow KJ what a day!  Sending prayers and blessing to you and your partner.  I know you'll keep it together so you're present to aid in any way you need to...Also Thanks for sharing because I could almost hear myself thinking every word you wrote if all of that had happened to me. It reminds me to keep my "tool box" in full view at all times.  Thanks again and be well my internet friend.
Wow. I am CHOKED up. Thank you!
You inspire me.  I needed to read that!!
Yaaaay!!! That is an awesome post! A fresh breath of inspiration! May your partner have a speedy recovery. 
Right on.  You are an inspiration to us all!  Scary stuff with your SO too....hugs!
Great post...great writing; thank you so much for your time as moderator. The quote from ufinalwoken is gold. You did KILL it...Iwill not drink with you today. I will have a romantic dinner with my wife minus the alcohol.  I will be 'present' will drive home safely and will sleep great!!
Good job. Anyway there was not enough booze at that bar to quench the thirst had you decided to take the beer ;-)
Nice one KJ. Can I get a "fuck yeah"?
I am so happy you played the tape forward and that you are still killing it! I hope all is well with you after all the tests etc..
Oh wow love! Good for you for not giving in to that Temptation. What an evil little son of a bitch he is isn't he? Good job on kicking his fucking ASS to the curb and staying the course! I am very proud of you and I will --fist bump-- you for being SO AWESOME!!!!!..I sure hope your partner is going to be ok too! I hope you keep us updated on that! :) Sending lots of healing vibes your way!
Firstly I hope all goes well at home for you and your SO. Secondly Great post full of raw emotion. ..I understand the mindset of "why me" when it feels like the universe is ganging up on me! I can use this frustration to justify some drinking like a mofo I did it for years... You are *amazing* to be able to recognize it in the moment so hats off to you for being such a fine example to all of us. :) 
Well done! and well written. Love the idea that "My decision is already made". One day at a time.
JHC you could sell tickets to that movie Keto! I was getting nervous for you for a minute there but all those massive defenses you've been investing in and building paid off big time--what a testimony about solution!..And if you'd just drive a little faster you wouldn't miss so many yellow lights! Take it from me--I am knowledgeable in such things. I'm an excellent driver definitely. :).
