I'm suprised I made it this far was really uncertain I would. ..I struggled around day 13 but the last few days have been so easy. I'm not resisting urges I just have no desire. ..I'm sure that won't last forever but for now I'm enjoying it.

Grats!
17 is awesome man. Hoping to get there soon myself day by day. And day 13 is my biggest fear. The last time I really tried to quit I ended up falling off the wagon spectacularly on day 13. It was the longest streak of sobriety I'd had in over four years.
