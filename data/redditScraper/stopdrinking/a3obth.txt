The best part of relapsing last night was waking up this morning and remembering why I stopped. It's going to be a long hungover day and I don't want to feel like this again.

Amazing how we continue to forget/lie to ourselves isn't it?  Good job on remembering recognizing and admitting the situation right out of the gate today. Sounds like you already have the foundation for a pretty darn solid day 1 going. Congrats on that. Now just keep remembering and build on that. I have a good feeling about your success for today and well we'll deal with tomorrow when it comes. IWNDWYT.
