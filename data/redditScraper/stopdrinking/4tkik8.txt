When I fight with myself I can't win.  There's a tension within me at times.  Part of me wants one thing and another part of me wants something else.  I clearly remember the part of me each night which after the **Xth** glass of wine would say  you know you may be having a few too many glasses of wine.  Tomorrow the best thing is to not have any wine.   Another part of me would agree  hey!  That's a really *great idea*; let's do that!  In fact **I just decided!**  Tomorrow I'm not going to have any wine!  My willpower is strong and I just decided! ..No spoiler here   I suspect that a few of you know what happens...Somehow the next evening mysteriously I would notice   . A glass of wine in my hand!  Yep.  *Wait I decided yesterday it was a good idea not to do that!*  It was a **good** decision.  I decided with **MY** willpower with my own free will.  No one made me make that decision.  Yet the decision got overridden.  ..Different parts of me were arguing.  When I thought all along it was just one  me  it wasn't.  There were different parts of me arguing.  Those with a psychological bent might say yes!  Of course!  It's your ego Id and superego.  I prefer to call the parts Larry Moe and Curly.  I was not of one mind.  I had a conflicted mind not in agreement similar to [The Three Stooges Dope Slap]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ZgVRJ-H8U).  ..I couldn't win.  No matter the outcome I couldn't win.  That's because I was fighting myself.  A couple days ago u/coolcrosby offered a great post [Learned Helplessness]( https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/4t37op/weekend_writing_learned_helplessness_woof_woof/).  In one of the comments he noted  I was the one administering the shocks .  Well that really resonated with me.  I was the one  hitting myself' like the 3 parts of the Stooges.  ..I was engaged in a dance and [Struggling with yourself is a battle you can't win]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_bUn_iIbL4&app=desktop)...That is **Exactly** why unlike any other struggle battle challenge opportunity in my life where my Willpower would carry me through in This particular instance it couldn't.  Because all the other battles such as career education finance etc. I was struggling with an external agent.  ..But with alcohol I was Struggling with Myself.  In this situation I needed help.  I needed help from others.  And when I asked for help.  When I was willing to accept help.  When I let go of my pride and ego.  Then.  Then.  Then!  It worked for me.  I didn't beat myself.  I didn't win the Struggle with myself...I walked away from the Struggle with myself and I embraced Acceptance.  From that point forward everything has been easy.  ..Peace be with you.  Just for today I don't drink with you..

Thanks for this thought it's very helpful and offers me some new perspectives! I need to set about getting some help from others as my own willpower has come up short before :)
I am finding the concept of "ego" especially as it pertains to problem drinking very interesting lately. In "Alcohol Lied to Me" the author has a discussion as to how the ego contributes to problem drinking.  Very helpful in working to catching and stopping well worn thought patterns and behaviors.  Thanks for the post!
This post summarizes my feelings on "surrender" perfectly.
Acceptance is tough for overachievers PG.  A real winner could control alcohol!  Right?  Surely a little addiction issue can't kick my ass!  Right?  Your post sums up my struggle well.  Deep down inside I have not admitted defeat.  I am smart enough to know alcohol will always beat me down but my ego and selfishness gets in the way.  The battle rages on......which is a good thing.  Thanks for the post.
