And now I have a hangover and am dealing with intense guilt. My family knows about it this time which is what I'm going to focus on. Feeling like I got hit by a Mack truck and beating myself for being so unproductive. Hoping nobody pops in for a visit before my energy returns.

Been there.  The shame and blame are One of the enemies. They are not productive and usually radically distorted.  They are almost like one of the physical pains of a hangover. Remember the pain to help decrease The likelihood of repeat.  I will join you in not drinking today.
Get back on the horse and back yourself not to fall off for 24 hours.  Then reload and repeat...You can do it.
