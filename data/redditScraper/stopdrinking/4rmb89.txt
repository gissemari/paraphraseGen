I was so tempted to ask my friend to grab a bottle of wine and drink with me but I fought the urge and hula hooped instead. I'm proud but damn it's a struggle. I'm only on day 1 of my quit date day 2 if I count yesterday which was a day I tried to find booze but couldn't...One day at a time is truly how I'll do it I suppose...Stay strong everybody <3

i send internet hugs to you friend. you won the day!.lets not drink together:)
But you did make it...And that is all that matters...Yesterday is yesterday Tomorrow hasn't happened yet...Today is all that matters and today you did not drink...You should feel proud.
You are not alone on this struggle special for us with a few days but let's stick together in order to be away of that very first drink. YOU made it today let's make a commitment for tomorrow too.
Someone else on this site said that every day when you go to bed sober without having taken that first drink is a good day no matter what else you did or didn't do. I find this is just as true for me after more than a year as it was during the first few days. Congrats on 2 days.
Well If you can hula-hoop you can do virtually anything including stop drinking!  ..I have this great image in my mind:  you're at a gathering somewhere.  Someone approaches you and offers a drink.  You say no thanks I've got this as you whip out your hoop and start workin' it!  Eyes gravitate to you.  While still hooping you toss hoops to others who drop their drinks and join you!..I'm pinging some of the mods and creative people herein and recommending that we embrace the hula hoop as the official Stop Drinking Dance.  We need a youtube with u/VictoriaElaine u/stratyturd u/nika65 u/finally_woken u/OspreySoaring u/KetoJam u/McLensky u/coolcrosby u/jet9RDO U/verabigwang u/sfgirlmary u/pupsickletoes doing "The Stop Drinking Hoop"!..It could surpass the Macarena!..I don't drink today and hoop with all fine Sobernauts!
Hey if it was tough you're obviously tougher! YOU *already* stayed strong. Excellent job. Maybe we can do that with you. :)
