Please please please seek help!!  Our states of mind are not fixed- things can and do get better.  Please do not do anything impulsive!
Unfortunately no one here is able to provide the support and help you need. You might try posting on r/suicidewatch or calling the suicide prevention hotline at (800) 273 8255. Be well.
Not many people have a linear journey. Most sober folks I know go through a relapse. You're not alone. ..If you are feeling suicidal you can call tel:1-800-273-8255 or go to suicidepreventionlifeline.org and chat with a specialist. ..You'll get through this sending you lots of love
