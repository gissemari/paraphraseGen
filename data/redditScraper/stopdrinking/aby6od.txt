I'm still struggling and have heard of this product that reduces cravings. But when I look up reviews about it they are all either 5 star raving reviews or one star horrible bashing reviews. Nothing in the middle. Some complaints were about pricing but I don't think I'd mind if the product actually worked. I'm just looking for a little help. My will power is only so strong.

I've tried something similar and it didn't do very much for me.
Personally I wouldn't go with some random woo-woo off Amazon or wherever when there are tried and tested actual medications that might actually work.....Have a browse on r/Alcoholism_Medication and talk to your doctor!..Cravings are mostly mental in any case I found the [Videos on Overcoming Cravings](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=overcoming+cravings+this+naked+mind) from 'This Naked Mind' very helpful.... ..Willpower is a finite resource and relying on it alone to stay sober tends not to be a successful long-term strategy... getting yourself the right knowledge tools and *support* makes all the difference!..Also eating something sweet and drinking gallons of fizzy water really helps to reduce cravings.... eventually the cravings go away altogether.....Best of luck with whatever you decide to do keep us posted!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
