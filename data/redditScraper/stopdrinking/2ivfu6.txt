There was a time in my life when I didn't think I could make it this long without a drink.  I was deeply depressed and was drinking on an almost daily basis.  Then one night I decided I needed to change my life for the better.  I stopped hanging out with the "friends" I surrounded myself with and started moving in a new direction away from the toxic habits and relationships I had cultivated over the last couple years.  Now here I am 90 days later a completely new person.  .So now let me tell you a little about myself.  .Without writing a long post and getting into every detail I'll share with you the basic stuff.  I am just a couple weeks away from my 21st birthday.  I just finished my legal obligations regarding an alcohol related DUI I got two years ago. I am currently a part of r/NoFap and r/pornfree to help cure my masturbation and porn addiction.  I quit smoking cigarettes and weed back in May.  I sit here now with no addictions of any kind.  A few months ago I could not have imagined being where I am now.  I was just a confused kid with nothing better to do who got caught up with the wrong crowd.  But I stood up and fixed it on my own without the support of all those who I thought were my friends.  Looking at it from the outside in I can now see how dysfunctional those people are and how they most likely will never change so I don't plan on ever letting them back in to my life.  I can also see how dysfunctional I was.  The weakness runs in my family and I was always told to be careful and just shrugged it off but now I know what that really means.  .So with this post I just wanted to share with you the struggles I've overcome in the last couple months and hope to serve as inspiration for any of you who are just beginning your journey into sobriety.  I as well as everyone else on here are here for you so feel free to let me know if you have any questions.  Thank you for reading and good luck!

Congrats Brahma.   You took on a lot of challenges at quite a young age.  And I can speak for many of us to got sober later in life we are jealous of the freedom you'll have through your 20s and 30s that I didn't have (freedom from alcohol guilt bad behavior etc)...Keep it up!
