Managed 21 days...Found a 1/4 bottle of vodka 5 days ago in the boot of my car that I had totally forgotten about. I had sorted out booze in the house and was managing it. I should have thrown it out but I did not...It was on my mind all week and this evening even after having a good day I drank it for no other reason than I wanted too...Back to square one and feeling shit about it and again losing my partners trust...F'ing hell this is hard. I used to think I drank because life was hard and unfair and today I actually had a really good day and I relapsed. ..I will not drink tomorrow....although I am scared....

I'm very new to this. Only 2 days and this is my first time trying. I also am only trying to make it to 7. I think it's awesome you made it to 21 days!

I relapsed hard at 21 days. Now I'm almost a year sober. That relapse inspired me to stay sober.  I hope you find some strength in yours. IWNDWYT
