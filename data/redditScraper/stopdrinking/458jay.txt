Hello SD. New account but that's just because I make a habit of deleting my old ones at regular intervals to try and force myself to stay away from this site (seriously it's been harder to quit than the booze!). In reality I'm a long-time lurker and sometimes-poster on this sub and I've been on the wagon for over a year and before my last relapse (which only lasted a single night thankfully) I was alcohol free for another year before that...I have a question that I suppose mostly is relevant for those among you who have been free of alcohol for longer periods of time and like me also happen to have started dieting and exercising to lose weight after that and it is this: Do you find that you have a very easy time following your diet compared to people around you who have not gone through the process of quitting alcohol?..Because I do to a pretty ridiculous degree. I have friends and family who literally can't resist a piece of cake presented to them. I have a tenant who when he tried to go on the same paleo/primal LCHF diet I follow just simply couldn't because simply the thought of going without grains (not the sugar mind you he was willing to give that up!) was too much. I have family members who struggle to walk through a store and not end up walking out with a bag full of candy and cookies...But to me those things are no problem at all and it kinda worries me in some ways. Do I actually have an eating disorder? I know that's really common in alcoholics (though I can't find any studies regarding eating disorders in former alcoholics only in people who are currently drinking)...The other alternative I can think of is that not-drinking has already forced me to give up the things I really want and lust over and that it has carried over to dieting as well. Giving up sugar and grains and eating less food in general is basically child's play in comparison to overcoming a crippling alcohol addiction is my line of thought here...So I'm wondering if this is an actual trend (again can't find any research that has studied this in *former* alcoholics only in current ones) or if it's just me...(Just to be clear: I'm asking about explicit and deliberate dieting with hard restraints and maintaining a caloric deficit and so on; I already know that just by cutting alcohol from your life you can easily lose many kilograms I know I lost almost 25 of them over a period of a few months without even trying when I first stopped drinking. But that's not really "dieting" to my mind.)

I think "struggle" is all relative to ones own position. Quitting alcohol and staying sober was extremely difficult until it wasn't. The last three years were a piece of cake..which brings me to sugar. ..I have been struggling to beat the carb monster for as many years as I have not struggled with alcohol. For me it takes about two weeks to get past intense cravings for sugar then it is easy to eat well. Then in a moment of weakness one cookie will send me back down the  rabbit hole of sugar addiction. The way I eat candy and cookies is definitely similar to the way I drank. Handful after handful of candy. Ten cookies at a time. Sneaking candy in my car hiding it from my wife. Cross addiction is definitely a common thing with alcoholics.
