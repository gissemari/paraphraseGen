I'm posting because I used to hunt through the posts on here wondering if it was possible to actually feel normal and for sobriety to not be a constant struggle...Well I am not craving it. Even if I was offered a drink right now even one of my favorite ones I wouldn't be tempted. Not because I'm 'strong enough' to say no but because the idea isn't currently appealing. ..Sometimes I have days where I miss it. Usually it's in a social context like I'm meeting a new friend and I lament that I can't just ask them out for a beer. But that's just because I'm socially lazy. That powerful pull that itch that need for booze isn't there anymore. ..But mostly I don't think about it at all. There's hope y'all. It actually truly gets better. I started my sober journey in May 2016 so my run has been long (though I relapsed lots in there the most recent was almost 9 months ago) but yeah I feel good. I feel good SOBER. I like to do things sober. I feel like me and I'm sober. I LIKE me and I'm sober. ..It's worth it. I'm healthier I'm happier I'm closer to my husband. I'm a decent mom. I'm a decent daughter. I'm becoming somebody I can be proud of. I have goals and I'm actually taking steps to complete them. I paid off my credit card...Power through y'all. ..IWNDWYT
