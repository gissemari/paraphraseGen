I have been struggling with some type of mental issue..I'm not exactly sure what is wrong though as I've seen several doctors and therapists but nothing seems to help. It feels like there is a huge empty hole where my heart should be. Nothing I do fills this emptiness. You would think by being a parent that this feeling would be non-existent but it's not.. it's there and it's eating away at my entire life. Every time I see alcohol I look at it as any  normal  person would. I don't entertain the idea of drinking as you would say an alcoholic does. It's when I am finished with my work and weekly tasks that this feeling really sets in. I begin to lose control of my thoughts and turn into a different person.. like I have a savage troll living inside of my head who wakes up when I'm supposed to be enjoying sober quality time with my family and resting up for the weekend. This thing inside my head has no interest in letting me be. It takes over my entire mentality and wants to destroy anything I have accomplished within the last week. It's not just alcohol it wants. I have so much trouble fighting it. I could outweigh the pros and cons of drinking and have 1000 reasons to not drink but this creature will make an excuse. I don't benefit at all from this relationship with this thing and to be quite honest I don't ever remember inviting it in. It's like a cancerous growth that feeds off of any potential success and happiness I may accumulate. I am losing a battle with an imaginary enemy. I would never call it my friend. They say what doesn't kill you makes you stronger but I don't feel strong. I feel so weak and tired and desperate for this monster to go away. Every time I feel I am making progress it sneaks up on me and laughs in my face telling me I'll never amount to anything and everything I do in life is pointless. Maybe my unhappiness grew a mind of its own and wants to battle me for control. I thought I was winning and I felt I was beginning to be at peace with myself. The more I fight the better I become.. the better my mistakes become. I am working toward a professional career and I'm getting pretty good at acting like a professional.. until my significant other wakes up. I know that most addiction problems root from unresolved or underlying issues with an individual. I've been working on mine for years and have actually made much progress but where do I draw the line? I wish I could set off a grenade inside my head and kill this thing once and for all. I would be willing to kill myself along with it just to stop it from ever coming back.

I can relate to this although my experience with overwhelming insecurity and anxiety is different. I am an established and well-respected professional but I have historically been waiting for the day that I'll be found out as an imposter publicly ridiculed and ousted...I have no reason to feel this way. I'm qualified and competent but sometimes the self-doubt shows its ugly face. Now that I'm sober I hardly think of it but when I was drinking? Total insecurity and anxiety...I hope this gets better for you. IWNDWYT. 
Addiction is often a comorbid disorder maybe something you use to self medicate for depression or the opposite maybe something that causes depression. Either way it might be necessary to tackle this with support from a psychiatrist or therapist.  It does sounds like you have a ton working for you as far as separating yourself from the addiction.  Now use that imagery to imagine the death of the monster imagine yourself growing stronger than the monster imagine freedom brighter and closer.  Educate yourself about addiction as much as you can read This Naked Mind.  Read anything that speaks to you about addiction.  Find an alternative to pouring your first drink identify the thing that you are trying to cope with.  Can you commit to doing this alternative for a day?  For me it's running and then having sparkling water it's being mindful in the morning to allow myself to set an intention for the stressors I expect to face during the day.  Believe in yourself know you are close to killing this monster and that although it may have served you once it no longer does so let it go.  Find a good therapist to help with possible depression and psycho education.  Find a group that might mean AA but doesn't have to maybe it's a cbt group where you get inspired about learning about ways to counter distorted and irrational thoughts.  You can do this!
