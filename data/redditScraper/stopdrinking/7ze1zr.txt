88 days I have been here once before and I hope to never be at this day again. Thanksgiving weekend ended with a 4 day bender. It was a good reminder of why I decided to join this subreddit. It also showed me that Kindling is a real thing which is pretty damn scary. Even though nothing terrible happened that weekend it will forever be etched in my head. If you have suffered from relapse don't be too hard on yourself because it is definitely possible to dust yourself off and move on. Sober on friends.

Congrats on a beautiful number!! 
Sober On!
Kindling scares me as well. This is probably my 5th or 6th time with more than 2 weeks sober and each time has taken longer to recover with increasingly bad withdrawals. ..I will sober on and not drink with you today
88? Do you have to switch your number now that you're a running back? (Packers joke sorry :p) .Congratulations and thanks for the encouraging words!
&gt;it is definitely possible to dust yourself off and move on..You're a beautiful example of this NTBTN! Congrats!!!
I had a Thanksgiving weekend bender in 2009; when I came to work late the following Monday my employer at the time threatened to fire me if I didn't do something about my drinking. I made it eight months the longest period of sobriety I had at the time. Then I went out for almost six more years. Then I got necrotizing pancreatitis. It has kept me sober ever since. It doesn't have to happen to you though! Keep coming back. I wasn't as teachable then as I am now.
Keep up the good work!.IWNDWYT
