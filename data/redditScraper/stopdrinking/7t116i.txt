Thoughts all day fearing  relapse. What if I cave? How long will this really last? Et cetera. ..It was helpful to me to just go ahead and shelve that and focus on today. Because I know I will not drink today. The day is almost done and I have already committed 100% to tomorrow. ..I have professional networking thing where folks will be drinking that I have never met in a field in which I am relatively new and I am preparing myself. I will plan to stay one hour tops. Order double tonic and limes. And have my personal introduction spiel ready so I don't feel under the gun to produce a witty story. Oh that. And asking others about themselves lots of questions so I do not become a silent introvert. ..Sweet dreams Western Hemisphere peeps. I will not drink with you. Thank you for being here for each other.

Sweet dreams.  You sound really solid to me.  Congrats on those 18 days.  Let's keep it moving.
Sounds like a good plan! I have to practice my spiel beforehand so I don't sound like a robot.
