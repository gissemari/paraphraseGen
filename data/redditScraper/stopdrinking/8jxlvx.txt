What happened?
(((hugs)))
What are you going to do differently this time?..I couldn't stay sober without lots of support. 
Removed? Come back no one judges you hereI've also relapsed following seven months we can let that define us or choose to dust ourselves off learn from it and continue.  I'm proud of where I'm at relapse n all.  It's a far cry from where I was a year ago..drinking every day and I hope you are too!
