.  Drinking has always been a part of my family my friends and my relationship with myself.  My entire extended family runs a very successful liquor business I live in a town with one of the highest bar per capita ratio and my personal work relies and encourages people to drink.  Without drinking who am I and where am I going?..At the age of 5 my father handed me my first beer.  This was for tasting and fun he had no intention of getting me drunk.  As soon as it hit my lips my eyes lit up and I sucked down the entire thing before he could grab it back.  I still remember the taste on my tongue sweet and salty like a pretzel from the gods.  Although most would have seen this as a sign the chatter continued around me and the incident was shrugged off as  kids will be kids .  As I got older drinking came and went around me.  Always in the public foreground never shamed always available and fun.  Although my house was filled I never snuck a drink without permission.  The occasional beer at dinner was allowed so I never pushed it.  When High School approached so did the parties.  I didn't have much social anxiety but whatever barriers were up drinking tore them down in a brilliant firework display.  Always pouring shots starting the dance closing down the shop it seemed I found a way to be the life of any social gathering.  I never drank outside the parties but when the party started I was there.  ..As college started so did my depression.   I dealt with it very privately and never abused alcohol to cover my emotions.  When I was happy I was out and when I wasn't I was home.  My depression comes in heavy waves but I have found ways to deal with it.  So when I wasn't feeling down I took advantage and partied as hard as I could until it disappeared days weeks or sometimes even months later.  Then I would hide away until I was able to leave my room again.  As time moved forward my bouts of depression grew longer.  However nobody knew the difference.  I worked hard and played hard and I was good company.  When college ended I moved north in pursuit of work...After settling into my new home I found my new friends and started my new life.  I had a great job and great support system.  These new friends however were older and more seasoned  Drinking to them was a daily habit.  Heavy and public was how they played and nobody judged them.  (I live in a very non-judgemental area where everybody can live and let live their own lives however they want.  Nobody is ever too drunk or too sad you will always have someone to fall down onto and help you back up.  Rock bottom here is almost non existent as no one blames you for anything.  Everybody can spare a dime everybody has a couch to sleep the women and men are plentiful and loose and everybody is beautiful.  THIS MAKES IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO REALIZE YOU HAVE A PROBLEM)  My drinking became heavier and started overlapping with my depression.  Soon I was casually drinking a bottle of tequila during my shift and a bottle after.  Then cocaine found its way into my life purely as a way to keep drinking. Coke habits can only last so long and I would rather have been drunk.  So after binging heavy everyday for 6 months and then every weekend for 4 years the coke finally stopped but the drinking never ceased.  My drink of choice wavered from tequila to whiskey to vodka usually changing teams every 6 months for no reason to my guessing.  Even though my habits were very public my social circles always supported me and my work.  All my friends and family were always sending me positive vibes so why should I change anything I do? However I was 30 years old no bank account no car and I hadn't seen the sunlight in a year and a half.  My entire paycheck went to the bottle and to the landlord.  Most of my possessions had been sold off to pay for back rent that I couldn't make up at work.  But I thought I was happy I thought this is how you live.  Struggling to lift your head above your shoulders every morning grinding just to stay hydrated enough to jerk off and go back to sleep. Drinking throughout the day just to feel normal again well after midnight.  As far as I was concerned  I was super busy with no time.  I was working so much but in reality all I was doing was drinking and sleeping.  Ordering massive amounts of chinese delivery to sit next to bed untouched until I drank enough to sip some soup.  Hangovers would last days if I didn't take care of it correctly.  Each night rolling into the next with no help for escape.  My minutes were days and my weeks were months.  I was sinking fast and enjoying it.  I used to fantasize each night when going to bed (10am) that I was pressing a cold steel revolver against my head.  The thought of the cold metal was the only thing that could bring my fever down.  Jokingly to my friends I would always say  Ill never actually kill myself because I can't afford the gun .  This was true every dollar was spent on drinking there was no time to end my life not quickly at least...I wish I could tell you it was easy I wish I could tell you I woke up sober and happy one day and started the rest of my life.  It didn't happen.  The first day truly sober felt like years passing over a scorched sky.  Desert winds breaking down my body while my mind ran wild.  Never sleeping never awake.  That first day was the hardest thing I had ever done.  Nothing compared to the pain I felt the need to end it all with a bottle.  But that first night came and went.  I wanted to scream from the roof tops  I DID IT LOOK AT ME!   I thought I deserved an award from the Mayor and a key to the city and you know what - I did deserve it!  I looked in the mirror up and down at the new person who stood there and thought  you're a different man now go forth in your new life .  ..Each day sober was a new hurdle each one with its own difficulties and rewards.  And like my drinking my new found sobriety soon started to roll over on itself.  Minutes turned to hours days to weeks    This journey is not over it has only just begun.  Each day awoken is a new day spent sober.  Each day is my new first day and each time its only easier.  ..I wish I could tell you I was missed at the bars but soon those stories continued on without me finding new main characters and new story lines.  Honestly I was out of stories I was telling the same ones over and over again.  The people and places might have changed but the characters and plot never changed.  Its time to write my new book and start this new story.  Ill never throw away the old book its full of lessons love sadness adventure anger depression - everything that makes a good story great but its not my story anymore.  Its time for a new book with new characters and a new plot. ..Its time to live my new life.  I Will Not Drink With You Today
