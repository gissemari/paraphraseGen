So I went to a pub alone... To grab some food and I sat at the bar.  I ordered my food and a Coke.  A few minutes later a regular walked in who was clearly already or maybe still drunk.  He sat down and the bartender already knew to set him up with his shot and Bud light.  I was there maybe an hour and he ran through 2 beers and 2 shots...  I couldn't finish my food...(even despite my last post lol). I couldn't sit there and watch him.  I lost my appetite.  I think I will only order takeout from there from now on. ..To all of you who may struggle through this weekend (myself included) stay strong!  I can promise that I will not drink with you today.

IWNDWYT too!
Yeah I don't eat at bars either if it's my own choice haha. Why torture myself?
I think I'm probably in the minority here but I feel way more triggered when I'm not near alcohol or other people drinking it.  Something about not drinking at a bar makes me feel very in control and then watching the behavior of the patrons slowly become unglued and imprecise and strange cements those positive feelings...I think it has to do with the fact that I tended to really like bringing booze with me where booze wasn't supposed to belong.  Movie theaters trains stoops and street corners--that kind of thing.  Being outside on a nice day has my brain screaming for a sidewalk beer but I could have a sandwich at a bar no problemo and barely give a shit. ..I'm rambling--I'm super triggered today for no reason.
