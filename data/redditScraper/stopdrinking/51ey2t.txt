Hey people :) ..I've been reading all these posts since yesterday and this looks like a great thing. People helping each other is wonderful to see. Reading is good for me but I guess participating is better and I really need some advice about what to do. ..I'm 24 years old and I've been struggling with addiction since I was about 12. In 2015 things got outta hand (actually things got outta hand all the time) but then I decided to do something about and I went for rehab to overcome my drug addiction. ..When I returned things were good for me. I was attending meetings had a sponsor I passed my admission test to start a study and got a place for myself. But I was still having problems with anxiety and depression. I found it hard to commit to work/volunteer work and couldn't handle any pressure. By the time I got pretty lonely as well because I was living in a new city where I didn't know anybody. So my addicted mind started to play. ..'These meetings these people are not like you'. .'You can moderate your drinking you're not an alcoholic.'.'24 years old and never being able to drink? F that.'..These are only a few of the thoughts I expierenced and as time passed I started to listen carefully and relapsed about a month ago. .It started with a few beers a week and pretty soon i'm drinking every single day. I went to school 1 day and then isolated myself at home with alcohol and video games. That's basically all I do now. I can't get out of this circle by myself. On days that I'm not drinking I feel completely miserable and anxious. ..I made an appointment with the rehab facility with the idea to go back again and do it right this time. Now they seem to think it's a good idea to just do individual psychotherapy about once a week. I'm really scared for the rest of the week because all I can think about is drinking gaming and escaping my actual life. I can't seem to commit to not drinking unless I go to rehab. Is that an escape as well? I really don't know what to do. ..Structure in my post is kind off gone but what the hell. I'm lost. .

Welcome friend! You have made really good decisions! I was just like you at 24 in the addition sense.  I was high and/or drunk all the time.  If someone said try this it will really fuck up I was all over it! Please. please get this under control! I have wasted 30 years more than you have. It does't just go away.  Do not follow in my steps.
Have you thought about attending some meetings to supplement the therapy sessions once a week? Do you think outpatient treatment would work for you? ..I would certainly recommend doing the daily check-in if you don't already and comment on posts a few times a day. That really helps my attitude and outlook on the day...We also have a IRC chatroom. The link is in the sidebar. Drop in sometime if you need to talk...Also try and maybe make a list of things you can do that involve you being out of the house and maybe commit to doing one different thing each day switching it up week to week. Maybe one day you go to a museum maybe the next you go to a movie you've been wanting to see the next day maybe you go for a walk/run/hike/bike ride. ..I like recommending making lists. It may not work for every person but I know it worked for me. Maybe worth a shot. I know sitting around doing nothing alone at the beginning of sobriety can be brutal but you can do this!..As for your anxiety have you thought about making an appointment with your doctor about this? Maybe there is something you can be prescribed that can help...Best wishes /u/remixzYE you got this. I will not drink with you today!
