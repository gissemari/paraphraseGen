Man I've been grinding my teeth for the last eight hours. I left work eight hours ago and I've felt like shit since (1am local time)...A friend I was supposed to meet tomorrow canceled my roomate left for home and the few friends I was in a mood to see were away as well. I don't have my guitars with me anything I tried to do on PC just annoyed me. A nap just threw me out of rythm...I've been walking the city for a few hours feeling most lonely in a long time. Not in a mood to talk to anybody scared of being alone. I even made a fucking Badoo profile...Good news is the worst is over. I feel the balance comming back. Writing this post reminds me that the struggle is real even when everything seems fine. I'm grateful that things like this don't happen as often as they used to. I'm proud that I stayed sober. And I take this as a sign to try to connect more...Thanks for reading have a happy holiday (if that is the case for you). I will not drink with you today...TL;DR: Felt lonely as fuck made it through.

Hello .I'm glad you re feeling that you are settling down again I too was feeling a little agitated earlier  its hotter than hell my kids have been bickering all evening and hubby is out for the evening .........I took myself out for a sweaty walk and feel better especially knowing my kids will go to bed soon and I can reclaim the TV for a bit ...IWNDWYT
What is it with today and agitation? I've been obsessing over stupid stuff feeling lonely crying about things that don't usually stress me that much. It's been a little rough but still here trying to fall asleep and sober. IWNDWYT
