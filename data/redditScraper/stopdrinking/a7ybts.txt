First the longest I've quit was five weeks but that was almost nine years ago.  I quit for two weeks somewhere between six months to a year ago.  I stuck with beer as I (usually) knew how to pace myself.  I'm a complete disaster with hard liquor and I hate wine.  I drank no less than a six-pack a day but often 8-12.  I'm a 5'4" 43-year-old woman 170 pounds.  I've had addiction issues my entire life once was heavily addicted to ephedrine but quit that once they started monitoring it.  I've smoked since I was 14.  My weight stayed around 135 until I started drinking more heavily and as I started to age as well.  I am a chronic relapser.  I can quit for 2-3 days but it seems like something tragic or stressful always happens when I quit.  Right now everything is pretty calm.  We have no major plans for Christmas no company coming I don't talk to my family so don't have that stressor.  Right now I'm Juuling plan to quit that for the New Year and have a little bit of weed to help take the edge off but am also going to quit that when it runs out.  I am currently not working so that helps.  I need to get this shit under control so I can get a job.  That's my focus...When I quit for two weeks this last time I lost about eight pounds in the first week water weight no doubt.  I'm not noticing that as much this time but I haven't really been paying much attention to it.  I weighed myself daily last time haven't stepped on a scale once this time.  I just don't care because it doesn't matter to me.  Aside from reading/checking in here I really try not to put much focus on the quit.  One day I'll have zero energy and eat all day but yesterday I was full of energy and barely ate.  Yesterday I woke up with a decent headache but today I woke up fine.  I slept great last night was up by 5:00 this morning.  I usually suffer from horrible acid reflux but that's really tapering off.  I've been sleeping propped up for a good five years.  I don't recall taking antacids at all yesterday and it's always a daily thing- at least one pill and several chewables; I actually have to keep some on my nightstand...My muscles don't ache and my chronic knee pain is not nearly as bad.  I can't believe just nine days of not drinking could have such a dramatic effect on it.  My body usually really hurts when I sleep and I didn't notice it as much during the night last night...The things I've been able to accomplish in a day are really surprising.  I feel like the energizer bunny when I'm feeling good.  I can sit here and imagine how my body would feel when I took my first drink of the day- it was like putting on a suit that weighed a thousand pounds.  If I was doing something that required little energy like cooking/food prep I was okay but if I needed muscle power it was like trying to do everything underwater.  ..Anyhoo if you've made it this far thanks for listening to me ramble.
