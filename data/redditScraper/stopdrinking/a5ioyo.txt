I've made it 34 hours...again. I had quit for a year and a quarter but ended up havi g a relapse..Barely slept last night as the anxiety was just horrible. I'm hoping that tonight is a better night....Speaking with an addition counsellor today also..Hope that I can stick with it again...

You can do this but remember that you don't have to do it alone.
Welcome back!
