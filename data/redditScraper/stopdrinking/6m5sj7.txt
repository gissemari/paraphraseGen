Today I had 5 NA beers!! And it was great. I really enjoyed it. I started figured out what happens if they were alcoholics beers...I felt .so good to be sober at the end of the day... I think that every little moment is important to learn... Its my first real abstinence time in 7 years! Im not afraid of relapse...I know I will continue to move forward to sober.... I know that I dont want this alcoholic live ......

May I ask why you had the nonalcoholic beers? Was it for the taste? Did they really taste THAT good? Just asking because I entertained the idea briefly but read somewhere (forget where) that nonalcoholic drinks maintain the neural connections that drinking equals fun and we want those connections to weakened not strengthened. .I won't drink with you today.

I had an urge earlier and a drank an na beer called st Pauli. Or something like that it quenched that itch in me that was going to head out to the bar to get drunk. If I have to drink a na beer to prevent me from drinking ALCHOL than so be it. I rather pick up a nonalcoholic beer than pick up booze.
