I had a single beer. It was an IPA so it got me a little buzzed. I ended up pouring a 2nd but pouring all of it out. It just confirmed the fact that I don't want to drink anymore. It didn't feel good it was dehydrating.. it just isn't what I want anymore. For anyone around the 1 to 2 week mark and are struggling with cravings... just don't give in. It's definitely not worth it. I'm done with alcohol. Time for some La Croix and Netflix today!

Good job quitting when you already had one beer. Last time I messed up I thought "Sod it lets get drunk". Which only served to give one hell of a hangover. Not worth it...Glad you're here not drinking again!
Good on you for stopping at that. I fear I'd be right back to my 'old ways' if I had even a sip. Hell. I know I would. ..Stay focused OP. You've got this. 
I can't believe how excited I am that my SO just went out grocery shopping and is bringing me home some new LaCroix. 
Yup last night at day 11 i was at a party and there was vodka jelly shots. I took one because the birthday girl was so excited about having made them and they were glitter jelly. Felt the burning in my tummy and that was about it.
