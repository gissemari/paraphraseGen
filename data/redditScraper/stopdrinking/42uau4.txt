I've struggled with my sobriety for the better part of two years and in the last 6 months have had a great success finding my stride and being happy with myself....This sub is always an inspiration browsing on here reading everyday struggles helps keep me in check.  If you're reading this and not sure if posting your story will help just know that sometimes reading a story is exactly what someone like me needs....Thanks for being a great community.
