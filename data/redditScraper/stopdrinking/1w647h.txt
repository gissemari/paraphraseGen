I'm a 31 year old male. Have been lurking on this sub for about a year. Not sure exactly why but I find all the posts and stories interesting and it is inspiring seeing people turning their lives around. I do not consider I have an alcohol dependency but am a regular drinker. Generally one to two beers a night and say four or five on Friday and Saturday nights. Will have an occasional big night out where I get wasted have sometimes felt anxious and embarrassed about my behaviour the next day. This only happens a couple of times a year but I am scared I might do something stupid like cheat on my girlfriend. One time I inadvertently saved myself by spilling a drink on a very attractive girl I had been speaking two for a couple of hours and things where definitely entering the danger zone because my impulse control was drowning in booze. ..While my drinking does not increase I also seem to struggle to bring it below this level...In particular alcohol causes me anxiety particularly in relation to my job as a lawyer which can be incredibly stressful... My social circle is full of big partiers who don't seem to be slowing down notwithstanding we're all into our thirties. ..At the moment I am having break from alcohol. Been three weeks exactly and plan on going until the end of February at least. I've been having a month or two off every year for the last two years. I notice a huge difference in my health well being finances in these periods. My job performance noticably improves as well. ..My goal in this sober period is to put away some serious finances and get a six pack which is a pretty shallow goal but have been going to the gym for the last six months and am getting pretty close but don't think I can get there while I'm drinking. ..Like a lot of posters here the big challenge is maintaining a social life. With my friends if you're not drinking you may not as we'll bother coming out. I have a fantastic girlfriend but I think she finds my sobriety very dull and would prefer if I was drinking. ..Anyway I don't want to trivialise what others are going through but wanted to introduce myself and say hello. .

Hello. It's interesting to hear from someone who doesn't identify as alcoholic but still admits that drinking is problematic. I hope this site can aid you in your determination. Welcome.
