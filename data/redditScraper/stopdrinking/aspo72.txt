Take a break. I struggle with moderation namely the day(s) after drinking. I look forward to having a few beers the next day. I almost never exceed 5 beers over the span of several hours but I'm uncomfortable with how much I think of alcohol. I went 25 days without alcohol in January. Felt good. Was a little bored but it was probably the most productive 25 days I've had in a long while. ..I'm training to do 2 sprint triathlons and a half marathon and after having 3 IPAs I never want to train the next morning. I don't want to give up alcohol forever but I'd like to take a good long break. My birthday is at the end of March and I'd like to celebrate with friends with a few drinks but I'm not sure I will. ..I'd like to check in on this sub for accountability especially on Friday and Saturday nights. ..Thanks for providing encouragement and support. You guys are amazing.

Good on you for taking a break. We're happy to be here for you and hold ourselves accountable :)...The marathons all sound so exciting - it sounds like it's giving you lovely incentive to keep motivated in sobriety!..Looking forward to seeing you back here on / before your birthday :).
A 30 day detox was useful for me. 
Story seems similar to me. I was noticing how much my life was being entangled with alcohol. I'm taking a break and I haven't regretted it one bit! Weekends are hard but this sub helps me.
