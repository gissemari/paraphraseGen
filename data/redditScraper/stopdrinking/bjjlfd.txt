I'm back at two weeks sober today. Getting out of this 6-month relapse has really sucked balls but I'm glad the two-week bump is over. It's encouraging that this has felt like a return to normalcy rather than the other way around. Two weeks sober is the longest I've been sober since sometime in October I think. ..Anyway not a whole lot else to say! Just wanted to check in and say I won't drink with you all today.
