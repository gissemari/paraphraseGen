In a couple hours I'll have gone my first 3 days without a drop of alcohol after 5ish years...And I feel fantastic. I know it's early and challenges will come but right now my anxiety is a faint background whisper I'm motivated I'm excited for each new day and my relationship with my so has never been better...I'm not looking for anybody to warn me of possible struggles coming up. I have a therapist for that. I just want to share my excitement for this new journey...I was the kind of person to think that I could never change. Put off quitting for years. Always figured I couldn't even go a day without drinking. Well I proved myself wrong and seriously if I can go three days you can manage your first. It's one step at a time...I plan on checking in again after my first week then first month then first year. Hopefully this journey keeps going as well as it has after only 3 days.
