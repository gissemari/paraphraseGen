Hi all!..Anyone else struggle with addiction of close relatives while in recovery? ..I'm almost 9 months in and have been struggling with a mother that is "functioning" as an alcoholic. While we always have had a close relationship I find it to be strained now that I am in recovery and she continues to binge drink. She's made off the cuff comments about the change in relationship or about how one day I will be able to drink again. ..Not sure how to navigate this one without hurting feelings. My recovery comes first at least for now so I'm thinking the conversation is going to have to happen soon with regard to my having a hard time being around drunkenness. ..Any suggestions?

My approach would be to speak with her while she's sober and say:.."Mom I want to ask for your support.  I've learned that alcohol plus me creates Undesired consequences.  I've chosen to eliminate that from my life.  It's not necessary that you like that choice for myself.  It is necessary that you respect that I've decided it's best for me.  When you make "off the cuff comments about the change in relationship or about how one day I will be able to drink again" I perceive that as a lack of support for my and a lack of respect for my choices".  I'm asking you to stop doing that."..That's me...Today I forgo just ONE drink -The First One
