Holiday gatherings are a time and place where our ability to stay sober can be pushed to its limits.  Traditions nostalgia stress comfort family friends booze everywhere... all of these things are amped up and make for an easy path to the dark side.  Whether because of pleasure or pain the temptation to drink this weekend might very well be greater than we are planning for.  ..One thing I learned early on in my sobriety is that I am at my greatest risk when I am caught off guard.  To be successful I had to make plans for getting through not only the expected moments but also the *unexpected* moments of temptation.  These days I can usually just ride out moments of temptation stay busy and they eventually pass without too much trouble.  However riding out the storm can be difficult when you are trapped in a house with crazy aunt Barbara who keeps offering drinks and arguing politics.  ..My go to plan for staying sober consists of the following with new emphasis for holiday gatherings:..When I quit drinking I needed the following:..1. Plans for how I was going to get through each day without drinking.  This has several parts:..   a. Alternatives to time spent drinking alcohol: [Exercise](/r/SDrunners) reading new hobbies.  ..   b. Changing my routines. No more stopping at the store after work.  Instead of cocktails I had herbal tea before bed.  ..   c.  Avoiding places and people where there is temptation or pressure to drink.  AKA Keeping with [dry people and places.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2szkp8/the_least_popular_advice_dry_people_dry_places/)  This was especially important in the early days but I still keep it in mind.  ..   d. What do I do in an emergency situation?  ie somebody shoves a glass of wine in my hand.  How am I going to react?  [The time to decide is *before* the event happens not in the moment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/381vwp/on_the_importance_of_not_making_decisions/)..**Holiday gatherings can be tricky because we are sometimes forced to overrule the dry people and places advice and we are in a situation that is outside of our new normal sobriety routine. The key here is to plan ahead of time for possible difficulty and have a course of action mapped out so you don't have to make decisions in the moment.**.  ..'2. Support.  There are lots of options for this.  AA therapy primary care doctor family.  I used /r/stopdrinking for most of my support.  There's lots of great information here and great people too.  ..**Again support can be tricky for the holidays some of these options might not be available.  If you don't have local support you always have the great people in SD to help you through a tough moment.  There are people here that want you to succeed.**..'3. Mental awareness.  I needed to remember the [state I was in when I quit](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/4e0y7r/one_year_ago_on_a_thursday_i_woke_up_knowing_that/) and why [I can never go back.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/17hwpk/for_those_struggling_with_the_label_alcoholic_and/)  I needed to be aware of my thoughts in order to anticipate and deal with my cravings before they became a problem.  ..**This is a big one for me.  I believe that as long as I am honest with myself in recalling the severity of the problem I will never stop working towards the solution.  If there is something that you wrote or read that truly captures the reasons you want to be sober keep it close to you.  I like the 'I can never go back' link above.  I read it again whenever I am having trouble.**..'4.  All of these things together weren't enough unless I took [action](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) all day every day to make this succeed.  I read /r/stopdrinking posts obsessively and participated in the discussions. I paid attention to my thoughts to make sure I wasn't [planning a relapse.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3h1e80/question_for_people_who_ever_relapsed_after_2_or/cu3g38u/)    ..**Just because it's a holiday doesn't mean I'm not taking action.  I might be on vacation but my sobriety is not.**..The key for me is that this is not a passive process. I couldn't just wake up and say "I don't want to drink today" I had to say "I'm not going to drink today and this is how I'm going to do it..."  And then make my sober plan for the day...Make a plan. Execute the plan. Have a sober Thanksgiving!.
