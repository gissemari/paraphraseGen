I'm 27 and have been drinking heavily for almost 10 years. Today I had to tell my SO that I was really done. I've gone on '6 week detoxes' to lose weight and try to be healthier. Or so I said to others. I've struggled with self control and body aches and pains that I feared to be from excess drinking. Besides dehydration I've luckily been spared I hope. Here's what I told them; .."Listen I'm sorry. I just need you to know that quitting drinking isn't an easy thing for me. It's what I've used to deal with my copious amount of anxiety and depression. I don't think I have a healthy relationship with it and I don't really want to plan on drinking again because I've proven to myself that can't moderate myself.   I also believe it's what's causing a lot of my physical problems as well. So just know that I'm done and I need to be held accountable. I'm sorry I've been rude and I shouldn't take it out on you. "..They took it better than expected l saying they never saw it affecting me negatively. I suppose some of us are great at hiding some things.  Here's to a happier and healthier future.
