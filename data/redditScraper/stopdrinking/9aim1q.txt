Its bank holiday weekend and I am so craving a drink right now. Its like a war between the devil and the  angel on my shoulders. One is saying" Go on. Its bank holiday tomorrow. You have nothing planned. You can have one or two." Then the other is saying " No! You can't just have one or two. It will be more. You can't chuck it all in now. You have been doing well. You will be so glad tomorrow." ..I'm gonna hang out here for a while until this passes. ..This is so hard

It can be truly hard but the craving will pass.  And you WILL be glad tomorrow if you listen to your angel today. ..My go-to craving-breakers are ultra- dark chocolate and earthy teas but some people prefer ice cream and flavored seltzer. Do you have any favorite treats you could indulge in?
It is very hard but the buzz is so fleeting and the self loathing lasts so much longer. I'm struggling too but IWNDWYT.

I'm struggling right now as well. Trying to find something to occupy my time. It's my focus and I hate that. We will be strong together!
Just keep telling yourself you are not giving up anything. You have got rid of something toxic and damaging to you. Remember all of the reasons you have quit. Keep going sending you love and strength xx
In a spot like that I do things like... go for a long walk but bring no money. The pause/distraction gives time for the feeling to pass...Hang in there.
Thank you all for taking the time to comment. I took the advice on board and decided the best thing to do was to take myself off to bed early. Now it's 4am and I'm wide awake but so happy with myself for not drinking. I know I can do this. ..IWNDWYT
