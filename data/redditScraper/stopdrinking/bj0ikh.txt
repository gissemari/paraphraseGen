I am 8 months sober from alcohol and was about 7 months weed free as well until about a month when I decided to smoke and have a few times since then. I'm not sure how I feel about the decision or how it impacts my sobreity. In the past when I was drinking weed was something I could take or leave and wouldnt really seek out but would use when others were partaking and it didnt cause me any issues. .Alcohol was always what I was truly after but would use weed when booze when unavailable since until recently I was underaged. Anyways a month ago I decided I wanted to smoke and didnt really think it through but convinced myself it was a good idea and kinda felt like relapse thinking I had done in the past. .Anyways I ended up smoking with a friend and quickly found myself seeking it out and thinking about so i feel like I'm just trying to use any means possible for escape now that booze is out of the question since i decided it's not worth the trouble anymore. .Kinda long but basically it seems that for me at least basically anything that changes the way I feel is something that I'm gonna find a way to abuse it if I allow myself to run free with it whatever it is such as caffeine nicotine and weed and booze so it's probably for the best I avoid weed to prevent myself from overindulging.
