Its the best thing you can do for yourself. Keep up on the streak you are on now and create a personal best record every single day. Its a very small achievement but a very motivational tool. Its a small achievement with a lot of impact. Its really not worth relapsing. I know its very broad to say that but its the simplest. .Stay strong be a Man of Steel. Prove every person and even yourself wrong.

Please be mindful of speaking from the I here on SD. But I can attest every day I'm sober is indeed setting a new record for me.
