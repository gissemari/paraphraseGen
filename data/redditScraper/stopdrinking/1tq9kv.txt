Wow. It has been an amazing year. So much has changed and I've grown so much...I'm happy with myself which is something I thought I would never say.  ..I just woke up I felt sick and so I called up a friend for advice. He was someone I shouldn't have called but it was habit. He was aloof. I think he might be leaving the program.   ..It's scary. I used to look up to his sobriety and serenity so much. I stopped looking up to his serenity a few months ago. I stopped looking up to his program recently. ..Sobriety is so fragile. Life is so fragile...But it is also so beautiful. And I have learned so much this past year. And yeah it sucks when friends drift from the program or from sobriety but it also teaches me a lot...I know people who get frustrated or annoyed watching friends relapse. I get scared. People hang out with like minded people. ..I respect the relapse. It is a great beast looming over me. I fight it off but every day it returns lurking in the shadows waiting for me to let my guard down so it can strike. ..I have 19 months and I still respect that beast as much as I did when I walked into those rooms 2 years ago. But I know that I can get cocky. I know I can get comfortable. That is frightening...But it was a good year to be me. I moved 4 times. I got 2 cats. I got a tattoo. I started running. I brought my GPA up. I made beautiful friends. I lost friends to relapse and to death. I fell in love and had my heart broken. But everyday was wonderful and taught me something new about living in sobriety. ..**what** **did** **this** **year** **teach** you **about** **sobriety**

Sharing the gift of sobriety burnishes it ever brighter. Thanks stopdrinking.
Sorry to hear about your friend...It sounds like you're on the right track here... Keep it up...I've learned so much about myself this year.  I've been able to keep such a cooler head in hot situations.  I've gone from quitting because I felt I had to to quitting because I want to.  I went from being uncomfortable in situations where others were drinking to it not even being a concern anymore.  I don't have to psych myself up to go out anymore...But more than anything I too am happy.  I'm happy with myself.  I'm happy with my marriage.  I'm happy with my job.  I'm happy with my sobriety.  I'm happy with my life.  And I never thought I'd be able to say that.
Congrats on all of your progress!  I agree that complacency leads to problems.  I hope things turn out all right for your friend.
That I can have alcohol or I can have everything. Today I choose everything. 
I had a year that was both good and bad. Early in the year I relapsed after 7 months due to romantic woes (heartbreak is a bitch.) stayed relapsed until I quit again in August. This go-round has felt much more peaceful.. I no longer feel as though I'm swimming frantically against a harsh current. Not drinking now feels easier than drinking. The few times since August that I've been around drunk people it has only strengthened my convictions. I had some "friends" desperately try to get me to drink with them. That was the last night I saw them. This time around I'm also trying to avoid serious romantic relationships for the first year since that is A trigger for me. It's been a struggle because I feel like I am constantly being pursued and I have to beg off for friendship. I'm working on a hard degree so that helps to keep me occupied. 
Sorry about your friend...This year has taught me that sobriety is achievable for me which I wasn't sure of for a long long time.  I am so grateful for this wonderful subreddit and posts like yours.
