Just curious why did you tell her no? Sounds like you have a really supportive GF. Just for today I won't drink with you.
It's the subconscious mind. I remember going to the liquor store and buying drinks without ever really thinking about what i was doing.  It was crazy like I was a robot but then I realized that my mind is tricking me into drinking and I now I'm fighting it.  
Well in my opinion anytime you make it through a craving you get stronger. At your point physical cravings didn't exist anymore for me it was all mental cravings or emotional cravings. Good job.
