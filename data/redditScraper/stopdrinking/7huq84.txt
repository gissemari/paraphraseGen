Hi all. I have lurked for a little while but finally feel comfortable enough to post. I originally got sober about a year ago after (what I now realize) was a poorly done and harmful intervention at my job. I stayed sober for 4 months but since March it's been on and off the relapse train for various lengths of time usually a couple of weeks sober during the longest stretches. I tried AA for about 6 months but the higher power and powerlessness aspects did not work for me although I know AA has been very helpful for many. ..For whatever reason I feel ready to actually stop drinking for real this time so I hope that represents a change in my thinking.  I think I had to take my self-loathing and wallow in it making myself as miserable as possible to decide that I have to stop drinking if I want to recapture even the tiniest shred of happiness or even just the absence of despair. I've done a couple of SMART meetings over the past few days so we'll see how that works as I try to put together tools that feel right to me rather than just doing AA because that is what  you are supposed to do  even though it was (in hindsight) not right for me. ..I know that the only way to show people I've stopped drinking is to stay stopped so that's on me. Right now I just feel intense shame and embarrassment at my failures at sobriety previously which feel like they are written on my forehead in huge letters as well as the tremendous anxiety of trying to prove myself. I would literally grovel at the feet of my coworkers if it would help me overcome this shame and regain a shred of their trust. ..This community has been very helpful to me in giving me hope that I can redeem myself and that there is a group of people who understand and don't judge. ..So thank all of you. I will not drink with you today.

Do it for yourself first. You have one life to live be the best version of you. #IWNDWT
It's hard to look back and see things we don't like. You can look at them as behaviors you no longer wish to do...That's how I see it. I know when I drink alcohol I act a fool treat people I love like shit acted as if everyone else in the asshole...When I am sober I don't act out like that so I stay sober to be a better person today...IWNDWYTD!
