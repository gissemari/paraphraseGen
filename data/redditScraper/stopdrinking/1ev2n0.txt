I moved out to slc when i got on the wagon but I have really struggled to find any meetings that provide the type of fellowship I want. I'm not all gung-ho on the god thing and it seems that most of the meetings I've come across are basically pushing jesus on the members. Also I'd like to find some place that isn't cliquey. Really more welcoming. .Any suggestions are greatly appreciated :)
