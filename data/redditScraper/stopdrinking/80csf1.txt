I'm nervous as hell. Mainly because if people recognise me and realise I've relapsed and fucked up.

I've never been but AA doesn't strike me as a place where people point fingers and judge. You'll be fine! If you decide to go make an update thread and let us know how it went I'd definitely be reading!
I bet they'll embrace you as a human being just like themselves!..They know that the hardest thing to do is to walk through that door...They will Celebrate your Courage!!
The only reaction you're likely to get is that they are glad you are back.  Way more than just you in that room have relapsed.
I used to stress about this. Then I met an 80 year old man who told me he was in aa for 5 years before he got sober and I've never been embarrased to go back since. 
Telling others what happened will help you and them.  It serves as a reminder of what can happen. 
Well if anyone understands they do.  It'll probably be a big relief.  IWNDWYT
