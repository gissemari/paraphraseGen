Constant relapses repeatedly having to detox after a session and hurting every one I love. Why can't I stop doing this to myself. I have made such a mess of my life

Ever considered trying psychedelics
I'm sorry you're struggling. Have you tracked the events and thoughts that lead up to a relapse? I found it to be a useful exercise to me to consistently write down how I was feeling what I was thinking how I wished I was feeling what I could do goals fears everything. I did that for a couple of months and it really started to help me change my thought process about alcohol and not *want* to drink anymore...Don't give up. You're worth it.
Hi there. .I really know how you feel it's so overwhelming to deevaluate yourself constantly when you are trying to detox and actually trying to put an end to the destructive behavior. ..But know that this is a disease. I am sure you don't intentionally hurt the people you love it's not the real you. The path to sobriety is for many of us long and hard..I've been relapsing for 8 months now and in those months I've never acted to wrongfully to the people I love. All we can do is to admit it and face it as you are doing now! ..I believe you are a good person and that beating yourself up is the damn alcohol demon talking! ..I will not drink with you today!   
Hi. I tried to messenger you and fucked up..Please talk to me it you're feeling down.
I'm sending positive thoughts your way Lucy.  Keep going!  I struggled for many years before it got better. There is hope! I'm rooting for you.
