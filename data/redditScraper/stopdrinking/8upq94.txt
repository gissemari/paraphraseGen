Today marks 100 days of sobriety for me and like many other people's stories I've read my life has made a complete 180 since I put down the bottle. I'm posting this for myself and also for the many people I know who are lurking like I once was considering cutting down or eliminating their drinking who feel unreasonably powerless against alcohol. I did not think 100 days was possible let alone a week and now years seem possible even desirable! I've learned sobriety is better than moderation and I'm hoping somebody identifies with my story here and finds it useful in some way. I know this is long so just read what parts appeal to you : )...I started drinking in college and went from "I don't really like this but everybody else is doing it so I'll keep trying to" to "I need to integrate this into basically every social function" in a few quick years. Between then and now (about a decade) my drinking progressed but I still had some time periods where my drinking didn't seem like it was "problem drinking" to me sometimes I could go a month or two without picking up. Thing was I wasn't in control of it my context was. When things were going well I didn't drink much and when they weren't I drank a lot. Pretty soon "bad days" were the only days I ever had. About two years ago things really sped up for me. I was in an awful relationship with myself and my romantic partner (also probably an alcoholic) we fought frequently I was depressed and I was drinking a bottle of wine every night and a few months ago it was up to a half liter of vodka a night. Over the years I had isolated myself socially and learned every bad mental habit one could learn. It was hell. I was so depressed &amp; anxious getting through the day was just torture until I could get back to alcohol which didn't even make me feel good it just lessened how bad I felt for a while till even alcohol made me feel bad. I never got in trouble with the law my doctor my job my family or my friends. Only one other person my main drinking buddy ever knew or suspected I had a problem. I never blacked out and only towards the very end did I get to the point where I literally could not control my alcohol consumption even when drinking socially. ..Sobriety only became a path I went down because I had exhausted every other option. I tried making rules around my drinking (only drinking these times or these amounts) going to therapy moving leaving a toxic relationship (which was a good idea but didn't solve my alcoholism-related problems) doing other self-work changing my hobbies and habits nothing worked. Only when it was "keep slowly dying or be sober" did sobriety seem like a real option to me. And to be honest slowly dying was pretty attractive. I was never bold enough to even contemplate killing myself but I did want to not be around anymore. I just hoped something else would do the job preferably painlessly. Most mornings I woke up I was disappointed that I had yet another day to live through. ..I tried to quit or lessen my drinking many times. The month before my last quit I had string together a day or two here or there but I never made any real progress. But I kept at it. And one day I woke up and I had the "spiritual experience" described by folks in AA. I am an atheist but that day I woke up with a will that I had never had over alcohol. It was sudden and it was powerful. My decision to quit wasn't frenzied it wasn't difficult it was calm. I don't think a personal god reached down and did this I imagine there's some neurochemical explanation but I don't care what the explanation is. I knew on that day that alcohol and me were broken up and that I'd gotten my closure that I wouldn't be tempted by it any longer. I don't know why it happened that day there wasn't anything special about it. But I think that the self-work I was doing before that day probably contributed greatly to it. When I have a stressful day or drive past the liquor store I *never* think of getting a drink and that is an amazing thing to me...**Changes in My Life**..* I enjoy everything in life so much more now. I literally stop and smell the flowers food tastes better and I am learning to be grateful for the everyday things in life. I can just sit on a bench look out at nature or people or whatever with a smile on my face and just enjoy being present for things. The pink cloud came and went and this is still true...* My depression has basically vanished. When I have a bad day I don't just assume every day afterwards will be horrible as well. I don't assume life is pointless and there's no reason to continue putting effort into it. I have some context to say "I'll do what I can to feel better and if I can't feel better at least I'll probably feel better tomorrow" and I almost always do. I find myself planning for and looking forward to the future whether it's next week or next year. In essence my depression has vanished. I still get anxious as all people do but I don't constantly feel anxiety from out of nowhere. Most days are "good days" which is amazing to me. You know how depression is this horrible feeling which blankets all things you do or think in life with a tint of sadness depair etc? Like even things you would normally enjoy? Well sobriety has been the exact opposite for me. And I medidate now every day 10-20 minutes and I enjoy it. Depressed me could not have been alone with his thoughts for that long...* All of my habits are better. I brush my teeth TWICE a day now I eat much healthier and I'm able to set other goals and stick to them. I exercise several days a week and actually enjoy it! I have started using a bullet journal which really helps with organization for me. I break things into smaller manageable bites and I build up better habits. This comes as a result of work but as they say "You can experience the pain of discipline or the pain of regret". The most important thing to me about this is that I am learning to trust myself again which helps loads with my self-esteem. When I commit to do something for myself I do it. And if I'm not perfect I have learned to cut myself some slack and treat myself as a friend instead of beating myself up over it. When I started not drinking I was literally at /r/nonzeroday. For a whole week my only goal was to brush my teeth once...* I am making friends. More than that I enjoy being around people even other people who have a drink in their hand so long as they're not drunk. I like listening to people's boring stories about what they did at work or how their kids are not because I give a shit about their kids but because I appreciate spending time with these people. I walk up to people and talk to them. I find myself seeing others through a much more compassionate lens. My social skills are 100% better than before...* I have lots of time and life is feeling fuller. When I first quit days felt so incredibly long I struggled to fill them. I read I walked I exercised I went to every social event I could find so I wouldn't isolate myself with my thoughts at home in my usual drinking place. Now I have added so many things to my schedule that I'm having to scale back what I'm doing because I am involved in so many things that I am excited about. I play sports I go to the gym I have new friends I garden I go to AA meetings I volunteer...* My sleep is getting better. Managing a sleep schedule has always been difficult for me but I'm getting better at it. Every once and a while I can string together a few days where I wake up at 9 or 10. When I am actually tired sleep feels amazing and I wake up with energy for the day. I still have a long way to go on this project but I am improving...* Feelings are a thing now. I actually experience them instead of just trying to delete them with alcohol which doesn't work. No more getting drunk and crying uncontrollably for 10 minutes with no reason or understanding of why it's happening my releases come more naturally now. I even appreciate bad feelings sometimes. I always thought the frontal lobe should be running the show and I ignored my feelings for so many years. Turns out I need to listen to them sometimes and when I do they reward me with warm fuzzy feelings. Learning how to interact with feelings is new for me but I am learning...* I didn't lose a whole lot of weight (actually I think I've gained some all told that post-quit sweet tooth is no joke!) but there is no question that I am a much healthier person both physically and mentally than 100 days ago. Honestly it feels like years ago emotionally. My skin has actually gotten worse I think it's because my immune system isn't depressed all time but that ok by me go make all the zits you want it's well worth the trade off...** Tools I have used **..I should note that I didn't use *any* of these tools before quitting drinking. I knew that being sober and not depressed all the time meant learning new ways to deal with stress and emotions in life so I focused a lot on this area and I still do. ..* Bullet journaling (bulletjournal.com). This helps me organize my thoughts and my week. Most importantly it helps remind me to keep goals small and achievable. When I am feeling un-accomplished I can look back at the last week and see how much I have done. I also have a mood tracker which helps me see on bad days that good days are what life is mostly made of. And I have pages I reference for when I'm feeling anxious restless etc. Like little cheat sheets for life. This thing goes everywhere with me. I find if I write something down it gets it out of my head and gets me one step closer to feeling at peace with things. Unlike the calendar on my phone I don't open this and then wake up 10 minutes earlier not knowing why I opened it and having lost 10 minutes of my life...* Meditation. I used to laugh at the idea of meditation but I've found it really helps with whatever the background emotion is that makes me a relentless productivity monster/ball of anxiety. Learning to clear my mind is so helpful and when I am feeling stressed I can sometimes recall that mental space to take things down a notch. I used Insight Timer and Headspace both of which I found really helpful to get started. I meditate daily and on the days I don't do it I notice...* Exercise. Outside of SD this has been the single most important thing for me. I play some pick-up games I go to the gym sometimes I just go walk around. Without alcohol I had to learn new ways to cope with stress and this is probably the main one I go to now because it works in every situation. Angry? Hit the gym. Lonely? Hit the gym. Bored? Hit the gym. Having this planned in my routine in the form of volleyball gives me exercise to look forward to every week...* [How to Deal with the Fuck Its](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/8ckhyv/how_to_deal_with_a_case_of_the_fuck_its_repost_2/) by our very own /u/PJMurphy..* **The absolute most important tool for me has been /r/stopdrinking**. I got sober thanks to the folks in SD and started attending AA meetings later down the road. I'm not sure if I'll keep attending them long-term but I'm finding them worthwhile for the time being. I do intend to stay active here though and I get a lot out of reading everybody's struggles and wisdom whether they're on day 1 or year 10 I have found myself learning from everybody. This is truly an amazing place and I feel a strong connection to all of you. Thank you for all your posts. Thank you...**Each and every one of you is so incredibly brave and strong for coming back for tackling your drinking and battling whatever demons drove you to the bottle in the first place. Even if you're just here lurking and have drank enough to be halfway to oblivion the fact that you are here reading this is amazing and I hope you keep coming back because /r/stopdrinking works! You may feel alone and hopeless but I have been right there. Whatever you are ashamed of somebody else on here shares a similar story. Please be kind to yourself and IWNDWYT &lt;3.**

Congratulations on 100 days and all the positive changes! Stop Drinking saved me too.  IWNDWYT 
Yes! I am at 101 days and feel many of the same things although my drinking career started earlier and was never normal or moderate.  My world has turned around and perhaps I'm the only one noticing but I have never felt better..IWNDWYT 
Congrats on 100 days.  I'll have to look up that bullet journal.  Thanks for reposting the fuckit piece.  I've seen it before and this time I printed.  IWNDWYT
Congrats mate yeah i cant agree more about exercise and eating better it made a massive difference for me and it makes maintaining so much easier you build better habits from it .
What a brilliant post. This resonates so much with my own experience. Both the aha moment seemingly happening at random and the changes in behaviour associated with stopping drinking..Really inspiring..Thank you. 
Thank you for sharing and pointing out how much I have to look forward to! ..IWNDWYT 
I also really only quit when I had exhausted every other option. Now I can't believe I waited so long. It really convinces you that it is your one true friend when it really is your worst enemy. Congrats on your 100! 
Congratulations! I recognize all those positive changes always good to read that I'm not the only one experiencing these massive improvements. Enjoy your new life!!
