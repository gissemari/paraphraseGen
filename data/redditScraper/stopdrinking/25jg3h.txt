I had made it about a week but relapsed at a family thing over the weekend. Yesterday was my day off as well so of course I was wasted. I am too old too busy and have too many things that matter in my life to be doing this. Here's hoping.

Good for you /u/blah2050--you can do this.  Stop drinking + recovery works miracles.  But you need to move the feet.  Don't know how?  Let us know and we will share the experiences that worked for us.
