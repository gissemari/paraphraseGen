I want to quit drinking so bad. Ive been a heavy drinker for the past 10 years minus roughly 2 years total that I was either pregnant or in rehab. I'm so sick of being sick all the time. I hate vomiting and sweating when I wake up until I start drinking again. I surprisingly have a pretty good life and few people know about this struggle but I know I'll lose it all if I don't stop. My husband child everything will be gone. I haven't drank today and I'm sitting in my car vomiting into a bag. I'm sweaty. I don't know how I'll do it but I'm NOT GOING TO DRINK TODAY. The times I've spent sober have literally been the best of my life even when I was in rehab it was so great waking up and being fine. I miss that so much and I am determined to get it back!

It's all about today! You got this. I was there being poisoned and drinking more to cover the pain up. Some times minute by minute. You CAN do this!
