https://youtu.be/7K9MPR4NzdY?t=11s..When I was young I was a spiderman fan. Though I would watch the reruns of the Batman serie from the 60s I wasn't a big fan...I became a fan recently after I heard that quote :..> Villain : you don't have any special powers..> Batman : I have one I never give up..That's a big inspiration for me. Batman is Batman because he never gives up. And through countless hours of reruns I can say that he never gave up. Even when the situation was desperate and he was going to be crushed in the Penguin's umbrella manufacturing plant...I decided to have the "never give up" superpower myself because it's so accessible. Recently two friends told me that I was determined person. That when I decide to act on something it happens. Thanks to my new superpower I stopped drinking. Then I gained weight and decided to lose some and I lost 30lbs...No matter what happens I never give up. In the last year I was offered multiple times a highly paying job. I said no because I want to grow my business. He thinks I'm pig headed... but I know that it's my "never give up" superpower...I never give up. This superpower is accessible to me and it's also accessible to everyone here. Relapse is an event. It doesn't define you as a failure. Never give up...I often think of [that thread](/r/stopdrinking/comments/47guu4/experience_strength_and_hope_from_a_low_bottom/) when I think of never giving up. This is a really good example of that superpower.

Love it! I was a massive fan of the cartoon when I was young too.  Im going to think of this vid next time alcohol is trying to get the better of me. ..Wish you great success with your new business.  I won't drink with you today!
