Firstly I just want to thank everyone who posts here and I admire all of you for the support you give to each other. ..I've struggled for my whole adult life with anxiety and depression. Like many others I have used alcohol as a form of temporary relief knowing it's doing more harm than good. I was in denial that i had a problem with alcohol due to the fact that everyone around me are frequent binge drinkers. Although i don't drink daily i can't stop once i start and the aftermath has been causing some major damage to my already weak mental health. Towards the middle of last year I finally accepted that I do have a problem and gave stopping a shot. I had a 2 week streak in October (Longest in 10 years). Then a 41 day streak from mid December into January. I impulsively stopped at the liquor store and subsequently fell back into my old habits. I'm now on day 3 and feeling optimistic. The biggest hurdle for me will be the change in my social life. I don't like being around drunk people when I'm sober. All my friends drink and most of what we do involves alcohol. Any advice or personal experience would be appreciated. Thank you for reading and I wish all of you the best on your journeys.

I didn't worry about my friends much in the beginning other than to turn down some invites.  There was a lot I needed to work on myself and how to live a sober life before I dealt with friends.  But when I got around to them it was a friend by friend thing.  Some are cool with it others I no longer see.  I have also made new friends as I have picked up new hobbies.
