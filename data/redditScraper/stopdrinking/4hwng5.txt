I'm having a hard time forgiving myself for all the bad decisions and harm I've caused due to my relationship with alcohol. The old sources of wisdom aren't sustaining me as they have in the past and I'm feeling rather despondent. The Tao te Ching isn't speaking to me. I'm too embarrassed to face my family even though they have all forgiven me and are supporting my sobriety. It's just a hard week so far. ..Do you guys have any inspirational thoughts on forgiveness and healing that you can share? I'm pretty down.

I focused on the present day in early sobriety. There is nothing we can change about the past. If I don't drink I am less likely to do shameful things. So staying sober is the most important task at two days sober. What helped me was working the 12 steps of AA. They contain tools for dealing with guilt and regret and help with making appropriate amends when the time is right. That time is only after I had months of solid sobriety. Making apologies early is not a good idea. I didn't have any credibility.  The best thing you can do is stay sober today.
I don't know if you have a kid or not but I remember my therapist asking me (when I was in the throes of self-disgust and negative self-talk about all the incredibly stupid and self-centered crap I did when ddrinking): "Would you talk like that to your son?" Of course I wouldn't! I guess in other words try to go easy on yourself for now. You don't have to do everything today. Just stay sober. That's the best way for me to make amends to my friends and family right now. Best wishes!
Time heals all. I also felt ashamed but family really just wants you to be healthy and happy. Remember that everyone is going through something and if you have already received forgiveness all you can do it move on and be a better person.
