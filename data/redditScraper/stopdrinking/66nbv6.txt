I used to be able to drink. I used to hate to get drunk...I slowly started drinking a decade and somehow it has spun out of control after the last 5 years. ..What started as going out to the bar on the weekends ended up being the only girl alone at the bar 5 nights out of the week. What started out as getting tipsy led to random sex and outbursts...This led to drinking at home alone until the wee hours of the night. This led to drinking at work so I would have a buzz before I kept drinking at the bar or at home...Then my Dad got sick about two years ago...He died on March 9th of this year...This led to a 2 week binge psychotic breaks and almost losing my best friend my boyfriend...I've lost so many people due to my drinking already...I stopped drinking for a 5 days drank one day. I then went 12 days and just had a 2 day binge where I stole and fucked up another friendship...I am on day 6 again. I have drank 3 times in the last 3 plus weeks the least I have in years. ..A switch has flipped in me. I used to have fun. Now if I drink its breakdowns and chaos. I'm thankful for my 3 relapses because it reminded me why I CANT DRINK...Please don't drink with me today.

&gt; Please don't drink with me today...Great idea!  I'll not drink to that :)..That's the thing of it right?  It used to be fun then it became ... wrong on every level.  Good news is the past can't harm you right?  The future is gonna be GREAT!
Once I knew the damage was done there was no real going back. I had relapses but they became less frequent and more awful. The realization that there is literally nothing left for me in the bottle was very freeing. Best wishes and I will certainly join you in not drinking today!
Alcohol works;..Until it doesn't.
