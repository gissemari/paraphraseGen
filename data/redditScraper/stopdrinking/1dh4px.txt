Hey everyone it's Wednesday that means the week's half over! How's it been going? Share your triumphs struggles or just general chat!..Triumph: Setup a home gym after buying a barbell set.  I'm really looking forward to working out without needing to go to the gym...Last night I worked through something tough from my past with my therapist.  It was wonderful to share it and hear her respond in a kind compassionate way...Struggle: Loneliness has been coming in and out lately.  Not a fun feeling but I'm learning how to manage it in a healthier way than I'm used to...General chat: THE SUN!  I got out for my first bike ride since sobering up.  On the weekend we had gorgeous weather and I got out for a long ride with a friend it was incredible...Have a great 24 hours folks!
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph: I've logged more work hours in the past couple weeks than I ever dreamed possible and certainly was impossible while drinking. Moreover I was able to approach it with a sense of gratitude and not a case of the fuck-its...Struggle: Same as above - finding myself hard pressed to keep a balance in life with all the hectic stuff going on but I know that no matter what my circumstances are sobriety is my only real priority. Been doing a lot more reading here than posting lately and it's helped quite a bit - thanks!..General chat: Springtime hell yeah.
Triumph: still sober...Struggle: I don't know if it's the past boozing my ever advancing age or just how I've always been and am just realizing it now but I've recently been struggling with feelings of inadequate smartness.  I try to do things which I feel I should be able to do but I just can't figure out solutions...General chat: ahhh spring!....  haCHEW!
**Triumph:** Coming up on my 30th sober day! Wow it feels good to be drug free and alcohol free. I've been attending meetings almost daily for the past week and I love it especially the way I feel after I come out of a meeting. I try to hit the earlier meetings because it sets the tone for my whole day...**Struggle:** A small part of my brain is trying to rationalize why I should drink. I've been having thoughts about how nothing has changed for me in 30  days. I'm still depressed lonely and to top it all off I'm eating WAAAY more than I used to. I've missed meetings 2 days in a row so that could be a contributing factor for all this negativity. Sleeping helps with depression and my urges to drink. My social anxiety is at an all time high and I HATE it...**General chat:** Plan on hitting up a meeting in a few hours after I watch the sunrise with my cup of coffee. Everyone in the IRC chatrooms are suuuuper sweet and always encouraging. AND I think I might use working out and eating right as a tool to combat my depression. I am so ready for this to be over. ..Have a lovely day ya'll!!!
Triumph: Not speculating as much not projecting or guessing the thoughts of others specifically concerning my wife - this means less negativity in my life...Struggle: Same as last week.  Wife is supposed to encourage our children to call on Tue/Thur and this is the third week it didn't happen.  I sit and look at my phone with bed time stories pulled up on my computer waiting on their call and when it doesn't happen it makes me really sad...General Chat:  Playing around with the Raspberry Pi - have XBMC loaded and streaming all my favorite shows and such.  My wife is a techie and I wish I could share this time with her.  I miss my wife and kids...Another 24 hours of kicking ass everyone!
A beautiful day on tap.  Need to buy some supplies for projects in deck / garden.  And then maybe not procrastinate about doing them!..Then tonight my weekly AA meeting in prison.  Some amazing recovery there and appreciation that we come in to share experience strength and hope. .**those of you having a hard day read this**. Some of these guys have been in 30+ years - they come up for parole consideration every 2 years and routinely get shot down. Talk about need for acceptance! Powerless over dept of corrections...  ..Despite the surroundings the meetings are powerful and at the same time a chance for them to be free for a couple of hours...**Service - I can not say enough for it.  It has helped my recovery enormously.**
That's great about the gym.  In the past I had issues with going *back* out to the gym after getting home (dogs get excited I'm home and then get upset that I just go right back out).  Having stuff for exercising in the house makes a huge difference (and takes away many excuses).  Sorry to see about the loneliness.  If you aren't already maybe an AA or SMART meeting might be a way to connect with people if you don't have other means at your disposal...**Triumph**: You guys are probably getting sick of these but I've lost another 4 pounds.  I'm down from 288 in July and 268 in January to 219.5!  Woo-hoo!  I'm going to look like a freakin' beast on our cruise!..**Struggle**: None.  Life is grand...**General Chat**: Busy as hell at work which is good.  But enjoying biking and Krav Maga.  And it's beautiful out!
wednesday's is usually my mid-week bender day so lets see how I fair later am meeting a friend in a pub but she knows that I am off the booze so lets hope I can be strong :) the consequences of my all day bender last week meant that I spent all day thursday feeling cruddy didnt do any of my work that I was meant to do at home and didnt spend any quality time with my beautiful daughter so here's to a wednesday and none of the above!!
Woo hoo half over. My triumph is living a program every day.   My struggle is acknowledging feelings and letting them be.  I am learning I don't have to accept them as fact nor do I have to act on them.   Yesterday was I very busy day today I am exhausted.  First thought was that I don't have to go to my meeting this morning.  But I know now that if I act on that thought my day will slowly go downhill.  I went to my meeting and got my mind set into recovery mode instead of the poor me mode.  Bring on the rest of the day I'm ready.

Triumph: Closed and moved into my new home! First time homebuyer first time in love with my new house. ..Struggle: Boyfriend sending weird mixed signals. Housewarming gifts in the form of booze. Security threatening my humility...General Chat: Life feels so good so secure right now.
Triumph: nothing special other than still sober.  Wait.  That fucking rocks.  I AM THE CHAMPION...Struggle: a bit of head butting with my 8 year old.  She has some personality traits I'd love to correct.  I need to stop myself from projecting negative thoughts into the future.  For example it pains her to take responsibility for any mistake or wrong choice.  She will go through all sorts of mental contortions to come up with how she was misheard or her actions were misinterpreted etc.  I have a coworker like that and he's the most annoying man on the planet...General chat:  doing a 5k with my daughter this weekend.  She's also signed up for a kids triathlon later this month.  She is psyched!
Fuckin 504 days.  YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
**Triumph:** Yesterday was payday and for the first time in years I have money in my savings account all of my bills are paid and current (namely student loans) and have plenty to last me the next two weeks without dropping $100+ a week on booze. Looks like I will finally be able to get BioShock Infinite and not worry that it is going to cut into my drinking money. Just seven more days to go until I hit 30!..**Struggle:** Being so early into the process of recovery it's still hard to get through a tough day at work and not want to come home and drink it away. That may be my biggest fear of the process -- the actual desire never really going away and that I'll have to basically fight it forever. Hopefully this will fade in time as my health slowly but steadily improves...**General Chat:** Iron Man 3 this Friday. So excited! Talk about a character that alcoholics can relate to. They haven't gone too much into detail in the films but its a big part of his character in the comic books. 
Triumph: Just had one of the best dumps. ..Struggle: Finals research papers and moving (but really those are encouraging me to keep at it)..General chat: Where the hell is summer? It was sixty here yesterday and now it's snowing. I wanted to go running. 
Triumph: Didn't drink yesterday...Struggle: I've been navigating a very difficult email exchange with someone who is very important in my life and who I let down in some major ways in the past. It brings up lots of guilt and shame and also loss and longing. Which I'm trying to handle instead of ignore...General: Allergies. Why god why?
Triumph: Just got back home from a quick vacation from Vancouver. I rented a car to get around the first time I have ever done that.  I had a great great time...Struggle: Spent a bit more than I planned on my trip gonna be a little broke for a couple of weeks...General: Feels good to be home with the cats sleeping in my own bed.  The sun is shining the sky is blue its going to be a beautiful week and the weather this weekend is absolutely gorgeous!  volunteering this Sunday with the CFI (a secular humanist/skeptic organization) to do a park clean up here is Calgary.  Life is good..
Today will be day 10 for me.
Bed. Laying and doing nothin but read and cuddle the dog. I'm pretty stoked. 
Congrats on the home gym! I've thought about doing that some day...Triumph: Sharing with work-folk that I don't drink and generally just opening up...Struggle: I've been forcing myself to deal with some darker patches of my past that I've avoided for most of my life. I don't have access to a therapist right now and I hope what I'm doing is beneficial. Feels like it might be...General Chat: My dad has greatly picked up his drinking the past couple years and despite several "wins" that have come his way he proceeds to further himself into debt and increase his already plentiful drinking. I've been considering having an honest and open discussion with him about it as he's been questioning his own drinking for the first time I know of.
Triumph! Triumph eeeeeevrywhere!..BORUSSIA DORTMUND IS IN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL AND I AM SOBER BUT *DORTMUND IS IN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL*...brb swimming in sea of triumph
So I need a badge reset even though I'm at day 4 now. Had a huge relapse over the last six months. ..Triumph: decided to stop drinking again and really taking control of learning how to live day by day instead of thinking into the future...Struggle: broke up with my husband and seeing him a little more than I should be but its all amicable. Just tears at my heart strings...General chat: my band is starting to sound awesome and I helped write one of the songs we're playing at our next show.
One week! I got my #1 today. ..I haven't been sober for a week in at least 3 years. I believe strongly that I can keep this up. Friends have been very supportive. 
im going to be two years without a single drink soon...everything else is icing on the cake. 
Triumph: Started yesterday running late and with no speaker lined up for my evening meeting and actually get this wasn't in a panic. I had faith it would all work out. That's something relatively new for me in recovery and it felt good. And it actually did work out ended the day with a great meeting and fellowship...Struggle: My schedule's going to change drastically in about a month as I move from school to full time work and I have a lot of anxiety around it. I don't even know exactly what my hours will be yet but I'm terrified I won't be able to go to my home group anymore and that my other self care habits will start falling apart...General chat: Even though I'm very anxious about the change I'm noticing things come up that have the potential for making the transition easier. Like two new meetings starting that have the same format and focus as my home group so even with a new more hectic schedule I'll have three times the likelihood of being able to make one of them. It kinda makes me feel like the universe might be taking care of me. ..Got the day off from school today so I'm gonna clean meditate do some hw and go see my therapist. Actually I think I'll get off reddit and get on that. ..Love you guys and hope you have a wonderful Wednesday!
**Triumph:** 21 days since my last drink.  Rode my bike 8 miles each way to and from work...**Struggle:**  Cravings hit me in the evenings which are no fun.  Struggling a bit with AA.  It seems I can't count my days if I'm still smoking pot.  I'm not sure yet how I feel about it but it's tarnishing my accomplishments in my own head a little....**General Chat:**  Going to jam at my buddy's practice studio tonight.
Triumph: Went to BF's work event at a bar and drank soda. Fewer cravings for the taste of alcohol...Struggle: although so many things are improving since not drinking sometimes I feel like sobriety can be boring. weight loss plateau. ..General Chat: Lots of things planned for this month. The boring feeling will fade as I get busier. Wouldn't have things planned if I was still drinking.  
Triumph: Attended my first AA Meeting ..Struggle: Getting caught up in long term sobriety and not taking it a day at a time.
**Triumph** - 9 days is not too shabby.  I had a stressful night last night felt like I was on edge and about to snap at every little thing.  But I made it through the evening.  Like others have said the stress of not drinking is better than the shame of waking up the next morning frustrated at throwing in the towel...**Struggle** - My roommate (who owns the place) rearranged the patio (we're in a townhouse in the middle of a city with no yard) and put out really heavy planters so I can't get out to comfortably set up my telescope at night.  Stargazing has been my anti-alcohol the last week and a half.  So now I have to either spend half an hour taking down and putting back together the patio or finding a new way to occupy my time...**General chat**:  My Smart Recovery Handbook is in the mail and about to get to me.  I'm looking to a more structured method of dealing with sobriety than just inner-monologuing "Almost to the end of the day and I still haven't had a drink.  I can do this."
