Until a year ago I finally had a wake up call.  I was 30 turned a disgusting pale yellow in my eyes and face and went to the ER.  My liver was functioning horribly.  I went to rehab had a seizure on my 2nd day.  Got done month in rehab was told I had cirrhosis.  Had plenty of tests done and specialist visits often never getting good news.  I was afraid I was going to have a slow and painful death as I heard liver disease is at first it was a driving factor to avoid booze.  ..Around 6 months sober I had a cat scan done to check for liver cancer since I was more prone due to cirrhosis.  I finally got good news that no signs of scarring were shown and after some extra tests to double check I have no damage to my liver.  I still want nothing to do with drinking but it's honestly because I just enjoy my life so much more now.  Everything is so much easier and less stressful for me.  I can eat whatever I want and not gain weight I sleep good my relationships with family are better my anxiety is almost non existent and I'm sure plenty more positives...Had you asked me before I turned yellow I would have no desire to quit.  I was afraid if I ever got the good news I would return to it.  I did and I want nothing to do with that shit.  I needed to get the shit scared out of me to finally quit.  And to those of you who are still struggling with drinking I hope you can get through it without going through any health scares but it was dam hard for me to be motivated until I actually saw the damage I was doing to myself.  ..I wish everyone the best I enjoy this community and you guys are definitely play a part in me staying sober this long as well.
