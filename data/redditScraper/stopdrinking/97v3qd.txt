I never thought I'd actually get here. Last time I relapsed on day 59. I'm so thankful. I feel so much better than I did 60 days ago. The cravings are no longer beating me over the head 24/7. I feel like I can finally breathe. I never want to drink again. One day at a time I'll keep doing what I've been doing for the last 60 days!
