Hi Sobernauts. I am just now leaving on a trip for work. My first relapse in February was during a work trip and my second and most recent relapse was right before (and during) a work trip. I guess it's a perfect mix of stress/pressure and environment that I struggle with. I don't have much to say. I just need to get it out. Maybe I should keep checking back here for a little accountability...Thanks for listening. I will not be drinking with you today.

Just take it one minute at a time. It seems like it would be a big accomplishment if you made it through the trip without drinking! If you want I will hold you accountable for not drinking. I'll message you if you'd like
