Hi All first off I'm not advertising for RR even if it may sound like it lol..I'm not sure how available the meetings of Refuge Recovery are in less populated area's but it is growing fast and something i would advise anyone looking for alternatives or additives to their AA program..AA works great for lots of people but i think this program will help give a legitimate alternative to those who don't find relief from the steps and find it hard to get comfortable with a lot of the ways AA works. as i have over the past 4 years in AA...Reading the Refuge Recovery book had the same effect in me as people explain the big book did for them it put my confusion into words and gave a clear path out of the suffering of the drinking. and since i had read a lot of Buddhist books in high school the information wasn't new but just applied to addiction...its a Buddhist based program based on the book written by Noah Levine (who wrote Dharma Punx) called Refuge Recovery. a lot of people do both AA and RR...if your interested in it the website is Refugerecovery.org..i hope this helps anyone looking to expand their recovery that is struggling and doesnt just sound like someone crapping on AA and trying to sell something.

I've been to a few meetings.  Hoping they start a group closer to me!  Just to add to your message there are online/phone meetings available if you visit the website. 
The book has been such a valuable tool for me. 
There are finally meetings in London and I've been attending for a few weeks. I really like it.
