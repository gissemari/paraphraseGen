Hello all!..First off I want to say thank you to all of you for your support I wouldn't have made it this far without you all.  Reading words of encouragement seeing the struggles the successes and even the occasional setback keeps me committed to my goal...I have been trying to change my focus some and re\-program my thought process along the way.  I don't want to think of this as "staying sober" or "quitting drinking"...  I want to think of it as living free of self\-destructive habits and behavior.  Alcohol abuse is only one of my many faults and although it tended to amplify my other negative traits/behavior removing alcohol from my life will not make these other things go away.....So I am five weeks down the road.  This is my first big step on a lifelong journey to be a better husband a better father a better friend and overall a better human being.  ..Thank you all for helping me stay on course!  IWNDWYT!

First off congratulations 5 weeks is a huge accomplishment! Being sober is great for your health and your own peace of mind but doing it for your family is one of the greatest gifts you can give them... good job!..I like the idea of the journey being a change in your focus. I know that for me my first few weeks were filled with thoughts of how much I missed drinking. Soon I started doing small things to occupy my time more. I started doing more with the kids picked up hobbies started listening to new music exercising and all kinds of things that my brain didn't think it had room for before. Those things are now in the forefront of my mind... my brain still thinks about drinking from time to time but it's just passing thoughts that have become easier to ignore with all the new things in my life. Changing my focus as you said...Congratulations again on the success!
Congrats! I like that you frame it as self destructive behavior I feel like this time around I am going to be able to reset the drinking but I vape a ton procrastinate and have a habit of isolating myself...Your post is a great reminder that if I don't confront those behaviors too I'm not really out of the woods.
