----------immediate responses--------

**Triumph:** I had some clear thoughts today and this week and I think I'm now ready to make some neccessary changes in life.  ..**Struggle:** Not much struggle these days apart from the usual moderation lie. I also cut deep into my finger at work so I'm on sick leave this week and I feel like I have to manage on my depression a little bit more.  ..**General Chat:** Good weather here in germany where I live /u/dancing-lobsters :) Good enough for some coffee and a little punk rock on the balcony.
**Triumph:** Started training for a super cool new role at my job. It will open so many doors for my career and I'm excited for the challenge. I love the people I work with and we're all excited to work on this together. ..**Struggle:** Started the training for the new role and it's VERY in depth stuff I have to remember. The new role doesn't come with an increase in pay but I will be having a lot more responsibilities. I'm already worried about the the stress about studying for all of the material I have to learn but I'm making good plans for organization. ..**General Chat:** We've had such a mild winter I'm just ready for spring to officially be here!
I can't believe it's been over a month since I stopped drinking. I still feel tired all the time because I don't get enough sleep but it's nice to not be hungover anymore.
**Triumph**: Celebrated my boyfriends 40th bday in style on Monday.  Three surprise meals out at his fav restaurants a massage (For both of us) and a lot of sparkle water for me...**Struggle**: Motivating myself to stop eating so much sugar.  I still want to eat ALL THE PIE ALL THE TIME...**General Chat**: A bit chilly and crisp here but makes sleeping so much better.
**Triumph:** Did everything I was supposed to do yesterday and got many hours of sleep the natural way. Don't need to do anything for 7 hours today so going to get more of that now :D..**Struggle:** In 7 hours I'm going to a weekly sign language caf  (I'm a SL student) where I'll be surrounded by beer. But I'm well prepared...**General Chat:** Snow over here in Norway too (surprise). 3  C / 37  F and snowing which is great wheather actually. It's mild and snow is so much better than ice and freezing rain (which I'm expecting soon). Today is going to be a great day :)
Triumph: so much more organised in life.  I have sorted out my finances  have made some proper life goals that I'm working towards every day. Tried a few new things as hobbies  got in to writing again.  Just have so much energy and enthusiasm  to do stuff. ..Struggle: got to 10 days and relapsed  really disappointed  as I just didn't need to do it - had an event that was pre planned that I should've excused myself from  but my drinking brain kept pushing it out of my mind telling me it would be OK.  So I didn't cancel  went along and drank. I got straight back on the horse but those 10 days felt so hard won that it feels like I'm right  back at the bottom of the mountain.  Taking it a day at a time anyway and enjoying my new routines and tick lists. ..General chat: on annual leave from work and enjoying walking the kids to school rather than being a hungover sad mess. Normally meet my dad for beers once every few weeks also  was planned for this week but went to his house instead for a cup of tea and was really nice just to sit and talk rather than having the talking get in the way of drinking .  Who knew?! 
**Triumph:** Just finished week three of my front end web development class and I don't meant to brag but I am fucking owning it! I'm working my ass off but am learning so much and am getting such positive feedback! I'm so happy about it...**Struggle:** Work hasn't been fun lately. Like this is probably the worst week I've had since I started this job. My job is as a liaison officer which is the definition of middleman and this week has just been having one party saying the urgently need some info IMMEDIATELY and the other party (the one preparing the info) saying it isn't done and it won't be done until Thursday and ending up getting it yesterday which has severely pissed off both parties and made my life a living hell. *urgh*..**General Chat:** I don't have any snow on the ground! Though it hasn't been that warm for Melbourne summer. ..Thanks for taking over WuW /u/dancing-lobsters!!!
1.  Being able to walk into a supermarket and not freak out if I don't buy any beer or wine ..2. Waiting on my new job this summer so I'm not counting the minutes till I start..3. We just bought a new snowblower I'm torn between wanting it to snow. I can't wait to use it ... no more shoveling 
Triumph- making it to 30 days and actually feeling like a human being again this week!!..Struggle- My SO and I are still having some issues but we've been talking through them better... It's a long road to solve our many problems which is daunting. I'm also really scared of relapsing now that I have thirty days. ..General Chat- It's pouring here and supposed to storm all day!! At least it's in the sixties outside! ..
**Triumph:** My anxiety has been quite low this week and I've been able to spend a lot more time around people than usual. It feels good to socialise and make conversation and enjoy being around others...**Struggle:** My diet is still pretty poor (working on it) I'm drinking too much soda and eating too much pizza (I wrote 'eating too much beer' out first weird)...**General Chat:** I got to play with a puppy this week! Puppies are wonderful but so high in energy. It's been a good distraction.
**Triumph:** Made it through another weekend productive and sober. ..**Struggle:** Deciding when to kick smoking. I am still focused on sobriety as my only priority but I need to work exercising and quitting smoking into my new lifestyle. I'm approaching 90 days; I think I can handle opening up my priorities. ..**General Chat:** Frigid cold here isn't conducive to exercising. 
**Triumph** Started work in a new facility for a former boss. Made it past my birthday a death anniversary and an argument without really any desire to drink. ..**Struggle** Winter blues that hit me every year at this time are pretty bad since I am not self-medicating to the point of not remembering anything. ...**General Chat** Unusually warm weather here.  I have resumed custody of my ex's dog. She's so old and toothless. I think I'll keep her this time.
15 DAYS Sober got approached for a new job my dream job!! Girl came back to me got my own apartment and 3 days off smoking!!! woohoo loving this group!! I WILL NOT DRINK TODAY!!! or EVER!!
Triumph : Moods seem to be evening out. Most importantly  starting to practice acceptance in all areas.  .Struggle: accepting .General : Enjoying being siber. I am more productive. .Taking care of a toddler today. The joy of a little one. Yay.
**Triumph:** Things are good...**Struggle:** Work has been busy. Mostly kicking ass but I have had my ass kicked hard on a few things...**Chat:** My weather **is** better. Got about 20 inches at the house. Kids had a snow day yesterday and we made the biggest quinzhee since we've lived here.

**Triumph:** I've been nothing but productive lately. I have a job where you get out of it only what you put into it and I'm putting a lot into it. Self employment problems. Good shtuff. ..**Struggle:** I'm falling in love with someone who has a boyfriend. I didn't do it on purpose. Never wanted to be that guy that tries to steal someone but it's driving me crazy and I'm trying to keep my distance but it's so hard to on top of the fact that we just started working together. ..**GC:** Cold and rainy here. Better than snow in my opinion though :).
**Triumph:**  Preparing for the 4th Circuit oral argument in my lawsuit against Marshall University for anti-gay discrimination. The defendants have used low and despicable delay tactics including blatant lies to essentially shut this action down for two years - almost exactly the same amount of time I've been alcohol-free.  (Federal circuit courts do not set very many cases for argument - most are decided on the briefs.  So it's a very good sign.)  My two-year soberversary passed in December and I hardly noticed that - it feels like my expected major win and vindication before the Fourth Circuit will be my real anniversary date...**Struggle:**  Dealing with anger.  How to avoid having the justified anger about what Marshall's faculty did to me spill out into other areas.  It's a real concern for sobriety - the day they hauled me into a back room slapped a sheaf of documents in front of me containing never-before-voiced and totally-false accusations and told me that they would make sure I never received a West Virginia teaching certificate - that was the day my last and very severe binge commenced.  ..Sure I had a "right to drink" - just like I have a right to kill myself but what would that solve?  My whole sober time has been full of this same problem hanging over my head and yet somehow I've found ways to be happy and strong.  I grow...**General Chat:**  Music.  Just music.  My healthy addiction.
Triumph: My husband worked late last night. Usually I'd use that as an excuse to get bombed and pass out before he got home. Instead I lay in bed with the cats cuddled and waited up for him to say hello...Struggle: So freaking tired. Every morning is worse than the last. I'm even sleeping through the night. What gives?..General Chat: It's going to be in the 60s today and hopefully all of the snow will melt. That said I'm saying a little prayer that my basement stays dry. Happy Wednesday SD!
Triumph: I lost 5 pounds in the last two weeks and I credit avoiding alcohol. I have a bottle of champagne in my fridge unopened for 3 months and I'll take it to the next tennis championship to get it out of my life..Struggle: Had a bad day yesterday with news of $3000 car repairs needed. Said "f-it" and had two glasses of wine with dinner at restaurant. Reset my badge. That's okay. I'm learning I can really go days without alcohol. I've had a cold for the entire time since I started SD so that sucks but not really any withdrawal symptoms..Chat: going camping this weekend. It will be cold. But there will be no alcohol.
**Triumph:** Starting back school and finding out my results/plan of action tomorrow on the condition of my liver...**Struggle:** Finishing my taxes with how to to figure out "work expenses" regarding my car being a delivery driver...**General chat:** My [dogs](http://imgur.com/a/2ZSI0) are starting to shed their winter coats and it is everywhere! 
Triumph: Somehow I am writing my doctoral dissertation. It's really happening. A complete draft exists and all that's left to do is polish. I'm going to be finished writing by end end of the month and my defense is scheduled for mid-March. I even managed to apply for some jobs which in my mind is as much of a triumph as getting one of them. This time last year I had just barely quit drinking and I had no idea how I was going to make these events unfold. ..Struggle: I need more /r/alanon in my life...General: We had winter for about a week. Now it's spring again.
**Triumph**: Getting through ankle fusion surgery an emergency hospitalization and a stint in a skilled nursing facility (23 consecutive days) with my sobriety in tact...**Struggle**: The last seven weeks in a non-weight bearing cast and the lack of mobility it has caused. Due to come off next Tuesday!..**General Chat**: There was two feet of snow on the ground this time a week ago. Now it is nearly 60 with fog and the snow is fading away.
Triumph: going through the wringer the past couple of weeks and managing to stay sober. Today a very difficult personal matter was put front and center and I rather than thinking I needed a drink when I got home instead I found myself looking foward to my nightly relaxing bath...Struggle: boredom. I try to find things to do after work to avoid spending too much idle time at home before bed. When I am home lists of chores have been pretty helpful...General: preparing for a flood out in these parts! Have a nice six mile hike planned for Saturday with some friends so hoping it clears up here soon!
