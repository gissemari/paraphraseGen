...because I'M A DINO!!!..I was thinking my one year anniversary was tomorrow (and convinced myself it was due to the convenience of it falling on Election Day) but my sub flair tells me different. ..Whatever. I made it to one year!!! I never thought it was possible to make it an entire trip around the Sun without the crutch of alcohol...I made it by taking it one day at a time AA (on and off - it's not always for me) and being kind to myself. ..For the internet stranger who is struggling - know that there is support. We may not know each other IRL but please know that I'll do my best to talk and share my experience should it be helpful to you.
