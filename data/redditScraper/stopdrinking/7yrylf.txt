Hey everyone ..I disappeared for two weeks and just needed some time. I've been struggling with work and a boss that feels the need to offload a lot of work in our department during this time of year. It took me away from my running and resulted in a few really late nights trying to get website and database proposals together. Suffice it to say "It didn't kill me and I am still with the program". ..Today I resumed my running with a nice 2.727-mile run and it felt great. It was like taking a big ball of stress and seeing it melt away. A big thing I want to remember is that tough moments can be aided by things like running. I got bogged down but I made it harder on myself by dropping things that build me up. ..Anyways I will be checking in more often now and happy to say I am one month free of drinking. Happy Monday everyone and today I will not drink with you.
