I'm hoping I can post this here. I'm not sure if there's a better sub reddit to ask if so please let me know. ..I'm also posting this on a throwaway account because I (F24) don't really want my boyfriend (M25) to somehow see this and feel even worse about our situation...&amp;#x200B;..I apologize if this is kinda long. And thank you in advance for reading my novel of a post...&amp;#x200B;..My boyfriend has had a drinking problem for the last 7 years. He went through rehab and has relapsed several times since. ..From what I understand a lot of it is due to his parents having constantly shamed him for having gone to rehab for almost ruining his future by *almost* being expelled for poor grades and being too drunk to show up for class for "being weak" and for "embarrassing" the family because of this (even though according to him they made it decidedly clear to not tell anyone in the family of his drinking problem or trip to rehab). ..Another part of it was his school stresses. He went through some tough schooling in college for his degree and it was emotionally and mentally draining and he caved many times to the bottle to cope with the stress. He graduated last year and has found a very good stable job...&amp;#x200B;..I thought that that would mean that Mom and Dad would be proud of him again that the school stress has gone away and the party atmosphere of college are no longer such a constant threat to his sobriety. ..&amp;#x200B;..So anyway the issue begins when over a year ago he promised me he would always tell me about his urge to drink and/or when he does decide to drink. I'm aware I cannot actually stop him from doing it but I want the chance to at least be there to support him and talk him down through stress and out of drinking if it's at all possible. ..In the last year I would occasionally ask how he is doing with his sobriety whether he has visited an AA meeting lately and whatnot. I always try to keep it casual and non-confrontational as I've come to understand he is very deeply ashamed to talk about it and I've always tried to make sure he understands I only ask out of care and not judgement or disappointment. Also we've been together for 3 years now and I feel like if I'm going to support him and try to help keep him stable I feel somewhat entitled to check in on him on occasion and stay aware of his disposition. I also expect him to be honest with me about it. Up to this point he has always told me he's held strong and that he's been doing well with it and hasn't felt any strong urges to fight off. So I believed him and was proud of him for having been sober for about a year and a half. ..Turns out he has been lying to me the whole time and just decided to keep all his stresses bottled up and his drinking habit away from me for the last 3 years and never once told me about his many relapses in the last year and a half...I'm hurt and bothered by the fact that he has done this. We've otherwise had an open and trusting relationship. ..So when I confronted him about his lying to me about it he told me he just has a very hard time trusting anyone with knowing about his drinking habits and decided to keep his struggles to himself and because he doesn't want to worry me or disappoint me. He has expressed that his parents have made it very hard for him to talk about it because they've shamed him into silence to keep the family image clean. \*insert eyeroll\*..I've made it very clear to him that if he wants me to stick around through this that I need transparency and that I will not put up with secrets and lies regarding something that can be potentially destructive in our future family or in our life together. He apologized and told me that he understands this and wants to make things right so we can start fresh and that he will give me the transparency with his drinking that I am needing...This man and I have talked about marriage and children and building a life together in the future and I'm worried about him keeping secrets from me about how bad his problem is and how hard he's fighting and then one day suddenly things come crashing down out of nowhere on us because he was too afraid to let me know about it or accept help from anyone...&amp;#x200B;..I have never experienced having to help someone with an addiction. I don't have anyone in my life that has either. ..(So please forgive me if I have said anything naive about alcohol addiction in my post.)..I genuinely just don't know much about how it is for someone going through this...&amp;#x200B;..So I have read up on forums and first-hand testimonies of peoples' struggles with it so that I might be able to better understand what he's going through.  I have been truly trying my best to make him comfortable talking to me about it and to make sure he knows that he is safe from judgement with me and that I will do everything I can to provide help and support for him. But I can only do so much and being dishonest about it is no help to either of us and is not something that's gonna fly in this relationship. I am trying to make the best judgments on how to talk to him and how to support him through this and don't know what else I can do. I'm not sure if I can do something or can *stop* doing something that will help this...**My question is:** How can I support my boyfriend without hovering and being all over him about it and help make him comfortable enough to open up to me about it? Or is this one of those situations that are out of my control and all I can do is be there and hope that he just comes around and talks with me honestly about it. ..I also appreciate ANY advice regarding being a better supporter of an addict...Thanks for giving me the time out of your day to read this &lt;3

Hi. Unfortunately we aren't really the best sub to offer you support. r/AlAnon is probably the best well-known. However other organizations may that may be able to help include  [SMART Recovery Family &amp; Friends](https://www.smartrecovery.org/family/) [HARM LESS](http://hams.cc/harm-less/) and r/scienceandkindness.
