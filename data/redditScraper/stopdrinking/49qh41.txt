Howdy folks I am just a tad late but I did not forget! How has your week been? Post your triumphs struggles and complete nonsense. ...**Triumph:** Work is real smooth recovery is going superb and I just ate butterscotch pudding for dinner two nights in a row.    ..**Struggle:** I am losing a lot of motivation. I sometimes get to sleep at 19:00 (7PM) just so I can dream - that's probably not a struggle I just like to sleep...**General Chat:** How is your week going so far? Any plans for this weekend?
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph:  50 days sober!.Struggle: Motivation not as strong as it's been.  Hanging in there. I realize every day isn't easy!.Week has been good at work so far.  Probably go to our cabin on the river this weekend. It's very peaceful there.  
Triumph I didn't drink today. I'm off to a meeting..Struggle I'm jonesing for butterscotch. (hey not scotch)..General Chat: Good weather this weekend means it's off to the marina with the other Wharf rats.
Triumph:  Hit 6 months sober this week and have been running the past two days.  Struggle:  Running the past two days (definitely out of shape).  This week has been great so far enjoying the beautiful weather and making lots of progress at work.  This weekend I'll be visiting my family and continuing to enjoy the beautiful weather.
**Triumph**: Feeling stronger in my connection to sobriety after faltering a bit the last couple of weeks..**Struggle**:  Relationship with new girlfriend is pretty intense and I'm wondering if I can hang with her moodiness yet I am so enthralled by her..**Chat**:  I have the potential to buy a house at the edge of my financial abilities in a seller's market.  Nervous about the bubble popping and home value dropping.  But have to move out of where I live and could be a good investment instead of doing more renting.  What to do?? *Pulls hair*
Better late than drunk. Sober another day. Thank all of you and thank God 
**Triumph!** I know I'm not supposed to be going to non-dry places but it's important to go out and socialize with my team after our games. So this is the second week in a row where I've been at a bar with no real temptation to drink. That being said I've turned down invites to bars where the main purpose was to drink. I know I'm not ready for that...**Struggle** My mood has been drastically different. More patience more calm happier. And then sometimes out of nowhere I'm sad. I'm lonely. What the hell brain? Those are the moments when I can hear the habit thoughts: "Just drink. You're not going to be able to do this anyways so you might as well just get shit faced and accept that you can't do anything right." ..**General Chat** I'm taking zinc to help with my sleeps. Last night lying in bed I felt like I was rocking back and forth as if I were in a canoe. Then I felt like I was getting smaller and the world was getting bigger. This used to happen a lot as a kid. I thought I was such a weirdo but I looked it up and obviously there was a reddit thread about it. Alice in Wonderland syndrome. Common in people who are prone to sleep paralysis (hi!). Weirdo brain. 
Triumph: got through two major family events where several were drinking and I had soda water.   Struggle: I have to part ways with a family member who lives on the other side of the world in a few days. Not knowing when I'll see him again. This is never easy and I'm deeply saddened by it. General chat: I've reconnected with said family member during his visit this week. It has been beyond amazing and so very precious to me. This weekend will be spent resting and preparing to return to work. Not drinking despite sadness will be difficult but I've got this!
Triumph: I'm settling into this whole post-college "real-life" thing and I think I'm starting to feel like a semi-functioning adult with the capacity to be reliable with work bills and family. Well--for the most part. Struggle: That whole post-acute withdrawal thing keeps catching me off guard. General Chat: This weekend I will try to make it out for a hike since I haven't had a chance to lately.
