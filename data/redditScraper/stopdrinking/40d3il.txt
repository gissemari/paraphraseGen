I woke up this morning in a very strange place with sweat on my skin and feelings of disgrace. I can't erase my past is this the last nightmare cold stare despair will I have time to repair all that I've hurt and all that I've done? These jailhouse windows only let in fragments of sun I'm no one in here. It's all starting to come clear do I dare set out on a new path to end this wrath of resentment and guilt. I feel like I'm starting to wilt away I have to let go of yesterday. All the games I've played and people's opinions I swayed through lies and days of hating myself. I have so many fears crammed tightly on my shelf I just wanted to be someone else. All those nights I felt so joyous and free only to realize that this was never me but I can't control this disease. I manipulate with such ease. Everything I see I try to control in an attempt to fill this gaping hole in my worn out soul through empty bottles packed bowls 28 gauge needle holes and crinkled toes of women I barely know. It's all starting to show and wear me down. There's no one here to catch my tears they just crash into the ground without making a sound because there's no one around to hear them. That's when I decided to come back around. Faith without work makes it easy to continue being a jerk responsibility so easily I shirked I can hear the alert off in the distance but I can ignore it in an instant but lately it's been coming after me like a linebacker blitzing. Fixing oneself is a daunting task to be stoic and tact to show humility and laugh off all the crass judgement at last and be who I've always wanted. To trust God and not flaunt it to move past these old haunts is to soar like an astronaut. Leaving this land hand in hand with the only man left who can save me. Like Abe Lincoln freedom from slavery and restoring my bravery and no longer living angry or playing the victim which is a serious symptom of a broken spiritual condition am I ready to listen? To the voice inside or do I run and hide until the day I die? Friends and family blaming themselves asking why I couldn't find my guide. Will they ever know how hard I tried? Or will they just remember all the lies because I had too much pride to walk in stride with how I feel inside. I can no longer deny as I sit on my bunk and cry for God's will not mine. This could be my last try one more relapse and I will surely die why? Because I couldn't surrender believing I had time for one more bender another night as the pretender. Drugs and booze are my #1 contender. It doesn't matter your gender we all feel the same the guilt the shame. So it's time to claim my life back and escape this bear trap that I call smack so I'm launching an attack and have become willing to let God watch my back and with that I Can't lose
