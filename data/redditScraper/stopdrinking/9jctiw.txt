Just feeling vulnerable this morning.  I'm glad they're both in detox and going to do another stint in rehab. I know it's always a possibility on this journey.   They were a big part of my support network and I'm already missing them.   ..No matter how much this has shaken me IWNDWYD.

Glad you're still here! My mentor relapsed after 13 years of sobriety six years into mine. It's hard- it kinda shakes your foundation you know? But that's why it's important to have a good set of people that support each other and to not rely on just one relationship to help you learn and grow. She's still out there. My mentor was also a very close friend. I want to be available to her but she doesn't want to stop right now. At some point we went from mentor/mentee to very dear friends. It breaks my heart because it was kind of like a break up. (No romantic ties- it's just a significant loss in my life) ..Anyway I'm glad you're here and that I'm here and that iwndwyt!! 
I want you to know that i think its amazing that you are still on your path. Congratulations for that! Its hard to watch someone make poor choices. You keep up the hard work hun!
