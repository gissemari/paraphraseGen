I relapse I'm sad. Devastated. My dad disowned me and I went on a bender. I need a hug

I relapsed a few times they sucked.  But getting back on the horse was my best decision.  Trust takes ages to build and can be dashed in a second but it's worth building. Keep at it we're here.
&gt;I need a hug..Er dude. 
You've posted here consider that your first step. No matter how bad it is alcohol isn't going to help. The best thing you can do right now is put yourself first and look after yourself. Hopefully you can get yourself sorted and rebuild any damaged relationships. Sending you a virtual hug!
