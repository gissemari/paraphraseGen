I've never made it this far. Ever. I remember seeing fellow redditors with anything past 10 days and scoffing. "I could never do that." And yet here I am halfway to that 30. I'm so amazed and so thankful to my higher power. ..Everyone just know it's possible. Relapse? Get up and try again. Again and again and again until you succeed. Miracles happen for me just with every next day of sobriety and a new record every time. Thank you everyone for seeing me through this journey. ..You are amazing. I love you guys.
