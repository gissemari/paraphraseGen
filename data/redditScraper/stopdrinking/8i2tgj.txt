I've been noticing lots of people celebrating milestones lately and that is fantastic.  It makes me reflect on how big of an accomplishment it has been for me in the past getting just a Day 1 under my belt.  Then those 7 day stretches sometimes 2 weeks sometimes even a month.  I remember my relapses and how a drink or two in moderation would turn into a binge that could last weeks.  I would struggle to get back to just one day sober for 24 hours.  So glad to be at almost 90.  I may one day try moderation again but it sure won't be any time soon.  I'm gonna ride this gravy train with biscuit wheels on a while longer.
