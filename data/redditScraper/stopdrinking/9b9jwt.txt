Thanks to all for the advice &amp; support yesterday. I'm feeling much better &amp; hydrated today. ..I have an interview this morning which I am looking forward to very much. I've been struggling pretty hard the past 8 months or so and this could be an excellent opportunity. Just goes to show what motivation and a clear(er) head can do...Still struggling with bouts of anxiety &amp; sadness but you folks here and my friends offline have been an excellent support group. My neighbor came over for a visit yesterday and was kind enough to ask if I minded if he had a beer or two which I did and do not. I won't be evangelical about my sobriety and my problems are not someone else's. It felt great knowing that I can still be around drinking and still stay sober. My desire to drink isn't going away but I feel like I'm getting stronger to where I can fight that urge...I will not drink with you today...&amp;#x200B;
