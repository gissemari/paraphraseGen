Hey all - long time lurker first-time poster. You all have been a tremendous help to me in my quest to maintain my sobriety. 200 days ago I went overboard at a holiday party after going overboard 3-5 times a week (depending on the week) for the 15ish years leading up to that holiday party. I'm a binge drinker by nature I'm a binge person by nature actually. I have an all or nothing mentality that my wife describes as a  blessing and a curse . It's good for the good things and horrible for the bad things. Finding balance has always been a struggle but I'm inching closer and closer to it with each new day of sobriety so just wanted to pop in to thank you all for helping me work towards that. Reading your stories every night before bed has been a big driver for me.

Congratulations!  
Well done!  Do you follow any programs or routines that have worked for you other than lurking in here?
I can totally relate. I'm a binge person by nature and I actually never really thought of that. I have the all or nothing thinking when it comes to everything and I guess that's just who I am. I'll either do it obsessively or not so it at all in almost every aspect of my life. Balance is hard. How are you working on your balance?  
Congrats!
