Last night at my 4th meeting in 3 days I was introduced to the term "white knuckle."  The topic of the night was relapsing and one of the guys talked about how he could stay sober well enough for a while with willpower but it wasn't until he started to seek growth in his sobriety that it finally started to stick and make sense.  ..It became clear to me that there is lots of work and growing to do for me now.  It's not about JUST staying sober it's about learning and growing with that sober mind to achieve the inner peace and balance I was searching for so hard with booze. ..Peace and balance; I'll take a little of that over a bottle of whiskey any day.  This is my first taste of hope...Thank you all for being here at this important time in my life.

Perfect!!!! Good observation. I say all the time sobriety is 10%not drinking and 90% learning how to live sober.
