I've been doing really well! Sometimes I even forget about alcohol and its temptations. During moments like that I forget how much of a struggle I have had with this and the people that helped me through it.    So I'm taking a moment to step back and appreciate how wonderful this community is. Thank you all so very much.    .    [E-hug!](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mb0nmp7nxi1r5e2tqo1_400.gif)
