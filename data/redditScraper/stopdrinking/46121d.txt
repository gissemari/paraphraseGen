Hello Friends..I was what I thought at the time a functioning alcoholic. I believe since I was 20~. .Since that time I've left a trail of pain and damages both physical mental and emotional in my wake. ..The laundry list is as follows that I can recall. .Lost 5 jobs..Hurt close friends..- due to drinking job 1 was lost and I was also the ride that best friend and roommate depended on. ..- slept with a girl that same friend liked but she didn't like him. ..- job 2 I was given a 2nd chance and f'ed that up. ..- mean while my family life was plummeting fast. All trust with my wife was gone. ..- She started to loose meaning of our relationship. ..- job 3 I would disappear from work to drink in a parking lot. That caught up with me fast. ..- I hurt my family by drinking and passing out while I was the only person watching my children. ..Presently my wife wants a separation although we still live in the same house. I only have the children overnights if she isn't working ( night shift ). ..The "Come to Jesus" moment was on January 18th 2016. I was on day 3 of a bender. I went to work but drank and pass out in the parking lot. ..On my way home from that I ran a red light and totaled my car in a almost head on collision. ..I'm not very religious but something was watching over me. The other person wasn't hurt. I was ok as well. ..The cop that came had me call someone to pick me up (parents) and only sited me for running the light. ..------------..Now for the good news since. ..- I was able to get a new car. ..- I have started a new job. ..- my depression meds are working better than ever. ..- I feel like it's still a long road to recover what I've lost but I know how and what I have. ..- there isn't a control for me with drinking. ..I've looked back at everything that has been f'ed up in my life and 90% has been due to drinking. ..I not going to forget my mistakes or wish them away...I have come to accept them as the last and each day is what I make it. ..I feel better and clearer than I've been in a long while. ..SO HERES TO 30 DAYS!!!..Thank you for reading!.......
