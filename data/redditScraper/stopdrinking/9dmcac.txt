As many of you may know Dolores the lead singer of the Cranberries passed away a few months ago. The results of her inquest were released today. It's appears that her death was an accident caused by alcohol. It's a truly horrible and sad story. I think back on my own history and think about how many times I may have cheated death without realizing.  There is a tendency to say oh I don't drink as much as x y z but the reality is that even a few risks impairs our judgement and can cause accidents as simple as falling down the stairs or running across a road thinking we are faster than we think.  I guess this is another reason to stop drinking. I had a lot of accidents when I was drunk at the time they were freak accidents but when I look back now they weren't accidents they were the result of too many drinks. Dolores like the rest of us here have struggled with alcohol but we should all learn the lesson. RIP Dolores iwndwyt

When I think back over my life there were many times when I was saved from something bad happening to me while drinking. I can only think that it was my higher power telling me I had work to do.
When I read this one of my first thoughts was about all the times I would get drunk and sit in the hot tub after my wife went to bed. Compared to everything else I did it seemed like nothing but I suppose anything you do while drinking can turn ugly quickly. IWNDWYT.
