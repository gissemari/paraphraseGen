I used to go to therapy and alcohol support groups in college (I almost forgot) so clearly this struggle with alcohol has gone on for a long time for me. So much mental anguish and energy trying to moderate or feeling like shit in the mornings and every day for being so much less than I could be... all because of an unhealthy relationship with booze... which I only recently learned is just straight up addictive (read: NOT A CHARACTER FLAW OF MINE)...And only now I FINALLY (15+ years later) feel comfortable with my relationship with alcohol... and that's because I'm done with it. Life is infinitely better... and keeps getting better... now that I've eliminated a huge drain on my life. I have more mental energy resilience strength have lost 15 pounds am a better mother and am also now focused on general wellness and self-improvement. I guess I'm making up for the last 15 years... but am NOT looking back.

Atta girl!!!..[Congrats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT94urc-MVw) on **6** months!!!.
I can totally relate.  It's surprising to me how simple the solution ultimately was. And how much effort I put into fighting it for years.  I was convinced that life without alcohol would just be *less*.  I didn't want to *have to* stop drinking.  Who knew it was the other way around?  What?  It's great.  Good job on a better life well earned.  You're doing a wonderful thing. 
Congratulations...This is inspiring! 
Love it!! keep moving forward!! you inspire me!
Well done!
