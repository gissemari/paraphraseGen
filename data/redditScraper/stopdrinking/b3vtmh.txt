I went out and  bought some cheap vodka this week and finished it off last night. The withdrawal is pretty bad right now. Been vomiting all day even just water. I'm dizzy breathing heavily because I feel like I can't get enough air and my heart feels like it's going to burst out of my chest. If this happens again I'm afraid I might end up accidentally killing myself. This isn't worth it.
