I read a lot of SD posts that I don't comment on and it usually comes down to "If you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all." There are a number of reasons I have a negative reaction to posts: they're just feeling sorry for themselves and not doing anything to help themselves they decided to drink and brought a world of trouble upon themselves they went to a bar/party and relapsed... I get it we all have to make our own mistakes and/or sometimes we are just feeling blue and they've come here for support...However today I read a post from someone who (in their title) doesn't want to quit drinking and came to share why. Really? You posted in Stop Drinking why you don't want to stop drinking? If you want to throw your life away being drunk go ahead but don't come here and tell me why it's so fun and enjoyable for you. There are some good times that I miss having but I'm sick and tired of the swath of destruction that drinking left in my life and the lives of my loved ones so I had to quit. You get it? I **had** to quit drinking even though it's all I *wanted* to do from the moment I woke up to whenever I passed out blacked-out...The other posts that infuriate me are the "successful moderation" posts. Are you able to successfully moderate? Congratulations - you're not an alcoholic so please don't come here and tell me about how fucking great it is to not have this profound problem. Do you also go to infertility subs and talk about how great it is to be a parent? Do you post about your love of eating ice cream in weight loss subs? Then please don't come here and shit on a problem I've struggled with for decades and will never be done with...It's irresponsible to come here where people are fighting for their lives and write about how you don't want to quit drinking or how you used to have a problem but have learned to control it. The name of the place is **"Stop Drinking"** so please take a fucking note and act accordingly...Christ and don't get me started on people downvoting my anti pro-drinking reply...tl;dr: Drinking is bad total abstinence is key. You can do it we want to help. I love you you beautiful broken-like-me bastards!..**Note**: I want to thank each and every person who commented here. You've helped me remember when I was one of those "moderation" guys back before the Internet. Going through the moderation phase is an important part of the recovery process. As /u/offtherocks pointed out it's how alcoholics find out they're alcoholics who cannot moderate their drinking. For those who are "successfully" moderating you're either not an alcoholic or the wheels simply haven't come off yet and you just like I did have to find out for yourself and I respect that.
----------immediate responses--------

Erm whoa! Are you having a bad day? I love this place because it's a place of acceptance encouragement and support and this this is definitely none of those things! I get where you're coming from but man don't you think you're being just a little too harsh? We are all in the same boat here we are all struggling and everyone gets to their destination in their own way. People fight this disease hard every day and sometimes unsuccessfully we fall down many many times before we are able to get up and stay up and this is just...I can't help but feel that it is totally unproductive and moreover really shitty to put other people down on how they deal with their issues. Each to their own. If you had read that post the one where the OP is talking about not wanting to give up - in the same sentence he is saying that he knows he needs to! Well shit like you yourself say we have all been there it just so happens he is just begging to realise it perhaps. Or perhaps not - but who are you to shit on him from such a great height?! I really don't think it's our place to judge anyone given our own struggles. And with regard to successful moderation - same thing. Many people struggle to comprehend that this is forever they need to take it one day at a time or tell themselves that perhaps in a few years' time they might be able to do it. Some people think they are moderating successfully and post about it and then it escalates and they relapse - and fuck that must be painful and suck for them. Where's your compassion. I have never ever posted anything negative on here and I really don't mean to tell you how to feel or what to think - as I said each to their own and I even understand and appreciate a lot of your sentiments - but I can't help but feel that your delivery of said sentiments sucks a lot of ass. Peace out and congrats on 160 days that's massive. 
I understand your frustration but getting sober is a journey. Many people here are on the path but not quite ready. They might be at the stage where they want to want to quit. Maybe they're experimenting with moderation so they can learn firsthand whether or not they need to stop entirely. (Didn't us quitters try the same thing before coming to the conclusion that abstinence was the solution for us?) As the sidebar states they are welcome here.
Yeah some guy said he didn't want to stop drinking..It wasn't exactly a news flash haha...And off therocks did a fair enough analysis on the guy who claimed successful moderation...All in all those situations seem fairly rare on this sub...But OK I hear your rant. Glad you got it out of your system;)
Everyone is on their own journey. I bet some people are pissed off by your post. ..The joys of adult life eh??
I focus on myself and my own sobriety not others and look to give advice where I can.  But let's face it it's also not appropriate to come here and tell people what they should or shouldn't do. 
Yes I gave your first comment a downvote mostly for lack of compassion I think. The OP wasn't glorifying drinking. He stated he doesn't want to quit but is recognizing that it's very likely he'll need to. It seems to me he wanted to start a dialogue by saying here this is where I am talk to me. Again we all start somewhere. ..Note I didn't downvote your second comment despite its snarkiness ;). I figured maybe you're maybe having a less then perfect day and probably don't need some internet stranger prickling your sore spots. Can we just hug it out :D
I look at that post as someone who was looking for a nudge in the sober direction. He definitely thought of quitting as he had at least went to a meeting and is reading SD...My own related story is the many hours I spent talking to a good friend who beat me to sobriety by a decade. He would patiently listen and tell me his thoughts never be judgemental and tell me I would and could do it too when I was ready. Even though I only had the courage to talk to him about getting sober while drunk. 
I always think that people post here for a reason and the reason may not be what they're saying it is and they may not be aware of it themselves. ..In behavior change theory the first stage is "pre-contemplation." That stage is when stuff is bad but we haven't really put together all the facts about the risks we're facing. Just showing up here and making a post (unless it's just a troll) is doing *something*--even if the post seems misguided or naive. It means someone's questioning themselves at some level and in some way grappling with their own resistance. Getting information. Throwing something out there and getting feedback. I think that's useful and part of the process. And the paths are different and what seems obvious at 160 days might not be at day 6. ..I get it though. When the patterns become repetitive and I find myself getting jaded--I take a break. I go away and come back another day. ..Now I will get off your lawn...
I hope you are feeling less angry. I'm proud of your 160 days I hope the spring will be here when I hit 160!
&gt; It's irresponsible to come here where people are fighting for their lives and write about how you don't want to quit drinking or how you used to have a problem but have learned to control it. The name of the place is "Stop Drinking" so please take a fucking note and act accordingly...It's not though.  Name notwithstanding it says right in the sidebar:..&gt; This reddit is a place for redditors to motivate each other to control or stop drinking...I understand that some people disagree with that approach but SD has been like this since day #1.  The model has served us well...You've got to understand that "trying to moderate" is a step along the path to a person admitting to themselves that they can't drink in moderation.  We've all tried it.  Most of us can't do it. But we've all tried...If there are people out there who can moderate their drinking at that stage of the game they look *exactly like someone who can't moderate their drinking.*  The groups look 100% identical...One of the strengths of the SD model over the years has been that those looking to moderate their drinking come here and they read stories about moderation-fails from others.  No one can convince another person that they cannot drink in moderation.  It's a decision people have to arrive at on their own.  By being here that person has the opportunity to read stories from others who learned that they couldn't do it.  Because we all talk about our own experience that person is then free to find the similarities on her/his own.  By being exposed to sober culture the person is more likely to come to that decision to quit sooner rather than later...(This is incidentally the real strength of Saturday Shares.  It only takes one story that really "speaks" to you. So the more we have the better.  You'll note that AA people often had a favorite personal story from the back of the BB.  They'll say "When I read the one by X I saw that he was telling my story!"  Same thing happens with Saturday Shares.  The more we have the better.  We need to give people as many opportunities as we can to find those similarities themselves.)...I can name at least 100 people who showed up here looking to moderate but eventually discovered that it wouldn't be possible for them.   Just off the top of my head raevie is one of those people.  Here is a post from her [from way back in 2011.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ml1qj/controlled_drinking_experiment/)  I know urbanrunnner mentioned just the other day that he too was one of those people.  There are lot of them out there...We don't like to see posts from people *glorifying* drinking in any way but very few of the moderation posts do that.  On the contrary about the half the time those folks first shoot us a modmail and as if it would be OK to post that.  "I really don't want to hurt this community do you think post would be OK?..Remember everyone who quits drinking is subject to peer pressure in their real life.  They're gonna be out &amp; about and their friends area gonna say *Ah just one won't kill ya!*  That is the biggest struggle that most of the newly sober have.  Where is the better place for that person to explore that issue?  Here on SD where 20 people chime in to say "didn't work me" or out with their friends where 20 people are saying *aaahhhh come on have just one?*..Also keep in mind that the AA Big Book (not that this is AA I'm only citing this to show that it's not exactly a revolutionary concept) states that someone who isn't sure should (paraphrased) *Step over to the nearest watering hole start drinking then stop abruptly.  Do it more than once.  If you're honest with yourself it shouldn't take too long to discover which class you belong in.*..Trying to control drinking is a step along the path to complete abstinence for everyone who adopts total abstinence.  And for people who are actually capable of moderating hey good for them.  If they can learn something here I say more power to em.  ..This issue has been contentious on SD since SD's inception.  You're not the first to dislike that aspect of SD.  But it's served us very well over these past 4 years.  Many people stopped drinking sooner rather than later just by being exposed to sober culture.  They see for themselves that they have a lot in common with those who can't drink in moderation. And they see that being sober ain't all that bad.  It helps people quit earlier.  ....
I hope your post let you release some steam. ..I don't necessarily agree or disagree with you but I can see your point of view. You're doing great to have almost a half a year under your belt! ..Keep it up and maybe try to not focus too much on others/Internet. At the end of the day we all know how much of a personal battle this is and I wouldn't like to see you let anything distract you from that fact. ..Keep on fightin'
Well this is still the internet. Some people *are* trolling when they post stuff like that just as you have parents posting pity notes to childless or childfree forums and "suck it up fatties I eat ice cream every night and I'm still skinny" shitposts to weight loss forums. ..But as others have said lots of times people are just working through stuff on their way to hitting rock bottom. I could have made some of the posts that you're complaining about at different points in my sobriety journey which includes the points at which I wasn't sober and desperately trying to rationalize it. As I've said before I really look at this as /r/stopdrinking and not /r/moderatedrinking so I don't think that those posts have a place here but I totally get that someone is trying to kid themselves the way that I tried to kid myself. I think that it's *Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions* that says to people who think that they can moderate their drinking why don't you go ahead and try it keeping in mind what we've told you about our own stories? (Also there's a subreddit for people who are drinking and know that they're in trouble and want to sort of revel in it but I don't remember the name and don't care to bother to look it up.) 
Feel free to ignore me I just lapsed a few days ago...20% of my city binge drinks on a regular basis.  Statistically only 8% of the population are alcoholics.  That 12% should probably learn to moderate.  One of the few ways to diagnose an alcoholic (the 8%) is attempting to moderate repeatedly and failing. ..Even the big book makes the distinction between heavy drinkers and alcoholics.  Do you think those heavy drinkers should keep it up? Thousands and thousands of lives would be saved by people who are not alcoholics moderating...If you don't believe me believe the [CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2014/14_0329.htm)...

I love you
Anything that can inspire such anger in you is a gift from the cosmos an opportunity to at least *try* to practise equanimity one breath at a time; this will serve your recovery much better than kicking off. Much much easier said than done. Take care.
i like it
Dont dump your garbage on other people..
&gt; I read a lot of SD posts that I don't comment on and it usually comes down to "If you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all."..I have written long comments only to erase them and leave. For me I want to be as helpful as I can. If I read my comment over before posting and it doesn't seem helpful it gets deleted. That is my only rule...Calling people out on their shit can be helpful in 100% of the situations where people are not being honest with themselves. ..With that being said there is a right and wrong way to do that. If you say "You're not being honest with yourself" that can be a little harsh and they may try and guard against it. If you say "When I was feeling the way you are feeling and doing the thing that you are doing now I realized that I wasn't being honest with myself." What I am doing in the latter example is allowing the person to come to the conclusion about themselves vs. me telling them like it is. ..Keep up the good work. 6 months is looking really close for you!
To think - all the time spent reading and writing this thread was time NOT spent drinking.   Seems like a win in my book
If you like drinking just do so sometimes and don't go overboard too often. It's not that hard. You're basically just mad at yourself for having no self-control.
