This is the longest I have gone without drinking in probably well over a year. I honestly can't even begin to understand how I pulled it off but I want to thank every single one of you who post here for being open about your struggles and helping a guy not feel so alone.

That is the truth mattsauce we are not alone in this struggle. I'm so happy to read your celebration of 4 weeks and /u/Susantown's 2 months before I turn out the light and go to sleep. ..Way to go! Keep on keeping on! 
Congrats!! 4 weeks is a very cool badge milestone because you get a new number and then in two days you hit one month and get a new badge again! :D..Have there been any positive changes you wanna share? I bet you've noticed some good things.
You're the f-ing MAN!
