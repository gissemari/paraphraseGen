Quick disclaimer.  If you are getting results from abstinence Allen Carr's book AA or any method other than Naltrexone please don't read any further due to possible trigger material.  ..Hi all quick summary and facts only.  I have struggled with alcoholism since 24.  I'm over 35 now.  I've tried willpower and read Allen Carrs' book several times.  My first time reading Allen Carr I quit for 30 days but slowly got started again.  ..I read about Naltrexone and the Sinclair method on this subreddit about four months ago  I decided to get Dr. David Sinclairs' book and a script for 50mg Naltrexone and have had very positive results.  ..This method has worked so well that I am frustrated that I spent so many years of my life my health and my youth without this method when it has been available since the 1990's.  At this point I look about 10 or 15 years older than I really am and I wish I new about this method back when it could have helped out with that.  At least now I can salvage my blood pressure cholesterol and what's left of my marriage.  I guess I'm luckier than many people. ..My goal is total abstinence but since that has been so difficult I'm looking to adhere to the Sinclair method until I can quit.  My drinking is currently down about 90% and hopefully I can get the last 10% over the next year.  ..If you've got any questions hit me up...

No questions just confirmation.  I started on 50mg of Naltrexone a night about 5 months ago.  I've gone from 4-7 drinks a night to one ... maybe.  Some nights I don't even have that. Keep on keepin on..
In my experience Naltrexone works best in combination with a recovery program where sober living skills are learned.
