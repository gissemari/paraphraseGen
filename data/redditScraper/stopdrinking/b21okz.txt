I'm 25 days without a drink.  However about every night of those days I dreamt about drinking.  I want to dream about something other than trying to always find a drink or struggle to drink in my dreams. In these dreams I drink vodka or walk around in a store trying to locate it without ever finding any which frustrates me to no end.... Until I wake up without a hangover and am relieved that I never gave in to the bottle in real life and disappointed my wife all over again one more time.  Thank goodness a lot of dreams don't come true.  Anyone else have drinking dreams all the time and are getting tired of not dreaming about anything else?  How long is it gonna last?  In real daily life im not thinking about it all the time like I was early on or in the midst of the daily drinking.

Oh wow that sounds terrible! I have them occasionally but we're talking every few weeks not every day. They're terrible so I really feel for you.
It wasn't until my 40th day that I finally stopped dreaming about drinking.  Until then I would be at parties or festivals and jonesing for beer.  It was just like real life - the way I would feel when I was drinking.  I would even have a full beer in my hand and be thinking about the next one.  Thankfully that part of my dream self has quieted down.  On the 40th night I had a dream where a friend offered me a beer at a party and I declined it!  Wow that was a powerful moment!!  Really helped give me resolve in my waking life.  That was only a few days ago but it feels substantial to me.  Hang in there!
