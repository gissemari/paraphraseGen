I'm trying to stop. But I struggle! I used to be Mr fitness and I miss the old me. Now I just get bored and drink. I hate it! It causes me problems and depression! I have fun while drinking but I just feel so bad about myself because I continue to back slide.

Welcome glad you're here! Something I'm learning (the hard way maybe) is that feeling bad about ourselves for backsliding has never helped any of us move forward. So remember that today is another day that you can take control of things and turn them around...Maybe look up some 10-15 minute exercise programs on YouTube that you can do just whenever you feel the urge to drink? I've been meaning to do that. I've been finding out in the last few weeks that even just adding a 15 min walk to my day (I have health problems and get little to no exercise otherwise) has been dropping the pounds! Baby steps.   I will gladly not drink with you today!
