I've lurked here for a bit. Posted once before the first time I tried to get myself off the snake juice did good for a week before going back to it. Fast forward months later and I had a pretty bad weekend of drinking (drank with friends went home to drink alone some more) felt like shit. Figured this would be good opportunity to wean myself off....So last night I sat around watching my shows and playing some games doing my best to not think about drinking. It wasn't until mid night 3 hours after my usual drinking time that I started to feel anxious and irritated. Eventually I caved in and had a drink and then another. I believe it was just two drinks worth of vodka and I was already feeling hammered which was very odd since it usually takes much more before I feel anything. ...I was just watching a show when suddenly my heart rate started going through the roof. I was like "Okay... this has happened before... just relax and it'll go away." Then my hearing started going out....What the shit man....I suddenly had trouble hearing the show I was watching. This was around 1 AM. I went out of my room to take a piss. This was a difficult task. As I did my business my hearing worsened even more and I was getting really disoriented. I finished and threw my ass into bed hoping to just pass out and let the carnage go away. As I was getting myself settled under my sheets I noticed that I couldn't hear the rustling of them. All I could hear was my heart beat which was getting increasingly louder....This was quite new to me so I was just freaking out when I couldn't hear anything but my heartbeat. I must have been in a daze or had fallen asleep because I don't remember anything from then til 4 AM. I woke up completely sober feeling irritated sweating and just couldn't fall back to sleep for the life of me. ...Now I'm sitting here feeling really sleep deprived clammy and cold from all the unnecessary sweating. I'm really getting fed up with my drinking. This has been a great year for me in terms work of experience and general progress in life all except the fact that I have been heavily drinking for the past year since the time I managed to quit for a week....My friend's all think I've broken out of my shell done away with all my alcoholic habits but in truth I've only just gotten better at hiding it. I may look great on the outside but on the inside it's still a struggle......Well I'm hoping my fatigue from today will allow me to just fall asleep tonight without having to deal with insomnia... From what I remember the first few nights blew ass. Good luck to all those of you trying to quit as well.

Do you still have booze in the house?  If so GET RID OF IT.  ..You know you don't have to go withdrawals on your own; you can go to the doc and they can prescribe you meds to make process safer and more comfortable.  What you went through last night sounds like it could have ended much worse than what it did.   ..I'm a pick apart sentences and words type of person because I think you can see a lot there that you might not realize is there.  Your title is "I **think** I'm done."  You said "I'm really **getting** fed up with my drinking."  That doesn't equate you ARE fed up with your drinking and you want to quit.  If you really don't want to quit and aren't ready what's the point of putting yourself through this?  My apologies if I am out of line but that's just what I'm reading from your post.  ..If you truly are ready to quit and you really do want to have a better life for yourself we will be here for you every step of the way.  Do you have any plans in place as far as recovery?  Meetings? Therapy?
