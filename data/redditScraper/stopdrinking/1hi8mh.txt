**TL;DR: Is there any science about a magical 90 difference? There's got to be. Things are much more....normal....than they have been. How was your 90 day mark? Do you tend to relapse near the days you get chips?** ..Your stories and the ways you got through these times (with or without staying sober) would really help me right now...I've made a few posts here and there about my sobriety:..[Dating during sobriety and my poly lifestyle](http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1dmo5c/sobrietyrecovery_polyamory/). As a note my partner and I have decided it would be best for me to close my side of the relationship and avoid seeking other partners. We have decided that both sexual play or kink play would be ok but that hasn't really happened. (except for a [spanking party](http://www.reddit.com/r/Spanking/comments/1gdolc/so_i_am_going_to_a_spanking_party_tonight/)..[Halfway through my 90 day goal I had a breakthrough thought](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1er0dq/45_days/)..[A day recently where I was seriously considering going out for a drink but decided to get validation by wallowing here instead.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1h6m55/i_want_to_drink/)..If things are going ok why am I posting here? Well because....things aren't going that well especially in my head. I'm able to put on a brave front to help people but not for long and it takes a huge toll. So here I am. Please help me help myself or at least help me find the chat useful...I do have an appointment with a therapist i've never seen before on wednesday tomorrow. I'm not sure how to talk to her about this or even where to start...Two days ago I went up and down the street fully intending to buy booze before a massage. I also intended not to tell my partner about it. I'm glad i didn't find any...Yesterday I tried to break up with my partner. **The sex has sucked lately! My interest just isn't there and I can't feel the same pleasure at all!** In addition I have been picking fights with my partner for mostly unknown reasons...I nearly tried to sleep on the streets last night but instead i woke up reached an arm out and my warm fuzzy lovable partner was there. Before I was even actually awake we were snuggling. We talked for a bit about how I was so afraid and he brought up (I'd been thinking this for a bit) how 90 days seems to be an actual thing **physically and emotionally**. I am afraid. My body is afraid. We have no idea what's coming next but for right now I need to stay sober...Today I've found myself shaking anxious needy. I called my partner home from work with tears and threats. I wanted him to open the safe and give me nitrious. I don't know what i'm afraid of...90 days seems to be a huge thing for me...One part of this is that my body seems to be making its final adjustments. **(specific sex stuff below don't read if you don't want to know. I am female.)**..>*After two or three months of not being able to get wet and only being able to have one orgasm if that my body seems to have accepted the no-booze state of affairs. I have been able to self lubricate increasingly well for the past few days my sex drive is returning to normal and I can go back to having many orgasms!*..**back to the drinking stuff**..so this morning was great. comfy cozy good times. good talks good feels. then he left and 5 minutes later i'm freaking the fuck out. idek. I guess i'm going to another smart meeting tonight. **If anyone feels like encouraging me to do some worksheets for smart that would get me motivated. I tend to take care of my own recovery best when I feel as though I can be a role model. If someone asks I will jump on doing a worksheet right away and post my results here.**..I scanned in all the worksheets at the back of the new workbook. they are:..*Hierarchy of values..*Urge Log ([described here](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1h6m55/i_want_to_drink/carlxc5))..*Weekly Planner..*ABC's (i can post what that worksheet is if anyone's interested)..*Disputing irrational Beliefs..*Lifestyle Balance Pie (Ties in with the hierarchy of values. My facilitator recommended this it doesn't translate into text well but i'll do what i can...if there's enough interest i can recreate it in some basic program.)..*Goal setting...**in brief**..Relapse behavior is ongoing though I haven't succumbed to my desires yet. .I'm fighting with my support I'm not getting stuff done and I'm seeking some kind of high any high. .SMART worksheets usually help me but I don't want to do one. If you tell me to do one then I will.

&gt;Two days ago I went up and down the street fully intending to buy booze before a massage. I also intended not to tell my partner about it. I'm glad i didn't find any...This is serious relapse behaviour. What's going on?
What is bothering you the most?
This sounds extremely intense I've no idea how you must be feeling. There seems to be a lot going on in your head a lot of worrying. Is there any worksheets for working through problems or working out what is bothering you the most? ..Treat yourself to some ice cream or something nice good luck :) 
Sounds like some ripe areas for doing ABCs.  I'd start with what got you walking down the street looking for booze and what kept you from doing it.  If you've not done the HOV I'd do that first.  If you have take it out and look at it again.  Tweak if necessary.
