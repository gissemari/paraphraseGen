The hardest part about coming back after relapsing is getting over my pride and admitting I messed up. I should not have relapsed. My life got worse. Nothing was gained.

Welcome back.  Glad you are here. 
Relapses are never fun and it is definitely difficult to come back and admit defeat. But you came back and that's something to be thankful for. we all still love you even if you did slip up none of us are perfect
Alcohol is easy to quit; I've done it dozens of times.
Welcome back. 
You know how good life can get when you are sober Its much nicer on this side.
