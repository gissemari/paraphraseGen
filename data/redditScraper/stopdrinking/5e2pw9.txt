I was thinking the other day that at about three weeks the acute struggle was behind me and I could see how easy it is to forget why not to drink. ..As I have posted before nothing terrible will happen if I drink. I wasn't an obvious train wreck when I drank. It just made me fat and only I knew that my thoughts about drinking were disordered. (I would "drink moderately all the time" if you know what I mean.)..Weight loss has been my primary motivation the one solid non-fuzzy reason for not drinking. Last week I  went away for over a week and was disappointed not to have lost more weight during that time in spite of not compensating with sweets and going to the gym most days. (I lost an inch off my waist but no pounds on the scale). ..Now I'm away again. This time I am in Edinburgh for the first time. Edinburgh in the winter is dark and romantic and mysterious. And its steep streets and narrow passages are dotted with  the glow of beautiful pubs. These pubs seem to promise something but I don't know what it is exactly. I guess they seem to say "Come in here where it's warm. Discover the architectural quirks of this old building and quaint interior. Find out what's on tap - not just Carling and Stella... there's something new from the continent and craft microbrews and beautiful ruby red wines that catch the light. Stop walking around aimlessly  looking at the cold outsides of buildings. Sit down in the glow and be on the inside where nobody is bored or alone." ..I can go in them of course. But the food is probably rubbish and anyway I'm not hungry. Nor am I particularly thirsty at the moment. I have no reason to go inside. I have no real reason to go anywhere except maybe to the gym or back to the hotel. Is there nothing to do except wandering around punctuated by spending money on things I probably don't need? ..

What about some photography? It's my go to when alone in a new city and not drinking. Not that often I will admit (I was normally in a pub trying to pretend I wasn't lonely) but I find it adds some purpose to the wandering. ..Good luck but sounds like you've got this :)
