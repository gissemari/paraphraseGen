I couldn't sleep last night and actually got out of bed to walk down the street to get a pint of vodka so I could rest. I quit for 6 months and relapsed about 3 weeks ago. It quickly became more and more about drinking various amounts. Sometimes I got drunk sometimes I only had 5 or 6 drinks...I don't want to do this to myself any more and trying to be a normal drinker is just not an option anymore. It's time to quit and be done 100% again. Lesson learned. Hopefully the lesson sticks this time.

Congrats friend on your rapid return. Lots have gone into a moderation attempt and very few that I know have had success. Stay strong &amp; Sober on! I will NOT drink with you today! Peace
Hello fellow day 1er. Coming down from a 3 day "I got this" binge. Nope. Normal drinking ain't working. In fact I don't think drinking is normal. I see my son experiment with his buddies from middle school and I am witnessing a transformation from gaming to drinking. Not normal but 'cool' and 'grown up.' IMO normal is a happy well adjusted adult. I am still working on it. I am staying sober with you today. Normally!
