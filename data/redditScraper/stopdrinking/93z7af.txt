I had been wanting and and anticipating my Very Important Six Month Post for a while. It's a shame that mental illness doesn't give a flying fuck what I wan't isn't it?..The day came I posted the news on social media to my friends (with amazing support and encouragement mind you) and the day ended...Nothing special. No revelations. ..Avoiding alcohol has no doubt had a tremendous impact on my life however. I went from unemployed broke and borderline homeless to now having a job in behavioral health some money saved and living with one of my best friends. I've also restored a few friendships and made a few others. I got back in shape and lost ~30 pounds as well...The somewhat morose reality though is that my mental illnesses have become worse and my treatment through medication has become all but useless. I know it's "helping" but it doesn't feel like it you know? I started actual therapy sessions about six weeks ago and those have been unbelievably helpful. ..I suffer from panic disorder clinical depression adhd and very severe derealization disorder the latter of which has more or less taken over every waking moment of my life...Alcohol used to be my grounding. My savior. Now the idea of it disgusts me. ..I now have methods of coping with these illnesses but the fight is hard. It is harder than having that final drink and it is harder than the days that follow. ..I just wanted to share with all of you - strangers of all people - that if you're battling mental illness and alcohol is your safe place (your way to cope heal calm down go to sleep etc) it does not have to be. ..I've never been to a single AA meeting. I quit cold turkey. I cannot say I was physically dependent on this substance like some or many of you were/are. But I was a daily drinker and by that I mean I had a good amount of alcohol throughout the day. Perhaps I was an emotional drinker in that it gave me temporary relief from a variety of co-occurring mental health disorders. I knew if I kept taking that first sip it would lead me to my early grave. Not through the physical deterioration of my body but through a swift first and final dive off of a nearby bridge I often walk. ..Temporary relief is just... temporary. The bad far outweighed the good and I am a logical person. I often think in black and white. If I do A (drink to cope) the result is B (feeling like shit physically on top of mentally and emotionally). So when I filled my prescription for my medications (which are now as I said failing me) I knew I had to stop. So I stopped...I'm not sure where life is taking me next. I am actually on temporary leave from work due to these mental health problems. But the problem isn't alcohol as it always was. Alcohol no longer has control of me. Alcohol is no longer my friend coping mechanism or way to 'unwind'. Alcohol is cruel and unforgiving and is quite literally the very worst thing you can consume on a regular basis as a human being...I now face my struggles with a clearer mind. My body is able to perform physical tasks and I exercise as regularly as possible. If I hadn't stopped drinking 185 days ago I can almost guarantee that I would no longer be in the world...Cheers to you all and here's a selfish blessing to myself...IWNDWYT.
----------immediate responses--------

Congrats on 6 months alcohol free!  That's wonderful.  I hope the mental health improves.  My depression and anxiety took about 8 or 9 months to improve.  I still have some but it's way better. ..Anyway good job!  IWNDWYT
