Hello.  I have a similar story.  I have relapsed a couple of times in the last two years after over three years of sobriety.  The first time that I relapsed I was terrified to tell anyone.  But I told my mom and she was really supportive- she understood (more than I expected) that drinking would always be a struggle for me and she wanted to be supportive of me.  I don't necessarily tell everyone every time I've relapsed but when I don't tell people I find I am trying to control how they react to me.  What I found when I let myself be open and honest with others was I allowed them to show up and love me in an unconditional way.  I don't like telling people and I don't like knowing there may be consequences.  But overall I'm glad that I'm not keeping secrets it is not conducive to my sobriety. ..I'm sorry that you are suffering right now I know that my relapses have been incredibly emotionally painful.  I have also been very fortunate to have mostly supportive people around me.  I am not trying to tell you what to do I just want you to hear the story of someone who found they had more to gain by being honest than to lose by keeping secrets.  
Keeping secrets will likely aid in further relapsing. Just sharing my experience. 
Telling the truth always increase accountability to that people. it's the right choice to not fall again. they love you so they will understand you and surely will appreciate your opening
