Since my last post I've relapsed. I did really well only drinking beer ....however one night after 3 months beer led to liquor which led to another blackout where I may have done irreversible damage to my relationship. I now know that the being okay 98% of the time will never make up for the other 2% where I am a whole different person who does terrifying things I'd never want or dream of doing. It's not an excuse but I'm hoping others on here can relate to the kind of blackout I'm referring to...I've never gone to AA during my attempts at stopping before. I convinced myself I'm not an alcoholic since I can go months upon months with not drinking. However I realize how wrong I am. Tomorrow I'm going to my 1st AA meeting I'm finally ready to admit it.

I can definitely relate and it helps to reaffirm that a 98% chance of me being okay when I drink just isn't worth the other 2% of the time that damages every aspect of my life and tears down all my hard work. Our type of problem drinker (alcoholic or whatever you want to call it I just know I shouldn't drink) is tricky because we can lull ourselves into a false sense of security that we're okay to drink again. I have to be constantly vigilant but it's honestly been worth it so far. I'm productive on the weekends and wake up safe and healthy. Totally not worth whatever "good times" I have by drinking - what was once fun in college isn't fun anymore and I have to accept that and give it up! Good luck.
