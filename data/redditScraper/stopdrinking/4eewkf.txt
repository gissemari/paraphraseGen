So I've started attending AA regularly again and found myself a new sponsor I've had 5 in the past but I'm certain this one will be a good match he was at the first meeting I went to 2 years ago and has always been super supportive of me as I've relapsed and been in and out. I'm stoked to re-start my steps. I don't think that AA is everyone or that's the only way but I've seen how people grow in the rooms and I think the 12 steps are a great tool for getting the most out of sobriety. This site has been a great support for me and I'm more serious about my sobriety than ever I've stopped toying with the idea that I can start drinking again. I still get cravings but I will not give in not matter what. I've started to think about what I want from my future and generally feeling pretty good. My biggest issue right now is insomnia which is wearing me down. I will not drink tonight! .Have a good 24 hours everyone!
