Here I am rounding out Day 5. It's been interesting because starting with Day 3 I'd start getting that voice in my head near the start of the evening. "Go ahead man. Just have one beer. It's nothing." Thankfully I fought it but it wasn't easy...I tried going to 4 AA meetings this week (starting this past Sunday Day 1). The Sunday one was pretty good. We read Twelve Steps/Twelve Traditions and I got my 24 hour chip. The Monday morning one was good as well though it was a big group and I sat in the back listening to them read the Big Book and sharing their stories. I tried to go to another one that afternoon but although the city listed it as an AA meeting it was actually an NA meeting and that made me feel extremely uncomfortable. Then yesterday I went to one that was billed as a Young People's group. Being only 26 I was so excited for this.... but no. This was also an NA group...I don't know why I didn't stay with the NA groups both times. I mean we're both riding the same boat right? We both have a major demon to fight. What's the issue?..Those two times the temptation to get the beer was especially hard. I didn't do it though. I couldn't let myself down the way I have before. I also couldn't do that to my poor parents...Now I'm stuck. I'm happy to be on day 5. However I'm feeling so empty. This has never happened before. Prior relapses by the time day 5 rolled around I was feeling better and looking forward to being out in public and being outgoing -- even if it didn't involve drinking. Granted I started rolling down that hill again at least I had reached the top. Even though I'm climbing at this moment the climb is much more arduous. Prior relapse comebacks were the beautiful hikes we get here in Phoenix. Now this comeback I feel like I've decided to take on the Alps and I hate it...I don't feel satisfied with my job anymore. I don't feel comfortable living at home anymore. It's hard for me to spend time with my significant other. There's so much to look forward to in the coming months (e.g. a trip to the West Coast to see my favorite artist a trip to the Bay Area this summer) but nothing sounds appealing. If anything it sounds appealing so I can run away...This last relapse took so much from me. I don't know how to get me back anymore. I'm so thankful for this community being here to listen and to give me great words. This and the IRC chat really keep me going...Thank you for reading.
