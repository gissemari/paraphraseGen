So I had a dream where someone offered me a drink and I accepted. At first it was like I didn't even realize what I was accepting and then they showed me a bottle. I knew I should have said "Oh no thanks" but I felt embarrassed and instead just said that I would have a tiny bit. All the while it was like I knew I was dreaming and I was screaming at myself internally. It felt so awful. When I woke up I still had that awful feeling until I realized it was just a dream and I had in fact not relapsed. What a relief! Relapse dreams are the worst! On a related note I really want to learn how to lucid dream. I feel like that could be really useful in the event of future alcohol-related dreams.

Freaky shit eh? Dream-me sometimes says "no thank you I don't drink!" -- once I even thought of having to reset my SD badge *in the dream*; other times I gulp away and wake up feeling like I actually relapsed. The human brain is a fascinating fascinating thing.
