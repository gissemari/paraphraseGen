I relapsed in september 2018 and was struggling to not drink. Things got worse and worse to the point that i had bad dts and stopped going to work...I went in to work after missing a week and a half and my boss was ready to fire me. I told my boss i understand and have been struggling with addiction. Turns out the union im in covers rehab and instead of fireing me i was sent to a 30 day program...I got out on the 7th of april and have been going to aa meetings for support and am working the steps with a sponser...I still have hard days but it feels so much better being sober and after my relapse i know that i will never be able to drink like a normal person.

Glad that you are doing better. Congrats on being sober! I know I can never drink again too and I am ok with that. IWNDWYT
I know that if I drink I could die thats where it takes me...But I dont think about stopping drinking forever I just think I will not drink today and will try and not drink the next day.  ..Well done you cogratz.  ..Iwndwyt.
