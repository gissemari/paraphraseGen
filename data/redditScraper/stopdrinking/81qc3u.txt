It's been exceptionally easy for some reason but I've had enough slips to know better at this point. I've had a few rough moments but I got through them. I got myself an awesome sponsor attend meetings a few times a week and I talk about it with people. Sometimes putting it out there alleviates the cravings. For anyone struggling never take that first drink. It's never worth it. I will not be drinking with you today. xo

Yay! Great progress! Have a wonderful sober Saturday! IWNDWYT.
Me too. 3 weeks in and I feel so much better than I have every other time I have tried in the past. I'm thinking about things differently this time than I have in the past and that seems to be so much better for me than any other time I have tried before.
Great advice about the first drink or only one drink- it never is and always leads to bad things...I will not drink today and congrats on 3 weeks.
