[It's. that. day. again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi9eTOqqTMs)..You guessed it. Happy hump day! What's up Wednesdays are when we calibrate our sobriety check in see how our /sd buds are doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations with us below!..**Triumph:** First sober vacation was a roaring success!! All of my pent up anxiety was for naught I had a fantastic time and there was zero temptation to drink even being completely alone. I think a big part of that success was having an awesome sober friend to chat with when I needed to talk and it made a difference. I had an amazing time. And I'll remember every damn second. ..**Struggle:** Slept better than I have in a long time. Not much bad this week!..**General:**  So I had a great conversation with a friend and had to ask the SD community the same question! If you could see any artist/musician/performer dead or alive who would it be and why??  ..Mine would be Stevie Ray Vaughan. He is my favorite guitarist of all time and his shows that he put on after getting sober were just incredible.  ..[Tightrope from Austin City Limits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GX5ioDq1m5I)

Sounds like an awesome holiday... I'm green with envy!..I'm going to choose Dave Grohl. He seems like a really nice normal down to earth person... who happens to be an hugely talented muso. 
Greetings. Happy hump day fellow sobernauts..Triumph; I'm celebrating four months sobriety today. I had five years sobriety until late 2014 followed by 14 months of off on sobriety. Anyhow Ive got a very solid and disciplined routine in place. It all started to come together on 6th June this year when I came across SD..Struggle; With the fact that there are not enough hours in the day to catch up with the things I missed out on whilst I was drinking..General; I'm a very grateful happy bunny. Delighted to have found this sub. If you're new in please don't give up trying to stop and stay stopped. It may take time and there may be moments when it feels like it's too difficult. That's my experience. However the payoff is huge. Learning to stay stopped under any circumstances or relearning as is my case is he biggest gift I've ever given myself. Thanks to all SDers for helping me on my journey:-)
Hi I'm on day 3 and although it's so difficult I'm determined to keep going. Reading everyone else's experiences really helps I only hope these cravings pass or at least get easier to cope with. However waking up without a hangover is a wonderful thing. Would love to see Aerosmith! .
Triumph: I bought a refurbished spin bike for home so I can get some cardio and listen to my own playlist :)...Struggle: Still looking for a house. Every house I see online or in person I tend to mentally and emotionally move myself in so when it doesn't work out I get a bit sad. The housing market is tight around here at least in my price range...General: Wow...so tough. I'd wanna travel back in time to the 60s to see Jimi Hendrix the 70s to see Led Zeppelin the 80s/90s to see the Beastie Boys. All of those artists on my daily playlist. Challenge would be seeing them all sober but I'd love to accept that challenge!
Triumph: Hit my 30 days sober! And I think I may have found a lovely flat for me and my bf to move into. Fingers crossed we get it. That flat will never know drunk me. ..Struggle: The cravings hit HARD the last week but I got over them. I am also trying to set up my own business which is exciting and terrifying.  ..General: Ooooh probably peak Queen with Freddy Mercury I mean c'mon that show would be unbelievable.  
Triumph - I'm on day 4! I haven't went 4 days without a drink in years so this is big for me. ..Struggle - My face is breaking out. Wth? I also haven't had this happen in years. Darn it!..
Long day head with my co workers  I hope they don't stop for a drink on the way home because I am riding with them. I will not drink today no matter what.
**Triumph** Triple digits today! It's almost surreal seeing that number next to my name. My life has improved in so many ways it's been a real struggle at times but so worth it. My most heartfelt thanks goes out to everybody in this community I don't think I would have made it this far without you guys...**Struggle** Not much bringing me down this week. My biggest struggle was choosing which almond milk ice cream to buy for tonight's celebration :) ..**General** I missed out on seeing David Bowie before he passed. I had the opportunity to see him with Nine Inch Nails in Toronto but couldn't come up with the cash at the time. Wish I could go back in time and give myself a loan ha ha.
**Triumph:** 3 months!..**Struggle:** Still struggling with hormonal problems and it's really affecting my quality of life...**General:** I think Lydia Ainsworth. Her music resonates with me so much! *Right From Real* is one of the albums I consider as pretty much perfect from start to finish.

**Triumph:** planned a nice weekend trip to Eureka Springs (in the Ozarks) that was equal parts exciting and relaxing...**Struggle:** Eating disorder behavior. Not gonna lie. I'd be binging and purging a lot more if my husband wasn't around...**General:** It'd be cool to see something from a classical composer while they were still alive.
Triumph: 1 week of sobriety! This is the longest I've been sober since I started drinking. I feel so hopeful for what the future holds in store for me &amp; my loved ones. I'm so grateful for all the love &amp; support I have in this life. I'm feeling slightly sharper in thought &amp; vision. Actually read a book to fall asleep last 2 nights. ..Struggle: My body hurts. I'm f-in sore as hell! Feeling like I need to stretch &amp; exercise but for now I just wanna take things one day at a time &amp; not take on too much. I'm going back to work after a week off so I hope the stress doesn't lead to too much temptation. So far I've not had the urge to drink staying true to my promise. Staying busy yet pausing to check-in with myself. I feel the fog lifting. ..General: I told my sister I've quit drinking. This is huge for me. This means: I've made my decision hold me accountable. She even brought champagne for dinner &amp; I didn't even have an urge. So far so good. ..If I could see any show past or present it would be Talking Heads (full band just like Stop Making Sense). I could go see any show right now &amp; not even have to break away to go wait in line for beer! 
**Triumph:** PB'd my jumprope record and just got back down to fighting weight for jujitsu nationals in 2 weeks feel like I'm always hungry though :P..**Struggle:** Still trying to find a job 3 months after being laid off. The stress is enormous and is triggering symptoms of my heart disease it's scary and painful and scary some more but I'm sure for now I'm safe it just feels bad I got my meds and I'm taking care and I stay in good shape. Cause I'm not done yet. The economy in my country is terrible at the moment but I will find a job and get back to the cardiologist. I believe in myself...**General:** Yeah I'm going to have to say Stevie Ray Vaughn too he would have been 62 years old this week and he's a big role model for getting sober.  Just learned how to play the intro to "Empty Arms" on guitar. My bass player has picked up the tricky Texas shuffle for "Pride and Joy" amped to jam that together on Friday. I'm doing better than most I'm supported by my family. I have so much to be grateful for. I love life. I don't need to hide behind a bottle or a bag of powder that's not who I am anymore. I am a different creature now than what I used to be. 
Beginning day two of choosing not to drink. ..Triumph: As much as I didn't want to get out of bed this morning here I am on the train. Baby steps...Struggle: Coping with stress and loneliness without a bottle waiting for me at home It's an ongoing thing throughout the day and I wont kid myself that it's going anywhere any time soon...General: I went to AA for the first time. I quite enjoyed it. I'll find a meeting and go again tonight...Happy Humpday!
**Triumph:** Just over half way through my conference. NO CRAVINGS!!!  Not something I could ever imagine. Part of it is being surrounded by alcohol every day. Part is the daily became of how dumb boring and gross drunk or hung over people are. Part is my self care including maintaining my motivation...**Struggle:** A Swiss colleague said there is a term "woman who smooths the bumps".  I'm the guy smoothing the bumps as much as I can for the conference. The compliments are a welcome...**Concerts:** Just one? Ohh SRV Doors Hendrix Buffalo Springfield Buddy Holly Clash...  Yeah not good at choosing.
Triumph- Coming to the realization that I was drinking to much and finally doing something about it. (day 3)..Struggle- I'm an runner who's injured and it's taking it's own sweet time getting better. Running is a big stress reliever for me not having it is making the not drinking much harder...General- it would have to be Adele. 
triumph: first sober hump day in a few weeks. first sober four days in a row in 18 months...struggle: feeling anxious...general: stevie ray vaughan is a great answer. stevie ray is also one of my favs. haven't listened to him in a while and i think i may go dig out some old mp3 files. i would love to attend the grand ole opry with marty stuart as host and performer. my old man used to listen to that show on the radio when i was a kid.
Mornin! ..My triumph this week was my first sober show! It was on a Monday and I made it to work Tuesday! The last time I saw this band I blacked out...Struggle: my SO has a friend in town that makes me want to poke my eyes out...my old self really wants to soften the brutality of their personality with booze. ..I'm not drinking today no matter how loud they smack their food! ;-) ..Edit to add general: I've been listening to the new Solange album it's powerful. 
**Triumph:**  I am solid on my paleo challenge despite being ridiculously busy.  I cannot believe how much fat I can eat and not gain weight!  Front yard is slowly coming together (planting is happening today dammit!)..**Struggle:**  Girlfriend is still struggling to find a decent job and that is stress on multiple fronts.  I'm trying not to go into codependent mode and just surrender to whatever happens.  I cannot do this work for her...**General:**  Mmm SRV would be wonderful.  I also would've liked to have seen Johnny Cash The original Almond Brothers and AC/DC with Bon Scott.  Current wish list is Tom Petty Mumford &amp; Sons Nathaniel Rateliff.
Triumph: A full week of sobriety and I gave my sister the bottle of vodka my aunt bought me for my birthday. ..Struggle: Terminally ill boyfriend continues to fade and it's heartbreaking. Fingers crossed we hear from the transplant team soon. But he's opening up to the idea of a living donor so we'll see about that maybe...General: I am covered in bruises with absolutely no idea how I got them. Very strange. Anyway I would love to see Amy Winehouse I saw her once at The Brits in 2007 (or maybe it was 06) and she was completely smashed but still incredible. I'd love to see her perform properly.
Triumph: made it through a wedding - my first sober one. Maybe being invited to weddings will happen more often for me now!.Struggle: Things are still rocky with my girlfriend and I'm not making enough money..General: This board is awesome and I get a lot of support from it and so do a lot of other people. What do y'all think about having more in-depth discussion of literature and ideas here?
welcome back straty! I hope you had an awesome ACL adventure. ..**Triumph:** nine months!!!..**Struggle:** I hate getting screened for cancers all the damn time. it makes me feel like a lab rat. ..**General:** just one?? SRV for sure - my favorite solo musician of all time. Jimi Hendrix Janis Joplin and The Who at the Monterey Pop Festival 1967 - they all had incredible stage energy and this was such an iconic event for music and counterculture in the US. Lionel Hampton at the Blue Note 1940s - his vibraphones soothe my soul I can only imagine what it sounded like in a special venue. I would have also said Yo-Yo Ma but I crossed that off my bucket list last month - he was amazing!
Triumph: started counseling for depression and anxiety and found a support group to meet with...Struggle: after almost hitting a week sober I drank on several of the last few days. Back to day 1. ..General: honestly can't think of an answer for this
Happy hump day! It's been a tough few days but I feel clear headed this morning enjoying my cup of coffee and tuning up the drums later today. I'm excited to take on another 24 hours  not drinking today :)
Happiest of days to you all. ..Triumph: Today I woke up with no hangover and in reasonable good physical health. I have great support. ..Struggle: I can't seem to pull the anchor out of my ass and do anything. I need to find a job clean my house finish my thesis and get on with life. But here I sit. I'm a bit overwhelmed. ..Edit: Artist: Dave Brubeck---always regretted never seeing him. 
Triumph :  been 3 months now since my last drink still think about it from time to time but it's gotten easier. ..Struggle:  It turns out all my friends are tired of sisters drunken nonsense as well I don't know if I should say anything or not.  So far avoidance has been working. ..General:  The group Kottonmouth Kings used to have a dancer guy named Pakelika.  I was a huge fan of him he was an amazing dancer brilliant lyricist and all around nice guy he passed away a few years ago due to a heart attack caused by an asthma attack at the age of 42.  I would love to see him perform one last time.  Stay Giant. 
Hello people. .Triumph : I have 7 full days! While this may not seem like a lot it is to me because this is the second longest period ive managed since the age of 18. (33 years old now). My previous PB was 10 days in 2013 when I was on medication for an unrelated issue. Then I shouldn't even have been drinking at all but I held out for a full 10 days before cracking. I'm looking forward to beating that comfortably this time around. .Struggle : none to speak of so far. What i did do last Friday night though very deliberately  was to myself to the shopping market and purposely browse the liqor section. Not with any intention to buy but to reinforce my sobriety face the deamons that type of thing. I found it empowering. Kind of a "this is what I'm leaving behind"  deal. It felt good! .General: sleeping better than I have in ages and dark circles have gone from under the eyes. Managed to run 3 times this week and planning on running tomorrow too. My next. challenge will be this Friday and Saturday night. But one day at a time for the moment. ..I wish you all strength. 
Triumph: Today is 30 days. Not since I was in my mid-20s (I think) could I say that. Made it through my drinking buddy's wedding on Sunday with nary a drop and had fun...Struggle: I've had fleeting thoughts on moderating. ..General: David Lee Roth. He is the epitome of reinvention!
**Triumph:** After going to a couple of social events over the last weekend I've finally realised that I do not need alcohol to socialise at all. Had a great time zero temptation!..**Struggle:** Too many plans not enough time!..**General:** I can't say of got any one great performer I'd want to see over others there's too many in all sorts of different styles.
Triumph: I've finally started exercising specifically biking. I've managed 3.5 miles over two days. I've actually enjoyed it which is a change in of itself. So far the urge to drink has lightened it's stronghold on me...Struggle: I'm averaging about 4 hours of sleep regardless of time I go to bed. Started using Sleep as Android to track my sleep cycle apparently I toss and turn a LOT...General:  not eating much right now real loss of appetite. What have you all done in this circumstance?
T:  I quit my job.  And less than 48hrs later  the company got sold.  Coincidence?   You tell me...S:  I'm just really stressed out and my sleep schedule is all off...G:  Daft Punk.  Alive 2017?
Checking in one week today!!! I will not drink today 
Triumph: It feels great to be back at day 1..Struggle: I'm confidant that this is the right decision however I'm trying to not make this sound like a big deal with all my friends. I think I just have to comminuted to them that for me the biggest thing is having it out in the open..Live show: I'd love to see Nicole Moudaber play another 10 hour set
Never gonna drink
