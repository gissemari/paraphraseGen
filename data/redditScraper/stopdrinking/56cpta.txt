Hang in there!
Hiya. I'm rooting for you. You can do this:-)
Be tough! Those feelings don't last...Anything you can think of to distract yourself?
Hey :) hang in there. Just a craving. It'll go away.
Don't drink!
Hang in there. Distract yourself. Go for a walk drink some water listen to some music. I found that altering my routine made it much easier to fight cravings and deal with withdrawals.
Hope you are doing okay!  If you stay restless and fidgety why not try going for a walk or something.  Throw on some tunes and get some exercise.  Might help to get some of that nervous energy out and release some good endorphins. 
There's a link to the IRC here in the sidebar on the right. Our chat room has saved me a million times and I love all the support (and fun actually!) that I have in there :).
Be the storm.
