I joined AA  after much resistance to the past. Crosby on here has always stuck in my mind with saying you have to change something every relapse to get sober. So after over a year dry I drank. Decided to get my ass in AA and actually work the program. My HP must have heard me cause I found the perfect meeting for me. I can walk there. The people are amazing. I made a home group and it's so nice to have that accountability in real life. Thanks all for being here. I read your posts on the daily. You inspire me daily. IWNDWYT

That's awesome mermaid proud of you making the change.  It's not easy but good things happen :)
Woo hoo!  CoolCrosby has inspired many including me!
This is great to hear! When I showed up at AA I was really desperate to stop so I figured I had nothing to lose by actually giving the program an honest try. I'm so glad that I did! 
Good for you. It really helped me my first year to have a regular meeting to go to at least once a week. IWNDWYT 
That's great man! I love my home group their really great people. I'm glad you found a place where you are comfortable. :) 
Awesome. It feels so  good to have a home in sobriety.  
Keep comin'
