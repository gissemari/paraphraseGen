Hi Gang- Safe travels to everyone on the move for Thanksgiving. .We are picking up my daughter and her boyfriend this evening and driving to Missouri for my husband's family's Thanksgiving. For 30 years we've alternated Thanksgivings and Christmases between our families. I always like the years where we are in Missouri for T-day and with my family in Nebraska for Christmas :-) ..I used to think holidays were best celebrated with bottles of wine and whiskey drinks. Ugh. I remember puking into a plastic shopping bag we just happened to have in the car (thank god) after one Christmas eve not all that many years ago. Just one of a thousand "last times." ..I'm so grateful for this Reddit group. I've been working on sobriety since the late 1990s and was alcohol-free from 2000 to 2005 with several months-long stretches since then. It's been a long slog with way too many relapses but I'm finally at home with my decision and determination to stay sober. For me peer support and a conscious daily commitment has made the difference...I'll be offline until the weekend. Wishing you all the joy that comes from being the true you - without chemical additives.
