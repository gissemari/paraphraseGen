**Backstory** I love to dream. Throughout my life I have tried to master techniques for lucid dreaming. I did well when I was teenager and had begun to dabble in the tricky feat of flying. It was a challenge for me; the farthest I had ever gotten was long-range hopping and floating. I would get that roller-coaster feeling in my stomach when I tried if I was able to bring myself to jump in the first place. As I got older my dreams became fuzzy. I lost control of them. I was a pawn at the will of my subconscious. Eventually I stopped dreaming altogether. In the last seven years I would remember a dream every three months or so. Since I quit drinking alcohol for a month I have a had a dream every night. They have not all been memorable; but the ones that stand out have told the story of my recovery thus far. I am working the steps of AA and I recently (mostly) completed Step Four. I keep remembering a famous quote used in the section of the big book that I read last night: *The truth will set you free.* Ladies and gentlemen of SD I flew last night! I would like to share with you my progression. ..At first it was a struggle a war that raged among my own inner-thoughts. Day three was one of the worst battles the beginning to the end of my illness...During the day I decided to go camping with my parents and five year-old niece. To experience the serene *wilderness* of a state-of-the-art campground on the Missouri far from the ever-glowing downtown lights would be good for me. Right? Long story short my parents both have record-breaking low stress-thresholds. Merely getting our truck and little vintage camper on the road - all hands feet sodas chairs coolers toys ect. inside the vehicle - was a nightmare in itself motivated on yelling and cussing. By the time we got going I was a quiet neurotic mess. I had the big book in my lap and my 24-hour token on a chain around my neck. I cried a little and silently asked for strength. I "prayed"; to whom well who really knows? If not before now I was surely at step one. ..**Dream** That night many of my worst anxieties and fears came true. I am outside. Standing on a foreign intersection somewhere with my family. My mother is yelling. A car comes out of nowhere in the distance. I don't recognize it. My niece is riding her bicycle down the street much farther away than we typically allow her to wander. Something doesn't feel right. The car stops grabbing my niece and pulling her inside. My brain is scrambled. I feel drunk. I can't react. Who was that? I'm trying to understand. Do they know her? The air is choppy and I can't see straight. My parents disappear; I'm alone. Now I'm the one screaming. I become a maniac. I can see myself from an out-of-body view. I drop to the ground with my hands over my ears and my eyes closed. Trying to make it all stop. I watch my ex drive by slowly watching my mental breakdown through his purple-tinted aviators. Pursed lips shaking his head. I felt shame...I rarely have nightmares. On the occasions when I do dream about awful things I awake relieved turn around and fall back asleep. This night I awoke covered in sweat and sick to the stomach. I still felt overwhelming fear and anxiety. I stumbled out of the camper to the restrooms where I tried to puke. I cried still feeling as though my world might be melting. Thankfully my loving SO answered his phone after I managed to compose myself and call him. He reminded me that the subconscious is a powerful thing. .."It was probably your mind showing you the worst part of your thinking when you were drinking" he says...*I hope I was never that insane* I think. I probably was..."They are normal" he says "drunk dreams."..The next week was a consistent cycle of relapse through my dreams. ..**Dream** Night Four it is a "tall boy" PBR Pabst Blue Ribbon outside of one of my favorite bars. I don't recall drinking it; though quickly it is empty in my hand. I become irate. How could I let this happen? I throw the can to the ground. I'm angry at myself and my lack of control...**Dream** Night Five I'm sitting at a large table with many friends. Most of them I do not recognize or care to carry a conversation with not unlike my experience drinking while awake. One of them buys me a drink. It is a red liquid in a small cocktail glass. Everyone is drinking them. *Maybe a cranberry vodka?* I don't really care. I don't feel guilt until there is only one sip left. I look down at my nearly-empty glass of depression and mistakes. All at once I remember that I have quit. I begin to fidget with items on the table for no reason. I grab the glass thinking *what do I do with the rest? What do I do with what I have already drank? Should I purge it? Do I make myself vomit? What if I just not tell anyone?*..Throughout the nights I return to Day Zero again and again. I begin to care less. The dream-world eerily resembles that of when I drank heavily. The fuzziness the spins. I begin to expect the dreams and wake up less alarmed...Edit: I've decided to make this part one of two since it is much longer than I realized it would be and I have things to do today. Until then remember: as an active alcoholic I daydreamed about lucid dreaming undeterred by the fact that I could not remember nor control the memories I created while I was awake. ..For those who are curious:..Night Sixteen: My recently deceased friend visiting me or a figment of my imagination?..Night Twenty- Five: Cemetery   cleaning house taking inventory the angel with her hands and feet tied still sick..Night Twenty-Eight: Drunk Dream   feelings of despair thoughts of giving up ..Night Twenty-Nine: Hit by a semi-truck - there has got to be some imagery there..Night Thirty-Two: Flying
