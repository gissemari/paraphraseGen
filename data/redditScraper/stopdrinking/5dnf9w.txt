Hi guys it's Friday and I've got an extremely busy day ahead of me. Last time I relapsed was a Friday just like this. Wish me luck thanks!

Good luck to us both C. I'll check back in with you later and let's congratulate each other on an awesome sober Friday!
Good luck! You got this :)
this is a great accountability post! ..during my busy days it helps me to check into SD regularly even if I just read a post or two. it keeps my head on track and reminds me that there are much healthier ways to handle stress. ..best wishes we're here for you!..*edit: I also like to plan a "celebration" for getting through the day something I can look forward to during the horribly busy moments. for me tonight that's a haircut. I know that sounds weird but it's a nice salon that uses fancy-ass product and gives me a full head &amp; shoulders massage. hell yes. is there something you can look forward to tonight?
How did your day go?
Day went well thanks for asking! Got home quick after work fought off some mild cravings and now I'm just relaxing for the night.
