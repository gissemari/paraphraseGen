Wishing all my sober peeps a Happy St. Patricks Day from Dublin. Remember it's just a day and we'll get through it hour by hour. You don't need to drink today just because of a Welsh saints feast day...It's my second sober Paddy's Day (relapsed at the end of last year). It is a really difficult day for sure but I'm thinking of how lovely it will be to wake up hangover free tomorrow and to fully enjoy the long weekend. I'm just going to head out for a run now something I would never have done in Paddy's Days gone by. Later I'll get the fire on later and hopefully watch Ireland beat England in the rugby. ..I hope everyone enjoys their day sober. It's just one day and we'll get through it a day at a time. Xx
