What do normal people do when they are walk-in around and need to kill time without stopping in for a drink? 
----------immediate responses--------

Get a coffee instead. Or I just keep walking for exercise.   
Get any other kind of drink or a sweet treat and keep walking :)
Read A book. Listen to music. get a cup of tea or coffee. Take a walk in the fresh air . Go to the library I could go on and on. Or look at some of the posts on SD and respond to them-best ones would be the ones that interest you or that you connect with. Stay strong you got this-alcohol has nothing to GIVE you it will only take. :) I will not drink with you today. 
I usually call a sober friend.

I like to walk around. There's so much cool stuff to see when I actually pay attention! Consciousness is a beautiful thing!!
