Some thoughts on hitting a milestone. Apologies in advance for rambling...Four months. That's something. It really is...The last time I went four months with no alcohol was before I started drinking so over ten years ago...I've been craving a drink this past week. Not sure why. I keep waiting for the cravings to go away. I guess they don't ever go away entirely but at least they pop up less frequently. And if nothing else I don't have to remind myself not to swing by the liquor store on the way home every day...I've broken the habit part...I've tried to quit before but this time it's sticking. I think the reason is that I have used this as an opportunity to generally get my shit together so I am doing better overall. I'm not stopping with getting sober...I'm finally getting my finances in order. They could be a lot better than they are and it's going to take a few years to get them where I want them to be but that's just fine. Because I know that I *can* get them there. It's sure nice not spending hundreds of dollars a month on poison. ..(It's also nice not spending thousands of dollars a year or tens of thousands of dollars a decade on poison. It's hard to say why but it's easier for me to think long term than it used to be.)..And I'm finally in shape! I've been running and doing bodyweight fitness. I can do a few pull-ups for the very first time in my life!..None of this is to say my life is perfect. But I'm now working on the parts of my life that need fixing rather than turning away from them and into a bottle...I rarely post here but this sub has been and continues to be a huge help for me. I am a musician so I am literally the only person I know who doesn't drink (and most of my friends and acquaintances drink the way I used to - in excess and every day) so it's nice to have a community like this...Thank you each and every one of you...If you are struggling please stick with it. It is worth it. You will get free money better health a clearer mind and more self-confidence and all you have to do is not put poison in your body. If you stumble get back up. Feel free to PM me if you ever feel like that could be helpful...Finally here are some other subreddits that have been helpful to me in my general *Get Your Shit Together treesandclouds* project:../r/bodyweightfitness ../r/personalfinance ../r/ynab ../r/Meditation ..TLDR: Four months feels great looking forward to more! Stick with it to anyone who is just starting out. I absolutely promise you it will be worth it.

&gt;&gt;None of this is to say my life is perfect. But I'm now working on the parts of my life that need fixing rather than turning away from them and into a bottle...I totally know how this feels.  Problems are way more solvable... now that I actually try to solve them.  Not drinking is a good feeling.  Good for you for 4 months!
Nice one!
