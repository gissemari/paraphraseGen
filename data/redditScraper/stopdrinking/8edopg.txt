After those first several weeks I've pretty much been rocking along. Sure I hit some bad places from time to time but the thought about having a drink never sticks around very long. ..Last week had some bumps in the road of life and was feeling pretty down. And the ol' A.V. starts whispering "now's the time you know a drink would help you relax and feel better it's not backsliding it's just a one-time thing to get through this . . . "..And then after a little while a brand new thought entered my head totally unexpected. "That would taste bad" I thought. "Wine would taste like vinegar to me now. And whiskey would burn." I thought some more. "And I'd probably throw up after one drink." And then my other defenses to drinking started coming on-line and kicking in and the moment passed. ..But I thought "Wow things really have changed so much. I really wouldn't enjoy having a drink now." And I felt good about that. So I wanted to share it with you! Sure there's always temptation. But you just keep getting stronger even if you don't realize it.

I quit cigarettes end of 2016 and I have the same defense. If I smoked a cig right now it would be absolutely awful and disgusting. 
First thoughts are funny little creatures. ..I love this one though because it's so *true*..I walked past a pub and the doors opened as I walked past (this is a few years back). I'd been there maybe once in a past life and all I remember is recoiling from the smell that hit me...Decades of booze soaked into the carpet and it smelt beyond rank. ..Its not the thought - it's what I do with it next that counts. ..
