So tonight i realise i made it my first week for ME im not staying sober for my now "ex" fiancee im doing it for me and i feel so much better for it. I havent skipped a workout this weekend and i slept for 12 hours straight i felt amazing this morning. Im spending the weekend working on a presentation i have to make in an interview for a dream job for me. I can literally see my life changing for the better in such a small amount of time im in the best shape of my life have a great opportunity at a great job and have signed up for counselling to work on some issues i have so that i can continue on this upward momentum. Im happy for me and because i deserve it and anyone who denies themselves true happiness by drinking instead of living and being conscious of whats in the way is missing out. Good luck to anyone struggling tonight i hope we all make it together. The only way is UP!
