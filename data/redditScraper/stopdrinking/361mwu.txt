The two week mark is upon me. I am filled with pride anxiety and a desire to go spend the rest of my money on booze. I know I can't I also know I won't. However the craving no matter how quickly they pass almost feels like an eternity. I'm grateful in the morning for not being hungover it's the evening time I struggle with the most.

can you try breaking up your routine? shake up your evening by going to a movie taking yourself out to dinner going for a hike whatever you enjoy. wear yourself out so you get home tired and then feel great waking up without a hangover!
Yep.  I'm lucky the cravings pass quickly for me.  And I too still feel like alcohol is appropriate for a celebration but not for me obviously. Many here have noted that to deal with cravings they DO something meditate run work out pray and so on. Way to go on your two weeks! Keep up the good work.
I was once having this craving and in the middle I had a weird question pop into my head - do I have a copy of my motorcycle insurance card in my house? I didn't need it I had a copy in the bike and I can print out as many copies as I want but I decided to answer it. I spent fifteen minutes looking through my drawers and decided I didn't. Then I remembered I was having a craving which was now gone. ..I don't think you need to overengineer your distractions from cravings. It is really anything that steals focus for a minute and sometimes you need to force yourself to just start it. ..
