Well yesterday is day one. I'd been planning toward this for some time lurking here. I created a new account since I'm not ready to share this particular personal detail with coworkers who know me on reddit. ..I've been a daily drinker for years and need a reset with my relationship with alcohol. I don't know how easy or hard this is going to be for me but I have struggled to stop in the past. ..Off to download the naked mind and make it through today. ..I'll tackle tomorrow tomorrow.
