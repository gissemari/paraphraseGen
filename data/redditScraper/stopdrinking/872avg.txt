Ive had to reset twice since I started here in January ( much to my disappointment in myself ) however  I feel like this time that I am stronger.I know I can have more than one month sober.I know I really don't want to get drunk again..I know its hard work .I know it is life changing .And I now Know I'm ready for that change .

I had a similar experience. I am three weeks sober tomorrow.  Even in the last few days of drinking I felt that the end was coming which is weird when drinking a half bottle of vodka every second day.   I have been listening to loads of podcasts lately and there does appear to be a turning point.  Let's hope this is yours!
  good to hear
