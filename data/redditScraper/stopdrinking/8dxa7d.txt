I have 109 days sober but I have been struggling lately. I want to post just because maybe somebody else is struggling as well (all of us New Years sobernauts) - just know you're not alone. For the last two weeks I've been bordering on a relapse. Work has become more stressful than before and the alcohol demon has immediately started to whisper "hey maaaaan let's just get wasted.. we'll only drink one night and then back to being sober.. you've got a hundred days already it's easy.. if you only drink one night you don't even have to reset your badge.. nobody will know.. you deserve to relax and enjoy yourself!"..But I haven't caved! It's never one night - I know better! I will not succumb to you alcoholic brain so you can just stop it!.The main tool I use is playing the tape forward. I visualize the next morning being hungover and ashamed. It's never worth it! Another source of help is the Recovery Elevator podcast and of course I read a lot of SD (sometimes I even read at work). Thanks everybody this place is amazing!..We just need to hang in there...take it one day at a time. Even one hour at a time if need be... This too shall pass! I will not drink with you today! Thanks for reading and have a great weekend!

Well done for your insightful approach...Its never one night for me either i feel absolutely awful the next day that i drink to tolerate it and numb my brain from thinking and here the cycle starts again.... Can you increase your exercise during these stressful periods...? Meet up more with friends even attend an AA meeting may help...your doing great just open your tool box wider and try and use all of them to get you through... 
I know that first drink will send me back to my old ways sooner or later... I won't go there!  No way no thanks!  Let's not drink that first drink together.  Sober is worth it!
