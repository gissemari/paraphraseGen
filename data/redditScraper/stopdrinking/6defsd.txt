My husband checked into detox yesterday. I know I need to stop as well but am the only one working right now. I am trying to get to meetings as much as possible but while being the only one to watch the two kids and a job requiring a lot of driving during the day it is no easy task. Read This Naked Mind and have all the right intentions but still struggling. Any ideas?

I found that just not drinking today is the best way for me to stay on track.  Just for today I will not drink.  And for those times when it's really in my face I just put off that first sip as long as possible.  Before I crack that beer I'll do a chore or take the dog on a walk or fold laundry.  Procrastinating that first sip has saved me many times...
Well one thing I use when I can't get to meetings is speaker tapes. This is one of my favorites http://recoveryradionetwork.podcastpeople.com/posts/57749 but that site has tons. So maybe you can listen to them while driving...Also have you heard of HALT? It's a slogan - never let yourself get too Hungry Angry Lonely or Tired - these are all states that commonly precede a drink. ..One of the most helpful things I heard early in my recovery was that I had to put my sobriety before anything else in my life because everything I put in front of it - my job my relationship my apartment - I would lose. It just helped me prioritize my days which I had a lot of trouble with. (1) things that keep me sober (phone calls to sober friends AA meetings prayer/meditation) (2) everything else
Hey! Good on you for taking the first steps. This is a great supportive community and there are some really great sobriety resources in the sidebar. There's also a 24hr IRC chat room for the sub. Tons of live support at your fingertips. ..https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/stopdrinking/
