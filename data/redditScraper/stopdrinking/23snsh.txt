So I relapsed. It was the first real crack I had at not drinking and lasted just over 30 days...Basically I went on holiday and lasted about 5 days and told myself I could drink just this once and ended up drinking for 2 weeks straight almost. Not copious amounts like i used to but still at least 6-10 beers a day. ..It's interesting I start off so motivated and won't have any temptation to drink and then I slowly notice myself saying oh you can drink one day it's annoying how my mind plays tricks like that. I just need to remember that I can't drink like a normal person no matter how tempting it is to try. There's to much I want to do and achieve right now! ..Well I'm on day 3 now!..Thanks for listening this place is an awesome inspiration.

Welcome back. Learn from that experience and use it in the future!
Glad you're one of the lucky ones who made it back. Not everyone does. It helped me to make a detailed written list of all the ways alcohol negatively affected me. There's more to getting well than simply not drinking. Counseling and a support group was comforting and encouraged necessary personal growth.
