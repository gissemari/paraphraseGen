Every generation of one side of my family was and are alcoholics. As far back as I know anyways. It killed three of them in my lifetime who knows how long others will last. To add onto that both sides of my family are very supportive of 'functional alcoholics". As long as you take care of you family and job who cares? A successful career and life gives you the green light to drink up every evening regardless of what it does to you physically and mentally. Even as you struggle to hold that playing card castle of your life together...This is the longest I have been sober since becoming an adult. And it isn't even close. The further I get into this journey the more strength I take from the fact that I am the one who will break my family's mold. I wasted many years in the bottle and 40 isn't far away but I'm making up for it every day. I now get to look at my kids with the realization that they will never see me drink again. That they will have a dad that grew up in that bullshit alcohol centered culture and they will have a dad who is brutally honest about their family's history who he has lost and what that poison did to him for some of their early childhood. They will have what I wish I had. Truth and awareness...So if you're like me and have a chance to break a cycle that has persisted for generations take that step and do it. You are fundamentally changing future generations of your family and on those tough days that thought can lend you the strength you need to carry on.
