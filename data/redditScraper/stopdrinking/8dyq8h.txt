I recently started a new job in a new city. Blank Slate. The first week I was here I relapsed and binged. I missed a few days of work and said I had food-poisoning. In truth I was waking up and finding my next drink and drinking until I passed out...That was last week. On Friday an HR person emailed me to ask if I had any food allergies. I replied that I was severely allergic to alcohol. The office has Friday Happy Hours. My new coworkers asked me if I felt good enough ("Food-Poisoning") to get drunk. I told them I was deathly allergic to alcohol. I don't really why know I made up the white lie but it felt great. And it is actually true in a very real way. I have a horrible reaction to drinking and it is damaging to my health. ..I've been trying to be sober for about three years. Few good stretches many week long relapses. It is time I stick too it. I feel like this is the time. ..Also. Avicii died as a result of deteriorated health due to excessive drinking. That was a bit of a wake up call this Friday after a few days of HEAVY drinking until blackout and missing work.

I'm 22 months clean off meth I've never really been a big drinker but lately these last two months I've been drinking three or four nights a week and missing a lot of work and feeling like a pile of shit honestly being a meth addict is easier on the body and there isn't a hangover. Find myself developing a dependency and I too need to shut that off asap. ..Try smoking weed. 
pay absolute attention men this shite is the real reality
I'm a bartender currently and I told my job I had an allergy to alcohol. Don't feel bad if they ask you for more details you can specify it's the fermentation process :) 
I'm allergic to alcohol  I break out in handcuffs. ..Seriously though  I have no control over what alcohol does to me that's why I got sober.
