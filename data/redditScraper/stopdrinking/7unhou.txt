I have drank off and on but mostly on since my early 20s and am currently in my mid 40s. I have always struggled with the amount that I drink. I always needed to drink enough to get drunk if not completely smashed...I finally found a concrete reason to quit a few years ago. When I drink my hands and feet burn and my nervous system is damaged. I now need to take Gabapentin to avoid the pain especially before bed. Unfortunately I am stubborn and kept drinking but I have reached the end of my rope...I am writing this to commit myself. I can't keep damaging myself further and enough is enough.
