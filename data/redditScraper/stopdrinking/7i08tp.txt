Hi stop drinking.Started aa 2 months ago going most nights...Really helpful. I know it's go it's critics and that's fair enough but I've chosen it for the time being and it has really helped me. I can open up I've got a support group I've got some good ideas about trying to stop drinking...I didn't drink for 2 months then this weekend I had a lapse...I was driving back from seeing a non aa friend and I was  fuck it ..Who the fuck can tell me I can't have a drink? I don't want the fucking rules these restrictions on my tucking life! Fuck you all...you get the picture. Rant time to justify drink time...I even said and argued myself out of calling a aa contact because  they'll only try to fucking talk me out of it . I can laugh at this now...because.....I did it. I did the bottle of vodka. And....nothing. No joy no euphoria no fireworks no party no extra fun. Nothing. ..I went to sleep. Woke up in the morning with fuzzy thinking. And then crippling anxiety. Paranoia. Fear. Doom and gloom. The universe is wrong. One of the worst hangovers I've ever experienced...This is great news - here's why.1. I contacted an aa member Monday and went Monday Tuesday to a meeting...2. Alcohol was such a disappointment! Nothing like I remembered in my head. Anti-climax. So my first association with alcohol is now the angst I gave myself the next day...3. I shared this at a group meeting even though my ego was struggling to admit I'd fucked up. I definitely have had nice guy syndrome! My ego is massive! I can see that now!..4. An experienced aa member explained that - you can have a drink anytime you want mate don't come to aa if you desire. Nobody is forcing you to do anything. You've got options. That really helped diffuse the problem around fuck it mode!..So all in all a very positive drinking experience. Association changed ego identified resentment resolved through a perception shift and alcohol was a massive angst inducing anti climax...I feel at peace with the lapse and feel good about the outcomes..I feel more sure than ever that if that fuck it feeling boils up again I'll call somebody...It feels like a shift has happened. That anxiety for 2 days afterwards for nothing...I hope this helps somebody else out there with anger about feeling denied a drink. It's my ego saying it knows best it can cope. It can't...IWNDWYT........
