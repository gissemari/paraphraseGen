So last night I had my first dream that I had screwed up and drank a pint of whiskey or rum (the dream shifted in the middle).  I was so disappointed in myself and couldn't believe that I had slipped up.  I woke up and was pleasantly surprised to be neither drunk nor hungover; what a relief!  In the waking world I'm just shy of two weeks sober and feel better than I have in years.  One of my coworkers calls me Xanax guy because I'm so much more chill than I used to be although I'm not taking anything at all. (No judgment to anyone who is by the way.) Panic and anxiety are lower than they have been in recent memory and I'm liking the changes that are happening. So here's to keeping relapses in the realm of dreams and enjoying the sober life I had been missing all along.
