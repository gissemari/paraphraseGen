Boredom is often the cause of alcoholism and the reason for relapse. Besides the desire to be sober I think we need to restructure our lives and participate in meaningful activities that give us joy. ..Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqKdEhx-dD4&list=PLZRRxQcaEjA4qyEuYfAMCazlL0vQDkIj2) video especially the beginning. Personally I can relate to the experiment. Instead of the pain inducing shocking mechanism for stimulation I used alcohol when faced with boredom despite knowing I was engaging in self-destructive behavior...Thoughts?

Agreed.
Personally I'm trying to fix the shitty life the last 18 years of drinking gave me I'm too busy to be bored. :)
