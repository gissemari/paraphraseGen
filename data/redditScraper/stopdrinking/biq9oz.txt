Alright. So my last drink was on January 30 before that it was November 20. I drank very heavily and struggled for eight years and I'm really thankful to have made it this far into sobriety. No booze no pot no nothing other than caffeine and nicotine. ..I'm beginning to notice the post acute withdrawal syndrome episodes as they come; it's as if I can feel my brain chemicals pulling back and forth at times. Sometimes I'm up and my head is in the game other times I'm having a harder time and things seem cloudy. ..So at this point I'm trying to let go of nicotine. I smoked about a pack a day for eleven years I'm basically down to one or two or three smokes a day. I'm wondering if I should just go ahead and get this out of the way while my brain is leveling out or if I should just slow down and worry about nicotine later on...Other than that I'm proud to say tomorrow will be 90 days and the longest I've been sober in over eight years. :-)..IWNDWYT

That's awesome what a huge accomplishment! Congratulations...My thought is that you'll quit nicotine when you're ready to quit and it sounds like you're making your way there.
