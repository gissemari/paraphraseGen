Hi all :) I've suffered from all of the above except for tics. I read about magnesium in an anxiety forum. Magnesium controls muscle contractions among other things i.e. the heart. I've tried a few different brands in tablet form and they did nothing. ..Then I read about and ordered Natural Calm Magnesium from USA (I live in Scandinavia). This last week has been a huge turnaround for me    I had a stupidly high resting pulse for being me 95-105 bpm (coffee being a huge contributor). After starting that supplement it went down to 60 as is my normal rate. It has also massively impacted how I deal with strangers in group settings and other triggers for panic attacks :) I just feel bloody calm  ..I can't recommend it highly enough!

I just started taking NC myself. I love it!
I love that stuff!!!!
What is it.... just magnesium supplement?
I found magnesium helped me with leg and foot cramps which in turn improved my sleep. As for panic attacks I do not believe it helps me with that at all. What did help was to greatly lower my caffeine use. Getting free of alcohol seemed to make caffeine affect me much more and has triggered panic attacks. I keep it down to a bit of tea these days.
I totally agree. Magnesium is wonderful: I am a true believer. It helps me with my mental health physical health and digestion.
