I was doing so well but I relapsed under pressure the past few days. I was enjoying life and spending time with my children. Now I am facing divorce. She deserves better anyway.

I've been there man I've quit before and relapsed as well.  It's hard but you can do it again take it one day at a time.  I'm sorry to hear about the divorce.  I've let alcohol end relationships too and it drove me to drink more and it made everything worse than ever.  
That is too bad. Do you have a plan to stay sober now? 
I'm sorry to hear about your struggles. I've had relapses in the past and it's likely the majority of people here have too.  ..The key that I've found is that you can't get too down on yourself (as hard as that sounds) and to just get back on the wagon.  You'll also need to determine what went wrong and how to prevent it in the future. ..Best of luck to you. 
Let's first separate what happened from who you are. You are not a failure! Relapse is never pleasant but it happens. I relapsed numerous times. Each one was instructive. Let this one be instructive. It takes what it takes...I'm sure you know sobriety gives you your best chance at a good life including your marriage. My wife moved out for a year but came back. Focus on the sobriety over anything else. Spend one minute on the problem and the rest of the time on the solution. When I made sobriety number one everything that came second came first class. 
I failed does not equal being a "failure."  What is the answer to failing?  Trying again.  That's why we do this 24 hours at a time.  It's why [the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) begin with a conscious daily decision + recovery.  You can begin RIGHT NOW if you are honest open minded and willing.  
You are not a failure! You know you can do this. Do not allow this relapse to divert you from sobriety. 
This reminds me that we're less than a month away from the 1 year anniversary of P S Hoffman's death. He relapsed and it killed him. No matter how much a "failure" he thought he was his kids would certainly rather have him around. ..You're not dead. Your kids are happy about that. Start there. 
Is the divorce a result of your relapse or did you drink when faced with divorce?
You are not a failure.  You came back here for starters.  It's not how many times you fall it's how many times you get back up.  You said you made hundreds of plans to get better and all of them failed.  At the very least then you know what doesn't work for you...{Courage}.  You can do this.
I give myself 5 minutes of self-pity then it's back to working my program. ..Do you have a program?

Just because you failed doesn't mean everything is ruined. Don't let this shitty feeling be a reason to keep drinking. You has your failure now it's time to get back on the horse.
