One month down! It wasn't easy and I am grateful to have made it this far...As many have done before I want to express my most sincere gratitude to all of you who have shared your stories struggles successes random thoughts etc. I wouldn't have made it one week without having stumbled upon this Subreddit...I wish you all a happy peaceful sober New Year!
