I have struggled for the past 2 years with my dog who is a total and complete love to everybody he knows and everyone at the dog park but acts out aggressively toward strangers at home.  This last week I have realized the connections and triggers he has from being attacked on a leash and how detrimental him being tied up (we don't have a fenced yard) has been to his social skills.  I'm quickly moving on changing his routines to help fix these bad behaviors but I'm certain I wouldn't have figured any of this out had I still been getting drunk and high all the time.  i'm looking forward to nothing but good things in our future...Thanks Sobriety!

I've done a lot of dog rescue/rehab over the years and all I can say is please please don't tie up your dog.  It makes them depressed aggressive and crazy.  Congratulations on your sobriety and remember your dog is depending on you to have a good life.
