Ive been struggling with depression for years now and my psychiatrist laid out the pattern ive been dealing with. He made it clear that alcohol has made the depression i deal with worse and wants me to go to a 90 day residential rehab center. Just wondering if anyone has experience with rehab and could give me some advice. The thoughts im having right now are that i might have had my last drink and that is a scary thing for me as it was my coping mechanism for depression. Any advice would be mich appreciated! Thank you and hope you all are well!

That's great news!..I didn't go to rehab myself but I can certainly attest that years of boozing caused my depression and anxiety to be a squillion times worse than they were to start with even though at the time I'd convinced myself it was helping! I feel much better now after nearly 10 months without a drop.....Best of luck at rehab I hope it will be an excellent start on the road to recovery for you - good luck and keep us posted!..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
I know no-one wants to say it but it doesn't have to be "your last drink". I think it's better to view it as healing yourself...you can always go back to it but you don't always have the ability to get help when you need it. Take it as a blessing. You'll probably feel so much better that you wouldn't dream of wanting to go back to drinking...or Atleast will view it in a different way. Good luck!
