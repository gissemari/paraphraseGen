Wow! congratulations!!!  :)  Keep it up! IWNDWYT!
That's fabulous! So well done...I will not drink with you today.
That's great! Thank you for sharing. You are going to feel so good tomorrow too!  
Bloody marvellous i am in awe ! 
That is so awesome! What a wonderful choice you made! You should be proud. IWNDWYT 
Congratulation! So happy for you. Did you really plan to relapse? ..I am trying to keep that thought away like the devil...IWNDWYTD
That sounds great.  Makes me feel good just reading about it!  IWNDWYT
Keep it up. I'm almost at 150 and I've had  one or two events that I considered relapsing at. But when the time came it just wasn't worth giving up everything I accomplished...I once considered penning a post  Drinking will never be the same . I've come so far in this journey learning so much about how good sobriety feels reflecting on how awful my body and mind felt while deep in the throes of my addiction and humbled at how hard it was at times to get to this point. My point is that I know too much to ever  enjoy  binge drinking like I used to again. It'll never be the same...
Well done!! These events are the most challenging. IWNDWYT
Man I had one night last week where I went bowling and then hung out with friends afterwords and the next day that feeling of not drinking is so much better than I thought it would be. I'm happy for you! 
Brilliant. That's is truly fantastic.  Xx
