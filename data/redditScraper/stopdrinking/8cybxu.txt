The party is in less than a month. We are staying in an awesome old house with an outdoor hot tub! I'm very excited. ..Everyone going likes to drink but they know that I quit. I made it clear from the start that I want this to be about relaxing not partying. Still though I'm so afraid I'm going to relapse. I don't want to drink I know if I do I won't stop and will make an ass out of myself. Because it is my bachelorette party I feel obligated. And just the thought of sitting in that hot tub with a glass of wine is great. But it isn't worth it. I'm afraid I'm going to cave in get drunk and ruin the trip for myself. I hope I stay strong...I will not drink with you today!

Seeing as it's your bachelorette can you not just make it a dry event?
Also congratulations!
I've read a ton of stories about bachelorette  and bachelor parties that were navigated successfully where much fun was had by all.  The stories I read the sober person stocked up on lots of fizzy water or made great mocktails.  You can do it.  IWNDWYT
