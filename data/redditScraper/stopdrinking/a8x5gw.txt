https://imgur.com/a/E5rMJUF..I've shared a quote on here before from the @sobergirlsociety Instagram I highly recommend following this account! Her words just stun me with their beauty and she also has some really funny content...I'm struggling a bit with it being Christmas (I don't feel close to drinking or anything I'm just feeling annoyed that alcohol seems to be EVERYWHERE and I can't wait a tv programme without them showing close up shots of someone pouring a gin - because apparently nobody in the world stays sober at Christmas  )..I'm thinking of all of you on this holiday and wish you a very merry sober and bright Christmas!   Time for me to finish my decorating before pouring myself a nice bitter lemon and ice with some honey roasted peanuts

Thanks for sharing!! I always feel weird following sobriety accounts (which is dumb.. If someone sees they will probably be happy for me) but that seems like a good one!! Followed :)
