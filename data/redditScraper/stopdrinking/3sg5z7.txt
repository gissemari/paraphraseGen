&gt;1) how does something like this happen?..  There is an old saying that alcoholism is cunning baffling and powerful.  I believe this to be true.  My badge says 1862 days....if I am not just as vigilant in my approach to sobriety as I was at Day 1 I firmly believe I will end up like your sister's ex...&gt;2) is there anything I can or should do to help?..  Help who?  Him?  His disease and choices are his own and you are not responsible for them.  With that being said I believe that support and honesty are the two most important things.  You badge says 17 days.  If you are trying to get sober and recovery you should be putting that first and foremost.  **Do not risk your sobriety by getting involved in another alcoholic's problems.**..&gt;3) should I still stay in contact with him or not?..  See #s 1 and 2 above...&gt;4) what do you guys/gals do to make sure something like this never happens to you personally?..  I try to work a proactive program of recovery on a daily basis.  In my opinion if I am not moving forward with sobriety and recovery then I know I will slide backwards.  People here are big believers in the baby steps and they are a wonderful introduction to sobriety.  What many people fail to get in my opinion is that there are more to the baby steps than just don't drink today.  If my recovery was simply "I'm not going to drink today" and I did nothing else to address my disease of alcoholism there is no way I would be sober today.  I needed to take proactive steps to get better and ensure that I don't relapse...Sorry to hear about your friend and good luck to you! 
Realistically 2 years isn't that long in recovery. And 95% of recovering alcoholics do eventually return to booze. It's sad but it's an actual statistic. Don't beat yourself up over it. But like it was already said you shouldn't put your own sobriety at risk. It has to be his choice.
I was sober for 15 years and then I relapsed.  It took me another 7 years to get back to recovery.  Why did I relapse?  Two things that I attribute to my relapse: I stopped going to recovery meetings; and I harbored a mental reservation that I wasn't an alcoholic.  ..I no longer harbor that reservation.  I totally embrace my sober life and all that it entails including active recovery.  I do the things that I enumerate at the [Baby Steps post to maintain my sober streak.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)
Came here to say what /u/Nika65 said about the "cunning baffling and powerful" part. Alcohol IS all these things and relapse is a frustrating and prevalent problem with us drunks. A wizened old guy in a meeting once said that alcohol is an 800 pound gorilla waiting for us in the parking lot and we better fear and respect him. I would offer him a hand when he gets out if he was my friend as long as he wasn't drinking. Best of luck to you- 17 what a great number! 
For a while I thought I had a PhD in relapse. Seriously I fell hard. After 12 years sober I jumped off the wagon and went my merry way to enjoy life as a "functional alcoholic" (so they say). For 10 years. It proved catastrophic. Luckily I came back 5 years ago but all of that ordeal is not the topic...There are not that many reasons behind my relapse: I simply did not do what had to be done in order to keep my condition in check. Here his what I did sort of OK: avoid the first drink go to plenty of AA meetings cumulate as many tasks is AA as I could...Here is what I did not do: understand and assimilate the 12 steps deal with the hard issues that had twisted my brain and develop genuine connections with other alcoholics...After some time money and prestige came back so did the ego and the mean spirited behaviour. ..So. To answer your first and fourth questions (they are related) I would say that my pitfall was to pick and chose the parts of rehab that I liked and ignore the rest. You can imagine that this time around I open my mind much more that my mouth...As for your questions two &amp; three I respectfully suggest you focus on your own recovery. Your ex-brother in law is in rehab. Good for him. Now: Convert your soon to be three weeks into three months one day at a time. Then move on. And don't leave rocks unturned. One of mine came back to bite me after a few years. I hope you enjoy the journey as much as I now do.
To address your points:..1) That's kind of hard to say because the reason will vary so much from individual to individual. That little voice creeps up in a lot of our heads and says things like "You deserve just one! You've been so good! See you put it down for so long you won't have any problem putting it down again!"..2) Should do? Probably (Edit:) not. Sounds like he is getting help from professionals. Can do? Maybe be there to listen. Point him here encourage recovery. But I wouldn't recommend forcing the issue. Hell it's being shoved down his throat right now so maybe not even bring it up...3) I want to be clear that I very much respect /u/Nika65 and he has given me some great advice in the past. And he has a much longer sober track record than myself. However I am going to disagree very strongly with this statement:..&gt; If you are trying to get sober and recovery you should be putting that first and foremost. Do not risk your sobriety by getting involved in another alcoholic's problems...Now as for the reason why I disagree it comes down to how important/challenging your own sobriety is to you. You said:..&gt;Even though I was never that ridiculous of a drinker and my marriage is still strong watching their marriage fall apart followed by the great changes he has made in his life over the last couple years was one of the factors that convinced me to quit drinking too...So if you just looked at his life and took inspiration but it's not a *constant struggle* for you to deal with alcohol then I would not worry about him being a negative influence. Especially if he was a positive one to begin with...I cannot imagine not being there for a friend due to the problems they *might* cause me. If I am sitting at home and my friend calls me from the side of the road with a flat tire I am not going to refuse to go help him because I **might** have a car wreck on the way. ..4) Also individual to individual. I mentioned that voice in point 1. I have learned (and it will hopefully stick) to ignore that voice. I hate the term "recovering alcoholic" for a lot of reasons. I prefer to thing of it as "sobriety in training". You have to keep yourself vigilant. Just as one fast food burger won't make you obese one beer won't send you into oblivion. BUT: most of us can't/won't stop there. And by the time we make it to this sub at least part of us knows that...
Sometimes a persons demons can get the better of them.
I have similar concerns. All we can do is decide whether or not we want to drink today. I'm guessing that some people start to think "I've got this" after a few years but really their ability to drink moderately hasn't improved. ..My relationship with alcohol with the exception of a couple years early on has always been unmanageable. If I try to drink again in twenty years I assume things will be very similar to how they were when I stopped. It's hard to wrap my head around that idea though. ..All I know about is today. I might not even be alive in 5 10 20 years so why worry about it? Or I might be a space assasin in a galaxy where alcohol isn't even a thing.  
1) how does something like this happen? .For me I had stopped going to meetings was not in contact with my sponsor or any of the other guys in my support network.  When I had an existential crisis I had none of the tools that a person who stayed close to the program and fellowship would have had.  I pissed away 10 years and 7 months of sobriety.  There are guys who went through what I went through and didn't drink...4) what do you guys/gals do to make sure something like this never happens to you personally?.I am an object lesson in what NOT to do.  (See above.)  It works if you work it and it won't if you don't.
