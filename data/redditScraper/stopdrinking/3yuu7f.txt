I've been an off and on hard drinker since age 15-16. Frequency has fluctuated but always trended towards more and more often and damn near always binge drinking provided supplies were available. ..Well I pulled it off somehow. I'm 80% through air force pilot training which has been my dream. Guess what though? I'm drinking a truly dangerous amount now and I would like to quit before I blow it all...In a way i envy those who got a DUI (i deserve to have) or went to prison (ditto) as it forces them to reevaluate and get some sort of help. My hardest part has been functioning fine otherwise but sapping all possible happiness out of the great life i've built. It's been sooo easy to rationalize my problem but I can see it is an addiction and an all-or-nothing one (at least for now) with me...I don't see AA as something that would work for me so I figured I'd start here....EDIT--The actual questions:.Where do non AAers go who don't have time for rehab or anything?.What do you do when you have cravings but no sponsor?.What other tips would you have for someone just starting who is serious but always struggles around week 2-3?.Lastly what do you tell people????..PS: You guys are great for what you do. Truly.

Granted I am only on day 3 right now but what has worked for me so far is to set small goals. "Today I will not drink. Today instead of drinking I will do X Y or z." I tell myself if I really want to drink I will drink tomorrow but I will not drink today. I've seen others say the same so for a lot of us it works!..Best of luck to you. You can do it. It's worth it for your health and your air force training.

Welcome glad you're here!  I do find that AA works for me along with SD.  I am someone who really needs the accountability and community.
I was able to start stopping by doing the things I describe at the [Baby Steps link.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  I'm an atheist-agnostic AAer but I go to AA meetings and I find them easily accessible and a great place to find a recovery path.
