I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who posts here. I've struggled with sobriety most of my life (two weeks till I turn the big 3-0 and haven't been 8 days sober since high school) and wanted to share something positive that happened today. ..Today was by far the hardest day since I stopped drinking. My dream job of the last 5 years is ending and I started clearing out my office and putting all my pictures/desk stuff in boxes. Rough. But before I left for the day and headed to the liquor store to drink myself stupid I came here. After a few inspiring stories the urge had passed. All the way home I kept thinking of how far I've come already and how inspiration to stay sober is always there(here). Came home to read some more posts and figured I'd make my first. ..So thank you all again and keep up the amazing work everybody...

Welcome /u/stratyturd out of lurkerdom.  Why don't you stick around and consider doing the 30 day sober challenge?
That is so cool! I got fired on the day I found out I was pregnant I'm still shocked I didn't relapse now always look back at that day as my biggest triumph yet...Good for you!
I'm sorry about the job but that's awesome you didn't drink man think how good you'll feel tomorrow when you wake up sober instead of hung over. I turned 30 at the end of last month and drank myself into a stupor on my birthday. You're not missing out on anything by not doing that and staying sober instead.
