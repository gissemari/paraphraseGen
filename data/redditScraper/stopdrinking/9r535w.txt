I've been sober from alcohol for quite some time.  All that gusto from initially quitting and the running and constant working out has faded.  ..Somehow I'm smoking cigarettes now and I can't even believe it.  Feel like my life is lacking in purpose.  My desires to conquer the world is over and I feel like I've detached from the need to make money.  ..Less is more.  Struggling to find out what makes me happy now.  Rebuilding life without the ego and attachments is hard I won't lie.  It's a process.  Getting out of bed and even showering some days is an accomplishment.  ..Some days I feel great and excel.  Feel like life passed me by in a sense.  I'm 38 now.  I've had 2 incredibly successful runs over the last 20 years each lasting about 10 years.  Managed to run the businesses into the ground and have very little to show for myself.  ..It did teach me that money is the root of all evil and money can't make me happy.  This endless pursuit of  success  no longer makes me happy.  It's just a means to an end.  Trying to find balance.  One day at a time right ? I ..didn't know where else to post so I thought I would drop by.  Certainly my life is better now without alcohol ... putting down the booze started an entirely new process in my life. I'm at a cross roads now.  I'm grateful and hoping that whatever I meant to be happens now.  ..

Perhaps you can use your new vitality to help others. Turning your attention away from yourself and towards servicing humanity can provide a lot of greater meaning.
Hey I'm your age and been sober for a short while as well. Having same kind of emotions as you. I feel kind of blah about everything. No ambition or emotion. I'm running a business that's actually doing really well - but I can't wait for the end of the day so I can go home eat some dinner and pass out. A lot of times I make an excuse to get the F home. The old me would be at work having beers with my team and then pumping myself full of caffeine the next day to push through the hangover. I'm just tired and the only emotion I get is anxiety thinking of not being able to drink or how I've ruined my body. I'm hoping it gets better I've been forcing myself to work out which sort of helps. I'm in a very competitive space and I'm afraid I'm going to let down my team that I worked so hard to recruit and investors that have poured a lot of money in this venture - having thoughts that maybe I need to find someone to replace me and go take yoga lessons drinking tea somewhere for a few years until this shit subsides.
