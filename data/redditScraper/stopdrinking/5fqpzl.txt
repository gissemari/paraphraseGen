Mid-September I stopped drinking and made it 46 days before deciding I would have "just one" and I am now back to buying bottles of 3-Buck Chuck and sneak-drinking a random beer at noon on a weekend.  I can't for the life of me remember what made me pick up that first drink and break my streak but now I am disappointed in myself...But I am going to start again...It's funny - as soon as I had that first drink or two I stopped going to the gym as regularly and became irritable and sad. How do these events not connect in my mind until 3:30 am after a binge session?..Anyway I'm back. Hi guys. x

Hello /u/hipopokamu and welcome back. I am curious what you have learned about yourself and your relationship with alcohol. Having the support of a therapist and AA gave me tools to not take that first drink. What are you going to do differently this time?
I got sober beginning of Sept made it 58 days. Started my routine beers after work for all of this month. Didnt drink Thanksgiving. So all this month on and off the wagon. Im on again as of today. I wanna see a sober December for starters. But working on this hour right now. Birds of a feather? Lets get sober and live healthy and strong!! I wont drink with you today 
Good to have you back.  Let's do this thing!  One day at a time.
