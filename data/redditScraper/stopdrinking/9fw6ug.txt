*I want to start off by saying that if you are in a vulnerable or early stage in recovery please don't read this because I don't want to trigger a relapse.*..If you are still reading however here's what's been going down. On the outside my life actually looks pretty decent especially for someone my age (25 years old). I have a new job in a tech startup finishing up a Master's degree and I recently came back from a trip to Spain. However the simple fact is that I am unbearably lonely. I have a lot of friends/acquaintances but have never to this day had an actual long term girlfriend. And this shit eats at me every second of every day. Even if someone asks me "do you have a girlfriend" or talks about how many people they've hooked up with it sends me into a very dark spiral of depression and self-loathing. I somehow ingrained the notion into my mind (to a borderline delusional extent) that I will never be intimate with a woman again and that I wasted all my chances to do so. So much so that I have even considered chemical castration as a way to just stop being miserable (i.e. if I kill all sexual desire I can finally focus on what makes me happy since I obviously am not going to use it). The thing is when I tell people this they just say I am being stupid. And so the main reason I drink is to forget this loneliness. I also have ocd and major depressive disorder so I understand those are underlying factors as well. But I don't know what to do. I feel like I will relapse at any moment and don't even have high hopes about finding a good therapist. Honestly I feel super ungrateful writing this because so many people have it way way worse than I do. And also I have delayed writing this post for a while because I think secretly I just didn't want to have people hold me accountable if I drink. But I am at my wit's end. Thank you for reading.

It might be better to ask for advice in r/relationships but I can assure you that you haven't passed your prime. Maybe back in the 1950's people were expected to start a family when they are twenty but I can assure you that there are males and females in the same situation you are in. ..I can't help much in this department but it seems that you might want to find one or two things you could learn to make yourself interesting and then check out  meetup  or  itsjustlunch . ..Good luck bud.

Whatever issues you have one thing is certain. Drinking makes it worse. ..You are still very young. It is not at all unusual for people of your age not to have a relationship. And there are people in their sixties and seventies starting relationships. .I assume you have seen a psychiatrist about your depression. If so you may need a change in medication. 
Hey love I'm sorry you are feeling so horrible. Wish I could give you a big hug. People like us know a loneliness that is deep and terrible and maybe even deadly. I don't think anyone knows loneliness like alcoholics and depressed people do. But you aren't alone and you are loved. I thought I was going to be alone forever for a long time. Right when I gave up I met someone who actually cares about me. It happened when I least expected it I had given up on that part of life forever. It will happen for you too. But you need to be okay in yourself. There is no shame in what you are describing. You're not bad or lame or pathetic or anything like that. You have nothing to be ashamed of. I know it hurts right now but please try and take care of yourself. Much love.
