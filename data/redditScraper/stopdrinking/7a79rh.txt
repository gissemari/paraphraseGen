I am in need of a candid hilariously written and often sarcastic book/piece of writing that I can draw inspiration from. I'd love for any recommendations anybody can make for something that you think I would love to read...Basic facts about me: Age 35 female overweight (bloody obese more like) based in the UK desperate to get a handle on this poisonous crap I keep throwing down my throat...Attitude toward alcohol:  The sole reason to drink it is to get drunk.  I see zero point in  one glass  of anything.  I can  happily  abstain for periods of time (most is 69 days   I'm aware that this is beyond pathetic) however when I drink I partake in boozing that would put George Best (RIP) and Gazza to shame.  Current location is in Purgatory with many days on and off the booze.  I have gained SO much weight in recent years that I imagine is largely attributable to booze.  I have an ever increasing pain around my liver that goes away completely when I don't drink.  Whilst I can kid myself that this may be my gallbladder and not my liver I know that it's alcohol related.  I am intelligent enough to know that I shouldn't drink especially when I have a PAIN NEAR MY LIVER?!  I am confident and outgoing.  I also struggle with severe anxiety.   I'm also an intolerant bitch.  Not only do I not suffer fools gladly I'd gladly punch them in the face (I've never done this!).  This level of aggression and intolerance does reduce when I don't drink.  So there's another reason NOT TO DRINK...The anxiety is the worst thing for me.  If I thought that stopping the booze would rid me of this anxiety  I simply wouldn't hesitate.  However I haven't heard any inspirational stories recently regarding alcohol and anxiety; I merely read about the  possible links  between the two.  Does anyone have any real life experience of this?..I need real life tough examples.   Something has to change.  I wake up feeling sick in the early hours then again around 7ish and I am TOTALLY CONVINCED that I won't drink again.  A few hours later and I'm back on it...WTAF?..I've been reading stuff for a while and have a few firm favourites.  I'm really just looking for any reading that I may not know about...All suggestions welcome please : ) I don't want to feel and look like an alcoholic rhino anymore.  : )

Hey and Welcome! Although I didn't find these books hilarious I was totally able to *relate* to them - and I did actually laugh a lot at how much I had in common with the authors. Here's our link to Book Recommendations: https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/books...Perhaps others will jump in with other suggestions; but in the interim this should be a good start. Glad you're here!
Hi. Fellow female alcoholic rhino here -- although much less rhino-like now that I am not drinking. Also -- my level of anxiety has gone down **enormously** since I stopped. It's really almost gone...I really enjoyed the memoir "Dry" by Augusten Burroughs.
Hi there!..I've really enjoyed the blog [Mrs D is Going Without](http://livingwithoutalcohol.blogspot.ie/)... Might be the sort of thing you are looking for.....Annie Grace's [*This Naked Mind*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4KpBxerD_BIksjUfUT4hVw/videos) YouTube channel has really helped me and her book of the same name is highly recommended around here.... [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YoAglovRc4) might be a good starting point......There's a [reading list](https://np.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/books) on the sidebar too which might have a few titles you'd be interested in.....The link between a long-term heavy drinking habit and anxiety is pretty incontrovertible in my opinion because of the way that alcohol interacts with the brain chemistry and the way that the brain responds by changing the balance of neurotransmitters to compensate.... My anxiety was horrific by the end of my drinking years but it's so much better now......Hope that helps!..Stick around and keep us posted on how you're doing?..Best wishes ..Woody :&gt;)&gt;

Hello &amp; Welcome :-)..I liked Sober Stick Figure by Amber Tozer...Regarding anxiety and alcohol. I suffer from anxiety since my younger years most importantly pre my drinking career. Throw in the occasional panic attack and top it of with some agoraphobia. I can assure you that alcohol made all this almost unmanageable. Now that I am sober I still have the occasional anxiety attack but not the &gt;&gt;OMG&lt;&lt; I am going to die anxiety I used to have when waking up after a night of drinking. This anxiety was not the regret of drinking but pure physical &amp; mental terror. All this is gone now!.
 Blackout  by Sarah Hepola. It's awesome. Get it read it like right now. Also I second  Dry. 
My anxiety decreased massively since putting a cork in the bottle. 
32 year old male here. I really enjoyed "I Swear I'll Make It Up to You" by Mishka Shubaly. He also had a Kindle single called "The Long Run".     
Hey youboozeyoulooze! I'm a little late to this thread but I do have a suggestion. I have been binge reading sobriety books for the past few months it helps even if the book is mediocre. Two books by the same author (Glennon Doyle Melton) had me rolling on the ground laughing: Love Warrior and Carry On Warrior: The Power of Embracing Your Messy Beautiful Life. ..However side point. The title of your thread sounds like a book I'd totally want to read. So you may consider starting your sobriety e-book titled "Tired of Being A Bloated Lush With A Mouth That Tastes Like A Drain." I'll be sure to purchase it on pre-order :).
