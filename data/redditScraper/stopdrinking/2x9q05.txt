I'm hoping to get your thoughts and advice on those big decisions.  I'm 40 male alcoholic (drinking or smoking pot for the past 10 years but mostly drinking toward the end) been sober with scattered days of relapse over the past 6 months sober now for 14 days been going to AA for 3 months go to meetings everyday have a sponsor and am on step 9.  My alcoholic drinking coincides with getting married and starting work as a lawyer about 10 years ago.  I have been divorced for 4 years recently broke up with my girlfriend (hence my latest relapse) and am single for the first time in my adult live.  I have been unemployed for 15 months and am $50k in debt.  I cut out work and believe this period of unemployment was necessary for me to admit and deal with my alcoholism.  I broke up with my girlfriend because it was an unhealthy relationship and contributing to my relapses.  But now (after 15 months of unemployment 2 weeks of being single 6 months of intermittent sobriety and 2 weeks of solid sobriety) I feel like I need to start filling my life with things.  I go to AA meetings exercise read spend time with family and do general life stuff but I'm getting restless.  ..WORK:  I feel like I need to work because I need the money and think it would be good for me to try to function normally.  But I'm afraid the stress of working as a lawyer will be too much.  I think I have an irrational fear of it because my alcoholic drinking coincides with starting work.  I'm thinking of going back to school for a MFT to become a therapist but the program doesn't start until this fall and will take 2 years and another $60k. ..DATE:  I have always had a girlfriend or wife in my life and I have relied on that for support etc.  I know it's good for me to learn to be okay on my own and that I'm supposed to wait for one year of sobriety but I'm not great at friendships get lonely easily and would really love to find the right woman to spend my life with.  ..MOVE:  I have a great relationship with my parents.  Moving in with them would help with my debt and keep me from getting lonely but would feel weird at my age and would obviously get in the way of my dating prospects. ..Thanks in advance.

Well here is the deal. First off you are going to hear a lot of what other people have done to be successful and that doesn't necessarily mean it is what YOU have to do but it would most likely be in your best interest...Working is important for a lot of people. It gives us something to be proud of and it earns us income which we of course need. Life is going to keep coming whether you are sober or not. I would say get a job again an just keep going to AA and abstaining from alcohol. I realize it is stressful but you are going to need income...Dating is generally not recommended in early sobriety. Part of getting sober is finding yourself. Seeing who you are and what you like without drinking and drugging. Getting sober is also an emotional roller coaster and submitting other people to deal with that is pretty unfair in my opinion...Moving in with your parents wouldn't be horrible but could be avoided if you started working which to me seems like a no brainer but I don't know your situation entirely. If you did move in with them then you could both work and eliminate the dating aspect because to be honest dating isn't going to be necessary no matter how difficult that can seem...This is my opinion.
In rehab we were advised to not get into a relationship for at least the first year of sobriety. After seeing what some of the people around me went through after getting into relationships I understand the advice. Once we begin to heal and learn to love ourselves we can learn to love others. I was a ego-driven selfish individual for a very long time and it would have been very hard to maintain a relationship. ..Working really helped me stay sober. I spent years underemployed and all the free time kept me relapsing. You could possibly try getting a temp job outside of your profession just to get used to working again and save up some $ and pay off debt. Once you get some more sober time and a little $ you could try getting back into working as a lawyer...Not sure about the moving in with parents thing. Have you considered moving into a Sober Living Environment? They tend to be very affordable and a great help in staying sober as well as get to know some new friends in recovery. ..Let us know what you decide and stay strong....
Those are really tough decisions and unfortunately I don't think I can help you. I just want to comment on the one about dating/loneliness and say that I'm also feeling really lonely sometimes but I think it's really important that you learn to deal with the loneliness. You can't keep hiding from yourself and your feelings by smoking pot or drinking alcohol. I'm not saying that you should stop socialising or anything but I do think that it would be a great thing for you to realize that it's actually OK to be bored sometimes. Maybe you should try meditation?..Well it sounds like your on the right path and I hope the best for you!
**Work:** I think you're smart to see this as a risk if it's a risk to you. Is there some way you can ease into it? Part time? Or maybe decide to work in a different field for some defined period of time?...**Relationship:** I'm not going to repeat the point about relationships and the first year of not drinking. I think it's smart and I didn't follow it to my regret. ..Instead here's an observation: You blame in part at least your relapses on the breakup of your relationship. This rings several bells for me. ..First not drinking and being sober should not be dependent on somebody else and their presence or absence. (Yes I'm making a blanket generalization and saying *should not.*) I think it makes us vulnerable and I think it's a cop-out that is harmful because it keeps us from addressing our sobriety as something that we have to own. ..Second you're saying that a relationship status can make you drink at this point and you ask whether it's a good idea to seek another relationship. Based on this logic alone I would say clearly not a good idea because by your own description taking on the risks of a relationship (it might not work out) puts you at risk for drinking. ..Third I don't know what scattered relapses but mostly sober means. That may be my problem. I think of sober as a state of being not just what I'm doing today. It sounds to me more like: I don't drink on most days and some days I do drink. You describe these as relapses but I don't know if that means that when you do drink you have one or two drinks; or that you drink only occasionally but when you do it's blackout. That's relevant. But in either case I wouldn't call drinking occasionally as being sober because alcohol is in your life. I truly don't mean this as a judgement--just kind of a check on what we're really talking about. It sounds to me like you're working on not drinking and that's great but it really sounds like this is a work in progress. I don't think throwing dating into the mix is doing yourself any favors when not drinking is so tenuous. ..**Move in with parents:** This sounds like a good idea for some defined period of time. Save some money pay off debts help them out--not forever but for a specific period as part of an overall plan. Not that I could do it but if I could it would help if I knew that for example I'm going to do this for one year and by doing it I'll be able to pay off $20K in debt that I would have paid in rent--that's a plan. ..I hope you take this in the spirit I offer it which is constructive and not critical. Maybe this is too far out on a limb but I think you're asking because maybe you know the answers and might not like them because they're uncomfortable. I'm thinking that the discomfort might be a positive sign of progress. 
Hi there /u/willingtoaccept.  I just wanted to share my experience on the loneliness/dating question as it struck close to home for me.  I'm an alcoholic divorced mother of 2.  Until a year ago I had never been single for more that a few weeks.  ..Less than a month into sobriety I went on a few dates realized that the energetic expense of getting involved with someone was NOT something I was ready or willing to do despite the loneliness.  ..I've been in therapy for more than a year now and I've recently realized that I'm at a place where I actually **want** to welcome all those unpleasant feelings that I used to soothe away with alcohol a relationship or just sex.  It's my hope that by doing this I'll actually be able to get free of the emotional wounds that keep dragging me down and make me repeat the same painful laps around the same well-worn track. ..Maybe just maybe I'll be able to tap into that greatness of human beings that /u/KetoJam shared with us in [Today's quote](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2x71fv/thursdays_quote/) and recreate myself...Then [the sunny promise](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2ul8ff/my_exhusband_got_married_and_didnt_tell_me/co9f7km) suggested to me by /u/PJMurphy might just be realized...But as for now I'm in no rush.  I wish the same feeling for you as you sort through your big decisions.  Let me share one more link with you something that calms me in those moments when to sort out my entire life all at once.  I think [this is worth a watch] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co04vu635_M) just for the music and visuals alone but Alan Watts's words don't hurt either.  :)..We've got all the time in the world...edit:  formatting..
