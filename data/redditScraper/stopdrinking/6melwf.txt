I work at a restaurant and I'm fairly close with my sober coworkers.  Well they're all drinking/using and lying to me about it.  How do I know? Because they all privately tattled on each other to me insisting that they were the only 'clean' one.  Now that I'm paying close attention what I wrote off as a 'bad night's sleep' or 'feeling down' or 'using hand sanitizer' is clearly alcohol or drug related...I don't give a fuck that they're struggling with substance use and I don't even care that they're hiding it from me.  But I'm really mad about the self righteous lying and tattling.  Frankly I feel like I'm being used in their addiction games...Obviously I have not expressed any of this because I don't want to make them feel worse and ironically I don't want to betray their confidence.  I'm sure that they are all miserable unable to think clearly and making decisions they'd never make sober.   ..I'm genuinely sorry to see them in this state and I'm rooting for them to make it through.  But damn am I frustrated!

Working in the industry you realize that a lot of people are struggling with substance use disorders.  What I do is listen to my coworkers (or more often my employees) and offer them support *if they want it*.  I know that I can't control their behavior (unless they show up drunk or high I will not stand for that kinda wish some of my old bosses had been less forgiving in hindsight) and show them a good example of the benefits of sobriety.  One of my bartenders told me yesterday that he drove drunk (a friend had a pocket breathalizer and he blew .3 something) amd told me confidently that he was an excellent driver when drunk.  I calmly replied that everyone thinks they are a great drunk driver right up to the minute they kill someone or get stopped by police.  I guess what I'm saying is I don't create an environment where people feel like they need to hide their use from me but rather one where they can talk about their issues if they want or need to.  Maybe try asking them how they are doing make sure they know that you are supportive not judging them.   It works well for me
