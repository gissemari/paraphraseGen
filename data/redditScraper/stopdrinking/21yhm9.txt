Whilst reading Viktor Frankl's book I found a motivational passage that relates to alcoholism that I wanted to share as encouragement to folks struggling. "Live life as if you were living for the second time." Learn to forgive the past relearn how to love yourself and continue the beautiful struggle without alcohol.

One thing for sure is I had to start all over again!  Good book.
I just wrote this down. Thanks for the quote!
I really like that.  Thank you!
Nice! I am definitely living life for the second time around but on a totally different path that is bordered with wildflowers rather than quicksand. I feel like what someone who almost died must feel...like every second of life I am given is a gift that I am grateful for.

big woop that's bullshit. Love that book though.
Just went looking for it on my bookshelf and moved it to my top spot. I've been slogging my way through Thomas Merton - the man is brilliant but his sentences are dense and windy.
That's very beautiful. Thanks - it has been 25 years since I read that book; I should read it again. ..An aside - I recall around that time (college) there was an Auschwitz exhibit in Atlanta. Part of it was a video installation featuring an interview with a man who survived the camp; he lived in my neighborhood and I had walked past his house hundreds of times. This made history real to me in a way that the other parts of the exhibit could not do.
