Four months! Almost can't believe it. I started getting sober in Dec 2015 and it took me two years of sober - lapse - sober - lapse - relapse - sober etc ON LOOP to get here...Feeling so good today. Facing the hard shit in my life and feeling so many emotions trying to build relationships fix my finances work through childhood trauma. It is so tough at times to have to feel it all and not numb out. But it's so so worth it. After two years I feel like I'm starting to get it like sobriety has stuck...Good luck to everyone on the path. I will not drink with you today.
