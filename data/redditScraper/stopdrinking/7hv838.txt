So today marks my first week sober and I thought I would share how being sober this week has affected me...The first thing I would like to say is this sub has helped a lot! I've been coming here everyday and just reading people's stories has not only opened my eyes more of what alcohol can do it helped me look back on my own experiences and see how alcohol has effected me. So thank you to everybody here for sharing your thoughts and stories!..One of the biggest changes I've noticed is the sleep....I used to drink myself to sleep by 12-1 am and since I've quit I haven't fallen asleep earlier then 5 am. But I don't count this as a negative for a couple reasons first I've been getting A LOT of stuff done that I had put off while drinking and second even though I've been waking up around the same time as when I was drinking (around 9) I still feel 100x better then waking up hungover!!..Another change I've noticed is the clarity. Maybe I'm just lucky because I know a lot of people struggle through the first week but for me it has been oddly therapeutic. I've been spending a lot of my time reflecting on the mistakes I've made and where I want to end up in the future things that when I was drinking I never really thought about before...One of the last things I've noticed is how much more I've been enjoying the smaller things like my commute to work and shopping. I used to loathe these things before but now I use that time to think and clear my head...While I would say this week has been very good for me I still have that little devil in my head telling me things like "look at how easy this is Even if you start drinking again you will just be a normal drinker!" Or "it's Friday night and you are just going to sit around the house and do nothing!? Aren't you bored!? Let's go out and get a drink!!"..So all in all that's one week down and here's to another week! ..I will not drink with you all today.
