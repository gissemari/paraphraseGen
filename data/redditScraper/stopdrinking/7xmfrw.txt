Made it to 100 days for the first time in nearly 10 years! Shout out to SD for being here! Having the ticker really helps keep me motivated and hearing of everyone else's struggles and triumphs keeps me inspired. ..If you are just beginning your journey stay strong and know that it does get easier. I don't think about drinking much anymore but the occasional craving will creep up. Only now I feel I have the tools to deal with it now. ..I definitely feel healthier although I do have other bad unhealthy habits I need to address. I didn't realize how often I wouldn't eat and drink instead until I wasn't eating and there was no booze to block out my bodies cry for nutrition...This transfers over to many other aspects too. My mental health has improved but now there's no buffer on it. Same goes for my fears and anxieties. They come with no filter now. This is one aspect I've heard echoed by many on this sub. We're all fighting. We win we lose but regardless we carry on. ..Thanks for the support random family of internet sobernauts!!..IWNDWYT!!!.
