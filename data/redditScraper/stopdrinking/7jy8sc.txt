The only thing that any one of us can do is to tell you to see a doctor. We have strict rule against seeking medical advice on this site because no one here is qualified to give it. Withdrawal can be dangerous even deadly and should be supervised by a professional. You might try calling the National Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357) and see if they can give you support.
