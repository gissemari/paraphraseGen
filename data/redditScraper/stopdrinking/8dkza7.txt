Posted on here the first time a couple months ago or so.  I'd been able to convince myself I didn't have a problem since it didn't have an effect on my social or work life I had the money for it and the only things I ever felt while drinking were either happiness or drowsiness...I was starting to drink scary amounts of alcohol though and knew it was only a matter of time before serious health problems would occur if I kept it up...You guys helped me recognize a couple problems and I started tapering down.  Had way too many times where 'tapering' resulted in 'just one more tonight' though...Thankfully though I have supportive friends that I've been sharing the struggle with and friends and family in medical professions that could keep an eye on me so!  ..24 hours since my last drink haven't been completely sober at this time of night in a long time and honestly feeling really good...Just running into that whole thing with having trouble falling asleep that so many people have talked about...Going to make sure I get more exercise and some time in the sun tomorrow.  Keep eating healthy.  And I'm about to be given a 'prescription' of a little Melatonin and give the bed a shot again...Just wanted to stop by here and say thanks first for the part you guys played in helping me start stopping.

Welcome.  Tell us how you are doing.  I had success taking melatonin valarian root and gaba last year.  After blood work hair and urine analysis my nutritionist put me on a bunch of supplements whole food supplements.  Sleep got good within a week this time around.  Kind of cool to get the assays first and use that information to see what if any thing is needed.  IWNDWYT
