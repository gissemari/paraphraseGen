tl;dr for this entire post:  this is a long rant from someone long-terrified of asking for help and even longer-convinced I could quit by myself if I just tried hard enough and read enough books.  If this rant doesn't piss off a lot of people I probably didn't do it right...tl;dr more specifically: if you have a job bite the fucking bullet and take medical leave and commit to quitting 100%.  Half-measures don't work.  It is worth risking your job your reputation and your finances to get sober.  You *will* lose your pride to get sober.  Get over it.  The only other alternatives to sobriety are jail or death with abject misery preceding each...But here's my long story and for the first time ever in my struggle with alcohol I *know* I have found my way to what will work for me.  I might fuck up again but if I do it will be because I lost my way and I will still *know* the way back to sobriety:..Finally I was verging on suicidal and so said fuck it and wrote an email to the entire management and coworkers saying "effective immediately I am on indefinite medical leave."  LOL.  No explanation at all just did it and figured I'd deal with the consequences later.  My devious evil alcoholic mind knew that by claiming medical leave they couldn't just fire me immediately they'd have to give me time to get a doctor's note etc. which I intended to do.  And that's what I ended up doing...I have Kaiser Permanente HMO and they have a chemical dependency treatment program that I checked into basically at a walk-in urgent care type thing.  I was immediately seen by a therapist for an evaluation of hospitalization versus outpatient.  (PS I set a personal best on the breathalyzer at 0.305 at 1pm and this had been a relatively light day of drinking what with being driven to the hospital and sitting in a waiting room for a bit.  Curious what I'd typically score by the time I pass out.)..The very next day while still on withdrawal meds (which are a fucking MIRACLE at mitigating withdrawal symptoms) they put me into these group meetings with other alkies/addicts in early recovery.  In order to get my doctor's note they forced me to go to multiple group meetings per day every day.  I had no choice if I wanted any possibility of keeping my job so I did it...Picture anywhere from 10 to 30 of us alkies/addicts in a room with 1-3 therapists leading the discussion.  The meetings start with a vow of confidentiality - what you say hear or see in here stays here.  The therapist throws out a topic and asks people to share.  Unlike AA they strongly strongly discourage letting anyone pass.  They "make you" say something even if you just say this is bullshit.  At least explain why it's bullshit and that's an acceptable response.  The topics discussed and the format of the meeting however is clearly taken straight from AA.  And you know why?  Because alkies/addicts all share a lot of fucking psychological issues in common so it's easy to get a room full of them talking about it when everyone in the room knows that what is said there stays there...Unlike AA cross-talk and questions from one group member to another are allowed and encouraged as long as it's not negative or accusatory or belligerent etc.  Unlike AA the word God is not written on the wall anywhere and is never a topic the therapist will bring up for group discussion.  Unlike AA they don't focus on the 12 steps.  So the atheists/agnostics can't use these issues as an excuse to go it alone...This was huge for me.  In my half-assed attempt at AA I always secretly knew in my heart I'd never do the 12 steps and I didn't give a shit about the God thing either way.  But now I didn't have that excuse and I was *forced* to go to several meetings per day.  After a week I fucking *enjoyed* going to the meetings.  No shit.  I fucking enjoyed them!  **I had the epiphany that this alcoholism shit is not about fucking alcohol** it's about a psychological or spiritual or character defect or whatever you want to call it.  Whatever you call it it is something **you have to confront head on and talk about HONESTLY with other people**.  I know that is fucking scary it is terrifying.  But it is the only way at least for me...I am now going to AA meetings all the time when I'm not going to my mandatory Kaiser meetings.  Here's the rub: when it was in the medical context at Kaiser I was will willing to just give up my ego and do whatever the fuck they told me to do no questions asked.  After a week of that I had the epiphany that "holy shit what they are telling me to do is working but they aren't telling me to do anything except for talk to other alcoholics with more sobriety time than you have!."  Gee why does that concept sound familiar?  ..I am now diving head first into AA in ADDITION to my mandatory meetings and doing what sober alcoholics tell me to do.  No questions asked just like I did what the therapists told me to do no questions asked.  I had to completely abandon my pride and ego and ability to be embarrassed by discussing *with other people* my character defects fears lies past bad actions etc...I was and remain hugely shy and this was so fucking terrifying to do that I can't put it into words.  But each meeting it gets easier.  If you are lucky enough to have access to a chemical dependency treatment program FUCKING DO IT ALREADY.  ..If you don't have access to a chemical dependency treatment program and you have repeatedly failed quitting on your own fucking bite the bullet and go to AA as often as you can and *participate* no matter how uncomfortable it makes you feel.  Don't worry about the steps for now.  Just go there and share your feelings and fears and character flaws openly and honestly with other people and I fucking promise you when you look up after talking you will see people nodding their head and smiling in knowing agreement...tl;dr stop being such a pussy like I was and find a group of other alkies/addicts with whom you can share in person your deepest darkest fears and defects.  It doesn't have to be AA but that sure is a fucking simple place to find such people.

Well put :)

Beautifully explained. One of the better summaries of what's really going on with alcoholics that I've read...&gt;this alcoholism shit is not about fucking alcohol..Yep. But try explaining that to anyone.

Reading this is truly a spiritual experience for me...Not only that it's a heart-felt articulate expression of your own.
Great job; thank you for sharing. It's not just the alcoholics that have problems from our pride/ego. Keep up the good work!..I've never been a believer in god but I know AA (my whole life I've lived with alcoholics in and out of AA). It's true that it works if you work it.
Why would this piss off a lot of people?  ..Thanks it was a pleasure to read!
It definitely has to be your highest priority to work.
