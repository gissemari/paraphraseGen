Hey everyone!  We've all made it halfway through the week!  For anyone new this is the halfway point check-in where we see how everyone is doing and offer our support.  What's going with you SD?..**Triumph**:  My daughter started middle school this year and because of my own experiences with that time in my life I was very very nervous.  But she really seems to love it and right now my family life is going really well.  I know tweens' moods can turn on a dime but at least we're starting out well...**Struggle**:  My job is a disaster.  It's kind of sinking my moods below the Mendoza line.  I suppose the silver lining is that I've been listening to a lot of black metal lately which does give a funny image of an accountant doing accountant-y things while blasting black metal in his headphones...**General:**  I really need a goal for the near term.  My life moods and sobriety always do better when I'm working towards something.  I wouldn't be as down on my job if I had something else to focus on either.  My last very many goals have all been fitness related so I'm going to try and come up with something different this time...That's what I've got SD.  How's it going with you today?
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph:  For the first time in a decade or more I was able to give due  diligence to my veggie garden this year and am now reaping the rewards...Yummy stuff!..Struggle:  My cigarette habit has increased since I quit drinking. Dr. prescribed something to help me quit and being me...I did a little research and found out that what he prescribed does not play well with other scripts that I am currently taking. Sometimes I wonder about Dr's...General:  Life is GOOD &amp; I am GOOD too. Zig Ziglar said..."The more you recognize and express gratitude for the things you have the more things you will have to express gratitude for." I am truly grateful for my sober life today! Big attitude change from 6 months ago. Sort of cliche..."It does get better!"  I will NOT drink with you today!  Peace
Hello all. I'm new to commenting here but have been lurking and just wanted to thank so many of you who have recommended *This Naked Mind*. ..I downloaded the audiobook from the library and Annie Grace has been inspiring me to marvel at the incredible wonders of the human body and mind. Something about the science of it all is giving me such a different approach to drinking--and such a radical altering of my perception of my own human organism. I got sick recently and rather than bemoaning my symptoms I was just astonished at how my immune system launched its attack and took care of me. I can't imagine drowning my white blood cells and leukocytes in alcohol--those suckers are too freaking awesome to harm like that! ..Anyway I'm not sure of the protocol here but following your post OP I'd say my triumph lately has been really loving my own anatomical system as crazy as that sounds. A struggle has been ignoring the constant siren song of booze everywhere (including a sidewalk sign in front of a bar nearby that says BOOZE HERE in neon chalk...). And generally I'm just extremely grateful that this sub exists and that I found my way to a book that's changing my life from the inside out...Thanks so much SD!
Triumph:. I have really built a solid meditation habit and it has become automatic in the mornings... Really seems to help...Struggle: I have a lot of good habits and intentions but just feel too tired in the evenings to accomplish many of them... I suspect I am just not getting enough quality sleep (I get up at 5 so it's hard to do).  Plus my chronically crappy left ankle continues to hinder my running...I am getting closer and closer to resigning myself to biking and abandoning running which would be really really sad for me. ..General: I need to work in my social life in sobriety... My work and family life have stabilized in my almost 2 years of sobriety but socializing has been a distant afterthought... Need to work on that. 
Its day 7 for me. .Ive been rehashing the last 20 years of embarassments and feeling all this pain inside. But someone once told me here that you should live the rest of your life in a way that if someone heard an embarassing story from your past they wouldnt believe it..Other than thay i think im being impatient but i havent been feeling great. Very very tired headaches stomach aches etc.... granted its still better than a hangover.
T:  I worked clearing land all day yesterday.  I came home shuffling my feet and aching head to toe.  A few drinks would've helped that pain.  You know what else does?  A hot shower.  It made a huge difference!..S:  My work gas gotten extremely slow.  That has me worried...G:  I love my gf more than life.  I want to propose this fall. She's amazing and such a positive force in my life.  After a year each day still is better than the last.  
Triumph: determined to start working out and have 2 days in a row. ..Struggle: still slightly obsessed with getting the hell out of this job. Then stressing on having the perfect answers to interviewers about the imperfect situations I've been in. ..General: finally getting a whole day off even though it's all full of plans. IWNDWYT
Triumph: I reaffirmed my commitment to stop my alcohol abuse..Struggle: I am still not feeling physically or mentally right from last weekend's bender. Yet work has been horrendous the last few weeks so of course a drink sounds nice..General: I'm getting married soon and I look forward to doing so with no alcohol in my system!
Triumph: I saw the 160s this week for the first time since high school.  Feels pretty good...Struggle: The longer I spend sober - and now that I actually feel my moods instead of drowning them - the more I suspect I fall somewhere on the bipolar spectrum.  My mother and brother have it so it wouldn't be unexpected.  It's just that 90% of time it all feels manageable so I don't know if it's worth pursuing any treatment...General: I'm doing slightly better with social anxiety lately but I still need to work on that.
**Triumph**: Had the first meeting for my creative project and it went well. I've been productive at work and cutting down on caffeine... sort of...**Struggle**: My living situation is still absolute shit and I'm stuck in this lease for the next 6mo minimum. It's really threatening to flip my fuck it switch. I'm having a really bad couple of days of depression around it and my food issues are back with a vengeance...**General:** just feeling pretty down in the dumps and useless at the moment I need to work on maintaining my routine and anxiety not controlling my life.
Howdy everyone! Pretty new here but digging it so far...Triumph: still kicking along fine. Sleep is better. Mind is better...Struggle: It's been 15 days and I've hit that mental point where I think I'm ok and can go back and have a beer or two and not go crazy. Which won't be true. ..General: life is alright. My brother from overseas is in town so it's been great to catch up. Been picking up the guitar again lately too! 
**Triumph**: Not craving alcohol. I have been exercising every day and feeling good...**Struggle**: It is easy to reconcile maintaining sobriety for a finite amount of time today tomorrow next week  I mentally struggle to accept the infinite of sobriety forever. ..**General**: I am ready for whatever happens next.
**Triumph**: I'm in a good routine of running/training regularly. It's an easy way for me to relax and it makes me feel better...&amp;#x200B;..**Struggle**: I'm having a hard time at my job recently. I'm happy with the actual job but I don't feel comfortable with one of me colleagues. Most of the time I don't feel good enough for the job and she doesn't make it any easier...&amp;#x200B;..**General**: Even though I have some bad days at work I'm happy and sober. I've moved to a new city recently and don't know anyone. I've started in an AA group to get to know new people so far I'm happy with this.
**T:**  I used to be on food stamps...**S:**  Dogs are giving me hell.  I got puppy and it's brought fleas with it.  And it gave my senior dog fleas.  Senior dog has a really thick long coat.  So her and fleas is a really bad combination.  I've had continuous health problems with senior dog for almost a year now and...  plus she's been keeping me up all night because she's been scratching at her fleas...**G:** My ex still manages to inflict punishment into my life and I've gotta distance myself from her BS.  If anything to protect my daughter. .
Triumph:  I had a weird one over the weekend a friend and I were talking and this is what she said "I'm glad you stopped drinking you used to drink the grossest stuff."  apparently not everyone appreciates a scotch and orange soda like I used to. ..Struggle:  my teeth are wikkity wikkity whack yo.  I'm going to need dentures sooner rather than later. ..General: The wife and I happenend to be awake at the buttcrack of dawn last weekend.  We went out and drove around and I took pictures.  Got some fun ones.  [This one] (https://scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/31a794a33f216f8b7364cc945d7670e4/5C1B02CA/t51.2885-15/e35/41662994_1910739869229532_5914599303344866623_n.jpg) is my favorite of the bunch so far.  
**bold**Triumph: Killed yesterday at work. Realized first thing in the morning yesterday that I was going to be swamped with catching up work due to my excessive drinking the prior week. Instead of freaking out and shutting down I handled it moment by moment like a boss. I finally have a little faith that I can pull myself up by my boot straps so to speak...**bold**Struggle: My father's birthday is this Saturday and he's have a big wine themed party. Normally I would skip out on anything this early in sobriety but it's his 60th and there will be a lot of people I know and enjoy there. So it will definitely be a struggle to stay sober BUT I'm actually more confident than I would be at most any other party just because I know I can socialize sober with a lot of those people and the food will be amazing so I'm gonna focus on that! Plus my USC trojans start there game an hour and a half after the party so good excuse to not stay too long!..**bold**General: Fasting for Yom kippur today! Not jewish or religious really but have been fasting on and off lately. Decided to hop on along with our Jewish friends and join them for this physical and maybe spiritual cleanse. Might give my liver some breathing room too!..Much love SD!!
T: I am about ten weeks sober..S: I cant help yo come back to the point where I have to accept my alcohol problem and remember why I am doing this all over again even though working in the steps and putting in an effort in the work in rehab. I keep falling back to "It wasnt that bad" or "I cant fucking do this bullshit". .G: Currently on sick leave tight on money bf is broke. Starting work soon in three weeks and Im scared shitless but also calm in a way that it will give me a legit reason to drink again if it is too much stress. Doing my best at rehab and attending AA-meetings. 
**Triumph:** I'm actually feeling rested after my vacation. It's such a relief!..**Struggle:** All day yesterday I was dreading coming in to work and once I reviewed my inbox and checked in with my boss it confirmed a realization I had this weekend: I need to pick up my job search pronto...**General:** At my friend's wedding this weekend I found myself questioning a lot of things in my life - my career my relationship my health my attitude and through all of it I wasn't able to stay present at the wedding or reception which made me even more frustrated. It was still good to be there but I need to work much harder on being in-the-moment and grateful for what I have in my life.
**Triumph:** I'm keeping up at work.  It's been a rough transition: longer work hours and a lot of deadlines but I'm managing...**Struggle:**  I don't know if it's hormones or stress or a combo but I've been having bad days more often and it's 80% in my head but totally intense.  ..**General:** Bats can live 30 years. 
Triumph: My triumph and my struggle this week are interrelated. I've been feeling more competant confident and comfortable in my own skin lately. This week there have been huge ups and downs where I feel very comfortable with myself but only after rather difficult periods of anxiousness and insecurity. Yesterday between work I went to the gym brought a bunch of great food home and danced alone in my apartment to Post Malone in my headphones. ..Struggle: For two days before that I had pretty slow burning anxiety. I'm 3 weeks into a new job. I'm getting to do new things at the job that I know I can do. However learning and practice are different and difficult. Especially if you're a slow moving and cautious person...General: I mean.. 80 days in and even though I've had a longer sober streak I know I'm the furthest away from alcohol I've ever been.
**Struggle:** Last night I had a terrible night of sleep--insomnia and crazy intense dreams when I did finally sleep. I woke up with tired jaw muscles. My most recent dental check-up found fractured teeth. I'm clenching my jaws so tight I'm breaking teeth. ..**Triumph:** Things are going well sobriety family health and work-wise. It's great to have moments to reflect on that and savor the good times. I know the depression will be back some day as will the good times.
I can't believe I'm almost at a month. I knew that I was capable but kept thinking that something would set me back also. For me staying productive with work and personal hobbies helps about half the time and the other half I have to actively rationalize why I made the decision to stop and how that is different from before... I rationalized my way into drinking every time in the past and gave in because I believe my feelings were involved. Most of the time I drank simply because I felt  good' and didn't consider what I would eventually feel. It was like a selective kind of bargaining where I emphasized the good (being drunk) and ignored the bad (all the harm it does to my life body and spirit). That's some powerful denial going on and poor rationalizing. In my defense though I was self medicating to deal with personal issues. 
**Triumph**: Almost a week re-dedicated to full-on sobriety after a summer of a "mostly sober" attitude (i.e. binge drinking once a month for the first few months then weekly by August then every other day by September). The mostly sober attitude came about after 8 months of sobriety followed by a nasty break-up. Glad to be committed to full sobriety again. Goal is to beat my previous sober time of 15 months. That would be December of 2019. I'm looking forward to it (and the continued lifetime of clear-headedness!)...**Struggle**: Met a woman online. She lives in Oregon and I'm in Arizona. We haven't met yet in person and I'm struggling with that. I very much want a relationship where my person is here with me. I miss touch. And then I worry about what it will be like when we do meet in person (two more weeks!). Things like: what if she smells funny?! Two months of long-distance flirting for something that wouldn't actually work? But then what if it does work and I find myself in a long-distance relationship for reals?! I don't worry about cheating (it's not like there's a prevalence of queer women; hence the long-distance thing) but I do worry about missing her. So I just don't know what to think. ..**General**: I started grad school this fall and my worry that everyone would want to go out drinking hasn't materialized. Well the worry did; the actual going-out part hasn't. And I'm making new friends. So yay!
Triumph: I applied for yet another job. I am going volunteering later. ..Struggle: Ugh tbh almost everything has felt like a struggle today. I was feeling upbeat then this huge wave of sadness hit me and I felt utterly depleted. I just sat and cried for an hour feeling worthless. I am not dealing very well with being unemployed and still can't escape the guilt of upsetting my friend who I still haven't talked with. I just feel like a wreck and I'm having a hard time coping...General: I started doing online yoga. That's a positive.
Last night was a good evening. We had a few friends over to watch sports. Someone asked me twice if I wanted a drink and my SO volunteered the info that I hadn't drank in a month. Nobody commented on it everyone was pretty tipsy by then or focused on the TV. But I felt a little put on the spot. I don't want my sobriety to be a "thing" I just want to not be drinking tonight and if people figure out that it's more than a night off that's fine...I think I'm going to thank my SO for having my back and let him know I'm more comfortable just not drinking and letting the conversation about sobriety come up organically if it needs to for now. "no thanks" is enough for me for now. ..I didn't have any strong cravings or FOMO last night (I did have work today as my excuse so). I went to bed earlyish. I heard everyone getting louder and a couple people getting snippy with each other. Glad it wasn't me...IWNDWYT. 
Triumph: .Bought a bench/squat rack for my garage and have started lifting which feels awesome! ..Struggle:.I don't know how to talk to my wife about my drinking problem because she grew up around alcoholics way further down the  spectrum  than I am. She actually laughed at me when I said I thought I was having withdrawals. ..General:.I've found a couple new Tech-Death bands that I love: Archspire and Beyond Creation. 
**Struggle**:  I hurt my knee was unable to train properly for a long solo backpack trip in a rugged and remote part of Colorado.  I had been planning this trip for almost a year and had really been looking forward to it but it was looking more and more like I was going to have to ditch the whole plan but.....**Triumph**:  ... I decided to go anyway and just apply the *one day at a time* principle and it worked out really well.  I started off slowly and stayed within a gimping range of the car but extended that range as the days went one and the knee felt stronger.  By the 5th day I was able to double the distance from 7 miles up to 15 miles (with a heavy colder weather gear laden pack).  Looking back I could have easily just given up on the idea but if I've learned anything in the sober journey it's that perseverance and patience pay off in the end...**General**:  My ears are still ringing from blasting my car stereo for days as I drove there and back. 
Triumph: I havent drank. ..Struggle: I've lost confidence. I used to be the guy that could do anything. I've changed jobs moved across the county multiple times. Travelled abroad. Ive never failed. Before I stopped drinking I failed. Lost a job and friends. I cant seem to get passed that. I also can't seem to see myself as good enough. Not even really for others but to myself. ..Overall: I do like being sober. I do miss drinking. I know I just need more time. So I'll drink my soda water and keep on collecting days one day at a time...IWNDWYT 
T: Yesterday I hit double-digit days of sobriety and my wife agreed to continue marriage counseling...S: I'm hitting AA meetings hard to drive to put as much distance between me and booze but I have two little boys at home and the meetings are keeping me out at night when I'd rather be tucking them into bed...G: I'd really like to slow down and listen to people and think about what they are saying.  So many people are sharing so much love and advice and support with me if I would just slow down and soak it in rather than blurt out my own excited thoughts about my new found sobriety.  I have a lot to learn and while I learn when I open my mouth I learn more when I open my ears my mind and my heart.
Struggle: I got a bs ticket today. I dont have the money to pay it..Struggle 2: Ive been slacking off on my spanish studies and have a test tomorrow. ..Truimph: Ive been fucking killing it on guitar lately and been having a lot of fun learning flamenco...General: i just found out who Ben Shapiro is yesterday and it blows my mind to hear grown adults use internet lingo like "snow flake" and "social justice warrior" unironically from 4chan 10 years ago. I remember when we started using those words on 4chan to troll people on /b/ and now they have intergrated into the mainstream right wing lingo. Its sad. 
**Triumph:**  I'm actually relatively on top of having the house together for my parents' impending arrival.  Usually I'm running around with my head cut off as I have a very triggering and critical mother whose raising of me was very similar to ACOA families.  But I've been taking action well in advance and not letting my brain rule me.  Yay growth!..**Struggle:**  GF was having ALL the feelings about my parents coming and made me do her emotional work for her.  Ugh.  She eventually apologized and agreed to support me.  But the amount of stress and processing this involved...blergh...**General:**  Whenever people come to visit I use it as a kick in the pants to not only clean the house but buy things I've been meaning to that will make the house feel nicer and do things like trim and re-pot the house plants.  It also reinforces a positive response instead of anxiety around visits.  Feeling pretty proud of myself!
**Struggle:** Another reset but not the big doozy of withdraw/screwing something up. Just tired or resetting. Working really hard at keeping goals and staying positive but my whole living situation is a HUGE challenge when it comes to attitude/aura/mood/overall vibe - it is ssooooo negative and irritable and just bad....**Triumph:** I am actively working on bettering life. I have 2 gigs coming up that should give me some money to get things in better order financially. I have a 3 month event where I can get a reliable income - so yay more money. I am in the process of getting a job/career back at old place who said they wanted me back and pay more. I have been looking into schools and if this job thing pans out they can help with the cost. Also I am super excited in selling my car and getting another bike. I really really dislike cars and bikes just make me happy to be alive and I need that in life - plus save money :) (ughhh everything is money - I am really not that person but i am at an age that I have to start accepting that it is in deed necessary lol)..**General:** I love living a busy life. I love having a planner/calendar and filling that bitch up - some people think its crazy because it literally is all work. Example: Tues 25 - Microsoft convention 6-1430 PT 1700-2200 Weds 26 Microsoft convention 6-1430  etc etc.... its all work no fun..... sometimes I will throw a "fun" thing in there but if I am not working I am prob just sitting on my ass even though I say I will go do something social - I generally don't. Sooooo ya why not work (its kinda social) instead of sit on my couch and eat too many carbs and possibly drink? :P...[High Five](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg)
Triumph - Completed a ton of projects at work that have been left undone for many years. I've also maintained a consistent yoga and meditation practice over the past few weeks. I credit the energy from not drinking...Struggle - It seems that energy didn't last as I was hoping it would and I've found myself behind on even simple tasks this week. I've hit the snooze button a few of times instead of waking up to do yoga and meditate. I was hoping the super effective full of energy me was my new normal but now I'm thinking maybe not. I know my chemistry is still balancing out and that these things go in cycles for everyone but I was really proud of what I accomplished and I hoped it was going to be my new baseline...General - Life is generally pretty awesome! My business is doing well. I have a wonderful family and a beautiful smart two and a half year old son I just adore and who adores me. It's a little early to telling people but SD we're expecting our second next spring! ..Just writing this comment has helped me reflect and I think it's important to remember that ups and downs will come and go but focus on the big picture and be thankful for all the good things in one's life...Thank you SD! ..IWNDWYT
**Triumph:** Got my kayak on the water today for the first time in a long time.  So good for my soul.  Much needed beauty appointment tomorrow. ..**Struggle:** I need to find a new dentist.  It is taking much more time that it needs to. ..**General:**I am finally almost over the three-week virus I have made two important decisions and I am feeling so grateful that I have no desire to drink.  
Back to day 3 for me. I've been on this rollercoaster too long and i'm ready to get back on track. I remember how good 70 days felt and I just know deep down I can do it again!
Triumph: I'm physically stronger than I ever have been in my life. I've been working out regularly and actually (gasp) enjoying it! It's a marvel what my body can do if I help it rather than hurt it. ..  .Struggle: Not sleeping well. Over-using technology and other distractions...&amp;#x200B;..General: Feeling pretty good but also a bit self-absorbed right now. Creating a structure for myself to support healthy behaviors feels a little like pushing others away. 
**Triumph:** 20 pull-ups in a row today! Nothing to do with drinking but I haven't done that in a while. Doing pull-ups is miraculously easier when you're about 5 lbs lighter!!..**Struggle:** Working and studying too hard and not getting enough sleep. Not finishing projects on time. Not spending much time with my kids. Not paying enough attention to my wife. This too shall pass I keep saying. And it will...**General:** My first month is going by relatively easy so I feel like I'm just coasting. I don't care about having beer or wine but I don't feel determined to beat them either. I am just existing while not drinking at the same time. Boring but I guess that's good.
Triumph: I got out of bed and went to work even though I really didn't want to and I didn't drink. On days like today that is the most that I can ask for. ..Struggle: I'm struggling with depression and also struggling with my identity. I'm pretty sure that I'm a lesbian and that I drank for all of those years to cover it up and it feels pretty bad to know that I've been lying to everyone including myself. ..General: Most of my hobbies and my life depend on nicer weather so the seasonal depression is already starting to hit. Today I ordered a sun lamp on Amazon and I'm starting to consider getting back into fishkeeping -- a hobby that I gave up in high school and have been yearning to get back into for a long time. I finally have the spare cash to do it now that I'm not spending $12k a year on booze. :)
T: I smile more..S: My house is a sloppy mess from being constantly intoxicated in the past and not giving a shit. It's a lot to clear out/organize. Kinda like my head..G: I spend way too much time on this sub thus ingnoring the sloppy mess in my house. 
Triumph: 10 days sober and feelijg wonderful and clean. My general mood and patience are high and I have loved the feeling of real strong quality sleep with no assistance or ensuing hangover. ..Struggle: My job pays a good amount but I deal with a ton of bureaucratic bullshit and catty nonsense that sometimes make it seem not worth it. I have good days where I still enjoy the work and then I have days where I want to blow my head off if I hear another fake person say meaningless fake shit. ..General: Im good! My day really begins when I get home and see my 6 month old daughter smile at me like I am the best dad in the world. Anyways I remind myself that my happiness in my job is not as important as providing a good life for my wife and child. But most importantly.....I Will Not Drink With You Today!!!
Triumph: I had lunch with my sponsor today. Before she came to meet with me she met up with some ladies that go to a lot of our meetings. She told me that they just adore me and have seen a huge change in me since I started the program a month ago. That I seem genuinely happy and willing to throw myself fully into making this work. ...Struggle: I'm sick today and I've been fighting it for a week. I finally broke down and went to the doctor and it looks like I'll just have to wait it out a few more days to see if it clears up. If not then I'll get antibiotics to help. It's sure better than being sick from drinking too much though! ...General: I'm just happy with life right now. I love going out to see my new friends. I love spending the evenings with my husband. I enjoy work.  My sleep is mostly good. My hands no longer shake. I can drive to work in the early mornings without worrying that I'm not fully sober. I can make surprise drives to wherever I want to go in the evenings because I'm not too far gone. I love this sober life even if it's not always easy. 
Palindrome
\*Triumph\*: Finally mailed my friend his birthday present this morning. His birthday was September 9th eek. ..\*Struggle\*: Ugh I meant to go to bed a while ago. My boyfriend's on a business trip and I'm home alone which always kinda unmoors me. I was finishing up some homework for grad school and I saw a classmate left a negative comment on a discussion post I wrote. He didn't disagree with me. The comment was just along the lines of "this post sucks" but written in more grad school-appropriate language. Which true it wasn't my greatest post ever it was a little short but usually discussion post replies are supposed focus more on content than on form. So that's what I'm annoyed by at the moment. ..\*General\*: I should really go to bed. 
**Triumph:** I got a bill from the dentist yesterday at  1900/$2200. Due to a long term diagnosis 80% of this was refunded (thank God for the Scandinavian welfare model). Also the dentist cut another 10% because he felt sorry for me (lol) leaving me with a bill of about  200/$250. I can t believe my luck (although it took cancer and four broken molars to get there lol)..**Struggle:** Do you know the feeling when say you spend weeks preparing a social happening for kids and families and you invite people buy stuff spend lots of time making arrangements make sure everyone invited and affected knows about it at least a month in advance pour lots of love and thought into it and then three days before it all goes down learn that some other really standup guys *in the very same community* are doing the exact same thing on the same time and day just on a bigger scale and budget? And that even talking face to face about it they simply didn t tell you because bless their souls why wouldn t I just you know know? Yeah that...**General:** I love autumn. I love winter and summer and spring too. And summer. Heck I love everything including you reading this. Seriously! And the guys mentioned above they re really neat and sweet they re just... human. So very very human.
