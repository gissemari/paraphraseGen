Drinking whiskey in my pick up before I go inside my home so my fianc  wouldn't know.  Until she smelled me   . It sounds so stupid but that's what I thought I was going to miss when I got sober. How fucking sad right?? I'll take another 24 with all of you and I hope all those are struggling fine peace. God bless.

Here's my list of alcohol fomo:..1. Same as you drinking in the car before coming home;.2. Having drinks at lunch;.3. Drinking while having a shower;.4. Getting wasted and watching horror films because when I'm wasted I crave the extreme fear (I hate horror movies);.5. Drinking while cooking;.6. Chugging wine to numb the chest anxiety as I call it after what I perceive as a bad day at work;.7. Sneaking alcohol into my Diet Coke in the toilet stall of a  movie theatre (can't watch movies sober. Not allowed apparently). ..Yes I thought I would miss these things. Literally normal daily life that happens required alcohol or i couldn't do it. ...Alas. I am sober. IWNDWYT 
If I boiled it all down to one thing I am missing out on the perpetual hope that drinking will somehow recreate a social life that I had nearly 20 years ago.
