It's not a contest. But I know some of you struggled more than me today and I hope you are doing ok. ..I hope for a day when alcohol is less prevalent. ..I'm a bit worried about Thanksgiving. But basically I'm always worried when I have to not drink in front of a different group of people (this time family). I know I'll do great even if it's uncomfortable at times. You will too. ..IWNDWYT

Don't think too much about it. Just say you are not drinking have a glass of lemonade with you and enjoy. One day at the time. Whish you all the best!
&gt;hope for a day when alcohol is less prevalent..That day is coming. It becomes less and less of "what it's about". It's wonderful.
