I remember how many tries it was before I quit for good. My thing was drinking wine every night- often a bottle. Never liquor or beer just wine. And fiiiiiinally I just really decided to "go 30 days". That was a little difficult. But once things were in swing it was incredibly easy! I just made the decision I didn't *want* to drink anymore. I wasn't someone who missed it and was white knuckling it or identifying as someone struggling. Once I made the decision the rest just came. ..And I've lost so much weight! Down to 134 as of this morning from a height of 170. It feels amazing! Life isn't perfect or easy. My sister is a raging alcoholic who drinks all the live long day. My Dad is getting old. I'm extremely worried about my career. But one thing I know for a fact is that drinking won't make any of this better and in fact makes everything worse...If you're on day one times 50 that's ok keep trying. Make it 24 hours then 36 then 48. Hours turn into days and before you know it you're going WHY DIDNT I DO THIS SOONER!..So seriously stick with it. It's SOOOOOOOOOO worth it. Plus you'll lose weight and get hot what better motivator than that? ;)

Congratulations on one year of Freedom!!!    !  Hi5s!  It's a wonderful thing an amazing turn of events even if at this point the events are mostly inner changes.. I feel like at the second year it's a new phase where those spill out into manifesting the outer changes as well- a natural progression!
