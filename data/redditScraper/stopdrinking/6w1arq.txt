Binged drank 2-3 days for the past week and it doesn't help that I have an interview next week with pretty bad social anxiety. I think I can accept that I am no longer in control of my life. Seriously what the fuck do I even do?

Coming back here was a good step.  How about go to an AA meeting?  There is time to get it together for the interview.  That is a big incentive and motivator I would think.  I won't drink with you today.
I got professional help by getting an therapist who specialized in addiction. I was also honest with my doctor because I needed help to safely withdraw from alcohol. My desperation led to being willing to do anything to get well. Rehab and AA gave me the tools I needed to build a sober happy life. 
I find that I am out of control after the first drink. It's like letting my guard down and giving the demons the wheel.  Before that I can control the certain aspects of my life. The hard part is accepting the things I can't. 
Welcome back! You have plenty of time. You're going to be a confident winner walking into that interview with a week of sobriety under your belt...If you can beat alcohol even for one day you can get and demolish any job. I know you can because you're doing one of the hardest things known to mankind. No job is out of your reach...You take life one day at a time and make the most of that day today.
