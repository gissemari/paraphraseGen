Hello SD..Checking in to mark one year since I stopped drinking. ..Like many of us I can confidently say that quitting drinking is one of the best choices I have ever made for myself. It has provided a foundation from which to approach my life with intention and mindfulness in a way that aligns with my values. ..I have to shout out to exercise as the thing which has been most helpful in my journey. As I've detailed in other posts I started working out daily the same day I quit drinking. Coupled with sobriety it has completely transformed my mental health improved my self-esteem and provided all sorts of physical and spiritual benefits...I am truly grateful for this community. You lovely folks have been a constant source of wisdom and inspiration. Thank you everyone. ..To those of you who are struggling just remember you're not alone. Sobriety is yours if you want it and it's so fucking worth it...IWNDWYT.
