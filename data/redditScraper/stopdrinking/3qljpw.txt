i am finally ready to return to my own life. the world is a terrifying and beautiful place and i know i have the strength to make good use of my time here as a sober me. i'm tired of being tired i'm sick of feeling sick and i'm going to let my light shine. this will be a return to my greatest loves - my art my family my friends and advocacy for my community. my ancestors are with me even those who also struggled with alcoholism. the glamour of wine is dead. i am alive and for the first time in many years wide awake. in solidarity...

Welcome wordwarriorDDO.  What is your plan?

Welcome /u/wordwarriorDDO to /r/stopdrinking -- At this [link is the Baby Steps post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is nothing more than conventional wisdom about how to start stopping.  ..I love your post because you are quite right about what we miss when we live in service to our addiction to alcohol and its consequences.  There is almost nothing I consider more valuable personal to me--than my time.  Recovery returned that asset to my control.
Fantastic. This is what I hated most about using. It made me disappear. Now at least I am me for better or for worse or for worse.
