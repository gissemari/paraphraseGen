Hey everyone it's Wednesday that means the week's half over! How's it been going? Share your triumphs struggles or just general chat!..Triumph: Last week I finished 8 months of outpatient treatment.  I'm proud of how much I changed over those months...Struggle: Been feeling depressed lately.  Part of it is because of legal requirements with Visas it's very likely I've lost the opportunity to work at two of my dream jobs in the US.  The US doesn't recognize my education and experience as enough for a work Visa...General chat: It's August and there's fog out my window say whaaa...Have a great 24 hours folks!
----------immediate responses--------

Today is a good day.       .They are all good days it seems.     .In any case they are a lot better than the drunken daze.

Triumph: after almost 4 years of wanting it and 5 interviews I GOT MY DREAM JOB!!!! I saw my desk yesterday &amp; officially start today. I am so thankful for this chance seriously. And being sober is the only reason I had a chance getting it...Struggle: my brain does not want to let me enjoy it. It goes "good you got the job. Now you need to get the guy." Asdfghjkl:;!? Thanks brain. (The guy is a friend I've realized I like as more than a friend.) ..General Chat: August? Fog? Weird. It has looked like rain here and been cooler than the 100 degrees I expected so that's exciting!.. Also? How's school going for all of us that just got back?

**Triumph**: While this isn't good in the sense that I don't wish stress on my wife it's good in that it shows personal progress... She's really stressed with things outside of my control (her job ...).  This is a triumph for me for a few reasons:  the stress is not because of me (this time) I see that it's due to things outside of my control I see that there isn't anything beyond the things I'm already doing that can help her and even though she's stressed we are doing well and it's OK.  It's hard for me to get to that point.  I either feel guilty or feel like I have to fix it.  And in this case neither of those things apply...**Struggle**: None..**General Chat**: Playing in a tennis tournament this weekend.  I'm so excited about it.  Yay me!..NoMoreBeersPlease: I hope things work out for you man.  I'm sure it's frustrating to know that so many people get to the US and work who don't go through proper procedure and you're being given the run-around.  Think good thoughts.
Triumph: Powerlifting training is going super well. Yesterday I had a flawless set of deadlifts and I am so happy about it!!! (Yes I am a bro)...Struggle: Financial concerns. I know take a deep breath do the next right thing. Finances really get me going...General chat: I've started getting into home improvement so I made a comment to my fiance about painting the kitchen. He got so excited I was showing interest we're suddenly go balls out on it this week. The weirdest things keep that guy occupied :P
Hello sobernauts!..Triumph: still living the dream.  Sober.  Healthy.  Loved...Struggle: my daughter seems to be going through some kind of prepuberty hormone thing.  She's crying over the smallest things.  Even my most innocuous comments are taken as hurtful.  It's hard to remember that she needs me to lean in instead of walk away when she gets like this. ..General chat: I want to go see the new Simon Pegg movie. I hear it's great.
Triumph - I am 9 months sober have 20 consecutive days binge free and am back on track with my marathon training plan after my back injury (12 miles last weekend 14 this weekend!)..Struggle - I am still harboring about 15 pounds of extra weight which is a blow to my self esteem and making me run slower. :/..General chat - when will this summer weather end?! I'm sick of it being over 90. Or even 80. Also first college football game Friday night woo!
**Triumph**:  Realized the other day that I'm excited about the things I have to do even the mundane stuff. I feel more... positive I guess? More connected to my responsibilities and joys...**Struggle**: Family members are starting to notice that I'm not drinking at all. I'm just not ready to say anything to them about what's going on with me and I hate thinking that I have to. I've only discussed with my husband what I am dealing with and I don't really want to go beyond that..
Bored at work but at least I'm not tired. Actually I am but not exhausted as I normally would be. Day 2 for me
Struggle:  (I started by typing Triumph and couldn't think of a damn thing I feel triumphant about this morning so let's start with Struggle.)  EMPLOYMENT.  When I found sobriety I left the high-paying high pressure job so I could focus on getting clean.  I figured it wouldn't be difficult to find a job with my experience and education but NOOOooooOOO it's not been like that.  When I did my 4th step one of the Institutions on my grudge list was WORK.  Next week I go back to work at a job I was doing before I finished college (teaching paraprofessional) at about the same pay as I was making in 2003.  I am grateful for the work and the structure and I know it's going to be a fun year because I was placed at an elementary school.  That's not the point the point is I still have student loans to pay... and I still need health benefits... and I need a break from resenting "the system."  I have had 6 job interviews in 8 months time all of them were "Sorry you were on the short list and your interviews were great but we went with someone else."  So... for the summer I gave up looking so that I might create a little mental distance from that heartbreak.  This morning I came here to this sub because I have a resume and cover letter to do and I am putting off the inevitable.  ..TL;DR: It is difficult to take the emotion out of work/employment/earning...Triumph: "Well I don't have to drink over it."..General Chat:  My sister from California is in town... going to manage the "adult child" stuff with a sense of humor today.
Triumph - 4 months sober which is a record for me since I started drinking years ago.  Also I'm getting married on Sunday.  And I still have some awesome news that I can't discuss yet.  But it's awesome...Struggle - My 'surprise bachelor party' is on Friday being put on by the best man of course.  The issue is that he doesn't know that I'm not drinking for good.  As far as he knows I'm not drinking for weight loss reasons or whatever other reasons.  Unfortunately he's one of those people that refuses to understand that I'm not drinking because I can't control myself when I drink.  Either way he's scheduled us to go to a place called Barcadia for three hours and I'm dreading it for both 'I'm not drinking' reasons and just my general 'going out is my own personal hell' feelings.  But oh well.  I'll persevere.  I'll be relaxed with my fiancee by the end of the night and I'll unwind.  It's just going to be a miserable few hours out on the town...General chat - Hot damn 4 days until the wedding.  16 months of being engaged and it's finally here.  I'm looking forward to it.
**Triumphs**: One month hell yeah! I'm amazed and proud at how well that's gone so far. My new place is also coming along nicely without overexerting myself...**Struggles**: Now that my ex is back from her holidays I'm trying to get a normal friendship going again but she's *very* standoffish. I (subconsciously) had hoped that she would maybe be open to start seeing me in a different light after I'd not drunk for 4 weeks but to no avail yet :( This also leads to thinking along the lines of "If she won't even see me then what's the point in taking good care of myself?" which takes quite a lot effort to turn around. I know it takes time but I'd like to see *some* progress.....I also still don't sleep more than 5 and a half hours at night but thankfully I don't have any trouble falling asleep. But going to bed before 12 and waking up before 6 is weird and a bit tiring...**General**: Later tonight I'm going to take a test to judge my level of Spanish to see which course I should take to get beyond my very basic level (and taking a class is a nice way to meet new people too). I'm planning to go to holiday to Spain after I've finished that (somewhere in November)...EDIT: Apparently I managed to retain enough Spanish in 8 years of non-use (and degrading my brain with booze) to be able to start at the post-beginner level (DELE level A2.1) next Tuesday!
**Triumph:** Yesterday I was happier than I have been in many years.  I didn't think I would ever feel so good without drugs. ..**Struggle:** I'm struggling with my head as usual it's telling me a lot of bullshit...I'm glad to be sober today I think about drinking or using almost daily but most days I have a strong desire to stay sober which I'm grateful for.
I caved.  I drank today.  I feel like shit.  
Nearly 2 weeks sober!.Struggling with some depression regarding what to do with my life I have no steady job and no idea where I want to go from here. I feel desperate to find a girl to be with but I don't feel together enough to handle a relationship right now. .No fog around here it's sunny as hell. 
I'm doing shite. I had to give up drinking due to chronic pancreatitis (not caused by alcohol but still had to give it up). I didn't realise how dependant I was on alcohol until I couldn't drink it any more. I didn't drink every day but when I drank I drank.My whole social life revolved around alcohol stressed? Few bottles of wine will sort that out. I was slowly getting confident in social situations without alcohol i was able to enjoy things without a drink on the side. I was six months alcohol free then at the weekend had one pint of 6.7% cider on a night out. Im now in agony and constantly on the verge of vomiting all from one single pint of cider. I really really miss alcohol still which is fucked up. I would give everything right now for a bottle of smirnoff this weekend but instead I'm off work sick on a bazillion tablets trying to avoid having to go to hospital. 
Triumph: [Report from a doctor's visit yesterday.](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1l7jky/nsv_numbers_dont_lie/) Given that I'm in part recovering from years of neglect of my health from my drinking days I'm especially happy at this. Bonus: my doctor signed off on a clean bill of health for my petition to have my driving privileges restored...Struggle: Stressing out a bit about that hearing for my petition at the state capitol next week. Part of our state's process is that we have to appear before a hearing board and include letters from people that know me both through AA and in my life generally and some of those are still pending. I have to remember that no matter what happens with the hearing and the subsequent ruling my recovery and sobriety come first...General Chat: Congrats on finishing the outpatient treatment. I got through mine a few months ago and even though it was mostly something that I had to do for the above petition and also for probation I did get some worth out of it. Sorry to hear about the visa thing.
Triumph: Today is a solid 2 weeks booze-free (and all other substances too for that matter)..Struggle: Family sucks (well dad's side) work sucks a lot money is suddenly very tight. May sound strange but I'm really concerned with the political climate right now. US going into Syria NSA etc...General: despite the struggles above I'm feeling generally positive. Which actually has me thinking 'wtf' a little bit as I have never really been a positive person.
Triumph: Stayed sober last night...Struggle: Brother went off-the-grid was acting very odd last night and things finally ended up with him in the psych ward. Very difficult emotional night. Sneaked some cigs but that's all (see above).
HUMP DAY!..Today was my first day of my junior year of college... pretty exciting stuff. One of my teachers was going over the syllabus and reminded the class to "be good no drinking no smoking..." I recounted the times I've gone to class with wine or beer in a coffee cup and it made me grateful that those days are behind me. I'm here to learn to better my life... not to slump over half-assedly in the corner of the room laughing too loud at peoples' jokes and barely absorbing any knowledge...I can't wait for the 1 month mark! That'll be the longest I've gone in 3 years!..Happy hump-day ya'll.
Triumph: didn't drink last night explained to friends my new situation and went home..Struggle: saw friends boredom  before bed
Triumph: I am officially one month sober today. I never thought I woulake it. ..Struggle: I'm on a week and a half vacation. Which honestly is pretty cool but all the time off is allowing my brain to start wondering back to thoughts of drinking. So I'm just tryin to find all kinds of ways to keep busy. .
Hi!  NoMoreBeers good luck with your visa etc.  I know from seeing some non-US citizens go through similar stuff at my work that the "process" is.... pretty nonsensical.  Ugh.  ..Triumph: not drinking.  I've had good actual phone conversations with my family lately.  Met tons of new freshmen students this week which helps me stay optimistic...Struggles:  newfound mental clarity helps me realize how much time I've been spending on stuff that I don't enjoy or find fulfilling.  Like drinking but also some work stuff etc that I've been doing more out of inertia than anything else.  This is a good realization but will require a bit of confrontation with some people.  People who are sort of friends.  And I don't like confrontation (my solution has usually been you guessed it....DRINK!).  I dunno.  I have to walk a line between advocating for myself and not being a bitch.  I'm SOOOOO TIRED from work and poor sleep that this seems very difficult right now...General: 1. My phone wanted me to type "condo station" instead of "confrontation." 2. Thanks for being such an awesome community.
Triumph: almost done with school. yay!..Struggle: depression is a bitch. I need to reset my badge but forgot the new date on it. Sometimes it's easier if I don't obsess over dates too much. ..General chat: early mornings can kiss my ass I want my sleep! :)
Late posting was napping all evening yesterday...Triumph: Shooting pool sober feels normal again.  Won the 8-ball tournament this past Monday at the bar.  Urge to drink has not been a problem and people are supportive of my sobriety...Struggle:  Feeling depressed more often.  Thinking about all the asshole shit I did when I was a drunk and knowing that it will take work to rebuild some relationships...General chat:  La Croix is my new favorite beverage.  No sugar or artificial sweeteners!
