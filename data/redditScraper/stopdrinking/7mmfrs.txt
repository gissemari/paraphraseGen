Last night I dreamed about relapsing. I was going to an swimmingpool with an wine bar with my brother and an friend and decided an few hours before going that i was going to drink an glass of wine. So before going i thought "fuck it lets's drink an few beers before going because if I relapse I could drink more than one drink". I could taste the beer and even taste how cold it was. After one beer I woke up sweating and came to the conclusion it was an dream. But it seemed extremely real. ..Today I feel like i relapsed (feel really bad) but I didn't pretty weird. But I now know how relapse feels and that I don't want to relapse because it feels terrible. ..A few days ago I had an weed dream where I felt really bad and guilty (I also haven't smoke pot for 3 weeks but I was an weekend smoker). ..

That happens! It's really [common](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=title%3Adreams&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)..It can be disconcerting but don't let it worry you... ..There was an interesting post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2dit1m/what_do_drinking_dreams_mean/) about the possible meaning of drinking dreams in case it helps put your mind at rest.....I won't drink with you today keep up the good work!..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Drunk dreams are very common in early sobriety. They will decrease in frequency with time. In the meantime relish the relief of waking up knowing that you didn't drink after all!
I had a drinking dream last night! It was the first time in a while and it really threw me this morning. As you say it felt very real. And very crappy. Probably my brain processing all of the wine and beer my relatives are consuming around me this holiday!
