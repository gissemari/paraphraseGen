I'm 3 months sober went to ER 2 times and experienced severe acute alcohol withdrawals. Last month I had 3 dreams where I found myself drinking laughing and enjoying myself while I can. Figuring out how much I should drink and when I should stop before my body will depend on alcohol again. ..When I wake every time I feel lousy like I actually relapsed. I'd like to say thank you to my dreams because they reminded me what EXACTLY will happen if I touch a bottle again and I will suffer going through everything again. Constantly thinking and getting anxiety about thinking about my health and wanting to enjoy a buzz. ..It's not worth it. ..I'd like to say don't give up your hope. ..I would not be drinking with you all today. :) ..

Congrats on 3 months!..Have you seen the [entry in the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index#wiki_does_anyone_else_have_dreams_about_drinking.3F) about drinking dreams? There's some useful reading there.....I had a drinking dream last night out of the blue... first one for ages!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Go to an AA meeting and talk about drunk dreams...You'll start an avalanche...Go to normal people and try to start a conversation about a dream...[crickets]..Good luck
I still get drinking dreams occasionally.  
Good man.. and me a sober Sunday coming up.
