10 days sober! And had a drinking nightmare .....I know it's because I'm afraid of relapsing. Since April this year i couldn't stay sober more than 10 days ... (February &amp; March I had 60 days!)..This time I've made myself more accountable : I've told my parents (I'm 39 years old so that was hard to do ...). I check in to reddit twice a day. Listen to 2 podcasts of Recovery Elevator a day. I take a small dose of antabuse every day. I've finally admitted to myself that I'm an alcoholic (instead of "I have a problem with drinking...") and I can never drink again...So here goes ... IWNDWYT!

That's inspirational for a 37 yo dude. Last thing I told my parents was that I was going to kill myself. It was *very* brave of you to make that commitment. Deliver. You can do it!
Well done you're doing great. I told my parents recently that I had a problem and was going teetotal it was really hard to do so I feel you! IWNDWYT
Those dreams suck but it's so relieving once you wake up and realize you stayed sober. Keep up the great work! IWNDWYT
