I called my MD but he was out of the office and I think his nurse confused naltrexone with suboxone because she said he wasn't licensed to administer it. ..Yesterday I went to a doctor that's an addiction specialist and she told me that you don't have to be licensed to provide it. She wanted me to go through her obviously and she wrote me 30 days of naltrexone to get me through until I get the shot but obviously she wants me to stop taking my ADHD med... I take adderall for ADHD I've been taking it for 10 years and I can survive without it but I do MUCH better with it. I don't want to stop taking it unless I NEED to... she also wants me to attend a group therapy through her office every week weekly drug tests and to do a full blood panel (which I just had done in July when I went to rehab). ..I just had a short relapse and wanted to get back on vivatrol but with my work schedule and my schedule with my sponsor and my other appointments I don't have time to add another weekly appointment and I don't want to stop my normal prescribed med that I don't abuse. I can't afford another full panel of blood tests either...I scheduled an appointment with my MD next week to talk about the naltrexone/vivatrol face to face and hopefully there was just a miscommunication and he can provide my script from now on.....Sorry for rambling I'm just annoyed because the appointment was a big waste of time other than getting my first 30 day script and the office was super unprofessional and I don't want to go back. Ugh.

I'm afraid I don't have much experience pertinent to your situation but I hope that the future goes more smoothly for you :)..Out of interest why did your doctor want you to stop taking Adderall if you're on naltrexone? Adderall is an amphetamine and all the resources I've found state no interaction with naltrexone..[1](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-10077-001) [2](https://bnf.nice.org.uk/drug/naltrexone-hydrochloride.html#interactions) [3](https://www.drugs.com/drug-interactions/adderall-with-naltrexone-190-1645-1684-0.html)
IME a lot of MD's have zero experience with this drug and aren't comfortable with it.  My GP wasn't I had to go to a shady "pain specialist" to get it.  ..&amp;#x200B;..And really?  Avoid AA because of the possibility of 13th step?  I mean that's partially why we prefer same-gender sponsors and have single-gender meetings available.  Does her "program" charge for meetings?  
My MD who is not an addiction specialist prescribed me naltrexone and vivatrol
