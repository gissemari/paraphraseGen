I don't know why I'm struggling so much lately. I want a drink so fucking bad right now. I'm not going to I'm about to stuff my face and hit the hay as soon as I get home. However lately it's been difficult and I don't know why. I'm hitting up meetings working the steps trying to step out of my shell and help other alcoholics (even though I'm not finished with the steps) but fuck I'm craving hard and have been for the last week. It could be that this is day 10 with no day off from work. Anyway what suggestions or words of advice do you folks have?

Most likely stress. I've found that stress is my biggest trigger and I think it is for most alkies 
You've got this! 
Someone at SD told me about HALT - hungry angry lonely tired - being the common triggers for drinking. Can you try to watch for them? I feel your frustration but keep going with your sobriety. As much as you'd like to drink you're in touch with that part of your brain which says  I will not'. Know that you are loved you matter you owe it to yourself to stay sober. Stay strong. IWNDWYT.
All you have to do is not drink today. 
Hey buddy I had a hard time around 3 months too and I see many people do. It will get better! You're doing real work now even if progress may seem slow solidifying your sobriety. I will not drink with you today! 
It's not uncommon to get a fixation at the milestones. Congrats on your 100 I'm sorry I missed you big day...IWNDWYT
