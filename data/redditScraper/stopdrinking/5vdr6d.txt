I usually throw out the number five years as the time in which I was in a state of chronic relapse. I realized today that's a bit of an underestimate. It was actually 9 years ago (last December) that I first seriously thought I needed to quit and first toyed with an AA meeting imagining never drinking again etc. Granted I changed my mind and really thought moderation would be the way for me etc. But I guess I just noticed that my quitting process has been far more extensive than I realized. ..Anyways. I love all the various time markers and noticed I have another big one - 100 days - coming up shortly. And I realized again that I really have not had a single "craving" and definitely not a single "urge." Mind you over the past near decade I had hundreds of these. But this time is clearly just final a line in the sand. ..Anyone else out there who has suffered and suffered through all the "practice" bouts of abstinence and now still in the first year of what truly deeply seems like "the last time?" God I wish I had gotten here sooner.

For me "the last time" is only a day away from becoming "the next time"... not trying to poop on your parade but I had over 2.5 years sober had no cravings swore up &amp; down I wouldn't drink again- and then I drank... and that relapse lasted about 1 year... cravings urges or whatnot I just maintain vigilance and guard my sobriety like a precious object...
