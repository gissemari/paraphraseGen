Today was good went back to my sports club told a mate I'd quit drinking on medical advice. He looked at me like I was insane for not stopping sooner.  I was shithouse today during training haha! Made me realise how deluded I've been with how drinking affects my health  fitness and training.  Not drinking's becoming exciting!  So much free time it's unreal. Slowly moving back out into the world  feels better than I've felt in a decade. Will post weekly then monthly or whenever I'm struggling from now on.

Good work man glad to hear things are going well.  I've tried to train the last two years whilst on and off drinking moderately to too much and it's not pleasant.  Am looking forward to seeing how the fitness improves in the coming months!.
Right on man! That's the spirit!
congrats keep at it. things are better with you aren't all cloudy.
Congrats! The free time IS unreal isn't it? I've read two books and increased my fitness a LOT in the past 2 weeks. I used to be able to barely do 2 laps around the track now I can do a half hour straight. I'm glad you are doing so well it truly is exciting.
&gt; He looked at me like I was insane for not stopping sooner...It's funny how we're the last one to know...Keep it up!
:) yay 
Hungover training is... possible. But for me it was more like doing penance. Struggling through the pain because I'd been bad and deserved the pain. My idea of fun.
