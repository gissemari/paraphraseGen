I honestly take that as a good sign. My brain is starting to process drinking is something of the past again showing me what regrets it will entail. I won't drink today. Thanks everyone on here for the support and love. I found a temporary sponsor I'm sure so that's awesome or at least someone who can keep me accountable and check up on me. I'm ready to work the steps or at least be brutally honest with myself starting at the beginning of each day with meditation. I'm staying at a sober house for 30 days if I don't relapse by that time I'm going to move back into my actual place but go stay there if I feel an urge. I'm scared as I should be but luckily I have these plans in place and I'm already sticking to them. Oh and I'm also going to AA everyday...I hit a young people's meeting last night but I was sadly still the youngest person in the room and didn't feel connected to anyone. I got a lot from the meeting but didn't get a need to talk to someone sadly. Also everyone smokes there I felt sick just from the nicotine. I've never done a single hard drug don't smoke weed or cigarettes. Sometimes I can't connect with these people I feel because they are so messed up still from other drugs...I'm going to keep trying to find a meeting I feel at home with. No excuses. Onward and upwards.

Yeah I'm personally convinced that drinking dreams are positive.  In fact I used to dismiss them all together as random firing of neurons but so many people talked about them I [ended up exchanging emails with dream researchers on the subject.  At this link you can read what they told me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2dit1m/what_do_drinking_dreams_mean/)
I was surprised when I found out this was a thing. I thought it was kind of strange but a couple days ago I had a dream where I found a half drunk bottle of vodka and panicked thinking I had slipped up. Weird...Only one I've had but sure I will have more coming.
