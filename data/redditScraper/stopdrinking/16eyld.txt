http://imgur.com/FmmrM..Thread here:.http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/16dwph/is_there_anything_like_aa_that_is_not_completely/..Is that what we do here?  I do appreciate the pm though.  That way the mods can't see it...Let's go into what I believe here.  I believe you are a sick individual.  I believe you suffer from impulse control and probably have juvenile tendencies.  I believe this happens without the use of alcohol.  I believe it has followed you your whole life.  I think you switched your addiction to a delusion in an attempt to fix yourself.  I don't think you even believe what you say but you push it so hard because you are fearful you are going to relapse because you are weak.  Quitting alcohol after the first week isn't that hard if you put your mind to it...I think your bitter and angry.  You stopped drinking and you are better off but you still hurt.  It isn't your drinking that is the problem it is you.  ..I think you are involved so much in AA because it makes yourself feel better.  It is your new drug.  I think you lashed at out me because deep deep down you have had a miserable life and just sitting there while some guy on the internet trashes the very thing you exist for in a logical method causes you pain.  You fight back like the religious do with religion...You sent someone an pm who is/was trying to better them-self in a hurtful and spiteful way.  How would your AA group like to know how you treated someone trying to quit and what would they think of you?  I don't go for the whole passive aggressive thing.  I don't appreciate it but I do get why you had so much problem quitting and with alcohol.  It isn't the alcohol that is the problem.  It is you.  ..It is the hypocrisy of AA and the people like you in that makes me sick.  I would rather hang out with people in a bar than your ilk. ..

That's very inappropriate behavior and I'm glad you called it out t0ssaway1.  
&gt;Is that what we do here? I do appreciate the pm though. That way the mods can't see it...That is most definitely not what we do here.  That PM is completely inappropriate. And it's so far over the line it's not even a close call. ..Had that PM been posted as a comment a mod would have either responded and reminded nicebass1 that belittling others is inappropriate behavior or the comment would have been deleted &amp; followed up with via PM...I'm sorry that you received that PM as a result of posting here on /r/stopdrinking.  That's not something that typically happens and nicebass1 was completely out of line in sending it.  His actions are not representative of 99.9% of the other people who post here...Thank you for bringing this to our attention...**Edit:  I want to be very clear about something.**  To everyone here: the number after your name doesn't make a damned bit of difference.  Whether you have 9000 days or 9 days or even if you have 0 days you are more than welcome to contribute to /r/stopdrinking. You don't have to worry about being mocked or belittled for sharing your thoughts feelings or opinions.  You should never feel like your voice isn't "worth as much" as someone else's.  It's not a hierarchy.   If you ever receive a nasty PM as a result of something you write here let the mods know about it.
Is this in response to just the one person or to AA as a whole? Cuz...ya know...one person does not an organization make. I've met lots of nice people in the program. I've also met several assholes. It's bound to happen. Assholes are everywhere. I used to be one of them (Hell I still can be from time to time)...That said I don't think there's any conceivable reason for someone to be a condescending dick like that. You're working on improving yourself and your life and that's applaudable. I know I said it already in the IRC but congrats again on reaching double digit days. Some people don't seem to remember how big of a deal that can be.
No one's perfect and everyone works their own recovery. Tough love who knows...Apart from that that's their shit. You keep doing what you're doing.
I've always hated all the cliches in recovery and AA/NA however they are usually sound ideas that someone in early recovery like me can roll around in their head until they sink in. Because I can get pretty pissed at some people and meetings I try to remember that its "principles before personalities" and I do believe in "keeping my side of the street clean" but the most important one of all for me to remember is that "AA is not exactly a hotbed of mental health". No doubt. I accept that.
If I wouldn't go somewhere because some of the people there are assholes well... I wouldn't go anywhere.
I expect that behavior on the great majority of reddit but not here.  When I stumbled on reddit 10 days ago and enjoying my 6mo mark I decided to create an account and post the achievement to r/self.  Here was one of the wonderful folks that decided to congratulate me there:..http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/15rl1l/6_months_sober_today_first_nye_in_15_years/c7peu43..Luckily someone directed me here and I've been visiting daily.  I find everyone here to be honest and supportive in a way I find refreshing.  No bullshit no preaching just good folks waiting to listen and throw a few good words your way.  I too am agnostic or whatever you choose to call it but I genuinely have an appreciation for whatever inspires you to quit the drink.  If you believe in the guy with the beard that's cool. If you believe in nothing I'm fine with that too.  Welcome and congrats on your 10 days.  
WTF. So sorry that you were on the receiving end of that.
I don't speak on behalf of the community but I would like to apologize. I come here to find help and to help other people in the same situation I am in. As offtherocks has stated that kind of behaviour has no place here and does not represent the vast majority of the community. 
Good for you for hitting ten days. A.A. Isn't for everyone and everyone does not need A.A. It is important for those of us who are trying to live a sober life to be as open and as honest as possible with ourselves if we are going to reach the full understanding of our problems. We are flawed-but in a glorious way. We are selfish- because we care. We have to take care of our selves before we can take care of others. That is why i subscribed to this sub. 99% of the time posts have been very helpful and everyone- no matter the treatment option- has been open minded and respectful. If i can interject personally here: A.A. Is not for me either.  My mother and step father both went really far into A.A. and were even counselors. Most visits with mom as a youngling involved going to A.A. meetings with her. I attended Alateen for a bit as well but it never jelled. When i first became sober last August i came upon a copy of the A.A. big book and there really are some great lessons and stories to help you along. If i were you ( i know this is getting into your original post) i'd puck up the book. Not to entice you into going to meetings but to use as a reference as well as all of the other books on quitting drinking that are out there. Some may see what i wrote here as a 'duh why didn't you live by their example' but i had to go on my own journey as do you. How better to do this than with a great sub like this with such honest caring people? And BTW: i am an athiest too but if i needed a high power it would either be my toddler daughter or David Lynch. :).
Not worth drinking over. Hats off to you.  All's fair in sobriety short of maiming puppies...
The difference between hypocrites in church and hypocrites in AA is that in AA you can smell the hypocrites...Sorry that you got slammed hope you continue to post and let us know how you're doing...I say this *as an AA member.*  AA does NOT have a lock on recovery.  MORE people (about 60%) get sober without AA than with it.  So go or not as it suits you just never say never.  Of the 60% who get sober without AA it's split between church psychotherapy self-help medical treatment etc.  so AA only has a plurality...And yes we have sanctimonious blowhards in our AA meetings here in my hometown.  They don't get kicked out for that.  We don't kick anybody out...Congrats on your sobriety I wish you well.  Please continue to post we need all points of view in this subreddit.
Whoa.  "Wish you luck" is an attack?  Offensive? .Was there sarcasism in those 3 words or was it an expression of hope?.I have no way to know but the reaction here seems as though it had been a personal attack.  I did not read it that way...Full disclosure: I am in AA it saved my life. I freely admit it is not for everyone. I do suggest it to be tried and not as the only path...If it does not work for you and yes there are assholes and hypocrites in AA that is ok with me.  Thing is it is a resource that potentially can help the folks who frequent this page and slamming it would seem to limit their options.  ..I have on occasion sent a pm some have answered some have not. Sometimes a discussion off line can be more personal more productive..If this is offensive to anyone please delete it. Believe it or not my perspective does occasionally help others that is why I am here. And it is not about longevity it is about recovery - I know people with 90 days who are in better shape than others with 30 years...Finally about hanging out with people in a bar - these are the same the very same people I have found in AA - they tend to be less angry more coherent and a lot less apt to vomit on your shoes.
keep coming back. You are always welcome in our rooms and you are always welcome to your opinion. I struggled with the whole "higher power" thing as well. Almost all of us have. ..But I do ask of you to please read the basic text of our group. There is a whole chapter devoted to atheists and agnostics! Howeversome groups can get cocky and arrogant and they can forget their whole purpose for needing meetings in the first place...You **ARE** entitled to believe in whatever you choose too believe in. A non-judgmental look at the 12 steps will show you this. ..Nothing you say sounds new to me it weird. Hell I've probably said it all once before too. I am a proud member of AA because it is the only method I've found for long term sobriety. It's this the only way to stay sober? NO! Not at all...If you think you can stay sober of your own free will then go for it! I know I couldn't and that's why I keep coming back
I'm not entirely certain I see the "attack" here. ..I think I've had some similar things said to me here and I may have repeated them. The simple fact is that a lot of people come in here after four days and say "omg my life is perfect now that I'm quit thank you." ..We all know the start reality: this takes work and fortitude. People ride high early on but few stay with it. Is it possible that the mod was saying something along the lines of "don't get cocky kid"? Perhaps he or she was trying to hint to the user that it's easy to talk the talk but not as easy to walk the catwalk? I don't necessarily see any malice here. Maybe there was but I'd prefer not to assume. ..And OP: Settle down. Just because John Lennon was a dick doesn't mean George Harrison is one too.  
This is going to be an unpopular opinion but its bugging me and I have to say it. ..OP this is a gross overreaction. ..Yes it was a rude comment and nicebass1 should not have sent you that pm. It was out of line. ..However so is this post. It is a very very personal and very very public attack over a stupid remark. A post such as this that attacks not only another member of the sd community on such a personal level but also the method of recovery of a fair number of members of this community is not conducive to recovery nor does it contribute to atmosphere of help support and fellowship in this sub. Two wrongs do not make a right... A simple message to the mods would have sufficed.
