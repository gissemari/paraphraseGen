Some background: I recently got out of jail for 6 months for something I did while drunk. I'd quit off and on for the year before that with regular relapses; this (including my incarceration) is the longest period of sobriety in my adult life. (I'm 35.)..I had the dream last night where I got drunk and fucked everything up and went back to jail. I've never been so glad to wake up. I feel _lighter_ this morning just because I apparently spent the night imagining different ways in which I fucked up...I haven't gotten pleasure from drinking for a long time so there's no point at which I imagine a good time turning bad. It's just bad from beginning to end. Some people don't believe me that I get no pleasure from it but I don't. I've burnt out whatever pleasure there might be had from it by a lifetime of heavy heavy drinking. It may be a form of PTSD but one I'm grateful for...The only time I have an urge to drink now is when I'm having a really bad stressful day. In fact that's how I got arrested: I was really angry and did it on purpose because I wanted the catharsis of a blackout. I got it...Anyway I'm glad to be awake and sober today. Cigarettes will have to go at some point. I hate the idea that I'm killing myself slowly with them I just haven't been able to stop. When I got out of jail the urge for a cigarette which I had hardly thought about for 6 months became so strong my face itched.

Glad you posted this.  I've had drunk/alcoholic behavior dreams 2 nights in a row now.  Not sure wtf is going on but last night's was a real mindfuck.  I am having a hard time making like Taylor Swift and shaking it off this morning to be honest...I also have to quit smoking at some point.  I really started smoking more once I quit drinking.  I smoke about 4-8 a day depending on what I have going on that day...Glad you posted - we can commiserate together friend!  :)
Yep I am in the same boat with the damn cigarettes..I am determined to at least switch to vapor.
