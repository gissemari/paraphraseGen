1.5 years ago I went 69 days without drinking. It was my longest stretch of sobriety ever but I fell into the mind trap of "proving" that I can control my drinking and that I was most likely able to moderate. I couldn't and I ended up slowly spiraling back into daily drinking. The anxiety slowly crept back in the exhaustion of recovering from "unwinding" the night before the feeling of complete worthlessness and like my life was headed no where meaningful. Back to hating myself on a level that's hard to comprehend with a sober mind. Back to wishing I would just die. ...It took 1.5 years (and countless relapse's) to get back to 69 days. As everyone mentions it's not easy. There's a reason why I drank and now I have to face those things. I still have anxiety I still wake up exhausted and I'm still overwhelmed at figuring out where I want my life to go. ... But I don't hate myself anymore and I don't want to die. .

Congratulations! So many times I have been tempted to drink after completing a stretch of sober days for example 30 days or 60 days or 90 days and I have always felt bad when I relapse. It takes many relapses to understand that being sober for good is the best option.
Nice.
