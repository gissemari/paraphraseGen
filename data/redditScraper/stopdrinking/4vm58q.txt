hey there...you and I aren't drinking today. Bring it on Monday!  
I an with you!
Just realized same thing. It just doesn't work anymore. Not even for a night. 
For some of us writing out how it happened helps prevent it happening again. Also the cautionary tales here help us all. 
I feel exactly the same. Hate it with the fire of a thousand suns. Let's both try to remember this when it starts looking all rosy again.
How's it going today? 
If you have a drinking problem then you are a MUCH MUCH better person without alcohol. Never forget all the humiliation and shame you felt. How much better do you feel physically and mentally? Alcohol progressively destroys every organ in your body and especially the brain. It directly leads to depression anxiety and a host of other mental health issues in otherwise mentally healthy individuals. ..Remember how hangovers feel?!?  They're the fucking worst! Remember how bad it messed up your sleep and made your body feel like shit?..If you're like me you were a bad friend colleague boyfriend and family member because of alcohol-this doesn't make you a bad person at all just someone with a very very common issue. ..You're on the right path. Hopefully this will serve as a good reminder.
