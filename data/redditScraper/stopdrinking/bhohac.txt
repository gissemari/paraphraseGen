So... third day without alcohol. I have struggled for a few years now sometimes being able to quit for a couple weeks but no longer. I went on a pretty serious bender recently... a lot of vodka and hard alcohol every day for about two weeks. My first day without it was horrifying. I had really bad tremors I couldn't eat my body wanted nothing to do with liquid unless it was vodka I could barely walk without falling over shaking. I should have been in the ER... Second day I was able to eat most of the shaking was gone I was able to drink liquids. I've been emotional but it wasn't bad I felt hopeful and ok. ..I'm on my third day and it's terrifying. I'm flipping out on people. I can't be around people anyway for a while because of this... I am shaking with rage and absolutely cannot concentrate and don't feel like myself. I feel very very bad and I see nothing good in myself that I used to. I feel no good  chemicals  in my brain. I feel like my levels are just completely shot and I have no idea when I'm going to be ok again. I'm dizzy eating and drinking isn't helping my mood at all. My vision is a bit distorted still... like a lot of my focus is just gone. I am not finding any kind of happiness in anything I'm doing. Alcohol helped me get that rush of dopamine or whatever that I became so addicted to... I feel terrible that people care about me and I don't think people should waste their time on me regardless of them saying I'm a wonderful person. I just don't see or feel it anymore. I feel outside of myself and like... violent and just ready to die. I would not hurt someone but it's hard not to hurt myself. I already am diagnosed with PTSD depression anxiety on moderate-high levels. ..I have no idea how I'm going to get through this and I can't afford any of the help I need... and I definitely cannot get a job right now because I'm barely functional on so many levels. I'm barely getting by wasting days not finding a new job while my mom works her ass off to afford us living... it makes me feel really terrible on top of no income and these really bad withdrawals and mental issues...I honestly just feel like whatever rollercoaster I was on finally decided to just derail and crash to the ground.

I do NOT want to ever go through the withdrawls again! You have went through 3 of the worse days! Why not follow thru and then you can see the good benefits? Don't give up on yourself. You can do this! IWNDWYT
The first 10 days sucked hard for me. The third day was by far the worst. ..Embrace the suck. You are making a great choice but it's not easy at first. ..Get through this..It got easier for me around day 10. ..I never want to go through it again. I'm so happy I chose to stop
