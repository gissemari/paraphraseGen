Apologies for the wall of text...just arrived at my parents' a couple of days ago and already struggling big time but thanks to meetings I've gone to my new vivitrol shot and reaching out to others including here I know I'll be able to get through this **without drinking.** Plus despite all of this I feel AMAZING because my mind is clear my body is hydrated and energetic and **I'm happier and more at peace than I have ever been in my adult life.**..For those of you that haven't read my posts before my mom has been fighting stage iv renal cell carcinoma metastasies in her vertebra since 2010. She's truly amazing and has responded pretty well to every treatment out there but the cumulative pain and toll over the years is evident. Her illness was always my biggest trigger when I was drinking...I couldn't control the situation couldn't control the cancer *couldn't* control her pain...but I *could* control numbing my depression away...Last Christmas I was not present. I got drunk both on Christmas Eve and Christmas (on my own in the guest room of my parents' house and was passed out blaming a "migraine" while the rest of my family and my ex-boyfriend went to church and ate dinner). That will not be a problem this year!..You see..my mom is a shell of her former self and it's incredibly difficult at times and it used to be an enormous trigger for me. Last night just going to the grocery store caused so much pain that she could barely walk and I heard her struggling to even put groceries away (I tried to help her but she snapped saying she can do it just fine). Her eyes are sunken she is frail and her emotions are all over the place which I do not blame her for at all but sometimes..it still hurts...She's been crying a lot saying sorry for this Christmas not being the same. I bought a small tree and decorated it as a gift to my parents so at least it smells like Christmas a bit and they appreciated it but my mom is still understandably down about *this* Christmas..but what she doesn't realize/remember is that we haven't had a Christmas like we used to for at least five years. To me none of that stuff matters. What matters is she's alive I'm sober and we're together as a family but I still get why she's sad and I'm hoping a few surprises I have up my sleeve will raise her spirits a bit!..Her white blood cell numbers are really down from her chemo so she's incredibly weak and with her pain (not only does she have several holes in her vertebra from the tumors she also has a shattered sacrum from a recent fall) and exhaustion she lashes out at those close to her often. ..Here's a pretty tame example: Wednesday I asked her for pillows for sleep as there were only throw pillows on the guest bed...she started crying and got super emotional asking me why I had to point out she didn't make the home perfect for Christmas and said I should know where they are because of how long I lived at that house. I calmly stated that I was not trying to make her feel less-than I simply forgot where the pillows were thanked her went back to my room and texted a fellow sober friend that I can share anything with and vice-versa to vent. I cried a little which may seem over-dramatic but the way she responded...that was not my mom at all. It was like I was talking to her evil twin and it's hard to witness. She can go 0 to 60 over something seemingly innocent or of little importance and last year I definitely drank over the frequent outbursts instead of dealing with the emotions they brought up for me. This year I am using all the tools in my toolbox: talking with people going to meetings journaling feeling emotions instead of holding them in playing the tape forward taking my dog (who I brought with me thank God) for frequent walks when I need a break etc. ..Last night I found myself isolating so I didn't have to interact with my mom because it was hard to see her  misery first hand. While I wasn't drinking I was definitely exhibiting the behavior I used to exhibit when I would drink my feelings away. Instead of continuing to isolate I notified my dad I had to go to a meeting and asked for a ride (no license for a while) and immediately felt better after and was able to spend time with them  the remainder of the night instead of isolating and internalizing my emotions...Most importantly I am not going to regret my behavior this Christmas as per past Christmases. I am going to be present for the holiday and for my family and I am just SO happy to be sober y'all..I'm getting choked up as I write this last part because I am in such a better place than last year. It's been a rough year between the breakup jail lost license financial woes work concerns my mom's cancer etc. but so far (minus one night's slip) I'm getting through it without drinking isolating or hurting others in the process and **I am just so God damned happy about that.**..Thanks for listening to me sobernauts I will not drink with you today...**TLDR; My mom is in incredible pain from her cancer and is lashing out quite a bit but I am not drinking over it. I am here (mentally and physically) for my family this Christmas and am allowing myself to feel emotions instead of drinking them away.**..P.S. As for getting my first vivitrol shot WOW. I mean I'm having a little bit of nausea but they said that should go away by the second shot. This is incredible...zero cravings even when I sat next to a woman on the plane that was drinking non stop! Came at the best possible time as this trip is testing my mind body and soul this far and instead of being distracted by cravings I want to be right where I am in the moment making memories and being kind to myself and others...**EDIT :** I write for a living so I always find myself re-reading and tweaking the language in my Reddit posts (especially when I make them on mobile like this one as they're usually all over the place which drives me crazy). I'll stop now...I just can't resist!
