Really struggling to make it to AA meetings. I feel like with work working out and getting some rest and relaxation I just can't find time. Another reason is because I'm so early in sobriety I feel like I'm just going to meetings just for the hell of it. ..I really want a sponsor to keep me accountable and walk me through the steps so I can enjoy what others enjoy. What's the best way to find a sponsor? I'm sure it's going to meetings as much as possible. ..My motivation to stay sober is as high as can be but finding the time to go to meetings and sacrificing relaxation is very tough because stress is my main trigger to drink...I know I'm just making excuses right now but when I have a purpose at each meeting and working on goals and steps it motivates me more and more.

Glad you posted. I'm not sure that what you need is a sponsor just yet. The role of a sponsor is to share their experience as you work through the steps with their help. Anything too far beyond that isn't really in anyone's best interest. It's definitely not in your best interest to have someone chasing you around to keep up your meetings and step work. There's a line that's read in almost every meeting that goes  If you want what we have and are willing to go to any length to get it then you are ready to take certain steps.  If that's not where you're at yet that's fine; that's what meetings are great for. Willingness will always be a component of working AA's program no matter if you got a month or twenty years. In my opinion you're right where you need to be. You'll get to the next step when you get there. That's the only way my program has progressed in spite of my intentions.
I am having a similar problem getting to meetings every day but I have made a deal with myself to go 3 times a week more if possible. I found a woman with whom I had an instant connection and we just had our first "sponsor/sponsee" meeting tonight. I think you'll know when you find the right person.
