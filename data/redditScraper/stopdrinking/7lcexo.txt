I'm approaching one year of sobriety and generally feeling great. However I've had these nagging dreams which have really left me feeling down...The first few dreams involved me standing in a liquor store browsing a vast beer selection trying to find that high ABV craft beer that will taste great and get me drunk. The dreams did not progress beyond this at first...Within the past week I have had two dreams in which I consume a drink in a social setting instantly feeling elated and being alarmingly ok with what I have done. I quickly lose all interest in sobriety and have a noticeable desire to get drunk quickly. I wake up feeling as though I have relapsed despite knowing it was only a dream...At times I find it very difficult to shake the negative feelings these dreams have left me with. It is frightening...Has anyone else had similar experiences?..IWNDWYT

From reading lots of posts here this seems super common. You can search old posts I know there's a lot of them where people discuss this...It's awful waking up with that feeling of regret and for me it's sometimes accompanied by a hungover feeling too. Usually I'm able to shake it off pretty quick once I realize that I did not in fact drink the last night.
I've had two dreams in which I drink and then feel extremely disappointed in myself. In one I regretted my slip immediately. In the second I thought  this is great  at first which was then followed by regret. 
It's part of the deal...They get further apart in my experience.    ...Be good to you today
