Hey everyone! I recently achieved a year alcohol free (I smoked some pot early on but I've given that up too). Frankly I don't have a whole lot to say about the past year other than I'm so so so glad to be sober. I had a relapse a couple of Summers ago and it wiped out nearly everything I had achieved during my sobriety. It wasn't easy but I've gotten a lot back plus a little extra. I also want to let you know that my life isn't perfect but I know I can always improve as long as I'm sober. If I can stay sober there's practically nothing I can't do... ..Here's the real reason I'm posting: I want to offer my support and encouragement to everyone reading this. Sobriety isn't easy but it's worth it. Always keep trying never ever give up. .. ..For the inquiring minds out there... Counseling is what worked for me and I've lost somewhere around 40lbs. I wish everyone the best and I love you..Edit: formatting

I've been doing counseling as well it's definitely been a huge help. I tried drinking again a few months back and it went about as well as I expected. I'm just tired of it waking up sober is so much better. Well beside the whole having to feel emotions thing but that's why I have the therapist. Thank you for sharing and I will not drink with you today!
