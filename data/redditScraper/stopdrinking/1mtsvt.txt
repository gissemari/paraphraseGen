It may sound very strange that I didn't really get it for a while. I'm not here to continue to relapse and be re-forgiven by the world and unable to forgive myself. i'm not here to lose total hope in myself in a series of visits to the hospital. This whole community can actually work for me even when I really just don't want it to work and my cravings are driving me into an ugly spin of thoughts. ..I thought about drinking this week seriously for the first time since my last drink. I thought about it so much that I thought it through to realizing that I just wouldn't know how to stop and how stopping would be the most frustrating annoying thing to have to go through again whatever my physical state. I just wouldn't want to. So no matter how frustrated I was to be sober a couple of days ago I stayed sober. I got to an AA meeting and told the room from the heart what I was feeling. A woman accross the room started crying and said she'd lost 11 people this year at her work (a detox) and she locked eyes with me and simply said "you're awesome." and for some reason I felt a huge angst lifted from me. I was invited to help out on a 12th step call and we met someone in need of some help. Things started to come full circle for me. I was explaining how this whole program helps me live sober the community and in sharing the concept of having an ability to grow through the hard times by resisting a drink It just started to all make sense to me. Helping others is some real powerful shit. ..So I had to finally live through a wave of cravings realizing that living sober is what it's really about. I don't want to test it anymore. Sometimes I miss that feeling of things being new and the momentum of the first few weeks the huge enthusiasm. These days i'll just have to observe as things evolve and I come to terms with real life. The reality is that life changes so much so beautifully for the better. A year ago I wasn't even planning on quitting drinking and my outlook was impossible. Now all of those frustratingly impossible things are happening things like growing up. I've just paid first and last months rent on a (cheap) starting apartment here in town just to learn how to be independent from my mom. I feel like i'm growing up situationally. That was never going to happen back then only one year ago life was a completely different place to live. I probably wouldn't believe it. ..I look forward to introducing this newcomer to some new friends and some places to go in the recovery world.

I cried at this. I can't wait to be in your shoes man may god bless you in every way or whomever the fuck you pray to. You are an inspiration and I would like you to know you made my hope/future brighter
I'm so happy for you man. This is a great post and it sounds like you've made some huge progress! It's great that you got your own place. Moving out should make things better for you. ..I find that reinforcement you're getting through AA service through trying to help people in the subreddit. It's like that old adage: if you really want to learn something teach it. ..Keep it up! 
You did **exactly** what the program says you should do...**Get your ass to a meeting share get involved and help another drunk.**..And it worked!   Does for me too.  ..Congrats on the life changes too.  You are in for a a ride. A good one..
That is awesome. 
You made my day: when in a danger zone all we need to do is reach out and help someone. I think you are spot on and wish this will come back to me as clearly whenever I am in such a position. Thanks for sharing.
That's about the post I have read here in a good while!  Thanks for posting this.  I have done a few twelve step calls in my time and they really do help me put my problems in perspective.  You deserve everything you get and make sure you enjoy it. Well done!
