Hey all checking in on day 2 of my redo. Been ok on the drinking side of things haven't really craved anything...Been pretty depressed though. Currently unemployed (going on 5 months) didn't lose my job to drinking got downsized the old fashion way. ..I am just feeling so overwhelmed. I have so many things in my life that need improvement but I'm just feeling so out of it that motivation to do anything is difficult. My wife is really worried about me and thinks I'm not even trying. So many feelings swirling around in me. Regret for what I did while drinking and regret for not being more proactive in my career choices. Fear of mistakes and fear of difficulty. ..I know alcohol took so much from me and just not drinking means I'm one day closer to healing and feeling better but right now I'm in an overwhelmed stage. I know that one of the stages of this process is self acceptance but I'm struggling with that too. ..One thing I know I can do is not drink. So here is to not drinking and to my favorite community! I won't drink with you all today.

Congratulations on day 2.  The good news is everything is better (not easy) sans the alcohol.  I feel better each day.  I won't drink with you today.
I'm starting over too.  .Just think of all the things we can accomplish tomorrow while we are not tired with a headache!  I am already starting my to-do list.  I won't drink with you tonight my friend.
