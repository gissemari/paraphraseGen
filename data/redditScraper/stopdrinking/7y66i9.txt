I just felt so low. I made it to 10 days and just got drunk. Done some bad things last night and managed to alienate one of my flatmates...Fuck

Hey it's happened to many of us here but in the end each relapse has valuable information. I've read about your post break up and well i think you did everything very well posted (very good sign) ranted (you needed it and that's very healthy). Maybe next time we can help you when the craving arrives? Pick yourself up and keep going girls will come and go but alcohol tends to stay and its an ugly goblin i would pick the girls  . You can do this. Iwndwyt
Been there before. The important thing is that you recognize the negative impacts of your drinking and that you are back here.
Been there many times. The best thing you can do in this situation is think back to what lead up to you having a drink. What was the trigger and how are you going to make a different decision next time? 
You know that you can last for 10 days now. Get back on that wagon and beat that number. Aim for 30. You can do it.
When I quit drinking (it's been about 20 months now) I wrote down why I decided to stop. I looked back at that several times when tempted to pick up a drink. The biggest things that helped me though were going to AA and being able to call another sober alcoholic when I wanted to drink. 
What can you do differently this time to prevent another relapse? I had to add tools to my sobriety toolbox every time I picked up again.
Glad you're here..."Fall down seven; Get up eight".....Japanese Proverb..I needed support to be successful...Meetings helped me immensely.
