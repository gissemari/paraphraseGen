Not long ago I thought my chances at career progression were gone. Slowly I made some changes to my life. Learned a lot of things the hard way.  ..Not long ago I found this place and it found me at the right time. Thank you all for being so amazing and helping me with your stories of struggles and triumphs and struggles and triumphs. ..I'm away from home at a work conference which used to be a massive booze binge.  Not this time though.  ..I'm feeling strong but also humbled that I get this chance to be a better me.
