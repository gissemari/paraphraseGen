I don't even know how to begin this but I can't believe I've made it a year sober. The /SD community has been a great help and it's one of my main tools to stay sober...**Why I got sober**.I was thinking of posting a couple of examples of my alcoholism which I might but it's as simple as I can't drink in moderation. I'm 22 and started drinking in high school and I remember picking up that first drink man was it the best feeling on earth. I blacked out the first time i drank much the many of other nights I did. I continued to drink and "have fun" but I can count the times I had 1-2 beers on one hand. It was either don't drink at all or clear my whole schedule to have 12+ beers. After a 65 day stint my senior year in high school after failing out due to drinking/ not giving a damn about school I was still completely clueless I had a problem. I just liked to drink!..When I got to college in the fall of 2010 my drinking continued to go downhill. Until my sobriety date (2/7/2014) I didn't have one sober weekend. I used college as a mask for my alcoholism. I was in college so i'd drink! Once I moved off campus my junior year I completely isolated myself for a long time getting black out drunk by myself multiple nights a week. While everyone else was going out to parties and bars having a few drinks I was falling down in my room by myself. I fell into poor health had horrible memory loss gained a bunch of weight worsened my depression/ anxiety and felt completely alone because my drinking led me to cut off and alienate those that were closest to me. I continued to drink regardless of the obvious consequences. Towards the end of my drinking career I was a person that I hated. I wanted to stop drinking but I couldn't. It was habitual and confronting even though I've done things i'm not proud of. I began to drink and drive and one night I became pretty violent towards my (sober) girlfriend at the time and it was over nothing and I felt ashamed afterwards...I remember I went to go see one of my favorite bands play this time last year. I had been sober for 10 or 12 days and told myself I could have *three* beers at the concert and that would be it. I didn't drink in a awhile so i could obviously drink right? Wrong. I lied to my friends about being "tired" and bailed to go grab more booze and drank myself into oblivion. I eventually ran out of what I was drinking and began to drink this nasty Armeretto mixer and Nyquil. The next morning I woke up with (another) nasty hangover. I went for a bike ride and just couldn't do it. I went back home and slept the day away...I didn't drink that night and haven't picked up a drink since...**What's changed since I got sober**.-First off I'm in the best shape of my life. I dropped 35 pounds and can actually see the results of working out (something you don't see when you're drinking 40+ beers a week.) My blood pressure and heartbeat are way down and my liver isn't pulsing with occasional pain. More importantly I've earned a solid peace of mind. I went on anti-depressents which has helped me out a lot and i think a lot of the reason why I drink is because of the depression...I'm not a liar anymore and I'm a good friend/ son/ boyfriend/ human being. Before I would short change and use other people in order to get drunk. ..I cleaned up my act and started focusing on what's *actually* important to me: my friends girlfriend cycling and school. I graduated from a great university in December and for once i'm actually really excited about my future and being alive...**How I did it**.I'm not expert on sobriety but I think i've learned a little over the last year. The biggest thing for me was finding people to talk to about the disease. I started going to AA meetings and found a lot of comfort and reassurance. Whenever I get the thought "you know what maybe I'm not an alcoholic. I've been sober for one year so i can drink in moderation now!" i get my ass straight to an AA meeting...TL;DR: It's hard but sobriety is the single most rewarding thing i've ever given myself. Life's not perfect now but it's a hell of a lot better than i was drinking..

Awesome post buddy. I went to rehab when I was 23. I didn't have any prolonged sobriety again until 32. Seeing younger people like yourself potentially avoiding decades of pain is such a heartwarming experience. Keep doing what you're doing :)
What a great story.  As someone who knew I had a problem when I was your age but didn't do anything constructive about it for nearly another quarter of a century I'm glad to hear about success from younger people.  It gives me hope.  Keep on keeping on!
Happy birthday and congratulations! You're a great example to other young people in recovery.
I'm 20 myself and I've almost hit my 90 days. It's really cool hearing stories from other young people. Thanks for the inspiration man. At meetings I'll sometimes get the vibe that some folks don't realize how severe things can be even though we're young! 
Happy birthday /u/tinymovingparts! Keep up the good work.
Congrats on 1 year and thanks for sharing.
Congratulations buddy! You're an inspiration to me! I am 23 and just started going sober after a month of sobriety followed by a binge. ..One day at a time. 
Thanks for posting. This is awesome.
I am a year sober today too at 23! Good work!..I am in the best shape of my life I can do a pull up :P 
Huzzah!
Congrats!
I have about a week of sobriety and have very similar drinking styles to you. You are great inspiration man! 
Congratulations on one year! Keep going!
congratulations u/tinymovingparts!..Your story is really similar to mine. I too spend the end of my drinking in college alone in my room drinking basically daily to oblivion. It's nice to see someone who can also get out of the shit...I hope you do well in school in your working out with your relationships and with yourself mentally. Keep moving forward! The growth only gets bigger with more time sober!
Thank you for taking time to remind me why I am sober today.
Congratulations!!  It's really awesome that you figured things out so young.  I'm inspired :).
Awesome stuff! I saw a lot of parallels with your story! Congrats on a year And keep it up! Thanks for posting
