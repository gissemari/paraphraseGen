I've been struggling staying sober more than a few weeks for the past 2 or so years. Yesterday my partner who has been so helpful and supportive of me and my journey to get sober decided to end our relationship. It was amicable. I understand and she needs to do what's right for her. ..But now I'm really struggling. I don't have many friends. I'm a quiet guy. I go to Refuge Recovery every week but I don't know anybody. I feel so alone right now. ..TL;DR I'm going to find a meeting tonight. Just keep me in your thoughts.

The best place to be is outside of your own head and daily meetings if possible is a great way to think about yourself less.
At sad times like this I remember that there is nothing so bad that drinking alcohol won't make it worse. ..Stay in touch. A therapist helped me work through my grief after the end of a relationship.
