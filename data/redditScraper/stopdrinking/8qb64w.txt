	One thing I realized I'm concerned about is the fact that I *know* I'm going to relapse.  I think I mean with booze but it could be with any of my problems.  Could be drinking falling into a relationship with someone that's not right for me just to spare their feelings at the expense of my own my habits surrounding depression or my diet.  Something is bound to break down eventually.  This lifestyle takes so much vigilance and it all supports each other.  All it would take is one moment of weakness and it could all crumble.  I could find myself back at Square 1 when it was so hard to get where I am now which in reality is probably only like Square 3.  But that relapse is waiting somewhere around some corner in my life.  My BS wants me to return to the status quo and even now it's probably plotting a clever way to take me down with it.  I guess though it's not the relapse that will define me but how I deal with the aftermath..	The thing I have to remember is that I'm doing this for a reason.  I am treating myself so much better in order to invite better things opportunities and people into my life.  And when that awesome something comes for me I will be ready to accept it instead of being afraid - either to leave my BS behind or that I'll fuck it up in the future with the same BS.  I am not *pretending* to be my best self I am practicing the delicate art of becoming her every single day...	Every day I don't drink..	Every time I hit the gym..	Every time I tell the truth even when it's scary..	Every healthy meal I eat..	Every session in therapy..	Every moment I am grateful - and forgiving..	Every pattern I recognize and work to break..	All the new tools I am learning to utilize...	Everything together is supporting this New Better Me to emerge from the shell of the Old Me that god bless her was struggling so hard and wanted so much more..

I share similar feelings to those which you described. I always feel like I'm one bad phone call or crappy day at work away from binging on a bottle. And I have ended up at square one. A lot. ..I think a lot of times when someone is looking for life advice especially when it comes to giving up alcohol people tell them to "live for today"or "carpe diem!" after driving home the fact that no one is guaranteed a tomorrow or a five minutes from now. So why not live it up. ..Well. I can't do that. I find myself drinking hundreds of days in a row again. ..I have learned this. I have to make decisions and live my life for the future. Not the present. I have to make good choices for the me who has to live with them five minutes from now an hour from now and the next day. I can't just seize the day like everyone else who might want a scapegoat for their actions. I have to put a lot of energy into making sure future me has a higher chance at having a better life overall. That thought process helps me avoid anything that may derail my efforts at sobriety. 
Hey fellow 41!  Relapse doesn't have to be inevitable.  You and I both really could be done with all that - no more hangovers blackouts or binges *ever.*  We have that as a totally valid totally doable choice...Thank you for sharing the fruits of your mindfulness.  IWNDWYT.
