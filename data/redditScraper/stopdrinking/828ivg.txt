**Background info**: my previous sober streak before the current one lasted 24 days. (It was probably my all-time record ever since I was about 20.) I was doing pretty well then after the first week or so going days without the slightest craving. (What finally triggered my relapse was some cancelled plans on a Saturday when I had nothing to do.) ..This time I find I'm really struggling. Today I noticed that a part of my brain - "the addict me" I guess - is trying to convince me that if I stay sober until next weekend it'll be ok to drink on Saturday (and possibly on Sunday). I **don't want** to be thinking this way yet I can't seem to shut that voice up entirely. It's whispering to me very persuasively and seductively... (Imagine Gollum speaking LOL.) There are so many reasons why staying sober (and NOT relapsing) would be **good** for me - and so many reasons why drinking would be a **bad** idea. But I'm still worried I won't be able to stay strong...Any advice?

I have had this exact same problem. I think the way I finally stopped the voice was every time I had the thought of rewarding not drinking with drinking I would immediately think of as many positive things about being sober. 
I called that little voice the Booze Goblin and my head he sounded uncannily like Gollum too!..He's a repetitive little bastard and absolutely full of shit... every time you shut down his little games he gets weaker and eventually he more or less fades away altogether.....Remember *you're* in charge not the Booze Goblin... they are just thoughts after all and there is absolutely nothing compelling you to act on them!..I won't drink with you today keep us posted on how you're doing?..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
I hear that nasty little voice too ...Can you make plans to do something fun next weekend so you have something to look forward to that does not involve drinking ?..A hike somewhere new ? A trip to the nearest city to take in a museum or some shopping and maybe a movie ?..Do you have a partner or spouse or bestie that you could invite over for a day of binge watching netflix and ordering pizza ?
For a second when I read this title and entry I thought I was the one who posted it! ..That voice has gotten me more times than I can count. This morning I was listening to it. I was thinking I've made it this far maybe drinking Friday would be okay! But your post reminded me it's that stupid drink Gollum in my head. ..Just another reminder to take it one day at a time. I'll deal with Friday when it gets here.
