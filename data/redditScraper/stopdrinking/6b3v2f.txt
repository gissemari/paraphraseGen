I have full trust in myself now. It's been two weekends already where I go with my friends and I stayed sober. It gets easier and also harder. I know I can do this. I have way to many things to lose and I've already lost the woman I love. I will not lose my children. What I will lose is this idea of having to be drunk to enjoy life. I must be sober. I will continue foward. I'm struggling so much on the inside but this is only a phase. I will not drink with yall today.

It's weird that I thought drinking was any sort of reward at all because it was actually a perverse sort of punishment to my body and spirit.  I guess that's addiction.    ..Congrats on your early success!  You could grab a badge from the sidebar if you like some people find them motivating.  
Keep up the good work! I will not drink with you today!
