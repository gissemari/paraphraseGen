When I first stopped drinking I found a lot of support posting on this sub. I changed my ways and quit drinking cold turkey. For whatever stupid reason I relapsed around day 30. I was doing really well. So much energy I went to the gym or did yoga at least 4 times a week and the cleanliness of my apartment was night and day from before. ..Fast forward to a month sober and my girlfriend and I were fighting we had a pregnancy scare and emotions were high. I thought it was somehow an ok idea to grab a bottle of soju and head to a nearby park and write in my notebook. Oh I'm doing something constructive I'm sober now I can use this bottle to help me see things more clearly...You all know how the rest goes drinking on and off for over a month straight until I had a couple of blackouts and days just trying to recover by drinking more to dull the aches and pains of a turbo-hangover. ..I'm starting the good fight again as of yesterday and I'm not going to beat myself up over my mistake. I've been walking this dark path for years of my life and must give credit that I want to change and succeeded for 30 days. ..I'm not going to make this mistake again. I would have been so proud of myself if my badge was at 70 days but seeing how fast time can go by I know I will accomplish that goal... and beyond!

Welcome back! Be proud of yourself right now for deciding to stop again :) I'm not drinking with you today.
I won't drink with you today.  Don't be rough on yourself.  It's great you came back.  I also did a number of times alcohol free for a few weeks or a month over a one year period and I too am starting fresh.    The great news is you have had success and you can have it again.  
Welcome back. I am on day 2 myself so you are not alone!
