Hey! You guys are so helpful and I love talking to you. This really feels like a place in which I can confide young nonalcoholic or not. Can I ask some advice though? I'm sure many of you also have this problem so I'll cut to the chase. I'm fine whenever I'm talking to people I know as good friends but anyone else I'm extremely shy around. I often find myself struggling to find words and blushing a lot more around people I'm not used to interacting with. Any ideas on how to overcome this?

Is this when you're sober? Or in general? 
I had this same problem several years ago and took improv classes to see if I could get over my social uneasiness. It worked! Not immediately but it worked. It was one of the best things I've ever done for myself.
