I recently went through a rehab program and was given naltraxone during my stay to alleviate cravings- etc. ..When I left the program my PCP didn't renew the naltraxone saying I should be fine on other drugs. I relapsed withing a few days of stop taking it- after having been sober 30 days. ..I just re-started the prescription and have no desire to drink. My family has a history with MS as well as a history with alcoholism- i jut found out naltraxone is used to treat both...I thought this was really odd.

Just as a side note to the above my recent drinking had no social function at all- I was drinking until nothing was in the house and would go and get more as long as I could walk. The more I drank the more I needed to drink- I was on some recent binge having a beer every 10-15 minutes and then feeling an uncontrollable urge to have more. And mentally- I'd feel awake/exited where obviously my body was suffering deeply after 2-3 days straight of non-stop binges. Up to 35+ beers a day equivalent. 
Naltrexone was very helpful in the first couple of weeks of my current sobriety I had about half a bottle left over from a few months before when my former psychiatrist prescribed it to me (but I ultimately stopped taking it and returned to drinking). ..It's a very useful medication but I don't see it mentioned very often on here for whatever reason. 
I know a lot of people in my support group who had good results from naltraxone.
I used a Vivitrol shot 30 days of no drinking!  Loved it!
