Hey SD. I'm finishing up day 35 and generally feeling very good. I saw a therapist for six months and today we wrapped up our work. It was quite helpful. I more or less took the past six months off to just get better as my drinking and drug use had gotten so severe that I couldn't work and was suicidal. ..Now I'm feeling better and am sort of supposed to start working again but am incredibly overwhelmed. I work in media and therefore have to live my life somewhat in public (at least in the part of the world I'm in). I'm supposed to be making some appearances on  shows putting out a documentary and writing a book and dealing with publicists in two countries among many other things. I have a very complicated relationship with being semi in public person and I'm not sure I'm fully ready for it to get more intense. I was using and drinking when I sort of crossed over into this more visible life though I hid my addictions well for the first two years; the last two years I hid it considerably less well. ..I find the pressures strangers put on me and the way a lot of people need me very intrusive and stressful. For some reason it's incredibly triggering for me probably the most triggering thing. It takes me outside of myself and my own needs and in the past I frequently used or drank to override the cues that told me to take care of who I really am rather than this persona whose job it is to deal with other people. But this is my reality and what I do for work and there's no changing it. I just know that it becomes dangerous for me to let public pressure get to me. And now I'm done with therapy so I'm feel even less contained...I fear I'm going too fast. I've spent the last few months doing great work with my therapist learning how to slow down and eventually coming to the conclusion that I needed to get sober -- the best decision I've ever made. ..Now I'm supposed to rejoin the world. Today in an effort to jumpstart all these projects and push myself to get ready to put myself out there again I drank so much coffee that I threw up. This did not seem like a good sign. Any comments would be appreciated.
