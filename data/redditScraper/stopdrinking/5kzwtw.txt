I'm happy people are here and sharing. Say what you will about AA or any other program; it's the community of people struggling with the same dis-ease that is important. I couldn't have admitted to my alcoholism without the good people in AA and the good people on forums like this. I'm here to go through the struggle with you and to learn and lean on the experienced recovered alcoholics. Thanks and God bless.

AA does not have a monopoly on recovery but it's the group that helped me so I'm all for it. There's something special about being able to travel essentially anywhere and find a meeting if that's what you need (I'm from Atlanta and am currently on holiday in SW Australia).
