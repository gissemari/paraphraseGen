I knew it was gonna be hard (this wasnt first time experiencing it) Locked in bed and cam barely move. No appetite food for or water. Aches all over shacked when you try to move anything. I was getting better at the end. But what set it off was the sleep... I was hallucinating really bad. Hours and hour of hallucinations asleep or awake. It was constant and confusing and straight up terrifying. I probably slept for 1 hour. ..So you could say I relapsed tonight. Had another drink or two to hopefully just keep the demons at bay :/ I'm working for it. But I am a bit scared to go to bed right now..

Hang in there!..I spoke to a physician and asked for medical management for withdrawal......Then everything went safely and remarkably without any issues!
You have to stay hydrated. DO not have to eat but have to drink fluids. It is good to drink something that has electrolytes in it like gaterade. IWNDWYT
