And then I cut myself in shame. I kinda just want to die. I know I shoudl just wake up and get back on the wagon tomorrow but I want to self destruct into oblivipn to numb the anxiety I feel right now. I just need someone to talk to and nobody is around. I feel helpless inside myself

::hug:: ..I myself was in a dark mental state last night. I let myself have a good cry made some comfort food and out on The Jungle Book to fall asleep to. Sometimes it's easy to fall down the rabbit hole and get caught in the cycle of negative thoughts. Anytime I distract myself it seems to help. Also sometimes I'll force myself to listen to some of my favorite upbeat songs and I'll go for a drive by myself to get my mind right. Not sure if that helps just know you're not alone!
Sorry to hear that you're having a tough time.  It sounds like you have some other issues going on besides drinking.  I'd really suggest getting help for these as well.   Just remember alcohol is only going to make those conditions worse.  It really doesn't help at all.  Our minds tell us it will but in reality it doesn't.

Don't beat yourself up.  This stuff is hard.  So much harder than I would have thought.  I probably tried to quit 5 times a year for 5 years so I failed over twenty times before realizing that for me to quit I had to do something drastic.  For me that was biting the bullet and attending a support group.
