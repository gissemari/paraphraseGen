Didn't make it to AA yesterday. The only meetings I could find that fit into my schedule were late in the evening and as I hadn't slept much the night before I decided that it was probably better to aim for an early night (I was so tired that I probably wasn't safe to be on the road). I have found an earlier meeting that fits into my schedule today that I will be going to. ..I keep catching myself thinking that going to AA is an overreaction to my drinking habits. No no it's not. I'm glad that I've been keeping track on here and on an app on my phone. It's so easy to forget how bad things get. This sub really has helped me. I'm no longer really struggling with drinking during the week but weekends are problematic. I don't want to become complacent and go on being a weekend drinker because I know where that leads. So I need to develop a support system especially for the weekends. ..I still haven't reset my badge. I like looking at the numbers going up. I am going to use them as inspiration for a little while but will reset soon. I hope everyone is having a great week and will choose not to drink today with me.

Nice job on 9 days friend. AA and /r/stopdrinking have been the 1 - 2 punch that has kept me sober this long. AA is really great for accountability. Getting the phone numbers of other alcoholics and calling them when I feel like drinking has saved my ass multiple times. 
&gt;It's so easy to forget how bad things get...YES. This 1000 times...SD and AA help me remember this even when I don't want to.  Hang in there.  I won't drink today with you.  :)
