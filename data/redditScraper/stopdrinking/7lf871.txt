Relapsing is not fun. I felt guilty. Embarrassed. Pitiful..It's happened in the past....To a new person to sobriety what are ur tips on being sober? ..

Don't put the booze in your mouth.It gets easier .Make it positive embrace new things or restart old ones you've left far behind without really meaning to.Have some sort of support system.Focus on what you really want not on the things you don't need anymore .     some good stuff I like .
Take it one day at a time and each day simply commit to not having the first drink.  It might sound simple but in reality that is what it takes...I know where one glass of wine would inevitably lead me so I choose not to drink.  Nobody can ever force me to drink.  Were I to do so it would be my choice but for the past 355 days I have chosen not to and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.  ..To be honest it isn't even a decision I have to make any more.  I no  longer drink alcohol and the mere thought of doing so doesn't even cross my mind.  It is simply wonderful to be free from the hell hole of the prison that I was in for all those years and nothing will make me go back there..
