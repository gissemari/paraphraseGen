I'll keep this as concise as I can.  Basically my family (both sides for me in this case) has a history of depression alcoholism and addiction. When I entered middle school depression hit me hard my parents thought it was a phase and I would outgrow it. The only reprieve I found was through a game very similar to World of Warcraft. I became so addicted that 3-4 hours of sleep was  every night was normal and isolation was my best friend outside of 2 close friends. At the age of 20 I found out that I was going blind due to a disease called Choroideremia. This is when I started to drink alcohol. At first socially with my band and friends then throughout the next 12 years of my life and a couple of heavy drinking relationships later the last 2 years of my life have been in a downward spiral. This past July I lost my career of 10 years most of my family has despairing hope but there's still one friend by my side and it really means a lot. ..While depression and blindness is debilitating in its own right alcoholism is just as bad if not worse because of the health effects. At this point in my life I can officially say I have hit "rock bottom". I've gone through periods of sobriety and relapsed.  Each time coming out of the haze realizing how much more damage alcohol has done. I'm tired of feeling tired sick and depressed. Alcohol separates you from love.  Drinking my blindness away won't help me or anyone else. I want to help people not feel helpless. I want to set an example for my younger siblings not be "that family member". I want to find my SO and be proud to have each other wherever we go. ..The bottom line is alcohol is like a bad relationship. You always think it will get better over time but it only gets worse...Thank you for reading and your support.
