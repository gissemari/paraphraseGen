Triumph: Getting my community service hours done I have 7 straight days that I'm going to do. Was worried about the whole week being done and over with and my mom looks at me and says "Take it one day at a time honey isn't this what it's all about anyways?" ..Struggle: Surrender. I had a week of it. It was perfect and beautiful and I was happy. Then I started resisting again. I mean if I don't have something to worry about and to try to control what am I doing with my life right? I had a fellow alcoholic build me a beautiful "GOD BOX" last week for my 6 month. I haven't used it yet. My struggle is making these things that I'm having control problems with into the box. ..General chat: It's beautiful outside. And I get to spend time in it! Once this community service is all done my summer (though technically half-over school-wise) BEGINS! I have 5 days off in a row and am camping with my AA home group. I"M SO FREAKING EXCITED GUYZ. 
**Triumph:**  Just hit 10 months sober recently.  Also I have a lot more peace recently about an issue I'm having with my girlfriend.  ..**Struggle:**  Got another tax bill from the IRS for tax year 2012.  Now I owe them around $1800.  Not awful but I'm going to be paying on that for a while...**General Chat:** I'm headed home to the beach for July 4th with my girlfriend.  Pretty excited about that.
**Triumph:** Alone for an extended stay in a hotel - decided to be the man I want to be rather than a drunk who can get away with it because no one is around to see...**Struggle:** There is going to be plenty of alone free-time and stress for another 2 weeks. Need to stay occupied and focused on sobriety...**General chat:** Very happy with the change to cooler climates.
Triumph:I didn't drink yesterday!..Struggle: Depression. Cravings. Fuck em...General Chat: Tried some green tea and honey hagen daze ice cream. Might sound peculiar and some might hate it but I thought it was awesome!
**Triumph:** Went to a wedding and didn't have a drop. ..**Struggle:** The fucking humidity in New York right now is ridiculous. No alcohol related struggles... For now... Even after two months my body still isn't used to the calorie deficit created by not drinking daily. I keep cycling between constipation and diarrhea all while having a substantial amount of fiber in my diet... I switched my diet up to include a ton of leafy greens good amount of protein and lowered carbs down to about 50g a day via complex grains and fruit. Still have not adjusted.... ..**General Chat:** I was flipping through /r/fitness and I realized this morning that with all the male progress pics that seem to make it to the front page it kinda is the sfw men version of gonewild... 
**Triumph**: Actively trying to be more grateful. Also I seem to be making some progress with my therapist...**Struggle**: Anger anger anger all the time. Angrily obsessing over every little thing including things out of my control of course. A hunnit serenity prayers can't tell me nothin'. Anger is at least a change of pace from just depression but man is it tiring. I get so worked up!..**General Chat**: Got to see my best friend for the first time since she moved 2600 miles away last September and it was really great.
Triumph: I was FINALLY offered a job today...Struggle: The process of separating from the Navy finding employment and dealing with drunk friends and family...General: I'm running a 5k on the 4th with my wife and pushing both our kids in a stroller.
**Triumph:** Today is has been a month since my last drink...**Struggle:** Thinking about my very last week with it and all the withdrawal process I went through and due to my stubborn self did it on my own locked inside my place ignoring family friend and work for a week. I don't desire that on anyone that I can current think of...**General Chat:** Spending the weekend by the ocean with friends and looking forward to it and wishing all of you guys not only a great weekend but a really great life..P.S: Pardon my English if anything... 
Triumph: Booked a holiday to Uluru. First solo sober holiday...Struggle: PTSD flash back this week - gah. I can't believe I lived like this every day it's been a while since this headspace has come out to play. ..General chat:  called Salvation Army and have the date set to move some stuff clogging up my home. Long over due.

Triumph: After waiting far too long I finally got a haircut and trimmed down the beard.  The breeze felt soooo good on my head when I went for a ride later...Struggle: I sweat way too easily..General Chat: Kind of upset that the 4th is gonna be a washout here.  One of my jobs is closing town parking lots at night kicking people out and whatnot.  The 4th is always one of the most entertaining nights to do that job because everyone is outside shooting off fireworks and having a good time.  Be a shame for everyone to be stuck inside that night.
Triumph: still here still sober and settling into my skin...Struggle: last few days have tough. Depression coming on work not going well all those things that add up...Chat: looking forward to things that go bang and boom.
Triumph:  Over a month sober.  I am learning to let things go to not try to control everything.  I am getting further along in not letting other people's expectations of me get in my way.  Another triumph is going out for celebratory drinks with people from work and ordering a lemonade.  And loving it...Struggle:  My marriage is looking grim...General Chat:  Got really into watching Fame the 1980s TV show this week.
Triumph: Got up and did my run at 5:45 am in 80 degree heat..Struggle: 80 degree heat! And a slightly unstructured 3 day weekend. Unscheduled time has been problematic for me in the past so tomorrow I'm going to pack my weekend schedule with movies yoga and maybe a meeting or two..General chat: I'm seeing a new therapist who is kind of opposite of what I would really want in a therapist but I'm giving her a chance. I really would just love someone to walk me through The Feeling Good Handbook help me identify my cognitive distortions etc. This one is really pushing me to do a "90 in 90" which just ain't gonna happen. But hey I committed to a few more sessions so I'l stay open to it for now. 
**Triumph**: made an offer for a house...**Struggle**: the above is utterly terrifying. I almost hope it is rejected. ..**General Chat**: I fucking hate the world cup *grumble grumble luis suarez grumble*..
triumph: for the past two weekend I attended  pride events in both my hometown and where I live now. Normally at these events I'd get blackout drunk and wake up regretting most of the decisions I made the day before. I made it through both of these events sober and had a great time. I woke up this Sunday and was able to do some homework help my new roommate move in and go hang out at the beach. I had this moment where I for the first time felt profoundly great flu to be sober. I'm participating in life in a way that I couldn't for years. being sober is awesome...struggle: I'm sooo tired and ready for this semester to end
