So I spent last night with friends down the street who had New Years party and I didn't drink even though everyone else did (except my wife who is pregnant) and I had a blast. It was surprisingly much easier and more fun than I thought it would be. In reflecting on it today and my 10 days sober I thought I'd share some observations I've gleaned from reading this subreddit and my experiences that other people starting fresh might find of interest...1. Listen to the words of wisdom of those who have large amounts of time under their belt - but remember everyone is different - many people would have told me at 10 days not to go to a party with lots of alcohol but for me because my mindset was clear that I wanted to go to not drink and have fun I felt 90% safe in my decision - had I been nervous at all then I would recommend one not put themselves in such a situation so early - listen to your mind as much as to others advice you know yourself best. I was talking to someone on here in a similar situation and based on their mindset I recommended they not go to a party last night because their mind wasn't ready for it...2. Find someone and email them and encourage and support them especially if they are/were in a similar situation to yourself - someone emailed me when I started and said X number days ago they were just like me and it meant a lot - and the other day I emailed a person and said hey I am very similar to you - remember we are not alone and many of us have traveled similar paths into this addiction so it helps to have words from those who traveled the path as we travel out to sobriety. (in other words pay it forward :) )..3. There probably is no "one way" and this subreddit encourages many different approaches - look into them all! I knew about Allen Carr before I came here but many don't - years ago I thought the only way was AA and I just didn't like that idea because of my personality it didn't seem to be right for me - now that I've started the path through Easyway and other books and changing my mindset I find I may be open to going to an AA meeting in the future. Find something to help you start the path - there are many ways to start and many ways to travel the path - our goal is all the same - a happy healthy future :)..4. Read the stories and posts here and talk to people - but don't over do it - I was reading the great success stories when I first got here and it was inspiring then I started reading relapse stories and I got disheartened then I saw acceptance after those relapses and got encouraged again - but after awhile take a break - read another subreddit read a book go exercise make sure you focus on spending some time to make yourself happy without alcohol and work on the wonderful future we are all heading towards. Alcohol has been such a big part of our lives for so long I believe is important as part of recovery to start doing reading and thinking about things that have nothing to do with alcohol to help build a better self...5. The baby steps are very very helpful - coolcrosby posts them for everyone :) - it worked with tobacco for me to - if I have tough day I just say ok if you still feel like you want a drink tomorrow when you wake up then maybe you can have one but not today - today I'm not drinking. Then when I wake up sober and feeling great I never feel the urge to drink and I recommit...That's all I have for now - I've just been enjoying a happy sober New Years day and as the fog lifts my mind has been thinking all these random thoughts. So even if it only helps or encourages one new person to stay strong then it was worth it! Happy New Year all! Thanks for all your support! .
