This isn't my first detox/sobering up stint I've gone two months so far so I'm about halfway to my record. Those times I sobered up were only temporary though I knew I would drink after I got past the finish line - so to speak. It certainly feels different knowing that I haven't given myself an end-date to being sober. Some thoughts I've had over the past few weeks:..It's eye-opening how buzzed I was on a regular basis I've appreciated a lot of little moments where I am sober and in the right mind to enjoy them. Some things I thought I didn't care for or couldn't stand really were affected by drinking being hungover or blinded by the drive to find and consume more alcohol...I survived Easter without drinking and for the first time played with my little nephew who I otherwise would ignore or steer clear from as I was on a mission to drink at family events. That was pretty cool...I survived travelling and a wedding without drinking which was huge for me as the drive to check out new breweries was huge. It's amazing the hidden support network of people who are alcoholics in recovery that I otherwise wouldn't interact with. At the wedding one of the ladies who was going around refilling wine and champagne glasses started filling my wine glass and I told her it wasn't necessary. She then came back with champagne and I told her I wouldn't need it either she then asked if I didn't drink at all and I said I didn't. She then proceeded to tell me that she had stopped drinking as well and we chatted about how much better life was. She then ran off and came back with some sparkling NA cider which I really appreciated...My entire family has struggled with alcohol after I decided to sober up my little brother approached me asking about AA meetings and how they were. I just thought he was being supportive but he confided in me the other day that he had stopped drinking. I was proud of him and proud that I could be a good example for once to my siblings...Being a huge craft beer fan I find that I crave trying new beer more than actually having the desire to get buzzed for drunk. Part of me still really really wants to be able to drink casually but I know that on a long enough timeline it will lead to me going on a bender(s). My GF is very supportive but I've also found myself resenting some things she says about me never drinking again as if she is the one imposing this limitation on me and it takes mental exercise to re-associate the decision to stop drinking back to myself...I'm sure there's more but right now that's what comes to mind I'm looking forward to another month sober and I thank you all for sharing your stories and showing support! I will not drink with you today!

It's wonderful being able to talk and confide in family especially siblings that have struggled the same way you have. My family too has struggled with alcohol and addiction. I have seen my brother at the very bottom with drugs and alcohol and has been able to get himself out of it. He is an inspiration to me and someone I can talk to...Congrats on not drinking! Keep it up! I will not drink today!
