Last night I had such a terrible night.  I sat bawling at the kitchen table and was able to talk to my SO and feel better.  I went to bed and slept okay but woke up with the sadness hangover.  ..And I thought to myself today that if I didn't drink last night when I was struggling so hard with so many emotions then I cannot allow myself to give into some bullshit triggers like a party or FOMO or wanting a beer because I mowed the lawn.  I can't give in because I'm too lazy to make a better plan.  I can't give in for nothing after I have not given in on the very hard days.  ..Truth is that when I was busy drinking too much I didn't need a reason or a trigger.  I hated drinking by the end because I did it when I didn't even have a decent reason for it.  That's some stupid shit because I was steadily beating myself daily for my behavior. I'm very clear I will not be drinking any of you today.

Think of it like this if you're doctor said to you "memymomonkey you're extremely allergic to peanuts and if you eat peanuts again in your life there's a high possibility you might drop dead.." -- Would you ever eat peanuts again? I think not. ..That's how I look at my alcoholism. You can't change what's happened in your past but you can certainly change what's going to happen as you move forward in life. Congrats on your 53 days!
