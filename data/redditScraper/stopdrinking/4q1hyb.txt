Never thought I'd be that person. ..I had two years drank on a date. I had 2 months drank on a date. A few days ago I had 3 months ago and I had a date. And I drank. I feel like I'm doomed. NONE of these times has ever come close to feeling "worth it." AA was so effective for me when I first found it but it's like a bandaid I keep ripping off and trying to re-apply -- its ability to stick is wearing out. I've called my contacts in the program but even they are losing patience with me. I'm assured that they don't hate me but talking to me is understandably getting difficult for the people I keep turning to for these fuck ups...I'm a chronic relapser. I NEVER thought I'd be this way but the disease has me in its grips and I feel so fucking stuck... I absolutely don't know what to do. I have trouble making connections to people always have and it's driving me to self-destruct. I want so badly to make the isolation go away but the feeling is always here with me.

You had two years.  You know you can do it.  Don't psych yourself out.  You CAN DO THIS!!!!  Perhaps you need to redefine your dating strategy.....at least in the beginning.  Don't go anywhere where alcohol is served.  I know dating can be awkward and alcohol helps you relax but it isn't worth your health and sobriety.   Try daytime dating for a while so you can avoid things like bars and restaurants.  Go to a museum. Play mini golf.  Go to a flea market gallery hiking.  There is less pressure to drink during the day and still plenty to do.  Good luck!
You still have those years and those months and those days sober. .You can do this.
