YAAAAYYY!! I'm honestly celebrating the fact that I hadn't even realized it had gone by but more so that the one year since my last drink had gone by without me realizing...if that makes sense...Well to be honest the first few months were a little bit of a hellscape. I was moody irritable and constantly questioning my decision because I found it hard to live a life especially a social life as a guy in his mid 20s. Calling it tough is the understatement of the century. But after a while I started realizing that when I came home from hanging out with friends I could remember all that happened I could get some sleep wake up without feeling depressed and suicidal start a new day show up for work walk with a little more confidence in my step make it to the gym (lost over 40lbs this past year) pay debts and bills (for the most part) and actually laugh at things because I find them funny. I'm no success story by any means. There are still days where I struggle with the decision and life in general but I can say without any doubt that I wouldn't trade the clarity I have for anything. ..Thanks guys for reading about a 2posting lurker and I can't tell you how much reading your stories and having you guys with me on this journey has meant to me.
