I'm on day 17 right now. This is the third time I've quit this year. Previous attempts have seen me replacing alcohol with food and especially sweets. This time that hasn't even really been a thought. I've always struggled with sticking to a routine getting to work on time and I've never been one to care about how my hair looks. The past couple of weeks I've stuck to my routine to a tee. I'm getting to work between 7-7:30am when in the past I've struggled to be in by 9am when I'm supposed to be in by 8am. Getting in earlier before everyone else can distract me I get so much more done. I can leave by 3:30 everyday and have a ton more time in the evening to have a life. I've finally decided to do something semi-professional with my hair. I don't even know who I am anymore but I like it this new person. He's dependable on time and looks fresh as hell. I've been taking steps towards starting my own business and trying to get it insured (as well as recent news happening) has made me realize what a liability alcohol is. I had my biggest show yet over the weekend and literally ran out of business cards. Things are going well just gotta keep this positivity in line and not let it get the best of me. There's nothing good at the bottom of that empty glass!

This is awesome. Good read.
Good for you! I'm not going to lie I'm giving myself 4-6 weeks of grace period to slack on other things while I'm focusing on my sobriety after which I'm hoping to establish more healthy habits.
Sounds like you have a great new routine. Good for you!  Great things are happening.  .
