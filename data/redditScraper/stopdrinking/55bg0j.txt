I am about 500 days sober and I am so bored. I am alone 90 percent of the time and I am really thinking of going back out over it.

What made me decide to quit was finishing a bottle of wine and realizing I was just as bored and lonely after drinking it as I had been before. I'm alone 90% of the time too except reading this sub makes me feel like I'm not. I'll not drink with you tonight.
