Am 'celebrating' my 4 years of sobriety today with a cup of tea.  ..To those of you out there that may be struggling or finding alcohol-free living increasingly difficult - **you can do it!**..The confidence that achieving 4 years sobriety has given me has been far greater than any false confidence that alcohol gave me itself...Have a great day everyone!
