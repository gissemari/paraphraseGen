After a week of struggling with emotions a few nights of off and on binging and finally admitting to both myself and to my boyfriend that I have a problem with booze I have spent all day reading here! I don't feel so alone anymore or so abnormal! You guys have posted such great information and advice and I love the support you give eachother. I am not worried about myself tonight day 1 always is no biggy but once it gets to day 2 or 3 I fool myself I can just have one or two and I make the same mistake of having 3 4 5 6.... Next day I'm kicking my own ass again. Again I'm sooo happy you guys are here... and I think this subreddit is going to help me make a huge change in my life! Thanks for all of your past posts and advice!

The definition of insanity - Doing the same thing over and over expecting different results...All of us alcoholics have been there before thinking that next time we will be able to control it. The fact of the matter is that once we've picked up that first drink we completely lose the choice of whether to drink another and another after that. ..Congratulations on your decision to quit. Recognizing you have a problem is the first step.
Congrats on joining us.  I'm two weeks in and find /r/sd really helpful.  Hopefully you've got some good people outside of the internet who you can talk to as well.  All the little building blocks help.  Both on and offline.  
I know that feel.  The first week I just sat on this reddit and kept checking my badge until it changed haha
Same time frame similar situation.  They've been really helpful here too!..http://webchat.snoonet.com/?channels=%23stopdrinking.
Yay - welcome! Definitely commit to this sub start getting involved and posting yourself. It helps - lots. 
Welcome! I'm exactly the same I can go for 2 or 3 days without wanting a drink. It's after then that I start craving a drink and once I have one it's game over. Congrats on making the choice to stop I wish you all the best!
First congratulations on taking the hardest step you'll have to take in recovery: admitting you have a problem.  It gets easier and better from here...Stick around and post whenever you need to this is a great place to get sober.  Have you ever checked out AA?
