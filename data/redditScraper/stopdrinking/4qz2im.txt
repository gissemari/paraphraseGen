Struggled to beat 14 days but now I made it through this weekend. A busy week last week and a visitor all weekend keeping me occupied has helped. Here's to another fortnight! ..Also... Last week was truly shit. But it would have been worse drunk. Heh

High five!
Keep on keeping on. 
You're doing great!
Ever see a guy in his 40s do the worm on his living room floor? That's what I'm doing for you right now. Stay sober and I'll stop. 
Yessssss!! Way to go Scrampy. And even more kudos because last week was truly shit and you still kicked ass ;)
I love these posts. 2 weeks is such a difficult time..
