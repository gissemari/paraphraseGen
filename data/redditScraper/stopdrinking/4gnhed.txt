Have had a shocker today. Work has been crazy stressful lately the kind of day where you barely get a chance to eat and you end up leaving late and all you want is to relax on the couch with some mindless tv and a glass of liquid relaxation...I booked some leave as my sister was visiting interstate with my 1 year old niece. I've been so excited for the respite from work in addition to seeing my family who I never see. I was also looking forward to telling my sister who has often expressed concern that I'm no longer drinking...This morning (she's due tomorrow) she calls to say my niece has gotten hand foot and mouth from friends who didn't bother telling her their son had it. She can't travel and she's cancelled the flights and she's sorry. And I'm gutted. It's no ones fault it is how it is but I'm devastated. .No point being alone for a week as I'm struggling in the evenings as it is so I've cancelled leave and am already swamped with meetings and more work...But no matter how much I want to cry or punch a wall I will not drink. I reached seven days today the longest I've gone sober since I can remember. I won't ruin that. I want to see 8 I want double digits I want a star. So today I won't drink. ..Tl;dr: had a shit day but won't let it ruin my streak ..

great outlook on a dissapointing situation. think of how you will be able to tell your sister how long you have been alcohol free when she does get a chance to visit! 
Good move getting busy. I'm at my most dangerous left alone with my thoughts while being bored. Keep it up!
