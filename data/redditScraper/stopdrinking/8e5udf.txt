Long-time lurker first time poster. Today is my first day again of being sober after a relapse and I am feeling so down. I could really use some support or advice...I just went through a breakup this last week and today I am fully dealing with the emotions. The day it happened my mind just went to oh better start drinking. I've been to rehab and I go to groups. So I know how to deal with cravings and stopping negative emotions. But this time I didn't even fight it I just didn't want to feel pain and so I drank. I picked up right where I had left off and I am disappointed in myself...This last week has been just a constant reminder of how bad alcohol is for me though. First I called up my ex I couldn't tell you a single word from that conversation though. So that meant I had to damage control the next day apparently I hadn't said any thing rude. We just talked which is surprising for me because I'll admit I can be a mean drunk. Second is how bad I get cravings. I was severely sick that next day of my relapse but because I still had alcohol leftover and in front of me I wanted to drink. Third was how lousy I felt emotionally and physically. I just started a new job and here I am doing my best not to act hungover in training. Fourth and last one was all the spending I do on alcohol...Right now I'm trying to remind myself that the last relationship was not healthy (from either of our sides) and that this will get better. But god do I want to drink right now. I plan on going to group later but I still have five hours before that starts so I'm trying to stay busy which I guess where this rant came in. ..Here's to day one of sobriety and not drinking today!

Hi - I'm back on day 7 after a relapse. We're only human and we all make mistakes. Please don't beat yourself up - at least not for too long. Take that energy and use it for good not evil :-)
