A fine and [hearty hello](https://tenor.com/xyVl.gif) to you wonderful SD peeps!  Hope things are going well for you all. ..We're aware of the current issue with the badges not showing for some people or not updating for others. It's been an ongoing issue for quite some time and at this time we're still looking for a more permanent solution to address it. For some context: ..When stopdrinking first started the human connection of replying and hand editing of badges was one of the core things that we thought was important. It's still handled by hand to this day some many years and  one hundred sixty thousand subscribers later. ..Because for a lot of people the badge reset is a deeply personal and sensitive thing and as mods we're often the first and only person they might be admitting the relapse to and we feel that having an actual human reach out is important to let that person know they're not alone. [Because we're never alone in this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s-dSoDptVc)..But with the sheer number of users on the subreddit we're also running into some growing pains. The current system as we have it was never designed to scale with the growing population and as such these issues with badges were always coming and we knew one day it would come to this point. ...We're still looking into solutions so we can still provide that human personal touch to our system but it's taking time for us to find a [sustainable solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aWVN91qGM8) for this not just for now but the [future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbR999N5MiA). ..So please bear with us as we continue to work on finding our way through this. .._____..If you are noticing that your badge has not updated or is not showing you DO NOT NEED TO MESSAGE US. We know it's happening and it just clogs up our already full modmail.
