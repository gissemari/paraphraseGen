So after being three years sober and relapsing I'm now approaching 15 days without drinking (which is the best streak since my relapse)...Overall feeling pretty good anxiety levels are way down sleep is getting better sweats have reduced. But I'm starting to get used to this new improved baseline and the negative thoughts in my mind are popping up about stagnating...I know it's just my unconscious looking to sabotage my progress trying desperately to give me an excuse to drink. I just needed to write out how I'm feeling connect with the community that's helped me stay focused and move on from these thoughts...Thanks for the constant inspiration friends...I will not drink with you today.

I'm glad you're back! Congratulations on 2 weeks! I will not drink with you today!!
What got you through those three years besides SD? Taking action always helps me maintain focus.
