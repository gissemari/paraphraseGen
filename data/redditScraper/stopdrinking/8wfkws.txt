I mean it seemed so easy not to drink after a while that myself thought I could drink and then jump into not drinking easily again...That caused a year and a half relapse. I am finally getting back on the right track again. But I feel that temptation of overconfidence creeping into my psyche.

Understanding and accepting that I have a chronic condition called alcoholism helps me. It goes into remission but is never totally gone. If I start drinking again I know that eventually my life will fall apart. Alcohol is never an option. NEVER!
I decided thank the choice of sobriety or drinking is a life and death decision for me.  I was not endanger of dying physically any time soon but I was not living just existing in a nightmare for the bottle.  And I did start experiencing health problems that would have led to my death.  So when I think about that choice it's do I want to live or do I want to die. 
After reading This Naked Mind my urge to drink is practically nil so I'm not tempted very often at all these days thankfully. Whenever I do feel the urge I play the tape forward. I also keep in mind the many posts I've read like yours where people thought they could have one and then kept drinking for months or years ... so thank you for sharing! It helps.
