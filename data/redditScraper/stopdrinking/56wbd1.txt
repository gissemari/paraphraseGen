I posted briefly earlier today in the check in link about how my day was going today but wanted to post more here. Usually Monday's are my least favorite days of the week but this Monday I was more productive than I've been in a while. I am still struggling to gain my footing because alcohol has made me get so far behind in so many aspects of life but today was a good day. I went to my math class (instead of sleeping through it because of a hangover) went and got groceries ate lunch cleaned the house with my girlfriend and did all of that before work! I even had a great day at work today. I came home and instead of drinking like I would have done any other Monday I completed a theater critque for my class that was due at 12 am tonight. I know this doesn't seem like much but usually I would crack open a beer and think "fuck it" I'll do it tomorrow I've had a long day. And either take a letter grade worse than what I could have gotten or just not do an assignment at all because I'd choose drinking instead. Today I chose productivity and sobriety and this community has helped me so much!
