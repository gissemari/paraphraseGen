Yesterday was hell. I must have gotten some bad food at a Christmas party Friday night cuz starting at 8 a.m. and ending at midnight last night I was puking and had an enormous headache.  Anytime I even tried to take a sip of water I would puke it right back up so there was no way I could take any meds. Sound familiar?.Looking on the bright side I guess it's better to have food poisoning every now and then then relapsed and have to go through that hell...
