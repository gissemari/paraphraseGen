Heard this was a good place for support when quitting the sauce for good. I've been trying for over a year seriously but have only about 5 month periods of continuous sobriety at a time at most before I relapse. I've got everything I need and so much going for me now I don't want to lose it all again in the cycle of having everything going great then blowing it all over a drink. Thanks in advance for your help any advice about what to do on the weekends or with time you can't be around your support system?

Congratulations!! I'm on day 9 myself. I've found keeping busy is personally my best option. I've taken up some old hobbies pick up the gym again to organized my apartment six times. Taken myslef out for walk anything really to just stay busy. I've also called old friends I havnt talked to in years just to catch up with people if I feel I need people around. Not the hey I'm going sober and need a friend atm but just a hey how are you doing because some time it's nice to just hear a voice. There are millions of things out there to keep us busy. As people we just got to find ones we like more than the sauce.
I check in several times a day and read other's posts. They help me and occasionally post myself. I found SD on day 3 and I wouldn't be where I am without the support I get here. Our 'motto' is IWNDWYT (I will not drink with you today.) I am on day 141. Badges that track our sobriety are down.
I am beginner much like yourself but everything in the world will open up. You can read exercise start a new hobby to keep yourself busy during the weekends. You can always reach out to us on reddit if you are away from your support system.
