Roommate went out of town I thought I was going to be fine with some drinks. I had to drunk text a couple friends last night on a three-day bender (one local and one fellow sobernaut) - she arranged to meet me with breakfast and gatorade this morning and just let me vent. ..The most annoying part is that I KNEW how much the comedown hurts and I even mentioned that I was dreading it even while being drunk. Didn't sleep a wink hot shaky annoyed. Still hot shaky annoyed. (I did at least go to the ER for a checkup. Guy said that I'm going to be hot shaky and annoyed but not a short-term health risk pumped a bag of saline into me. )..Haven't eaten much today stomach hurts too much to eat although food would probably fix it. I'm going to run to the grocery store for some bananas I think. I've doubled up on my daily Prevacid some Zofran and had them shoot me up with Zofran too. ..I guess this answers the question I had planned about breaking sobriety on vacation next week - hell fucking no. Going to be at a casino plus open bar plus I already bought some drink vouchers for the plane. ..Wall of text. Rambly. Just had to get words out into the ether. I found a couple gay AA meetings around me I really hate the idea but clearly I got a little too comfortable.

One day at a time. You got this and yes everybody who knows on here recommends support in the real world. I haven't gone there yet but it seems to be the most recommended approach. I will not drink with you today.
I hope you enjoy the meetings. AA saved my life.
