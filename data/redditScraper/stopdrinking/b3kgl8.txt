Every morning and night i read all yall post. I do it for two reasons. 1 to help each of you with kind words or recomendations. 2  because it helps me realize im not alone in this struggle and know that helps gives me strength on some days when i want to give up. I am on 93 days sober and i will never ever take a sip. Yes the craving are still real and honestly are never going away. But it gets a little easier ever time to not give it. Everyone stay strong and you can do this no matter how many times we relapse. We are all here together. Thank you all.
