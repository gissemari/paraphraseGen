Hey there SD just wanted to share some progress from just over a week sober. A little background: I'm 32m started drinking in college and especially over the past year I had noticed it was consuming my life. I'd end up polishing off a bottle of wine each night at home...Now a week in and it feels like the fog has completely lifted! A few things I've noticed:.* Waking up early naturally! My body clock has woken me up in the 6AM hr every day the past 5 days! I wake up refreshed not dehydrated and without that awful tasting 'fuzzy' mouth. I also don't panic first thing and try to remember what I needed to get done today or what I did last night..* Feeling calmer! I used to feel high-strung most of the time and long for that stress relief at 5 o'clock with glass of wine. Now I see it was the wine that was causing all the stress! According to my fitbit my resting heart rate has decreased 11bpm I feel more confident I listen better without getting agitated and my voice lowered (wtf?).* Friends! Those that I've shared that I'm sober with have opened up a lot to me about their own struggle. We go for walks with my dog and don't need to connect 'over a drink' which was our norm...I will say this though. The first few days are tough I felt bored out of my mind and like I was loosing some part of my life. Now I feel like I've regained all the happiness and potential I had from before I ever started drinking...Thanks for suggesting "This Naked Mind" it really helped convert alcohol from the elixir of life to what it is: a poison...IWNDWYT!

Very inspiring! 
Dogs are the best aren't they? Count yourself lucky you didn't get hit with insomnia right at the beginning. Mine was BRUTAL. I love reading all the positives in your post it's wonderful isn't it?? On a personal note I'm glad to hear about your resting heart rate. Mine's naturally high and it worries me that I won't live as long as I possibly could because my heart's gonna wear out sooner rather than later. Maybe mine will calm down now too :D I just keep reminding myself I was at my peak before I started drinking. There's no reason why I can't feel that way again although it's so hard to imagine while in the throes of addiction cravings. ...Keep up that optimism and IWNDWYT &lt;3
