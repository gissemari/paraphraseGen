I was reading a post on here about social media and how difficult it is seeing other people drinking and having fun so it got me thinking.....**When I first quit drinking I literally thought I would never have fun again.** ..I was 21. Every single one of my friends drank. Everyone did drugs at the weekend (or it seemed like it). I was obsessed with partying and this "image" I'd created in my mind. So even though I quit drinking I still went out to bars and clubs until 3 or 4 even 5am in the morning. RedBulls became my new drink of choice. I genuinely didn't think there was anything wrong with that. ..I simply couldn't imagine a life that didn't involve going out drinking with friends and getting fucked up. ..So if that wasn't going to be with drugs and alcohol at least I'd go out and have "fun" with RedBull. Fast forward 6 months... I'm still sober (miraculously) I'm working AA and the steps I have a sponsor but nothing has really changed. My life is the same as it was before I've just removed alcohol. People in meetings (some in their 40s and 50s) invited me to go on their boat or go for BBQ's at the weekend. I couldn't think of anything worse!! A 21 year old hanging out with a 45 year old on his boat? No escape in sight? We'd have to TALK to each other? God help me!..Of course as one of my favorite sayings goes "If nothing changes nothing changes." After 6 months of sobriety I decided I could use cocaine because alcohol was my real problem. Right? That experiment didn't work too well. I picked up a drink about a month later. And my relapse got worse my binges got longer my drinking and drug use escalated dramatically. I drank and took drugs in the morning before work in the office on the train coming home at the bar in my bedroom at 5 in the morning on worknights... basically anywhere and everywhere I could. ..Finally on April 17th 2016 I'd had enough. I couldn't keep up the charade anymore. The party was over (it had been over for a long long time). I felt a loneliness and despair like I never had before. I cried and asked for help...I haven't had a drink or a drug since that day and my life is now completely different. But I SO remember how hard it was in those early early days. After all this idea of "never having fun again" was one of the main reasons I relapsed in the first place. ..**Tips on how I stayed sober in early sobriety**..One of the greatest gifts sobriety gives us is perspective so looking back on my sobriety so far I can identify the changes I made in my life that got me to where I am today. I'll list them here as they may be helpful to you:..* I stopped going to old "watering holes" completely -- no bars clubs afterwork drinks or anything of the sort..* I dramatically reduced my circle of influence. This meant cutting off some of my best friends completely. For the first six months all I did was hang out with my girlfriend and people from AA. I attribute that decision now as one of the main reasons I'm still sober today...* I accepted that in the short term I would feel bored angry and frustrated. I learned to appreciate the little things like just waking up with a clear head and showering every morning...* Slowly but surely I started finding new ways to fill my time. I went to lots of AA meetings. I explored London with my girlfriend. I went on weekend trips to different cities. I just did whatever I could to keep busy...* I didn't feel great for a while but I just kept hoping and believing that what people told me was true. That life would be fun again. I think that belief is so important...**Some other things worth mentioning quickly...** ..During my first 6 months of sobriety my thinking was a bit "*crazy*." In hindsight I realize that I needed to give my body and mind time to level off. I think that's absolutely crucial. Give yourself a break and realize that the way you feel 3 weeks sober or 3 months sober will be COMPLETELY different when you have a year two years etc. So if going on a hike seems boring as hell now give it time and things WILL change. That's been my experience. ..And that's the irony of this sobriety thing! Now the thought of sitting in a bar for 6 hours or even going to a club seems so boring!!! My lifestyle has completely changed. I can't stress enough how I never thought this would be possible. ...**My new lifestyle**..If you're interested and have made it this far here's some things I incorporate into my lifestyle now that I'm sober to have fun. Remember this is just what works for me for you it could and probably will be completely different. And this list is far from complete but I don't want to waffle on forever.....* I go to the gym 6 days a week and absolutely love it!! .* I love walking and taking in nature .* I love watching the sunrise and sunset.* I love to travel and go on new adventures with my girlfriend (we're moving to Melbourne Australia in a month!).* I challenged myself at work and now find myself enjoying it instead of struggling to stay awake.* I go out to restaurants and eat good food.* Recently I've gotten into meditation and it's been amazing so far.* I have real conversations with real people who actually care about me.* I enjoy reading (something I never did when I drank).* I started writing a book.* I eat super healthy and actually enjoy it.* ...the list is endless really!..So apologies for the essay but my main point is really this: during early sobriety we have very little (sometimes zero) perspective on our life. We need to give ourselves time and space to grow and become "normal" again. We have to realize that if we don't change who we hang out with and where we hang out it could lead to relapse. My experience shows that. Remember: if nothing changes nothing changes...And most importantly life is insanely fun when sober!! This coming from a 23 year old guy who literally could not imagine a life (let alone a fun one) without drugs and alcohol...All we have is this moment. Today. Anyone can quit drinking for one day. And that's all I do. And I enjoy myself while I'm at it!! ..Who's next?

You are half my age a one great beautiful inspiration !!! Plus I have  a 25 year old son that seems to think life without drugs and alcohol isn't life at all . You are a perfect example of the lie that is !!! So happy for you!!!'
Great post!  Thanks for sharing!  
I you are spot on with everything in your post. I also got sober at 21 and it took awhile to change my perspective of fun. The decade of my 20's turned out to be the funnest most productive and amazing time of self discovery. Honestly it never really has stopped. I still have so much more things I want to learn and do. Keep rocking sobriety OP
