It's been about month since I felt a real desire to drink and have not drank at home or alone since November. I did have half a glass of wine at a wedding and two glasses of wine on a date a few weeks ago but honestly my desire to continue drinking (something I usually struggle with) didn't extend past that. I feel like I might actually be at a place where I can totally stop drinking. I've been feeling generally amazing my sleep has been awesome mood improved and skin is all glow-y. I want to be sober 24/7 but I'm almost afraid that if I make it "official" it will become a struggle again. In the past I've had a hard time with staying sober and I am almost afraid if I label it and start counting days going to meetings etc my mind will suddenly see it as more of a struggle and the desire will return.  ..&amp;#x200B;..Am I a weirdo for having this fear? Any advice? I'm so excited by the idea that I could actually achieve sobriety and I would feel heartbroken if I lost this positive momentum.

I see personal struggles on here that are damn disheartening but everyone is different. I feel really bad for those that struggle after four days of not drinking. I really do. But I can't say I relate. I drank almost every day for decades. Most nights all the way through to blackout. Over 3 decades of that to be honest. But when I quit drinking I quit drinking. I did the same thing with cigarettes 15 years ago. Just up and quit after a pack a day for 20 years. Never wanted a cigarette since. I really don't know why I keep a counter on here I'm done. My father quit exactly the same way around the exact same time in his life   both cigarettes &amp; alcohol. Maybe you're just done too.
Whatever works for you is the right way! It doesn't matter what you call it if you don't drink tomorrow and then you don't drink the day after it and then you keep doing that you get what you want. No need to be stuck on semantics or "forever".
