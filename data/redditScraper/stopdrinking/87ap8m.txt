Hello everyone this is my first time posting. ..Im 19 and I recently just came back to my family home from a year  of recovering from my alcoholism . I left home and left university to stop drinking as it was going to kill me to be honest. Before I left for university I was really struggling with staying sober and I did something bad that's now affecting me back at home. ..my family lives with in my grandparents house. They live in a annex next door and never speak with us and rarely come into the house to say hello. They have a wine rack in the living room that had 30-40 bottles. When I was 18 I couldnt sleep without getting black out drunk. I was fighting with my family everyday and had just gotten out of a relationship that was keeping me stable which I now know is just bollocks. I took 1 of their bottles and drank it all in one night and before I knew it I was taking more and more. I stopped at the tenth one It was killing me inside that I had no shame. ..Sooner or later I get a call from my family saying they found out and that they tried to get the police involved. I was so scared and afraid that I would have some kind of record that would stop me from getting anywhere in life so I shut down and couldn't communicate with anyone anymore. ..Ive been sober since Jan 2nd 2017 and I am back at my family home applying for jobs and getting ready for university again  and I want to apologize but I am honestly very scared.. very scared that they would be angry enough to call the authorities again. They are white and are very uncomfortable around me. I am biracial and queer and they are very strict and conservative. I asked my father If I could apologize to them because the stress and guilt has been eating at me ever since but he told me that they will not change how they feel about my past behaviour so I think he is implying that they remember and just allow me to exist in the house but with  a grudge. ..Does anyone know how I may find the courage to face my fear of my conservative grandparents and accept any action they may take?

Are you in AA? If so I would consult your sponsor. I'm sure your dad has good intentions and he may be right. There may be ways to relieve your guilt without making direct amends...It's hard to say without knowing more about your situation. But if it were me I would probably plan to pay them back the money - calculate how much the 10 bottles cost and find a way to give it to them whether you end up telling them what it's for or not. ..Even if it doesn't change how they think about you it might change how you feel about yourself. Shame can drive us to drink again...Good luck x
One good piece of advice I received is that my acts of apologizing and trying to forgive are for ME not anybody else.  It is up to other people to do with those messages as they want.  True remorse and apologies and amends are STILL doing the right thing even if they aren't immediately accepted.  I'd agree with the above comment and consult your sponsor if you have one but it sounds like getting those things off your chest to them honestly and earnestly might help you feel better.  And who knows?  I've heard so many times in AA meetings how surprised people were with reactions to their amends for past mistakes.  Just yesterday I finally told my only close friend at work (also where I live) and drinking buddy that I'm an alcoholic and I can't (CAN'T) drink any more.  I was so scared to let her down yet she didn't even flinch...I've also had people from my past that have never allowed me to apologize for my past behavior.  To not even be heard is truly hard but the best (if not only) response to that is doing all I can to try and live a truly better life for the next time they see me if they ever do at all.  So I'm here online with all of you who are trying to do the same because I haven't quite gotten it yet.  In that spirit I will not drink with you today.
