Hello!..18 days ago I quit smoking weed (pretty heavy user) and the effects upon my mood and memory have been incredibly positive. I've promised myself that I won't smoke again until I take the Law School Admissions Test in summer of 2019. This test is an absolute beast and requires a disciplined study routine for any hope of achieving a nominally good score. It's going to have a greater effect upon my future than any other thing I've done in the last 5 years. So time to put away childish things and get cracking. ..I've never considered myself anywhere near alcoholism in my 28 years. I'll go out and drink heavily on occasion but it never leads me to any ill effects besides a hangover and loss of sleep/money. I like to have a few beers at the end of the day to unwind and watch TV or play video games but I can just as easily do without them. Weed has always been by far my greatest vice. Unless you count masturbating. ..Anyway my newfound quasi-sobriety got me thinking: why not cut the booze also? I remember the study that was posted on reddit a while ago (I'm sure one of you can link to it) showing a link between poor memory and moderate alcohol consumption. So if I'm gonna put the LSAT first and foremost then I might as well go full throttle on this. It'll be interesting to see what the effects will be if I quit for such an extended period something that I haven't done since I turned 21. Other motivating factors:..\-Getting into better shape. I'm a chronic under eater who filled in a lot of his missing calories with a few beers at the end of the day. Now I'll be forced to fill the gap with nutritious food...\-Working on my social anxiety. It's something that I've struggled with for my entire life but I feel like I've made some strides in a positive direction recently. Drinking has always appealed to me as a way to forget my nervousness in social settings but sobriety will allow me to face my problems more directly rather than putting a temporary band-aid over the wound. ..\-Meet people whose lives don't revolve around alcohol or weed. I love my friends but a lot of them are heavy users of both alcohol and weed (or psychedelics in the case of this weird dude who went to alcoholics anonymous and now takes mushrooms like every day). I don't want to replace them but I could definitely use some different perspectives in my life. ..\-Money money money. I work a shitty job right now and I don't have much discretionary income. ..\-Stomach issues. Honestly a lot of these have gone away once I quit smoking weed. But I still have a delicate tummy and I think it would be helpful for my digestion...Well that's my first ever post on /r/stopdrinking. I'd love to hear from anyone who quit for a similar reason or simply noticed improvements in their cognitive functions after teetotaling. This is day 2 no alx btw :P

Well that's brilliant news you're trying quitting both!  You may be surprised how much even moderate drinking can effect your stomach and appetite.  I ate late to help the alcohol go down easier and to help the effect kick in quicker.   I am on day 21 today and already my raging heartburn has all but gone.  ..I didn't drink every day due to working 24 hr shifts but probably drank 6/7 pints when off work.  I would go to work with a cloudy head and I've even been embarrassed when I've told my boss the same story that I told him the night before whist drinking over the phone.  I could not remember the conversation.  So you're right to suggest your studies will be effected if you don't stop both.  ..Even though you can take or leave alcohol like I once could sounds like you've got quite an addictive personality.  You may find yourself substituting the cannabis for more drink that may creep up on you and take control of you.  (I had even started drinking a beer on the way home from work in the car couldn't wait 20 minutes before I got home!)...I have said this to other people who post on this site so sorry for repeating myself but a gent gave me some advise who was a chronic alcoholic.  He asked which floor do I want to get off on.  Near the top where I'm in control or down  at the bottom in the basement where I have no control and needing the intervention of others having lost everything.  This may be an AA line he attends meetings.  Some people are not too positive about AA but hey I'll take advise wherever it's source comes from if it helps me to stop...Sounds like you're a pretty switched on person to me.  Life without a drug in any form is doable!  Your social awkwardness will probably reduce as you see those that are drinking or smoking around you behaving in pretty stupid way.  ...Hope you make it through the next eight months.  I hope your sobriety helps you find a new clarity of mind and I hope your studies go well!     .
I think quitting weed will have a bigger positive impact on your LSAT score than quitting alcohol but quitting both is a great idea...&amp;#x200B;..Good luck on the test.  I took it at age 40 and did ok.  It was like the SAT minus the math but plus a ton of super annoying questions like: ..\---------------..Alice is a vegetarian.  Bob and Cindy both eat the same kind of food.  Daniel is an omnivore on even numbered days and doesn't eat meat on odd numbered days.  Esther eats whatever her lunch mates are eating on any given day unless it's Wednesday...&amp;#x200B;..If Cindy goes out to eat on Thursday with Alice and Daniel and brings back a lunch for one of her office mates will Esther finally tell Bob that everyone can see him picking his nose at his desk and to please stop?..\-------------
