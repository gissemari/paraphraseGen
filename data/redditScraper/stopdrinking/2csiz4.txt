I will not drink today...Aside from my issue with alcohol I think these posts are one of the things that show that I can be a very ritualistic person. I have always known that about myself in the way I drank but I am starting to notice it in other things that I do. Some people might think that is a bad thing but I am quite the opposite. I like the routine and normalcy. Maybe it is from the last 6 years of the exact opposite. ..Regardless these posts have been absolutely crucial to my sobriety. Accountability routine and some time to reflect and just BLAH words out there. If you're struggling contemplate making some posts and just throwing some thoughts out there. I think you will be surprised how much it can help...Wednesday ROCKS! Sober for today.

Good work on the regimen. Get this ingrained and you will have the drinking "on-off" switch "off."  
At one point I thought poorly of routines regimens etc. I thought of them as constrictive and limiting. I realized later that the self-discipline I learned in establishing those routines is what gave me freedom.
