An interesting article on the Sinclair Method:..[https://www.centersite.net/poc/view\_doc.php?type=doc&amp;id=11132&amp;cn=14](https://www.centersite.net/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&amp;id=11132&amp;cn=14)..Podcast mentioned in article:..[http://www.shrinkrapradio.com/images/64-The-Sinclair-Method-for-Treating-Addiction.mp3](http://www.shrinkrapradio.com/images/64-The-Sinclair-Method-for-Treating-Addiction.mp3)..\-----..For a deeper more scientific dive:..[https://smjournals.com/ebooks/drug-abuse-treatment/chapters/DAT-16-02.pdf](https://smjournals.com/ebooks/drug-abuse-treatment/chapters/DAT-16-02.pdf)..\-----..**Quote from first link:**..Wikipedia (which produces democratic but not always expert or entirely factually correct articles) [has this to say](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_Method):..&gt;"Dissemination of information of the treatment has been blocked by all of the existing treatment organizations largely because their existence depends upon the continued use of the treatments that they provide. The "give 'em a pill and send 'em home" simplicity of the system is anathema to our current alcoholism treatment industry. Most treatment centers rely upon inpatient treatment for funding and would cease to exist if widespread adoption were to occur. Alcoholics Anonymous opposes the treatment on two fronts - the use of drugs and the continuation of drinking...  .&gt;  .&gt;  .The medical community has been largely unconvinced of the effectiveness of this cure because of the extreme shift in mindset necessary to accept a treatment for alcoholism that involves continued consumption. To further cloud the matter many studies have been done involving using naltrexone to help enforce abstinence - a purpose for which it is poorly suited at best. Although their "failure due to relapse rate" has no bearing on the Sinclair Method most doctors see a "this drug failed" result and don't look to see how it was used....  .&gt;  .&gt;  .Other obstacles are more mysterious and tentative. It is guessed that the pharmaceutical company that makes the antagonist does not wish to pursue advertising this treatment because its use would decrease the sales of other more profitable drugs. Although insurance companies would benefit from the decrease in inpatient alcoholism treatments it is suggested that they would lose money in the long run from former alcoholics who no longer let their health slide until they lose their jobs and their insurance."
----------immediate responses--------

I have no experience with the method personally but my sister has used naltrexone to cut back on drinking and I can't report that it did much for her. She still has the same mental anguish as before. For me I found healing my body and mind only happened when I decided to try being a non-drinker
I'm not familiar with the method but I'm very skeptical of anyone who says shit akin to big pharma and the gov'ment suppressing the valuable information they have. A bit too woo woo for my tastes and in line with  alternative  medicine. ..I'm not saying some folks don't find success in sobriety with this method but it has a lot of very practical flaws from my perspective. It does nothing to address the underlying cause of alcoholism mentally. It relies on an alcoholic to take medication for the rest of their drinking careers that actively stops them from receiving the high that comes from drinking (not likely sustainable for most alcoholics) and the introduction of even more substances in the body that will have major negative consequences if not used exactly as directed (and perhaps even if they are). ..I'm fine with roughing out sobriety sans more substances.
