I am on day 11 or 12. My body feels good no pains like before when I was drinking. I quit smoking too but I am holding on by a thread day by day. I can't believe I keep making it another day. I am just trying to hold on by my finger tips until I get enough days behind me to make the cravings go down...Wish you the best of luck in your struggles and adversities. Only thing that is keeping me going is a better future. I want to be able to enjoy the present but right now I'm living for tomorrow.

Congrats mate You can beat this!

Way to go! I can't speak to the smoking side of things but I imagine kicking both at once is no joke... alcohol alone is no joke!..On the drinking side it keeps getting easier! Take care of yourself and keep yourself busy.
Congrats!!
