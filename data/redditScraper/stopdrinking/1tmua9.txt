I know it may be a day early for some of our northern friends but it's 9am Christmas morning here and I just wanted to say this:..It has been an amazing privilege to have been involved with such a caring honest and supportive environment as this subreddit. You all inspire me daily - I rejoice in your triumphs I struggle in your trials...Last Christmas I was alone in my room getting drunk and crying because of the pain I felt and the fact that despite running to the bottle for comfort I felt no comfort at all. This year I am just over seven weeks sober and powering on. With your inspiration and support I have turned a horrible drinking problem into daily exercise and healthy eating a complete turn around. There are still very difficult days but they are becoming easier...I am so proud of you all. You all show the extraordinary character in wanting to change your lives in fighting your demons. You will succeed and I will be there cheering you on as you do!..Happy holidays merry Christmas happy Hanukkah whatever way you celebrate the festive season. Have a good day keep fighting the good fight...I'm going for a bike ride it's a beautiful day outside :)
