Hi there I hope this post is okay I'm not sure where to begin. I'm trying to help my mom. She is an alcoholic and prescription drug abuser (opioids) has had multiple arrests/DUIs and has put all of her relationships in jeopardy. We have given her multiple second chances and have been as supportive as we can but it's evident she can't get well on her own. To put it simply she desperately needs rehab and for the first time in her life is willing to go. At this point we think that residential rehab would be best for her she's done something similar to outpatient rehab (it was like a church program) and she ended up relapsing. We live paycheck to paycheck and are desperate for any advice on how to afford this. We live in the bay area california. She has insurance (Sutter Health) but we tried getting her admitted into one place and they quoted us with a huge copay or something. (I'm super ignorant to how insurance works but from what I understand we would still have to pay thousands of dollars which we can't afford). If anyone has any personal recommendations for places that offer affordable care/payment plans or charities/organizations that can help I would really appreciate it.

Hi. I'm sorry your family is having a rough time. It's good of you to be helping out...This sub really isn't the best place for this post. You might want to reach out to r/AlAnon. It's a group of people who love an alcoholic but do not want the other person's drinking to negatively affect their lives. Or if 12-step isn't your bag you might try r/scienceandkindness. It's another great sub for loved ones dealing with someone else's addiction issues where they focus on the [CRAFT]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_reinforcement_approach_and_family_training) method.
