I'm really struggling not to even a day now without drinking after work. The past couple of weeks I've manged 6-9 tall cans a night. I'm drinking to cope with the stress of my job. ..I just need a little daily encouragement and someone I could message after reading this sub to get me going...I'm a 32yo male work in construction and live in Canada for a little context...Thanks guys my goal is today then tomorrow then one week...Cheers I mean IWNDWYT!

I'll try to be your accountability partner.  I could use one too.  I will try to message you every day if you would like.  We can try to keep each other on the straight and narrow.  Let me know.  IWNDWYT.
