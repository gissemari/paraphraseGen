(badge reset pending)..Just needed to connect with some folks who've been here and still made it. At the moment I can't even figure out how or why I fell back in it's all so illogical. I feel like I poisoned myself last night and you know what? I totally did! wtf. .. I've decreased my drinking so much this year and I am proud of that. 30 days here 60 days there generally only having a drink or two when I slip but also completely wrecking myself a few times. Why can't I seem to manage that last step and cut it out completely/stop this relapsing cycle?..Watching ted talks on addiction today and renewing my focus. Not drinking with all of you today.

It's ok slip ups are bound to happen in this process. Most importantly you are back on the horse and will get back those days in no time. ..Also the days you did accumulate are not wasted either. I'm on day 11. I will not drink with you today. 
Thank you for having the courage to come back immediately friend. You're here now and you have renewed resolve. I don't think there's anything more anyone could ask from you right now. 
I think just the fact that you almost immediately go back to being sober after slipping is already an achievement. Most people would just give up on giving up so it shows your head is in the right space. Just keep doing your best and don't beat yourself up about what's already happened. 
Not drinking with you!..I finally realized that it wasn't *lack of willpower* as my issue but rather *Lack of In Real Life Support*.  That's all I needed!..I went to meetings and immediately found people who understood what I was experiencing.  I got tools resources support and fellowship to first stop drinking and then to live sober...Now I just forgo ONE drink today - The First One..Never been happier!
