Hey brother. Back in college I was blacking out every night for 2 years and the next day I would feel great until time to drink the next night and I didn't understand it until yesterday actually. Since I "quit" drinking every night years ago I've been tapering off and mostly sober drinking less than once a month or less than one week a month but it has always still been too much. I black out when I drink on purpose. I learned what I hope is the most important bit of quitting drinking for me... "Several studies suggest that mu and delta opioid receptors play a major role in ethanol reinforcement and dependence." My parents were both junkies and I was born addicted thanks to my mom using while I was in the womb. I am highly intelligent otherwise healthy and successful but I have been a lifelong addict. I don't think I can cure my addiction and if anyone wants to point me in the right direction on that please link me. I am looking at psychedelic therapy. I have not been to doctors or therapists in my life. I have talked to some therapists online and studied so much trying to figure out what is wrong with my mind and heart. Here's my timeline and list of addictions...Birth \- heroin..Child \- video games..Adolescent \- video games and food..Young adult \- video games food women..Wreck during young adulthood \- opioids \(prescribed to me and turned me on to drugs replaced my Tramadol prescription with alcohol shortly after never understood until recently what went so wrong in young adulthood\) but I didn't know much about addiction at the time..Coming into adulthood \- success getting healthy \(losing weight\) alcohol blacking out 2 years every night drunk..Manic alcohol induced mental breakdown \- bad wreck my fault blacked out the night before the wreck quit drinking so much new women heavily back into video game addiction \(made money at it this time\) reigned it in to less than once a week..2013 until now \- don't drink frequently but do drink excessively going to stop drinking right now because all my life I never wanted to be a heroin junkie like my father and I have been an addicted junkie through other things but the worst was alcohol..Looking forward \- I want to continue my addiction to success and video games pick up a creative hobby hopefully learn to make music like my favorite artist who took his life recently by cutting his wrists with a broken liquor bottle..Crying as I write this because this weekend I hit rock bottom. I've been hurting so much since Avicii died and my girlfriend showed me unconditional love isn't really. Life is suffering. Death is rest. You have to find something that makes the suffering worthwhile. For me I hope I can build on my healthy addictions and stop using alcohol...I would trade my life to have Avicii back for this world. I hope his music has saved me from alcohol. It's going to be a tough road to walk alone Tim. I wish I could have talked to you even though I never knew you...tldr; I love you guys. The biggest problem I am struggling with is that love isn't real but I can hear it in music even if I can't feel it from my family or my girlfriend. Maybe one day I'll understand it. I will not drink with you today.

I know that we are supposed to speak from the   I' on this subreddit but I'm not sure if I can get this point across while doing so...Love is real. It's fleeting and sometimes it's painful but I honestly believe that it's real. People  have committed crimes shed tears and moved mountains for it so I want to believe whole heartedly that it's real...If you're not getting it from your partner don't worry about it. You're getting it from an internet stranger right now...The most important kind of love that exists is the love you show yourself... 
The first thing to realize here is that these harmful addictions of yours aren't your fault. Addictions can be extremely powerful and backed up by external influences like your mother's drinking habits when you were still in the womb. Your struggle to give up drinking isn't a failure of your willpower because your brain has probably been wired to take in a lot of alcohol to reach that carefree state. This can also fuel addictions to other things like electronics food sex etc. like you mentioned. What matters now is recovery and it's definitely possible. You've already taken the first step by reaching out to others here and talking to therapists as well as finding healthier distractions from the stress from life like music. It sucks that Avicii is gone especially for his fans :\( But his method of dealing with the pain is NEVER the answer because it horribly wounds the people around. ..Sure this world has plenty of negative influences and fake individuals who will talk to you for their own personal gain and you need to be aware of these jerks but also don't forget about the people who actually do care about you. There has to be good people in your life you haven't mentioned and there had to have been times when you successfully coped with life's problems in a healthy way. Have you tried focusing on hobbies in a healthy quantity along with listening to music? ..Thanks for opening up brother it must've been tough to write about your life up until now and I think it's great that you can open up to others. You're not alone man I've had blackouts and regretted my actions after a night of drinking as well and quitting completely is a tough road especially when life gives you a hard time in other areas as well. I believe in you though and I know you can pull through.
