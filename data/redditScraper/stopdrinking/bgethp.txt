Happy Tuesday! ..I have finished *Infinite Jest* and am processing it. There are a lot of great passages about the inner lives of substance abusers of all kinds and about the painful truths of sobriety. I'll just lay a couple of them on you found in different parts of the book:.. After so long not caring and then now the caring crashes back in and turns so easily into obsessive worry in sobriety ... One of the highest prices of sobriety was not being able to keep from remembering things you didn't want to remember.  ..I think these are things most of us here at SD are working on. It's so hard to fine tune the brain to remember just enough to keep us from repeating our mistakes but not so much as to torment us. To face our problems instead of running from them but to be able to relax enough to get the rest that our bodies and minds need. We face some pretty damn tough challenges in our lives. But the rewards are so great. Here's what DFW says in IJ about people with decades of sobriety who he refers to as Crocodiles: .. The Crocodiles decades sober live in a totally different spiritual galaxy inside. One long-timer describes it as he has a whole new unique interior spiritual castle now to live in.  That sounds pretty great to me and like the struggle is going to be so worth it. ..What are you reading/watching/listening to?

I am closing in on the end of **Infinite Jest** and I am reading a collection of short stories by NK Jemesin called **How long 'Til Black Future Month?** it is a great bunch of stories.....As for TV I am watching **Game Of Thrones**... and listening to Game of Thrones podcasts and watching Game of Thrones breakdown videos and searching Game of Thrones forums... yes I am obsessed. lol
I just flew from Tampa to San Francisco and on the plane I read *The Second Chance Dog* by Jon Katz. I love Jon Katz's work -- he has a farm in the Adirondacks with working dogs and he refuses to sentimentalize or anthropomorphize his dogs. But the book is really about him finding love in middle age with a woman who was an artist at heart but had stopped making her art. I greatly enjoyed it.
I have so many books on my night stand that I'm reading right now. Hubris Utopia for Realists Hitchhiker's Guide to Galaxy (reread) but the one I'm happiness about is Alcohol Explained. I'm simply devouring it. Touchy feely memoirs of getting sober don't do it for me. Science? Undeniable fact? Statistics? Yep. I'm in it.
Plugging away on Harry Potter.  He found a magical map that shows secret passages to Hogsmeade and also locations of Dumbledore and others.  Harry is going back and forth (ahem rationalizing) about if he should or shouldn't go to Hogsmeade.  He reasons that he's not going to do anything bad.  It's not like he's going to steal anything...   ..Yup.  Knowing damn well shouldn't be going out but justifying it because well yah know...
I started reading Bourdain's Kitchen Confedntial today. 60 pages in and it's filled with alcohol and various other substance abuses but I knew it'd be like that. I've worked in the hospitality industry and have experienced more than a couple of similar situations as the ones Bourdain describes. Thankfully reading about it doesn't produce any kind of triggers so I can enjoy it fully...It's also way funnier than I expected.
I'm reading This Naked Mind familiar book to many of you here. Any recommendations after this?  ..IWNDWYT
I'm reading 'The Moral Animal' by Robert Wright. He uses evolutionary psychology to explain our social relationships some of our more base urges and sexual behaviors. It helped me understand how it's so easy to get addicted to stuff that feels good. Highly recommend.
Currently reading *This Naked Mind* (taking it slow it's heavy for me). As well *Daring Greatly*...Just finished *The Power of Habit* *Meditation For Fidgety Skeptics* and *The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F%#k* (incredible)...Started watching *True Detective* finally I'm loving the writing although fair warning there are definitely some triggers. I don't think I would've been comfortable watching it in my first month.
Hey Belinda just wanted to say hi and thank you for hosting this awesome thread...I found so many books helpful - this is a beautiful service that you're providing to our loving community...thank you &lt;3.
I just finished reading Granite Mountain. It was amazing and way more in depth than the movie.
I finished both The Secret History by Donna Tartt and Nightmare Alley by William Lindsay Gresham in the course of one weekend and I thought they were both brilliant but uh I definitely don't recommend those books if you're trying to think about not drinking - heavy themes of alcoholism and alcohol abuse in both novels. It was a real struggle to finish one of them while still hungover.
Infinite Jest and the life plateaus is a concept I have been contemplating constantly lately! The getting sober plateau is the first one... Then there is so much there. I feel comfortably alcohol free but soon realize sobriety has so so many more stages...
Reading: This Naked Mind. I'm also trying to force myself to read LOTR big fan of the films and the influence it's had on fantasy but jeez Louise are those first few hundred pages of Fellowship boring.....Watching: Jojos Bizzare Adventure Part 5...and I Love New York. Don't judge me dammit I know it's trash but it's MY trash
I don't know if anyone else is watching the Fosse/Verdon series on the FX channel (in the US) but it's very impressive. Michelle Williams and Sam Rockwell are amazing. In the book department I just finished Marc Maron's Attempting Normal. He doesn't talk a whole lot about his sobriety (I think he's at 20 years now) but parts of it are literally laugh-out-loud funny.
I'm reading *In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts: Close Encounters with Addiction.* I intellectualize absolutely everything and sobriety is no exception so I'm eating up this fairly academic book. The first third or so consists of tragic stories of addicted people the author treated in the grittiest corners of Vancouver. The second third is getting to the meat of addiction research...His basic overview is compelling. "Addiction is a complex condition a complex interaction between human beings and their environment. . . Addiction has biological chemical neurological psychological medical emotional social political economic and spiritual underpinnings- and perhaps others I haven't thought about. To get anywhere near a complete picture we must keep shaking the kaleidoscope to see what other patterns emerge."
"Flaked"   TV show    https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4973548/..About a local AA guru.  It suffers from only having about 10% at most the accuracy of Mom and was probably written by people who had a brother or sister in the program.  But required viewing for those who want to claim to have seen all programs that dealt with addiction.  Main character's name is Chip.
