I was 70 or so days sober. I drank on Thanksgiving.im in a relationship with a man who has been sober 5 years in January. I'm living out of my skin. I've isolated myself in drinking and Sobriety. I struggle to find a sponser Bec I have huge issues with trusting women. And it sucks. I don't know where it stemmed from but I do. I want to be close to people in general but I have huge trust issues. Here it goes again. Adobe would be awesome

welcome back :) it's awesome you can bounce back so quickly. .don't know much about AA - do you have to have a female sponsor? 
I'm resetting my badge as well. You're not alone. I don't have much advice as I'm kinda in the same boat and working through stuff but just wanted to let you know that I'm willing to add some days to our badges with you. One day at a time...Holidays are risky times as it seems you found over Thanksgiving. If I had to offer any advice to yourself (and myself for that matter) is to stay on your toes as Xmas is coming up quickly - think about what happened over Thanksgiving and what steps you can take to avoid a repeat over the winter holidays...Good luck and I won't be drinking with you today! Feel free to reach out if you need to talk (I am a guy however).
