I had 6 months sober and relapsed at the end of July. Been drinking since then. My life is unmanageable. I'm ready to do this again. Drove right past the liquor store today where I would usually get two bottles of wine and start drinking immediately. Here's to day 1 and I will not drink with you today or tonight!

If you don't mind me asking since relapse is a huge fear of mine were you able to identify why your relapse happened in July? Do you know what you want to do different moving forward? Relapse is my greatest fear so I'm always trying to build my defense up! Happy New Year!
On day 1 with you! IWNDWYT 
I had a similar experience. Five months and relapsed in June. Spent 3 months tearing myself apart drinking. I got sober again in September. 100 something days strong now. You had 6 months so you know how to do it. Stay strong. I will not drink with you today! 
Here for your day   ! Keep being brave you can do this! IWNDWYT 
Driving past the liquor store was a victory! Here's to many more
I feel much better this time I am on Naltrexone and Campryl and that seems to have helped my cravings and AA and a therapist to deal with my mental issues. Honestly the journaling has been the missing piece for me it helps me pull all the sobriety stuff together with my thoughts. This may sound crude so I apologize in advance but it is like taking a huge mental shit each evening when I write and it has been tremendously helpful. I need to add more exercise in my program but I'm just happy being sober because it seemed impossible at first. I couldn't see my life without alcohol and I am slowly building life without it one day at a time. How are you doing how long has it been since your last relapse? 
Nice work. Im just a few days in and anxious as all hell. You did it before and you can again.
