Girlfriend dumped me last night immediately relapsed. I didn't even give myself a chance to think I had made my mind up within a millisecond that I was going to drink and didn't let that thought go until it happened...Made it 141 days and felt fantastic. New job healthier supporting girlfriend who also didn't drink and threw it all away because getting dumped is by far my least favorite feeling. Having the willpower to not drink is so much easier for me when I don't feel alone. And I don't mean support from friends and y'all isn't great...just a different kind of support. Feeling dirty today.

Stand back up and dust yourself off.  Don't feel as if you have failed.  That check has been cashed (night of drinking)move forward.  Everything will work out.  Remember that you have to take care of yourself.
Straight up honest! That's a good start. I once threw away 4+ yrs and it took me 12+ yrs to return so yu are doing much better than me. I will not drink with you today.
If I'm remembering you correctly... I think you had a lot of trouble getting the first few days under your belt for a while and then eventually went to rehab? ..What's your plan to avoid falling back into that same cycle again?
Man I'm sorry.  Getting dumped hurts like a bitch.
