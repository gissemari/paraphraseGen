Hi!..I just did the maths   I'd lost track of time!   I quit at the start of 2012 when it became apparent that I had a serious problem with drinking and apart from one Glastonbury mega binge mistake in 2013 I've not touched a drop since.  ..Every day is difficult & I still find myself thinking about drinking and taking drugs. I've lost friends and I don't have much of a social life as I try not to put myself in situations where I might be tempted.. I've just missed Glastonbury for a second year as I KNEW that I would not be able to resist.   It has to be this way though..  ..I can't recommend running enough to anyone looking to stop drinking and taking drugs it's done so much for me.  I've got myself into really good physical condition and will be running a marathon in a couple of months. I feel like even though I'm tempted to drink I don't want to harm my body as I've worked so hard to make it healthy. ...So I'm still coming to terms with who I am now & for a long time I have felt joyless. This has improved in the last year or so but I still struggle socially without a bottle to hide behind. I've not had a partner since quitting but feel like I'm probably ready now... I caused so many people pain when I was drinking. For a long time I felt like I didn't want to inflict myself on somebody else.  I still do actually....Anyway I lurk on this page for support (thanks) but never post usually.  I just wanted to tell anyone struggling right now that you **CAN** do it however hard it seems at the moment.  .

&gt; Every day is difficult &amp; I still find myself thinking about drinking and taking drugs. I've lost friends and I don't have much of a social life as I try not to put myself in situations where I might be tempted..It shouldn't be that difficult at this stage.  I haven't felt the way you're describing for over two years.  You can do it too.  "If it's not impossible then there must be a way to do it."  ;)..Congrats.
&gt;I can't recommend running enough to anyone looking to stop drinking and taking drugs..Yup! This has helped me tremendously as well. I wish more people would give it a shot. I noticed in a relatively short amount of time how much it was helping. 
Congratulations /u/Hollow_Ponds -- an invite to join us on /r/dinos will shortly follow unless one of the other DINO mods beat me to it.
