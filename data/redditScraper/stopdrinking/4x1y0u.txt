Had first drink dream. Went through the struggle and did not succumb. Woke up and was grateful it was a dream. Practice for the awake world.

Well done I have them all the time. Still not used to them. 
I may have had a dream I am not sure. My dream life has been pretty quiet since I've stopped drinking. I do recall some dreams but don't recall them being good or bad. I think my brain is much more relaxed now that I've stopped drinking. Perhaps in the near future these dreams may come up but at the moment in peace thankfully.
I wrote the post: [What do drinking dreams mean?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2dit1m/what_do_drinking_dreams_mean/) after exchanging emails with leading dream researchers.  You might find it interesting.
It's terrifying for me . I have these periodically  they feel so real and I am overcome with relief when I wake up and realize it was just a dream; however still throughout the day; the terror of the relapse resonates a bit .  Talk to your Sponser about it. Talk to friends in sobriety about it.  Post here about it like you did.   :)
It's like a feeling of victory when we realize it was only a dream :).
I just started having drinking dreams. I have always had really vivid dreams that are like watching a movie. Had a really vivid one last week. I was invited to a fancy dinner in like a palace in Russia (weird idk). There was this fancy Russian champagne and I couldn't not have some it would be rude to refuse. Then it spiraled into me partying and drinking like all the champagne I could taste and feel the bubbles. Then suddenly like my brain knew this was wrong I in the dream said wait I don't drink anymore everything rewound it was all in my dream selves head and I turned down the champagne and we went on with dinner it was no big deal. I still woke up with the taste of champagne on my tongue and had to look around to make sure I was sober. Once I realized I was sober I smiled and want to high five my dream self.
