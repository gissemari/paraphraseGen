Every March I participate in a big volunteer conference for an organization I'm involved with. This organization while volunteer based has a pretty well-known reputation for its members letting loose having fun and getting drunk at these conferences because hey we only see each other a few times a year we're celebrating the community work we've done and someone always brings too many jello shooters....Last year it started with me sneaking Baileys in my coffee. Looks like cream no one could tell the difference. I wasn't the only person doing it anyway so I pretended like it wasn't a problem with me and my drinking (even know I knew it was a problem I just didn't care). By the time the meetings were finished that afternoon I was already a little bit slurry. After dinner came the shots. Jager Fireball you name it I drank it. I remember throwing up and then ordering a Polar Bear so my breath would smell fresh. Yeah I was that girl. I was pounding back beer dancing up a storm and don't remember getting home. I vaguely remember someone walking me to my front door and my (now ex) getting me in the house. I woke up 12 hours later with no pants on in my ex's bed and no idea how that happened (my ex and I were already sleeping in separate rooms by that point with limited physical contact)....I was embarrassed but nothing I couldn't shrug off and laugh about with the same people that were feeding me shots all night. These actions continued at the State conference and National conference the same year. Though for those ones I prided myself on only having one black out night each of those weekends. Again waking up in unfamiliar beds. Feeling empty. Yet I still wouldn't tell myself I had a problem....I have been sober almost a month now. The decision actually kinda came out of nowhere. There wasn't a 'moment of clarity' or a defining event that helped me make this decision. I just didn't have a drink one day. Or the next. I was tired of it. Then 3 days later by some miracle I had medication I had to take for a week that meant I could not consume alcohol. It was the longest I had gone without alcohol since...2012? Too long. I felt like crap. My head was foggy I couldn't sleep or eat my body was antsy. But one day a couple of weeks ago I woke up and I felt...bright. It's the only word I can use to describe how I've been feeling. I just feel brighter. My eyes aren't glassy my face isn't red I wake up alone in my own bed with a clear recollection of my night before. No bottles hidden in my dresser my purse or my linen closet....This past weekend was the conference and I was on the chairing committee. The other chairs had jello shots before the meeting was even called to order. i sipped my coffee. By lunch everyone was having a beer or other drink and I had moved onto club soda. By supper people were getting a bit tipsy and sloppy. I was on club soda number 5 (maybe not the best choice but I wanted something fizzy). When the night was over one of my girlfriend's was puking in a bush people were all over each other stumbling and laughing that obnoxious high-pitched drunk laughter that I know I used to be so guilty of. Everyone was trying to get back to the hotel- waiting for shuttle buses ordering cabs and ubers and some stupid people trying to figure out if they could drive or not. I grabbed my keys hopped in my car and drove a few of the (less drunk) members to the hotel for the rest of the party. Then I went home and got some rest. Running the conference was a lot of work and because I was the only sober member on the committee I ended up pretty much running the show and making myself look really good in the eyes of some of the higher-ups and received some really nice compliments on it....One of the ladies that helped get me home last year came up to me near the end of the night on Saturday. She's around my mum's age but is a good friend of mine. I hadn't told her yet that I quit drinking (or the reasons why). But she knew. And she told me how proud she was of me. Guys I nearly broke down. Every other person that commented on my club soda was making snide remarks that I must be pregnant or were asking about the due date or seeing if I was sick (not pregnant not sick - just sober!). She saw me struggle and turn down a drink at another event last week but didn't say anything. This week she watched as I firmly yet politely declined drink offers and stuck with my sodas. It was nice to know that she noticed and she didn't think of me as 'less fun' like some of the others. She saw how much better I was getting and am still getting....I'm so so proud of myself for the way I handled this weekend and since I haven't really talked to anyone about my sobriety I figured I would share this with you. In the (almost) month I've been sober I've dealt with the stress of working 2 jobs (60+ hours/week) organized and ran a conference stopped getting drunk and eating pizza and I've lost 6 lbs. Honestly couldn't have done this without you guys. I posted a couple weeks ago when I was going through withdrawal and couldn't see the light at the end of the tunnel. I felt sick for two weeks but you guys told me I was almost there. And I made it. And I still have a long way to go but this weekend was truly a test for me and I succeeded. One club soda at a time :)

I am so very pleased for you.  Just fantastic and you should rightly feel incredibly proud of yourself...I look at myself now and compare myself with how I was 87 days ago.  There is only one sentence that can do it justice:.."I am not that person anymore"...Makes me feel happy inside :)
