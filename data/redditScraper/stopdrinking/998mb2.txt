Ridiculous conflict at work today set me off on a bad spiral of self-hatred and PTSD from previous experiences.  I'm still struggling to let it go but the GREAT news is that I didn't reach for a drink when I got home.  I was shaking and anxious and upset over the situation and I knew a drink would "calm my nerves" - but I didn't go for it.  So I will choose to focus on that victory.  IWNDWYT.

That is a victory! Good job! I hate the voice that says I deserve a drink because of whatever crap I dealt with. Good for you staying strong.
That is a huge victory! Excellent work. IWNDWYT! ..When that bad tape plays in my head I sometimes do a guided meditation that's meant to help with these kinds of emotions. I find them to be pretty helpful. Meditation Oasis has a few good ones in this vein (episodes 25 30 31 and 55 are the ones I turn to in times like the one you described). As the days roll on for me that tape is getting quieter thank goodness! Here's to turning down the volume!
Oh I can feel how upsetting this conflict was for you.  This type of work stress and then the bad feelings and self-esteem hit always set me off the rails.   Hope you are able to calm yourself and let it go.  Good job.
