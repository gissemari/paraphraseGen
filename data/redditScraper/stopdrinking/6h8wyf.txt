I'm 4 days sober after a long relapse. I live quite isolated in the country but have a place in the city. My plan was to drive into the city today for a couple weeks to a month and go to meetings and get sober with some support. Part of me just wants to give up and stay here and be alone and just try my best not to drink. I was so dead set on doing this for my recovery but now that the time has come I'm unsure. I'm feeling so confused and most of all I feel unworthy of other people's help although I know I need it. ..Does anyone else make concrete plans to get help then at the last minute want to chicken out and continue the downwards spiral of being alone and depressed?

I think taking that first step into a recovery meeting is an extremely difficult thing to do and there will always be 1000 reasons not to do it.  ...But there is at least one very good reason to swallow your fear and do it anyway.
Having a support system made sobriety easier and more fun. 
At least you want to try not to drink.  When I "give up" I REALLY give up.  It's not good to be home alone and depressed.  Do you have a sober friend (or someone who doesn't drink much) you can stay with for a little while?  I just recently got sober again and my roommate was kind enough to stay home with me for 3 days and babysit me.  It helps a lot!
People help. Temptation looms. How comfortable are you in your sobriety?
You could try a SMART meeting they have online ones frequently. Just google.
