I got sober in 2015. I was almost to 500 days sober when I decided that I could have a few drinks here and there. Well you all know how that goes. Anyway this past weekend a family member came to stay with us and we had some drinks. It was fraction of what I used to drink but on Saturday morning I felt pretty terrible and was reminded of how much I hate alcohol. Apparently not enough because later that night I drank again. On Sunday I felt like DEATH. I haven't felt that shitty in years. I even wondered if I had food poisoning. (Nope) I suffered throughout the day and tried to pretend I was normal as I spent time with my family. On Monday I was still feeling pretty rough. I spent most of the day on the couch too tired to move. It was like my body was like "Fuck you! Not this again I'll show you!" ..Drinking sucks and it's never worth it. Lesson learned. Again.
