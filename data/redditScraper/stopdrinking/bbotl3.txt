I have great trouble stringing together more than 2 weeks of abstinence. Anytime I fall of the wagon its just for a day or a night and I immediately resume not drinking. ..I'm setting a goal today of 30 consecutive days abstinence. Day 1 will be tomorrow as i relapsed early this morning. As I type this I'm nervous that I won't make it. Although I will try as I always do. ..I have been busy as hell lately in effort to prevent relapse. Obviously didn't work. Idk what to do. I do spend a lot of my free time on Reddit to escape the bs in my mind. I like to think that it's ok to do that but I also feel as though I need to be more present with my family. ..Pity party: I feel like a fucking worthless piece of shit. I hate living but am too big of a pussy to kill myself. ..Anti-pity party: I do see good qualities in myself during abstinence. I'm glad I'm too big of a pussy to kill myself...*30 days beginning tomorrow.... sobering up today
