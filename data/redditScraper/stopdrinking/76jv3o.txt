Recovering from a major lapse. All the usual stuff.  Progressed from one beer two beers bottle of wine box of wine fifth of whiskey a day over a few months. Amazing how fast a relapse engulfs you. ..First week was less rough than I thought it would be. Some night sweats and getting really overwhelmed in loud situations. A few heart palpitations. Some dizziness on day 3. Most things settled down by day 5. Still not sleeping well but I remember that taking time. ..I will not drink with any of you today. Have a great Sunday.
