As someone who is on day three of sobriety the passing of Jason Molina is particularly heart breaking. So sad to see such a talent fall victim to something we all struggle with.

"Molina had no health insurance and [..] his family was trying to raise money"..So embarassing ;(  Rest in piece.
Just got into his stuff about a month or two ago. This is heartbreaking. RIP
Incredibly sad.
This makes me very sad especially since I just heard recently about an old friend of mine who passed away thanks to the drink and drugs. I'm more sure than ever that my decision to stop drinking was the right thing to do. Life is just way too fragile and precious...My favorite Songs:Ohia song Two Blue Lights:.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPny4frBuVM
Damn I've been listening to his solo stuff all day today. Alone with the owls specifically. This is heartbreaking.
I've been torn up about this since I heard. So sad so unfair. Man. :(
So many nights spent listening to Didn't it Rain but for the grace of god go I 
I will be honest I have no idea who he is...Alcoholism knows no race gender talent or wealth.  
What a loss. He was a great talent.
From Edgar Allan Poe to Ernest Hemingway to John Belushi to Amy Winehouse.....
