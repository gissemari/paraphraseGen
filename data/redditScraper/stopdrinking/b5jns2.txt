I've been seeing an addiction doctor for about a year now. I've relapsed recently and he's put me on a 2 week Librium detox to keep me comfortable didn't make me feel bad about it told me relapse is part of recovery and has put me back on track. He's overall been really supportive and specializes in addiction. ..I've been to doctors before that weren't too helpful because they didn't understand. They told me to go to AA. While I think AA is beneficial for people some don't understand the dangers of withdrawal and some can make you feel bad about having an addiction...&amp;#x200B;..If you find your doctor isn't helping or if you'd just like a doctor that specializes in addiction you can look them up on this website: [https://certification.theabpm.org/physician-lookup](https://certification.theabpm.org/physician-lookup) ..&amp;#x200B;..Just wanted to share as I'm very grateful to have found this website and found my doctor. I won't drink with you today!

A year? When is the plan to be sober long term permanent though? ..&amp;#x200B;..I'm just asking because I saw a doctor for a long time he had no problem prescribing benzos to help with the withdrawals when I'd come off a binge. But after  a year or two I realized I was making no real progress... If anything he was enabling my boozing...There was no maliciousness on his part or incompetence as far as I could see. ..But there was a point where I realized he wasn't really helping any longer...&amp;#x200B;..Just my experiences...Good luck though with everything. I know it's tough.
That is very cool. I have heard of people not getting good care because a doctor didnt really understand
