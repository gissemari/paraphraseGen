I posted on here in my first week of this go around. I had blacked out again the last night of drinking for the hundredth time and woken up saying that was the last time for the hundredth time. Went to work hungover called my sponsor and told him I was fucked...I think for the first time in my life (at 28yo after 6 years of in-and-out meetings) I have truly conceded that I'm an alcoholic and cannot drink. Before I always qualified it with "I have a little drinking problem" or "it's a phase" or "I'm more of a binge drinker that makes me different". After so much time not being able to control my drinking getting sober relapsing and in that purgatory cycle I'm now convinced. It's actually a huge relief and I hope I can hold onto the clarity..
