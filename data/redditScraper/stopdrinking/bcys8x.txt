Came across this quote while reading  This Naked Mind.  I can't recommend that book enough. I am really struggling and fighting like hell. I am 34 days sober. Tomorrow I am hanging out with my ex-lover / best friend and her boyfriend. I have hung out with them before but never sober. I have wanted to drink so bad to numb the pain and make the situation bearable. I know it won't help and will only make everything worse. I control my fate. I will not drink with you today!

Thanks for that. I'm going through some major withdrawal now benzodiazepines and anti depression medication. It's a lot worse than alcohol. Your post gave me a lift
You rock! Thank you for sharing!
Great quote. I found planning to just go home if I got a craving helped the first times I went out sober. You've this. IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you today. The same will be true tomorrow. I find that true acceptance and empathy is only possible when sober. Real feelings with sef respect at the core and with that comes freedom sooner or later.
I don't think I would have gotten this 16 Day badge without This Naked Mind.  It's really changed everything.. . I mean EVERYTHING about the way I view alcohol my past relationship with alcohol and my future non-relationship with alcohol.   Good luck with the hanging out... but since you're done drinking you'll do great.    ..IWNDWYT
I know a lot of people like it but can we ban posts mentioning  this naked mind ? It's beginning to be a TNM fart chamber in here. Like. We get it you like that book quit selling it. Sorry rant over.
I also endorse this book. It's really great.
