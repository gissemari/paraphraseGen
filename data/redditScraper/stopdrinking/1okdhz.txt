Share your triumphs struggles or just general chat!..Triumph: Made an amend to a family member I haven't spoken with in years over the weekend...Struggle: Having issues with the treasurer of my old homegroup...General chat: GTA V is STILL STILL consuming me :)..Have a great 24 hours folks!
----------immediate responses--------

98 days sober here. It's about 7 am in the Midwest and I am getting ready to face another day of underemployment and living with my parents. Life could always be worse I suppose at least the Blackhawks won last night and play again tomorrow night. 
Triumph: Bought lamb..Struggle: Have to make lamb..General chat: Still not sure if I want to buy GTA IV.
Triumph: Made it a week sober after relapsing. Been going to the gym cooking eating well getting all my work done sleeping normally. It's great to be back! I don't know what was wrong with me!..Struggle: Academia is stupid y'all. Just really really pointless. I leave my seminars dejected and only do the bare minimum reading because I've lost my enthusiasm. Working on it...Chat: I may eat curry every day for the rest of my life. It's so cheap to make and so tasty!
Triumph: Realized I had fallen into old habits and started asking my wife for extra support with urges...Struggle: Relapsed over the weekend after almost 8 months of self-control and sobriety...General chat: Looking forward to a fun weekend with my wife and son at the Jacksonville Zoo.
Triumph: 42 days sober and feel awesomely relieved I haven't broken my streak...Struggle: Starting a new relationship and haven't really been in one before...no one's loved me (including family) so this is new and weird to me. I feel like he has some hidden agenda even though I KNOW he doesn't. It's just that every guy I've been with just uses me for hookups and pretends to be invested in my emotions in order to get laid. &lt;/rant&gt;..General chat: had a super weird nightmare last night. The part relevant to this subreddit is that I got wasted and made an ass of myself...except I missed the part where I had anything to drink at all. The dream jumped from one part to me walking through a house and people being pissed off at me for what I did the night before. I apologized like crazy but for the life of me couldn't remember drinking anything. It's probably my subconscious poking me with a stick about my nervousness with slipping up. I feel like I've got a hold on it though. My new boyfriend doesn't drink so that definitely helps out. ..(one of the odd unrelevant parts of my dream involved Snoop Dogg at a concert getting pissed off that people just wanted him to rap all the time so he started covering songs by Tool and NIN...I don't even listen to Tool)
Triumph: I just noticed my star changed to 9 months today.  Nice! Also I am once again committed to eating healthy.  Feeling optimistic...Struggle: not much struggling.  Just ordinary life stressors but all manageable...General chat: This morning my chickens were making a huge racket.  I went outside and saw a hawk perched on the swing set.  It was about a third the size of my chickens.  I don't think it was actually capable of snatching one but what do I know about hawks? 
Triumph: Traded my old guitar for a Fender Stratocaster.  Fixed it up with some new parts and I now finally have a guitar that fits me and I love.  Old me would have just sat around drinking and dreaming of a new guitar....Struggle:  Stressing about long term finances.  Worried my company won't bonus this year which means we wait to buy the house we want and get out of this damn city....General chat: Excited to go to band practice tonight.
Triumph: Overcame the bit of struggle I had over the weekend without too much trouble..Struggle: Bit of an urge over the weekend..General Chat: You just reminded me that I need to play some more GTA V before leaving on biz trip in a few days!
**Triumph:** Had a great 1st week at work and returned to Anonymous meetings in my new city.    ..**Struggle:** I honestly have nothing worthy of writing down :)    .   .**General Chat:** Winter is coming...Frost hit me overnight and I wasn't prepared scraped my window with my credit card (cards works well but usually I use my library card). Winter=1 Me=0...you wont get me again winter.
Triumph: I've recognized that I've gone into "dry drunk" mode.  Recognizing this means I can do something about it.  . .Struggle: The past month has been both eye-opening as well as difficult.  I realize that I'm in a toxic codependent relationship.  My relationship is not moving forward it's not going better and it's making me miserable.  I keep lying to myself that it's going to get better but I can't control my girlfriend.  I feel like I've done my best but it's time to move on.  Now I'm afraid to leave.  I'm afraid to hurt her.  I have the guilt and the feeling that I need to protect her feelings even though it's to my own detriment (I'm very much codependent as well.)  The sooner I can clear my side of the street and get on with my life the sooner I can get back to real recovery.  I'm not doing anyone any favors by pretending to be happy.  That's just dishonest and a huge roadblock in my recovery.. .General: One day at a time.  
Triumph: My non-alcoholic boyfriend asked if he could go to meetings with me from time to time so that he was better equipped to listen and 'be there' when I needed it...Struggle: Having a hard time keeping motivated in general seasonal affective bullcrap...blah...General chat: Getting a huge tattoo finished this week really 'F'ing amped up about it!
I need to get sober again and am considering attending an AA meeting at lunch that I found two blocks from my office. 
Triumph: 3 weeks today! I feel great!.Struggle: Finding time to make it to an AA meeting...still haven't done that yet..General chat: Took a break from GTA V to go back to Final Fantasy VII. Video games have been a great thing to do on those weekend nights when all my friends are at parties &amp; bars.
**Struggle**: My dog has had cancer since May and we knew there was nothing we could do.  Well... it's time. :(  We are putting her down on Friday.  It's going to be really tough.  We're really going to miss her.  And it's hard knowing that each moment I spend with her from now until Friday is among the last...**Triumph**: Given the struggle I know I won't drink.  It's just not who I am anymore.  I'm going to face the loss and deal with it.  I'm going to be there for my wife and help deal with however my other dog will act when she's gone...**General Chat**: woof..

Triumph: Walked into one of my old regular bars last night to say hi to a bartender who I hadn't seen in a long time (saw her from the street.) She asked if I'd have the usual. I told her I didn't drink anymore. She laughed and rolled her eyes. I said bye and walked out. Upon further reflection I figure I was probably just testing myself. ..Struggles: Making risotto without wine. Must find a suitable acidic substitute. (Oh I know the *horror.*)
An emotional day today - the 39th anniversary of my Dad's death. This is a day on which I need to grieve some remember and feel some real sharp stuff. In the past of course alcohol has been my companion on that voyage. It feels strange to give myself over to those feelings without it. My resolve to overcome alcohol is strong though and I am willing to accept that today is simply what I have chosen. This anniversary will come drunk or sober. 
Triumph: Family dinner last night was able to resist the drinks offered to me. It was incredibly hard. Family is hard to deal with in general but I DID IT! And I didn't have to make excuses or talk to them about it yet. ..Struggle: Still haven't told my family... which made resisting the drinks they offered incredibly hard. Also lamenting all the festive drinks I can't make or have. Fighting the urges every day now. blah...General chat: today is payday! And NONE OF IT IS GOING TOWARDS THE BIGGEST MONEY WASTER OF ALL (alcohol duh!) AND THAT IS REALLY REALLY GREAT TO KNOW AND FEEL. Today is really the first time I've seen the dollars that I know I'm saving. It's freaking awesome. Also it's payday! Yay!..Also wanted to say thanks to everyone who came and chatted/ranted on my thread yesterday. Not being in a meeting or group it was very good for me. I hope you all got something out of it too. Maybe I'll start trying to make a weekly thread if I have time. Good luck to you all for another week and the weekend coming up! &lt;3

Triumph: I spent 6 hours working on my Halloween costume this weekend. I'm over halfway done and I'm done with the annoying part. I would not have had the patience or energy to make a complex costume this year had I been drinking. . ..Struggle: I'm worried that I'm becoming a dry drunk. My insecurities are hindering me and I've been feeling sorry for myself some. Ill be going to a meeting tonight after yoga (which is after work). I'm going to one I've never been to before and I am a bit nervous but I do realize how silly that is. Recovering alcoholics are in my experience very nice people. ..I guess this will be my general chat. Part of why ( or at least the reason I gave to myself) I didn't go to another meeting after my last one was because one of the members stopped me after and was asking why I think I'm an alcoholic. I gave my reasons why us didn't want to drink anymore and he kept interrupting me and saying "well that doesn't make you alcoholic" and I felt annoyed and belittled. Fuck you I AM an alcoholic! Just because I am not in legal trouble and I still have my job doesn't mean I'm not a train wreck when I drink. I had a week of physical withdrawals which really indicated to me that my problem was greater than I originally thought. Anyway clearly that really got to me. ..
Triumph: Been through several situations in which I would normally have had a drink (including some friends coming over with dinner and beer) and didn't.  I am starting to really think of myself as Someone Who Does Not Drink if that makes any sense.  Like a lot of drunks I have always secretly admired teetotalers and now I am seeing myself from the outside and feeling good about being one myself...Struggle: Trying not to psych myself out by thinking ahead to Thanksgiving Christmas and some business travel I have coming up next year.  When I picture myself not drinking at these events I immediately start to feel anxious and weird even though it doesn't feel weird at all when I'm not drinking in the moment...General chat: Had a dream about a friend I've been feeling resentful toward lately.  Think I'll give him a call today.
Triumph: Actually went a few days without thinking about drinking very much at all.  It's not at the forefront of my mind anymore...Struggle: The one time I did think about drinking it was the desire to have some nice octoberfest microbrews with friends.  I miss getting sloshed by a campfire a lot but I know the end result of that desire...General chat:  GTA V is nice but I prefer online PC games:  Torchlight 2 is rocking it for me right now.
Triumph: Made it to work on time looking good and lost another pound. .Struggle: Money and not being mad at my husband for going hunting for a week when we are dead broke. Emotional I'm all over the place. .General chat: I have no idea what I'm making for dinner. I hate making dinner. 
Triumph: went to my meeting and got an opportunity for service work..Struggle: not sure how to address a situation to my love interest...General: I drove to a neighbor town 15 minutes away just to get some A&amp;W. No regrets! I feel very peaceful lately.
Triumph: Just got back from a work dinner with my ex also in attendance. I didn't drink and my (pre-planned) strategies how to deal when I had a tougher time (either not drinking or dealing with my ex but those are intimately intertwined!) worked well: I went for a smoke alone did some mini-relaxation exercise and one time I went for a smoke together and had a short chat. Oh and my bill was 10 EUR lower than that of the drinkers (i.e. most of them)...Struggle: She can't seem to relax in my presence and that stresses me out too (so my therapist is right; first time I saw it this clearly). I'm probably going to have to let go of the idea that we can be friends for the time being and that makes me sad...General: I was on my bike for more than two hours today (had to work at two different places) normally I would have taken the bus. And I did 15 minutes of yoga (and 10 of ironing) by myself before the dinner that helped too.
50 days! Still no job but 50 days sober feels good.
GTA ONLINE!!!
Wow this is a popular thread!..Triumph: going back to school and I qualify for a crap ton of student aid.  I'm really starting to enjoy living on my own. Met a girl I really like. Might have a really good job opportunity by the end of the year. Feeling really healthy and motivated to do all the little stuff that I ignored in my depressed lull of a life I was living. Been hanging with friends at bars with no problem which says to me my problem wasn't reeeally with the alcohol it was something else. What that is I'm not quite sure yet.  ...Struggle: learning more about myself and getting in touch with my emotions and what not as the initial euphoria of new found sobriety starts to fade. It's a psychological minefield that is all new to me. It's both enlightening and a little maddening but at least it's interesting. I can't tell if the girl I like is into me or if she is just touchy and flirty with everyone but we hang out a lot. My job might not exist by the end of the year. I have to move back into my old house at the end of the month after my sublet ends just when I'm starting to enjoy living on my own. ..Chat: Lost my hockey game this week against the first place team. I'm still bummed about this. But my Sabres got their first win of the season...FINALLY.
