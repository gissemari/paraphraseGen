I check back in here periodically partly because /r/stopdrinking has my sobriety counter partly as a reminder to myself...Three days ago I had a reminder that even this relatively far along (i know someone just recently posted about 4000 (!) days) having a drinking problem doesn't go away. I was in Townsville for the day from Brisbane for an onsite callout (literally changing a harddrive in an storage array). Finished early went back to airport to wait 3 hours caught up on some work and then looked at the cafe/bar where a lot of fly-in/fly-out folks were having a drink. The thought crossed my mind and I remembered the pleasurable experience a good beer or glass of red offered but pushed it to the side remembering what followed from that first drink. One was never enough two was always too many...It's also Ramadan at present. A few years ago I would have been skipping a few days of fasting in Ramadan because I'd be getting through a sixpack and a couple of bottles of shiraz-cab while playing the latest AC ME DA or FO game. I did 40min of MEA last night on my outdated rig first time in about 30 days (I'm a huge Mass Effect fan but have a 4 month old so me time is not a thing much anymore lol). Got a quick run in then packed it in for an early night and early wakeup with bub...I also started losing some weight after stopping drinking not because of the non-drinking but because I started cycling to work. I felt a heck of a lot better. Since then life has intervened with a child which has disrupted that ability to spend an extra hour a day commuting via bicycle so the wait has started reversing. But that just feels like ordinary real life a world away from the secret life of drinking I once lived in...Edit: Oh and we have a daughter. Truly a Godsend. Everything everyone told us couldnt prepare us for the joy and stress and fatigue all interwoven that it is. I suspect in the wrong circumstances being a father wouldn't prevent me from relapsing but it does provide an additional layer of insulation or encouragement to avoid that old life that helps reinforce the habits I've built up to avoid the old ways.
