After 3\+ months of (believing I was) kicking alcoholism in the ass  the triggers reared their ugly heads in and I'm back to square one. ..This is really an effort.   I've been adamant about not attending AA meetings for many reasons but I think I just have to suck it up and go tonight. ..One positive thing I can share is  although life will always deal some heavy blows  it doesn't have to be the end of the world.  Everyone suffers. ..I interned for a prominent designer in my college years who recently took her life and alcoholism was something she was struggling with.  ..This is something that clearly does not discriminate.  ..Thanks for listening.

Progression is not linear. .You made it 3 months. .Thats still really impressive. .you should be proud of yourself and just see this as a bump in the road. .Im 4 days in and I want to shout the benefits of sobriety on rooftops. lol.....But i know this feeling will fade and I will be tempted again. .Just hang in there!.Did you intern for Kate spade by chance?
AA saved my ass. Keep us posted on how it goes. 
Shit happens. Onward we go.
You will never be back to square one again. What you learned in those months of sobriety doesn't vanish; nor do those months now turn into drunk months. Relapse is often a part of the journey. You can do this. IWNDWYT 
I slipped up at over 3 months last time too.. and I'm almost back up there.  I was down on myself at first but I learned from it and carried on.  We got this!
Thanks for your post! My mind did the same thing to me thought I kicked alcoholic ways behind me. I will not drink with you today.
