Feel like I have a million obstacles ahead of me and not always sure I have the will to fight. But I'm just not going to drink tonight. Period. I won't do it tonight. Thanks SD.

Hang in there!
You made it one day-- proof you have the will to fight one day at a time. That's all we have! I'll join you in not drinking tonight. 
Sometimes it comes down to not winning the war it's a matter of winning one small battle at a time. Good job on Day 1!
I totally understand that feeling it can feel a bit overwhelming sometimes for me. I spent like 5 years drinking my life away and now I have to deal with all of those things that I had put off for so long. But every little obstacle is also a little goal and these are goals that we can achieve. I will not drink tonight alongside you thanks for your post and stay strong!
the longest journey begins with the first step... your journey has now begun... Rejoice you are on your way to a much better life
Don't worry about tomorrow or even an hour from now if you're really struggling. Just keep making the decision to not drink. You got this :)
You can do it!
