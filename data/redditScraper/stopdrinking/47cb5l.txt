Taking 15 units in school possible job mom and sister are not too happy right now cause I relapsed. They were hoping I'd stay sober forever.

Well you are here so it's a great start. I've had many day ones. But never had this site before. I hope to make this the final day one. I would make yourself happy and your family will follow. And I would try not to be too hard on yourself. Xo
