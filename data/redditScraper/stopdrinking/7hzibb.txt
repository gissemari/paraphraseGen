Went to see my therapist today after three weeks of him being in vacation. He told me I looked great! Gained back some of the weight that I lost struggling with leaving my husband and anxiety. And he was proud of how strong I've become in dealing with life and sobriety. May not seem like a big deal but a year ago I was a hot drunken mess and look at me now!

Great job! You earned the good feeling.
great to hear!
It's a ***HUGE*** deal! I'm so happy you're feeling better. 
Yay you!  Terrific!
