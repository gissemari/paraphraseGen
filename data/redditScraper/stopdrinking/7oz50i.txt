I was recently forced to resign my position as a paralegal due to drinking. Since then I have been to rehab and while I did relapse I'm back on track again. I'm applying for a big law firm and one of the questions asks "have you ever been discharged from a job or forced to resign? If yes please explain."..My former employer already said he would refuse to talk to anyone who calls. So should I just say No? Or tell my story? ..I don't want to ruin my chances of this great opportunity.

This is a difficult one. Generally I'm all for telling the truth but there does still exist a lot of prejudice around alcoholism.  And I get needing a job! ..I'll tell you what I did when it came up right or wrong.  The resignation I wrote was not backed by any paper trail associated to drinking so I didn't tell them that but did say we reached a mutual conclusion that it wasn't a good fit with my health issues as they were...The question is ultimately unfair. A  forced resignation  is away for an employer to not fire you. It's a way for the two of you to try to part ways amicably. The employer generally is also trying to do the right thing by you and the company at the same time by asking for it...I don't work in legal but in another public field where that sort of thing is asked on every single resume. And even once is enough for you to be cut out from 90 percent of jobs.
Thanks. I decided to put "no" because the terms of my resignation contract are confidential. He can't tell them so I don't need to. I re read my contract numerous times. I really need this job so fingers crossed!
