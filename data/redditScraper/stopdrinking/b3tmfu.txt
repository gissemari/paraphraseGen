Welp somehow I'm here again. 6 months sober down the drain. This morning as I sit here dealing with the shakes and dizziness that I'm trying to hide I'm contemplating what triggered my three week bender. I stopped drinking with relative ease months ago. My doctor had informed me that my cholesterol was too high and I was pre-diabetic. I knew I had to change. I had finally found the motivation to stop after drinking heavily every day for 2 years.  I lost weight and had energy. I felt good about myself for the first times in years. My health improved. I got too comfortable. ..Then is all came crashing down around me. ..The sad thing is that the day before I relapsed I was thinking about how happy I was with my new lifestyle and felt relieved that I was free from alcohol's complications. I wouldn't have to sneak booze in my suitcase on vacation and binge drink it in the bathroom after everyone else was asleep. I didn't have to live in fear that someone other than my husband would find out how much I drank. My mother wouldn't be devastatingly disappointed in me. I wouldn't have to worry about my son's teacher smelling yesterday's alcohol on my breath when I dropped him off at school. I wouldn't have to drink before going out with friends so the amount I drank in public looked acceptable. I wouldn't have to slowly kill myself anymore. I was closer to being the mother my children deserve. I've thrown away my progress. ..So now I'm here again. And I can't figure out how to stop.
