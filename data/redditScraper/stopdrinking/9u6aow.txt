I have been reading everyone's post and it's very helpful I want to quit drinking but sometimes I get so stressed out at work nothing helps you relax like a beer or a glass of wine but when that glass of wine turns into the bottle of wine....hangovers are terrible and getting worse as I get older...doesn't help my anxiety much either! I feel like I would struggle more with my friends because they all love to drink but handle it a lot better I drink until I black out and puke all day the next day...any tips to get through these days would be helpful and appreciated.

Perhaps your doctor about your anxiety. Sometimes they can give you medication that can help in the short-term or just once in awhile when you feel it would help.
For me exercise is an amazing replacement for getting rid of the work stress. They key us to find something you enjoy- my wife swears by yoga I like to run. But try a few things and see what sticks. We also like to hike and walk together when our schedules permit. ..I feel like you have to give whatever it is at least 6 weeks or so before you decide that it helps or not or you need a different activity..
