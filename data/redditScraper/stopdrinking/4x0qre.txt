[It's. that. day. again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi9eTOqqTMs)..You guessed it. Happy hump day! What's up Wednesdays are when we calibrate our sobriety check in see how our /sd buds are doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations with us below!..**Triumph:** Have a few days off next week and I'm planning my first brisket along with possibly hand-making the sides this time. Potentials include: potato salad cole slaw beans and maybe a corn bread. I'm really enjoying the whole experience of the cooking and then preparing everything. Finding recipes to try is fun. I want to buy a better chef's knife. ..**Struggle:** Nothing really on my mind this week. Things are good have some R & R coming up and I plan to chill out. ..**General:** Let's have a good old fashioned question this week. Breakfast drink what's your fave? Mine will probably always be [Coffee.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6YZA43fitk) What about you? 
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph: I'm still sober no major troubles all problems are quality ones right now. Made it through the most boring in-law wedding in my life! I turned down the champagne for a toast and the server goes "but it's for a toast"! I normally carefully guard my anonymity but it was wife's side of the family and do you think they DON'T know my story indirectly? Right my point exactly. So I told the guy "No I'll be toast if I drink that!" He came right back with an iced tea and apologized. I had to laugh...Struggle: Email &amp; telephone nonstop all day like way more than usual. What am I complaining about? It could be the other way around right?..General: Agreed cafe no doubt about it! :)
**Triumph:** After years if not decades of not doing any artwork because I feared I would not be good I have been trying my hand at collage. (Did you know that collage was invented by Pablo Picasso?) I have been having so much fun doing it. I started with a collage class at a great studio out by the ocean. Now I am planning to go to another class this time on printmaking.
**Triumph:** Got through my first week hitting the gym feeling great. I was open with family and friends about my decision to quit drinking and remain sober. Everyone has been very positive and agreed that it's the best thing for me (and possibly them haha). ..**Struggle:** My job is probably a factor in why I drink I loathe it so much but I've been applying to other jobs more suited to my career choices. Just have to take it a day at a time...**General:** I'm alive so I got that going for me. I am in general in good spirits - I know it's going to take time to get back to the "real" me the one without the booze but I'm willing to be patient and persist with it. I'm enjoying a milky coffee.
**Triumph:** Started learning Modern Hebrew this week. It is fun challenging and keeps me busy (and therefore sober). Hope to be somewhat fluent at reading words by the start of next week...**Struggle:** Boredom and lack of motivation at work mainly. Got to start looking for a new position sooner or later. Also didn't get enough sleep these past couple of nights. ..**General:** I always have 2-3 cups of coffee and a glass of Berocca for breakfast. Right now I'm drinking soy milk hot chocolate.
**Triumph:** Still not drinking! I'm now the lowest weight I've been for about 4/5 years since I started cycling again as an adult 7 years ago today...**Struggle:** In a little bit of a work funk at the moment. I seem to have lost a bit of momentum and inspiration...**General:** My breakfast drink is coffee too. I have recently started cutting it 50/50 with the decaff equivalent of my favourite brand Lavassa.
Triumph: This Saturday I will be celebrating 6 months. WHAT?!?! My only wish is to celebrate it with ice cream (or gelato froyo etc.) with SDer's around the globe. After all I wouldn't have gotten here without you guys..xoxo ;).*Special Request: A Straty-dance-gif......Struggle: Nothin' right now..yay!!..General: Good old fashioned coffee :)
**Triumph** I made it through 8 days of being alone at home while my family was traveling and did not drink alcohol or do anything else self destructive.  .**Struggle** I am still feeling generally apathetic and unmotivated. I'm going on a vacation of sorts next week (seeing family) and hope I'll feel like my normal self by then..**General** Coffee in the morning with a splash of milk. Or rather splash of milk and then coffee; order matters.
Triumph: I'm still sober. I got myself out of two really shitty situations last week that were not good for me. I took the initiative and just walked out both times. I'm still sober...Struggle: Still feeling pretty lonely and a million thoughts are going through my mind about what I'm going to do with my life if I'll ever fall in love with someone and have a family and the future I always wanted if my life actually is able to be turned around. I'm also realising alot of the dreams I had in the last were more fantasies than anything else. I've been a bit sick run down and a bit disengaged from my sobriety but I'll be ok. I have you guys!..General: Coffee. Always. 
Triumph: I have started telling people "I don't drink" instead of saying "I'm not drinking for a bit" or "I'm not drinking because _____." Subtle difference but I feel... different. Not drinking feels like less of an effort and more of a natural default setting. ..Struggle: work is kicking my candy ass. My boss is out because of surgery so learning on the fly how to do her job while staying on top of managing my clients isn't fun at all. Still it's better than sitting around twiddling my thumbs. Just gotta keep jamming Jeezy to get my mind right. ..General: two scoops (6g) of beta alanine powder two scoops (6g) of citrulline powder and 300 mg caffeine. Morning workouts are a major  
**Triumph** I made it through a weekend at the casino for my SO's birthday soberly! I also went way out of my comfort zone to get this set up; making the reservations actually convincing them to comp me for a Friday night coordinating to not have the grandkids for the weekend. He figured out the surprise well ahead of time but we had a great weekend. And I drank fancy sparkly water in our room like a [rock star!](http://imgur.com/1R0iZ5s)..**Struggle** Free drinks at the casino got nothing on me. $1 drafts at the races? More like $1 gut rot no thanks. Seeing a six pack of October fest beer at a random gas station on the drive home? Holy shit! October fest already? I want want want! Weird. I was surrounded by drinks all weekend that I was prepared to not drink and had no problems. I unexpectedly saw a kind of beer that I like and it's put me in a funk for the past 2 days...**General** Coffee all the way!
**Triumph**  ..another weekend successfully negotiated at my boyfriend's parents. they all drink pretty heavily but at this point no one even bothers asking me if I'd like wine. As the glasses are brought out I'm relieved to see there's only 4. My boyfriend's step mom did ask me condescendingly (she doesn't really MEAN to sound this way which is unfortunate I'd rather just hate her guilt-free) if I'd like a glass for my soda water so I can be more *elegant*. I said nope can's fine. she said the aluminum's bad for me (as she drinks her fourth glass of wine...) and I said sunnily "oh I don't care" and sipped my la croix.   ..**Struggle**  ..my birthday's coming up. I'll be 29. I know my boyfriend's brother will be pushing wine/whatever else at me because its my birthday. Our birthday actually my boyfriend and I share the same day. He's got this 2006 Adobe Road Cabernet that he's been saving and is already insisting I have a glass. Part of me is like "whats the big deal? adobe road IS special especially aged 10 years!" but the truth is...I was never a very accomplished wine taster. I drank it all pretty non discriminately. And besides if a slide and inevitable crash is in my future I don't want to mark it's beginning with my birthday. I still don't know if I want to quit forever or not but definitely not *for now*. Drinking now still seems so needlessly reckless its almost childish. It is so clearly terrible for me and my relationships. Why even fuck around with it? Also drinking on my birthday (and subsequently having to tell you guys and reset my badge) seems like a really shitty birthday gift.  ..**general** ..going on a boat cruise work outing today. we'd voted on venues for this outing and I voted 'roof top bar' so I could sneak away and go home an hour or so in but the boat cruise won out. 3 hours on a yacht sailing the hudson with likely an open bar. I'm not worried I'll drink or anything. But I know there'll come a time when everyone gets super drunk and I'll want to go home and knit or work on my personal site but I won't be able to because I'llllllll be on a boat in the middle of the Hudson. sigh. On a lighter side: I finally ironed out this [animation for a bit](http://codepen.io/12Noone/pen/NAEodz) of my site that I"m really pretty pleased about.  It's gonna be for the digital resume/background section (complete with TL;DR download-button for a pdf cuz I know recruiters ain't got time for dat). hope everyone's well!
**Triumph:** Over the last month I've watched a friend turn a huge corner with his sobriety. It's gone from something he has to do to something he *wants* to do. That is great to see. He said some of the things I said and suggested were key. That is a very rewarding feeling...**Struggle:** Deadlines on work projects are close. [The wave is breaking](https://youtu.be/FLV_Aw-a7jE?t=5s)...**General:** ..#COFFEE
**Triumph :** Exercising more regularly and feeling good about it.  Took care of a small house project that's been bugging me. I'm realizing that my big challenge right now is to build the discipline to act on things I care about even when I'm feeling inertia. This has so much to do with why I drank. There is no therapizing it no reasoning it there is just doing it. Even something small but every day. It's a muscle that I let atrophy...**Struggle :** See above...**General:** Coffee with heavy cream no sugar. But I can rock a spicy chai too.
**Triumph:** I'm still not drinking despite huge urges to do so since last weekend...**Struggle:** I saw my doctor yesterday. He changed my medication and put me on an intermittent fasting diet. Today is my first fast day I'm pretty nervous as to what it'll do to my already unstable mood. The next few weeks are going to be rough no matter if the new medication and diet works or not...**General:** Coffee with frothed milk or with lots of cream! Chai latte. Berry smoothies with yogurt in them. Shit I'm hungry. Damn fasting haha!
Triumph: On day 17. The cravings are definitely lessening big time. ..Struggle: Dealing with all the free time on the weekends but I'm getting the hang of it. Playstation and I are about to be real close...General: Not drinking is starting to feel REALLY good.
Triumph: no real alcohol cravings yet! I realize this may be short-lived. I also don't really feel bad not drinking around friends. The other times I've stopped drinking I felt awkward and left out of the "drinking people's club". This time I.....:almost feel bad for people who drink! I'm like "oh there goes your risk for a few types of cancer up up up and mental clarity/health down down down and so many calories and $$$ooo many dollars". I'm proud of being sober...Struggle: I've cried every day since I stopped drinking. I kind of feel great after I cry so I don't hate it but I do look forward to my emotions stabilizing maybe hopefully at some point in the future......General: coffee and at least half a liter of h2o babaaayyyyyy
Triumph: I got my 60 day chip yesterday (and so did my sober twin!) and I've been doing well on my step work. Starting to learn tools for how to stay calm during times of stress- my sponsor is like an expert so I've just been following his advice. ..Struggle: My mom is dealing with a fatal heart condition and I'm dealing with my recurring eye condition. Not fun. Also still struggling with motivation at work although I'm doing better than a few weeks ago. ..General: i love coffee but since that's everyone's answer I'll say that I also love a kale smoothie in the morning. :) 
**Triumph:** Not drinking is going smoothly and well. In addition I am starting to work on my food addiction. I am reading a book that is confirming my suspicions--- which is that if I start eating a food and find it very difficult to put down or if I eat secretly and feel ashamed I probably have a problematic relationship with food. So I'm looking forward to stepping out of the obesity bracket! Quitting drinking put me over the edge from near-obesity to obesity---not the quitting drinking itself but the way in which my indulgences turned from wine to junk food...**Struggle:** It's still money. I have way too many bills and way too little income. I don't even want to know how much I have at any given time and I do occasionally get "denied" when using Interac at the grocery store. I hope I can even sort of catch up some day but I don't know. My salary would actually be good if I got any sort of continuous job in my field. Otherwise I work for day wages. I am pretty sure I just need to get a night job or something which sucks but we do what we have to...**General:** Oh it's coffee for sure!
Triumph:  My 4 year old daughter is absolutely loving the olympics.  She loves to watch the "girl" divers and gymnasts and swimmers.  I guess it never really occurred to me that all the sports I've watched are male until now.  Yesterday we had the day off work because our firm got attacked by Ransomware (yikes!!) but instead of treating that as an opportunity to get wasted the night before I just went about my evening as usual and kept her out of daycare to spend the day together.  We bought a globe so I could show her where the different countries are that all the competitors are from and where the olympics are being held went to the pool to practice our Olympic swimming and just played all day.   She would have been in daycare if I was drinking and I would have missed that.  ..Struggle:  Nah bruh.  I'll have some more struggles come up I know; but right now just right now I feel really good.  ..General:  I've been drinking coffee blended with coconut oil and unsalted butter.  I know it sounds like absolute ass but it's wonderful and I highly recommend it.
Hi all!..Triumph: yesterday was day 1 and I made it. I joined the gym and worked out hung out with friends and got a good nights sleep...Struggle: Day 2 of no drinking and I'll be stuck home this evening with lots of temptation. Think I'm going to take my son to the park where they show an evening movie outside and try to workout while he plays so I'll be too tired to do anything but crash when I get home. ..General: Tea! I love tea delicately flavored or bold. I could drink it all day if it wouldn't turn my teeth yellow. 
Triumph: I'm 16 days into an alcohol free body and I feel amazing. I've made it this far before but always struggled with wanting a drink. After some reading and introspection each day I am dealing much better this time around! I am excited for life again!..Favorite breakfast: COFFEEEEEEE   
Triumph:  I made it to double digits.  Not sure how long its been since I've gone ten days without a single drink but probably a few years.  It feels good :)  Also I just got home from my very first therapy session.  Wasn't as scary as I expected and I'm honestly excited to be on the right path to being happier and healthier.  Already rescheduled for next week...Struggle:  I still find myself with lingering feelings towards someone and despite us splitting before I think she might have the same lingering feelings toward me.  I've decided to text her today to see if there is any chance that we move forward or if I need to rip the bandaid off completely.  Either way I won't be using alcohol to cope...General:  I'm going to the fair today to get drunk on corndogs and giant stuffed animals!
Triumph: ive made a start and am getting through day 3! Slow and steady wins the race..Struggle: I'm eating junk and dwelling on social situations that are coming up that I know I will want to drink at but I can't avoid...General: Black Coffee. Every time.
Hi OP thanks for the opportunity to share!..Triumph: If all goes well at the doctor today I get to go back to work tomorrow! I've been off all summer recovering from foot surgery and am excited to return. ..Struggle: Since I have been off my feet for the most part my apartment is really looking shabby. I need to pace myself and learn to be content with a messy home (accept the things I cannot change) for the moment but that doesn't stop me from dreaming about all the improvement I will get up to once I am able to walk again...General: I'm with you- coffee is best in the morning followed by pulp free orange juice. 
**Triumph:** I'm starting to get my place back to a clean state with laundry and dishes and I've been working really hard at work. ..**Struggle:** I missed our meeting this AM because I didn't hear my alarm or it didn't go off. I stayed up way too late and took a Lorazepam to help me sleep. Maybe that had everything to do with it. Either way I'm ensuring I have the most obnoxious alarm clock for tomorrow and I won't make the mistake again. I feel really guilty about this but at least I'm not hungover. ..**General:** Should be a good day. I'm working from home so have the opportunity to catch up on laundry and cleaning without the commute. Also looking forward to personal training tonight and sticking to my nutrition plan today and taking all my supplements. 
Triumph: I finally finished all the requirements for my master's degree!!  I feel a thousand pounds lighter and pretty pleased with the accomplishment. ..Struggle: Upon finishing said degree I now have more free time and several friends who want to take me out to celebrate. I feel like I'm going to be the buzz kill at my own party. The temptation is there but so far so good. I don't want to undo one achievement in the course of celebrating another. ..General: Tea with milk and sugar over ice.
Triumph: Was handed a margarita last night at book club and said "that looks delicious but no thank you". It wasn't a big deal my friend wasn't offended and I still had a great time...Struggle: Now that I'm sober I am able to see my life clearly. I've been asking myself am I happy with my job? my apartment? my boyfriend? Is this good enough? Can I do better now that I don't have alcohol holding me back?..General: I'm loving waking up without hangovers every morning!
Triumph: I am thankful for 46 days of freedom--my longest stretch since 2004...Struggle: 1) I struggle with the thought of returning to school to teach alongside another professor who has been a bully toward me and others in the past. In my head I call him "the passive micro aggressive bully." 2) I realized last night I'm my own worst bully and that now I'm free from alcohol id like to free myself from some of the negative intrusive thoughts I harbor about myself...General: happy to be making steady progress on projects and goals here in the middle of the week....One step at a time.
My little triumph: On day two in a row of getting up at a human hour (7:30am) and following my new routine (or what I hope will be after more than two days). Made the bed did my stretches 10 minutes meditation 20 minutes of cardio and now I'm drinking my breakfast smoothie before I shower and get ready for my Wednesday therapy appointment at 10am. ..Bigger triumph: I told my local best friend yesterday that I had a problem and intend to quit drinking. I was scared of alienating her but she was very supportive and kind (she's a child of alcoholics so is no stranger to the addiction though she doesn't drink herself)...I'm still struggling daily with the usual pings of craving that start after lunch and recur throughout the afternoon but I'm gradually learning to be aware of them and strangle those little fuckers as well as I can. ..I don't do coffee but one of my favorite afternoon lull drinks is kombucha especially the kind with the chia seeds (I guess I like chewy beverages).
**Triumph:** I applied for an open position at my company - it comes with way more responsibility and stress but it's also a huge career move. I'm proud of myself for cleaning my resume doing my prep work and taking the leap. ..I promised myself (and a coworker) that if I get the job I'll treat myself to the vacation I've always wanted: [a motorcycle tour through Mongolia.](https://youtu.be/r50TyhceTbQ) I can't stop thinking about it!  ..**Struggle:** self-doubt is a motherfucker. ..**General:** COFFEE full stop. 
T:  Scheduled to start fall semester next week.   Classes are paid for  bought my books and got a pair of scrubs!..S:  Baby mama left town.  I have my daughter.   She wanted to bring our daughter with her but I was like not having that.  So yeah. .. and she won't let me have my friend or sister babysit.  She's not registered for school and I need her permission to register her for school.   I had to miss work today and tomorrow isn't looking good either.  Oh and I pay her child support.   Time to lawyer up again and I'm not looking forward to that.   ..G: I've been drinking Marianas iced coffe followed by some high pH water.  Gets my day going right.
Triumph: Took a family vacation to the Oregon Coast last week. I forgot pot was legal up there now and didn't remember until I started seeing dispensaries everywhere. Alcohol's always been my DOC but I have used marijuana in the past. I was tempted a few times to get some but I was able to play the tape forward and know I would be back to drinking in no time. I also would have been trying to hide it and deceitful to my SO. My 44 days is not only off alcohol but any other mind altering substance as well...Struggle: I went to a DBSA (bipolar) support group last night. One woman was taking a long time sharing and interrupting others. There are only 2 meetings a month both only an hour long anywhere near me and they're an hour away. It took everything I had to not walk out thinking I'll never come back. and remember "principles before personalities."..General: Coffee is mandatory. If coffee is unavailable (God help me) a Coke will do but only for about 3 times a year and never two days in a row.
Triumph: I finally starting eating healthy again I've run 9 miles this week I told most people I'm sober now. ..Struggle: I used to be a great runner and those 9 miles were seriously tough. I'm super slow again. It can be hard when I used to be so much better but I shall persist. ..General: I stopped drinking coffee because it was making me crazy anxious so green tea and water these days. My office has this amazing thing of ice cold water full of lemon and cucumber. That is pretty darn refreshing in the morning. 
Triumph: Moved into new place and new office dipped toe into local AA scene and made some connections. Decided to let go of an old grudge that was holding me back. I'm getting enough exercise even without a structured routine which I choose to attribute to living near a state park now with great hiking (definitely nothing to do with pokemon).   ..Struggle: Trying not to be overwhelmed with anxiety/paralysis pertaining to new job. I miss my friends already. Trying to be grateful for the opportunity to make new ones. I feel guilt for my happiness. Trying to remember that's just as lame as arrogance and to practice some humility in the form of accepting my success graciously. ..General: Coffee forever. But I'm not picky about it. 
**triumph:**I applied to some jobs recently and I think I'm getting stronger. My workouts aren't a struggle anymore. ..**struggle:** Some how I've gained weight despite working out eating portion appropriate size meals and keeping things clean and Whole30..**General:** I'm really big on water LOL I have about 20 ounces with breakfast. Although if I can't eat my breakfast it done reason I love me some chocolate Shakeology with carmel extract and a pinch of Himalayan salt.
**Triumph**: 20 days sober. My fiancee has noticed that I no longer snore *at all*. Up until I stopped drinking I snored regularly and had to use a CPAP for serious sleep apnea. ..**Struggle**: Defending my doctoral thesis on the 22nd getting married a week after moving across the country 2 weeks later. Feeling the pressure...**General**: Work work work
Triumph: went as a groomsmen to my fraternity brothers wedding and did not drink while under pressure to do so. lesson learned. ..Struggle: I have a big test coming up and I feel like my life depends on it I am managing my anxiety about it better than I did in the past. ..General: My spirits are up maybe if I can get past this test next month I can finally move forward with my life. I want my folks to be proud of me I also want to prove a little something to myself as well.  
Triumph: Is day two!!!..Struggle: It's day two 0_o..General : Just happy to be here and even if it's just for the moment on the right path. 
**Triumph:** After making a disappointing thick cut pork chop recipe last week I decided to try again except I cooked the chops the exact way I would do a steak (screaming hot cast iron butter in brown chops 3 minutes each side 10 minutes in a 400 degree oven).  Came out great!..**Struggle:** It seems like my cat is having a mental breakdown and I'm concerned I might need to put him on Prozac :(..**General:** Definitely coffee!  Have to have my morning caffeine.  I do like to have tomato juice in the morning sometimes if I actually want to taste my breakfast.  Otherwise it takes about 3 hours for my taste buds to "wake up".
Shit ton of problems but I'm sober. :) I know that these problems will pass and things will be ok. 
Triumph: Gaining my sober footing once again and am planning a trip to Washington D.C. with my girlfriend (she is an almost non-drinker and totally supportive of my sobriety) in September. It's giving me something really positive and tangible to focus on and look forward to. I'm finding it easier lately to be grateful...Struggle: Work and working out is kicking my ass. Physically exhausted  but that is great because it hushes up the temptation voices before they even get going...General: I needs me my coffee but I don't care about quality or taste as long as it's strong.  My true passion lies with a tall glass of true fresh squeezed OJ.
