Today has been day 3 and I'm feeling a hell of a lot better than yesterday. Thank everyone for the advice and words of encouragement and support I received during my struggle yesterday/last night. The withdrawal symptoms are virtually gone and I'm finally starting to feel like myself again. My interests and starting to come back and I haven't been in bed all day...Today I focused on being a good father to my 5 year old daughter as I have her for the weekend. Today is her mother's birthday so who knows what kind of trouble she's getting into. We broke up 2 years ago today so it kind of a weird time of year for me to get through. But overall things are slowly getting back to "normal" and I'm feeling good about it. Thanks to everyone again who has helped me. I truly and deeply appreciate it. IWNDWYT

That's awesome. Congratulations 
Glad to hear it. I checked back to see how you were doing. 
It will continue to get a little better each day. Keep going and enjoy the clarity friend. I will not drink with you tonight.
Glad you made it through the night and that you are feeling better! Way to go! 
Well done.  Children deserve sober parents.  I read your longer post and wish you well.  It's a horrible illness.  I couldn't do it alone and had to get outside help treatment then recovery.  
Great decision... I wish you the best and I won't drink with you today!
Good job! and way to be a rock for your daughter...IWNDWYT 
I'm glad you're feeling better!  Keep going--it'll get even better. 
Hey me too! Sounds like things are going alright so far. Keep it up.
