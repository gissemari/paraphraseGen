Today is nearing the end of day 3 for me.  I'm 30 years old and have been drinking what I would consider heavily since I was 21.  There were months and years that were less so than others but drinking was always on my mind and always something I looked forward to made excuses for put over other obligations etc.  I actually decided to stop drinking because I am trying to get fit and have been struggling to stay within my calorie goals because of the drinking.  It really made me evaluate why on earth I felt it so necessary to drink when it was so working against all my goals.  After browsing this sub for a few days and seeing sooo many things that resonated true for me I realized I really am an alcoholic there's no denying it anymore. ..I've tried to stop or cut back in the past and it's never stuck.  I regret all the days spent hung over and hate that horrible feeling of doom and embarrassment not sure exactly what i did or what I said to who because I just don't remember.  I don't want to do that ever again.  And clearly I cannot trust myself to drink moderately and avoid going overboard.  ..I'm 'lucky' I guess in that I don't really have any family depending on me no debt a decent job and never been arrested or any high drama in my life.  But I feel like I've been in a downward spiral and only just keeping it together.  I don't do much of the things I used to enjoy I constantly think about the next time I'll be able to drink I have very few friends I generally hate the person I've become and I'm scared of what could happen next.  ..Luckily I feel like I know what to do to get out of this.  Over the last two weeks I've started eating better exercising getting outside more and finally I stopped drinking.  I've considered going to a meeting or getting a therapist but I guess that's a barrier I'm afraid to cross at the moment.  I told a close friend that this is the last time I'm trying to quit on my own.  If I can't do it that's it I'll need to get help.  ..I feel like I've made some big steps these last couple of days and maybe I'll make some others soon..

Welcome! 3 days is HUGE. Glad you're here!
Sending positive energy your way.  Getting sober takes what it takes.  No wrong way to do it just do it.  Asking for help is ok too.  I know I had to.  Take care.
