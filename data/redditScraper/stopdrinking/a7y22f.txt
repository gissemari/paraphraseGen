Hi everyone!..Yesterday after the Wednesday night  Breakfast Club  AA meeting a bunch of us went out for fellowship (getting food and hanging out.) And later on another group of people showed up after a different meeting so people were bouncing around between tables and talking. It was so much fun. I can't remember the last time that I had that much fun for real. It felt like being a teenager again but in a good way. It's been years since I've been able to easily connect with people in a real way like that. *Years.* ..It was definitely *waaay* better than anything was at the end of my drinking when I was isolating and depressed and stuck in my head all of the time. Alcoholics are fucking fun people it's just the alcohol that gets in the way...One of the nice things about hanging out with people who I know from meetings is that it's really easy to flip back and forth between joking around and shooting the shit and talking about serious stuff. We all know that the serious stuff is there and we're not afraid of facing it. In fact we know that it feels good to talk about it and get it out. At the same time life is funny we're glad to be alive (we're never all depressed at once anyway) and we don't take ourselves too seriously. And actually that was something that we talked about for a bit how finding humor in our recovery is a sign of healing. Which I had never really thought about before but makes sense and feels true...I went to AA meetings the last time that I got sober but I kept fellowshipping and socializing at arms length. Because I had no idea how much fun it was. And it's taken some awkward hanging out to get where I am it wasn't super fun at first. But I'm *so* glad that I stuck with it. Fellowshipping is where it's *at*. ..Earlier yesterday I was thinking about how much I've lost in my life over the past couple of years. And it's not all because of my addiction a lot of circumstances in my life have just changed. Not in a maudlin way I was just thinking about how the things in my life that kept me busy the last time that I got sober are all gone. I had more relationships more stuff and I was busier but I was pretty flipping *miserable* in my life before and it was unmanageable. My life looked good on paper but it took a lot of work just to keep my head above water and that's all I was barely doing. Treading water...I'm glad that things have changed but I'm struggling to find my feet in a lot of ways. Some things that I wanted haven't worked out. I'm uncertain of where I'm going my next steps aren't massively clear and I don't seem to be making a lot of progress. I feel a bit stuck...But I know that that's partially just my alcoholic mindset kicking in - I want the instant fix and the immediate gratification. I will get where I need and want to go it's just not going to happen immediately and easily. It's not going to happen in my desired timeframe and it's not entirely under my control. I have to just keep working away at doing what I can and trust that the bigger picture will unfold...I'm grateful that I have space in my life now to build a life in sobriety that is healthy for me. And I'm grateful that I have room in my life for things like fellowshipping. I wouldn't have room in my life for this if other things in my life were still there. And I am now living a life where I can grow and be happy. ..Anyway I'm glad that you all are here. Enjoy the little things sobernauts. I hope that you all are well and I will check in again tomorrow...Ginger_Sprout Out

Thanks for sharing you very realistic and inspiring journey. IWNDWYT 
Great share Ginger!..A *significant* percentage of posts herein are in the domain of "how will I socialize?"; "I have FOMO"; "How can i **do** anything without alcohol?" etc. etc...&gt;Fellowshipping is where it's at...It's just amazing the connections I can have with people in the absence of *impairing agents* especially when I am honest and open and vulnerable.  ..&gt;it's really easy to flip back and forth between joking around and shooting the shit and talking about serious stuff. We all know that the serious stuff is there and we're not afraid of facing it. In fact we know that it feels good to talk about it and get it out...I find that in many instances I **prefer** people who have struggled and are "in recovery" because they are often genuine humble sensitive to others caring and compassionate...Hard to find a better cohort than a Group of Drunks!!
I'm glad you've found a good group to hang out with! That was one thing that really helped me on my last long run was finally finding a group I enjoyed spending time with outside the rooms. I should look for a new one cause I miss that now. Anyway I hope you have a good day today triplet. Take. Are and IWNDWYT
