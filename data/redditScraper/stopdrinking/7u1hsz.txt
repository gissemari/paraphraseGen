So it turns out a major trigger for me to want to  drink is a storm day. We are getting a major winter storm and I am having a very strong craving. Might be the strongest one since stopping. I cannot give up now I have come too far. My addiction is lying to me by saying "only one or two" and "it would just be sooooooo nice  and cozy to sit back with a drink and listen to the wind and snow." ..Also it is very likely my husband will get storm stayed at work tonight so that is one more source of stress. (3 young kids by myself) ..Just posting to get it out and check back to remind myself that I actually do not want a drink...Thanks for listening

Pssst.... I believe in you.
Triggers!! grrrr. I have a weather trigger too!only mine is when it's nice and clear and sunny outside. I struggled this weekend for sure. But ultimately after the powerful urge passed I was so happy that I didn't give in. Especially hard since my drinking buddy (fianc ) was indulging all weekend. ..You can do this! Maybe some super indulgent hot chocolate instead? Good luck. Hugs 
It's great that you can recognize this as a trigger and vocalizing it to keep yourself accountable. You can do this! 
Thanks everyone. Good advice on a cup of hot chocolate. Very soothing and no regret or shame attached!!
