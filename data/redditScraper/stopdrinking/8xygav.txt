Hang in there friend. Sorry I don't have anything helpful to say (it's my bedtime after a long day) but you're not alone.  IWNDWYT (or tomorrow either since today is finally over :P)..Hang in there. You know you can do it. Night friend.
Sorry to hear about your struggle...Something that helped me was going to a recovery meeting and just listening...Being around people who understand pulls me off the edge...Tried a meeting?
Lots of us here can't do it alone. Do you have someone to talk to? Therapy and meetings are valuable tools. My brain was in a dark place after 20 years of heavy drinking. Alcoholism causes anxiety and depression. I have broken free but it took a lot of work. If I did it you can do it.
Hang in there.  Find an AA meeting if you can.  That is what saved my ass. 
Big hug fizgig!!!  I wish I could tell you the answer to the meaning of life because in these existential crises moments I think it would SURE COME IN HANDY TO KNOW.  But life doesn't come with rules.  It doesn't come with instructions.  For that we have our heart.  I think when shit hits the fan and everything goes haywire or we are just goddamn tired I think we have an inkling inside our heart.  I don't believe I've ever been in a situation or had an idea where I did not have that reliable twinge of  this is right' or  this ain't good Fish'.  Unless I drowned it in booze.  Can you hear it?  Sometimes I need to be quiet for a bit to hear it.  I'm sending huge love over to you whoever you are friend.  Huge love.. big love!         I wish you all my best.  I'm not drinking with you today let's do it together 
Hey I think you need to talk to some people.  Are there any meetings in your area?  You don't have to feel alone in this battle.  There are a lot of us that feel the way you do.  It takes hard work HARD work to change things in our lives but you can start small.  Small steps first get a rhythm and then add more positive changes.  You will be okay just take some time to love yourself collect your thoughts and make a few plans to feel better. Think of simple things like stretching or a small art project you can work on in the evenings or even deep cleaning your home.  Having things to do and things to take your mind off everything else helps.  But again if you can try to find a meeting that way you can share some of these frustrations with others.
Fizgig79 really sorry you are struggling and feel like you are drowning. I don't have any advice just wanted to write and say well sorry it's a hard patch for you. Hope it gets better Polthier
Stay strong. This cacophony in your head is not unusual. It's because we're all so smart passionate and creative right? ..You SD pals here got it right: sharing with others in recovery is a great idea. I was told once a long time ago that in emergencies like what you're experiencing you just hang on for dear life and yell for help. You're doing it right!..Good luck!
It's just better on the other side. It is a struggle but as the days go on you struggle less and less because instead of dealing with problems alcohol keeps hurling at you you just deal with normal life stuff. You still have to get up go to work pay bills whatever. But you're doing it without a 400 pound gorilla strapped to your ass. When you're not drinking up all your money  you actually HAVE money.  It's a miracle.  One of the few I've noticed in my life. Glad you're here.  I wish I'd stopped drinking sooner like everyone does. IWNDWYT 
I just read your"rant". You are female.  Me too. I normally keep my posts pretty gender neutral because.we are all suffering in similar ways but there are some things that hit women a little differently. I am 59. And it's important that I move into this next phase of my life with a little grace and not as a drunk it's tacky. At 59 Im still a vain twit  it matters if my face is bloated my manicure is peeling and when I put on my clothes I look like 10 pounds of shit in a 5 pound sack. It matters if the home I worked so hard to buy on my own is unkempt.  It matters that my two adult daughters might have to look at me with pity and talk between themselves about what's going to happen to mom. It matters because I've gotten this far in liferaised a family provided for them and myself largely on my own and I will be damned if all the work and toil I've put in over the years are going to count for nothing.  It doesn't matter if I have 5 years left on this planet or 25. Time to make the most of them and go get my roots done...
