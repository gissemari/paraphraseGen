I got out of work today and felt happy. I gave a good presentation. My girlfriend is drinking with her friends. I'm here trying to not drink the handle of vodka in my freezer (my roommates and I shared it before I decided to stop). ..Life sucks now man. I miss the days of blissful numbness. Anyone able to tell me that feeling this terrible is better than being euphoric? I dont mean to sound preachy or whiney. Just new at this and struggling. ODAAT

The euphoria from drinking is very temporary and will lead to feeling terrible the next day and then there's also the guilt. ..Most of us have been steady drinkers increasing our consumption and I for one was a daily drinker. I drank everyday for around 10 years. It gets old and very tiring. So my suggestion is why not try sobriety for a while? What have to got to lose? We all know how the drinking makes us ultimately feel why night try the other side of the coin? Even if it means a week of feeling uncomfortable. 
I had to find a replacement for that feeling.  ...I started training for a half marathon late this year.  .Bit by bit I'm getting there.  ...It takes me completely out of myself. Just like I need.
Can you make a plan right now while you are battling cravings to treat yourself tomorrow? Like plan to get up early and go to breakfast at a nice cafe or something similar? That's one of the main things I do to stop myself when the hankering for booze starts in the evenings. It's every evening for me too. I really sympathize with how you are feeling right now. It sounds like you had a good day though. I hope you can hold onto those happy feelings without too much FOMO. ..IWNDWYT..&amp;#x200B;
That brief euphoric feeling is nothing compared to the long-term feeling of sustainable contentment relief and happiness you can achieve all the time with sobriety. Try it! You might like it.
