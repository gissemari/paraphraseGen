I'm not an alcoholic and I saw that saying this  doesn't break guidelines I think. So I wanted to say to the people who are helping in this sub even mods thank for helping people having trouble with alcohol. You guys give me hope in humanity. So thank you for that and to the people struggling and helping others I wish you luck and an amazing life!
