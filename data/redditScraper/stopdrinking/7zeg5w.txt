Broke up with my boyfriend headed straight to the liquor store.  Managed to drink a pint of vodka and 3 beers.  Not nearly as much as I would normally drink so there's that but fuckity fuck fuck! Now I've still got to deal with the heartbreak.

I wished you had more sobriety under your belt before this happened. I feel like it would have helped you get through this situation without alcohol. Best of luck to you. It's just one day at a time.

You still came back here.  New day new decisions....IWNDWYT. 
Well said there s that but fuckety fuck too. Sorry about your troubles. You have done well so far proven that you can do it. I ll shed a tear with you but I will not drink with you. Wish you all the best.
A pint of vodka ? Is that something people drink.. without a mixer?
I'm so sorry.  Get back on horse and ride.  I slipped up too.  But self-compassion is not letting it weigh me down.  IWNDWYT 
Yes. Dealing with feelings is difficult but healthy... I know that I make much better choices when I'm clear headed..I'm sorry for your breakup. That is difficult...Best of luck. IWNDWYT.
I mixed it with soda water.
