A thousand days. Thank you all for all the support I've gotten here at r/stopdrinking. It's an amazingly positive and supportive place. ..To anyone struggling to get started and maybe having to start over several times like I did just keep trying. Keep thinking of how good it might feel to be sober after a month or two or a whole year. You can have it. Go and take it. ..As I've said here many times my streak is not inspired by seeing these big numbers. I get inspired by the people who come back and reset to 1 fell down but still try it all over again. That's where I think the hardest work is happening here at SD. Let's keep it going!

Congrats on **1000**!
It now reads 1001 which is a sweet palindrome! I agree about the inspiration from those who fall but don't fail. It is a very courageous act to return &amp; admit a fall. Stay strong &amp; Sober on! Peace
Wow!   Superstar!
