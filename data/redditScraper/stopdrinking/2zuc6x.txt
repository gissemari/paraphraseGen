I'm working on closing out my 2nd day and I am on the see saw of saying yes and no to getting a drink. After I finish the function I'm at right now I am going to have coffee with my girlfriend. I keep in my mind saying that I can get a drink and no one would be the wiser except for me. And that's what stopping me. I am going to stay strong and remain vigilant but I just needed to share. This is the time I turn my life around and quit gambling on how my life will turn out if I have one more drink. Its not worth it.

Stay strong you got this!..Not sure if your girlfriend is aware of your struggle or your new direction but hopefully she is supportive. It's tough to do alone for sure this sub is fucking awesome.
Stick it out. Not long to go before comfy bed and then Day 3.
In those early days I had to ask myself why I wanted to drink and really make myself come up with a reason. Most of the time it was to forget to avoid to feel less or feel more. ..When I figured out what the motivation was I came on here and talked or went to a meeting. Facing our demons is tough stuff but I figured if I wanted a better life I must start making better choices. ..I hope you stuck with coffee.
You can do it! Life is bett err when you are present and safe
