Hi all..After a very bad relapse last week I'm looking to find a good group to join in the Lakewood area. If the last week taught me anything it's that this has gone to the point where there's no way I can keep myself sober on my own. I'm not religious so really hoping there's a agnostic AA group or something like that. I was going to post this in r/sdcolorado but they don't appear to be very active...Thanks in advance for any recommendations!

I'm not in Colorado but even if you don't find an agnostic group you may be pleasantly surprised to discover that not everyone in AA is religious and that some people even talk about that without judgment at meetings.  I'm an atheist and I've attended meetings for over three years without being converted. :)  A thought:  meetings that advertise as LGBT-friendly are often quite tolerant of religious diversity as well even if they aren't labeled as such.  I hope you find a meeting that works for you!
Hello!.I have heard of some good ones in your area!  West Pines (Wheatridge) has meetings including LifeRing.  Also if you want to go just a little out of Lakewood there is LifeRing on Blake St (LoDO).  That's a really good group.  .I've had good luck with LiferingColorado.org.  .I hope that helps!  I know some folks in Lakewood but they usually come to Denver (one guys rides his bike!).  I hope to see you around..
