I think I need to add daily reminders to my sobriety tracker. I have been able to make it fine for the first weeks to months of quitting drinking but constantly relapse... I just hate the embarrassment shame and risky situations I put myself in. I think I need to write a daily reminder down evwry single day so I don't forget in 2 months .....I'm  thinking about the following but curious if anyone else has good ones:..I can NOT control this!.One drink ALWAYS leads to more. I become comfortable with drinking and think I am in control... Which always leads to dangerous binges. I can NOT have just one...

One drink is too much and a hundred isn't enough
