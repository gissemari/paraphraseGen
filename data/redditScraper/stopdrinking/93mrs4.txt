Hi SD family..Today is my 6 months anniversary. 6 months and 1 day ago I was having the worst day of my whole life and my severe binge drinking habit that I had been harbouring for some years had turned into a full on addiction in the previous year. ..I was tired ashamed ridden with self hatred guilt and anxiety. My career was in the toilet and all of my relationships were broken including the one with my boyfriend and no one including myself could recognise who I had become. ..Fast forward to now after 6 months of sobriety and ALOT of anxiety therapy my life is so drastically different in all of the ways I listed each one in an amazingly positive way. Most of all my relationship with my boyfriend is the best it has ever been and I have started to get my self respect back. ..Giving up drinking when it has been your emotional crutch is hell as you all know. ..There are no words to describe how much my daily check of SD has helped me the support we provided each other on this global online family continues to astound me. ..To anyone who is struggling to not drink today you can do this take it from me. One day at a time...Big love to you all and thank you for everything..Lucy x...
