Ignore my badge need to reset it. Guess who started drinking again a while back and arrived at the exact same conclusion: that drinking alone every night until you surpass oblivion is no way to live. If you guessed me you're right. I've got 8 days under my belt today and this is really the first day so far I've wanted to have a drink so I'm posting here to kind of think out loud and remind myself why I re started sobriety anyways. I'm rereading This Naked Mind and it's just as good the second time. I have Alcohol Explained coming soon in the mail. I've been reading here everyday and eating lots of junk food and fizzy water to keep my hand to mouth habit occupied. I just feel like I'm treading water still. I know it's early on so I'm trying to be patient. The longest I've made it in the past few years was 12 or 13 days. I wanna double that this time and hopefully just keep chugging away. I'm tired of waking up half dead and smelling like booze till noon. I've got some life changes coming in the next few months and it's pretty imperative that I don't drink so they go as smoothly as possible. Thanks to you all for sharing your struggles and successes it's nice to know I'm not the only one. IWNDWYT
