In /u/slipacre's prison post this week he wrote about the guys talking about complacency. This really spoke to me. In my work we talk about the addiction cycle --> pre-contemplation (nothing's wrong) --> contemplation (maybe I've got a problem) --> preparation (maybe I should do something about it) --> action (quitting detox rehab) --> maintenance (AA therapy other strategies) --> relapse.  ..I think that *relapse has its own cycle* and it starts with maintenance complacency which leads to contemplation (well maybe I don't have a problem anymore or one drink wouldn't hurt) --> planning -- *can be unconcscious!* (next time I'm offered I'll just have one) --> action (drank the one...or twelve) --> maintenance (one day a week becomes five becomes a blackout or whatever pattern establishes)...I see this frequently tested in newbies once the pink cloud has worn off because it can take awhile to see the long-term benefits of sobriety and recovery. But it's not limited to them; I personally can attest to that.  And a lot of people don't ever get to the recovery part either they think that sobriety is enough.  ***No judgment here; just observation.*** ..In fact in my previous sobriety of over 11 years that was me.  I quit drinking. Period. I look back now and I see the relapse cycle.  It started months before my relapse.  "Sniffing" a glass of the $100 bottle of wine my husband ordered at dinner (we weren't paying!). Then at a campout with friends someone set up the Jed Smith Bar pouring top shelf tequila.  I sat down to have a conversation with "the bartender" and said "Oh pour me a shot of that." He looked at me funny because he knew I didn't drink but he did it.  I had another and went to my tent feeling righteous -- *see that wasn't so bad; you can do this*. ..It started out slowly -- a drink here or there; a glass of wine at the holiday party.  But it didn't stay slow. The clue was that regardless of how much I did or didn't drink my days became managed by alcohol -- *was I going to drink? What was I going to drink? What did I have to do at work tomorrow; how much could I drink and have a brain?*..Recovery is a practice a daily one.  But it's tricky because if I approach it like a "forever" thing I could give up quickly.  I like double IPAs. I like good wine.  I like tequila.  I will probably always like those (I wish I was someone for whom the taste of alcohol upon quitting became lighting fluid).  ..So I choose to practice my discipline.  It has to be as conscious a decision today as it was yesterday.  If I cannot **wholeheartedly** commit to myself that I will not drink today I need to consider whether I am entertaining - consciously or unconsciously - the possibility of relapse...Today I won't drink.
