As I approach my 30 days I have been looking at what has been successful and where I feel I need improvement in this journey. .One of the biggest thing I need is sober friends. I did 7 days in a really amazing rehab program in Calistoga. It was a short stay but it was a great program that kicked my recovery into gear.  It was an eye opening experience. I was surrounded by people who though felt and struggled just like me. You spend pretty much 8 hours a day working on programs to help you recover. It was funny because it felt like a expensive sober summer camp. I am slowly becoming more comfortable in my local AA meetings. I just can't wait until I have someone I can talk to often about the ups and downs of getting sober. People who are recovering are the most friendly and caring people. Its really amazing to see this. I will also keep posting here more often as I am finding this sub to be very helpful. Keep up the good work SD and I will see you bright and early with a clear mind in the morning!

That's great! Thank you for posting. The first 28 days are the foundation of our sobriety. it makes me happy to see this and reminds me to stay active in recovery mode. I needed that.
I am sure that there are a number of newcomers in those meetings that feel the same way you do. We used to go for coffee or a meal after the meetings. maybe you could ask a few people if they would like to do that. Could turn into a regular thing. One meeting I used to go to two thirds of the meeting would go down to the local diner and eat/fellowship make plans for other activities. Also Getting a sponsor to talk with would also be helpful. Congrats on your 28 days :-) What a nice beginning :)
Great post. I'm getting ready to head to an AA meeting myself and totally agree with you about the friendly caring people.
