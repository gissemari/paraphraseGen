I can't tell you how ridiculously excited I was to log in this morning and see that first star. I know it won't change for another 30 days but that's fine. This is the longest I've gone without drinking in more years than I can remember. I couldn't have done it without the support stories and advice I've gotten here. I think we should all be so proud of the victories we have over drinking -- whether they're in days months or years. They're all a struggle. Thanks for being here!!

&gt; I think we should all be so proud of the victories we have over drinking -- whether they're in days months or years...Honestly logging on here in the first place is what I'm most proud of.  Those first moments those first days... that can be harder than what most people ever go through in their lives.  Congrats on the well-earned star and I won't drink with you today!
Congrats that's awesome! Can't wait until I get mine either! 
Congrats. 30 days is huge!
It's the only time I use a desktop to see those monthly stars well done on yours it's a brilliant achievement 
Congrats Judy you're a STAR!!!
That promise of that star keeps me going some hours! I'm really excited for next week yet trying to focus on one day at a time. I've been lurking a bit on and off today and I think I'm at my best when I'm interacting more on this page. Thanks for giving me an easy comment opportunity and reaffirming my motivation! IWNDWYT.
Congrats ..IWNDWYT 
How do you see your stars?
