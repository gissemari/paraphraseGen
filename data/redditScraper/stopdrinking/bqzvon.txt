Happy Monday Everyone..My brother (31) and I (27) have been big drinkers our whole lives. Over the years I have severely reduced my intake because it was negatively affecting my health and mood. However my brother switches between moderate drinking and severe drinking every few weeks. He has always done this but I'm worried that the severe drinking periods are becoming more severe. ..We threw a party yesterday and he was much drunker than he should have been considering what we drank. He was slurring badly and falling over he could barely keep from passing out despite yelling about some incoherent story. He confided in me in his stupor that he had drank five shots before he came to the party (which started at 2 pm). I think it was even more than that if I had to guess...My brother is a good guy and one of my closest friends and I hate to see him like this. He knows it's a problem but has always struggled with being sober. He has diagnosed anxiety and I think if he would consistently see a doctor that they would uncover something even more problematic. He doesn't want to commit to a doctor for this either out of fear or depression. He does take anxiety medicine (for about six months now) which he says helps but his drinking is worse than ever...I really just want to help him be healthier. He looks like a seasoned drinker all of a sudden and his mood is becoming more and more erratic. I'm worried that this is going to kill him either by disease or drunken stupidity. I am thinking of offering to go cold turkey with him but I think even if he agreed he would just lie to me about it. He knows I want to help but it's scary for him and I get that. He also lives thirty minutes from me so I can't really dedicate the time to see him that often...I guess I'm mostly airing out my thoughts but any advice or anecdotes are really appreciated.

In my experience he's got to want it and not much outside influence will help. Something had to click for me. It wasn't my worst drinking moment but the sum of the parts was my rock bottom. I have not had a drink since. I need therapy and AA to remain in recovery. ..Everyone I know in recovery needed somewhat of a  beating  to get serious about sobriety but lots of people can and do get off earlier than others on that elevator to hell. ..I guess just being honest about your care for him is a good olive branch but would advise against any accusation or intervention without professional consultation. ..r/AlAnon would have a lot of help on the topic too.
My first bit of advice would be therapy for him. Most people are already familiar with this but antidepressants mixed with alcohol is a dangerous combo and increases your susceptibility to alcohol/affects of drinking. I recently quit drinking because I felt my mental health was in a really bad place and I no longer knew what was natural and was being acerbated by my drinking. If he's taking medication but not seeing a therapist I think it would be a great idea for him to start and it could be framed around his anxiety rather than his drinking but hopefully the therapy would help both. Therapy has really changed my life for the absolute better!  ...Secondly this is kinda related and kinda not. My family has no idea how much I really drink....but my mom will often confide in me how scared she is by the amount that my older sister drinks (we are similar in age to you and your brother actually). I think you could categorize me as a "high functioning" alcoholic or in other words I can hide it better than my sister does. Part of me getting sober was that I felt like a hypocrite during these conversations with my mom. I'm hoping that by getting sober and quitting drinking my sister/family can see me as an example and it'll begin a conversation about healthy relationships with alcohol (which are nonexistent at the moment despite lots of alcoholism in my family). I was the first in my family to seek out therapy/medication for depression and became the unofficial go-to person for advice in that realm. Now I hope the same will happen for addiction.   ...If you're willing to do so maybe you could be a similar example for your brother. You could quit cold turkey or just abstain from drinking around him. Invite him to non-drinking activities. Open AA meetings allow family and friends to attend. Maybe he could tag along with you!   ...Also - I know in this subreddit we are supposed to abstain from saying "you" statements. Apologies about that - I don't know how to rephrase to communicate this advice.
