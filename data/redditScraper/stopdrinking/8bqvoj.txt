have been busy at work the last few days and havent had a chance to be on here much. it occurred to me this morning that i should not let that become the new norm because you guys help me remember why im doing what im doing and how to do it...coincidentally im at 30 days today (badge is one day off). been here before but not too many times. ..also i realized that for me feeling "fat" is a big trigger. i have struggled with messed up body image and phases of disordered eating/obsessive weighing etc since high school. in the last 2 months i started a new desk job after almost a year at a restaurant job so i move less and have been lax about food since i quit drinking. ive put on a few pounds and am feeling gross. i realized that in the past i have reacted to this feeling by getting blackout drunk so i wouldnt have to feel it anymore or at least could "forget about" it for a while. now i have to sit thru it...and as far as the weight itself i am trying to take the longview and hope that overall not drinking will payoff in terms of health and fitness.

Oh yeah. "Feeling fat" is a total trigger for me. So a glass of wine (or 234 etc.) magically made that feeling go away...Of course hard cold reality is that the alcohol contributes to the fat fat makes me feel gross drinking eases that feeling. Lather rinse repeat...In the shallow end of the pool here but wanting to lose weight is my big motivation for quitting alcohol this time. Of course blackouts money liver health etc. are almost as important. jk..I'm patiently waiting for the fat to magically melt away since I'm not drinking. Hasn't happened yet but I'm telling myself at least I'm not gaining by drinking too much...Hey we are both at the same number of days- we must be linked lol. Hang in there and hopefully we will feel better and better!
