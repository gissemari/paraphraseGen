I relapsed yesterday after a fight with my boyfriend. Everything is ok now and I have no plans to use again but I was surprised at how much I disliked the experience of drinking. I used to find it fun and that's how I released my emotions but last night it just made me feel a bit sick and quite tired. I didn't get that old happy feeling at the first few drinks and I almost gagged at the taste. This just reinforced my desire to stay sober. That and the hangover today. I'm wondering if this is something anyone else has experienced and if perhaps this is a dangerous attitude to have as it may be a short hop from here to complacency. Any thoughts welcome!!

I relapsed multiple times before it stuck this time around.  I had multiple 6-8 months sober stretches.  What I realized each time I relapsed is that it was never fun the way I remembered it the way I thought it would go it never did.  Also each time I relapsed I always regretted it.  So now I know that and it keeps me from relapsing.  
Yeah id call it almost unsatisfying but now I question why I expected a relapse to be satisfying! I'm definitely going to use this experience to help me keep going - thanks.
