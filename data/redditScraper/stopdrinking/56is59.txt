I just recently spent 11 days in a treatment facility to detox and learn a ton about myself. I've been sober for just under two weeks and I'm feeling great. I'm struggling to find a place that I can watch football (no cable at my house). I know I can go to the local watering hole and not drink but what's the point. Keep thinking of the old saying; "Why go to the barbershop if you don't want a haircut"...Looking for suggestions thanks everyone!!

Local ymca's sometimes have a lobby with a tv for football. Hotel lobbys sometimes have a tv with the game on. If you dress fairly decently they would never check to see if you were a guest. I am sure a few other places as well. 
Our local bowling alley shows the games. Sometimes I sit out by the lanes watch people bowl and catch the game at the same time. Alcohol is served but it doesn't feel like a bar (lots of families etc) -- there's lots more going on besides drinking. I get nachos and seltzer (I love crappy snack bar food).
