Yesterday and today were particularly hard. I've quit for about 11 days and the first 9 were pretty easy. Yesterday the active chat got me through...Today I nearly gave in until I thought to myself  you made a New Years resolution to last at LEAST a month don't quit in only 11 days... . I did have some potato chips and bread though! But that still beats the thousands of calories one night of drinking would bring!..Cheers to not drinking today!

Awesome! You made it. Xo
Hey im sure today is easier and you're grateful you got through yesterday. thats how its done. good job and hit your goal.
Something that helped me is realizing I don't have to feel good every day. Maybe it seems obvious. But even on my sober birthdays I didn't always feel great...But now I can just feel bad plain and simple. And I don't have to destroy my body over it you know? I can go to bed sober and wake up and it's a new day...Maybe that helps. The first 90 days are tough but I know you'll make it. IWNDWYT
