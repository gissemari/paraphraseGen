Yesterday went so well thanks to the support of friends and my husband. Now it's Friday and I'm struggling to rewire my brain from "oh goodie boss leaves early I can go to lunch and start drinking until bedtime". We went to the grocery store last night and got lots of tasty non-alcoholic drinks - tea juice energy drinks etc.  I jokingly told him "diet coke tastes weird" since 99% of the time I drank it was with vodka. It was really nice to not have a headache in the afternoon though the evening was uncomfortable - my stomach was upset my head pounded and my hands shook. I had a hard time falling asleep....But man when I woke up today I was PROUD. I just don't need that shit. I've always been a firm believer that "success begets success" so hopefully I can keep adding more healthy habits to my list - I'm wary of exchanging drinking for overeating....To all of you here thank you for who you are and what you do. It means the WORLD to me to know I'm not alone.

Congratulations on day two!
Congrats!!!  Nice job!!
&gt; I was PROUD..Right on! You should be proud great job. I hear you about the overeating too. Once you're comfortable with it try adding walks to your daily routine. I always found that after a walk it helped reduce the urge to drink a lot because I didn't want to ruin the progress made by walking. Give it a shot!
