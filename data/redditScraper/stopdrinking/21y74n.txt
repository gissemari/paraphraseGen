I'm going good on Day 37 (woohoo). I have to say that the first few weeks of sobriety were easier than it has been the last week or so. It is truly sinking in how permanent of a life change this is-regardless of whether or not it was a willed decision. I've been throwing myself into physically cleaning up my life in ways of health and general clutter. It's really the first burst of energy I've had since I quit drinking. I am struggling a little bit though. It is kind of like my support has broken down the slightest bit and it feels like a lot. My two main sources of support (boyfriend and best friend) have a lot on their own plates right now. I also think that they don't necessarily understand how this all feels. Anyways I don't make a lot of sense but my mind is jumbled right now. Thanks for reading.

There are an awful lot of people who do understand how this all feels.  It is hard on your own but it is a bit easier with people who understand.  Congrats on your 37 days.
I can totally relate. My wife has been great my other family not so much. ..I'm dealing with feeling crazy - the last few days have been awful. I'm seeing an addictions counselor AA working the program. It's working but I'm terrified of life feelings and God letting me down. ..But that's how I feel - not how it is. I'm getting better and I'm going to boot fuck alcohol and this awful disease. ..Keep posting - it helps the whole community. 
Good for your 37 days. Glad you're here to get more support. It was super-helpful to me in the first few months particularly. I had no SO support but did have counseling and some sober friends as well. Do you have plans so that you don't feel unsupported if your BF and friend can't help?
Congrats on your good start /u/caddyre.
