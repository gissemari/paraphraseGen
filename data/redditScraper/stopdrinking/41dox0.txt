Today I woke up feeling so much guilt and shame for relapsing. I wanted to reach out for support on here and also let you all know what happened so that YOU can avoid this mistake. ..My first year of recovery I was fully committed. I had a sponsor went to meetings everyday worked the steps etc. After my one year anniversary I started to get a little more "lazy"... I would skip meetings here and there slowed down with my stepwork called my sponsor less and became silent in my meetings. I stopped sharing about what was really going on and pretended that everything was perfect...I managed to stay sober this way for a full year (but let me tell you it was horrible). Then after my two year anniversary things got worse. I started hanging out with old toxic friends I engaged in risky behavior I stopped calling my sponsor my stepwork went to a dead stop and I only went to one meeting a week. I was silent. I never reached out. I kept my obsessive thoughts of drinking to myself. I was pretty much a ticking time bomb. ..Fast-forward to two days ago - I finally gave in. I recently turned 21 so I ordered drinks at a bar and ended up stealing some of my friends vicodine later on. ..I still can't believe this happened. ..I don't know what I am asking for - maybe support or words of encouragement or advice? Either way I feel really stuck today. I am totally terrified to tell anyone because I don't want to let my family down. I have worked so hard to regain their trust over these past two years and I am so scared to mess that up. ..Thank you for holding this space for me and thank you for letting me share. I am so grateful to have found this community.

So if you look back at the past 2.51 years you've been clean all but 2 days of it?  Focus on that and focus on taking the consistent appropriate actions that stave off the demons that convince you to take that first drink/drug.  You know what you stopped doing that led to using.  Get back to doing what kept you sober/happy previously (year 1 as you describe it) and add to it/change it up as necessary (you'll know when it's necessary) trust me.  It'll be OK just start and keep doing the next right thing.
Congratulations on choosing not to drink today. That's really all you have to do - don't drink. Please remember that relapsing is *very* *very* common. Let's not drink today! Together!
Hang in there! You can do this!..I'm sorry to say that I can relate to this. I also thought I had the recovery covered by managing to be sober - for a while. After some time my drinking-brain convinced me that I was "fine" and that "one drink wouldn't hurt". I'm sure you know what happened next. I got terribly drunk did stupid stuff and woke up with a hangover and a deep sense of shame. But you know what I did afterwards? I startet a new sober journey. It's slow-going and boring but the alternative is worse.
I'm really impressed that you reached out so early. That's a great sign! Some people don't get back on the wagon for a long time after a relapse. You being here is very encouraging to us all. If I relapse I hope I have the strength to pull back from the brink as well and be like you. 
Hey we all screw up on the journey of sobriety. The question is do you learn from the mistake and start again? Looks like you have...Just stay the hell away from opiates and people who abuse them. I've had too many friends get addicted and switch to heroin when hydrocodone got too expensive. We actually have a nationwide heroin problem growing because of prescription drug abuse. If you think drinking is destructive and hard to quit...
900+ days of sobriety haven't been thrown away only 1 has.  I can only imagine that the next few days might be tough for you but you're not back at rock-bottom again.  Get back on that horse and go!
Welcome back I am very glad the slide did not turn into a train wreck involving toxic chemicals while falling great distances into a volcano - (as we both have both heard told in AA)..You know what to do you will be hugged not scorned when you return tail between you legs to the rooms (especially if you - as you did here - own the mis-steps that sent you tumbling down the path.)..I was particularly taken with your description of the "horrible" year spent sober but on the outside of the program.  Connect. It's hard especially if the room is filled with old farts like me but ultimately it is the much easier safer path...
I'm sorry this happened. Relapse starts before we pick up the drink. I'd take a look at the months preceding and ask myself when it started. You were sober several years; be proud! You haven't really lost that time. It's still yours. Thank you for the honest post. 
Hey people make mistakes. A lot of them. All of us. It's OK and mistakes are a great place to learn from. We can't change what has happened but what can be done is deciding what we do today and since you are here and posting it appears to me you want to stay sober. So what if you had a relapse it still doesn't take away the 2 and a half years (major!!) that you were sober. That two and a half years is there proving you you can do it it was you who was sober you did it yourself; and you can use this opportunity to learn how to stay there. Thanks for sharing your story and keep posting!
People think they become lazy and not commited to be sober because they skipped meetings...No you skipped meetings because YOU became "lazy". Meetings are not miracle. The percentage of people who manage to stay sober without AA is the same of people with AA. It's all about you.
You didn't throw away 2.5 years. Did you go back in time and drink for those years? No. You were still sober for 2.5 years that didn't change. And that is a wonderful thing. Keep on keepin' on :)
In my experience I can say you have to remember that every day is a challenge. If it seems like the addiction is easing up its usually just in the back of your head. You cannot forget that you have to live up to that challenge every day or it sneaks up on you. EDIT: Oh and thanks for sharing!
It's impressive that you are immediately back here on SD and considering what this stumbling block you just tripped over means...I bascially second /u/HideAndSeek's reply and would also say to just focus on today. You're not "starting over" you just had a snag! Don't let it get you down.
Just remember that you're only human. You fucked up but you posted here about getting back on the wagon which shows that you still want it. Keep your head in the game and whenever it's noticeable that you're getting lazy on it get back into it. The best quote I've heard about exercising is "The hardest part about going on a run is putting your shoes on." Getting the motivation to go for that first run again is the hardest part. Once you're back at it it's so much easier. Get those shoes on and get back at it. One love. 
This is exactly what this song is about. Same amount of time sober after relapse too. Idk if you like Macklemore but i find this song to be inspiring. Hang in there you got this. Starting Over- Macklemore (sorry i cant make the link fancy im on mobile)..https://youtu.be/rXVaq7EdZ7M
Always remember those previous days are never lost; you gained valuable experience and insight into your own personal condition and what was working for you...Someone else put it this way....think of it as a journey from New York to California. You get a flat tire. You don't go back to New York and start all over.
I feel like you posted this for me!  I'm almost 2 1/2 years sober. The first year was great I worked my ass off went to a ton of meetings and worked with a sponsor. 2nd year I had a baby and meetings became rare about one or two a week and just the occasional call to my sponsor. Now I'm in grad school I have a 14 month old and my life is crazy busy. Meetings are 2-3 X's a month and I talk to my sponsor sporadically. I've been having thoughts of drinking when I'm stressed. I justify my lack of involvement in AA. I think it's time to reevaluate my priorities and make some adjustments.  Thank you for your honesty. .I think you will find nothing but love and support of you go back to your home group and open up. Hugs to you. 
I think it's incredible that you have this much focus on getting better at 21.  ...I wasn't even close to acknowledging my problem let alone treating it at 21. ...Glad you're back.   
The fact that you're here telling your story is the difference between the you of 2.5+ years ago and the you of today. You wouldn't be here if you didn't care. Caring is half the battle...I have a sort of personal mantra that I repeat at least once a day to myself when I start beating myself up over whatever the problem du jour is:..I am human..I am not perfect..I will make mistakes..I will do some things badly..I will do some bad things..I am normal..Making mistakes and failure is how I learn..I have worth just as I am..
My relapse cost me my family job home and well I ended up one day under a freeway over pass wondering WTF happened. .I had to pick my self up and dust off the dirt and get back into what worked. 17 years later I am still trudging this happy road :). God bless you and good luck. You can do it One day at a time.
You are an inspiration. Thank you for your post keep trying. You've already come so far.
Relapse happened very recently for me as well. For me I don't want to look back at my sobriety in remorse I want to take the things that benefited me. I'm having a lot of self-reflection and I'm still trying to figure out why and how I relapsed. I understand that I'm not perfect even the very best have "failed". These "failures" are just stepping stones to a better me.
I can totally recognize myself in the story of how you went back out a little at a time until there you were; that's how it was for me too.  It took me seven years to come back in.  So I certainly applaud your action in coming back here so soon.  This in no way negates the two and a half years (!); you still have a great foundation of things you've learned (again as evidenced by your prompt return).  Thank you for posting this.
I did something very similar in my first go around at sobriety. But instead of honesty I said "oh it was just a slip I don't have to tell anyone" yeah well I kept slipping and slipping until I was facing jail. Coming here and telling us must have been incredibly difficult but it is such a valuable lesson that we can't get complacent. Thank you for sharing.
I usually just lurk for the most part but your story really hit me. I have BEEN THERE. I quit drinking at the end of 2009 for the first time (I just turned 23) and went through almost the exact same series of events over a more condensed year and half before fucking up. I knew full well that not drinking was my only option for plenty of good reasons but I let it go anyway. ..I repeated the same pattern twice more generally because my depression became unmanageabley bad but also when I got complacent. This time around (serious attempt #4 I think) it took a fantastically awful 9 months the worst last drinking night ever and deteriorating health (annoying when you're 28 and a health nut) for me to be committed to doing this forever. I got a tattoo on my hand for fuck's sake...Not to make this all about me but my point is that you know how helpful sobriety can be and doable if you put in the work so don't make my same mistake of fucking up 3 or however many more times to remind yourself! It'll always suck and you'll always know you were better off sober and you'll wish you'd just stuck with that first shitty relapse. I felt that it was important to own up to drinking at a meeting (even a random one) or to a sober friend EVERY time but not necessarily to the whole world. Some well meaning people take it as an invitation to get you drunk again and would otherwise just keep thinking you're their sober friend and not tempt you. Be accountable but not to a self detrimental point and especially after you've earned a lot of sober days that didn't just evaporate because you messed up once...One more thing you're a badass for quitting so young. I know it's unspeakably difficult depending on your social scene but in a few years you're going to be that person who never made an ass of themselves at a party or fucked up your life because you were drunk; Trust me it gets a LOT less awkward when you're closer to 30 and realize you're the friend who has your shit together.
You did not throw anything away. Those sober days are good days that you should cherish. Start over. No big deal. Don't beat yourself up. Stop counting too.
This could pretty much be my story except it took me 10 years to get back to AA after I relapsed.  If I can offer any advice it's to not be like me and get back in the rooms ASAP.
I'm at day 3 after quite a good run at sobriety.  Man it f'ing sucks.  Good luck.
It could be so much worse.  I know that's kind of a cliche way to look at things but it's absolutely true.  You are 21 years old.  You've spent the last 2.5 years sober meaning you were 17.5 years old when you realized drinking had become a problem.  I give you so much credit for doing something about your problem early on in life.  Personally I did not get serious about addressing my drinking problem until I was 28.  Looking back the majority of my twenties have been wasted...  That's the pessimistic view.  Realistically and only as of recently I look at my twenties as a learning experience and am thankful for who I am today.  I've spent many days dwelling on past mistakes which ultimately left me feeling empty and regretful.  Now if/when I reflect on past mistakes I'm sure to identify the lesson(s) learned and move on with my day knowing I've learned something and will be better in the future because of it.  You need to do the same.  Identify the lessons you can learn from this mistake and move on...Tell your family you fucked up.  The fact they are a part of your life allows me to ascertain they deeply care about you.  Explain in detail the lessons you've learned from this mistake so they understand where you're at and to reiterate to yourself the important takeaways from this experience...The way you've outlined how you got to this point has me confident you've already identified your mistakes (becoming lazy with meetings bringing those toxic friends back into your life and engaging in risky behavior).  You're going to feel ba1d about relapsing it's human nature but follow up those bad feelings affirmations about how far you've come.  You have a problem with alcohol... despite that unfortunate fact you *still* managed to go 2.5 years without drinking!  That's fucking awesome!!!  You are a young person with a bright future.  Keep in mind your fate is not pre-determined.  The decisions you make today determine who future-you will be...Please let us know how things are going!
You saved your life by quitting 2.5 years.
I'm an alcoholic &amp; vicodin addict and I have to say 2.5 years is a very long time to go without relapsing. So I agree with what others have said for sure...For now just try to live one day at a time... you never stop doing that but it's a little more important to live this way right now than ever. Sometimes I almost forget how long I've been clean/sober just because I almost obsessively live that part of my life literally one day at a time. ..I wish you the best and hang in there don't worry so much about the relapse and just focus on staying clean/sober today and then tomorrow worry about tomorrow... etc etc :)
You were a lot more honest with yourself and us than I was -- sober for 9.5 years and then it took 5.5 to get me back here and to Day 17.  I like what /u/HideAndSeek/ said to you and I agree.  You know what it took for you to stay **fully** sober...*do that*.  No one ever told us this was going to be easy.  But the consequences of *not* doing it at least for me are strongly outweighed by the benefits *of* doing it.  "Through discipline comes freedom" someone once told me.  I believe that's true. Welcome back.
It sounds like AA really didn't work for you. You remained sober while in it (daily meetings a sponsor fully committed and doing the obligations they tell you to do fully and dedicatedly) - and you were also horribly miserable - for just over a year during this. ..With Smart Recovery and group therapy I've been able to be open and honest no matter what.  I don't have to go every day and moving on with my life and having other focuses is very encouraged.  ..Don't worry you are doing the right thing getting back on track now.  You have not "lost" all of those years sober and this is but a setback - it does not have to land you to "jails institutions and death." ..I hope this time around you are able to find a program that helps you. You know what they say: insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. 
You're human. It sounds like you have good perspective on what happened leading up to the slip and you're capable of good sobriety.  More than anything I want to thank you for sharing this and giving insight into what factors you think led to a drink.  I'm only six months in and am already flaking on meetings.  I'm also not calling my sponsor much (maybe once a week).  Sobriety just isn't as enjoyable when I'm not engaged with other people. ..Good job coming back so soon after the slip. Counting days and having goals is helpful but we need to be humble and realize that we might fall short of perfection sometimes in which case we can do "the next right thing." All we have is the 24 hours in front of us.  If I stay sober today that's good enough. 
Quote: "*If you're traveling cross country and your car breaks down do you scrap the trip and start over? No you fix it and keep going!*"..Every day counts! I relapsed after 1 1/2 years and also thought: "Well fuck it now I already relapsed so It doesn't matter if I'm going all in". It does because the **today** is important. ..It's already Monday here in Germany so I'll say: "Today I won't drink!". Join me if you want :)..P.S.: Awesome job coming back to us. I was too ashamed and selfish when my relapsed happened. Great decision. 
Sometimes we fall sometimes we trip (Multiple meanings unintentional but wtf) but the most important thing is not to let it drag you down and out.  .Sorry you slipped and welcome back.
I once relapsed after 5 months sober and my sponsor said something that helped me so much: "you didn't forget everything you've learned you just learned something didn't work."..I picked myself up after that &amp; celebrated 4 years sober this week. ..My relapse was a bump on the road not a drive off the cliff. It sounds like yours can be too. 
Welcome back.  I know it's not easy but learn from your mistakes and use this as an opportunity to grow.
I think it's important to recognize what leads up to a relapse - and then be more aware of those things going forward.  In order to change I must first be aware of what needs to be changed. ..I've found myself deep into a dry drunk before I ever saw it coming.  Thank God I didn't drink but I exhibited every other attitude I had when I was drinking.  That was an eye opener...The few times I've considered a drink were always in a 'bad situation' and my anger was in full bloom.  I'm fortunate to have remembered some of the basics - pick up the phone pray get my butt to a meeting and share what is happening.  ..The only thing you threw away was a starting date and now you have a new one.  Congratulations!  And you have gained some experience to carry forward into this sober journey.

I don't think I have any words of wisdom but 2.5 years is AMAZING. I'm proud of you and you should feel the same way! Oops you're human. You can do this. 
I have a very similar story. And while I'm "new" I also know that I learned so much through my sobriety and my relapses. I'm so glad you came back! It can be really hard to do. For me it took relapsing to really get honest about what was going on with me and I'm so grateful for that. Take care of yourself and don't beat yourself up too much. 
Mate you've done amazingly well...I really hope I can last as long as you did well done.
Thanks for the post it definitely helped others.  Besides having been sober for 2.5 years means you know you can do it again!  I've never been sober that long since I started just looking forward to 2 years in April.  You can do it.
For a 21 year old you sound super insightful. Please don't be hard on yourself you have achieved an amazing amount of sober time and should be proud of yourself. Thanks for sharing your story it really helps me someone who drank for 29 years...Thats longer than you've been ALIVE! I was a stupid slow learner. You've got a lot of life ahead of you.
Make sure you don't think of it as throwing something away. You gained a whole lot of experience so focused on what you've learned and move on. Relapsing never feels good but viewing it like this has helped me a lot. Good luck to you!
Your very young and should be proud of yourself there are not many people your age getting sober.  My out have nothing to be ashamed of.  I'm really proud of you.m I'm 45 and have never been 2 years sober in my life.  Thank you for sharing your story....
