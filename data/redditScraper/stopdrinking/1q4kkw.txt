I'm slowly swallowing the fact that I might be failing school again due to negligence and apathy. Big piles of due work and oh boy does the stress brings back the heavy urges to relapse both alcohol and tobacco. Feels like the first wall phase all over again. /rant

Have you every considered an evaluation for ADHD?.Check out the sidebar in /r/ADHD. 
Well one thing I know for sure is! That a drink will not solve your problems in fact I would venture to say it would compound them.  Make a list of things that you have to do and try to do them one thing at a time.  Start small and as you get better increase the list.  I wish you well.  Good Luck.
