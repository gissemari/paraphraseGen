It's been a hell of a thing. I've gotten through most of it white-knuckled and angry. This last month I've been going to meetings because I knew that there was just no way in hell I'd be able to keep doing it alone. The meetings are great. I ran in to an old friend who goes to NA and she offered to take me with her and I found that the atmosphere and general narrative were much more comfortable for me than in AA. ..After months of avoiding it I'm starting the step work. It's making me feel exactly as I did seven months ago the first night I decided I was done. Anxious and scared and sad and like I want to bash my face in to a brick wall. ..Sobriety is just for today. Recovery is a lifelong commitment. I can do today. Tomorrow is tomorrow's problem. ..Sobriety is just for today and I can white-knuckle through it and make it to the end of things and take a great big breath of relief when I make it out alive. I feel like I'm facing off against forever when it comes to doing the steps. Recovery is not just for today. Recovery is holding myself accountable for days I haven't lived yet. It's saying that I'm never going to fuck up again. I've got it all in order. I'm strong and I'll continue to be strong and I'll Do The Thing and find the patterns and identify the behaviors and once I've got it all examined and cataloged there's no chance I'll ever fuck up again. ..I am a fuck up. Fuck ups fuck up. It's our nature. ..I see the flawed logic (not that fuck ups fuck up that's pretty solid reasoning). I know I'm being irrational. What I know and what I ***feel*** are two very different things right now. ..I ***know*** that I need a program be it NA or AA. I can't keep managing without it. I  ***feel***  like the commitment is so stressful that I'm going to throw myself off a bridge. ..Facing forever makes me want to pretend I never made this choice and plunge right back in to drinking. It is safe. It is easy. It is comfortable. I am so god damn uncomfortable these days that bashing my own face in sounds preferable. The good news is that everyone at my old bar (where I worked for 3+ years so know everyone like family) knows about this journey and would completely ruin any relief of drinking with their concern so I absolutely couldn't return to that particular habit. The bad news is that I've planned my relapse around that having decided that I'll be a drunk that hides it instead. ..&amp;#x200B;..Planned my relapse. ..&amp;#x200B;..Jesus. ..&amp;#x200B;..IWDWYT hidden or otherwise. Fucking shit what a colossal unforgiving bitch of a thing this is.

It gets better. You are doing right by you. I am fortunate that there are a lot of meetings around where I live. Different meeting places different meeting times. A lot a opportunity to seek comfortable setting.  The focused meetings like the  Big Book study  or  12 x 12  are a better fit for me over the open free for all type. Some of the same people just a chance to work off some pages for a bit. I guess I am trying to say do some meeting shopping around talk to people after the meetings.  Get some phone numbers call the numbers or text. We take care of each other. It's really quite wonderful to find that comfort zone in sobriety. ..
Hey man it is difficult. But you're doing fantastic. 5 months is a long time. We all make poor choices but I wouldn't call yourself a fuck up. You're human. You're learning. And best of all you're here trying to better yourself...Keep going. 
Oh man.  What an array of emotions!  This reminded me very much of Russell Brand's book "Recovery".  While I know not everyone loves him I very much appreciated his perspective of the 12 step program and his use of the word Fuck.  He rambles but if you get it on audible he reads it and it makes a lot more sense.  ..Others have been where you are.  You are not alone.  You are worthy of recovery now and in the future.  Hang in there.  You are loved.  IWNDWYT
