I'm fairly new to Reddit and have just been bouncing around reading stuff all over when tonight I decided to search "drunk" looking for a subreddit about people helping others with their drinking...I've been struggling with my drinking for a few years now. I've always been a "weekend" drinker up until my gf and I got our own place. Then my social drinking and drinks after dinner basically turned into me pounding shots and beers the minute I got home from work. And this is how it was for years I'd have a solid buzz on by the time my gf got home from work and arguments would start. And on the days it wasn't completely obvious that I was drunk I'd keep drinking and some nights even worse arguments would start. ..Nights or a week of either me sleeping on the couch or her in the spare room would come and go and I'd take 357 days off from drinking but then I'd start right back up same stupid cycle. ..Then this past fall she had enough. One night after hours of drinking we had a blow up argument I said my usual cycle or awful things and that was that. She decided it was time for me to move out and that week was when it finally really hit me. And over that week I made a lot of progress for myself and for us and I managed to save a great relationship. I felt good about myself and us and she was happy and really saw a change in me and the amount of money I have saved from not spending $75-100 a week at the liquor store was great!..Then those weeks of being sober turned into a night here and there a few beers a glass of wine. But that wasn't enough and soon I was thinking how I could drink more and more but I'd tell myself "not so much you'd blow your cover"...And that's where I was tonight. I started to feel that good feeling slip away. Over Thanksgiving and the recent holidays I did drink I got drunk but there weren't any fights or blowups and in my head I felt myself telling myself "go ahead have a drink you've proven you can get drunk and not fight" and I was extremely close to going to get a few beers I have leftover in the fridge and chugging them as soon as my gf went to bed....but I decided to search for a subreddit like this and I'm happy I did...Reading some of the posts really made me snap out of it and get my mind back on the right path. I look forward to reading and sharing a lot here.
