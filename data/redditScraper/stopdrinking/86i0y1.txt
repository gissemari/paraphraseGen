Hey guys. I'm new to this sub. I recently went through a withdrawal this weekend that included the typical shakes sweats and spasms. But I also had trouble speaking and was stuttering my words. And am still having the odd stuttering and struggling to speak properly. Wondering if anyone else has had the same issue.

Yes I used to stutter all of the time when I was super hungover. It takes about 10 days for alcohol to completely clear itself from your system. Your brain is beginning to repair itself. Hang in there it gets better every day.
Yup had some stutters..its gone for the most part. Sometimes still shows up when i get excited like a little kid :) but thats a good/ funny thing..
The same thing happens to me after a major slip up but at least it always seems to go away after about 2 days to a week. Hang in there and welcome to this sub! I will not drink with you today!
