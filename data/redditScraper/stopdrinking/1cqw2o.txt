**tl;dr: was drunk now sober**..Hello wonderful drunks alcoholics problem drinkers and friends and family of the preceding.  My name is WIAVSM and I am an alcoholic.  What does that mean?  It means that if I put this drug into my system my body and my mind will want more and more until I'm falling down drunk.  No matter what intentions I have about moderating my drinking inevitably once I start I will have resumed binge drinking within a couple of days.  This has been my experience and wow I have learned that it is a common one.  One of the best and hardest things about recovery is learning just how damn common and run-of-the-mill I was.  Back when I was out in the soup partying (sometimes in a crowd often just me with my cat) I thought I was quite the big deal.  I couldn't for the life of me understand why these "normal" people weren't out to drink to oblivion at every opportunity they could but I figured it was probably due to me just being more adventurous brave and fun loving than them.  What virtues!  And it couldn't have been further from the truth.....I am 24 years old.  I grew up in a part of this country that can only be described as stuck in the 1950s.  Divorce in my community was unheard of.  People were upper middle class white protestant and quietly proud thereof.  In this sea of normalcy whatever oddities one had were best swept under the rug.  From my earliest memories though I had a feeling I was different and this was not something I could sweep away no matter how hard I tried.  And try I did.  I spent years of my life trying to figure out how to be straight surely there was something I just hadn't thought of some mental switch I could flip and like women.  After all being gay was just... undesirable and not done.  I didn't know any gay people.  My only experience growing up was hearing something vague and scandalous about Ellen being a lesbian and her show being justifiably cancelled.  Clearly gay was not good.  And I was terrified for years.  This fear fueled my isolation.  I had few close friends for the entirety of my life.  People scared me and as convinced my of my superiority as I was I couldn't control other's opinions of me so I found comfort in pushing them away....Then one night when I was 17 after years of being a good boy with good grades who always told the truth I had fallen in with a crowd of rebellious theater kids (this was about as bad as it got in my idyllic town).  I lied to my parents about where I would be and spent the night at a female friend's house drinking bacardi rum and watching some horrible Johnny Depp movie about Peter Pan.  And that's where it started that first drink made me feel amazing.  I was given a reprieve from the constant worrying and attempts to control my relationships with other people.  I could for the first time just simply be and enjoy myself and my company.  What a liberation!  But sadly it really turned out to be a trap.  (Side note: something else happened that night also confirmed for me that I was indeed quite quite quite a homosexual.)...And so I was off to the races.  For the next 7 years I got my hands on alcohol wherever and whenever I could.  In college I found myself invited to many parties and while I was always having a good time it seems in retrospect that others may not have appreciated my proclivities quite as much as I did.  How could I be so surrounded by people constantly and yet not have a friend in the world?  It didn't matter to me though because with alcohol I had escaped my insecurity....Men were interested in me and I had quite a few ill-advised relationships.  The common factor in almost all of them especially in the later ones was alcohol.  Every single person I dated and every single person whom I spent any appreciable amount of time with was likely an alcoholic.  And I suffered for it.  My first love whom I had been living with for a year got angry with me one night and cut my throat with a broken wine glass.  To date this remains the signature trauma of my life.  I thought we had the perfect love story but here was my mother scrubbing my blood off the walls.  I cannot articulate the horror.  Alcohol and alcoholism and turned my knight in shining armor into a villain and my life into a nightmare.  But I wouldn't give it up.  This my friends is what we alcoholics mean when we say we are powerless against alcohol.....I was alone again.  I got a restraining order (partly by telling the judge that my lover was an alcoholic.  The irony...) Still in college and unable to heat the house through the winter instead of saving my money I decided to just sleep under the covers with a bottle of cheap scotch to stay warm.  It's so utterly clear in retrospect that I was an alcoholic and I knew I was at the time actually.  I just didn't understand that alcoholism was something I needed to do something about.  For me declaring I was an alcoholic was just a way to say "I love to drink!"....Somehow I managed to wake up out of a 4 year blackout with an engineering degree.  Having a set work schedule made my drinking a lot easier to plan.  After college I got blackout drunk every night and I kept trying to find love in all the wrong places.  This wretched pattern of cheap booze and casual sex (both desperate attempts to feel less alone) continued until December 12 2012.  Drinking had always put me in a good mood but for the last few days beforehand I had started to get sad while drinking (alone...with my cat...)  I was laying in bed wishing I could somehow stop drinking but I couldn't figure out how.  I felt utterly completely weak.  Defeated.  Powerless.  It was a Tuesday night when I drunk off of two bottles of wine texted a friend of mine who has been in the program since the 80s.  I asked him to take me to a meeting.  And the next morning we went.  And then I went again and again and again.  ....I can say without reservation that I love Alcoholics Anonymous.  My only previous attempt at sobriety was 2 years ago when after a particularly typical night of embarrassment I decided I needed to get my drinking under control.  After 9 days of complete sobriety I figured I must have really learned how to control my drinking.  Two days later I was back into full swing.  Alcoholism does not work that way.  Sobriety can not teach you how to drink.  Never forget that!...Going to that first meeting terrified me.  I felt like I was in for a real punishment.  But as soon as I walked in I was saw smiling faces and people laughing.  What the hell is wrong with these people I thought.  Don't they know they're sober?  The horror.  But the meeting started and I looked around the room.  Here were so many people each of them with the same struggle as I.  They were every shape size age and gender.  My loneliness eased and I found courage and strength in their openness.  I wasn't afraid any more that night.....AA has made me feel so welcome and I could not be more grateful for it.  I have an amazing sponsor who has lived a life so similar to mine and I actually have friends that care about me.   AA has given me back some of the things that alcoholism took away from me.  It's up to me to ensure that I don't lose them again.  Rigorous honesty and a sincere desire to stay sober combined with a fellowship of sober drunks can give anybody sobriety one day at a time.......If you aren't sure you're an alcoholic there's only one way to be sure: go out and drink.  Don't waste people's time with backpeddling and excuses.  Go drink.  You can't get better until you're sure.  And no matter how many people tell you that you're an alcoholic it won't do you any good until you agree with them with all your might.  If you are sure you're an alcoholic there is a wonderful solution out there that has been proven to work for people who follow it. Give it a shot you probably can't afford not to......Thank you for reading.  I'll be happy to answer any questions you might have :)

Thanks for sharing it is good to get to know you a little. Except of course I already know you -as some of your story is mine.  And both of are not nearly as unique as we had strongly supposed.
Thanks WIAVSM! Glad you are here.  I identified with a lot of the feelings behind your story.  And I too grew an instant dislike for all the members of AA who were so happy and free when I became a member.  Thank goodness I became one of those people.  I loved what you said... "sobriety can not teach you how to drink".  Because I tried every way I knew how to prove to myself I wasn't an alcoholic.  I am so glad I surrendered no more fighting the disease and finding people here like you is a real blessing in my life.

Thanks for sharing WIAVSM! I don't currently have any gay people in my circle of friends [I have throughout the years but they've moved or whatever; and one died of cancer. :( ].  Do you go to a LGBT meeting or a general AA meeting?  And if it's a general meeting do they know that you're gay?  And if so how accepting are they?.
Thanks!  You have so much joy in your writing.
