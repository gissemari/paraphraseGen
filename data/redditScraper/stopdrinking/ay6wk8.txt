Honestly lost track of how many times this has happened. Im so fucking mad at myself.

Being mad at yourself will not solve anything. You may have relapsed but chalk it up to learning and improving for next time. Putting yourself down about it won't make anything better but worse. 
I hear you. It's so frustrating. I'm glad you posted. I wish you strength and peace. I've been there too.  Try again. Please. Here's an internet hug. 
I'm sorry you're going through this how will you do it differently this time?  Don't give up but I suggest you try a new approach to your sobriety.  Doing the same thing over again may only bring the same result.  Are you going to meetings or seeing a therapist for counseling?  How about rehab?  There are good solutions out there you don't have to continue to live this way.  Hang in there!
Don't beat yourself up. Sobriety can be a process.  
Dust yourself off and get back in the saddle! I had a relapse on Sunday - right back at meetings and talking to others to try and see where I went wrong and to prevent it again.don't stay I. Your head too long. Have you talked to someone in real life? I find it helps  
15+ beers was my number too..Its tough..Iwndwyt
Hop back on the sober train and take it one day at a time. I will not drink with you today. 
Welcome friend. It becomes failure if you don't get up and try again. Keep coming back. I will NOT drink with you today! Peace
I relapsed so many times.  I kept trying and eventually I got to a better place.  Wishing you the best my friend ! You can do this.
Same bro. Lets bounce back stronger!
