Hi.I'm in my late 40's and have been drinking regularly since about the age of 18 its been part of my life for longer than I can remember. ..I think I'm pretty functional never drunk drive or got into trouble through drinking and have a good marriage great but high-stress job nice home no money issues etc etc...BUT...for all this time I've been drinking beer for around 5 days a week as I've gotten older I've self moderated (can't handle the quantity anymore) so midweek I'll have 4-5 Corona size beers most nights and a bit more at a weekend usually I have a few beers before dinner and stop afterwards...The thing is I'm really noticing the effects this regular imbiment is having on me:..- I'm about 30 lbs overweight.- I don't sleep well.- I'm becoming more negative anxious and tired easily overwhelmed and struggling with the mental challenge of my job..So I'd like to quit ideally for good but I'm thinking of trying for 30 days frankly this scares the stuff out of me the longest I've gone in over 20 years is about 5 days...I'm hoping that after 30 days I'll see some benefit and want to continue but I'm concerned about the boredom and the fact that I consider a drink my "reward"...Anyway I just really wanted to put my thoughts down somewhere and hopefully get some feedback on what to expect if I do the 30 days...For now its Sunday (a very regular drinking day with the prospect of back-to-work tomorrow) and I won't drink today.

I'm only 28 days in but I think I can give you some help... But keep in mind I'm still very new to this..       I'm in my mid 30s and drank consistently since my early 20s. 28 days is actually the 2nd longest stretch I've ever had. First off don't plan for 30 days plan for just one day at a time... Don't worry about any longer than right now... today. .       Secondly you've spent years building a habit and that needs to be understood first. A book that really helped me is called: The Power of Habit. Your brain expects the "reward" of drink it's become accustomed to. I had to fill my first few days with sweets. I normally don't eat sweets but my first few days I replaced alcohol with ice cream. This helped for two reasons I was giving my brain an award substitute and your body still expects the simple sugars you had with alcohol. I since cut back and only eat ice cream a couple of times a week..       Last the advice I give is summed up in a single acronym: **H.A.L.T.** which stands for **H**ungry **A**ngry **L**only **T**ired. Your resolve to not drink is weakened by these situations so pay attention. You might do good to find a local AA meeting. I actually attend Agnostic/Free thinkers meetings as I'm atheist and I don't identify with the religious aspect of AA but if you don't have those kind of meetings where you live I suggest trying to find some meeting/ meetings you like otherwise. In spite of what anyone tells you the only requirement to attend any AA meeting is simply a desire to quit drinking..       Good luck and I hope you get to hear from some others with some more sobriety that can give you better picture of what to expect.
In response to the title of your post: I was scared once too. Scared that I wouldn't be the same me. Scared that I wouldn't enjoy life the way I used to. Or even "deal" with life like I used to. In all reality I actually wasn't dealing with life at all at that time--drinking every day in order to put off everything for yet another day... I'm a perfectionist. All or nothing kind of guy. I want to drink every day or I do not want to drink at all. The trouble is stopping the cycle long enough to not drink at all. These tendencies lead to *intense* bouts of procrastination. So I was engaging in two forms of procrastination:..1. Putting my life on hold. My problems on hold. My goals on hold. My dreams on hold...2. Putting off not stopping the cycle of addiction by drinking large amounts daily because it was easier to just drink. At that time I was content just helplessly drinking. ..Back in 2014 when I made it through my first month sober [I made my first 30  Day post ever and felt better than I had in many years.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2e5j6e/30_days/) Those 30 days sustained me for another 3 months. And that chunk of sober time taught me a lot about what I wanted to recreate and revise this time around. ..So being scared isn't a bad thing. I realized *so much* in a month. It was enough time to realize how much I was damaging my self. I am still scared but in an excited and nervous way because when I am sober I am open to the infinite possibility of each day. And for that I am thankful.
Even though you only drink 5 days out of 7 (and have some non-drinking days) and your daily intake in relatively low don't discount the notion that you may be physically dependent on alcohol and may benefit from talking to your doctor...I speak only for myself but much of my drinking was to stave off withdrawals and I have only been to discontinue my drinking by either tapering off alcohol using alcohol or by getting medical assistance (either detoxing at home with prescribed benzodiazapenes or detoxing with benzo's at a detox centre)...Consider talking to your doctor and go from there.
My initial target was 30 days. As it approached I didn't want to undo that progress so I extended another 30 then another. ..I struggled at first withdrawals in the early days including night sweats and fatigue. I fought through urges rationalizations and excuses helped by substitute drinks (stocked up on sparkling water) and distractions (gaming; walks reading etc.). ..Being free of alcohol gave me the opportunity to slowly build and discover a life without alcohol at its center. I discovered how unnecessary alcohol is: I am much better off without it. I sleep very well I have the discipline to work out regularly I've been able to engage properly with CBT therapy and work on my coping skills and anxiety. I'm happier healthier and free of that ball and chain around my ankle...I won't go back to drinking I'd end up where I left off and I left off for good reasons.
I was scared too. I'm just over 30 days and I've lost weight I'm sleeping well and my mental state is not in a fog during the day. It's worth it to stop for a day then considering doing the same the next. Good luck.
I personally didn't see any benefits after 30 days. What I saw instead was an awful mess created by alcohol. Like you I was highly functional and it didn't affect my life... until I saw all the indirect negative effects in my first 30 days...When the alcohol fog dissipates you really become conscious of your problems and the reason why you should really stop.
I feel so much better mentally and physically  and I realized what control alcohol had over my mind and my body!.Feeling proud of myself and happy for the decision I made for myself and my family.  Take it one day at a time and don't think forever... I will join you and not drink today!
I started w a 30 day challenge to myself to dry out for the month of January. I was 100% committed to the first 30 days; I would not fail. Told myself I could re-evaluate after 30 days. ..I felt better and began to understand the effects of ethanol on my body and mind and the dynamics of addiction. My detox was hard and I'm not going to go through that again.  There were days in the first 50 days that I was lethargic and mentally un-focused but at least I was not hung over. I have not lost actual weight but I'm in the gym 3 days/wk min and there's no flab around the edges anymore. I feel great. The benefits started coming and I wanted to see whet the next sober day would bring. I'll admit it took about 90 days to get to feeling solid in my sobriety. I had step-ups in clarity and sharpness at days 53 and 85. ..I'm a mid-40s male w a stressful and high paying job. I also realized that to keep up with my peers and beat back the young bros coming up I had to be crisp and being sober gave me a mental advantage that I didn't previously have...The 30 day challenge worked for me and then I transitioned to the "one day at a time" mindset. The other key for me has been that I am sober for myself. Others get to share in it but by making it for me it is harder to re-negotiate terms or "blaming" others who "make" me stop drinking. Bc of this I find my sobriety a lot more "durable" in the face of challenges. Sober on.
When I first posted on this bored less than two weeks ago I was scared as hell I was crying and felt so helpless. Now not so much. I'd grown to hate the person I was drunk and I'm excited about living a life without alcohol. Focusing on everything I have to gain and not what I'm giving up has really helped.
At least the first two days I did not drink I did have trouble falling asleep until 4 am. But I did relax and woke up around 7-8 am. Pretty fresh. Same story second night and morning. Third evening tired of little sleep and fell alseep around 1 am. Everytime I thought about going to the store for stuff I DO need beer popped to my mind. Not because I wanted it only because I was so used to buying it. Some stories here really make me respect the stoppers and give me the feeling I have some 'mild form' of alcoholism since stopping for me is a  bit easier than expected. But I still need to do this. One day at the time.
