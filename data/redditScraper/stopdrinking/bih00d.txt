Thinking of drinking. I've come far and made a lot of improvements. I've been down this road before where I thought I didn't have a problem and drank after some time sober and it didn't end well but here I am again. This time the biggest change I've made is to my career and I quit serving and bartending which I hated and work better hours and I have found my mental health has greatly improved. Is it possible I was drinking for emotional reasons in the past and could be OK now? It was a struggle to quit in the past but I was also very depressed.

Congratulations!   You might be on to something.   I am discovering that I am appreciating Life in general more.
Well done!  
Or maybe you were depressed because you were drinking       or maybe it's a bit of both a sad vicious cycle. Congratulations on your 202 days IWNDWYT!  
Is it worth the risk to find out?
