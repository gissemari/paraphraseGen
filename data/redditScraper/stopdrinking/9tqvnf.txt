I'm an alcoholic. I know that. Known since I was 17 and I did not know how to explain it before then but I heard a definition and I knew. Not good at booze. Check. I struggled through my early adulthood/teenage years. Had bouts of sobriety maybe 3 weeks maybe 9 months. I was inconsistent at best in my personal care.(irrelevant) married young kept drinking- went to rehab- came out. Stayed sober a little started again. Marriage ended. .Had a party phase- didn't care- lived life. Multiple jobs. Would quit when I got too drunk and couldn't show. Etc. patterns. I hated it but didn't love myself enough to make a change..Huge thing happened. I started (yet another restaurant job! I was a shift leader) and I met the man who not only introduced me to God saved my life but also is now my husband. .It is a longer story than what people would care about: but I ended up sobering up finding an actual career and having two kids. .My first born was born incredibly ill (nothing alcohol related I had been sober nearly a year before we conceived her). She spent her first year of life in the hospital and I stayed sober! We found out about our second when she was 6 months old (unexpected) and while we were not planning on having them so close together welcomed it. My second was born  July 2017 and we closed on our first home August 2017. .Great story right? An alcoholic made real life strides! .Except: something happened. I had post partum depression. I didn't know how to categorize it initially- I just knew I felt anxious tired and overwhelmed all the time. I didn't want to hold my son. I didn't want to breastfeed him I was just so so tired. I wrote a lot of it off as the stress of a new mother or two a new house and having a timeline to return to work. ..Long story short:: which there will be a TLDR:: I gave in one day and got a drink from the grocery store while picking up milk. I figured it was an isolated event who was I hurting?..It's been over a year now. It's escalated so badly that it is affecting my work and marriage. I'm ready to put it back down. Enough is enough. I am lucky I have not lost everything again. I am embarrassed and ashamed. But my kids deserve their whole mama not her in pieces. I just have a lot of shame due To feeling like I should knowing better. I had nearly 3 years! I just wanna get back on the wagon!..TLDR: fell off wagon after 3 years and two kids guilt and shame can keep you off! Appointment on Tuesday with counselor but this shit doesn't die with time!
