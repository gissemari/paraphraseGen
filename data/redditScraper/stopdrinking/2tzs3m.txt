I was talking to someone who had 18 years sober and how and why they fell off the wagon. I didn't give advice or anything just listened and responded to their story. It was unbelievable how spiritually and mentally grounded this person was despite a two year (and counting) relapse. They had an awareness that this relapse was a learning experience in their overall recovery but didn't feel they had the social support necessary to start anew...We talked for hours. After an emotional talk for both of us they said "Wow. I didn't know I was this lonely. I am truly lonely."..It really hit home. I gave them my number and the URL to this group. Hopefully they feel a little less alone.

Thats crazy...18 years.  Him or Her provide any insight as to why they fell off? Sure its not a quick answer just curious.
You responded so well djamberj - she will feel less alone which is a good start. :)
I ask for a sober day every day.
Hey- love hearing that you are doing so well--- and so much wisdom! Sending this woman some love from here. Every little bit helps.
Why were you in a bar?..&gt; It was unbelievable how spiritually and mentally grounded this person was despite a two year (and counting) relapse...No she's not.
