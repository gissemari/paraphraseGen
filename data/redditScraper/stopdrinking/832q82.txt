So last week SD prompt me 27F to get a primary care doctor as well as everything that comes with it including a full work up of labs and well...the results are in! Long story short (South park)I've been a heavy drinker for the past 10 years started drinking at age 16 and alcohol has been a priority since then. I've spent so much money and so many days wasted to a hangover. Today marks 19 days free from anxiety sadness and depression. I feel really happy and healthy although some days can be a struggle but I'm glad to have you all in my pocket. I read all your stories and I'm here for you as well! Thank you all! .Soooo....I had numerous labs which all include my hemoglobin A1c TSH and lipid which I'm pleased to say came back all within normal range!.. The nail bitting lab for me was the comprehensive metabolic panel which assessed my electrolytes liver function and kidney function (which is a big one!) And well I'm very pleased to say they were also within normal range!  This is just the beginning for me and I'm darn lucky the last past years of constant self harm didn't bring me down entirely. It's a good day to be alive. Iwndwy! Cheers with Bubbly or la croix or whatever sparkling water you have in your fridge!   Thanks for reading!
