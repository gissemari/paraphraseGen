I made into day three after relapsing for a couple weeks. I feel not great today insecure about relationship and have a couple challenging events today - soccer game with partner and his ex (their son's team) and dinner afterwards - uggh. The last time it went relatively well but I feel like I need to be a tower of strength and positivity to get through. I really need to gather some chi. Please help!

Chi is gathering for you here!  Take deep breaths.  Keep yourself hydrated and have snacks.  I suggest nachos coco-cola hot chocolates and hershey's kisses.
Sending good vibes your way! Check back in if things get tough throughout the day. I'll not drink with you today.
You've got this. It's just one day. With you I will not drink today.
hey please just know time takes time with each new event you do sober you'll never have to do again for the first time. nothing worth while is ever easy but it is worth it and tonight when you look yourself in the mirror you'll be able to say to yourself you walked through it and didn't cop out on yourself. let us know how it went please because you'll also be given us hope!
Incoming chi! Hope it helps! I will not drink with you today!
Sending Kudos Chi positivity Good Vibes and hugs your way! Day 6 here I will not drink with you today no matter what good or bad happens
Think how great you felt when you woke up this morning - and how great you'll feel when you wake up tomorrow with a 4 badge. The early days are tough yes but so worth it. You CAN do this stay strong and check in here - sending chi your way - zooooom. 
Stay strong! You CAN do this!
