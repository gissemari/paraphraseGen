Haven't posted in a long time atlot has changed but I'm still kicking.  I just left my brother apartment after getting my mothers weekly frantic phone call to please go check on him to make sure he's alive.  He's alive drunk as all hell on another binge after another great week of sobriety which has become the norm for him.  Really I guess I'm posting for advice.  I've given up hope for him which I understand is horrible.  I can't understand it when I quit I quit.  That's probably why I'm struggling so much with it because I had success.  It's like he doesn't want to.  He's done/doing AA he's trade other things.  He needs a real rehab but can't afford it or really just wont do it I'm not sure.  .. ..What is there out there as far as full rehab programs that aren't going to cost an arm and a leg?.. ..I'm going to check out the side tabs now but figured I'd make a quick post.  When as getting started venting here was beyond helpful.

My sponsor actually had to go to alanon meetings to deal with her sisters addiction. Just because we've been there doesn't mean we know how to handle it on the other side of the fence.

Perhaps he really doesn't want to like you were kind of thinking. You personally have to want to quit. ..I wish you the best and I'm sorry about the trouble with your brother...Congratulations on two years
