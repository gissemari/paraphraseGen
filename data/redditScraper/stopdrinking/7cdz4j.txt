(This is a bit of a read. Felt good to jot down.)..I relapsed hard. Another bender. Another town I had never been in. Another group of people I had never met. Drug dealers. They made their money tattooing teenagers. Socially I was scraping the bottom of the barrel just to get the taste. It was completely and utterly pathetic...I have been without a phone (lost my new iPhone in the woods during a previous bender) for a few weeks. So nobody knew where I was. My poor SO hadn't heard from me in 3 days. ..Tonight he came over and my heart was racing. I knew we were going to have a talk. THAT talk. His tone was calm. "What happened? Can you give me a time frame? How did you meet these people?" He just wanted to understand. We had an open and honest discussion. I sobbed like a baby. ..There's something cathartic about strong honest communication. My SO bless him is the master when it comes to good communication. When I ran out of tears and apologies he wanted to make a game plan. "Let's do better this time" he said. "Let's make a plan." ..We made a plan for moving forward. Finally we settled down for some long overdue snuggles and I felt like I could breathe again. Despite his exhaustion he still wanted to go out. A movie? Bowling?  He named some restaurants... all without bars...No I admitted. I wanted *one last* beer. Could we go to our favorite pub? It was shameless. This alcoholic is totally shameless..."No."..And then he stroked my knee gently. Admittedly I sulked for a second and he watched me. There was no judgement in his eyes. He's just a man helping his partner with a plan. One last beer isn't part of the plan...Twenty minutes later and we're sitting at IHOP. I order a coffee. We're laughing and joking and for the first time in weeks I'm not lamenting my existence or wanting to die. We get a kids menu and crayons and play dirty MadLibs. At one point I'm laughing so hard I can't breathe. I'm showered and put together and wearing makeup. I feel like myself. We admire our matching flannel. ..This is the person I want to be. This is the person I FEEL right being. Yes every few minutes I find myself thinking about the liquor store in the shopping mall or the bar down the street. But tonight we're not going there...Tonight we're eating pancakes.
