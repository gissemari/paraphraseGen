I'm tempted to drink. I'm in pain anxious stressed and dealing with multiple other symptoms that I keep going to the doc for and my doc takes forever to follow up so this process has been ongoing for five months. I'm trying to hold myself accountable here as I'm really struggling today and don't want to give in but feeling pretty weak and lonely

I'm sorry you're struggling. You are among friends!
Hey friend! I went through something similar in my early days. I just had to keep telling myself that whatever was going on with my body drinking would only make it worse...And whenever I was feeling lonely and isolated I did just what you did by getting on here and asking for help!..You're doing just fine. Stick with it. Keep positive and keep posting! 
Oh my dear I'm so sorry you're in such pain. When I first started quitting back in January part of my plan and motivation was to get my health back on track. I made an appointment with a new GP and figured a check up just to confirm my overall decent health would be in the cards. Nope. As it stands now I'm recovering from my second major abdominal surgery of the year. Feeling much better though... my last post op appointment was positive and my next one (in a couple weeks) should clear me medically. Then I meet with my GP again (on Halloween day) to check my liver enzymes which *should* be back to normal. I'm cautiously optimistic that that will be my concluding appointment to these medical issues. ..2018 has been a helluva year littered with MANY day ones false starts and lots and lots of frustration with these medial maladies. My heart goes out to you stay strong my door's always open if you need support or to vent or anything. ..Also HUGE kudos on 39 days. I finally managed to beat my previous high score of 17 days. This is the longest I've been sober all year. You inspire me &lt;3
