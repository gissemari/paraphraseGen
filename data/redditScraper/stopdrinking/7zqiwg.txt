My counselor has suggested I read some books (or good online info) on boundaries something I struggle with and a definite factor in my drinking. Does anyone have any you have found helpful? ..I am struggling with this issue both in my personal life and at work. I've done a search but there's a lot out there.

I would suggest looking up Jordan Peterson videos on youtube (if you haven't heard of him yet). ..Posting a video so you can assess whether his lectures could be helpful for you or not: https://youtu.be/XVMvQhxN_M8?t=1m49s
I am also interested in this topic! I don't have any boundaries books to recommend myself (yet) but someone here recommended The Journey from Abandonment to Healing and it was very good and helped me.
Codependent No More by Melodie Beattie is a must!
I'm currently reading Getting Love Right: Learning the Choices of Healthy Intimacy by Terence T. Gorski (also the author of Staying Sober: A Guide for Relapse Prevention) and I'm finding it rather fantastic. There is some really good information on what healthy boundaries and choices look like.
