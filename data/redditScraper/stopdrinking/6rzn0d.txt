**This is a long post but if you don't care to read my story I do have direct questions for you guys at the end that I would really really love some help feedback on.**.. ...**My short (ish) story:** I grew up in a very bad area with crime drugs etc. (I didn't participate in any of it).  My dad and most of his friends were alcoholics (often raging). He was a wake up and drink drink until you pass out and drive while drunk and an already suspended license kind of guy...My mom didn't start drinking until she was in her late 40s (when I was 21ish). I never her saw her drink once growing up as adult. She then started drinking because her home life went to absolute hell (well it already was) when I went to college... ...**How drinking started for me:** The first time I ever drank alcohol was when my mom gave me a shot my dad's whiskey after this horrible break up with my long term high school gf. She did it because I hadn't eaten in 3 or 4 days was looking sick and wouldn't leave my room. Instantly after the shot I was finally able to eat. I then used alcohol every day for about a week or so and once I felt better I only did it with friends here and there (maybe once a week or every other week). Once school started up I stopped drinking altogether...College: I'll make this short. T/F/S nights freshman year were all parties and I drank less and less Sophomore/junior year (I got into fitness and you can't drink and lift very successfully)... ...**Pre-abuse context:** To keep it short I was moving across country to a somewhat uncool place for a good internship for my resume. My mom was supposed to come with me (not because I need her but because she needed me) as she had lived with me the previous summer during college summer break...I fly to Seattle for a wedding for a week while she stays in my apartment. I fly back and she is completely incapacitated and has drank all of my and my roommates alcohol in our entire apartment (at this point we both collected rare and other craft beers to try as one of our hobbies but drinking was one day a week for the most part). I called an ambulance and had her taken in. Of course nothing was wrong with her she was just drunk as hell. But it seemed as though she was barely breathing to me and was non-responsive when I tried to wake her...Needless to say the next day we were supposed to move together across the country where she could be free and away from all the bs she had going on in her life I had to have my grandmother come get her (I lived 3 hours from home) and I left that afternoon to head on a 2000 mile road trip... ...**When it got bad:** I got the town of my internship really didn't like it and my internship was extremely difficult and miserable for me. Now all of a sudden I am alone have no friends near me and all of the people I work with are so much older so I can't really hang out with them. Not to mention I have absolutely no money my car's transmission on the way up started jerking (which lasted all summer) and I have a large amount of credit card debt due to a grant program they fell through and I am trying to make $300 a month payments (there's math there won't go into it). Needless to say I am absolutely miserable each and every day and I can't wait for it to be over with...What do I do? I start making my credit card payment (they were maxed) and then using the new available credit to buy a six pack of beer and bad food. I would say 3-4 nights a week I was drinking at least 3 or 4 beers...all good craft beers of course and then finally I started maximizing my dollars by buying the highest ABV beers I could find. I would sit in my room watch beer reviewers online so at least I could feel like someone was there with me and interested in the same thing. Really pathetic. I had all of an air mattress TV and one folding chair in my apartment for a fold out desk. That was it for 3 months... ...**Even worse:** I would drink these 3 or 4 beers a night get hammered and order a pizza down the road. If I didn't have money for delivery of if there was a pick up special I'd get in my car and go drive the 1.5 miles down the road from my apartment to get it. Yes AFTER drinking. I have no idea what my BAC was but how I never got pulled over is a miracle to me to this day... ...**It continues:** Eventually of course the internship ends and I go back to college for my senior year. Much damage had been done. My girlfriend said she didn't even recognize me at the airport because I got so big in just 3 months. If I had to estimate (although I never weighed) I would say that I probably gained upwards of 30 lbs in three months. According to Pizza Hut's nutrition calculator a large pepperoni is ~2400 calories a pie I ate this along with 3-4 200-300 calorie beers and a small bag of chips at work....easily bringing in close to 3500+ calories a day. I did absolutely no exercise and none of the clothes I brought with me fit when I got home...I struggled (and was made fun of) with my weight from my entire childhood. Finally had the willpower beginning in high school to shed a lot and then further breaking through freshman year of college where I got addicted and looked great. To see this happen well..... ...**Still Worse:** My senior year of college was a nightmare. I continued my drinking habits drinking alone almost every day and eating horribly. It snowballed I was reclusive lost all of my friends because I was too ashamed for them to see me and never saw my mother again....she died last year from her alcoholism (remember she started drinking in her late 40s!). This continued after I graduated and well into the first two years of my career... ....**It got better:** Finally it got to the point where if I drank more than one drink (which is still true today) I feel terrible the next day. Not quite hangover but super groggy super "dry" just shitty. So I decided my life was either going to be like this forever or I am going to make it better one day at a time. I weighed myself 255lbs as a 5' 8" male. My actual waist was 50inches around (where my pants fit was 44inches). ..At this point I quit drinking cold turkey. Woke up one day and just said I'm done. To my surprise and relief...I never felt any withdrawal symptoms whatsoever. No headaches no shakes no seizures nothing. I lost 40lbs in 3 months-ish. Felt amazing. Stayed at that level for a good 6 months and then my mom died. I didn't gain weight or go back to drinking but it did derail me for a couple of months. However I got my back with my life and lost another 20lbs by the end of last year down to 195... ...**It gets worse again:** My dad died at the end of last year (November). Today I weigh 215 again. Over the past two years I definitely still drank alcohol. Usually a couple of times a week but lately it has been more and more again often 3-4 days a week. I want to finish the weight loss that I started but anxiety is killing me. I've always had anxiety which is why my drinking got so out of hand but since I lost both parents seemingly unrelated things are getting worse and worse in terms of anxiety...I have tried things like Xanax but nothing cures my anxiety like alcohol. Nothing comes close at all... ...**Today:** Because of alcohol being the "cure" to the worst part of my life now (anxiety) every time I try to go to the gym and get in shape again within 2-3 days something always comes up it seems and I'm uneasy on edge feel hopeless. Everytime I just have a couple of beers and I'm set all of that goes away. Alcohol has become my coping mechanism and I have lost the ability to deal with things on my own...I'm drinking some weeks 2-3 days usually only two beers (I have a low tolerance still somehow) and some weeks I am drinking 4-5 days... ...**Questions I have:**.. ...1) When I stopped drinking after 3 solid years of doing it nearly every day (with periods of every day drinking) how is it possible I felt no withdrawals? Is that not a long enough time period?..2) I haven't drank in two days but I am freaking out now if I am alcohol addiction signals. For instance I have dreams where people give me alcohol I wake up and am so relieved that I didn't actually drink in real life. Is this odd? ..Also how do you describe a craving for alcohol? I notice that I think about alcohol a lot wish I could open up a can but this is more or less easy for me to control and say "nah". But is this a "craving"? Or is alcohol craving more like the way you crave water when you are really dehydrated? ..I only ask because I feel like the alcohol drinking dreams are somewhat the same way I dream if I am dehydrated or have to go to the bathroom. I just dream that I am already doing it over and over (drinking water drinking alcohol etc.)..3) I feel like I am in control over my drinking that I can stop at anytime. But because I don't have many hobbies I enjoy the taste (note i won't drink liquor bud light etc...craft beer only or I don't drink it) and my girlfriend and I do it as an activity together that I am not addicted just its one of the things I like to do for fun...4) Even if I have a low tolerance for alcohol (~2 beers of 5% make me feel solid 3-4 make me feel completely wasted) could I still be addicted?.
