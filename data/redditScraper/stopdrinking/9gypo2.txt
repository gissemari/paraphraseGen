I'm not exactly happy about it (although in a way I'm sure I should be) mostly because it wasn't exactly voluntary. ..This is the first time in a very *very* long time that I've made it to day 3 with no intention of drinking tonight. And I'm not exactly proud to say it's mostly because I've been super ill since the last time I went out. (My friends suspect something happened to my drink that night as my behavior was... odd... But I suppose that's yet another hazard of not being aware of your surroundings...)..I know I should stay sober. Sober Me is a better me and always will be. Getting sloppy and making an ass of yourself is not as cute as you think you look... Not to mention I recently lost my best friend to his struggle. He just couldn't stop. He made it 67 days then saw his ex wife... His body just couldn't handle it... ..So besides any other effects I know very personlly the physical effects of this condition. I cannot go out like that. ..I'm not feeling very strong today but I will not drink with you.

I feel you on the not looking cute thing. Yesterday I re-met a coworker of my boyfriends. I remembered meeting him but I didn't remember just apparently me and my drunk friend immediately started threatening to curse him within 5 minutes of meeting him. We thought it was really funny but apparently he was actually kinda freaked out. He was looking at my with this like  wary look and man ... drunk me makes a really dumb reputation. .Im not feeling very strong either  it's day 1 (but not the first time) for me and IWNDWYT.
