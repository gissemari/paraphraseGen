Good Morning/ Afternoon    .theme: Humility    .**"The proud man can learn humility but he will be proud of it."- Mignon McLaughlin**    .What I get from it: this quote tells on me. I'm not a humble person by nature I have to make an effort to be a part of and not apart from. I am so much better but I still struggle with just biting my tongue or recognizing although I am accurate (book wise) no one cares to be corrected and that it is counterproductive to the group to point out an inaccuracy.

Hah!  I resemble that remark!
I struggle with this very much.  I hate asking for help and it eventually sinks me every time.  How does one embrace humility? How do I get over myself and just reach out when I am struggling?  I am scared of seeming weak but in reality there are moments when I am weak and need help from others.
