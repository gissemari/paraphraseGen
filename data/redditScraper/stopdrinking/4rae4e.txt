I understand how this disorder works but still sad...He had about 3 years. .I wondered why he wasn't returning my phonies. ..He is in rehab now. I am going to rehab next week. I believe in him. He believed in me...I will keep in touch. He is a good guy. maybe me and him can message each other in rehab...
