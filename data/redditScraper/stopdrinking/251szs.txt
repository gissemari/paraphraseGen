10 days out of rehab my father was on the couch all day and I looked in the drug cabinet and somehow he got a Norco prescription which he abused because it was filled 2 days earlier and was basically empty. I suspect he's been drinking as well which was always his "main" problem. My family and I don't know what to do he had to hit rock bottom to go to rehab (losing his job renal failure) but now he's right where he left off.  His relapse was about a week ago at this point and I don't what what he's up to since he's isolating himself from his family.  I want to support him but he's lied so much to me and his doctors about these issues.  Any advice or stories about counseling and or AA/NA? I myself have decided to quit alcohol since me and me dad are so alike with our addictive personalities.  Do I convince him to go to rehab again because I don't think that will help his psychological dependence?

Man all you can do is take care of yourself. Nothing will help your dad until he decides to help himself...I'd suggest you going to Al anon to make yourself healthier. Then and if he decides to get sober you will be healthy and have the proper tools to assist him. Take care if yourself first.
I am so sorry for your situation!  Please know that this is your dad's issue and not yours.  Although that is probably not a lot of comfort to you at this point.  ..One thought might be to attend some Alanon meetings.  I am sure you will get amazing perspective from those.  In addition if you feel the need to quit as well don't hesitate to go to your own AA meetings.  Maybe just maybe by setting your own example through these things your father may start to follow your lead.  But regardless you are not responsible for his disease!..Good luck my friend.
I've dealt with this with my mom since I could remember. I've been struggling with it more so lately now that everyone has given up on her but I can't let go and watch her die. If you find anything on this please share it would he so helpful. I wish you the best of luck with your situation and thanks for sharing.
