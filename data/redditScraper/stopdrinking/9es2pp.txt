I get so much out of coming here. Even 133 days in things can still be difficult. But reading the stories of those in their first days/weeks reminds me of how much I don't want to be back there again. Reading about those further along in their journeys reminds me how much growth I still have to go and how much change I still have to look forward to. When I post people are positive and supportive. What a wonderful place. ..Thank you all for being here and sharing your authentic selves with us: this sharing and vulnerability in our struggles and growth is beautiful and valuable. You are seen and appreciated no matter where you are on your sobriety journey. &lt;3

Yeah this sub is amazing. Iwndwyt! 
It's the only sub I truly feel like visiting every day.  I can't imagine what it would be like without it.
Nice work on 133!
Amen! The camaraderie in this group is amazing. I feel so proud and optimistic for everyone who is just beginning. In addition it's reassuring when I read about other people's experiences. But most of all a big shout out to those of you who take time everyday to lift up those who are struggling but trying desperately and just need an ear. You guys are my heroes!
We're glad you're here with us!  
Still coming here too almost every day :)
