I said I was struggling in the morning check-in and didn't think much of it.  So many people encouraged me and cheered me on during a day I struggled I finally opened the waterworks this evening which I never do.  Thank you to all of you here at SD thank you for encouraging me to finally stop drinking.  The day I found this sub I got my life back.

This warms my heart.  Thanks for being part of this unique place.

Thank YOU for being here encouraging us and sharing these heartfelt words.
Thanks you for sharing in this journey with all of us!  I'm glad you were able to have some emotional release this evening.  I've found in sobriety I am more able to recognize the need to cry.  Before I was always fighting it my bottle as my weapon of choice.  ..Screw that.  Here's to healing body and mind!
Great Post!  Thanks for sharing!
Thank you for sharing! Reading/posting on SD everyday makes a world of difference
what is this check in you mention ? do we comment on the checkin post or is there a button you guys press to check in ? ..
I too feel glad I found this sub 
Strange chemical changes happen for sure. I was sat on the toilet and burst out crying for no reason once. My kitten was playing in the shower cubicle opposite and it just triggered a rush of emotion. ..I'm a 6'5 37 year old man....lol.
