And I'm really struggling. I went out last night and got plastered. My boyfriend picked me up from the bar and was so angry at me. I started hitting him and he started hitting me. I'm so toxic. I can't believe it has escalated to this point. I could not be more disappointed in myself.

I'm sorry. Glad you are back. Every day is a new chance. I hope you embrace this one and yourself while you are at it. IWNDWYT 
The day after is so hard. You're not alone. 
Glad you are back!
Thank you all for your continued support. I have a long way to go but I will get there. Day 2 again. Don't drink with me today.
