I took it around 6PM last night and took my second dose just an hour ago. Last night it made me VERY dizzy after I first took it. My head felt like it weighed 100 lbs. I was hot (especially my face and head) and I was a little achy all over. I took two Advil and felt much better an hour later. And then I stayed up most of the night...I just couldn't turn-off what little bit of "wired" I felt from the medication. I did fall asleep eventually...I haven't had any terrible cravings today--at least not the ones I've had to painstakingly fight every moment during a specific window of the day as I do usually (without medication). It felt very good. I've had several opportunities to drink (my future mother-in-law just sent me a bottle of my favorite liquor...she isn't aware I struggle like this) but didn't give in! I have taken Naltrexone before and in my experience once I had that first drink while taking it I felt compelled to keep drinking (I think the psychological pleasure I derive from drinking kicked-in). It can only do so much for you...I definitely see where others emphasize this isn't a "fix-all"; you most definitely need something else in addition to this. You must proactively work toward keeping your goal.

Make sure to always take it on a full stomach (I took it first thing in the morning once and spent the whole day sick and threw up) and I would start w/ half a pill for a few days if you're not doing that already. I've been taking it for 3 weeks and it's helped me a lot- I still have something inside me trying to convince me to drink but the thought doesn't make me as excited anymore/I don't have the crawling out of my skin type of cravings I used to have. So it's been helpful but yes definitely not a fix all
