9:30 am and I'm already feeling like I want a drink after work. This weekend was somewhat great for me. I went to a concert Friday night to see my favorite band and got pretty bad but then I didn't drink the rest of the weekend. Today is my Day 3 and I would love to make it through... I can't remember the last time I went 3 days without a drink must have been at least a year or more. Heck 2 days without a drink is an accomplishment for me. 3 days is unheard of. Sad I know...Already this morning the stress is high. Friends are stressing me out work is stressing me out. I have a major case of anxiety. All I can think about is going home binge watching "Intervention" (ha!) and having a drink after work -- my typical Monday. I need some motivation... If it wasn't so dang cold I would hit up the lake instead but yeah.... cold. The struggle is real this morning. Thanks for listening.
