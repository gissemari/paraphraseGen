Woke up today expecting to feel horrible to have to pound down water after water and just generally be in bad shape. But that wasn't what happened. Yesterday was another day one and I thought i wouldn't make it through it. But I did and I'm feeling so relieved. I already got so many planned relapses in my head but I'll try really hard not to give in just to experience this feeling of relief again. Made it to day 2 fuck yeah!

Congratulations!  For me in the early days it was just making it through the day white-knuckling it....then I'd wake up to that glorious sober feeling.  Eventually I got stronger and it got easier.  I wish you the best! IWNDWYT 
Fuck yeah!! Enjoy your day iwndwyt
