Good Morning/Afternoon!..*Theme:* Inspirational..**"You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something   your gut destiny life karma whatever. This approach has never let me down and it has made all the difference in my life." - [STEVE JOBS](http://www.positivelypositive.com/quotes/you-can%E2%80%99t-connect-the-dots-looking-forward-you-can-only-connect-them-looking-backwards-so-you-have-to-trust-that-the-dots-will-somehow-connect-in-your-future-you-have-to-trust-in-something/)**..*What I get from it:*  I have a really hard time [trusting and believing](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/0d/16/7e/0d167e3d7979ad439334889c74c054b2.jpg) that things will work out for the best and be OK. This is a daily struggle for me.  However I have learned that [worrying and fretting](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/02/4b/46/024b4608b5720ea1d2599c23be283dd8.jpg) and constantly thinking the worst about everyone and everything [serves me absolutely no purpose](http://inspirationalquotes.club/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/InspirationalQuotes.Club-mind-best-friend-worst-enemy-thinking-intelligent-unknown.jpg) and does no one any good.  Even if things are going to turn out shitty I am not required to spend all of my energy obsessing over it prior to it actually happening.  So [as hard as it is to trust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RWEseP-ouk) that all will be well I work on it every day.  ..Have an awesome day all!

I have massive trust issues too. I wish I could remove that part of my brain.... Its something I have to work on CONTINUOUSLY. 
Good one!  Thanks!
Great job on this post KJ.  I am truly inspired by this today.
I think the only way I can have that trust is if I am living each day as much as I can in the manner I envision my future to look like i.e. I want to be someone with financial security and a spiritual life so today I can meditate and be frugal. 
I love to think that everything that I have gone through has led me to this very moment and that I am exactly where I need to be - right now. Worrying about the future doesn't change it. I do still find myself thinking about the future but I really try not to worry about it today. Wherever I end up I will be exactly where I need to be. Happy Saturday!
