Despite what my badge says I relapsed over the weekend. 70 days is pretty darn good for me. It's probably the second longest stretch of sobriety 15 years. ..Therein lies the problem I'm not a daily drinker and sometimes not even a weekly drinker. I can get 10 day stints of sobriety fairly easily but then it always ends in a blowout. ..I tell myself that it's not a problem because I can go these extended periods without drinking but I know thats not true. ..At this point I've lost a lot of hope - obviously not all hope or I would not be here typing this...Anyone find themselves in a similar situation? How did you handle it?.

my experience is binge drinking is as dangerous if not more so than stereotypical daily "alcoholic drinking" (not that either is good). ..the chances of alcohol poisoning  blackouts arrest injury is higher by the nature of the blowout - while the 'daily drinker' is perhaps more likely to set the couch on fire from an unattended cigarette but when the daily allotment is up he or she passes out.....ITS THE SAME PROBLEM slightly different manifestations but the same treatment - abstinence.
