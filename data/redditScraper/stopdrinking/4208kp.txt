Made it through the season ups and downs as expected few rant posts I'm sure (I don't like to look through my history best way is to always look forward not back)... only to be confronted on the first week back with appendicitis & peritonitis. What Joy!..Luckily they managed to schedule the op the same day so I spent 2 days in hospital and 3 weeks working from home with pain control moderated by my wife should I suddenly get an insatiable lust for it (I didn't morphine is a rancid thing cures the pain but I don't like it never have. Brings on my anxiety attacks). Thanks NHS though despite your rep and your constant struggle I was in and out within 48 hours...In just a few days and I'll hit my first year. Then I'll stop counting quite so much and try and help out on here a little more. ..Something a year ago I swore I would never be able to do is nearly done. And long may it continue. ..I've watched my friends and family drink themselves silly over the holidays and it's something I want no part of. ..No More.

Only a few rant posts? That's impressive given the number of rants my first year required :) Glad you're through the surgery and recovery and closing in on that year!
YAY for almost a year! I will be here to celebrate that big milestone with you and all the other sobernauts here! :)
shiny is my favourite colour!
