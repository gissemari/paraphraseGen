I slept like shit; awful dreams and restlessness. Tomorrow is my 29th birthday and I don't want this struggle anymore. .I will not drink with you today.

It's tough. Hang in there.  .I've said the same before my 39th and 49th birthdays. Here's hoping I don't for my 59th and you don't either.
With you
