And it was great! ..I've been trying to stop drinking for a while now and had some good stretches of sobriety over the last couple of years however I keep relapsing and really can't control drinking once I start...I really want to stop drinking more than anything. I've seen glimpses of the person I could be...So I went to a support meeting last night not AA. Just a local alcohol support group. I was really nervous beforehand and didn't know what to expect but everyone was so friendly and understanding didn't have to talk if I didn't want to but I did and it feels like a huge step in the right direction and a big weight lifted from my shoulders. I got telephone numbers from everyone there to text or call if I need to. ..Really glad I took the decision to go...I won't drink today.
