Storytime...I live about 300 miles from my family having moved all over the country with deliberate limited contact with my sister. We were close growing up but about college things turned sour. I loved her but I didn't like her. Our texts generally revolved around superficial topics. I desperately wanted to be the Big Sister^(TM) to her all my life but getting close to her was like trying to hug a cactus. I distanced myself from her indefinitely when I moved away from family in 2010...Then on March 28 2017 a received a text from a number I didn't recognize...*"Hey CreativeAsFuuu this is Kristy Alice's \[sister\] friend. Alice really needs help \[...\] We planned an intervention a year ago but Mark \[fiance\] backed out when he found out he'd have to stop drinking too. We need to try again and we don't know what to do."*..Having been gone so long I didn't know what to believe. I responded and said I'd help but I was cautious. I knew Alice drank heavily but she was a bartender. Many bartenders I knew drank heavily. Plus we were raised in a culture where drinking is just a way of life...I called my mom and told her about Kristy's text. She told me story after story of situations my sister got into. I'm not going to air her dirty laundry here even though I'm using pseudonyms but just imagine the worst things that you could do or that could happen while drunk and Alice experienced them. ..I needed to balance this drama with my dad's ever-pragmatic input (our parents are divorced)...My stomach sank. It was all true. I called my mom back and told her I'd help. She and my dad were arguing (as usual) about the right way to go about this so I mediated as much as possible. Everyone wanted to help but we disagreed about how. I drove home on March 31 and we recruited the help of a rehab program volunteer. ..On April 1 (the irony is not lost on me) Alice showed up to the hospital for detox completely wasted and reeking of Jameson. Her blood alcohol was over 0.4%. That is not a typo: Zero-point-four-something-percent...She agreed to detox and rehab. It was the second time in my life I saw my father cry. Not that I'm-A-Man-And-I'm-Not-Crying-You're-Crying kind of cry but a full-on bear-hug-and-bawl...We pooled our money for a medically supervised detox and rehab. Her detox was textbook rough. I have never been so afraid in my life; I can't begin to imagine what my sister felt. Family and worked in shifts staying in the hospital with her 24 hours a day. It took a week to run its course and on April 20 she entered a non-profit 90-day all-female in-patient rehab program. I was weary of the religious aspect (and she was too) but honestly it wasn't Jesus-down-your-throat religion but find-something-to-believe-in-even-if-it's-not-our-Jesus kind of religious programming. They visited every church or synagogue or temple within 50 miles just to expose the women to all the flavors of community support. As warm and welcoming as it sounds they were not fucking around. It was a get-serious-or-get-out approach. ..It worked. She celebrated two years of sobriety last week and I cannot put into words how much I admire her strength her resolve and how much I value having a real relationship with my baby sister. She is brilliant. Smart witty funny loyal honest diligent. I knew this person existed under all the mess but now she vibrates with energy. She is radiant. I can only credit the rehab program with starting the journey it was my sister who continued it...Today we talk about makeup our cats our spouses jobs life advice our mom's dramatic antics the cute wild animals our spouses say we can't have but that we will just come home with one day and whoops too late now we have to keep it. We are real sisters now. As sisters should be. She is an inspiration. I am so so proud of her. I have a real genuine relationship with a *person*. I have tried to tell her how proud I am of her but she is still embarrassed by the whole thing and doesn't want "I was a drunk" to define her life. I understand that. So I don't talk about any of it--the drinking the detox the rehab--unless she brings it up first. And even then I try not to say too much but she has no idea that it is **nothing** to be embarrassed about. ..But y'all. I am **SO. FUCKING. PROUD.** I could cry. She doesn't want to hear it yet but the world needs to know how amazing my sister is. She got a job though a staffing program after rehab that she hung onto for a year to build her "real-job" resume. She now has a job at a hospital and received two promotions in the almost-year she's been there. She is simply thriving. She is fun. I love her and I like her. A lot...That's not to say she hasn't been tempted to drink; she has. Birthday parties football games festivals. A spouse that still drinks. But she held strong to her commitment. She even went to Mardi Gras in New Orleans and didn't drink a drop (I don't know if you know how hard that is but it is the ultimate test in my opinion). She turned her life around. She is successful. Beautiful. She inspired others to follow suit just by being herself. She doesn't preach the no-drink lifestyle she just lives it and lives it gracefully. ..And she is not drinking today. I am not drinking today...If you are struggling know that there is someone out there who believes in you. Who supports you. You can do this. One day at a time you can do this. This sub believes in you. I believe in you. ..Hugs internet strangers. Hugs.
