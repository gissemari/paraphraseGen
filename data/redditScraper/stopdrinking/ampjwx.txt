I have tried to quit many times. At one point I got up to like 100 days. But it just seems useless to me really...all of the sudden mood swings. I research so I know what's happening and I still fail at the process. Furthermore I am a touring musician so there's that. The shit is everywhere in my business even at local gigs I do. I just feel so helpless at times. Sometimes I feel strong but not lately..especially after this relapse. All I want to do is just be as reclusive as possible. I do find temporary spurts of strength coming here but that quickly goes away when I think about how I am going to sustain. I guess I haven't gotten the one day at a time thing down yet. This is so agonizing..any tips would be great...IWNDWYT

When around alcohol and I feel doubt coming I am down to one thing: whiteknuckling *for this next hour I will not drink*..IWNDWYT 
The mood swings will pass the crappy feelings will pass because those things happen when I quit.  I liked to assure myself that feeling ick about things was totally normal so how do I go about feeling the best I can right now since I refuse to take a drink?  I drank a lot of water and I drank whatever else I felt like too (I did find caffeine just made my edgier though at first I only drank coffee before noon after a while I switched over to decaf).  I read books to occupy my stubborn mind.  I took vitamins.  They say L glutamine helps reduce cravings whether it dies or not it sure is remarkably good for health anyhow.  Id take a quick walk even across the room.  I would find distractions getting extremely involved in the smallest of tasks.  Even a half hour or a 15 minute distraction was one more chunk of time under my belt.  Good luck on your tour sounds exciting!  There are other musicians who have quit I used to like to keep my role models in mind as examples of people who made it outta this mess.  Great job on 4 days!  You're on a roll : ). It's easier to keep an object in motion keep on rolling!
