So I spent some time in treatment where we went to meetings every night. Now I grew up in AA but the first time I went to a meeting as an alcoholic was a panel at the hospital...After I got out I went to a few meetings with my dad but we both got busy and stopped going. This is sort of the heart of my dilemma. I felt pressured to get a sponsor and work the steps and a lot of sharing reinforces that as I'm sure a lot of you know...Fast forward several months and I'm still unemployed. I have a few friends but only one that still lives in town. For my continued recovery I know I need to improve my support network and get involved in some sort of community. I don't dislike going to meetings but I'm not ready to commit to the program and I don't feel like I get anything out of most sharing...I'm not really looking for advice I just wanted to vent a little. I am planning to go to at least a couple meetings a month since I have to convince my dad to go (my only means of transport). Anyway... I will not drink with you today.

You could contact your local intergroup and let them know you are looking for a ride.  There may be other members available to be of service to you.  Since your dad is also an alcoholic Al-anon is available for coping with that.  Best to you.
