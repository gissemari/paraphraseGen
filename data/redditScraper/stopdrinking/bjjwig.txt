Hello everyone ..I hesitated to post this. I didn't drink for approximately more than a year and a half. Stopped in august 2017. ..I don't want to discourage people who struggle everyday and think you can re-decline and fall in alcohol after almost 2 years of combat. My life has been complicated lately i'm in the middle of a deep depression. Everybody has trouble in his/her life and in my case I said to myself "maybe I could drink tonight". Worst idea ever it's been 2 weeks and I almost drink alcohol everyday. I'm not drinking until i lose consciousness but anyway... ..Hope I'm not falling in the trap again. Can anyone tell me how to reset my badge please ? It really helped me in the first place.

Go to the  badge request in the sidebar.  ..[http://sd.bot.nu/badgedate/](http://sd.bot.nu/badgedate/)..Answer yes to the question about having a  badge and then set the date to whenever you are starting from. ..It's a person so it takes a little while. It also won't seem like it worked to you've complete another day.
Stay strong get back on the wagon I'm sure you will rid your self from alcohol forever. IWNDWYT
