I'm a 27 years old male that was sober for a year without any help just redbulls and cigarrettes. After the year that was in last october I tried to drink again with moderation and failed. I also failed to be sober since then. I kept relapsing worse and worse ever since. Little thing triggered me and always end up spending my money on booze and doing coke with strangers. I always said "this time i'm going to therapy or AA. I'm getting the help that I need. I can't do this alone" but after more than a week I was drinking again...Finally today went to a psychologist because my mother really push me and I was lurking here and said "fuck it I really don't want to kill myself drinking". I'm a really stubborn smartass person. I thought that if a go to therapy AA or something the problem will became real and i will lose. What's to lose? I almost lost everything I have no job little money. ..It went OK because I was thinking that the psychologist was going to tell me all the stuff that I "knew" but he told me something that made me think for a while. "There's a difference between that you like being alone and to getting used to be alone" because I really like to be alone and do all alone. I still think that he is wrong. What is wrong with being alone? Well maybe is that I liked to drink alone but i like to watch movies alone spend time with myself. ..The point of all of this is that I'm really trying this time i'm getting help for real this time. I'm planning to go to AA just give it a shot. Here in Peru I think is really religious and I hate that but it's another useful help...I will not drink with you today.

I am proud of you for taking a new approach and stepping up. I haven't made it a year yet but I hit six months after inpatient and 4 months on my own prior to that. I too cannot do it alone I lost my therapist since I moved but I am trying AA this time... and if that doesn't pan out I am actively looking into Refuge Recovery SMART anything else. I use to never be alone but a few years ago I got married and moved. Husband was military and I was always alone which turned into drinking alone which turned into me being a total hermit and anxiety with leaving the house. No I find that yes I do enjoy my time alone (although it is rare with my current living situation) but also a key so my sobriety is connection... not only on here but IRL too. I forgot how much I enjoyed being around people...... although I am quick to remember at times that I don't particularly car for it haha...Anyway welcome back and I am happy for you.
