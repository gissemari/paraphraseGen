Haven't posted here in a good while thought I'd update y'all on my progress. I haven't had a drink in fifty days! I relapsed January 29th after going 49 days without a drink so this is now the longest I've gone without alcohol in more than two years :D yay! Bout to brew a cuppa tea to celebrate lol

When I first read the title I thought you'd found another way to get high besides alcohol!  .Congratulations!  Enjoy the tea!
Great job!
Well done these milestones feel great dont they? 50 days is no small achievement treat yourself..All the best for your future sobriety.
Well done!
