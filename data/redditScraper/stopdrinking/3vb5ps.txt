I'm 22 and I've been sobering up for about a month. I've had four relapses within that month including last night. this is good timing.

Wow good for you!
Good luck to you!!! Remember that they don't bite but they do hug!
Awesome! The support group I have in AA as well as the step work I did helped me immensely. Have a great time!
Good luck!
If you are half as nervous as I was before I went to my first just know that every single person there has been in your position and knows how hard it is to walk through the door the very first time! I'm reasonably confident it'll go very well :)

Congrats!
Have fun and let us know how it went!
Awesome! I love AA. I hope you enjoy your time there. 
If you don't mind me asking how early did you start drinking? I'm 25 and I always think it's interesting when young people decide to become sober. There's almost a taboo about it seeing as we "just turned 21" and "how could we possibly know if we have a problem yet we just started drinking." We all have our own ghosts both sorry to see you here &amp; also very glad to see you here :) congrats on making good choices
That's awesome good for you! Maybe do a follow up post with your experience?
How did it go?
