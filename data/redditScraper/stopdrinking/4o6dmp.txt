Weekdays are ok I have lots of busy time and I have no craving for a drink.  It's the unstructured time of evenings and weekends.  I somehow NEED to stop drinking.  I feel nothing but despair right now..

Evenings were my weak times.  Despair at not being able to stop was what I experienced.  Two things made the difference for me : making a *decision* to not drink that night similar to what u/CoolCrosby describes at this link [Baby Steps to Stop](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/); and getting support through meetings.  Going to a meeting at night made all the difference for me...Just for today I don't drink with you.
I don't work and am on summer break from grad school so most of my days are unstructured. It helps me to make a goal for the day even if it's something small (e.g. shower and pay bills have coffee with my sister etc.). On the weekends I've gone hiking strawberry picking gone to movies - but if I don't plan something it's easy for me to get bored and want to drink or just sit around and get depressed which also sucks.
