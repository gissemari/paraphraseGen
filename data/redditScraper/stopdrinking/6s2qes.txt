So I'm really just needing to vent this is a warning;  if bitching bothers you move on to another post. ..I'm 28 living back with my parents bc of a decision I selflessly made 18 months ago. I've been fully aware of my inability to moderate my drinking since I was 20. By 23 I was a full-blown raging alcoholic that knew I wouldnt make it to my 30's without either killing myself or killing someone else as a consequence to feeding my addiction. I got kicked out of my parent's house at 23 for continuing to drink after being told to either quit 100% or get kicked out the second it was made known I gave in and had a drink.  Forced to stay with a friend out of state at this time in my life I had just began talking to my now (?) girlfriend. A few months later we started dating and I moved in with her. I had never been in a relationship with anyone that had a child already and quite frankly I never wanted to be in a relationship where a child from a previous relationship was involved. I want my partner to focus on their happiness and my happiness first I didn't want to be second in line. Well a few months into our relationship my gf had expressed genuine concern for my drinking and I felt real supported by her. I could feel her supportive energy and it helped me to realize my strength and ability to be stronger than the desire and the temptation to drink. I stopped drinking 4/20/2013 and stayed sober until 2/13/16. ..Without going into my gf's personally business 3 weeks into 2016 her daughter had to go with other family members bc of false accusations made by her father - who decided to pop back into her life after being absent 3/4 of her life. As part of a stipulation I had to move out of our family home in order for my gf's daughter to have a CHANCE at coming back to our home. So after more than 3 years of a broken relationship with my parents i had no other options for places to live other than back with my mom and dad. I bit the bullet and moved back in Feb 2013. I love back into a house where my dad is a functioning self-riteuous alcoholic and my mom is a self-loathing self-absorbed alcoholic. I did this so my gf could have her daughter back. ..By Feb 13 2016 I managed to loosen my tight grip I had on sobriety just enough to get blackout drunk crash my car and end the night with a DUI with a BAC of .398. A week locked up without a car without a license and still living with my parents (I'm not sure what planets had to have aligned for them to let me still live there.) made my desire to stay sober at one of it's weakest  times. The hardest part was not being able to be with my girlfriend. We had lived together for over three years by then I couldn't remember the last time we didn't fall asleep under the same roof. And now  the 40 minute drive from my parent's house to our house may as well have been 4000 minutes away since I couldn't drive anymore. We got through every day though some ended in tears some ended in deeper love every day felt longer than the last. ..Fast forward >> >> tonight.... sober since my DUI 18 months. I'm still fucking here at my parent's house. Gf's daughter is back at our house but I'm still at my mommy and daddy's house??!! I walked into the kitchen earlier as my dad was pouring his rum and he knows it's hard for me right now yet he can't be respectful enough to try to hide it a little better. Well you know where that will lead any alcoholic next... 20 minutes later as I walked through the kitchen this time I looked for where he was hiding the rum. Idk why my brain tells me to look for where it is I really don't want to know bc it just makes it harder when I know where his stash is. I'm  struggling right now. I could too easily steal some rum and he wouldnt know the difference. ..I know I'll stay sober tonight but it's one of the hardest days I've had in a long time. I'll be stronger tomorrow bc of the struggles of today. ..

Very similar situation here. Lived with my girlfriend for 1 year and dated for 2.5 years. She lied constantly and cheated on me and it made me spiral out of control &amp; I started to self-medicate I was sober before moving in with her. Now back at my parents house (both are alcoholics) and received my 2nd DWI last friday (.228 BAC); the first one happened 8 years ago when I was 18. Since being back home for the last 2.5 months I have dropped all of my negative influencing friends and started attending AA; you should attend too even if you're having mere temptations. Someone recently posted in 1 of my previous threads "you're only 26 still young its not too late to reinvent yourself" I wish I would've started reinventing myself 2 days ago but better late than never. Don't give up hope! Find a higher power! Exercise &amp; meditate! For me I live by the trifecta "peace love and positivity" if I have those 3 things I will be golden. It takes effort of course nothing comes to those who don't actively pursue their desires. I believe you're strong just like me. I have been sober before on my own but this time I need extra help.
