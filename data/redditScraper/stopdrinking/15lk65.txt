check out that post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/15ke5a/planning_my_future_relapse/) for a primer on the topic...i will be one yet sober on January 18th. and i think my thought process is somewhat similar to the OP in that post but also quite different...I have no desire to drink but i do find myself thinking about it in one certain situation. I am seeing this girl who is a lucky one and rarely rarely drinks and is sober otherwise. I'm talking she maybe has a glass or two of wine once a month. we talked about this and she asked if that would be a problem because she is supportive of my sobriety. i have no problem i said she can drink as much as she wishes. i don't let others actions affect my sobriety. ..But it got me thinking about my whole state of affairs. Alcohol is not my drug of choice; weed is. i am basically avoiding alcohol so that i don't slip up and start smoking again. ..so i am trying to weigh the merits of having one glass of wine with my girlfriend on a special occasion? she doesnt smoke and i have completely changed my circle of friends and none of them smoke. I was the type of person in the past who could have just one beer or one glass of wine and stop. with weed i cannot stop. ..so r/stopdrinking please school me. correct my thinking. tell me what to say to myself. tell me what to say to her. anything would be appreciated. cheers...edit: well simply typing this out (as usual) has caused me to see the error of my thinking. If i were to have 1 drink (and only one) it would make it much easier for me to say yes if offered pot. or maybe i might even seek it out. i know if i smoke pot i won't stop. therefore to reduce risk don't drink. explain this to the gf if she ever asks if i want a glass of wine(which she hasn't). simple. Thanks r/stopdrinking. i'm glad i have a place to bounce my thoughts off of. you rule

Kind of like me. If I smoked pot again I know I would surely drink. Probably best if we both stear clear of those evils.
A drug is a drug is a drug.  For me anyways  start with one go to others go overboard on all of them..Say to her it's ok and try not to drool too much when she doesn't finish her glass of wine ask her if its ok to stare at her breasts instead. .Hope that she laughs..Alcohol was my gateway drug. Gateway to oblivion.   Your dis ease is fucking with your head I think.
Ticket resolved and case closed. Good job ;-)
