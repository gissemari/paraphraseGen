 Well......I am back everyone. Did you miss me lol I am back to day one. I just can't make it stick. Doesn't help that my husband drinks although his relationship with alcohol is normal. He can have one drink and stop. Recently went on vacation and it was wonderful and fun. We visited wineries and had a drink with every dinner. I didn't over do it though. I was able to have one drink with dinner or do a wine tasting and stop. Probably because we were doing other things. We were hiking exploring and relaxing. Get back home and it's back to where I was before......drinking every day and not just one glass with dinner either. My husband is wonderful but he doesn't understand that I just can't stop drinking so much...."just have one and stop". I could on vacation because there were so many things to enjoy and explore. Now it's back to work and the evening chores of dinner cleaning and laundry. I know I need to find time for myself and to do things like go for a walk or whatever but by the time I finish all my daily responsibilities it's time for bed. Get up the next morning and do it all over again..........ugghhhhh. I just feel so defeated and so very alone. I don't have many friends and without alcohol I find it hard to make friends. Plus my daily responsibilities leave me with little down time. I know deep down in my soul that I am just making excuses......the demon is struggling to keep control.....and I am struggling to find myself again. Well thanks for reading/listening to me ramble. I think I will read This Naked Mind again. Hopefully I will find myself before it's too late!

It is hard when you live with a normal drinker. They do not get it because they are not programmed that way. I love This Naked Mind!! IWNDWYT
Yep...I wonder how  Groundhog Day  syndrome affects many of us. I know that I as well as my sibling are single-single parents and this affects both of us greatly.  I know that I neglected any degree of self care in the past and I am working hard to remedy that.  I'm sure many people feel this way. You are absolutely not alone!  We can find ourselves/better selves again!!!
