for once my flair is correct.  I'm really not quite sure how I've gone this long without drinking.  I am going to chock it up to dogged persistence.  I tell myself each and every day that I absolutely will not drink...what is different this time than the last times I've tried to quit is the post-qutting withdraw.  Before I would feel lousy for a week then ride the pink cloud for about a month before relapsing.  This time things are different.  I still feel like like I am standing in quicksand.  I have issues sleeping I have no motivation to eat right or exercise or really do anything for that matter.  I've been spending what money I would have been spending on booze on an old hobby of mine.  Though I still feel completely lethargic toward that hobby or really anything it seems to help.  I obsess over something else throughout the day instead of how quickly I can get to the store after work to pick up moonshine.  ..this post sounds more depressing than it really is.  I am improving slowly.  The point I am trying to make is that with each relapse the recovery time gets progressively longer.  I never paid attention to "kindling" before now.  Here I am 50 days out and I am still not back up to speed.  I know I will get there eventually but goodness am I finally appreciative of how serious this disease is...thank you everyone for posting.  I don't contribute much but reading posts on this sub every day has really helped me stay grounded.

Congrats on the 50 days! This sub is the reason I am sober. I am thankful for it and all who post. I don't think that I am up to speed yet either. I plan on starting an exercise regiment Tuesday. I eat fairly healthy just have to step up the physical.  But we have accomplished quite a feat in not drinking.  Keep going!
Congratulations on your half-century; it's a great start on a whole new way of life.
