Get to my dad's house and I'm just hit with the realization that I don't know how to be around these people without a drink in my hand. Everyone is in their rooms and there is just booze sitting around this is the closest I've been to a drink. My brain is telling me I could get away with it I could just make a drink and go back to my room without anyone back at my sober house knowing. Gahhhh this sucks.

That voice you're hearing is the alcoholic in your brain trying to get fed. You see that voice belongs to the part of you that feeds off of alcohol. It is not your friend. It does not like you. It does not want to help you. It's simply hungry. It wants food. **Starve that little bastard.** And then go get an ice cream cone. Because ice cream is awesome.
Stay strong my friend. Being at my parents is the time I feel most like having a drink too. We must always stay vigilant.
Go watch some TV or read some other parts here and Terry to help someone else. Anything to get you out of yourself. Take a walk I'm aware it is cold. ..I promise that if you can make it through tonight you will be glad you did.

They won't know....but do YOU want that choice weighing on your conscience? Just get through tonight. You can do it.
You never have to have another drink again. Even if you want to. Put something else in your hand and make it through today.
Think forward. Remember what happens when you drink. Taking one drink won't be enough and then what? You will eventually get all your misery back. It is poison for us.
If my brain were telling me that I could "get away with it" another part of my brain would be screaming: "Bullshit get to an AA meeting."  Not only that I would go.
I know we have a strong group from Chicago here. Perhaps they could suggest some meetings for you of off you a local contact for support.
