So I've been sober for 6 years now. I've learned a lot about myself in that time and the cravings are minimal. One thing I still struggle with though and seems to be characteristic of those on /r/teetotal as well is talking to people at parties or even small social gatherings...It feels like whenever someone has a glass of alcohol in their hand or worse I can smell it on their breath it feels like I'm "not on the same level" as them and it makes it very difficult to feel comfortable talk because I'm instantly reminded of my sobriety.

What do you mean by level? Like sobriety level?
