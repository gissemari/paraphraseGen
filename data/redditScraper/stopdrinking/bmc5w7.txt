Don't get me wrong I don't blame them.  I spent years hiding and lying about my addictions so it's only natural for them to build better safe-guards in order to not to be fooled again.  I often hear "I can always tell when you've been drinking" which I know with 100% certainty isn't the case.  Also how could someone know that they didn't know?  Seems fallacious to me.  I guess that this is what I deserve justice in a weird sort of way.  I made that bed of mistrust so I shouldn't bitch about sleeping in it..Hope you all are well. =)

I like the look that says  let's see how long you stay sober...' or the convo that says  I'd stayed sober / didn't smoke for ...... years then came back to the fold'. Bitch good for you for staying sober that long but can you please not do what you just did? It's one of the reasons only one or two people know I'm sober.
I thought the same.  I got away with plenty of hidden drinking.  They never knew ALL the times...  Oh pride of mine why would that even matter.  The fact that I was busted a fraction of the times doesn't matter anymore.  They are not my keepers... Why would they need to expend any energy to try and know I was drinking...  Why would I expect them to openly share their realization of me hiding my drunk?  I wasn't worth their time... They knew I was a drunk... They just stopped inviting me to anything.  Much less in my face than getting busted but looking back now....  Yeah. They KNEW.
I told very few people that I quit drinking as I did not wish to add additional pressure to myself or disappoint others.  No one ever asked me if I had been drinking after I quit.  We make our own triggers.
