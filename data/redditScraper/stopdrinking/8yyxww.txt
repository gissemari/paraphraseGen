I am just getting mad about this. I just took a leave from work because my coworkers are drinking way too much. And after one day I just realised that my GF is getting on my nerves so much that I had a relapse. Is that the word ? I think so. ..This is getting so deeply in my mind that i can't find a way to deal with it. I tried everything. The doctor and its weird therapy which brought nothing but quitting cocaine which may not have been that bad if it was not with the loss of a rolex because of madness and alcohol. ..The only good stuff of those two last years was that I bought my own fucking flat. I'am in debt for 25 years now but well this does not make any sense to me. I am at home. For the first time in more than 15 years. And depressed as fuck...I guess I'll spend the time sorting the 75 000 pictures I took in two years to find a few ones making me think it was worth it...I am so mad about my work and my coworker who are drinking like hell because it's fun. It seems that none of them did have a blank-memory night from which they can't remember shit. I am the only one to whom bad shit happened ? Maybe are they lying about it. Or they don't have the honesty to admit it. This really drives me mad...I should really focus on that therapy. It does not make any sense. Parano a may not help. This is what they say. Is that what I say ? ..The last few appointements with the real doctor the one having its PHD and being authorized to deliver drugs ended the same way. "Do you need any drug ?" I don't know how they say that above. Anyway. I have my little stach at home. Damn fuckin stach. Time is going on so fast. ..Ce que c'est agr able de formuler en anglais. C'est. Diff rent. J'ai lu cela quelque part. L'usage d'une autre langue permet d'instaurer un certain filtre de neutralit  au regard des lacunes de connaissance de la richesse d'une autre langue...Je me fais un peu chier en France en ce moment non ? Un peu ouais. L'anglais me manque. Enfin l  je suis coinc  dans un trou. ..There is one thing that makes quitting so hard to achieve. Availability...How the fuck is the product available ? And which one is the most available ? ..L'alcool.

It's a great challenge. Believe like we all do that you are worth it. You can conquer the beast for one day right?  Just 1!  Do that today. Or tomorrow if you're not sober yet. Just don't drink for one day. Rinse repeat. Watch your badge grow. IWNDWYT 
One day at a time friend.  One day at a time.  I won't drink with you today.
