This is the number of steps on my Fitbit right now for today. ..Had an awesome 5 mile walk/jog with my dog first thing this morning after coffee and my checkin. Ended up going to Home Depot 3 times for mulch flowers and potting soil. Got the ugly mini-jungles that were supposed to be flower beds in front of my house cleaned out and looking sharp. Cleaned up a bunch of old flower pots that were in the garage and got them full of soil and fresh flowers and out on the deck. My laundry is done. My lunches for the next week are in the Instant Pot right now. ..If I'd drank that tequila I thought I wanted so much yesterday I *MIGHT MAYBE* have accomplished half of that. More likely I'd be doing hair of the dog shots right now and watching YouTube with the curtains closed to keep the sun out. I wanted that stupid tequila so badly I could practically taste it could practically feel the burn in my belly. So not worth it. Thanks again for being there for me in my struggle SD. I think if I had not turned to y'all I'd probably still have gotten through it sober but it would have been a much sadder and lonelier ordeal. I'm so glad I didn't drink with y'all yesterday and I will not drink with y'all today! I love you.

Wow I thought I was doing well with 16000 steps  ..Well done.  Isn't it great actually doing things on a Sunday.?
You know what's a really disgusting thought... In my 1000+ days clean that's roughly the number of standard drinks I haven't consumed. 
You had a productive day and lost at least a lb.  WTG!!!
And to top it off a lovely Palindrome 131!..Well done Belinda keep up the good work!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Brilliant for not drinking the tequila. Fantastic post . Many useful insights that I can use in my daily real life. You are a treasure in my fragile recovery.
