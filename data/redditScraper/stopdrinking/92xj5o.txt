Yesterday I was throwing a sober dinner party.  Had a great productive morning going to the farmers market and cooking and cleaning with my sober girlfriend.  She went to take nap in the afternoon and after an hour the though came in.  I could sneak out to the corner store buy a small vodka (200ml) and be able to get away with it.  I knew I could sober up by dinner and disguise the smell...  what the fuck?  Where did that come from?  I knew the answer and immediately called a buddy in the program and laughed about how ridiculous that was and how quickly I would be back to daily drinking!  I have relapsed plenty of times over not calling when the small thought comes in.  It felt so freeing to be honest about it and not let it grow into a 500 pound gorilla!..Thanks for listening and I will not drink with you today!

Yeah.  Been there.  It amazing how those 200ml bottles turn into 400ml which I then turn into 750ml.  My head goes there way too much!
