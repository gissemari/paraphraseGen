I realize this book has been discussed here many times but with people trying to make new years resolutions to stop drinking.  I figured it was a good time to give the book a shout out...For 10 years I felt the need to get drunk pretty much every night..Around 4 years ago I realized I needed to stop. I tried will power. Tried AA.  These things may work for you...But for me Allen Carr's Easy Way to Control Alcohol was the key. Instead of reading I listened to it on my morning commute. (I used audible's app)..I highly recommend this book for anybody who has been struggling with willpower and is ready for a change...It gives you real steps it can follow that any clear thinking individual can use to make changes in their life

I liked it too. I liked This Naked Mind a bit better. I still relapsed after reading those but they definitely make it easier to quit and stay sober for longer than before I read those books. They changed the way I think about alcohol or at least planted a great seed that makes me rethink everything.
I couldn't get into it &amp; it didn't help. But I know it helps a lot of people. Different personalities I guess! The book 30 Day Sobriety Solution helped a lot!
I'm reading it now. Not sure what I expected but it's an interesting read for sure!
I used his easy way to quit smoking. Worked for me!  I tell everyone who wants to quit smoking to check it out.
