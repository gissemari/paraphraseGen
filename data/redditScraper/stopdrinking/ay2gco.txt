  ..**TLDR: I am 2 years sober! I am proud of my accomplishment but it wasn't always easy. When I first started I honestly couldn't imagine this day. The truth is my life is basically the same as before I quit drinking but WAY easier to manage! And I've had some significant successes that I'm certain alcohol would have derailed.** ..Today I celebrate 2 years of actually taking care of myself. 2 years of discovering who I am as a person and realizing I'm pretty okay with it even though I am not the same as I was when I was drinking and some relationships have changed as a result. And it's been 2 years of ups and downs with my feelings sometimes loving sobriety sometimes struggling in it but never wavering on the fact that I am now a person who doesn't drink. I looked back at some of my entries here on SD as well as my early journals and I thought I'd share a timeline for those who may be at the very beginning of their journey and wondering if it ever gets better (it does). I remember when I first started reading posts here I'd see users with hundreds or even thousands of days and it just baffled my mind. Before I quit I couldn't even go one day. Now I've gone 730 days but they all came one at a time. Don't worry about the big numbers; just worry about today. Now here's a snapshot of my 2 years of sobriety:..**Day 1 (journal):** Three weeks ago I went to the doctor about my drinking and was prescribed antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication. I was also set up with a therapist at the clinic. Since that first doctor's visit I've tried to stop drinking. Last week I was able to go without alcohol for 4 days which is a big step for me. I was able to get up Saturday teach at the college ride my motorcycle hike in the woods and go to a hockey game without day-drinking beforehand. I was feeling really good about my progress. Last week a psychiatrist prescribed Naltrexone for alcohol abuse. Supposedly it will decrease the "feel good" feeling that alcohol gives you. I decided to try it Saturday night at the hockey game but I'm not sure that it helped much as I still over-consumed although I never got blackout drunk as I normally would. Sunday was a complete mess and the exact opposite of all of Saturday's activities. I literally could not get off the couch and couldn't even eat anything. It really showed me that I just can't drink if I want to live a life like Saturday instead of like Sunday...**Day 2 (journal):** Today's assignment in The 30-Day Sobriety Solution book is to create a vision of the Before Me (the me who drank excessively). So here it is: ..I use alcohol to help me fit in. I often feel bad about myself like I'm not funny or interesting enough so I drink to feel like I am part of a group. I am concerned about the consequences of my drinking primarily my health as my dad died at 41 from alcohol. I have gained a significant amount of weight since I started drinking heavily primarily in my belly which I never had before. This makes me so unhappy with myself and my appearance. I'm also concerned about my relationships with my husband and son. I don't want them to walk away from me. I've been drunk when I should have been having a meaningful time with my son. I've gotten into arguments with my husband while drunk and sometimes I have blacked out and don't recall conversations at all. I isolate a lot so they don't see how much I drink. In fact I hide a lot of my drinking. My family would probably say I drink too much but they don't necessarily know to what extent. Although it's possible I'm not hiding it as well as I think. I also drink and drive which is very dangerous. I hate the way my face looks when I'm drunk - slitty eyes puffy red cheeks. And I hate the way I look when I'm hungover - red-faced red-lipped and tired. When I'm hungover I'm extremely short-tempered and I am constantly thinking of when I can have my next drink. I've left work early to drink and I've drank on my lunch break. I don't accomplish near as much as I dream of not at work at home or at the gym. I dream of many things but I don't act on much because I'm either drunk or hungover. I am a terrible role model for my son and I fear him going down the same path or turning away from me completely. When I drink I become incredibly depressed about the life I'm not living and I feel worthless. I become suicidal when I drink heavily and I sometimes sob uncontrollably...**1 month (journal):** I've been sober 1 month. I've been sticking to my plan of reading posts in SD on Reddit taking my meds and seeing my therapist. For the first time maybe ever I'm feeling good in sobriety not feeling like I'm missing out on something. I see other people drink to excess and it makes me feel good that I'm not doing that anymore. I admit with summer approaching patio drinking barbecues and other outdoor events will likely give me the urge. I'm committed to working through them so I don't go back to where I started...**2 months (SD post):** Tonight I found myself totally irritated at everything. I went from snapping responses to wanting to cry for literally no reason except this: I want to escape this feeling. I know that a drink would take this edge off. I've come too far to give in but fuck this is hard. Being in my feelings and living life as it comes is hard. When asked if I was angry all I could say was "Everything is irritating me and I can't drink so I just gotta deal with it."..**3 months (SD post):** Last night was the closest I've come to drinking. I was at a wedding with an open bar and I was upset because I didn't feel like my SO was paying me enough attention. I feel like I've become quite needy these last few months. Like I need to be told I'm beautiful I need to be made to feel important. I think I used to fill this need with booze. It worked pretty well most of the time...**6 months (SD post):** Six months ago I couldn't imagine life without a drink. I was in such despair that the only thing that kept me from ending it all was the promise of another drink. I hated who I was and felt totally and utterly hopeless. I was scared to die and also scared of continuing to live the life I was leading with all those terrible thoughts and uncontrollable urges. So I did the bravest thing I ever did. I asked for help. Over the last 6 months I've gone from crying fits because I couldn't drink and avoiding social gatherings where I knew I'd be tempted to choosing sobriety and loving who I am and feeling totally at home in my own skin. Six months ago I felt like there was no light at the end of the tunnel. All I could see was impending doom. But thanks to a supportive spouse a caring doctor a team of helpful mental health professionals and the right medication I'm out of the tunnel. And wow does the sunshine feel great...**1 year (SD post):** Yesterday I was having a terrible day emotionally. I couldn't really pinpoint what the real problem was but everything was getting on my nerves. Add in a silly disagreement with my spouse and all I could think was "I need a drink!" It's been more than a year since I employed that coping mechanism but my brain hasn't forgotten. It's still the go-to thought when I'm upset. It was a quick fix for just about any discomfort. But it comes with a price of course...**And today:** Life is generally the same as it was before I quit. I have the same friends I work at the same company and I'm still married with a (now mostly grown) son. My rock bottom was not some catastrophic  this is your life!  moment that I know others have experienced. But my rock bottom was killing me from the inside. When my father died at 41 from excessive drinking I was 13 years old and I didn't know he had a problem. He didn't get a DUI or become abusive when he drank or lose his family or his house. But his consumption was riddling his organs. I knew that my level of drinking was likely doing the same to my body and I was engineering the same end: dying suddenly (or worse   slowly) in a hospital bed. I spent a lot of time working on my health through regular exercise and diet so I did sometimes feel that I  wasn't that bad.  But when I drank there seemed to be a number of drinks that would help me feel  normal  in social situations and a number of drinks that would put me on a shame spiral that often included thoughts of suicide and I never recognized that line in time to stop crossing it. My son was a teenager at the time and I couldn't bear to cause him the lifetime of pain that my own father had caused me by leaving too soon...Over the last 2 years the most significant changes in my life have been achieving and maintaining a normal weight for my body taking care of myself physically and emotionally (I still see a psychiatrist  cause shit ain't fixed just because I don't drink!) and getting a promotion at work that came with a new role that I love along with more money vacation and flexibility. My son moved into his first apartment last fall but I was glad we could connect for the 18 months or so I was sober before he moved out and we continue to have a close relationship. The introvert in me still struggles to socialize without alcohol and in some ways that has challenged my relationships as I'm not the outgoing party girl I was once but I will take that over the agonizing hangovers full-blown anxiety and emotional turmoil that I suffered on a daily basis. I also feel more honest in my relationships as I'm being myself I'm there for people who need me and I always remember conversations...Most days I don't think about drinking. I just consider it not an option. I am still human and I still have challenges but I can manage them a hell of a lot easier when I take alcohol out of the mix. If you're just starting out like I was on Day 1 hang in there. You will have ups and downs but in the end you'll feel more in control of your life and your fate when you live in sobriety. ..**Best wishes to all and thank you for your posts that have inspired me and kept me accountable these last two years.**

Congratulations!! You inspire me!
Brilliant read  thanks for sharing :) x 
Congratulations on Your Sober Solar Circumnavigations!!
Congratulations on two years of freedom    
Read every word of that. Thank you. 
What a great account of your last 2 years in sobriety!!    
I hope to be where you are one day! Congrats!
This is great. I love how you show the journey (so far). When I quit the first tine I fell prey to the  I want to drink' around the one year mark and unfortunately fell back into it...I'm at nearly six months and much more wary around those thoughts...Also I think there's something quite wonderful about the fact not much has changed for you! I think that's such an important message in a way. ..I think many of us go into sobriety thinking that our whole lives will have to shift but in the end it's mostly the same just without hangovers and long nights in bars...I think one of the greatest messages is to say - sobriety doesn't have to change much but it can also change everything for the better! ..Amazing work on the two years! IWNDWYT. 
Thanks for sharing! When you did have an urge to drink what did you do instead? Drink tea? Eat something? I'm trying to pop a frozen grape in my mouth instead of pouring a drink. All it does is just postpone the inevitable. I'm able to skip the shot before work and the one right after but if there's a game on or 9pm comes around that craving takes over. 
Thank you for the share. I'm coming up on 30 days for what seems like my millionth time but for the first time I'm feeling really good about it. That said I accidentally ended up in a photo album of an old ex and went through the whole thing because I'm a dummy. My mind has been racing all afternoon that it hates this feeling and a drink would sure take the edge off. It's nice to hear that even you still struggled with that thought much longer term and that I'll be ok if I just recognize it as a negative feeling it's fine I'll make it through and I definitely do not need a drink to "fix" it. 
I am just starting out and relate to your first few entries. This really gives me hope. Congratulations on your journey and thanks for sharing. 
Congratulations on two years!
Thank you
Thank you! This inspires me to write! Really appreciate you sharing!
Thank you so much for posting this! We often only see snapshots and I had a hunch it couldn't only be the celebratory milestones and proud moments that lie ahead. It's good to have a more realistic view. ..Congratulations on two years! 
Thank you for this. This process is hard and scary but for some reason reading about others who have succeeded longer than I sometimes feel possible helps me to hold on.
Congratulations!  Did you ever go to AA meetings and if so what was your experience? 
Congrats on 2 years! IWNDWYT 
Thanks for sharing! Very inspiring!!! Good Luck and Stay  ! IWNDWYT 
I really needed to read this. Thank you iwndwy
I too read every word.  I really relate.  I'm an x party girl introvert too!  Your line about life being basically the same resonated as well as my rock bottom wasn't so awful either but I was heading in the wrong direction for sure.  .The one thing that I think is really improving but not tangible is the effect my no drinking has on my kids.  It can't hurt!
This is such a great post! Congratulations! IWNDWYT. &lt;3
Well done!
Thank you!  You've opened my eyes to a much brighter future. 
Wow great timeline to reference how it all changes as you go along. I really enjoyed reading about you. It's easy to forget that it will.be hard sometimes when I'm on a good streak. It's okay we are human...I will not drink with you today!  
Thank you for posting this!
What a beautiful post.  Thank You for sharing.
Congratulations!i can totally relate. Thanks for sharing. 
Wow! An incredible read and a mirrored reflection  of why I have begun this journey myself. I'm so proud of you and hope that in the future I can post such a read. For now my future is getting through today without reaching for the alcohol  soother . But I have pledged so IWNDWYT. 
Well done..I read it all too. I thought this was spot on: "Don't worry about the big numbers; just worry about today". Good stuff! 
Thank you for sharing. This is a very powerful post. IWNDWYT
Thank you. I'm just starting out. My health is a concern. I just realized that no matter how great I eat and how much I work out it's all for nothing when I drown my organs in poison. ..Thank you for sharing all that!
This is a wonderful read. Thank you. Congratulations to you as well. 
Thanks so much for posting this. Very real and honest.
Thank you!
