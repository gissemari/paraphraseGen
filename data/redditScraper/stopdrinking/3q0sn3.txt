So today is day 15 of my sobriety until now things are going good. I went to a concert last night (Hanzel und Gretyl an industrial metal band who really celebrates drinking pouring beer in the audience drining heavily on stage etc.) and I was one of the very few sober people in the whole club. It was still really fun altough I must admit that I would have liked to have a beer or two (or you know twelve... there's a reason I quit haha). But I didn't I just had coke instead (Coca Cola not cocaine lol). Even some of my friends who don't usually drink all that much were pretty much shitfaced and altough I had fun it still felt kind of weird to be sober around them. The good thing is that no one tried to make me drink or anything no one even so much as asked questions. That kind of surprised me because they know that it's usual for me to be the most drunk of us. I half expected them to be surprised by the fact that I wasn't already plastered when they arrived since I was at the show an hour or so before them.  ..I even met one dude I rarely see and told him I wasn't drinking tonight - turns out he also quit a couple of months ago he even went to rehab and stuff. Was pretty surprised but it was nice to know that I wasn't the only one struggling. I told him about "playing it forward" he seemed intrigued by the idea. Maybe it will help him as well...I also put some energy in job hunting the last two weeks and I was invited to take a test for an apprenticeship next month. I sure hope this goes well an apprenticeship in combination with the evening school I go to would really make up for some of the time I wasted by getting drunk the last decade or so...So in conclusion I feel like things are going in the right direction for me since I quit drinking. While I still would like to have some beers every now and then (my favourite brewery opens a bar in my town in a couple of weeks fml what terrible timing lol) the advantages heavily outweigh the bad parts keeping that in mind makes it a lot easier for me not to relapse...Have a good day everyone and stay strong!..

Glad to hear that things are going so well! Congratulations. I would definitely be hesitant for myself to hang out where there is a lot of drinking in early sobriety. But I also understand that seeing concerts is awesome and lots of people do so sober!
Great job on staying strong.  Also good luck with getting the apprenticeship.
