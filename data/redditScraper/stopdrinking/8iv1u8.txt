A quick backstory here I won't bore you all with the extreme details. ..I began drinking when I was 14. All throughout high school and indeed the first two years of college I regularly indulged but overall I didn't do it to excess but maybe 4-6 times a year. Teenagers do that. Before 18 I was maybe black out twice. It is important to add that during this time I was very socially aware. Anxiety? That's what **other people** get. I had no difficulties in social situations with friends with girls. Then in my sophomore year of college it changed. I wanted to kill that bar or my friend's alcohol supply. Instead of a reset button that it was for so many years alcohol became a challenge. Give me a beer I'll drink eleven of them just out of spite. ..This continued throughout college and slowly and surely I realized that my ability to socialize without alcohol was changing.... but that was okay as long as I could socialize during drinking.... right? No. While I was never a chronic drinker I took my sparse sporadic drinking to more extremes. I killed relationships friendships. I'm lucky to have the few that still stuck around. ..Two years ago I killed another very close relationship with my binge drinking. I got black out. I remember nothing of it. I quit relapsed and quit again seven months ago...All has been good. I can go to the bars with my wife and friends and live vicariously through them. I truly enjoy watching them have fun while I sip Red Bulls and drive them around town as a cheuffeur. I enjoy spending time with family while they drink because of the stories that come from it. I enjoy going to restaurants while my friends/wife are drinking and have crazy conversations. ..I thought my sobriety was going well until I realized that my social anxiety outside of this small group of friends and my wife and a very few select members of my family had completely collapsed. I've never felt this kind of anxiety before. It's completely crippling and as of the last two months it's infected my friends group as well. I can't read people as well as I used to I take offense to small slights and I worry constantly about what I'm going to say. ..Tonight for example some friends and I went to the bar to celebrate a big event in our lives (I graduated with my second degree). We went to one bar it was fine and then at the second bar everyone started mingling with other groups.... and I fucking fell apart. Not being able to drink made it so that I could not replace the false social awareness I once had with ones that were natural. I could not mingle with classmates yet again I could not mingle with their friends I could not mingle with my own friends I even wanted to be away from my wife. ..And it didn't just happen tonight. It's happened periodically over the last couple months in classes at family functions with my own brothers and sisters. No matter where I am surrounded by alcohol or not surrounded by alcohol I find myself having such difficulty with social interactions now. I get angry over things I overreact to things I find myself questioning my own personality. ..Thing is years ago I was at a point where I was able to mingle and complete these interactions without alcohol. Now I cannot reclaim that. Does this happen to people after getting sober? Is it odd that it's happening to someone who was a binge alcoholic vs. a chronic alcoholic? How can I begin moving forward to reclaim who I once was? ..Seven months but these last two months have been torture. Not that I want to return to drinking necessarily it almost ruined my life....  but that I can't figure out how to create feelings of happiness and regain my composure because so many of my recent years I **replaced** these skills with alcohol.... how do I become the Hydrobear I once was without alcohol? What are others' experiences in this realm?  ..(I will generally disregard any posts stating to avoid bars. That's not what I'm trying to figure out. The fact that these things happen in both non-drinking and drinking settings freaked me out that example was just the most recent of my failure to thrive socially with my sobriety).

Congrats on 7 months! This whole thing is quite a ride I think! For me it is taking time and all along the way (so far) I have found myself in a constant state of change. I think it is because even though we are building time our bodies and our brains need more time to repair the damage we have done over the years - which I am surmising results in some funky "spots" - I.E. struggling with anxiety getting lost in the social thing...I am finding that I too am not as good at navigating social situations right now as I was a few months ago. For me I am chalking it up to the healing process continuing to keep at it and try to be thoughtful when I fall. My SO is a great sounding board (even if I don't necessarily want to hear what is being said it is helpful to have a straight opinion - they too are sober which helps as they understand this whole crazy ride) Hang in there Hydro my thought is if we keep at it we will get there and when we get there it will be so much better than we ever realized!!
A few yrs ago (whether I was drinking or not) I developed  flop sweats  just out of the blue.  They happened in any new situation or in any social setting even with friends.   This was a big deal because I have had to make presentations to groups most of my life.  ..Saw a psychiatrist who straightened out my anxiety right away with meds.  He's still working the depression  but it's better.  Of course those were the issues I was self-medicating with booze for decades.  You can let your GP take a swing at this but psychiatrists work this issue all day long (he also caught my low thyroid which my GP hadn't).  The days of exclusive talk therapy are gone. Now psychs are in the chemical balancing game. ..I tend to think of it as: I lost the Genetic Brain Chemistry Lottery.  Happens.  Get help with it.   ..Just a reminder too.  Alcohol changes our brains.  Getting sober also changes your brain too.  Sometimes things don't change back exactly like they were. Probably most of the time.  Moods is where I notice it the most.  ..
Not a doctor but it sounds like you might benefit from some treatment for anxiety. Meds and meditation have helped me tremendously. I'm not the person I was before booze because i don't feel as much need to escape anxiety and other feelings as that version of myself did.
