As I posted on here several weeks ago it had become clearly obvious to myself and anyone around me consistently that my drinking which was already heavy to begin with had become completely out of control. I went to a physician two weeks  ago today and for the first time in several years was actually honest with a medical professional in regards to the amount I was drinking. He prescribed naltrexone and a low dose of Librium. I also found out I was completely healthy except for my liver enzyme level being insanely high. Following that I had ten increasingly great days of sobriety. ..Then the college I attend had a football game. I was cooking for people as well. Both activities I pretty strongly associate with drinking. I slipped and bought a bottle thinking I would handle it this time and naturally went head long into a bender. By Saturday night there is no telling what my BAC was but it was bad enough that I was too miserable Sunday to even try to drink. The shakes panic attacks and a horrendous stomach until at least 9-10 last night and I'm still a little shaky now. I had my medical followup this morning so hopefully my blood work will come back better this time... I apologize for the wall of text but it feels good to type it and if it deters one person from relapsing today of course it was worth it...Edit: I appreciate all the kind words from you folks. This place has been a great help here in early sobriety

Thank you for sharing and congrats on being honest with your doctor.  What a big step!  I'm just coming off a bad bender and your words will help me not drink today :)

Some times we have to go back for that last belly full of bad feed to let us know that this time is forever.  I hope for you and your livers sake that this is forever.  And never apologize for a wall of text your words are important so are you.  
I remembered how to stop drinking and how to get sober after a 7 year relapse when [I remembered that it begins with following directions these worked for me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)
Thanks for the post nice work... my thoughts are not to be too disheartened if your blood work is not much better this time as the liver may still be in recovery after the weekend bender. My last test was 23 days alcohol free and liver numbers were still sky high. Am planning on another 30days + before my next follow up test we shall see... Best of luck and please let us know how it goes.
