I have been sober for a year. [WOOP WOOP!](http://i.lvme.me/sgosfz5.jpg)..Hang on let me just type that out again...I have been sober for a year!! [Let us eat cake!](http://www-static.weddingbee.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/11/coyote1.png)..It has been an amazing enlightening challenging surprising and rewarding 365 days. My life now would be unrecognizable to the person I was over a year ago. I'm emotionally available to friends and family in ways I could never be when I was drinking. I'm so much more patient with myself. I'm more forgiving. Bad shit still happens and I struggle with my reactions and how I think and feel about them but every challenge is an opportunity to strengthen those muscles that got me that little smiley face in my star. Every single one of you who ever commented on a What's Up Wednesday post or posted about your challenges successes and milestones - you were all an integral part of getting me here. ..I spent a lot of time here on /stopdrinking with a lot of badge resets. My [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/11ud4l/how_do_you_use_rstopdrinking/) was almost three years ago. But I kept resetting my badge reading comments and posting. If you're new here or struggling please stick around. There's no doubt I owe my success to this group. ..The community we have here is so special and so important to so many people. I've been honored to serve as a moderator alongside the amazing /u/offtherocks /u/VictoriaElaine /u/JimBeamsHusband and /u/KetoJam. The amount of work they do behind the scenes every day is incredible. ..That said and after discussions with the other moderators I'm stepping down as a moderator of /stopdrinking. With everything else going on with me (new job! new relationship!) I'm not able to devote the time needed to the hard work of moderating. We're in great hands and I'm looking forward to having more time to spend reading your posts sharing your successes and offering help and support where I can. It's the least I can do for a group that gave me something more valuable to me than gold. ..[GROUP HUG!](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/2774416459/038c1496de1f1aa2e1d3a31b0ae60b74.jpeg)
