It's Friday night. I only slept a few hours last night. I was in work late last night and early this morning. Work has been really tough lately (I work in a psychiatric hospital) and I'm sooo drained...I saw a friend this afternoon and my boyfriend is coming over soon. We've had some pretty major problems lately made a million times worse by the things I've said and done whilst drunk. But this week things have slowly got more ok as I've tried to repair the damage I did last weekend after a massive drinking session...I am craving a drink badly today. I'm really scared of screwing up. I think being so tired and drained doesn't help. But I'm not going to drink. My relationship and my self-respect means more to me. I'm not going to drink today.

Bad days happen homie. You really don't need it. The more time you spend away from it the easier it gets. Not just cravings just life on the whole. You're stronger than you think!!

I was right there with you [the other day](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/38fjvy/having_a_hard_time_right_now/). Some good advice in the comments there.
