https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3jelmh/broken_pancreas/..https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3jvlow/broken_pancreas_update/..https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3lgxge/broken_pancreas_update_2/..Previous threads...I was asked by a few fellow SDers for an update so this is it...It has been about 2 months since I was released from the hospital and all is going very well.  The ascites has not come back and other than a few pancreatic attacks (I will call them) I have been fairly healthy.  The attacks though are incredibly painfull though with medication they are managable.  The biggest issue I have had is with my unbilical hernia (that you can see in the pictures on the previous post).  I really need to manage my fat intake because that causes the attacks that can last a few days. ...I am really unable to do anything that takes any strength from my stomach region.  That is lifting or crawling down to play with my son or such.  I cannot play with my son as I once could or pick him up and such until that gets fixed or else the hernia will 'flair up' and get tight and very painful.  It causes a great deal of discomfort but will eventually will work itself out and be better after an hour or two.  The doctors do not want to repair the hernia until it is known that the ascites will not return.  They said if an emergency a surgery would be done but to wait it out and deal with it if at all possible....I have gained back about 15lbs back but I am still very underweight.  Six feet tall and only 145lbs right not but I was only 130lbs not long ago.  The struggle to drink or not is still there but I have stayed sober.  I still think '1 more time' but then I think back to where I was and it straightens me out.  My wife still does not trust me and I cannot blame her.  I lied so many times in the past though it is getting better.  I am still finding bottles (some empty some with something in them) around the house as I do things.  I suppose I forgot in a drunken mind where they were before I passed out for the night....I will be going back into the hospital shortly to have my stent replaced and if all goes well in about 6 months the doctors will remove that stent and hope that the pancreas has healed so the ascites will not return.  It has been a hard road that I do not wish on anyone though modern medicine is quite marvelous.  I probably do not deserve it because it was all my doing but I am thankful none the less. ..Looking through my past posts I see many have reset their badges along the way and that is cool just work on it becasue it can happen to anyone...Take care all.
