Dax is the reason I even started thinking about quitting drinking. This video is something I needed to hear today. Thank you!
I just started listening to Armchair Expert not even knowing his history with addiction. It's SO GOOD.

Thanks so much.sigh..After 6 trips or more to the ER it never hit me. It took something else to wake me up too

This was a great watch it's always good to hear that celebs deal with the same stuff we do...money and fame is great I'm sure but it doesn't make certain things go away..Really should be grateful for what we're given and make the best of it..Thanks for posting
