I spent a year of relapses. I knew I couldn't moderate. ..I kept thinking I can't stop before Christmas Christmas Day is all about food and lots and lots of booze how will I get through New Years Eve?..But I stopped anyway. ..I used the Daily Checkin I kept my glass topped up with alternatives (Appletise in a champagne glass works wonders) I ate lots of ice cream and I read This Naked Mind...If I had waited till after I might have wasted many more months. As it is I'm ready for Christmas and New Year feeling happier and knowing I won't make a fool of myself in front of my family.

You are going to make it to that year u/fho390s! When I think about last Christmas I was in such inner turmoil at that time having hit my Rock Bottom just 3 months earlier. This year I don't have those problems. I did something about all that. I moved forward. I ate ice cream &amp; read a few books myself! I hope you have a great holiday season!
Woot woot ! You got this    
Two years ago I spent Halloween in a hotel room drunk by myself in Texas. Last year I spent the holidays in rehab. This year I've had to stay home or leave early from holiday celebrations but at least I was sober. Next year I'm sure it'll be better. It just takes time. Just make sure you have someone you can call and have an escape plan if you need to get out of a situation. You got this.
