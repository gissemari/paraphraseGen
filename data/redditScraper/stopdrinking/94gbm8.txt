AA is filled with recovering alcoholics full of wisdom.  I have bought into it more and more but they all say the same thing and a lot of it is quite from the Big Book.  I thought I'd share the only original thought I've come up with that an AA meeting seems to have bought into:..Alcoholism is like a lead balloon.  It takes a lot of pressure to make the balloon bigger but when it gets bigger there is no going back.  You can let the air out of it for 20 years but once you start blowing air back into it at first it seems innocent then the pressure builds and then it starts to get bigger again.  Eventually it pops.  It never gets smaller...I hope this metaphor helps someone.  I've always remembered that meeting and it helps me to avoid relapses.
