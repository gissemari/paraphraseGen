I had a rocky childhood. Sometimes I undermine how shitty it was sometimes I think it was shittier than it really was. However my parents both had their dance with the bottle my father being the main consumer in our family (alcohol dependent on the highest level). My mom is more of an abuser two years sober two years drunk kind of thing depressed and anxious as well.  Enough about them...I just want to share a little bit about how my mindset changed from being psychologically dependent on alcohol which triggered my anxiety and just making a habit out of drinking too often and too much.  Does it make sense that around two months ago I grew tired of it? I am going to therapy (an addiction prevention kind of therapy where I live they have that) and one day I came to therapy and told my therapist I have been drinking 5 days in a row. Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday and a couple of shots on a Monday. She asked me what I plan on doing about it and I said- just quit. In the beginning I was actually sincerely sad and scared I would not be able to even drink one time a week (or once a month) and I realized what negative way to think that was. There I was asking her if SHE thinks I will not be able to moderately drink and as soon as I asked this question I felt so clear and positive in my head I realized I dont want to drink. My anxiety while still there seems more clear and "normal" in a way it has a certain direction whereas when it was hangover anxiety it was just everywhere and everything triggered it. I used to go out of my way to ensure I can get drunk in the evening after work on a day off before a day off on a party- at home just everywhere I was just thinking about how many beers I have and if it will be enough. It never was with 3-4 cans so I would run to buy more before the alcohol selling was over. Without alcohol I have found love in my old hobbies again. ..I am more alive and have more energy I tackle problems in a more productive way and it is really sad that I just made myself feel worse by drinking it away. It never went away needless to say. That wonderful fake happiness that comes with a super hangover in the morning. My mind has tricked me numerous times and I just let it. When I tell people I am not drinking anymore (when offered) they say "not even one?" no not even one. Its the first one that always made me feel bad. If I feel anxiety free enough one day and feel like a want to drink a beer or two maybe I will sometimes. But I clearly doubt it and I am afraid I was just too deeply into it to ever go moderate. Just wanted to share my story and hopefully encourage someone struggling to try and stop drinking- and I would love to hear some other stories.

I'm so glad for you feeling better.  I never had anxiety until I realized to my shock and horror I had gone through like 20k savings in a few years.  I had quit looking at the balance.  Then massive anxiety hit.  I had to sell some assets.  That woke me up.  What the hell?  Anxiety is normal state of being for me if I am unprepared.  Duh!  Now I know why I was the worst public speaker with such HIGH ANXIETY I literally TREMBLED.  It was because I was not prepared and didn't practice.  Hello?  Sorry for the page of text.  I won't drink with you today.
