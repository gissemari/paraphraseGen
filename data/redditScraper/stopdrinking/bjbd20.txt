That's all it takes!  You got this.
Yeppers. The counting thing is helpful for some but not others.   IWNDWYT
The way I heard it is that every day is day one. That's the important part is that regardless of if you slip up one day or whatever each day you have a choice or the kind of person you want to be.
Me too. 1 1 1 .... is how it is done - for me at least. I don't know what tomorrow holds if anything.
Works for me! I will not drink today.
That's how I did it I avoided thinking about never drinking again and stuck to the manageable size of one day at a time thanks to this sub.
Right there with you. IWNDWYT
That's a great idea. Reading the comments is helpful too. Each day is a choice. I actually know I will drink again but not today and I am a better person today because of it.
Sounds like you have a winning battle plan.
I got frustrated with counting very early on and started thinking about TODAY. It's all you need. I did decide to have a badge. I don't believe in resets I've earned all those days. Some think differently and that's  OK too.
Exactly! IWNDWYT
Today is the day that matters most. Tomorrow will be here soon enough and you can deal with it when it is today. .(That sounds like something from an annoying inspirational post but I like it anyways)
I think that's the hardest concept for many people struggling to quit... the fact that you are quitting forever. Day to day is all we can do. My  advice try to find alternatives. If my cravings get too bad I drink tea. Kind of like chewing gum when you quit smoking.
One day at a time.  It's the quickest way we can do it.
