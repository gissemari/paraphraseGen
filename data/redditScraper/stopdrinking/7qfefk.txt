Hi all..Today is the end of my first two weeks sober. I'm so thrilled and grateful for how everyone supports each other in this group....Here's my progression:..* college: moderate beers while cooking almost always with people..* first year after - started drinking after work was a stressful year that included breaking up with live-in girlfriend by the end of it I more or less hated myself..* second year - worst by far - increased to 1.75 L of vodka every 2  days would be hard to think of when I didn't do this. "Kept it together" but gained weight face constantly in painful acne probably from constant stress from toxicity..* third year - slightly less but not much. 6-8 a night instead of 10-11 still every night..* fourth year - first time I started "scheduling" days off - down to 4 nights or so mostly every other day. Generally a six pack of DIPAs plus a 4loko when I wouldn't be drunk enough to pass out..* fifth year - scheduling more consistently more days "off" - 2-3 nights of heavy drinking a week a bottle of wine and large beer at the least......**throughout**: sneaking alcohol from friends and family (including my grandmother) trying to make it unnoticed by leaving some left in the bottle so many desperate walks to liquor stores in all parts of the world late at night or just before they closed hiding bottles in my closet and "rotating" stores so that they wouldn't notice. (right) ...**What changed**: even during the most "responsible" (last year) I had some of my biggest fuck-ups ever. This included going MIA and people thinking I was dead hitting on a friend and completely blacking out leading to the most throat-clenching shame I can remember because I couldn't even calibrate my shame to the right amount because I had no idea what happened mid-discussion throwing up multiple times and missing a plane. ....**Why I realized I needed a change**: even at my most regulated 2-3 days a week these past 4 months or so it's still unhealthy. It's not drinking to have fun - while that's part of it - but it's mostly drinking myself to oblivion. Even if I'm chilling at home enjoying some shows and eating snacks at the end of the night I'll go for a frigid walk to a liquor store for a half-pint of something to knock myself out. I've known that this went beyond other people's relationship with alcohol for a long time but I've never seriously attempted more than 5 days or so. I figured "why not just try it and see how it feels."...**So far**: It's easier than I thought it would be. I know plenty of people say *the sleep is great now* but I can't say the same because I've been so used to knocking myself out each night. Sleep aids have been pretty key even if I wake up drowsy - it takes away a motivator for drinking. ...I buy plenty of snacks and a ridiculous amount of seltzer. As in "how could anyone drink that much seltzer?" But really anything to treat myself and to reward every single day I don't drink is fine by me. Fitness is a good stand-in....I love waking up in the morning not being ashamed of anything. I love being able to hang out with my roommates and not passing out mid-movie. I love not spending hundreds of dollars each month on something that will vanish and leave me less healthy sadder and less productive than before. ...**Looking ahead**: My plan is to make it through a month and see how I feel. On one hand I could see wanting to drink socially and from time to time. But on the other the sheer amount of alcohol required to make me feel it is dangerous to my health and I've used it for so long to completely numb myself and knock myself out that I'm not sure moderation is in the cards for me. ...Right now I'm just fucking thrilled and I'm grateful for you all because it's the first time I saw people with similar thoughts and experiences struggling through the exact same things and bringing each other up along the way....Lots of love from this guy
