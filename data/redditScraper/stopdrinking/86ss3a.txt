I displayed my hand made jewelry at local art event yesterday evening. The venue was also having a free wine tasting about 10 feet away from my booth. The moment I spotted it my heart began to race. Not so much with desire but anxiety. I struggle in social situations and I'm the past had used alcohol as a buffer for my social anxiety. I had suffered a panic attack earlier in the day and was feeling pretty unstable tbh. .  One of the hosts came over and asked if I'd like to have some wine to   take the edge off   and Instead of giving in I took the offer as an opportunity to stand firm in my resolve to stay sober.   No thanks I'm good.  I told her. She gave me a puzzled look and asked if I was sure.   Yes I am sure thanks.  And she went on to the next person. .   I didn't bother explaining why I was declining a drink like I usually do. My explanation often comes out as more of an apology. I decided to push my comfort zone by just eliminating that part of the conversation. It felt really good to be that assertive. ..I'm nearly 50 days sober now and this subreddit has helped me so much to reach this point. I'm glad we can share our journeys and experiences with each other. Much love
