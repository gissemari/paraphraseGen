I am not comfortable talking about this with friends or family but I need to share. .. About 4 months ago I started having medical issues with my liver. Doctor explained to change my life or die  young . I have a sleeping disorder that causes hellish night-terrors when I enter and exit REM sleep. I have used alcohol to deny my body REM sleep because some shitty sleep is better than night-terrors. I was by no means an alcoholic but I was past drinking for enjoyment. ..Its been 9 nights of night-terrors. I feel like shit and constantly struggle to not turn to the bottle. I struggle  with admitting that  just one night  isn't a slippery slope. ..This is me saying that you aren't the only one struggling. so don't give up. One day at a time is all you need. If you can get through the day then you are better than who you were yesterday.

This is me saying "Wow I'm so damn proud of you!"  Thank you for sharing I have a family member with a similar condition and it is wild to be dealing with that and you're still sticking with your plan is super motivating.  Thank you for sharing you never know who's gonna be reading and it may help.  I won't make any suggestions as I'm sure you've tried em all but thank you again for sharing I'm pulling for you like crazy and I will not drink with you today.
Wow...that's tough. Do you have the same sleep disorder as comedian [Mike Berbiglia](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/361/fear-of-sleep)? I think he has to zip himself up in a sleeping bag and wear oven mits so he doesn't hurt himself.
One day at a time very true..Your not alone we all struggle but being a drunk and hungover sucks..IWNDWYT or tomorrow.
