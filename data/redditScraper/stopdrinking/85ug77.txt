Hello SD well this might be difficult to understand but I'm going to try and explain this...First things first I have relapsed..again..i did my usual party trick and didn't even last one day...I'm back here to reset my badge and start afresh. ..Now..normally when i relapse I'm full of self loathing and left wondering if i can ever stop but not this time..i feel like something has switched on in my head i cannot describe it..i am feeling more determination to stop than i ever have before and I'm actually starting to believe I can..small steps at a time of course..i know it won't happen overnight and it won't be easy but I'm ready to smash this...Sorry if that was a bit random I just wanted to share...I will not drink with you today.

Let's do this together! We're both on day 1 again.
And I wont drink with you today...When I stopped I woke up determined and that feeling never relented. There were so many false starts and then one day I was determined.
I had tried many times before also but now on 14 days and so glad I decided to stop.  Feel so much better for doing so!  You can do this we are all here with you in this struggle.  Keep on going and I will not drink with you today :)
It's all about changing your mindset. Just avoid that first drink for the 24 hours. You can do it. 
No time better than right now to give this a shot.
I had a hard switch one time too. You got this!
