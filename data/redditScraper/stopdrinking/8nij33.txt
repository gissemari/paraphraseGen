I relapsed this past weekend and had a front row see to the madness of my addiction and how quickly I could crash and burn.  It turned into a hellish weekend of depression and bad decisions...The evidence continues to show that the consequences get worse every time.  I'm back in my meetings and restarting my journey.  I want to say thanks to all of you for your support and this wonderful forum.  I know that I can do this.  Just one day at a time.
