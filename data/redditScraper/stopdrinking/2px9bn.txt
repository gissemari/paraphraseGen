I'm about to make a nerve-wracking phone call. I am injured and therefore unable to perform my normal job duties. I took some time off a month ago and thought I was better enough to come back but I was wrong and now I am in the same place again with the pain. So I'm about to call my manager and request 2-3 weeks off of work to allow myself to heal fully. ..In the back of my head there's a nagging voice telling me that I don't deserve time off that I have to go to work *no matter what* (This is the same voice that guilted me into working through excruciating hangovers regularly.) I was at the point where I felt such despair that I started giving thought to relapsing; because in my crazy twisted mind that somehow matched my external circumstances to my feelings better. (screwy I know) ..But no I'lll take some time off of work.  While my body is healing I'll use my mind to figure out the next right steps in line with my career aspirations. I didn't get a degree to spend my life bartending. ..I will not drink.

r_and_p why don't you ask your physician to formally take you off work?  Under US law you may be entitled as a matter of law to the time off that you're requesting. 
It's so heartwarming to hear you are doing the right thing for you. Also it makes me really happy to read the support in the comments. 
Hi. It's good to hear from you although I'm sorry to hear about your health problems. Take care and have a sober holiday.
