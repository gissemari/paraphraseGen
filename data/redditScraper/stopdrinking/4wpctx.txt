I think those early days are hard the hardest. And it's easy to let your guard down 2 3 4 weeks in. The temptations slow down as time progresses so stick with it. You should feel really good about yourself each morning you wake up without a hang over. That should also give you a sense of empowerment knowing you can push though the temptations. Stick with it. We all know it's with it! All the best. 
i would only say to plan for the triggers that made you drink this time. that situation will come back again and your plan needs to be in place if you want to stay sober for longer. In my attempts at sobriety i went 3 weeks without drinking and i thought i have it in control. that led me to drink once in 2 weeks then once a week to few days a week. so i saw the drinking trend is coming back again. I introspected reasons and I planned actions which have helped so far.
It sucks when it happens but the big thing is don't make a big deal about it. Everyday is a new day and a new chance to stay sober. ..Celebrate your successes and learn from your mistakes. Find your interrupts that help when you feel like you are falling off the wagon. A thought or something that makes you stop reaching for the bottle and do something else...You've set yourself a good target now beat it...
