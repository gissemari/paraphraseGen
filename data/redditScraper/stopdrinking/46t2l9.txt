For every reason and for every excuse that alcohol will put into your brain I have stumbled in my early recovery...For me I was doing pretty good but had some stop and go. But about a week ago I settled a very large lawsuit and the opposing counsel sent me a case of very fine wine. Like the kind that costs $100 a bottle. I should've given the wine away...but I was like "I've been doing so great lately with sobriety I can enjoy these in the evenings!...**I don't think I'd drink $1200 wine in one sitting!"**..This was the Thursday before Presidents' Day weekend.... And **I basically drank $1200 of wine in one sitting** (well...over the course of the next few days). When done I moved on to vodka to the point that I have almost no recollection of anything that occurred the entire weekend of President's weekend. Apparently my husband and I went out to dinner a few times and a movie. I remember very little of this. I continued drinking in the evenings until this last Wednesday.  ..On Thursday after getting through an out of town court  appearance I had to drive back to the office for my yearly review. I was so hung over and tired I could barely drive. I had to pull my car over to a deserted dead end street crawl into the backseat of my car and take a nap. I've never felt so shitty and I didn't even really sleep due to my heart rate and my general feeling of crapiness...I got back to my office and my boss gave me one of the most glowing reviews I've ever had. This is because I've always been able to get my work done and I honestly worked very hard at my job. But it was obvious to me that it was more of a struggle every day to perform at my peak. And I was able to hide a lot of my problems because I work from home and as long as I log in my hours I could sleep in. But I felt so guilty knowing that I can do so much better knowing that next year if this continued my awesome boss would have no choice but to fire me...I took Friday off mainly because I still felt so shitty but also to detox (more time lost when I could be contributing to my job!) I spent the entire day in bed with the shakes insomnia and nausea. A great reminder that this shit is just not worth it...I know that when I'm not drinking I am so much less stressed because I can actually get work done handle difficult problems and that my anxiety is reduced because of this. Today I continue to have insomnia and the feeling of lethargy but I'm looking forward to Monday when I can go back to work with a clearer head. ..This is already too long so I'm not going into the reasons why I went back to drinking (it's all the typical drunk-thinking excuses). But this made me realize I need to take my sobriety more serious. I am working on better plans to prepare for inevitable encounters alcohol in the future...And I realized that I need to be on this subReddit more often. **Because any day you didn't see me on here either in a comment a submission or on the daily check in I can pretty much guarantee you it was a day that I was drinking.** So I realized how important this community is to me it's the only support group I have besides my husband and I'm starting to realize it's one of the most important tools that keeps me sober. Thank you all; keep posting your stories because I'm reading them...**TL;DR:** typical newbie stumbling through sobriety starting to figure things out...this subreddit is awesome. ./edit: formatting.

Glad to have you back.  I have always taken care of business whether it be work family exercise etc.  when drinking heavily on the weekends and evenings after work.  It was taking its toll though.  I started noticing mental instability reaching new heights. Depression anxiety insecurity.  It was getting ready to destroy me.  I am lucky 20 years of heavy Canadian Club use did not cause a major life crash.  I am tired of rolling the dice.  I will not drink with you tonight.  I will continue to take care of business so much easier without that shit.
I too did the pulling over on a dead end street to take a nap on the backseat thing except that I was buzzed not hungover. Much worse! This community is also very important to me. Glad you are back.
Great post.  This could be something you put in your journal carry in a wallet something handy to be pulled out and reviewed at the first instance of an urge.  "Play the tape forward."  A reminder of what happens when your mind whispers "You deserve it.  You Earned it.  Cmon just One Littul Drinkey-Poo".  ..Tell the little voice "been there done that; No Thank You!"..
Welcome back aboard. Just imagine what you can achieve now! Mental ninja 
I totally relate to the high functioning at work (I am a lawyer too) but then drinking wine at night as a "reward" to "relax" (for me to pass out/sleep and then drag myself into work late). I've managed 52 days and whenever I start to go down the rationalizing road I sign on here. It is my only support group for now and it is working for me. I admit I still miss the habit trigger that a glass (ok a bottle) of wine was for me in the evening to mark the end of a long day. Trying to find new habits to replace those but it is taking awhile. Meanwhile I will keep coming back here.
