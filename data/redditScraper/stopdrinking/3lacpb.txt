It hasn't been easy giving up alcohol. I've had some fairly severe mood swings. I've also been so exhausted I couldn't do anything but go to bed at 5pm. My appetite has ranged from 'GET IN MY FUCKING MOUTH' to 'Urgh food'. I've been thirstier than any hangover has ever made me. I've cried. A lot. Like A LOT. I've shouted. I've sulked. I've held numerous pity parties for myself. ..But.....I've laughed a lot and known it was genuine and heartfelt laughter. I've discovered compassion and selflessness - I'm nicer to others even if it takes a bit of deep breathing. I'm fitter and actually enjoy working out. I've lost 20lbs. I sleep well. I'm hydrated. I take care of myself better. There seem to be more hours in the day for me to do the things I need to AND the things I enjoy. I'm a better parent and wife. I've saved roughly  500 in 29 days. ..To those struggling - it gets better. I still have shitty days where I want to hide away and ignore everyone. However I don't blow it up out of all proportion. I talk about it I work through it and I treat myself with kindness. I'm no saint - I have so much I need to work on - but during those increasing moments of clarity I can honestly say that being sober is better than I ever imagined it could be. .Stay strong - and just for today lets not drink.
