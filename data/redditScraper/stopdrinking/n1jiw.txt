I was sent here from VictoriaElaine's post in TwoXChromosomes. Congrats to her by the way. This post is going to talk about a lot of things not really exclusive to my drinking but possibilities of why I am predisposed to use substances so much as well. I do not know if such a detailed life post is allowed here but I am going to go for it anyway. ..**Substance Background**..I have used substances of some sort since I was twelve. It started when I was prescribed xanax and it blew my mind so I started to use it incorrectly. I dabbled in cocaine prescription pills weed etc. However for the most part I had things under control until I was eighteen. I grew up in Florida where oxycontin is everywhere. By the time I was 22 I was sleeping with people to attain it I became homeless I was very broken. After about five months of being in a limbo stage of abstaining and occasionally relapsing I finally stopped using it. I moved to a different state to live with a guy I met on the internet in order to get away from everything. He was a recovered alcoholic. However we were in a car accident and he lost his ability to walk (he is still slowly regaining it and it's been almost a year now). After the accident we started drinking which I feel terrible for because I knew of his problems in the past and I feel I should have said something but in all honesty I was being ridiculously selfish because sobriety was starting to drive me crazy. I started off in late January of this year drinking a bottle of wine every night. Then I progressed up to where I am at now which is drinking a fifth of whiskey every night. I also have ulcers and the drinking is making them worst - I poop blood everyday. ..**Mental Health History**..I was court ordered to attend therapy until I was eighteen since I was eight. When I was 13 I was officially diagnosed with depression anxiety PTSD and insomnia. I also believe I have depersonalization disorder but it is just self-diagnosed so I could be wrong. Once I was eighteen I was so relieved to quit going because I always so it as an annoying nuisance. I moved around family member to family member a lot so I always had different therapists and it was just a pain in general to work around. When I was 21 I started going to the school therapist. I was going to start therapy after I moved but then the car accident happened leaving me without transportation. I live in a rural area so it is pretty much impossible for me to seek one out at the moment...**General Life Issues** ..I was sexually abused by my father when I was young. This is actually the reason why I had to go to therapy until I was eighteen. He was also extremely abusive to my mother and she in turn was physically and mentally abusive to my sister and I. When it came out that my dad was sexually abusing me my mom divorced him and we took him to court (which I am grateful for some people are not so lucky). However it tore my family up - extended relatives started chipping in their two cents that basically she shouldn't have left him my grandparents on my dad's side stopped talking to me (and even gave him a crapload of money so he could get a good lawyer). It was incredibly stressful for me and if you combine that with an eight year old who is constantly being questioned by lawyers social workers therapists etc I honestly wanted to just drop the whole thing. It felt like people were accusing me of lying and/or trying to place blame on me. My mom wouldn't let me though (and for that I am also grateful). However since she was abusive to me and my sister our relationship was very rocky. After my dad was out of the picture though she chilled out a lot EXCEPT she started drinking. And when she drank she could become just as mean but mostly she just became negligent. My sister and I started staying with family members or friends for the most part. When I was 14 and she was 11 we decided that we had to split up. Unfortunately people were more likely to help take one person in then the both of us. We figured it evened out our odds of living somewhat nicer and stable lives. However stability never really existed for me. ..When I got to university at eighteen I started dating this guy who was abusive. I stayed with him until I was 22. It did make me realize that I am incredibly codependent. I realized that since I was sixteen (I am 23 now) I have only been single for about a combined three months. I crave love and stability - even if it is just a fake sense of it. ..I **do not** want to use my past as an excuse for my behavior. It's just I've been floating through life mostly thinking that I knew everything (when I was a teenager) or being in denial (my early 20s up until this point). This is the first time I have really REALLY examined my past and realized just how fucked up it was and how much it has completely skewed how I look at life. There is actually even more stuff I could have wrote about/expanded upon what I wrote but I believe these are the biggest things. I think I am going to have to fix issues I have that stem from events in my life before I can be fully healthy and not be at an extreme risk for a relapse. I just have no idea what I am doing. ..EDIT: Wow thank you everyone. I got a lot more responses than I imagined.

Glad you stopped in! Are you able to see a mental health professional about the problems you listed above? If you can meet a few and find one you like particularly one who has experience in abuse and substance abuse. Managing those anxieties will definitely help with your drinking...I started doing drugs young and it was when I got older I started drinking more. Since I was 16 I had to get messed up everyday no matter what. I convinced myself it helped my problems my depression anxiety and loneliness but it was counteractive. I wasn't happier I was just fatter and more sad. I wasnt more relaxed I was nervous and full of self doubt and It certainly didn't help my relationships. My drinking caused more turmoil in my love life to a point where I have had no romantic involvement with someone in almost a year. ..Try to make a list of the problems alcohol causes or exacerbates keep it with you. When you want to go to the liquor store open it up. That helps keep my mind in check. ..There are many others here with more experience and from situations similar to yours but that is how I approach it now. One day at a time. ..Keep coming back!

Welcome it's so great to have you here! ..I really connected with your story. It's got a lot of pain and hurt in there. I was diagnosed with all sorts of mental disorders in my 20's but a lot of them have almost cleared up when I quit drinking. Pretty astounding how alcohol has such a huge influence on my mental world...Your past does not excuse your behaviour now but it definitely gives me an idea of what you've been through. And through all of this I see a very capable person...| I think I am going to have to fix issues I have that stem from events in my life before I can be fully healthy and not be at an extreme risk for a relapse. I just have no idea what I am doing...A lot of these issues don't require fixing. There is nothing you can do about your past. Acceptance might be more what you're looking for. ..It's okay to have no idea what to do. I had NO FUCKING CLUE what I was doing when I went to treatment. Like I just got there with my bags and went "Ok....uhm....TEACH ME??" I didn't know any recovery "lingo" and had never tried to quit alcohol before so I was terrified...Last thing I wanted to say is: don't be thinking about relapse right now. It's just not the right time to be worried about that. Right now. Right here. Today. Today!!! That is all we have. This moment. Right now. This is what we can work with...*Deep breath* You can do this.

Welcome and thank you for posting...If you want to stay sober there is hope. There is a fair amount of long term sobriety on this subreddit and a lot of good people...Getting sober may not solve all of your problems but it may make dealing with other issues a little easier. If you want to stay sober make a decision today to stay sober today no matter what. If you want a drink tell yourself 'tomorrow not today'. Stay sober taking it one day at a time. Make that commitment a conscious decision each and every day. You **CAN** do it. Others here have. So can you...Some here have found AA to be useful in getting sober and staying sober. AA cannot solve all of your problems but it can help solve your drinking problem. If you choose to go you may also find others who share some of your other problems. Just knowing that you are not alone can make a difference.
Hi and welcome.  Glad you're here...Like Victoria said:  although your history is no doubt a source of great pain to you in the end it doesn't matter why you drink.  The only significant factor is that you drink.  You can spend the rest of your life pinpointing what incident caused what behavior and never get to the end of it.  ..Judging by your post I would like to suggest that you need medical attention and probably a medically assisted detox.  Please seek help immediately.  I will be thinking about you tonight.  I wish you the very best.
Welcome!..I never thought I'd be sober. Ever. I drank like a finely tuned drinking machine. Yet here I am. You can do this.
Hi Summer. I have been wondering if I had anything useful to add to this conversation. Sometimes if someone's background is different than mine I worry that my thoughts might not be helpful or may seem insensitive. There is a lot to parse in your story. I just want to say that I am listening and am glad you are here. ..Making the decision to stop drinking is the right choice. No matter what life is better without drinking for those of us that are alcoholics. There are a few things that I usually recommend to anyone who comes to believe that they cannot control their drinking and have made a choice to stop.  These are a few of those things that have been working for me:..* Making the decision not to drink one day at a time. Solemn vows of "NEVER AGAIN" don't seem to work for me. I make the decision not to drink each day. ..* Taking it easy on myself. Practicing forgiveness with myself. I tend to have an all or noting attitude toward life. Either I am going to win the Nobel Prize and become the most loved person on earth or I am going to do nothing jump into the void and drink myself to death. I need to learn to give myself credit where it is due and try and let myself be  a little ordinary. I also try to recognize where I need work and take APPROPRIATE action to make things better.. .* Telling the people that matter that I am an alcoholic. There is a tremendous amount of power in that statement for myself and the people in my life. ..* Keeping it simple. I seem to think that I need to have some type of profound experience to change. What I really need to do is be regular in my habits eat right and adequately and focus on the small stuff in life. ..I really wish you the best. I hope you hang out here and contribute. I think you offer a unique perspective and experience that would be tremendously helpful to many many people. Thank you for posting!
