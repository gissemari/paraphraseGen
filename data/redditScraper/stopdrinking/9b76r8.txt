I found this really interesting article on dry drunk/PAWS symptoms. I could not figure out why certain people hadn't noticed a marked change in my behaviours and commenting that I was just as bad as I was previously in some respects. I searched for answers after I just recently overreacted at my wife and slew a whole host of things about her that were half true and as excuse for my initial spiral into alcohol abuse. Upon reading it does seem as if I think I'm far further ahead in my recovery than I think I am and although I have started psychology appointments and have started depression medication I still have much to deal with mentally before I am well....I hope this may help someone out there struggling with similar issues. ..http://www.thomkesslertherapist.com/blog/untreated-alcoholism-or-the-dry-drunk-syndrome

Taking the alcohol out of the alcoholic doesn't solve the problem for me either. When i go to meetings I am happy joyous and free. When i don't go to meetings I still don't drink but I am a nightmare to be around. Like a caged animal. Worst of all I won't admit it!  But once I go to a meeting and get honest I know it's the truth. ..Great post OP and thanks for the reminder about dry drunk syndrome. 
For me removing the alcohol from my life was like sloughing off chains i had bound myself in. That made it easier to tread water not sink deeper and stay alive. Next came remembering how to swim and get to dry land.  Now i've caught my breath and am out of immediate danger but i need to remember how to make my way in the world... this journey is by no means over!
