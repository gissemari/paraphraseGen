Hello throwaway I made some time ago but never actually posted because I thought I was handling things better...I've been struggling with anxiety and depression for quite some time. The depression was never really something I considered because I guess I didn't know what normal was supposed to feel like I still dont. Anyway I had been up and down for months I've had a few instances of having anxiety and drinking and then drinking because I couldn't deal with the anxiety. I moved in with my gf and things were better for me. I had a couple of instances of drinking to cope with anxiety and was hiding it from my gf. I guess because I was ashamed and confused. I went to the doctor I went to counseling and things started to seem to get better again. I looked back on those times of hiding it and felt immense shame and guilt and never wanted to be there again. I never told her and I truly believed I would never do it again...I've had more instances of controlled drinking being successful in the past few months than not. I've never considered myself someone who craved alcohol I used it in the past to deal with something I didn't understand but I looked back on that and thought I was getting better...I wasn't. After a weekend of drinking with my girlfriend my anxiety hit me again at the end of it. I pushed through it until I got home and went and bought some hard liquor and hid it. I missed work and every day lied to my girlfriend that I was just anxious but never about the drinking. Shit hit the fan when she asked me what happened to some alcohol we had at the place and I lied about not drinking it. After some time she asked again and I said I drank it. She said she would be calling my parents and they would be picking me up and that our relationship was over. She lost all trust knows this wasn't the first time and is probably just assuming that I've been nonstop hiding it from her and everyone else. Which isn't entirely true like I said I was up and down and had hid it in the past but it was maybe a few times. 1 time is too many though...Now this wasn't a small relationship this was a relationship for a long time that we both thought we were it for each other. I'm happy she called my parents and I understand why she's upset. She packed all of my things and I picked them up I am now living at home and have scheduled appointments to get help. I still can't shake the anxiety and the guilt but I'm not craving alcohol I'm just craving genuine happiness and everything to be back to normal...I guess I just can't come to terms that something that seemed so solid and so definite in my life is over. I still think I can fix it but I'm afraid she won't want to. She told me we would never be together again that she could never trust me again. I know I need to focus on myself and getting the help I need but this loss seems like the most important thing that's ever happened to me. It's still only been a few days since this happened and we haven't been in contact. I've struggled every second since it happened. I wish I could have her there to support me it would make it so much easier but I can't change what I did.

it's a good thing that you think about it now. maybe you can talk the things out with your SO and maybe she will understand your situation.... I would try that in your situation....
I'm so sorry for your situation. ..The important thing now is not to allow the stress from your relationship cause you to drink again..Because that is a huge possibility..It may take time to rekindle the relationship and win back the trust of a loved one. But if you drink now you're demolishing that possibility by saying  I won't change. I will drink when I don't feel good and there's nothing you can do about it ...Give time for the wounds to heal don't pour salt on them by drinking...IWNDWYT .
