I seem to go for a few days or a week then just lose it all over again. Not just like a few drinks but getting absolutely hammered. I don't remember last night I have a black eye and I'm full of regret. I really don't want to go to rehab. Please advice anyone

Sounds like you need more support. Rehab was one of my best decisions. This merry-go-round you are on is deadly.
Have you tried AA? It worked for me today and I always fall on Friday.
In the beginning I went to a lot of meetings I hung around sober people - not alone. I did whatever it took.  AA Smart whatever try one try em all.
I had to get support to stop.  Surrender was not my giving up.  Surrender was me accepting that others can and will help me if I let them...That's all I needed!
There's very few people who can break addiction on their own thru willpower alone. One constant i see in longterm successful recovery is help outside the self. This can be rehab personal therapy recovery meetings or some combination. I know I used a personal therapist and am active here in SD daily sharing and commiserating. I feel very successful so far.              ..My personal belief to why this is is number one: support. Number two: challenging the self and preconceived notions. Being able to relate to others thru their help or experience or flipping the situation and helping them. It's esteemable action that provides positive feedback to beat back the darkness of addiction and helped me to rewire my brain logically while it was still wired physically for dependency. Gave me (and I believe others) that little extra resolve to continue the fight when everything is screaming give in. Eventually thru action the mind and body follow and heal.       ..You can do this. Hang in there.
