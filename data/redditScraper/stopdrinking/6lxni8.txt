I don't know where to start but I've been struggling with alcohol for a while. I'm sober now but last night I got drunk and my SO found out after telling me if I hide it again it would be over. She isn't leaving but I'm taking the first step to getting better. I want to be a part of this community and I want to stop drinking.

Get to a meeting
Good luck and thanks for posting...Some things that have helped some people are taking it day-by-day or even moment-to-moment trying every flavor of sparkling water known to man taking up obscure and involved hobbies connecting with people in person or online exercising basically anything to get you through the rough times and focusing on the positives.
Get the app called sobertime and start a counter to hold yourself accountable. Listen the the audiobook "the naked mind." 
Welcome. Lots to learn here and lots of support...Congrats on day 1!
Hi! Welcome! I have found that every day away from drinking is a better one. I wish you well and remember you are not alone in this struggle. We're all here together cheering you on. I will not drink with you today.
Do it for yourself not for her. 
Thanks for the responses. I haven't fully read them all because I'm closing at work but will get back to you all tonight
You have a whole sober community rooting for you. Sometimes its day by day others its minute by minute. A new way of life is possible one day at a time. I could never imagine the obsession being lifted but today my life isn't ruled by getting drunk and loaded. Now I get to give back and try to help others go through the same process. That's what its all about
