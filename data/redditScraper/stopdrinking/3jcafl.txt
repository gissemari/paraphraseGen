Hey guys!! Hey guys!! Happy Wednesday! It's time to [GET UP AND DANCE!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxAn4Tx96ZA)..Let's hump it out on this happy day! Hump days are when we calibrate our sobriety check in see how our /sd buds are doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations in the format below...**Triumph**: 401 day of sobriety feels good man! My life is filled with lots of little triumphs each day. When I was drinking I could do *one hard thing* a day. I could engage with my family or I could work hard on a project at work or I could visit with a friend or I could tidy my house. Each was a challenge I dreaded. Yesterday I did all of those things as a part of a "normal" day. Looking back it's amazing and awesome. ..**Struggle**: I honestly thought that 400 days sober would mean that I knew what was going on with me. I'm realizing that my drinking masked all kinds of internal thoughts and assumptions that I'm only starting to unpack now. I'm in therapy which can be a pain in the ass sometimes but I'm realizing it's still so vitally important for me to demarcate a time each week where I sit down and focus on what's going on with me. I'm unpacking some heavy stuff and it's frightening to realize I didn't even know it was there 402 days ago (or even 200 days ago). I'm getting to where I need/want to be hopefully...**General Chat**: Fall. Is it fall yet? FALL!! Are there fall-type activities you're looking forward to in sobriety? I've never done the pumpkin/apple picking thing - am definitely going to do it this year. You?..More important how are you guys doing? How has this week been for you? Let us know your triumphs and struggles!

[Hump DAaAAaaaAAaaaaAY!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q24kL2Qae1U)
Struggle: I keep making it 2-3 weeks functioning in a way I would call clean and normal but always relapse really badly. I know Im hurting the people around me and while I know I need to accept the blame I just wish there was a way of telling them I could never intentionally hurt them..Watching my girlfriend recoil from my hand while I was drunk was a powerful moment...Triumph: I realized that my usual strategy of staying busy isnt working as soon as I have a day off from work the demons sink their claws in and I relapse. I know and accept this so this time Im trying to be honest with myself and grow as a person into someone who doesnt need alcohol not someone who runs from it...
Triumph: two days in a row where I had no real plans yet stayed sober. Normally that would mean I would be hung over like mad right now having drank the days away to deal with sadness and boredom but not this time!..Struggle: I'm withdrawing. I can't sleep at all. I keep sweating and feel cold. I have no motivation to do work or go to work or even leave my bed. I am so tired.....General Chat: what's for lunch today? I am about to cook beef and broccoli for myself :)
Yes .. yesterday was a struggle ... I wanted something and I knew it wasn't a beer .. tho it crossed my mind .. I settled on a cola and didn't look back ... I'm just not ready to give up what I have right now for what awaits me if I start again ........ stay strong everyone and stay sober!!! thanks
**Triumph:** I set myself a goal to ride my bike 1000 km this summer which I hit by the end of July so I upped it to 2000 km. As of this morning I've done 1996 km. If I had realized I was so close I would have rode around the block a few more times :) but I will hit my goal on my Friday ride and it feels pretty good...**Struggle:** The seasons changing always gets me a little depressed. I'm not a fan of winter and it always gets me down. I need to learn to embrace it and enjoy it more... but I say that to myself every year...**General Chat:** I love hiking or riding my bike anywhere I can see the fall colours. I think I'd enjoy fall even more if it didn't mean winter was around the corner.
**T**: Despite running late I went to my first ACOA meeting.  It was better than I thought and I'll go to another. Work is super stressful but I'm not tempted to drink so YAY! My addiction to La Croix however is increasing exponentially. So grateful for sobriety!..**S**: No booze means stress is hitting me hard and I'm on the edge of getting sick. I'm working hard to not internalize it. Thank god for gardening and running...**C**: Ooh apple picking I am totally going to look into that! I love cooking and some apple sauce from fresh-picked apples sounds yummo. It's still pretty hot here but morning and evening are getting cooler. 
Triumph: I have gained the clarity and productiveness to begin opening a new shop and allowing my business to grow. .I now find great pleasure in the little things like watching something all comfy and relaxed in bed drinking water with ice (icy cold water is amazing!) and going for a midnight drive for no other reason than to drive...Struggle: Feeling all my emotions again and not knowing how to deal with them. ..General Chat: I'm happy to see the last of summer winter has always been my favourite time of year and I'm looking forward to enjoying Christmas in a new way.
24 hours down the hatch!.
Triumph: I received a promotion at work! It is new and exciting and I've put 11 years into this industry to be where I am now. I'm so grateful because if I wasn't sober it wouldn't have happened. Also I've set up payment plans to pay off old medical debts and within a year I can be 100% debt free!..Struggle: There is a lot of jealousy over my new position and a lot of people are very upset that I moved up in our company. It is incredibly stressful and it honestly hurts my feelings that so many of them have sent rude emails and messages and have been talking about me behind my back :( ..General chat:  the sun is shining the weather is beautiful and football season is upon us. Woohoo!!! :) :)
**Triumph:** I'm proud of myself for recognizing straight away that having thoughts about drinking means that I need to be more proactive in my recovery and taking action before it could get out of hand. ..**Struggle:** I've started taking steroids (not the kind that make you muscled the kind that make you fat) and I'm having crazy sugar cravings. Like crazy out of hand "I could eat a whole cake in one sitting" cravings. I don't usually have a massive sweet tooth and even when I was first sober it was never this bad. I am sorta just rolling with it for the moment and eating way more sweet stuff than I should but I'm going to be on this medication for a while so long term I gotta figure out a better plan...**General Chat:** It feels like fall. I like the U-Pick apple places it isn't cheaper than getting them at the grocery store but they taste better and it's sorta fun. This fall I'm going to put more spring-blooming bulbs in our tiny front garden. I planted some a few years ago but I totally underestimated how many I would need. More is more when it comes to bulbs I guess. 
**Triumph:** I turned yesterday's short run into a very long one (for me). In the last hour I realized that adding a few miles wasn't going to add  any more hurt to what I already felt. Huge shout out to r/SDrunners and the folks last year who suggested running as a healthy outlet for my anger...**Struggle:** I'm procrastinating on some work projects I don't want to address. My wife has another 3 weeks of ~~insane~~irrational stress about major projects. It's all spilling over into non-work life...**Chat:** FALL!!! means winter is around the corner. I'm going to savor every beautiful day between now and the gray season.
**Triumph**: My wife and I just got back from an amazing vacation last week.  We hit the beach.  We hit the pool.  We hit the courts.  We hit some nice restaurants.  And they all went down for the count because we vacationed the SHIT out of them. ;-)  (OK... I'll settle down)...There were two HUGE incidents that happened on vacation that required a cool head and me having my wits about me.  Being sober helped me step up and be a real "superman" for my wife.  It felt good to handle the situations well and come out looking like a hero...**Struggle**: I'm having the post-vacation blues.  It sucks coming back to normal life after not being shackled by email and work for just over a week.  Boo-hoo!..**General Chat**: Fall?  Why are people so anxious to get rid of summer?  Summer is awesome and I want to squeeze out as many 80F nights as I can before it starts getting dark by 5 PM!
**Triumph**: I'm slowly becoming more and more productive. When I was drinking I used that as a tool to basically not function (the reasoning basically being "there's no reason not to since I'd just be a lazy screwup anyway"). For maybe the first 40 days without drinking I kept the same habits but it bugged me more the more I did it. Now I'm doing things that are probably not much to be proud of (though I'm crazy proud of myself for using my swamp cooler to keep my laptop from crashing while playing games on it). But at least I'm doing them...**Struggle**: I've said many times that the reason I was finally ready to quit drinking is that what I learned through the intensive therapy I finished about 18 months ago finally replaced my default thinking. But now the things I never quite worked through all the way because of the drinking are cropping back up and I need to deal with them. Fortunately it's not triggering any urge to drink (which I'm very surprised at). But having spent my entire life forcing myself to not feel emotions it's difficult and very scary...**General Chat**: I think I'm going to try checking out all kinds of different apple ciders and fall things like that. One of my favorite things since I've stopped drinking alcohol is that I have lots of opportunities to try other delicious stuff (and I remember being all about the apple cider when I was younger). It's weird I remember so many times being at restaurants and ordering whatever had a high alcohol content and being bummed that I "couldn't" have something else that looked good but was nonalcoholic. 
**Triumph:** Last Friday I had a bad day at work but was really excited and energetic once I got out and it was a beautiful day.  Not too long ago that specific set of circumstances would have been the exact recipe for a real bender.  I would have started drinking strong and fast as soon as I got home and either been in a stupor by 8 pm (when I agreed to meet a friend for dinner) or (much worse) just showed up and been a mess (as happened in September 2013; one of my most shameful moments).  Not only did I not drink but I was really excited to watch the situation unfold and have the self-awareness to finally realize the triggers that caused those benders in the first place.  ..**Struggle:**  I still think about throwing away my two months without drinking but those thoughts are fleeting.  More of a challenge is stopping eating so much ice cream to replace all the sugar I used to get from alcohol.  ..**Chat:** You never know what's going to really stick with you that you read here.  On Monday night I went to bed after reading a post (apparently deleted) by someone who had maybe 2 or 3 months without drinking but then went out and got a DUI on their first time back.  I couldn't stop thinking about that post.  How it's important to move towards the positives of not drinking (better skin and no hangovers for example) but that there's also something OK about being "scared straight" from time to time.  On the night I stopped drinking (July 3rd) I woke from a stupor thinking "This time's nine."  Meaning I've (metaphorically) used up 8 of my 9 lives without serious consequences but if I keep drinking there's bound to be something harsh coming down the pike.  I really want to thank the person that posted their consequences and made me reflect on all this.  I can easily see that happening to me and the worst part would be that I would think that I somehow "earned" the right to mess up a little without consequences because I've gone 60 days without drinking.  But "consequences" aren't karma and don't care if you've been sober for a month or a year or not at all; when they come they come.  I'm grateful that I won't be drinking today.
**Triumph:** 70 days without a drink.  Never thought I'd be at this point.  Never thought I'd need to.  Long since bypassed the longest of not having a drink over two months ago...**Struggle:** I was a binge drinker.  Once I start I can't stop.  When I started this I didn't have an end goal.  I just didn't want to fuck up again.  Eventually I reached a soft goal of wanting 6 months and then see what I thought.  I'm struggling with the thought of never drinking again.  I liked it when I did it responsibly.  But every few months or so I'd slip up.  I can't slip up again.  For me and my family.  Not sure where the path will take me but I'm on my way there...**General Chat:**  I've recently made another shot at meditation.  Just a couple days in of actually trying.  But I've been reading different things that meditation can help me with and I'm super excited about the prospects. Oh and this might be my first post here too so hi.
**Triumph:**Going on three days of no depression and high production today. yay for good days...**Struggle:** There's a moral dilemma at work.  Do I stick to my ethics hard-headedly or do I maybe jeopardize my job?..**General Chat:** Fall is coming.  It finally rained here! Yay!!!! I've been waiting. This side of the country is SO DRY.  My grass went from straw to green with just three days of rain.  Today is sunny and tomorrow more rain... I kind of wish it was reversed.
**Triumph** Monday I got my tooth fixed. Infection and pain subsiding. Thinking is less spastic and impulsive. Had to face down the realization that my drinking was not the cause but merely masked the pain of the infection that was in my head. That pain and bizarre thinking was why I wanted to quit drinking. ..Once I did the math that rationalization returned that I could indeed drink but I just needed to see the dentist regularly. As I worked through it I realized that I enjoy being sober too much to go back to *beer worship.* Huge breakthrough for me. (Yes I am aware of the flawed thinking there! Hahaha)..**Struggle** I went to another AA meeting right after seeing the dentist. Some guy asked if I got novacained. Yes i did. My poor dentist is a buddy. And I am pretty spastic!..Years ago I had the *pleasure of a drug free root canal.* Let's just say I grabbed that dentist's wrist and almost put him in the chair to return the favor of scraping a live nerve from one of his pulp chambers. The guy had told me the nerve was dead and no need for novacaine. I was good with the drilling but the nerve scraping hit me like a bolt of lightning. Fortunately for the both of us I am able to turn OFF my *kill switch!* Especially when I catch myself so clearly overreacting...I was a little confused as the *no novacaine guy* extricated himself from our conversation. Instead of dismissing the guy as a crackpot I thought a bit about it and realized once again that sobriety is different for everybody. Judging him would have been as foolish as his judging me. Novacaine doesn't make me want to drink. I am honestly just grateful for that...And to be fair I met up with a guy later on with 28 years of sobriety under his belt and we hit it off just fine. I think there are benefits of AA and even if I may have pissed off one of my good buddies with my obstinance I am certain we're still good. He told me AA is total anarchy and that has helped. I suck at conforming to even non-conformity! *(And so did my ancestors even several hundred years ago!)*..**General Chat** Stopdrinking has been so helpful for me. I dont know if I will be able to tolerate the whole sponsor thing without inadvertantly deconstructing someone's psyche. Thats why all you guys have been so helpful. I am such a big fan of u/coolcosby's [Baby Steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2ree7a/hey_cc_im_newly_sober_what_do_i_do_next_the_baby/) because they're working for me...Getting close to starting Adderall again. It's going to be a transition but I think I am pretty much ready to bring all systems back on line and see how this new sober version of me runs. I am getting bored and think I've had a huge blast experimenting with social media. My conclusions are different from when I started out many months ago. I still think I am a little too spastic for live transmissions to the universe. I am sure I have inadvertently scared people with my silliness and penchant for pontification! I should save this stuff for art and friends family and colleagues and not expose my pulsating brain for future mankind to try and figure out. Somethings are better left to journals! Haha!..What has humbled me though is how awesome even complete strangers are. I never anticipated that I would learn so much from this experiment. I started out merely in search for a distraction from my brain's near unstoppable universal debugging momentum. So grateful for adhd! Going on *operation joy obsession* did the trick!..Thanks again SD! Sorry for these rantomanial comments. I think you can see why I end up deleting near 80% of these without hitting save! Thanks for not only tolerating me but for your examples struggles wisdom and especially kindness. You guys rock!
triumph - Started running regularly and wow. Elevated mood improved sleep increased confidence... it really makes the alcohol-induced version of those things seem pretty stupid. I'm still stressed by school/work in ways that should be over one way or another by next summer and it feels good to have chosen a new better way to take care of myself. ..I made an appointment with a counselor for next week. I feel like I don't have the time but I will do it anyway. ..struggle - I am sick and tapering down my caffeine use and exhausted from that plus running plus adjusting to a busier schedule. Time management continues to be a struggle. I will come up for air in a few months I guess...general - It's not fall by me until the 21st! Enjoying the last of the long days. Spending a lot of time on trails by lakes and llistening to the summery bugs. :)
Triumph: I have dealt head on with my responsibilities this week. I have been so stressed busy anxious and stretched thin but I still haven't drank or considered drinking really. It's not an option right now...Struggle: stress sucks man. It's so hard to let myself feel uncomfortable to accept that I can't just have an off switch to my anxieties and stress. ..I haven't had a drink today and I won't drink tonight!
Some days are just a day.  Nothing particularly great happens.  I feel kind of meh.  And then I remember: if I was still drinking I would be in utter hell right now.  And I'm not.  Meh is SO much better than hell...My worst day sober is still going to be better than my best day drinking.
Yup
