I was able to successfully quit drinking after 3(ish) years of alcoholism last fall. Unfortunately I relapsed in February and have been drinking since. I've been with a therapist the whole time. I'm a planner so I was looking for something to mark my "final drinking days". Coming off of a four day weekend I spent the last couple of days prepping the house and myself (and drinking while I still could)...Tonight is my first night back to sobreity. I've done this before and I know it is uncomfortable but I'm sick and tired of being fat hot and drunk. And so while my crazy neighbors shoot off mortars I will celebrate by playing Overwatch and sucking less than normal.

I'll join ya. See my recent posts. I'm kinda fucked up but I think life would be better without alcohol. Let me know if you want an accountability partner. Plus I might be interested in messing with Overwatch. All I do lately is work and work out but I have lots of game consoles and lots of GTX 1070s. Lol. I would need to buy a PC and put one of my 1070s in it but that could happen. Good luck to ya. Have a nice night m8.
Great choice! Enjoy the squeakers on overwatch I hope they are not drinking too. Power through and you'll be feeling great before you know it! I won't drink with you today as well!
