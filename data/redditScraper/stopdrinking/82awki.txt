It is day 3.  I have had periods before where I was on a work project for 2-4 days and alcohol was not available so I did not drink but those were not conscious decisions not to drink...only that it wasn't available. The job would come to an end I would feel great and subsequently go get a few drinks.  This would lead right back into the 5-7 day per week habit. . Reading everyone's experience and all of the details certainly helps so keep it up. If you have experienced something someone lurking is likely struggling with a similar issue as well and needs to see it. .My pattern typically was that I would have a heavy night of 3-4 beers combined with 3-4 strong cocktails (socially) followed by a recovery night of just one or two drinks.  This pattern would go on and on usually with a night of nothing to drink once per week. (See: night sweats resulting in wet sheets). .I categorize myself as a heavy social drinker and a light lone drinker.  I wasn't drinking a bottle of whiskey every night by myself but I wasn't happy with the fact I was doing something I couldn't stop even though I thought to myself I could easily stop.   Stopping was just so easy I would have a drink and think about how easy it was. Ironic?  If other people were visiting I was pounding drinks with them then as soon as they left I'd look at the drink I was holding realize the morning hangover was coming and pour it out.  Then I'd get a few glasses of water and go to bed. ..Travel for work is tough and is certainly a trigger but what isn't.  A warm day is a trigger. ..So today is day 3 with a real purpose to make an end to this unnecessary part of my life. .Day 1 included irritability lower back pain dry mouth and seemingly unquenchable thirst slight insomnia uncertainty and doubt. .Day 2 included dry mouth and thirst shoulder and back tension a stronger appetite than normal and night sweats.  .Day 3 was hard to get up for work but I have a very clear head today. Still have the general thirst (not as bad) a headache and shoulder tension. ..The unique thing about the people here is the realization of the issue at hand.  There are so many people addicted to drinking who are incredibly functional and not aware of the issue or who are secretly convincing themselves they are in complete control.   The last sentence sums me up pretty well. ..Quitting drinking is the only conceivable proof that one is in fact in control of their drinking.  ..

"Quitting drinking is the only conceivable proof that one is in fact in control of their drinking."..This!
Well said!..I think it's a great idea to document your withdrawal like this as something you can look back on later down the line when you get through it......I played 'withdrawal symptom Bingo' with myself for the first week or two and checked them off the list... from memory some digestive upset and mood swings can also be a feature over the coming days along with some anxiety and trouble sleeping.... it's all a temporary state and it does get better!..I helped things along with a daily probiotic fish oil multivitamin B-vitamin complex magnesium and zinc plus plenty of water fruits and vegetables as the boozer's diet had left me pretty short of all the good stuff.....Hang in there and keep us posted!..IWNDWYT ..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
