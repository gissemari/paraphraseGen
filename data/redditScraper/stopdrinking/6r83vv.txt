Just wanted to say thanks to this sub you guys have helped during the hard days when I needed a boost. The last few days have been a struggle but I pushed through it. If anyone out there is struggling hang in there it is so worth it. I am very proud of my number count and believe it or not it has also been a motivator for me to stay sober. 3 months ago I wouldn't have thought it was possible but if a 3/4 liter of vodka a day drinker can do it you can too! I will not be drinking with you awesome people today!

Congrats to you I'm on day 15. 100 feels like a lifetime away.
We have at least two things in common: we both used to drink lots of vodka and we both are amazingly not doing that today. Congrats on the centi-sober and I won't drink with you today!
Awesome buddy !! Well done for you :)) 
Congrats!  
Love it! I wish more people knew about this community. 
Congrats on 100 I am so happy you left the vodka days behind!! 
Right on! Congrats on the Big 1-0-0! Yay triple digits :) Good job. I will not drink with you tonight! 
Fantastic stuff well done...Just a warning I was 103 days and then BANG a 'life-problem' sent me back to hell. I fell off that wagon so quickly I could not believe it. It's taken me 30 days to decide today: I will not drink with you today ;-)
That's wonderful! Congratulations!!!  
Congrats!
