Today marks a 5-week stretch for me. I have officially left the gravity of all previous lessons I have learned as I have never made it this far. I am now in free-floating space wherein from here on out all lessons are entirely new...I'm focusing on remembering to keep positive thinking at the forefront of my mind today. I think I sometimes take for granted the fact that allowing negative thoughts to dominate my mind is (a) one of the things that will eventually bring me back to drinking and (b) futile given that I am but a drop of water riding inside of a wave much larger than myself. I may not be able to control the direction of the wave but in the least I can sit back smile and enjoy the ride...It's statements like that -- like "Think positive" -- that I sometimes take for granted. It seems like such a simple thing to do that I think that I a person who tends to expect WAY more complexity out of life than there really needs to be cynically doubt that it could ever be effective. And yet I know it is because the times I feel like I'm "struggling" are often defined by a lead-up in terms of weeks of negative thinking. I've seen it explained in posts here as well: relapse doesn't happen when we drink again; rather it often happens well before when we've stopped doing the work required to keep those cynical thoughts at bay...I am here. The wave is good. I can smile about this very moment and so I will. It's beginning to dawn on me that this recovery thing might really be THAT simple!
