Has anyone ever had these dreams/nightmares where they wake up afterwards and thought they drank last night?..Happened to me first time this morning after 51 days sober. I woke up and thought to myself: "Did I relapse last night??" Looked around my room and saw no empty cans or bottles and I didn't feel hungover. Realized then It had to have been a dream. It felt so vivid and convincing. Glad it was all in my head...IWNDWYT

I'm at a few years and I STILL have them. It's only a bad thing if I don't feel weird after having them ;p..It's funny because it always happens be an accident. Like I didn't have a choice in the matter. ..It's a dream it shows me I have strong convictions and I'm sticking to them.  I choose this way of life. 
Yep! They're so common that there is info in the sidebar! I had one last night too!
I'm only 12 days in and I've already had one. And I felt guilty in the dream for doing it.
