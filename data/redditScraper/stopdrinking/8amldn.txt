I'm  so upset. She knows  I quit drinking. Yesterday I begged her to not get any drinks but she did. She's  not too enjoyable to be around when she's  drunk. She slurs she'll  masturbate she falls and hurts herself. I love this girl to death. I wont stop being her friend. She has been there for me when i wasn't  too loveable. I don't  even know what to say to her. I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post this. Relapsing  has crossed my mind but I know it'll  make things worse  for me. Thanks  for letting me get this off my chest.

Sorry about your friend getting arrested. Maybe send her the link to this sub if she's interested?
The good news is that she is alive. She can survive everything else even though it might be embarrassing and expensive. 
I just made a post like this. I'm going through the same thing as you. It's awful to watch. 
So I'm a bit befuddled...would she get hammered and flick the bean in front of everyone?
Relapse is not a requirement. Having a drink or 12 will not help anything. Best of luck. IWNDWYT
