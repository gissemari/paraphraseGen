I started my sobriety Monday. Enough was enough.  This week was great... tough but great. By friday I had more energy and was brighter and happier working than I have been in a long time. Work wasn't an empty chore but it was something I was having fun with.  But man... Today.  This shit is hard.  My neighbors and friends are all out drinking in their yards.  Its just me and the wife today and I've been up since before 7am. Thats 13 hours of sobriety with nothing to do.  We went to lunch on the lake... No beer.  Its like 75 degrees and amazing... A perfect day for a drink.  God the urge is strong. My wife us on my side with this... But still I want a drink.  I can do this.  I will not drink today.  ..Thanks for listening I just needed to let it out.

The struggle is hard. I haven't made it to quitting but thinking about it more and more everyday. I commend you. 
Not drinking with you today.
In those moments I have enjoyed the hell out of an ice cold Diet Coke. It's not the same at first I know. It's not supposed to be the same. But I remember what alcohol has done to my family and to my body and relationships and it's worth it to try to stop. ..You got it. Keep on!
So happy you are committed to not drinking!! The struggle is SUPER real... I've been super struggling with horrible shakes so I totally understand the urge to drink. Mine is to make my shakes go away. BUT I am SUPER committed this time around. I will NOT drink with you! Yah! Even with the struggle I'm still happier.. 
The temptation is so real and so hard.  Congratulations on overcoming them. ..I always know that those good feelings are from being sober and I'm just deluding myself if at that point I tell myself a drink will make it even better! ..Hope you had a great weekend.
