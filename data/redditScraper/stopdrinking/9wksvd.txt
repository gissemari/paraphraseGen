Occasional poster in this sub. I made is a solid two weeks before I figured I'd naively try moderate drinking (IE a drink or two during social interactions or with dinner). And then out of nowhere when I thought I had gained control I went on a 4 day binge drinking about 18 beers a day. It's like I gave booze an inch and it took a mile. It's incredibly frustrating. My entire persona has been crafted over the years around booze and though I've done a lot to distance myself from it and become my own person it still haunts me. I want to control it and have the occasional drink but that seems like too slippery of a slide. It makes me feel weak. I see others at least on the outside being able to enjoy the casual aspect of drinking while I struggle with just my thoughts about it. Not even sure about the point of this post just wanted to vent I suppose. The good fight continues.

I feel ur pain Iwndwyt
I think once our brain's wiring gets messed up from too many years of too many drinks we lose our off switch.  I've tried moderate drinking so many times I've lost count.  ..But yes the good fight continues.
Such a good description give an inch and it takes a mile. I hate being a slave to this shit. I'm on day 3 once again. You may feel weak atm but you posted here and got through 2 days which is more than many can say. Keep it up  we got this so far.
