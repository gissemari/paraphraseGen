At midnight on June 6th 1944 40000 men jumped from airplanes in support of the dawn invasion of Normandy France. Amongst the men in the air and on the beach were men in recovery from alcohol and other substances. They were members of the then fairly new Anonymous program. Most stayed sober despite being in or close to combat. The numbers are not available to me but even one is enough to tell me that if they can do it it "should" be a piece of cake for me...and you if you want it and live it one day at a time. ..I'm not advocating one program over another and the non 12step programs are also fine in my opinion. I find easier access to help with Anon style programs. A drunk like me needs all the help he can get. Love you all stop struggling and save your fighting for Nazi's like they did. ..Edit: I am certain their were sailors in recovery there too thanks kstryker for the reminder! (As a former grunt I seldom remember you ship borne types)..Edit2: mapryan points out I gave the incorrect figure for airborne troops on d-day. 24000 is the correct figure for the number of brave men who jumped out of perfectly good airplanes into an unknown night.

As a sailor in the program I whole-heartedly share this sentiment. 
Speaking on in charge of logistics I'm sure it existed it was just too costly.
Just curious - where did you get the figure of 40000 airborne troops? I understand that Operation Varsity was the largest airborne operation of WWII and [that involved some 40000 paratroops](http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/205195403)
