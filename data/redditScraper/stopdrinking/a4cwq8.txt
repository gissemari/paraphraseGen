Hello all. I wanted to see if you guys had any tips on how i can go about helping my brother in his recovery. He has attempted 3 times this year to get sober but each time theres always something that makes him relapse. We sat down as a family last week to talk to him to consider getting help. He agreed to try it one more time and had moved back to my moms. So last wednesday my mom and dad had left for work and he was doing better. When they got home they found him on the floor passed out. My mom immediatedly started screaming because she really thought he was dead. Turns out he had a seisure and bit his tounge in the process. My dad who is also a recovering alcoholic told him he would drive him to AA. Brother was still in denial so dad calls an uncle and a cousin. Both of them convinced brother to get help. He accepted and We drove him about 2 hrs away to the aa my dad went to get help. Mom cried with him and was soo thankful for him getting help. She's went through soo much with my dad's adiction and was soo glad my brother decided to get help. My whole life I've waited for a day like yesterday. It takes courage to admit one needs help. I am really proud of him. I was just looking for people who have gone through this experience how can i help him or what can i do to reinforse/support his recovery. And to any one struggling out there when you are ready to get help do it. It just take that first step from your part. Thanks all.

For you try alanon...For your brother  until he wants to be sober he probably won't. ..Just my experience. 
In my opinion!!   Don't give out or state the obvious to him it really doesn't help. Understand that it's really hard for you but worse for him. I hated it but couldn't stop. One of the most motivational things for me was someone saying to another drinker just hurry up and get done with the drinking I am sure your brother knows he needs to stop but only he can decide when. There is a podcast called taking a break from alcohol by Rachel harte that changed my life. It thought me about how alcohol works on the mind and body once I learned this it was like a light switch went off. Nobody I ever came across including AA explained or made sense of my drinking but once I knew why and how I drank my mindset changed I could see alcohol for what it was!! I hope this helps!!
