Hi all this is my first time posting here. I'm just coming off of the back of a 5 day binge which left me with an absolutely brutal hangover. ..I decided that after 10 years heavy drinking the time had finally come to accept that I cannot control my impulse to drink and that total abstinence is the only way to improve my mental health and probably save my life...I'm struggling with anxiety at the moment. After a binge like that its no wonder but I don't find these first days too hard. In fact the thought of a drink now scares me. The difficult part for me comes later when I have recovered enough to start craving.. I worry about that day but today I wont drink..

this is the beginning of your new life :)
Well done for making the first steps!.And well done for having such a great name - it gave me a laugh on this rainy day :-)
In the beginning I worried about not being able to drink every again.  But you know what tomorrow is another day and I have no way of knowing what life will throw at me.  The only thing I can for myself is not drink today and work towards a better future.  Stay strong and enjoy your new sober life.
Congratulations on two days!
Good morning /u/DildoDogend and welcome to /r/stopdrinking -- at this [link is a post called the Baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  If you read around this sub for any while you will see it over and over again--but is intended to be a set of basic instructions for starting the process of stopping drinking.  I do these things and they work for me.  Good luck to you.
Welcome and I hope you keep posting. Have you tried the stop drinking chat room? I spent a lot of time there the first few months...Edited to add the anxiety is normal. I had brutal anxiety for the first few weeks. It got better.
