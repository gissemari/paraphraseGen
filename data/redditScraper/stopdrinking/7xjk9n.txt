I had to stay late at work yesterday.  I walked in the door at the AA meeting about 5 minutes late.  ..Usually I bring a pencil notebook highlighter and my Big Blue Book.  I had none of these so I felt naked.  I like to write down thougts during the meeting study my book when I get bored.  The meeting felt longer without these things...However I still went.  Unprepared but present.  I'm trying to hit 90 meetings in 90 days.  I'm very behind.  I think I'm at 3 meetings after 5 days.  But I'm kind of happy with myself for attending anyway...In any case just reporting another good day of not drinking.  I'm 5 days in but the "relapse" was just a couple of beers.  I haven't been drunk in 3 weeks now.  :)

You're doing awesome.  I knew when I started that 90/90 was just not realistic with my life and that was one of the reasons my first sponsor and I broke up- he insisted it was necessary I told him it wasn't realistic and I wasn't even going to try.  I think if you can do 4-5 a week you're ahead of the game.
Great. Notes at AA - never seen that before. but it can only help!
