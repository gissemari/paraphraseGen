So my body hit a wall this past Friday. On noon while at work I thought I was going to pass out from total exhaustion. My space is high up and enclosed by glass windows. The sun poured in from all sides and it was a beautiful day. Despite that I actually dozed off at one point. I desperately wanted to go to a meeting because Fridays are hard days for me sober or not sober but I was spent. So I trudged to my car and sat in miserable non-moving traffic for over an hour. Once I got home I crashed before the sun even went down. I slept for an eternity and woke up fatigued and with body aches. So I slept even more. I had all these plans scheduled for Saturday including a meeting but instead I slept FaceTimed with my boyfriend and finally made it to the store for some groceries. I will be honest I had intense cravings envisioning myself opening a wine bottle and pouring glass after glass of wine. But then I came on here. I read posts by people just like me who had decided to take that first drink. It didn't go well for them. Many of them said it didn't have the same effect that it once did. I could relate so then o played it forward from my first drink to the end of the night - what would it all look like? You see by the time I quit drinking recently booze wasn't doing what it used to do - it only relaxed me for a few short minutes and then I only felt pain so I drank even more to try and get that old euphoric feeling. The ol' gal just wasn't giving me the pleasure that she had in the past. Instead I was blacking out due to the fact that I was guzzling gallons of wine or beer and then chasing it with straight vodka or jack and then waking up with what felt like a spike in the middle of my brain. I write this on another Sunday totally sober. I'm sipping coffee and can actually taste the flavors. It doesn't taste bitter from leftover booze tongue from the night before. I have my blinds wide open in my bedroom with the sliding glass door ajar so I can hear the birds singing their morning songs. So if I had gone ahead and boozed it up last night I'd be lying here in total agony with the blinds pulled tight like the doors on a bank vault wanting to die. I'd say that this reality is a better one...I won't drink with y'all today! Happy Sunday! And for those who relapsed don't get too down on yourself. I myself did for 3 very long years - that doesn't have to be your fate. Trust though if you continue down that path or if any of you are thinking about picking up it DOES get worse way worse. I didn't listen to folks in the rooms about what happens. I thought I knew better. But they were right about everything. It gets way way worse. It did for me and now I have similar stories to what I had heard before I decided to go out again.
