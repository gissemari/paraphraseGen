Flair probably wont be up to date as I had relapsed. Booze is a strong drug and one that I have relied on heavily for 'support' the last five years...Have lost good jobs because of it. Lost out on love because of it. Have blank spots in my memory because of it...Been hard man. But easy at the same time. Can drive past a liquor store and not feel a need to stop in. Have learnt new ways to deal and cope with the downs that come at me. Yoga working out breathing techniques looking forward instead of back...Find something that will help you. Dont quit for anything/one else other than you. Get your mind geared toward living instead of drowning amd killing yourself slowly. ..I was lucky and decided to quit..it so happens that the day I decided was 9/1/18. I did not pick that date but i did realize what day it was after I had commited to quitting. Maybe it was chance maybe it was my subconscious or maybe it was some cosmic happen chance...but my drive and resistance to stay clean has rested deeply on that date. If I wanted to kill myself id rather it was quick and fully my choice...If I can do this you certainly can too. Just do it for yourself. ..911-8 is my date a wake up call I suppose. ..Cheers. Heres to many more 31's. I will not drink with you today tomorrow or ever again....

Congratulations on a month!     Sounds like you're learning some excellent ways to cope with the stuff life throws at you. Exercise is such a great way to destress and lift the mood that's a good reminder that I need to work it into my self care more consciously. Thanks! IWNDWYT
