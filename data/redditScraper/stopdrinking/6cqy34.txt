I relapsed on Thursday May 11th. It was the day after my last final also the day after I had an outburst at my female manager to the point I scared her...One habit of mine is that I aggressively seek cocaine when I am drunk. So I continued dipping into my checking and savings through out this past week and a half and drained it all; to the point I lost touch with reality and had a mental breakdown. I lost my job my family have disowned me and I'm miserable ATM...I'm in my new room that I had paid first and last months rent. Now I'm here sitting in bed knowing that I completely messed up and yet considering the fact that maybe I'll make it out alive yet again...I dropped my expensive course for summer session 1 to make sure I get the money deposited again in my account to pay for next months rent. I've been three days sober just sleeping every moment I can because it eases the pain and yet I'm hopeful...So much more happened guys but I don't feel I need to divulge it all. Just know that I'm completely in utter disappointment. Though just maybe I will survive this one last time. It's a disease. A slow form of suicide; it's a curse and I ask myself... wtf just happened? This has been the worst relapse but again the most enlightening. I can make it to the other side. I know I will. ..Just took a nice shower distracting myself with Comedy Central and HBO burgers soda and a few cigarettes. ..Feeling disappointed but enlightened at the same time. It's never been like this. Perhaps I have become the Phoenix. ..Some lovely advice would be the best thing right now. I'm gonna order a burger and watch a movie. Thanks stopdrinking. ..:)..-Victor

Hey Victor first of all glad you're here. Sounds like you rebounded rather quickly considering and it also sounds like your attitude is pretty good considering the circumstances. Try to remember that we're only in control of today and learning from your mistakes is important but feelings of guilt aren't productive. Make the pledge every morning to stay sober for the day and work to fix any damage you may have done. That's all you can do. Try and stay positive. As long as you're waking up and making an effort to better your life your time isn't wasted. Best of luck to you.
