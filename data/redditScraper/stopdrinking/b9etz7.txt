Not a whole lot to say except I think I've bottomed out.  Nothing spectacular no explosions or jail or hospitals - THANKFULLY.  I went out last night and I don't remember much.  Checked wallet all good.  Checked phone/FB/email all good.  Keys OK.  Dog OK.  Apartment has Pringles all over the place but OK.  Guys if this is a soft red flag for me I'm going to grab it with everything I have.  I haven't blacked out before and it's starting to happen.  I'm 4 years into a relapse and this is my chance.  Terrified of what that means but I know what I have to do.  Not sure why this feels differently than the other 100 Day 1 days I've had but it does.  I'm done I'm over it this isn't helping and I'm missing out on glorious amazing life.  Badge reset and ready for takeoff please.

Never miss an opportunity to do the right thing. My brain is great at making excuses. I used excuse to drink my whole life. Now I use excuses not to drink. Lent my birthday the dog peeing on the carpet... all excuses not to drink and do the next right thing. And wow is the synchronicity of life rewarding me for it. Keep fighting for the you that you want to be
Welcome back. Thank god you made it. ...It took me 18 years to get back into recovery - you're better believe it's my only priority. *Every* beautiful thing I have in my life is because of recovery.
