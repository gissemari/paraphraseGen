So this time around I am doing something different..I had 10 months 3 months and 9 months this time before my relapse. Each time I was told I should do something different and kind of did. But this time I'm really diving into therapy which I did not do before. It's tough and twice a week. It's also expensive but it's worth it. Cheaper then drinking honestly. It's really hard digging deep into my abusive childhood but it's really shining a light on my alcohol abuse and addictive personality. It was definitely a glaring issue I was tip toeing around. I always thought  Hey I am sober so that's it! . This time I am doing something different. It doesn't feel great but it's different and that's what counts!

That is awesome!  I go to therapy and it has really helped me!!.IWNDWYT.
I was told that therapy doesn't feel good and that means it's working. Growth comes out of discomfort. We are big plants in a small pot and we need to be repotted ..I opened all my emotional wounds open up over the last year relived through the abusive memories and re programmed all of the bullshit that was spewed into my head from addict parents. It was tough and I wanted to kill myself for a good 4 months straight cuz the pain was too much but I stuck it out and now am the most content I've ever been. I was a codependent adult child people pleaser now I am definitely independent (vow of celibacy and zero desire to get married or have children-- I'm 28) I've been learning boundaries and reversing the symptoms of being an adult child and definitely stopped people pleasing. I feel incredibly confident and thank God for AA I found SD about a month ago and it's been amazing but the --Anonymous community has been just...a miracle. Coda SLAA everything. So much has been worked out and for practically free. ..This lady is really good I went down a fantastic rabbit hole..https://youtu.be/WXzreQ7Svo0..Good luck you really are doing yourself the best. It may be painful but will be so worth it..&lt;3.
