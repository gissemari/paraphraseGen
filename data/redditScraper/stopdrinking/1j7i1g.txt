I wish I had better things to say but I'm struggling. I feel like I'm carrying around a bundle of bricks being sober and I have to put it down soon. It's really difficult for me to deal with emotions and stress and still maintain relationships. I miss having that shut off. Sorry to be negative or if this is discouraging to anyone I just need a place to say this. Thanks.

It takes everybody a while to get a handle on it.  It ain't easy but it is possible.  Life with out the booze is great but it does take time.  Try to hang in there.  Try to get some [support](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index) it is a hell of a lot easier.  Good Luck.
This too shall pass.   You do not have to do it alone.  Just as you shared here you could be sharing AA  smart a local outpatient group...Ours is a condition of isolation that can be escaped. See link below.

Stay strong. Stay busy. Eat lots of good food get lots of sleep. It's not worth it.
