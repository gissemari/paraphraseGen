Wow it's kind of surreal to have three months sober.  It simultaneously feels like yesterday  and like a whole lifetime ago that I made the decision to quit. ..I didn't even think I would *really* quit when I first told my wife I would.  I just wanted her off my back.  ..But when I went to my first AA meeting and met a room full of people who **enjoyed** being sober I started to think maybe sobriety isn't a punishment.  Maybe it's a gift...I've met a lot of people in 3 months who have reiterated that idea...I've now reached a point where I **want** to be sober.  I'm actively working on my sobriety though I'll admit I've been slacking on some things lately and I need to get my ass in gear on them if I want to stay sober.  I haven't had a strong urge to drink in some time- maybe 1.5 months?  Any ideas of "someday" usually fade almost instantly...So to those of you out there still struggling my only advice is to try to look at sobriety as a gift as something you'll do anything to achieve.

Yes! So happy for you! I was certain sobriety would be the worst. I was pissed that I'd been sentenced to it. But after about 4 months I finally realized it was the opposite of a punishment. I was free! It feels wonderful I never want to go back. ..Keep it up! I won't drink with you. 
I sure hope I can get there! I'm back to day 1 :( .Don't mind the badge. 
Nice! It's such a great turning point when sobriety becomes a gift and goal isn't it?
