I'm having a hard time tonight.  My husband was working late and then going out with a friend and I took the opportunity to read a book on codependency and journal.  To make a long story short though I can't argue that I have become to rely on alcohol my problems are rooted in codepdency and my husband seriously has issues as well...I am sober and was feeling a moment of peace--of a small smidegon of progress and peace about understanding what codependency is. (I'm realizing that though I was abusing alcohol most of my issues lie in having a very hard time with boundaries and self medicating. I'm in therapy and making progress).   My husband came home early and (I had made the mistake of saying what book I was reading) and he says "so...you think we have codependency issues.  I guess that is a no brainier given your problem"...I want to cry.  My problem?  I've been codependent since we met.  I was married to a sex addict.  I've come so fucking far.  I take responsibility for the issues I've caused but I'm trying and I'm human. ..I don't understand how to separate my own emotions from his constant pain.  This is very hard..
