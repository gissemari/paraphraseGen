And the accomplice was a 22oz. bottle of beer.  Fairly low alcohol content.  I stopped with that one bottle so I do not count this as a total failure.  This is the latest in a series of mistakes over the last two weeks.  These have included 1 line of coke 3 cigarettes (one after the other) and pot smoking (twice).  And on top of that I am not meeting my fitness or diet goals.  ..The other side of the coin is that I am more in control of myself then I think I have ever been.  It has been 3 weeks since I stopped drinking daily and the changes are all for the best.  I just can't seem to fully break from my old life.  Maybe I'm just bored.  Maybe it's just laziness; the old behavior patterns take little effort.  Maybe I am afraid of being healthy and happy.  ..A mentor once said to me; "You have to learn to love the struggle."  I fear that this may be the case.

On the road of sobriety we step over bodies all the time. Some of them are our own mistakes. The road is still there in front of you.
Hey it's not how you fall it's how you get back up. I was at 8 days when I relapsed I was sooo afraid of drinking and then when I did it was like "meh. hardly worth it." I kept on thinking how my badge was going to reset! Good luck.
After I crossed the line into alcoholism; it didn't matter how much I drank; the drinking kicked off the mental illness--the obsessive/compulsive thinking.
