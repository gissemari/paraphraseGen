Found this site by chance and so glad I have. Always struggled with moderating alcohol from my teens mum was (in recovery and now has dementia) an alcoholic dad drinks excessively but in a functioning kind of way. Kind of the norm for me.....booze was the way forward and it made me feel good/happier! Or so I thought....I've recently had my third child of which I went without a drink for over a year only to ruin it by thinking I needed drink to be  normal  worst mistake of my life....i don't drink daily but when I drink I drink! No thought to my children waking up leaving my partner to deal with it all completely bloody selfish cow if I'm honest. Sick of the guilt and remorse I feel never mind the lack of brain power I forget everything. Given my parents you think I would stop right!?! ..I felt amazing whilst not drinking and I'm lucky that it's only been 7 months since I last stopped I also have the bad habit of smoking whilst drinking which I hate even more. Nothing good has ever come from my drinking nothing particularly bad either but I am riddled with guilt and know I drink way too much. ..When I didn't drink I remember being clear headed less forgetful brighter skin and hair learning how to just relax and snooze on the sofa instead of passing out drunk on it. I want that back and I'm going to get it for myself and my children. ..Glad I've met others who continue this struggle but I know it gets easier and I'm looking at you guys to be my good/bad devil   We all have them.... ...
