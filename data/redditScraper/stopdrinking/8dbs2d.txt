Hey all..I won't bother you with a long-winded story but just know that I was sober for YEARS before I somehow talked myself into drinking again. ..Things spiraled out of control almost instantly and now it's one year later and I have been binge drinking myself into blackout states every weekend. My hard fought progress is gone and I'm back at the grind. ..My lizard brain wants me to keep drinking but I want my old life back so IWNDWYT! ..Cheers pals
