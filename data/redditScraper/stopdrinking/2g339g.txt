Its going well I am trough the withdraws and I am feeling good...I changed absolutely everything. My divorce is final. I moved to a big city (Johannesburg) where I go to a meeting every day. Started a new job that's not in the alcohol industry. During the day I do the exact opposite to whatever my inclinations are. ..I am really riding the good feels at the moment but I know from experience that the initial feelings are going to go away again...I need you guys to remind me of the pitfalls all those little things to avoid embrace or whatever. I get overwhelmed with angst when I think about this and  it clouds my thinking dramatically. ..I need something (hopefully this post) to return to when the insane thoughts return. I am going to need help.

Relax and ride that pink cloud for all it's worth...It's just like us alcoholics to scale the mountains and having reached the summit needing to pole vault over mouse turds...Those 'little things' to avoid?  There's only one thing to avoid and that's taking a drink...Skip the angst.  Just remember to reach out to others now when times are good and establish support for your decision and let the strength of others carry you when things are rough...My solution to fear of relapse was to get into service with my meeting early and often.  That way I was committed to attend whether I felt like it or not...Thanks for posting and keep in mind that you deserve every good thing that comes your way right now.
When I'm drinking I am a mean bitter person. I isolate from friends and family members. I put my job at risk by calling out of work because I'm hungover and then continuing to drink because the hangover spurs a craving of alcohol for me. I spend money unnecessarily on all kinds of things in addition to the money I waste on alcohol. I get the shakes when I drink. BAD. I have a hard time remembering things. DID I MENTION I GET MEAN AND BITTER?!?!?! I become my worst self when I'm drinking...When I'm sober I can create - create art and relationships and be productive at work. I can cultivate relationships with loved ones. I am empathetic and nurturing when I'm sober. I can pay my bills have nice things and put a little money away. I can face life on life's term and do it with grace and humility. ..Life sober is tough but life drunk is worse...
I keep wondering how I am going to fill in all my free time but then as my days go by I complain I have no free time. When getting proper sleeping hours working everyday and spending the time I should with my daughter and wife there is no time left... I have been known to not make it home from work get in as late as 4 am and call in sick. My wife's joke (well not joke but angry saying) was "are you calling in drunk again?".I can not really remember why I drink but I remember why i quit. All I know is I like to get really fucked up when I drink beers. shots. drugs. the whole deal.... I don't have the shakes or feel like I am going to die when I don't drink so I have no reason to drink but a few reasons to not drink... I hope this helps it helps me...

Good for you! ..Pitfall to avoid: beating yourself up over past relapses. Just because you relapsed before doesn't mean it will happen again. Keep doing what you're doing and reach out when you need help. It doesn't need to be more complicated than that. 
You seem to be on a good path - read the posts here if you need to remember or take a newercomer out for coffee or tea after the meeting.
Remember those withdrawals. Remember that next time they'll come back worse. Remember how much they fucking suck...With that said.. there's so much you can do with your time now. Your life isn't in fast forward - you get to spend those days without just being a passive part of them.
Constantly remind yourself that you made a decision to be sober and that decision stands. If you've ever made a decision in your life to never return to some person place or thing add your commitment to becoming sober to that list. Mentally block it in with any life-changing lasting decision you made. ..Sobriety tests your integrity; sometimes it is easier to consider it a challenge and a test of your own character than a chemical addiction or psychological addiction. As frequently as you can for as long as it takes remind yourself that you are a person with integrity. Integrity is something that is incompatible with going back on a good decision isn't it? Remind yourself that you are a strong person with unshakable moral character and integrity and that you will commit to practicing this every day. Not drinking is just one part of that- it doesn't even have to be the major focus if that helps you to think of it in that way. You said you changed everything in your life and for the better. You obviously are capable of making lasting decisions that reflect the person you wish to become. You don't question those decisions now that they are final- stop questioning this one as well. Whenever you are tempted or feel low immediately remind yourself that as a person with strong character who made a final decision to quit drinking you refuse to entertain being a hypocrite even for one second- it's completely incompatible with your nature as a strong person.. .Maintaining this mindset helps me get through the tougher times and I hope it helps you also.
Don't ever lose sight of the fact that you are saving your life here.  ...Those of us with [this panel of eleven genes](http://news.medicine.iu.edu/releases/2014/05/genes-predict-alcoholism.shtml) respond to alcohol differently than other people and need to take extra precautions to stay safe.._______________________________."It is easier to behave your way into a new way of thinking than it is to think your way into a new way of behaving."...Friendships are touchy at this stage. Old mostly based-on-drinking-and-doing-things-together-drunk are dying their core exposed as dangerous to you and new sober friendships hardly have put down roots. .______________________. Don't waste time mourning the past.  What's done is done.  What you have is the now.  If you are doing only positive things (doing anything that does not include drinking essentially counts as a positive at this point) this eventually becomes habit so keep it up...You may want to try just wandering around the local library.  PM me if you'd like a small varied list of fun interesting books the kind that suck you in to the story and time goes by like *that*..____________________..Sometimes sobriety is "One Day At A Time"...Sometimes it's "One Hour At A Time"...And sometimes it's "One Minute At A Time"...You can do this.  We're all pulling for you.
You sound like you're on the right path my friend congratulations for making it this far!  When I was first getting sober I never experienced the natural high of being clean (the pink cloud) but over the years I've learned what I need to plan for when the urges and sneaky thoughts return:..**1)  Build a safe haven for yourself by eliminating ALL alcohol from your house and do not allow anyone to bring any into your home.**  Your home will be your oasis from a world filled with alcohol ads bars liquor stores urges depression and former drinking buddies so be certain to keep it alcohol-free...**2)  Do not kid yourself into thinking you can go to a bar (or a party) and just drink soda.** First it will be absolute torture and second if friends/family won't remain sober for a few hours to hang with you then screw them. You might have to endure some lonely weeks or months but it won't last.  Soon you'll be making different friends with people who aren't alcoholics...**3)  Get a list of phone numbers from meetings and then find new meetings and get more numbers.**  When urges hit and you're able to wrestle your demons to actually call someone not everyone will be available in your hour of need. So you need a solid list and a back-up list in case people are sick working sleeping or simply unable take your call...**4) Make sure you eat 3 healthy meals a day and have healthy snacks in between.**  I'm not saying you can't eat fried Oreos or have grilled cheese sandwiches smothered in butter but it's important that you don't let your blood sugar drop to a level where you'll become weak impulsive or lose your resolve...**5) Read other people's stories of recovery.** Do you enjoy reading?  Check the sidebar here under "Wisdom Books Videos...etc." and commit to reading how other people got sober...**6)  Get yourself a journal and start writing about how you're feeling and what you're doing.** Record your highs lows and little tidbits of wisdom or quirky sayings you might have picked up from a meeting or a book. It was a lifesaver for me to be able to look back and read how I made it through impossible urges or the lowest lows of my life. And as you build more sober time these journals will help to "keep it green" and remind you of how hard you struggled to actually get sober and reclaim your life...**7) Get yourself on a schedule and give yourself a routine.** You're working so you already have a basic routine but write one out and put it where you can see it and do not waver from it. I'm not saying you can't sleep in on a Sunday morning but you want to re-wire your mind and body to keep focused and on task. Downtime can be scary and anxiety producing so it helped me to always know what I was supposed to be doing next...**8)  Keep your home neat and clean.**  This might sound silly or obvious but leaving dishes to sit in the sink or last night's pizza box on the couch is a lapse and a moment where you didn't care enough to keep your surroundings in order. You would be surprised how seeing order and structure around you helps to keep your mind focused and calm...**9) Spend time doing what brings you enjoyment or pleasure.** Did you used to love jogging? Find those old sneakers and schedule an hour to run. How about cooking? Take a cooking class where you can get out and meet people. Love to break a sweat? Find a local gym or rec center. As your work your program it's important to smile and enjoy life too...**10) Find something to be grateful for on a daily basis.** When I was torn apart by depression not knowing if my marriage would survive one of us getting sober the sun still came out and these tiny purple flowers continued to bloom and little old ladies smiled at me in the grocery store - maybe the only human interaction they had that day. I learned that in the midst of my horrible urges depression and relationship crisis there was always a tiny bit of good happening around me and if I chose to peek at it a little bit longer my pain would always disappear. 
Everyone has pretty much said what I was thinking of but I am saving this post for future use aswell!..Also congrats on 11 days and great job on changing your life around like that. I applaud you!
