Feeling so depressed. Anyone experience this upon quitting drinking? I thought I was supposed to be floating on pink clouds and stuff... this is why people relapse I think. I'm not going to. I have been working out twice a day and it's not helping but I'm not giving up.

I wish I could help. Are you diagnosed with depression? Maybe you should see a therapist; it helps to get this kinda stuff off your chest and to have someone invested in your wellbeing...Good work on the self improvement! 
Hey /u/Thefallingsky it takes time.  When I drank I did a lot of damage to my brain and my body.  Ethyl alcohol (ETOH) is a neurological depressant anesthesia actually.  Over time ETOH overdosing interfered with my brain connections and the chemical in my brain called GABA which is a special amino acid that allows neural pathways to form.  I was neurologically sick and depressed.  But just some weeks sober and I felt so much better sharper happier but it took sustained time sober.  Hang in there friend.
I was definitely MORE depressed the first two weeks when I quit drinking (this time and other times) but the longer I'm sober the easier it gets to work on the depression.  Thing is although alcohol is a depressant and was making me more depressed I started drinking initially because of existing depression.  Quitting alcohol doesn't make that depression go away but it allows me to work through my depression with a clear head.  If I was drinking I couldn't address the depression at all I would just continually be adding to it.
There's a lot of emotional swinging in my experience. I think I didn't expect to be happy--just kind of kept with the game face. There were good days and there were shitty days. Didn't matter. So hang tough and keep going.
