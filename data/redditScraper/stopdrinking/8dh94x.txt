I feel like I get reminded of this all the time but it's really true. I was feeling the cravings really hard - boredom at work is my #1 trigger - so I came here. I read a few threads. I posted in the check-in and said ok no drinking for me today. And suddenly the cravings feel manageable again. ..If you're struggling too try that.

Totally agree...I had a free day today. I knew I was in danger of getting a few drinks in and demolishing my day that way...Instead I checked in here this morning and promised not to drink. ..And here I am had a productive sober day at home. ..IWNDWYT 
Just checking in iwndwyt
The daily check ins were a huge part of my routine in the beginning. I've kinda gotten away from it but I should get back to it again.
I think of the check-in as the sub within the sub.  I enjoy it a lot.  .
I hope I don't lose sight of this tool and what it's doing for me.  So I'm not gonna not today.  Thanks for checking in with me it's a big help!..IWNDWYT
