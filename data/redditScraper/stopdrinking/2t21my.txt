Hi everyone. Been lurking on this sub for a couple of weeks now and thought I'd finally make my first post!..I've been an alcoholic for around 7 years. I've tried to quit a few times in the past but always end up relapsing. Over the last few years I've seen the really terrible side of my alcoholism. I haven't drank for fun in years. I drink because I'm a drunk. ..Anyway my last drink was on Christmas day (12-25-14). I haven't drank in 26 days and I won't today either!

Welcome /u/thebeav26 -- didn't I run into you over on /r/alcoholism a couple of weeks ago?  Nice to see you on SD.
Fantastic job and congratulations.  Good to have you here.
I didn't drink for fun for years as well.  Good to have you on board. 
Hey Beav! Welcome. See you around.
