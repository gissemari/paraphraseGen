Kind of freaking out about this along with meetings she is a massive part of my support system. Any tips on staying stronge would be mucho appreciated. I plan to get in more meetings. I saw a guy slip after eights years everything about this has shook me. I feel for him and cant help think shit that could be me! Just feeling uneasy and trying to relax and enjoy the rest of summer but its hard not having the support of my counsellor for five weeks. Its the one place i ask of to pour my heart out i try to give positivty and strenght when other cross my path cause im aware everyone is struggling. So yeah some advice would be good and much appreciated. Thank you in advance

I had something similar happen to me early on when one of my mentors and most supportive people in my recovery moved back to another state. It was tough. Going to more meetings is a great idea. I'd take advantage of getting the opportunity to share and express what you're feeling when you can. Speaking of meetings if you don't have a sponsor now might be a great time to get one (assuming you're going to AA). My sponsor has at times been my sounding board. I've gotten to unload of bunch of things with him that I might share with a therapist. Stay strong you can do it!
Great suggestion by /u/Ihearcolor -- I'd also suggest that you stay close to us.  Do the daily check-in and share here with us.  We're not like the rest of Reddit.  This is a full on support subreddit and snark-free zone.
Does she have someone filling in for her while she is gone? I might ask her this.
