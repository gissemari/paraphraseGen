I celebrated my one year sober anniversary last week and I've been wanting to post but have felt like I needed to make some deep meaningful post that would "change lives." I realize that that is my out-of-control ego talking so I'm "sticking it" to my ego and making a short and sweet post. :)..From 2013-2015 I could not even imagine making it through an entire day sober. I had tried to get sober many times and failed disastrously; I had been hospitalized sought treatment tried AA and nothing "worked." I truly felt doomed. But finally it clicked. I'm not sure why or how as I didn't do anything differently but I finally managed to get one day sober... then one week. My month sober anniversary was one the happiest days of my life. And now I'm sitting at over a year still taking it one single day at a time. If you're struggling and feel like you'll just never get it **keep trying.** If something hasn't worked so far don't write it off yet- it might just become an integral part of your recovery in the end...And always remember you *are* loved...(Now where's my damn Dino invite? I've been DYING to get in there for AGES. ;) )
