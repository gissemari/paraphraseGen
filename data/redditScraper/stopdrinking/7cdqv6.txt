...and that's about the only thing keeping me from drinking right now. It's been a miserable three days of intense craving. All day and all night thinking of alcohol. ..I woke up this morning from a dream I was lost in a freezing pre-Soviet mountainous foreign country wandering the streets estranged from my family. I was ushered into someone's home. A warm feeling of hospitality. Dim lamps and a fire. I couldn't understand the language. I could tell I was close to death. They brought out a small kettle and poured me a cup. I put it to my mouth and felt a hot alcoholic drink flood through my veins. My body and mind were instantly anesthetized. Fear and confusion slipped away. ..And I woke up. It took me a few hours to accept I didn't drink last night. I may as well have...It wasn't long before the craving returned and it didn't leave my mind all day again. I'm rereading This Naked Mind and Stop Drinking Now. My mind feels numb. I feel like a zombie at a used soul dealership where they're trying to sell me my soul back...The misery and shame of relapse... the fear motivating me to stay put. My heart rate is moving in gradual waves. Cold water. Hot water. Strength. Release. Wisdom. Failure. It's in my mind. Then why does it matter. It's only to mask the void of the meaning of life. Then why does it matter. It's only one night. It's always only one night. It's just for a day. It's only for today...But as my doctor says  There's no motivator like pain.  And so for now I'm motivated to keep very still for the hour and forty five minutes it takes for the store to close. I'll miss my friend behind that counter tonight even if I can't understand his language..

Is it a relapse? Or have they just been breaks in between boozing? Have you ever made a decision to quit and do everything in your power to change your path?..When everything changed for me was when I made a decision to stop intoxication and did everything in my power to change my path. It was a decision that I felt in the marrow of my bones. ..I used to "relapse" all the time when in fact I'd never changed anything just realized booze brought misery upon me. The fact was that I wanted to get fucked up more than I wanted to stay sober...The minute I decided I wanted to be sober more than I wanted to drink that is when it clicked. It can for you as well. I had to cut out the bullshit and excuses. My ass was raw from sitting on the fence for too many years...........
I made a decision to quit on June 17th 2017 after 30 years of heavy drinking. Since then I've had 4 or 5 nights of drinking. I prayed. I vowed. I fought with everything I had to point of passing out (sober) and bashing my face in on a hearthstone. It has taken everything I have to come this far. Everything...But 30 years is a long time. Formative years. It's all I've ever known. Every cell in my body and brain. In my grave the drinking hand keeps lifting to the face like the twitching tail of a lizard. My mind is like a ghost. My whole life.
