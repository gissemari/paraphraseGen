During the workday yesterday I'd got it in my head that I was going to drink last night. Fuck it I'm tired of all this shit I just want to have a drink. So I went home with the full expectation of either going to the liquor store and getting a bottle or to a bar to zone out for a few hours. I'd just have a few to relax just like everyone else can do. ..Well I got home took a shower ate something read a book for a bit and then went to bed. I don't really know what happened but I just didn't do it. I stayed home and went to bed sober. It's weird but I feel today like I crossed a significant threshold yesterday. I've been sober 7 months now but it was such a struggle every day. Now I don't know why but it feels a little easier. ..That's all you guys are awesome and I always find your posts helpful and encouraging even though I mostly lurk. .
