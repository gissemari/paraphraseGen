I love that some of my favorite bands have songs I can relate to...*Walking through the shame of this relapse.The mirror doesn't lie when it's scolding me.I'd love a little faith with this afternoon.And come quickly.....Oh I know.I'm holding on.I'm holding on to a ghost.I know.I'm tangled up.I'm tangled up in your ropes.I know.I'm skipping work.I'm skipping work like a stone.I know.It's ok I'm not a-ok right now*..https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51RWEKX_Sb8

I've listened to a ton of music and you're right.  It's a form of voluntary hypnosis.  This mix is just beautiful if you like an hour of trance but I found it very positive feeling. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2X6RyTRyww](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2X6RyTRyww)
I always love listening to Rebelution or Soja when I'm feeling down or wanting to get drunk. Definitely helped me out a lot tonight. Just put in some chill music and didn't get drunk!
