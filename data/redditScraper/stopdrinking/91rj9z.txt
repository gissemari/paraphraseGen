I was talking to my therapist and saying that I want to stop drinking but I'm worried I won't be able to. She said the most important thing is that I want to stop drinking and to focus on what I want...That doesn't make sense in a way because I want to stop (relapsed after 3 years one month ago) but when I want to drink I really want to drink! So how can I stop by focusing on what I truly want when sometimes I just want a drink!..

Why do you want a drink?  You know it is bad for you you know it fucks up your life and your health so why do you want it?  What problem is it fixing?  Is it to releive stress?  Then maybe you really want to be stress free more than you want a drink.  
Wanting to be sober is a long term goal wanting a drink is a short term goal. We all make tradeoffs like that every day. I really want to take today off because I don't feel like working but long term I want to be in good standing with my job so I won't do that. I want to eat ice cream for dinner but that doesn't fit into my longer term health goals so I eat spinach instead. Etc...Reminds me a bit of the marshmallow experiment! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment
It can be scary to think in terms of "Oh my god I'm never going to have another drink again. What about my wedding toast?? What about etc..." At the beginning it was helpful for me (and I've read for a lot of people) to think much smaller: "I'm not going to drink at think lunch meeting." And then "tonight I'm not going to have those evening drinks." And so on. Then it just becomes a matter of string those small decisions together. Pretty soon it's been a day and then a week and the boulder has started rolling. But it needs to start with those small decisions one day at a time. For example: I will not drink with you today!
