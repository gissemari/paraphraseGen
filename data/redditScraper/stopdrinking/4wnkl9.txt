"You're a different person when your drinking I don't like that side of you". My first girlfriend said this to me a few months before we broke up. I was 18 didn't have much experience with drinking yet. We went to a party and I blacked out. I made a mess of it said a lot of things I would later regret and a few months later we broke up. I put it behind me as I had bigger things on my mind at the time. I just graduated and was getting ready to move to the Big City. ..**Yet... I continued to drink.**.."I think he is waking up thank God! Can you hear me?" This time it was my mothers voice speaking. I'll never forget the look on her face it was a such a strange mixture of sadness and relief. I hope I never see it again. This time I was a freshman 19 years old just moved to the Big City from Nowhere USA. I started a relationship with another girl; one night we went out drinking and ended up taking acid together. Somewhere through the course of the night I tried to kill myself. The only reason I didn't that night is because I mistakenly swallowed a bottle of cough medicine instead of the benzos I intended on taking. I checked myself into a hospital nearby and woke up the next day to my family huddled around me...**Yet... I continued to drink.**...At 20 I tried to kill myself again. I was drowning in the pain of yet another failed relationship. One drunken night I decided to go for a drive. I was driving on the highway in the left hand lane. I was probably going 70-80mph I remember speeding up towards a sharp bend and just yanking the steering wheel to the right as hard as I could. The car began spinning immediately violently all I could hear was the tires squealing loudly. I vividly remember my car spinning between two other cars as I traveled from the far left lane towards the far right lane. Somehow I didn't get hit... My car stopped in the furthest right lane. I put it in 1st and  drove to the next exit got off parked and cried as I shook violently from the adrenaline. ..**Yet... I continued to drink.**..."I don't even know who you are anymore". One of the last things my ex-wife said to me before leaving me. We were young got married too quickly became co-dependent when we moved to a new country together. On paper we weren't perfect but my drinking was the wedge that drove us apart. I stayed relatively sober in the beginning but like so many of us do I relapsed. I hit the alcohol hard ballooned in weight drank daily grew distant and combative. I don't blame her for falling out of love with me. If I didn't love me why would she? We divorced when I was 22. ..**Yet... I continued to drink.**.."Don't you remember anything? You were such an asshole last night!" My current girlfriend said this to me two weeks ago. We were in the process of moving to another country to do so involved taking a ferry for a few days. For whatever reason once we got settled into our cabin I decided to have a beer. 10 beers later I blacked out and well once again made a complete ass of myself and said a lot of things I would later regret... ......Something was different about this latest slip up. I had always felt ashamed of myself in the previous memories I presented but this time I felt a deeper shame. Maybe the psychic burden of a life time of relapses burned bridges failed relationships and friendships had finally caught up with me. Maybe it was the months I went without hearing from any of my old friends months of not getting any messages or calls slowly gnawing at me. Maybe it was just the way my girlfriend looked at me that day. Whatever it was something struck a chord with me...I am going to do it. I'm going to kick this thing. I'm still on this Earth even though I shouldn't be. I've tried to kill myself twice and failed both times. I've burned nearly every bridge I have left ruined a marriage and tons of healthy relationships. I've got no friends left save for my current girlfriend and I will be damned if I lose her too. All of this because of some liquid in a bottle and a disease encoded into my genes. I need to stop now because I don't know how many live's I have left in this game...The sad thing is there are a dozen excuses I could come up with right now to justify my drinking again to myself. I've gotten really good at justifying my drinking to myself. I could choose from; my isolation in a foreign land where I have no friends my past relationships my failed friendships ect...  Though I don't need excuses right now. What I need is penance. So today I am not drinking and this time I hope it's for good. Alcohol has never brought me any good now I must repair the damage it has wrought on my life...If you read all of this thank you I just needed to get this off my chest. I wish you all the best..

Welcome /u/Sober_Throwaway123 to /r/stopdrinking -- at this [link is  a post called the Baby Steps which has some ideas for starting the whole sober journey](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) based on some instructions I've picked up along the way which work for me.  Good luck to you.
Welcome. You can do it
Glad you're here.  Use the Baby Steps.  Make a plan and share it...There's a recommendation that really got me started on a stable footing: "do 90 meetings in 90days".  I so wanted to be successful that I dud 147...I've not looked back.
Hi and welcome! So glad to have you in our awesome community! Please don't beat yourself up; this is not easy but it's so worth it. My life has never been better! If I were you I'd take advantage of SD right away; CC's Baby Steps the resources in the sidebar on the right see if you're interested in AA or support groups visit a doctor to discuss this in detail and try to ease withdrawals whatever it takes. I'd hang out here at SD as much as possible; we're in the same boat we understand we're here to help. So post / read / reply / vent / chat..we're happy to be your outlet. Looking forward to seeing more of you and hearing some great progress :).
When your addicted brain feeds you those justifications remember this: alcohol fed alcoholism is going to kill you it won't fail at it forever. ..There's a solution. .WELCOME
Welcome to you.  I was a master at the justification for why I drank but those justifications became more and more feeble even to me.  ..&gt;I need to stop now because I don't know how many live's I have left in this game...You've got *one* life -- what's your vision for how you truly want it to be?  I love that others are mentioning a plan...that's how I get from today to my vision.  My plan starts every day with the intention and commitment to not drink *today.*  Just today.  I let tomorrow take care of itself but funny tomorrow keeps turning into today. Hang with us; we'll walk this path with you.
I gave up two years of of sobriety. I still have my job kitty apartment and family. It's like I'm living a double life though.do I give it up and live with the stigma or do what I feel and not know the outcome. 
Welcome to SD! Wishing you the best as well &amp; looking forward to seeing your future posts &amp; comments when you are ready 
i'm glad you're here. this is an awesome caring community. i hope that you get the support that you need here so you *can* finally kick this thing. let's beat it together!
Great to have you here.  .
Im echoing some of the other comments you'll definitely want to get sober the smart way...see a doctor or check in to treatment because detoxing by yourself can be super dangerous. I'm not sure how often or how much you drank but you owe it to yourself to get assessed. Be honest about your history and you'll start off on the right track. ..     Glad you're here and had a moment of clarity. It's rough at the beginning but this will be the best decision you've ever made.
Good luck and strength to you! Every one here wishes you all the best too!
Good luck and strength to you! Every one here wishes you all the best too!
Glad you're here you can do this!
Thank you for sharing with us. Sounds like you have a lot of really good reasons to stop drinking. A lot of your memories resonated with me. It's amazing how many times I continued drinking even though the signs telling me to stop were right in my face. 
Glad you're here :) Sounds like you're ready to make some real changes.
Hang in there dude. Powerful story. Reminds me a lot of my own. If you are ready to stop this is a great place to come each day to fortify your resolve. I feel for you I have been where you are-- no one calling friends and loved ones afraid of or disgusted by you-- but it can change for the better. In my case I got most of the relationships I thought I had destroyed back...Good luck to you man!
