I suppose that's a postive. And I don't feel quite like a wreckless jackass or pathetic. ..&amp;#x200B;..I do still just feel angry. Angry about my social life and just how things played out.... Just angry in general. I'm putting on the front of trying to be real nice to people cause other people don't deserve to deal with me just cause I'm pissed off... I'm angry that I can't feel happy. And I don't feel much in me but like a void. ..&amp;#x200B;..And my life isn't really so bad I have a decent job and roof over my head. I'm just lonely. ..&amp;#x200B;..I've put some feelings out to a few therapist I'm gonna try to get something concrete on the 26th. I'm not going to drink but feeling this way is the exact feelings like I drank to avoid. I just genuinely don't like the person that I am. ..&amp;#x200B;..Kudos to everyone else putting the effort in. Just seeing other people log in about there days and their struggles helps me.

During the first month my emotions were all over the place.  The more time I had sober the more peace I found. Smart move going to see a therapist.  I hope you feel better! Congratulations on day 19! IWNDWYT 
Oooh I was angry for a while when I first quit. To the point that people in my life pointed it out to me. I'm not saying there aren't real emotional issues we need to work through I'm saying that over time not drinking I finally had the time to process a lot of that and work through it and emotionally things are a ton better for me now and I'll bet with time the same may well be true for you as well...Nice work on 19!
