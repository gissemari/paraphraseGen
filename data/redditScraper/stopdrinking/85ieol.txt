Relapsed before making it to a week...It was getting easier...The drinking went badly -- I really fucked things up this time...I'm going to redouble my efforts to quit now and take this as a cautionary tale...Things just go badly when I drink and it's affecting my mental health.

How do you propose to redouble your efforts to quit? 
It's ok man. Your inherently doing better cause rather than "just going about your business" doing drunk ass shit you recognize that you gotta fight the shit. Now you have confirmation that it's hard. And because of your failure you have more information about how to quit the shit for good. All failures are positive as long as they help you stay in the pocket. ..Give yourself a break. Say "whoops" and get back up. I'm by my phone all day if you need a hand
I'm doing a 30 day challenge. Join me.
But you came back and that means a lot!
