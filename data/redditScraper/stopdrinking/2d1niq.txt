*To Wives* (P. 116-conclusion)..[Lois Wilson](http://newlifehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/LoisImg_1.jpg)..This week we conclude Chapter 8.  The comments after last week's entry were what one might expect for this dated and troubling Chapter.  *To Wives* is after all the Big Book outlier penned at the request of Bill Wilson by one of the wives of the first 100 AA "pioneers" although the editing is consistent with the rest of the Big Book.  ..Why then is it important?  Certainly the 4 categories of alcoholics in the first section usefully re-frame our thinking about alcoholism. But the value of this chapter may lie in some of the cautionary notes sounded in this concluding section that describe the road ahead from us from the perspective of spouses of recovering alcoholics.  ..And as we noted last week the whole history of the co-dependency recovery movement is built on the insights contained in this Chapter..._________________________________________.**To Wives** (P. 116-Conclusion).. If you and your husband find a solution for the pressing problem of drink you are of course going to very happy. But all problems will not be solved at once. Seed has started to sprout in a new soil but growth has only begun. In spite of your new-found happiness there will be ups and downs. Many of the old problems will still be with you. This is as it should be. .      .The faith and sincerity of both you and your husband will be put to the test. These work-outs should be regarded as part of your education for thus you will be learning to live. You will make mistakes but if you are in earnest they will not drag you down. Instead you will capitalize them. A better way of life will emerge when they are overcome. .      .Some of the snags you will encounter are irritation hurt feelings and resentments. Your husband will sometimes be unreasonable and you will want to criticize. Starting from a speck on the domestic horizon great thunderclouds of dispute may gather. These family dissensions are very dangerous especially to your husband. Often you must carry the burden of avoiding them or keeping them under control. Never forget that resentment is a deadly hazard to an alcoholic. We do not mean that you have to agree with you husband whenever there is an honest difference of opinion. Just be careful not to disagree in a resentful or critical spirit...You and your husband will find that you can dispose of serious problems easier than you can the trivial ones. Next time you and he have a heated discussion no matter what the subject it should be the privilege of either to smile and say  This is getting serious. I'm sorry I got disturbed. Let's talk about it later.  If your husband is trying to live on a spiritual basis he will also be doing everything in his power to avoid disagreement or contention. .      .Your husband knows he owes you more than sobriety. He wants to make good. Yet you must not expect too much. His ways of thinking and doing are the habits of years. Patience tolerance understanding and love are the watchwords. Show him these things in yourself and they will be reflected back to you from him. Live and let live is the rule. If you both show a willingness to remedy your own defects there will be little need to criticize each other. .      .We women carry with us a picture of the ideal man the sort of chap we would like our husbands to be. It is the most natural thing in the world once his liquor problem is solved to feel that he will now measure up to that cherished vision. The chances are he will not for like yourself he is just beginning his development. Be patient. .      .Another feeling we are very likely to entertain is one of resentment that love and loyalty could not cure our husbands of alcoholism. We do not like the thought that the contents of a book or the work of another alcoholic has accomplished in a few weeks that for which we struggled for years. At such moments we forget that alcoholism is an illness over which we could not possibly have had any power. Your husband will be the first to say it was your devotion and care which brought him to the point where he could have a spiritual experience. Without you he would have gone to pieces long ago. When resentful thoughts come try to pause and count your blessings. After all your family is reunited alcohol is no longer a problem and you and your husband are working together toward an undreamed-of future. .      .Still another difficulty is that you may become jealous of the attention he bestows on other people especially alcoholics. You have been starving for his companionship yet he spends long hours helping other men and their families. You feel he should now be yours. It will do little good if you point that out and urge more attention for yourself. We find it a real mistake to dampen his enthusiasm for alcoholic work. You should join in his efforts as much as you possibly can. We suggest that you direct some of your thought to the wives of his new alcoholic friends. They need the counsel and love of a woman who has gone through what you have. .      .It is probably true that you and your husband have been living too much alone for drinking many times isolates the wife of an alcoholic. Therefore you probably need fresh interests and a great cause to live for as much as your husband. If you cooperate rather than complain you will find that his excess enthusiasm will tone down. Both of you will awaken to a new sense of responsibility for others. You as well as your husband ought to think of what you can put into life instead of how much you can take out. Inevitably your lives will be fuller for doing so. You will lose the old life to find one much better. .      .Perhaps your husband will make a fair start on the new basis but just as things are going beautifully he dismays you be coming home drunk. If you are satisfied he really wants to get over drinking you need not be alarmed. Though it is infinitely better that he have no relapse at all as has been true with many of our men it is by no means a bad thing in some cases. Your husband will see at once that he must redouble his spiritual activities if he expects to survive. You need not remind him of his spiritual deficiency he will know of it. Cheer him up and ask him how you can be still more helpful. .      .The slightest sign of fear or intolerance may lessen your husband's chance or recovery. In a weak moment he may take your dislike of his high-stepping friends as one of those insanely trivial excuses to drink. .      .We never never try to arrange a man's life so as to shield him from temptation. The slightest disposition on your part to guide his appointment or his affairs so he will not be tempted will be noticed. Make him feel absolutely free to come and go as he likes. This is important. If he gets drunk don't blame yourself. God has either removed your husband's liquor problem or He has not. If not it had better be found out right away. Then you and your husband can get right down to fundamentals. If a repetition is to be prevented place the problem along with everything else in God's hands...We realize that we have been giving you much direct advice. We may have seemed to lecture. If that is so we are sorry for we ourselves don't always care for people who lecture us. But what we have related is base upon experience some of it painful. We had to learn these things the hard way. That is why we are anxious that you understand and that you avoid these unnecessary difficulties.* .     .So to you out there who may soon be with us we say  Good luck and God bless you!" ..      .* The fellowship of Al-Anon Family Groups was formed about thirteen years after this chapter was written. Though it is entirely separate from Alcoholics Anonymous it uses the general principles of the A.A. program as a guide for husbands wives relatives friends and others close to alcoholics. The foregoing pages (though addressed only to wives) indicate the problems such people may face. Alateen for teen-aged children of alcoholics is a part of Al-Anon.  If there is no Al-Anon listing in your local telephone book you may obtain further information on Al-Anon Family Groups by writing to its World Service Office: Box 862 Midtown Station New York NY 10018-0862._____________________________________..Questions: ..1. "[F]amily dissensions are very dangerous especially to your husband . . .[o]ften you must carry the burden of avoiding them or keeping them under control."  Is this reasonable advice to an SO in early recovery?..2. "[Y]ou may become jealous of the attention [the alcoholic] bestows on other people especially [other] alcoholics. . . [it won't do any good to] point that out and urge more attention for yourself. . . [w]e find it a real mistake to dampen his enthusiasm for alcoholic work."  What do you think about this advice to the spouse of a newly sober alcoholic?..3. "Make [the husband] feel absolutely free to come and go as he likes. This is important. If [the husband] gets drunk don't blame yourself."  Do you agree?..Wednesday: *The Family Afterwards* (one of my personal favorites)  ..[Link to prior posts introduction and disclaimer](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=big+book+study+series&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)
----------immediate responses--------

I have to comment because your post doesn't have any comments. Doing my part. ;-)..But really thanks for doing this CC. If you can reach one person with this series.... :-)
Better late than never. :)..Oh this is always a tough chapter to work through but as you note it is the foundation for the Al-Anon program. I also admire that you're committed to going through the *whole* book...I can't remember if the big book explicitly states that this chapter was written by the wife (spouse) of an alcoholic. If it doesn't it certainly should so as to help allay concerns and perceptions of conflict-of-interest. If the shoe were on the other foot and I was the non-alcoholic spouse reading this chapter I'd be tempted to say to my SO "So let me get this straight. I'm supposed to listen to advice from your alcoholic cronies. These excuses for you being out of the house all the time sound a lot like your BS lines." I'd have trust issues...It might be somewhat comforting though if it was other spouses with the same problem that offered this chapter as merely a guide. Despite its flaws and the use of outdated language the intentions were doubtless good ones. ..My wife says that most of what she learned in dealing with alcoholic me came from Al-Anon from the late 80's and early 90's. Even then she didn't agree with everything. The rest came from counselors and a lot of difficult personal experience. I'm glad she had something to turn to so as to not to feel so alone. The advice from her relatives and friends was often conflicting. I think I was naturally biased in favor of words that suggested trying to salvage the marriage but in the end that decision was my wife's and hers alone...She did not adhere so closely to the overly idealistic advice of this chapter and had every reason not to. Still somehow we survived and now even thrive. She'll probably keep me. :)
