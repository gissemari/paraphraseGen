Hey guys!! Hey guys!! [Happy Wednesday](https://davidkanigan.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/camel-caleb-wednesday-funny-hump-day-1.png?w=603&h=609)!..Let's hump it out on this happy day! Hump days are when we calibrate our sobriety check in see how our /sd buds are doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations in the format below. [And then let's all meet at the zoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a18xWp0cLHg). ..**Triumph**: I used to patronize the same few liquor stores once or twice each week. Yesterday I was walking past one with a friend who suggested we pop in for a cold soda. Of course it's all new people behind the counter and the store has been rearranged. It wasn't the same place but that makes sense -- I'm not the same person. It felt good to know that the store didn't have any power over me any more and that I didn't feel any urges or cravings being in there. I have no intention of regularly patronizing liquor stores but it's nice to know I can buy a soda in one every now and again. ..**Struggle**: I'm getting used to the regular up/down cycles of sober life. I've had a tough week and I think some of it might be related to the highs and lows of passing a year sober. I'm reminding myself that it's OK to be down sometimes and that I don't need to fix every negative emotion I have RIGHT AWAY. It's a struggle to give myself a break about it but I feel like I'm doing an OK job of it. ..**General Chat**: What's been your favorite physical manifestation of sobriety? I've heard a lot of people talk about weight loss brighter eyes and skin not to mention the pooping. I've really enjoying the feeling of being hydrated all the time. I remember waking up so goddamn thirsty. I haven't felt thirst like that in 373 days and it's pretty great. :)..More important how are you guys doing? How has this week been for you? Let us know your triumphs and struggles!
----------immediate responses--------

**Triumph:** Back to work and caught up on the brush fires and back phone calls;..**Struggle:** Social demands on my free time are kicking up my fight or flight impulses;..**General Chat:** My favorite physical manifestation of sobriety is that moment when I walk out to my porch at 5:20 AM every morning clear-headed and ready for coffee the newspaper and the potential day ahead.
**Triumph:** Gave notice at my current job this week setting things moving for switching to a job I'm super excited about in a couple weeks. Beyond the new-job-smell it's meaningful to me because I had to turn down a similar opportunity I really wanted a couple years ago because I couldn't stop drinking and I knew it wouldn't work. It's taken time to get back there but I'm really grateful I got there again at all...**Struggle:** Over the last couple weeks I seem to have forgotten that getting sober doesn't mean being happy or stress-free. I've probably gotten a little too lax in exercising the mental sanity muscles lately so I think I'll do some reading/practice this week...**General Chat**: Favorite physical manifestation? Hmm... hydration is definitely good - I used to bring a 2L nalgene to bed every night. Water never tasted so good at 4am. But probably weight loss and getting back into running for me. I've been able to go on some pretty amazing adventures with friends as a result of not being perma-hungover and out of shape.
[May hump day not be dry in your neck of the woods.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoMDMrxkx74)
**Triumph**: I made it to 7 days!  I haven't been here in over a year and it feels SO awesome.  I can't wait to be in the double digits again.  I'm so close I can almost taste it..**Struggle**: The more days I accumulate in sobriety the more I can hear the voice that says "see! you don't have a problem! go have a beer it's okay."  I'm getting good at acknowledging those thoughts letting them be and focusing my attention somewhere else because really I have more important things to do. :).**General Chat**: My favorite physical manifestation - my skin is clearing up already!  My face does not look red and blotchy anymore and is much more brighter.  I'm maintaining hydration which makes exercising so much easier.  I also really enjoy waking up in the morning feeling well rested and not so much like a bag of shit with regret and shame.  This look is good for me!
**Triumph** I only have two more meetings (Friday and Sunday) where I have to identify myself as being in my first 90 days of sobriety to go! Holy crap! ..**Struggle** When it rains it pours I feel like so many things are going wrong in my life  I didn't get the promotion I really should have got  there's a fairly good chance my husband and I are going to decide to split up  the thought of splitting assets/moving/who gets the dog makes me cry at least once a day I just realised a non refundable plane ticket I booked to the other side of the world to see my parents in October overlaps when I'm going to be in the wedding party for one of my best friends. Now need to hopefully get some sympathy from American Airlines but likely forfeit $800 and not get to spend time with my parents which I really really need.. (Another triumph is that I'm not using my life falling apart as an excuse to relapse) ..**General Chat** I wouldn't change it for anything  but I feel like recovery has ruined drinking for me. I kind of *want to want to* drink but when I even consider it I know it won't help any problems and relapsing will just make a bad situation a tragedy.  Don't get me wrong  it's really amazing that I don't want to drink over my problems  I kind of miss having an easy way to turn my brain off temporarily. 
**Triumph:** Still sober for the 25th morning in a row. Fuck yeah!..**Struggle:** Getting sloppy maintaining the discipline to keep things straight in my head. I really need to make a set schedule for doing those things especially in the afternoon. My body seems to be falling apart and I can barely exercise which is really getting my down. Must have faith it will get better...**General Chat:** It has been a really bumpy ride as of late. However even when I lack sleep and feel groggy I am still doing so much better. I didn't really appreciate how detrimental excessive drinking is to my cognitive functioning - and thinking is my bread and butter. 
**Triumph**: I have been checking in at this sub every morning and throughout the day.  It has helped me to make that daily commitment to myself and sobriety.  I start each day with gratitude and I am truly enjoying the bulk of my journey...**Struggle**:  I am visiting the divorce lawyer this morning to get that ball rolling and I have some sadness around that.  Boredom has hit too but I made a list of solutions and have been working on it.  ..**General Chat**:  I have 2 physical manifestations that make me happy.  First is that I woke up at 7am today without an alarm and got coffee and got my day started.  Second is that without drinking I can actually follow the nutrition plan I have been working on for over a year.
**Triumph** I made it past 2 weeks this is where I previously failed so yay! Physically I feel pretty great especially in the mornings. Nothing better then sitting on my patio on an early weekend morning sipping coffee and watching the birds and squirrels doing their thing...**Struggle** Mentally I've been not so good. I knew when I decided to stop drinking there were some underlying emotions that I was going to need to deal with. I didn't realize it was going to be so hard. At some points it's almost crushing and my preferred way of dealing with it by not dealing with it at all is no longer an option. Time to find some new solutions...**General Chat**  Physical manifestation... weight loss and reducing blood pressure are definite bonuses for me. 
Struggle: there's no food in the house except for the dog and the internet is shut off...Triumph: despite those setbacks I'm not going to drink today!
**Triumph:** My desk at home is in the basement "The Man Cave". That's where I drank and escaped from reality. I spend a lot less time there now. Except when I work from home. Lately I'm working from home a lot less. Being around people and not hiding and acting like a "normal" person. ..**Struggle:** I have a very low tolerance for bullshit lately. Drunk me would just say "Whatever". Sober me is often thinking "Idiot" or actually calling out the bullshit. I see this as a manifestation of having a spine and self worth again but I also know I need to temper this.  Growing pains? ..**General Chat:** This morning I'm sitting here at the office and thinking "God damn it's a great day!" and "This coffee is so fucking good!"  Basically I'm just loving the mornings and feeling great. That's my favorite physical manifestation even though I have lost a ton of beer gut.  
**Triumph**: I've been going through some tough relationship stuff.  In the past though my concerns were not heard because anything and everything could be blamed on my drinking.  But now I'm heard.  My point of view is no longer dismissed.  It's still tough managing through these people issues but when you see the light at the end of the tunnel it's so rewarding...**Struggle**: I guess the above was not exactly a triumph or a struggle...**General Chat**: I'm sure it's related to weight loss but definitely it's the reduced sweating.  Before it would be the middle of January.  Everyone else is wearing sweaters and are still cold.  I'm wearing short sleeve shirts and am still sweating.  On Friday I had to go to an event where business attire (suits) were required.  Friday was hot.  And humid.  And there I am in a suit driving with my windows down mingling with the other people (who were wiping sweat from their brows) cool as a cucumber.  I love being fit and not sweating all the time.
**Triumph**: I made it 18 days without drinking. I have a cool sponsor who digs the same music as me and is an overall good guy. The aforementioned cool-dude sponsor has introduced me to several like-minded fellas in my area so it is nice to have a good support group. .**Struggle**: I had such a great Friday and Saturday night last weekend (100% sober) but I had some very low lows as I entered back into the work week. My attitude was piss poor from Sunday night through this morning but I'm feeling much better today. .**General Chat**: I haven't really changed physically yet. I still weigh the same and still go to the gym about the same amount. I eat WAY too much at night now as I'm not getting calories from a dozen IPA's and various other beers a night. I am sleeping WAY better now though. When I would drink I would usually wake up to pee in the middle of the night then I'd get anxious and my mind would start trying to catch up on what happened in the past or what was going to happen at work in the morning. Now I sleep all night long and have lots of dreams. I love dreams. 
**Triumph:** Things are good sobriety wise. Things are pretty good life wise too!..**Struggle:** Both my sons and I have colds. I don't feel bad enough to not work on time-sensitive projects but I don't feel good. Neither do they...**Chat:** For me weight-loss was a prelude to fitness. I feel much happier in my body nowadays.
**Triumph:** I had a coming out of sorts with my boss and a few close friends from work as well as long time friends and family.  It is an incredible weight off of my shoulders!  I finally feel that I have made myself accountable and grown up over the past week.  I feel like a complete human being and am more determined than ever to continue with my sobriety.  Additionally I've returned to training very hard for my first marathon I'm running in November.  This past week has not been easy but with my outpatient treatment and AA meetings on the weekend I feel extremely capable of staying on the path...**Struggle:**  I'm lonely.  Plain and simple.  Not lonely for a friend because I have friends I can count on but lonely for affection.  I realize that this is not an ideal time for a relationship but it's still very difficult to shake the desire to have a companion I can share my life with.  I have been thinking a lot about my previous relationship and particularly feeling remorse for the way I treated her and the way that it ended.  Still taking it day by day and filling my life with activities has helped keep my mind focused solely on this.  Nighttime right before bed is the only time this feeling truly comes to the surface.  ..**General Chat:**  Man I can list so many things!  First of all just the clarity and confidence that has come pouring back over the past couple days.  All of my problems which seemed insurmountable all of a sudden seem challenging but ultimately manageable.  My body has responded in dramatic fashion as well.  I have gotten back into a rigorous combination of climbing running and hiking and I feel like the sky is the limit!  I look forward to seeing what happens next!.  
has been a pretty negative few days - took the day off work yesterday because I wanted too - did laundry shopping typical stuff

**Triumph**: The world seems less overwhelming. I'd been living in a state of constant panic for so long that I'd forgotten what it was like to not do that. I mean the things that used to send me into absolute despair take like five minutes to do and I just never had the mental strength to get through even that...**Struggle**: Reminding myself that emotions are normal. I'm emotionally stunted anyway (as my therapist once memorably described it I'm an "emotional tightass") and I used booze to completely drown it out. Blackout was the entire goal; if I remembered everything the next day I considered it a failure. Now I'm having a somewhat greater range of emotions and though I've learned how to cope with them my initial response is to run the hell away from them however I possibly can. Fighting that is kind of hard since it's been my default for so long...**General Chat**: I'm very pleased with the weight loss and not sweating and feeling gross all the time. But the prize has to go to a comment my dad made when I saw him a couple weeks ago and told him I'd quit drinking. He was massively relieved (as I'd expected) and said "I didn't want to say anything before but the last time I saw you you looked *bad*. Your skin was actually gray. I've been really worried." The fact that it's visible from the outside? I guess that's a change I can't deny.
Triumph: made it through the wedding of two of my for college friends this weekend and wrapping up a beach vacation with my girlfriend's family through today. Feeling quite refreshed. ..Struggle: Work couldn't keep its shit together while I was away. Not looking forward to going back tomorrow and catching up on my backlog of crap. ..General Chat: 28 days is a new record for me. Feels pretty damn good. ..
**Triumph:** I finally found a hobby I enjoy.  I was going through all my old hobbies trying new hobbies and still getting really upset at my addict brain who had decided alcohol and drugs were the only ways to have fun.  I went swing dancing a few nights ago something I have not done in at least four years and oh my god I had so much fun.  I forgot how much I love dancing!..**Struggle:**Still not moving forward (or backwards) with work career educational goals.  I m not happy where I am but I don't know how to muster up the motivation or self discipline to move forward...**GC:** I have not lost weight my skin looks the same I still feel dehydrated often despite the copious amounts of water I drink but.... at least I don't feel like shit most mornings.  I wake up and I usually want to get out of bed.
**Triumph:** I'm actually a day away from a year sobriety. ..**Struggle:** I have one of my first job interviews in over fifteen years and I'm nervous though thrilled I got a call back...**General Chat:** My favorite manifestation of my sobriety is that my daughter is talking to me again. No unrealistic expectations but I'm happy it's that way today.  
**Triumph:**  The sheer joy of waking up sober having a clear mind knowing that every decision I make-whether it's right or wrong-is my own and not a product of a chemically altered brain...**Struggle:** My son is a homeless alcoholic who got out of detox for the nth time 5 days ago. Started drinking immediately. Arranged for a ride to go to a program and didn't show up. Feel bad that I can't help him I gave him the gene and think he doesn't have long for this earth...**General Chat:** Noticing that my skin is icky breakouts anyone? But my eyes are clearer and my belly is a little flatter :)
