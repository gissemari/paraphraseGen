Hi all. Sorry my flair is wrong - I recently relapsed and and am now at 17 completed days...I wanted to share a little analogy that kinda helps me. I like to play video games so I started thinking of my sober days as sort of a "high score." The game is "easy." Just don't drink and watch those points rack up! (Easier said than done I know). If I pick up a drink it's "game over" and I have to start again at zero...Anyway how this resonates with a few of you. I'm amazed at this community and how supportive everyone is. Let's keep it up and I DEFINITELY will not be drinking with any of you today...Thanks!

Great analogy. I also like to think of big events I make it through for the first time without booze as "achievements unlocked." Concerts weddings holidays parties etc. Any activity where I would have gotten wasted before... 
I love analogies.  Yours is a good one easy to understand and directly applicable!..No drinks for me today either.  Game not over!
