I want to encourage everyone who may be struggling. I know I don't have all the answers and yet bloody hell I managed a year. instead of trying to write something profound I will share a few journal entries...A little background. I quit my job to start a business in 2014 I had not been happy or fulfilled and sometimes came home and drank away my frustration. Early in 2015 I was panicking that I would have to give up or go back to being miserable. ..**8 January 2015**.I have been feeling unhappy worrying I am on the wrong path what will I do if I can't make this work?  I'm not making any money. I am not going back there. ...I have been feeling pretty depressed nothing is exciting me. I feel like running away...**21 January 2015**.Day 10 of not drinking finally getting energy back and feeling good. Rethinking the 21 day thing the more I read the stop drinking sub the more I think I'm ready to say goodbye to alcohol for good. I can't think of many positives it brings to my life. If I could have 1 or 2 that would be fine but even 3 leaves me crappy out of control and useless the next day. Also I do and say things I don't want to. Have been a regular drinker for so long I worry what people will think of me..The one day at a time is helpful because it is not saying I will never drink again just not today getting focussed on business and feeling good. ..Been eating junk I don't care one thing at a time. Been running and did a 16 mile bike ride. I'm on the up...It's gonna be ok...Grateful...Love life again...**6 January 2016**.In less than a week it will be a year since I stopped drinking. I can hardly believe it there was a time when I felt I would never do it and didn't want to. I wanted to continue to 'enjoy' drinking but not the hangoversarguments the feeling of dread and shame of what I said or did. Now I know that having a drink doesn't make things better it is conditioning I was led to believe it made life fun. I am doing better with business more proactive grateful focussed happy. I don't need to drink. I toyed with idea of moderation it doesn't seem worth the bother. I am grateful for...(a long list that included SD)..Thank you everyone here for your encouragement posts comments and honesty especially the moderators for your incredible hard work...My phone just played Happy Birthday. I had created a reminder called Amazing Day it truly is!..TL/DR I did a year so can you things got better. Thanks SD....
