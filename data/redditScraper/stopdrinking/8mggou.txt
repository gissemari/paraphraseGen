So as the headline explains I attempted sobriety last year \(roughly the same time\) and made it approximately four months before falling off of the wagon during a overnight motorcycle trip.  This was followed by a year of heavy sometimes typical binge drinking.  Well after two close calls \(no DUIs but it would have been right around the corner\) I made the decision to wise up again and jump back on the wagon.  This time it's not an "I'm quitting for life."; it's an "I'm quitting one day at a time."        ..Well my best friend and riding brother had been trying to call and talk to me for a few days but since I work nights in the E.R. and he's on days it was a misfire every time.  Plus given the fact that I'm usually pulling six fifteen hour shifts a week it's hard to do anything but arrive home and sleep.  \(Additionally it's been preventing me from having the time to drink.\)      ..I finally made contact and he basically stated that his health had been horrible the last few months eventually landing him in the E.R. and it was all due to his drinking.  \(He estimated around a fifth a day.\)  Since he lives in Kalamazoo \(beautiful town for Craft Breweries\) we always went out when I visited and there was always alcohol fully stocked in the house.        He wanted to wait to share this with me until he was a month sober \(he feels that it's completely turned his life around\) and all I could respond with was "Well...I have something to tell you as well."  I was two days sober second attempt at this point.      ..So I offered some tips and observations from my previous attempt and he's been attending meetings three or four times a week in addition to mountain biking and healthy eating.  We also try to at least text "IWNDWYT" once a day for confirmation and reinforcement.      I feel like we'll be far closer friends now that we are both experiencing such an impactful event together and are more supportive jointly.      ..Also Craig Ferguson has a monologue from Youtube \(search for "Straight from the Heart"\) that also resonates with me.  I watch it when I need a little boost.

I'm so glad you're here with us and that you're using your available support systems.  One week one day at a time. Come back to let us know how it's going!
Glad you're here...There's one of Craig's interviews with Robin Williams where they talk about sobriety for a while. It's great if you like their humor.
