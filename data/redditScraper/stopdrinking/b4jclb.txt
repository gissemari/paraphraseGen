I'm feeling as though I might need a pick me up from SD today...Promised myself a bit ago to surrender and to stop putting so much significance on finding "the one". But sometimes that human need for companionship creeps in and I log into dating apps. I realize now that it's in those times that I need to seek connection with the phenomenal groups I'm a part of; play my instrument or hit the gym where where are other people around me...&amp;#x200B;..**Has my "need" for dating an attempt to fill the void for where alcohol had been?** I'm not sure. It's all linked to connection ....isn't it. I think that need had been there long before. I know that in AA they say to wait one year before dating. I do not attend the meetings but I have in the past. I've never spoken at them (perhaps should). It never resonated with me but I'm so glad it exists and I see its impact. I will likely attend at my year mark for a chip (and I hope that that's okay)..  .So here's where my post gets to the meat of it so thanks for slogging through this motley read and bearing with me:..I went on a date with someone who was absolutely the bees knees. We both had a wonderful time I could tell that she was also very much into me (and wanted to kiss ME at the end of the night but I don't do first date kisses). She has almost a decade of sobriety. Amazing. We met didn't speak of sobriety prior to the date. She mentioned a couple days later that she cannot date someone who at the early part of their sobriety and not past the year mark. There are roughly 50 or so days til my year...&amp;#x200B;..Is there something I'm missing about AA and rules. Is this a personal decision or a hard fast rule?  ...This gutted me a bit but I'm OK. My spirit is saying "it's okay it's okay it's okay". It's like I was dismissed for a calendar year. **Are we not much more than that?** I do understand having had gone through all of the very significant dates and trials of sobriety during the 12 months. My year is coming not that it's not significant for me but I've began to place more significance on my having grown my constant evolving and ever learning how to truly and unapologetically love myself and others in this world. And to be a good man. AA isn't the path for everyone. Should it not be about how we believe and/or live our lives rather than what we believe or what sect or group we belong to.  ...*In one year I've become a runner (at 40) and love it.*..*I'm about to adopt a pup this weekend :3* ..*Work is going well and I love my career. Living alone in the city financially stable with savings and the ability to give &amp; be generous. New friendships that I'm learning to fully give/be myself within.*..*In therapy for about a year -- which has been huge.*..*My fears have been diminishing as I've invited them to the table to co-create with me instead of being angry that they were present (what is it here to teach me? treating it like a child that needs attention these days).*..Things aren't 100% amazing all the time but as I list it out here (gosh) things are good. ..Night and day from a year ago...  .I want to say to SDers who are struggling - stick with it. The vicissitudes I found were a part of life this was just one entity. I'm happy to be part of the many who are waking up to what alcohol is...&amp;#x200B;..I just wanted to let this out say a prayer for me if you so wish -- or whatever you do (good energy?) It helped writing this out on a blustery day here on the East coast. Maybe the rejection was a blessing in some disguise.   ...Much love to you all and I will not drink with you today.  ...tldr: feeling low first date that went incredibly well ended up to be a let down because I'm 51 days shy of a year in sobriety for someone who is a decade into hers. realizing it's okay. thanks to SD for being in existence.

It's a "rule" that I see broken all the freaking time. Sometimes it's a disaster but that's often two very new people hooking up and sometimes I've seen it not be a big deal. I also know a guy who waited for hour one of day 366 to ask out a woman who is now his wife...I think that if you're feeling strong and not just latching onto the first person to float past because you're feeling lost then go for it and good luck!..&amp;#x200B;
That must be her personal choice I do not know I am not in AA. .. In the movie "28 Days" with Sandra Bullock and a cast of great actors  the head of the rehab program when asked when could they (the people in rehab) could start dating.   He says something like ..."get a plant and after a year if it is alive get a pet and if that is still alive after a year then you could start to think about dating."  Of course the character gets a plant and dog soon after release.   ..Tell her you will see her in 51 one days to celebrate with non alcoholic beverages!..IWNDWYT 
As it's been explained to me people with under a year of sobriety are not recommended to start new relationships (or end existing ones I think?) because they should be focusing on living sober and it's not a good time to make big life decisions. Not everyone follows this mind you. ..I know what you mean about feeling like just a number. For a while I didn't want to count the days because I felt like it made me nervous that I was going to lose them or something I don't know. When I told someone this casually at a meeting it was as if I had just whipped out a flask and started drinking! Sometimes people are really rigid and set in their ways...Long story short it's just a recommendation. But people take them really seriously because it's a serious disease... sometimes I have to be reminded that alcoholism kills people. It's truly life or death!
We all have our own weird little coping rules you just ran into one of someone else's rules that's all. It's nothing personal but maybe someone this inflexible has tiny little control issues in other areas that you wouldn't have liked? Maybe all her pencils have to be lined up the same way in the kitchen drawer? Maybe all the recycling items have to be lined up according to size and category? You never know when rejection is actually a near miss of something not so great. Keep on running in the right direction and you'll run into a kindred spirit one day.
