Hello SD...Today marks a whole month since I stopped drinking an achievement if you will...But I'm struggling more than ever before. My moods have been so up and down the last few days. I finally saw a therapist on Friday for an assessment session but won't begin counselling until the new year.  I think I have some base- level anxiety but now I can't even tell anymore...I go from 0-90 in seconds. My boyfriend who is one of the only people aware of my current anxiety gets verbal abuse from me constantly and I hate the way I act with him...Today has gone from worse to worse - I woke to find my fridge unplugged and  20 worth of food ruined. Money is so tight at the moment this ruined my day. I slept for two hours in the afternoon because I couldn't cope and eventually called my parents for a pick-me-up. They told me when I go home for Christmas my gran is taking my room and I will have an air bed for four days...It's all such trivial things but I am struggling so badly to cope right now. I just need to reach out cause today is not a good day for me.

Take 5-HTP. I know you can get it in a nutrition store in the US and amazon.com. It REALLY improves my mood. I understand what you mean exactly when you described your mood and how little things set it off. It makes me stabile and works within a couple of days. 
The roller coaster is really tough.  I know how you feel.  Take plenty of time to rest and know that it will get better.  ..We have to learn how to cope with our emotions when we stop medicating with booze.  ..Be proud of 30 days.  It is a big deal!
I hear you. Since quitting I have discovered that the only 2 things I know to do when I feel bad are cry or drink and I took drinking off the table. I'm trying to breathe and meditate and let go when I get emotionally overwhelmed. I'll let you know if it starts working.
