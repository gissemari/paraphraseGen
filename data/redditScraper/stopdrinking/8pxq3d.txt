So I somehow got a new job and its been three weeks and going pretty well I'm enjoying myself mostly. But like emotionally I've been all over the place quite depressed and lonely. A fucking roller coaster and I've realised that's not really sustainable. and it's mostly due to drinking. and now I only have weekends to really get toasted I just drink friday and saturday night and it's a fucking waste of a weekend...I've said this to myself many times but fuck it i will try again. One day at a time! Gonna try post here a bit more too just so I'm focused and am less likely to relapse. so yeah. hi.

You can do it!
Keep pushing you can make it happen one minute at a time.
Glad you are here. Starting a new job can be awkward and weird. It's great once you get into your stride. Best of luck.
