I saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/2bh98e/617_days_holy_crap_does_time_fly_or_what/) I made two years ago on /r/stopsmoking that makes me cringe as I read it today...Basically I was telling people there that I was free of smoking for 600+ days and they could do it too while at the same time telling them that I took a stick occasionally while drinking...It sounds arrogant but in my defense I know I meant well. I truly believed that I had the habit 'beat'. ..However today I am at 21 days smoke-free and 27 days drink-free and I know that I am an addict and the addict inside me will always want another puff or a sip. Just a puff or a sip and it's a slippery slope that gets faster and faster. Quitting has to be complete and for life or it does not work for me...That experience was painful but I'm thankful for that humbling experience now. ..I know the road ahead is long and I might not 'arrive' at any particular destination so I just have to enjoy and be thankful for each day of being free from my addictions.

Yay thank you --- I sometimes have crushing denial. This post gives me hope of extending the periods of less denial for longer.
