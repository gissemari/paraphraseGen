Ugh. I'm not particularly upset because I didn't get drunk...it's just the beer triggers me to do other bad behavior. I have an eating disorder...bulimia nervousa. I haven't drank in a long time to get drunk just to throw up. It's disgusting. ..I also got high last night (weed is NOT good for my brain at all) and took a bath. The water seemed to become cold after 5 minutes. Thoughts of just staying in there and freezing to death crossed my mind...but my stoned brain is stupid because I live at home with my mom basically a woman child. ..I had therapy yesterday before all this and I was fine. I got a lot off my chest about my most recent heartbreak. I can't get over this guy. I've dated other people I've slept with other people...I just can't get him out of my head. We jump at the same dropzone (skydiving) and I think I may just have to move to a different state. I've never had this much trouble getting over someone. I've never loved someone so much for 3 years. I've been hearing the whole "you'll find someone someday!" shit for 10 years. No one can predict the future. If you look at my post history I'm basically every guy's worst nightmare. ..Anyways...back to square one. I will not drink with you today!

At least goad you came back. ..IWNDWYT 
 That's front page worthy shit!!
I know that for me a lot of my regrettable embarrassing or self-destructive behavior comes from the core issue of drinking.  I believe that drinking is the cause not a symptom of most of my mental issues.  I can write a laundry list of ways that I wish I could fix or get over things but I think that drinking is at the core of the issue for me.  Stopping drinking is priority one I believe everything else will follow suit (or at least be manageable) if I can accomplish that.  IWNDWYT.
