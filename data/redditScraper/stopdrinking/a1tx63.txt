Hi there. Firstly I am sorry for the longer post but thank you in advance for reading it and offering any possible advice/support &lt;3..So some background: I have been dabbling with sobriety for the last few years a sober October here a month off there. But it has been in the last year (post DV relationship) that I have realised that I need and want to get sober. Since then it's been an on and off again journey. However in the last 6 months I've been in a period of transition I have really been struggling to get on top of. I was an Aussie living in Canada and 6 months ago left my main city (where I've been based for years) to move across the country for a few months before heading back to Australia for good/foreseeable future. This ended up with me in a lot of goodbye parties/farewells with friends which resulted in me falling off the wagon. After that I was trying to get sober again before coming home to Aus. However I relapsed again. And finally I landed in Australia. I thought once I was set up at this home base (new city) living with my best friend again I'd be ok. She is a drinker though (supportive albeit skeptical of my trying to maintain sobriety) and that paired with trying to make new friends and feeling like the quiet girl of the party I haven't been able to maintain being sober for any long stretch of time. I guess to be fair I have only been back a few weeks but I am just feeling very weak and disappointed in myself right now...I know the reasons why I want to stop. I'm not a rock bottom drinker but would probably assign myself a high functioning alcoholic label. I don't drink to the ruin of my life but it chips away at everything in innocuous little ways and once I start I find myself looking for ways to continue. Whatever the case I want to be sober. I am just having a very difficult time holding onto it for enough time to have that discipline snow ball...I am living in a small coastal city at the moment and can't make regular AA meeting due to my shift work job. Does anyone have information about online sponsors or groups? I wonder if that may be of some help ..Thank you for reading! I am viewing December as a fresh start and want to bring in 2019 sober and ready to take on a clean year ahead.

For some people there is a glass bottom.  Meaning we don't hit rock bottom but a glass where we can see what rock bottom would look like.  It doesn't mean that you don't have an issue.  It just means that not everyone can see your issue...You are in the right place to start!  Read some SD.  There are some books/videos marked on the side pannel.  This Naked Mind was a game changer for me along with light journaling.  ..Breathe.  You are a good person and you deserve to have a good life.  IWNDWYT.
Well you have found your way to a online group that can really help you.  Instead of wondering if it might help you could get a badge and commit to not drinking starting today.  Read the success stories on this sub. Do the daily check in. I will not drink with you today.  
&gt;probably assign myself a high functioning alcoholic label..There's that 'F' word we're all so fond of!..'Functioning' tends to be a *stage* not a type... [The Myth Of The Functioning Alcoholic](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/45bndo/the_myth_of_the_functioning_alcoholic/) is a very useful read in this regard... We're all 'functional' until we aren't due to the progressive nature of the condition.....I found the book 'Alcohol Explained' and the book/YouTube 'This Naked Mind' really helpful for understanding my drinking problem and permanently changing the way I view alcohol - they are well worth a look and made all the difference for me in stopping for good without feeling like I was missing anything or depriving myself.....I've used this sub as my only support group and it's worked for me!..There is also tons of material about addiction and recovery on YouTube countless blogs ('Mrs D Is Going Without' is very good) podcasts like 'Recovery Elevator' and 'Dharma Punx' loads of [Quit Lit](https://old.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/books) etc to start getting yourself into the Recovery Mindset... ..If you make a point of reading/listening/watching a little something recovery-related every day and pop on here every day it all adds up and starts to rewire your boozy thinking.....Best of luck and keep us posted!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
