I recently had to. I started on here about a month ago got 14 days. Relapse. Got 7 days. Relapse. Back at day 3...I feel much much better than I did at 3 days the first time. That time sober wasn't wasted. It was still my body healing coping better and bouncing back...The last time I relapsed it was hard and for a days. The first two days were hellish withdrawal. But don't be disheartened. I feel stronger now and you will too...I can't get the money and time back I wasted but I'm only human.

Thank you for posting this.
Every relapse was you learning more about how to handle the next attempt at sobriety. I would tell you to just keep fighting but you're already doing that so... O'Doyle rules! ..Seriously though I'm glad that you're making good decisions. We can all do this if we keep telling ourselves one day at a time. I'll gladly not drink with you today.
It's good practice for the never ending jailbreak :)

I'm right there with you
Day 3 here hard to reset after almost 5 months but those are MY rules....Here's to not drinking !
Yes! This is how I feel too. I had 108 days until last week's relapse. It felt like such a setback because I was doing so well. But I still did a lot of personal growing during that time that is helping me now. 
Hey Cobra - glad you picked yourself right back up....good to have you back friend :)
When I quit smoking it was this back and forth for a while. ..I think by quitting over and over you do start to get used to the idea that it is happening and possible to do. 3 days or 300 you are starting to get an indication of an alcohol free life into your head...I have a feeling I'm going to be a badge resetter for some time to come unfortunately.....
