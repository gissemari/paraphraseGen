Day 51: kitten did not imbibe. Did my morning mantra I am an alcoholic I will not drink today but I love myself and I'm working a solution. ..Lots has been on my mind the last few days about my sobriety. I've heard some people talk about relapse in meetings and on here. I've wondered if I'll relapse. I don't want to. I didn't go to a meeting for almost two weeks. Towards the end of that time I  was white knuckling it like a mofo not to drink. I was sitting in my apartment *waiting* for the day to end and go to sleep just so I wouldn't drink. That was awful. Going back to my home group today was good but kinda hard in a weird way. I thought maybe they thought I relapsed. I know that they'd welcome me back no matter what though and that was comforting. But by me just thinking it was kinda hard to go back after not going for a few meetings helped me understand how hard it would be to go back after a relapse. And how awful I would feel. That feeling might actually be worse than how I felt the last time I drank...and I don't ever want to feel like that again or know anything deeper. Someone said one of the worst feelings an alcoholic can have is to have a head full of AA and a belly full of booze. We had the tools but somehow just didn't use them. I haven't relapsed but somehow I can understand that. I don't want to relapse...To those who have relapsed and keep trying I think you are amazing people.  I think it means that you love yourself (or others) enough to keep trying. You have my admiration. ..I also loved today's meeting because it was step two: we came to believe that a power greater than ourselves can restore us to sanity. Most of use think that is God I know I did especially before I went to AA. I'm not a religious person. The God I knew growing up I resented and hated him. I hated that God because I saw all the bad things I felt God did in my life to not just me but to my family and friends and I hated him for it. And my brain saw all those things in the aggregate. One big giant cluster fuck courtesy of God. ..What AA taught me wasn't *that* God it was god = good orderly direction. And I can get down with that. That I just have to follow a good orderly direction and that will keep me sober. Resenting the other God that prevented me from seeing the woods for the trees. All I saw was the woods and the fear in them I just saw the bad. Seeing only the woods as a whole prevented me from seeing that my entire life I was constantly being pushed in a good direction except I didn't listen. I couldn't see the amazing good in my life because I was always focusing in the direction of the amazingly bad. I couldn't see the beauty in the trees because I kept looking at the darkness the woods as a whole cast. ..I see that beauty now in the people who share with me in AA and in the things in my life. I've gotten extremely lucky/blessed in life because while I was going against that good direction I still managed to not completely fuck myself up. I'm still here. Even though I wasn't listening somehow I still ended up with good stuffs. I can only imagine what can happen if I actually listen. ..I'll still fight the good orderly direction I know that. I'll fight it because it's in my nature both as an alcoholic and just because of my personality. I still think I can fix myself but I tried that route for 12 years it didn't work for me. But there will be the other parts of AA to help me to listen to that good orderly direction when I fight it and it'll stop the war I wage inside of myself everyday. (Or at least call a cease fire for the day lol) I don't want to fight me anymore I want to love me. ..Thanks for reading that wall-o-text fellow SD'ers and sobies I appreciate it. Stay safe out there and have a good night. Kitten out.

Great insight kitten. I enjoy your daily posts because they're so honest. I relapsed in AA several times before I maintained sobriety. Going back sucked worse every time. I finally worked the steps and completely lost interest in drinking. Have a good night!
I just want to say thank u for sharing. And thank u for ur daily posts. I'm sure it helps you by getting things off ur chest that u just can't tell anyone but it helps us immensely as well. A fresh insight a new occurrence an unfamiliar feeling a familiar feeling. Whatever it is for me it helps me grow. It's much like being in a meeting ya? Congrats on ur recovery! Only a few away from 60. You're doing well and allowing yourself to feel feelings. Good bad happy sad. Thank you for inspiring me! &lt;3 waitress
