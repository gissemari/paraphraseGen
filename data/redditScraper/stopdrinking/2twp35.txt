So i relapsed hardcore 5 days ago. I was hospitalized and finally I knew just trying to go to AA by myself wasn't enough. It was time for a new tactic. ..I decided to stop living alone and move in with 3 of my close sober friends who I knew could keep me accountable. Now I'm 6 days sober moved in going to a new AA meeting that is insanely better and alcohol hasn't even crossed my mind. I know it will but this was the best idea. Living alone in sobriety is a horrible idea. I know if I fail though after this attempt its time for rehab. I'm sticking to that and I can feel this was a great idea. ..Sobriety can't be done alone. I know that now. So thank you everyone for being here. Upwards and onwards.

This sounds like a great idea
I respect you taking action like you are. It's so easy to rely on feelings or intentions but those come and go. Actions like this even if not fun are how we change ourselves. I want to read some updates soon! :)
&gt;Sobriety can't be done alone. I know that now. ..And it's so much easier and more fun with help! Congrats on making a positive change and moving forward!..
Most people would find it strange but I imagine everyone here might understand when I say that some of my best moments were when I lived in a half way house.  Living around like minded people with the same goals is an amazing opportunity to have.  I unfortunately don't have that luxury and I do live alone but I find this place helps me a lot.  I also have very supportive friends at work that understand my situation.  So I may not have someone to share my home with but I am certainly not doing it alone and I couldn't agree more with you.
