Title basically says it all.  I'm getting lots of commands from the alcoholic brain that are arguing for a once a month relapse.  It would be fun.  Yes.  But let's be realistic here alcoholic brain.  It wouldn't be once a month.

For me I'd drink one day a month until the next day and then I'd be at 2 days...and I doubt I'd stop.  I've tried it before heh and well...here I am back at less than 2 weeks sober...You know yourself and you know the alcoholic in you.  I hope it all works out for you whatever you decide.
I always looked for reasons or qualifiers when I was sober to have a drink (or 20) now I am here at what I hope is my last bottom. It is never "once a month" for me. Happy birthday to you an easy date to say "I haven't drank since..." My day is Good Friday. 
/u/greatmainewoods I think you're talking sense to your alcoholic brain.  Lots of people I know in recovery call this--playing the tape all the way through.  
It's a great sign that you can be honest enough with yourself to acknowledge that - happy birthday!
My alcoholic brain wants booze more than once a month. It tells me just one to celebrate because it knows me. ..But I know it too. I'm on to you alcoholic brain and I ain't takin' none of yo shit.
