So on a recommendation to journal every day and note triggers.  Yesterday (relapse) I was on day 6 and overwhelmed with the urge to drink.  I don't know where it came from or why.  I caved.  Since then I've read about Urge Surfing and will try that technique next time.  I will also take a naltrexone...Today I'm recovering from the hangover and have 0 urge to drink.  I felt so ill today. It's always like this today is an easy day to be firm about it to experience the hangover pain and say 'never again'.  Not a single craving all day even the thought of having to get in the car and drive anywhere sounds bad.  But I know I'll feel better tomorrow and it won't seem as bad.  The cravings will start to get really loud on around day 3 and then get louder and more insistent with every day after.  Day 5-14 are the danger days for me.  Either someone will invite me out or dopamine is at a low point or I'm just really susceptible to triggers on those days. Not sure.  I remember the last time I was sober for several months that I had reminded myself that the cravings peak and then they drop off.  Like I think I said it was at week 2 or 3 that they were at a crescendo and then they weren't as bad after.  I really do want to go several weeks without drinking I remember I had some weird effects the last time I was sober for a few months like emotional numbness which was apparently my brain trying to sort out dopamine and ramp up production.  Maybe I do and I don't maybe I'm still iffy and not 100% committed internally to being 100% sober like I'm still telling myself I can moderate eventually.  Even though nearly every moderating attempt always ends like this waking up feeling shitty and drinking the whole bottle.    I want to experience what the long termers do when their brain completely readjusts their dopamine production and they feel emotions listening to music again.  I hardly feel anything anymore.    Fortunately I've quit cigarettes and it is such a wonderful feeling to not have cravings for cigarettes anymore to have gotten over that hump without giving in the cravings eventually disappeared and now I'm free of that curse.  Could alcohol be like that too? I'm so tired I'm disappointed in myself just want to sleep.

Around day 14 after you had your last drink the body is not affected anymore by the processes of drinking alcohol. These 14 days are the most common days for people to relapse. The body craves for alcohol because you are still in the process of detoxification. There are several tricks to keep up your sobriety in critical situations (when you feel like you HAVE to go get a drink and almost feel a physical force trying to get you to drink). Tricking your body works different for everyone so you have to try a few things and look what works the best for you. Common methods are:..Eating lemon or sour candy.Eating spicy.Exercising.Cold shower.Drinking alot of water/tea.Taking a walk.Call a good friend and talk about your situation..Basically anything you can think of to leave the situation you are in and giving your body a small shock to get out of the thought process of getting a drink. Sounds stupid but it works for many people..You mentioned not being 100% committed internally and thinking about moderated drinking. It does not work for 999% of addicts. And do you really want to be that 01% that always has to moderate the one thing you want the most? You would live a miserable life trying to avoid something you love so much. So the key is to see alcohol as the evil destructive drug it is. You have no benefit in drinking even moderately. I spent a good half year with the assumption I could maybe drink moderately some day. And it was not a good feeling. I felt like I was deprived of something. Nowadays I know that I did not LOSE alcohol but WON sobriety. Alcohol is not worth it missing...Keep it up man the cravings will get better as time passes. One last thing:  You always have the choice to drink or not to drink. The booze does not fly into your mouth. Be strong. 
If you can get hold of Russell Brand's audiobook of 'Recovery' it will be a great help. He lays out the whole addict mentality in vivid colours. Not surprising as he is a great communicator. I've been listening to it the last few days and it has helped me. I know how irrational my desire to drink is but today on Day 4 it is returning as the pain returns. He lays out the Cycle of Addiction thus;  ...Pain  .Using alcohol to soothe  .Temporary relief  .Consequences  .Guilt/shame/regret leading to more pain..&amp;#x200B;..Rinse/Repeat.  ...Hang in there. If this was an easy addiction to beat this group wouldn't exist and the world wouldn't be filled with so many casualties.
