So I am excited/happy/proud to hit 60 days today. However it is a tempered excitement. I have hit 60 days before and relapsed. I feel I now have a better understanding (fear?) of relapse. I cannot moderate. I have a mountain of evidence to prove that and I don't need to test that anymore and hopefully never will again. .

Today is good day. Self-awareness makes it a great day. I'm also a long-time tester who has finished with the experimental drinking. I will not drink with you today.
that's awesome.  you got this!  keep going :)
It's so humbling to know that we can be vulnerable at any point - no matter how many days/months/years we have not drinking.

I think it's really healthy to fear relapse. I'm at the point where I know life as I know it is over if I can't keep this together and that makes everything a whole lot easier
Way to go!
Congratulations buddy
