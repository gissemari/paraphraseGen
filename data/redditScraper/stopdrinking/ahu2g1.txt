Title says it. My brother is in town and wants us to join him at the bar. I'm trying to stay on the sober path but my partner  (who admittedly can moderate better than me) broke dry Jan today. I'm annoyed because he knows I'm struggling too. I wanted us to make it through Jan so I'm disappointed. ..I'm reading Allen Carr's book - finding it a bit tough because I just want him to get to the point...Glad I found this sub though. I think I would've caved. I know being sober is better for my mental clarity sleep career and being a present parent. ..

If you've made it this far without serious medical complication it's definitely in your head. I don't mean that in an invalidating way   it was almost comforting for me to realize my brain is trying to pull a mean trick on me. I would try doing some self care or buying something with the money you've saved instead! I bought a crystal and went to Whole Foods for my self care. 
I'm glad you're here with us.  I know that I had to separate my husband's choices regarding substances from my own.  We tried to quit smoking together so many times over the years and one of us would always derail the other at some point by caving.  This time around I decided I was going to go it alone and not even really tell him I was quitting just do it and let him notice on his own.  Sort of a way to keep it all about my own choices.  He drinks wayyyyy less than he used to but will still offer me a drink occasionally so I'm glad I have it as my own goal to stay sober.  ..I'm proud of you for making January a dry month.  You got this!  We're here for you.
The book is repetitive because it is feeding your subconscious mind.  It's part of the plan.  IwndWYT
