I'm sober for 25 years now. Still have the odd dream where I'm thinking 'just one beer' .Not nightmares but enough to wake up and be glad it's only a dream...
Those suck big time...The majority of mine were the first yearish. I was always so disappointed at myself for drinking. The frequency dissipated steadily. Still have one once in awhile. ..In retrospect I'm glad I had the feelings of disappointment after waking up. It allowed me to experience what I'd feel like if I did have that one drink without the consequences. ..One dream specifically stands out. It was short but always involved the look on my Mom's face finding out I was drinking again. Ended up reframing it and using that image as another  of course I'm not going to drink  thought process. ..It gets easier (sleep wise) I promise. Hang in there. ....
