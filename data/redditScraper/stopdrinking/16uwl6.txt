Hello everyone! First I just want to say that I am sorry because this is going to be disgustingly long but I definitely appreciate anybody who actually takes the time to read all of it. Second if this is not the correct subreddit to vent in I apologize for that as well. Please let me know if I need to move this to somewhere else and I will do so but right now I could really use some help ='(...I have avoided posting anything about this aspect of my life mainly because I have seen how most people on Reddit seem to treat people who are going through what I am currently experiencing. I already hate myself enough as it is and the thought of a bunch of people chiming in just to tell me what a stupid worthless and horrible person I am (and apparently also that I deserve to die) is something that I do not need. However I really need a safe place with people who understand and who will not judge me think less of me or hate me because of my past and I am hoping this will turn out to be what is quite possibly the only safe place to actually open up  ..I hate myself right now. Currently on probation for a second DUI that I received in 2010. After my first DUI I was 100% sure that I did not have a problem with alcohol but that I did have some super shitty luck. However I was required to regularly attend AA meetings as a term of my probation so I started going to those several times a week. I genuinely took an interest in the program and the wonderful people I met along the way but once I was off probation I started drinking again and stopped going. I saw no problem with this at the time and continued to go out every weekend get drunk beyond all hope and loved every minute of it. ..It is several years later now and I have been on probation for the second DUI for just short of a year. I did not drink during any of that time but did not go to AA either. For a long time I thought I was doing just fine. In retrospect I probably should have been back on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications during this time but I was in denial and wanted with all my heart to believe that I did not have a problem with alcohol despite some very real and very obvious signs. I had become a master at denial at this point. ..Then came one random night in October. I still have no idea what happened inside my brain. I knew I was not supposed to be drinking I knew the kind of trouble I would face if I got caught but I did it anyway. I do not recall how I ended up justifying to myself that this would be okay but I know that the committee in my head had a drinking justification meeting and I decided to find their reasoning acceptable. The beginning of the night was great and I had a lot of fun. However once my "friend" dropped me off at my house my entire world crashed down upon me. Before I went inside I decided to smoke a cigarette but I wanted to listen to the radio in my vehicle because it was a little bit less cold in there than it was outside (how is that for a ridiculous justification? :/.) So I did. ..There was no actual driving involved just me sitting with the radio on and the smoking of a cigarette. Halfway through said cigarette my vehicle is swarmed by about six cops (all on foot) who all seemingly appeared out of nowhere. (Their reason for being there in the first place is an entirely different chestnut but one that does not technically matter.) Needless to say the fact that I had been drinking and my keys were in the ignition outweighed the fact that I had not been driving nor did I intend to and the fact that my house was about ten feet away. I was arrested that night and charged with another DUI...And this basically brings me to today and every single day of my life for the past three months. I am absolutely destroyed. I am seriously dying inside. Every morning I wake up and as soon as I remember what is going on it just breaks my heart all over again. I know that I deserved the first two DUIs. I was being reckless and irresponsible and an all-around selfish stupid idiot. I know this. But for anybody out there who has struggled with any kind of addiction you know how powerful addiction plus denial can be. And even though I was not driving that night in October when it comes down to it I know that I deserve that DUI too. Regardless of what I did not do the fact of the matter is that at the very least I was still drinking when I am on probation and I should fucking know better than that by now. I am very lucky and very grateful that I never hurt or killed anybody because of my selfishness and irresponsibility. But that is not making it any easier for me to forgive myself for any of this...It absolutely KILLS me that I am in this situation again. I keep thinking of all kinds of should haves would haves could haves... I know deep down that I do not really want to die but sometimes I find myself wishing that I would. I am so tired of disappointing my family. I am so tired of being the bad child in the family the one who continually does the stupidest shit imaginable to fuck up her life. It is bad enough what all of this is doing to me now and how it will affect my life in the future but it feels far worse knowing how much I have let my family down. Again. ..I have not been sentenced for what happened in October yet but I cannot think of a word that exists in the English language to accurately describe the level of absolute terror that I feel inside. I am facing a lot of jail time which is the source of about 97% of this terror. I know that I am not a bad person. I am actually a very good person. A very lost person yes but not a bad one. But I am not strong enough for this. I sat in jail for a week after I got arrested and believe me that was more than enough time in that shithole to know that that is a place I never want to see the inside of again. I may feel like I am destroyed now but jail time is going to fucking obliterate me. I have so many emotions and have always struggled with the fact that I feel them all so deeply. Sometimes I fear that I feel everything far *too* deeply if that is a thing that is possible.  Being thrown in jail to be forgotten about is not going to help me. Sitting around all day every fucking day doing nothing but reading shitty romance novels and watching television and walking around in fucking circles is exactly what I do not need especially not now when I have finally stopped living in Denialville and have officially moved to Acceptancetown. ..*Sidenote: Why is it that people who donate books to jails think that all chicks in jail want to read are romance novels? Seriously. Aside from the fact that I hate them giving chicks books like that when they are already lonely and depressed is just fucking mean. If you ever donate books to a jail donate ANYTHING but romance novels. Trust me they have enough of those already!*..Sitting in jail for that week did give me plenty of time to reflect though. I realized in there that I could not ignore it anymore. I have a problem with alcohol. A huge fucking problem and as much as I never wanted to admit it to myself before I can now. ..I am an alcoholic and I fucking need help...I would remiss to not include something good in this post though as so far I feel like it is nothing more than a long-winded  Woe is me  rant. My probation officer knows about all of this; I let her know the day I got out of jail and she is not only not violating me for this but she is helping me pay for anti-depressant/anti-anxiety medications and helping me find a counselor I can speak to. I must say it is seriously wonderful having a probation officer who does not just want to lock you up and throw away the key when you fuck up and need help. She genuinely cares about me and all she wants to do is help me and I am incredibly grateful to have her in my life right now. I still attend my alcohol class that I have been in since August and the counselor there also let me into her relapse prevention class which I am currently attending simply because I want to be there. I am also going to start attending AA again in the morning. Being able to go there and finally being able to be honest with myself and with everybody else is something I am quite looking forward to. I also enrolled in college and start classes on Tuesday which I am ecstatic about. ..One wonderful thing that came out of all of this is sobriety which I will take however I can get at this point. The condition of me getting out of jail on bond was that I have to wear an alcohol monitor on my ankle until I get sentenced. Regardless of how much I hate this thing (it is ridiculous-looking and disgustingly expensive) it has given me 98 days of sobriety so far. Even though I still get annoyed at times that the courts do not trust that I can not drink without the help of their fancy contraption I understand why they do not trust me. I do not deserve their trust right now but I hope to God they let me earn it...I am doing everything I can to start putting the pieces of my heart and my life back together again. I hate that I did not take any of this seriously before but I fucking pray that the judge will see how serious I am taking this now and how hard I am working to ensure that I never have to drink again. Going to jail is just going to cause me to lose everything. Looking back maybe jail would have been the wake-up call I needed when I was in trouble before but that one single week in jail this time was all the wake-up I needed. ..I just  I do not know. This is the longest fucking post ever and I doubt anybody gives a bag of butts about anything I have to say. I wrote this mostly for therapeutic reasons as I do not have an outlet for my emotions at this point. I am dying inside and I guess I just needed to let all of this shit out even if nobody cares. And yes I already know what a horrible worthless person I am so I really hope nobody here has the urge to beat that quite dead horse. I already know but thank you for your concern  :/...I guess I am just tired. Tired of being a failure - in my eyes my parents' eyes and society's eyes. Tired of getting myself in this situation. Tired of living life in such constant fear and shame and absolute fucking misery. Tired of drinking. I am fucking sick of all of it. I am simultaneously too young and too old to still be living like this...I am also very sorry to anybody who actually read through this whole post. I know it is way too fucking long but like I said before I really have no other outlet at this moment and all of this woeful rambling is just a mess of emotions that I cannot hold in anymore. Thank you to anybody who actually reads this though. I know I fucked up but I am exhausting every resource I have available to ensure that I do not have to live like this anymore. I am definitely in the midst of the rockiest bottom right now and I need to get the hell out...I am trying to not have a complete emotional meltdown which I suppose is why I posted this here. I do not really know anybody out here yet so I do not have anybody to talk to so I hope it is okay that I posted this novel of lameness here =(. I am just a very tormented girl right now and I do not know where else to turn. Thank you very much for listening and letting me get this off my chest though it means a lot to me. I hope you are all having a great night =).......**TL;DR** I am a fucking idiot. Do not be like me...**EDIT:** I just wanted to thank everyone here for all of the kind words and advice and support. This is a seriously wonderful place with wonderful people and I am very glad I found it. Thank you for letting me get all of this off my chest and for not judging me for it. I really appreciate everything you have done for me already and I just want you all to know that. Thank you for the support and thank you for welcoming me into the community. It really means a lot to me <3...Also according to my badge I have 86 days not 98. Apparently I suck at counting lol..
----------immediate responses--------

"Bag of butts" you I like you. Well so you've fucked up a whole hell of a lot. But yer not dead and you ain't kilt no one! So yeah I'm here to tell you that I don't hate you and I don't think you're a fuck up failure or a piece of shit. You're a person. And you need help. What can I do to help you? Are you in Phoenix by any chance? If you want to skype let me know. ..You are not dying. You're growing and that shit hurts like a mother. You are not dying! Girl this can be the beginning of something beautiful if you want it to. I know it looks dark and nasty but sometimes when you wanna make something really pretty you gotta break down the components first. Every day you have a new chance to make great choices and really be the woman you know you are on the inside. I'm sure you have changed a lot since that last drink. 98 days sober is a great accomplishment and it certainly clears the mind of all the fog. Work on the negative self talk we can't have any of that here. It doesn't serve you. You are a wonderful person who's made some bad choices. But you *are not* your bad choices. You are a person with feelings and goals wants needs desires talents and I'm guessing a laugh that is pretty infectious. Love yourself all of you and let us love you too. How can I help you?
I read it. You're welcome. Good luck!
You're not a bad person.  You're a good person who's made a few bad decisions. You'll have to deal with the consequences of those but don't think for one second that you're a bad person. You're not.  And I can tell because I feel like we're best friends after reading that whole thing.  "Oh FantasyDoll yeah she and I go way back.  I first met her when I started reading her post about 3 years ago."  ;)..Hey you can't change the past.  And you can't control the future.  If you could do either of those things you wouldn't be here posting on reddit you'd be owning reddit.  Er or maybe something a little more profitable.  Reddit's not really the best choice.  Anyway my point is you can't spend time worrying about things you can't change or can't control.  All you can do is focus on today.  You have complete control over what you do *today*.  Make today the best today it can possibly be and whatever else happens happens.  I'm not trying to sound like a dirty hippy but what other choice do you have? What happened happened. What's gonna happen isn't yet set in stone you don't know what it will be.  And if the worst does happen aren't you only making it even worse by worrying about it now?..I'm rambling.  Sorry.  You can't worry about things you don't control.  It'll kill you.  That's what I'm trying to say...Every single person on this Earth has made mistakes.  The most successful people have failed.  The happiest people out there have been miserable in the past.  The difference is that they didn't let their mistakes drag them down. They learned from them they made positive changes in their lives and they moved on.  They didn't dwell on their failures they focused on making one day - today - the best day it could possibly be.  One mistake does not a person make. They all did it.  And you can do it too.
You are learning and growing...One day (maybe soon) you will be wise (and hopefully still humble) beyond your imagination...I will be asking my higher power to help you.
It's ok. It's ok. I'm following you. Please keep posting and I'll keep reading. 
Thank you for sharing. I read the entire thing and I know it will be hard to see and might not mean much from random Internet stranger but there's a good amount of people who care. There are a lot of people here alone that read this. Your probation officer also sees to care and I am assuming you were released on bail so the judge must trust you as we'll that you are trying to get things in order. ..You know what happened is dumb and bad but that doesn't make you a bad person. Stick around long enough and you will see similar stories and similar feelings of shamefulness. You're in the right place. Welcome and best of luck. 
Well done for writing this. Must have been hard...I can't add much to the wonderful replies that you've already had but just wanted to say hi and that I'm really impressed at your 98 days. ..Just make sure to keep sober stay alive and come back here when you need to post again ..::hugs::
I also read this. Im sorry for your pain right now. I remember what it was like putting my life back together. Hang in there. 
You're right.  That was long.  And heartbreaking.  And I'm sorry you're going through it.  As others have already said "you're not a bad person you've just done some bad things."  Its good to read after what you've been through that you're taking steps to make your life better.  I agree with offtherocks that worrying about things you have no control over won't do you any good.  Focus on the things you do have control over which it sounds like you have started doing...I too have done some things I'm ashamed of.  But something I'm extremely proud of is finally recognizing this awful thing I've been doing to myself and my family and doing something about it...Good luck with the things you are doing for yourself.  I really hope that you get some leniency.  But more if you do I hope you take advantage of it...Please keep posting here and join us in the chat room (info in the sidebar).
Wow. You sound exactly like me two years ago. Facing yet another DUI feeling like the disappointing fuck up daughter woke up with shame and heartache everyday beyond lonely and isolated. It's giving me goosebumps! Even with so much uncertainty(which is also scary as hell) you know what's coming: a long ass road. Lots of fear moments of beautiful awakening shame that feels like 1000 lbs chained to you new appreciation for freedom. Expect all this and more. ..Gotta just keep going. Smile though you're terrified and ashamed. Laugh even when you expect the worst. Take it from me it will pass! There is a "pause" button in life and yours has been pushed. But "play" will come back. Just have to be strong. The strongest you've ever been. You're an alcoholic not a leper! Be proud of who you are becoming. You will get through this and you will be stronger because of it. ..PM me whenever you need to. Really whenever. I'm held up in bed due to an injury and surgery so I've got a lot if spare time. I've got you in my heart girl.
I can relate to every time you say "I know I shouldn't". You do know you shouldn't. That's the problem though. That's why we are addicts...It's too late to not be like you. Or hell I don't know how old you are maybe I was like you before you were (hipster addict?). I know that I shouldn't be the way I am and you know you shouldn't be the way you are. That's what brings us to this type of place. I'll even wager you scream at yourself how stupid you are while you drive to the store/bar/party... Just like me. You've already convinced yourself you are going to drink and your mind has started it's "DJ'ing" for the night. It's going to play one of these songs: "Fuck it I don't care" "I deserve at least one night" or "It's okay to slip" by "The Alcoholics". It sucks I know...You've got to come to the conclusion that you've hit rock bottom. This is it. You've lost a lot one more and you lose everything. Don't look around your stuff doesn't mean anything. You could have all that stuff back in a few years. What you'll lose is your freedom and for all I know your family. Your health is another issue all by itself. Find a reason to stop. Stop for yourself stop for someone else it doesn't matter.Things will get better. ..I'm definitely not the expert on such things because I have all sorts of fucked up issues myself but I will give you my word on this: If you stop drinking your life will be better than it is while you are drinking. This is a fact that no one will dispute...edit: You have your age in the title so "I don't even know how old you are" is rather stupid. But I've been drinking heavily since I was 15 so still who knows?
You should ask about Drug Court or Drug Treatment Court.  I had a unknown drinking problem and the Drug court system worked wonders for me. It's a lot of hard work that includes mandatory AA meetings outpatient treatment court every week probation visits every week and 3 UA's a week but it kept me sober and helped me regain control of my once fucked up life. ..I felt the exact same way you feel right now OP.  you should consider yourself lucky that no one got hurt during your drinking career and start planning out your new future without drugs/alcohol! After reading your entire post you seem like a sick person trying to get well not a bad person trying to be good.  I'm serious look into drug court it's a bitch at first but it will change your life. ..Good luck in the future OP. you'll be in my thoughts. 
I read your whole post.  thanks for writing it especially this..&gt;I guess I am just tired. Tired of being a failure - in my eyes my parents' eyes and society's eyes. Tired of getting myself in this situation. Tired of living life in such constant fear and shame and absolute fucking misery. Tired of drinking. I am fucking sick of all of it. I am simultaneously too young and too old to still be living like this...you've helped me today thanks.

I attend an AA meeting in state prison and often hear "being arrested was the only way I could stop" .The disease is so incredibly powerful. Recovering from it alone is for me next to impossible with AA or other programs it actually becomes a pleasant way of life.  .You can get through this and if you reach out you can get incredible support.  Hopefully you can stay out of the pokey but if not take AA with you.

I read every word of what you wrote.  ..I think you need to make a shift in perspective. Instead of saying "I'm a horrible worthless person" try saying "I've done things in the past that made me feel like a horrible worthless person."  ..It's a subtle difference but a powerful one. Because it isn't who you ARE that has made you feel this way but what you've DONE. And you can't change the past. What you can do is take control of today and do nothing today that's going to make you feel crappy. In fact you can do things today that are going to make you feel great.  ..You've already done one very important thing and that's admitting that you feel like crap and posting here for help and support. And you got some and I bet you feel a little better. Do it again. Make it an ongoing saga and keep us all updated on your progress. We're rooting for you you're one of us now and we'll all band together to help you pull through this.  ..Every single last one of us here has done some pretty stupid shit while we were drinking. We all felt miserable and powerless and heartbroken at the chaos we left in our wake. All of us. We turned it around and you have the power to do it too and we'll help.  ..So my beautiful FantasyDoll take a deep breath accept our collective StopDrinking internet hug and get to work on making today feel better than yesterday. Tomorrow can take care of itself...EDIT: I have a gift for you if you like. I just registered "Bag_of_Butts" as a Reddit username. It's yours as an alt if you want it. Just PM me and I'll send you the password.
Thank you so much for taking time to write all of that.  It seems that you are handling this craziness as best as could be expected.  What a horrible situation.  I am so sorry.  I am really glad that you have such a great probation officer.  Let them read this let the judge read it.  It shows your desire to change and how you sincerely believe that jail time will not help anything.  
Some accidents seem designed to happen. You surely knew know that you can not be in a driver seat - driving or not - when drunk. It even took a special meeting of the "committee in my head" to put yourself into that situation. Similar kind of shit happened to me in various occasions. I now realise that it is similar to Russian roullette: you hope you get away with it but in the end you let outside forces deal with the outcome. In your case the bullit took the form of police officers and now you are looking at some time. I hope it all turns out fine (I imagine it should but I am no judge) but at the end of the day you are still alive and you have not harmed anyone. I say it's something you will be able to build on.
Darlin stop beating yourself up. First of all this is exactly the right place because we've all done stupid things that we regret because of alcohol (and sometimes other stuff too). By the way you have a lovely writing style and I had no problem getting totally immersed in your story (thank you for sharing it I can relate to a lot!)...Now would you PLEASE stop talking shit about yourself?! Listen to me: What you believe to be true about yourself IS TRUE. I think that's why prayer works for so many of us; we pray and pray to change for the desire to be removed and it actually works. The flipside is that if you call yourself an idiot or stupid if you hate yourself you're basically just grating away at the part of you that should be getting built up and eventually you believe you're a horrible worthless piece of shit (speaking from experience)...We've established you have 3 DUIs. I should be a felon but I was 17 (thank God) I physically assault my boyfriend when I'm blacked out and I was an escort to pay for all the alcohol when I was 21. We all make mistakes. ..We've also established that you're intensely emotional which tells me you're probably super tuned in and aware; you're going to college and stoked about it so even if you don't think you're smart yet you're obviously intelligent; you have a good relationship with your PO (not always easy with authority figures) and you clearly understand your own issues with drinking and are working to fix them. Oh and you hate romance novels! That's just what I remember from reading your post once and I would totally hang out with you if we met in a meeting or something. ..You have a lot of really great qualities going for you the you that's going to college and getting sober and *trying* but the half of you that should just be withering away and dying (as all of our inner idiots hopefully do) is so busy beating up the awesome half that you've almost forgotten about it. Stop beating yourself up you sound super cool.
Tons of great advice right here so I'm not going to repeat it. ..But I will say that I am 29 and I have 4 DWI's under my belt along with multiple ass-kickings. I feel great today and am glad to have been through what I have been through. It made me the person that I am today. I wish it didn't take so much to get the point across but I was hard-headed and needed it to make a life change...It is NOT the end of the world it IS a new beginning! It might be hard to see now but the fog will clear...You can do it!!

FantasyDoll I am a criminal defense lawyer.  I have seen about a bazillion people screw up for silly reasons.  And I've seen alot of people go to jail.  But you know what?  I also see a whole bunch of people have lives that are better than they ever thought possible once they start dealing with their addictions...Jail sucks and it's scary.  I hope you don't have to go.  Where I live it's a mandatory 120 days for a 3rd offense.  If you do have to go you will survive.  It will be awful but you'll do it...And when you continue your sobriety your family will be proud of you.  You will be pround of yourself.  You will make a good mentor for others...You are a good writer; perhaps you should blog about all this.
TL:DR : Wow I had not intended this to be so long but got carried away telling part of my story.  Bottom line I had 3 DUIs yet didn't use them as a wake up call to get some. Not really believing I had a problem my drinking continued to get far far worse until my life was very much an unbearable hell every single day. At that point I finally reached the point where I just could not go on anymore chose to get sober went to AA and despite my lack of faith that it would work found exactly the solution that I needed.....Congrats on using your DUIs as a wake up call...When I was growing up every time I rode with my dad in his truck  he ALWAYS had a beer between his legs. I can't say for sure whether he was drunk or not but from an early age I was taught by example that drinking and driving was a normal everyday thing. In no was was I ever taught while young that drunk driving was a bad thing...When I started drinking around age 18 I did what I thought was normal and really didn't think twice about driving drunk. A few months later (still18) I crashed my car in a blackout and got my first DUI. They were very lenient with me and reduced the charges to reckless driving and I only had to pay a moderate fine and go without driving for a month. I was NOT a frequent drinker at this time but in looking back today i realize that regardless of infrequent drinking when I did drink I always drank until the booze was gone or I blacked out. Being that booze was hard to come by at my age the booze was usually gone before I had much more than a mild buzz. I didn't even consider that I had a problem and so I saw no reason to quit drinking. ..At age 21 I got my second DUI again crashing a car in a blackout. This time the charges stuck. I had a rather large fine and lost my license for 6 months. I had to spend a weekend in jail attend therapy with a councilor and had to attend a handful of AA meetings. I didn't have to get a card signed at AA so they only knew I went because I told them I did but I attended only the minimum number of meetings I was required to and then stopped. I also only attended the minimum number of therapy sessions that I was required to. With all of this going on I still couldn't see that I had a problem. I still was not drinking all that frequently and really wasn't a binge drinker either as I'd usually only drink a pint of 40 proof flavored schnapps on a Friday or Saturday night. Even so I DID alway drink until the booze was gone. It was just that by the time I finished my pint of schnapps the liquor stores were closed and I could not get more. The night of my DUI I was at a wedding and brought my own bottle of wine. With nearly unlimited booze at the reception and my own supply I attempt to do what I always did and tried to keep drinking until the booze was gone...After my second DUI I moved to a different state to start my first job after college. I was alone and knew no one. I was never very good at making friends and became very very lonely. I started drinking more frequently than before and before long found myself drinking nearly every day. I drank beer at the time and would buy a 12 pack and drink it all the same evening. I never had any left over. ..Attempting to alleviate my loneliness I started going to bars. My drinking really started to get serious at this time. Since I had always drank until the booze was gone I would almost always drink at the bar until it closed (no more booze to drink). I was drinking far more than I ever had in my life. I would occasionally drink till blackout and still drive home. Then one day I was invited to a party after closing. I really didn't know where it was but drove in the general direction hoping to find it and went into a backout. I came out of the blackout just after I crashed through a gate at the end of a dead end street. Boom! I had my 3rd DUI AT 23. ..This third DUI was serious business. Two in five years made it a gross misdemeanor. This happened on a Friday night but a gross misdemeanor meant that I was not allowed to bail out until I entered a plea in front on the judge on the following Monday. Thus I got to spend the weekend in jail...Being charged with a gross misdemeanor meant I faced a year in jail and a $10000 fine. I tried to plead guilty in front of the judge on Monday but he rejected my plea and told me to get a lawyer. I got a lawyer who got the sentence reduced to a week in jail and a $3000 fine. My lawyer was somewhat of a sleezeball though and he convinced my to challenge the search of my vehicle and claim lack of probable cause. Because my lawyer was such a fuck up I ended up losing my drivers license  for 2 and a half years rather than just one year...This third DUI started to make me realize that I had a problem with alcohol. But I never even considered quitting drinking. While I was starting to think that I might be an alcoholic I really didn't quite understand what that meant. I thought I could just cut down on drinking try to avoid driving drunk and everything would be fine. I really didn't want to QUIT drinking because drinking was still FUN. But I was absolutely convinced that I could control it. I was lying to myself though and not only did the amount I drank continue to increase I could not even stop myself from continuing to drive drunk...Fast forward 6 years. I was drinking daily and was no longer drinking because it was fun drinking just to feel normal. I entered treatment for the second time and while I was sober for 9 months I had never really thought about nor committed to staying sober forever. When I found myself in front on the liquor store one day just by accident I went in bought a bottle took it home and drank it. I drank another bottle the next day and was right back to where I was before treatment...Now I started to find myself in real trouble. My drinking very rapidly increased to way beyond what it had been before I went to treatment. It wasn't long before I found myself drinking in morning the very quickly drinking all through the day. Daily and all day long withdrawals were an everyday fact of life. I was drinking a quart of 100 proof vodka a day every day 7 days a week. Withdrawals were unbearable and nearly constant. I was no longer drinking because it was fun. I was no longer drinking to feel normal I was drinking solely because the withdrawals were unbearable and I felt like I was dying if I didn't drink. Drinking didn't make the withdrawals go away but it made them a little better...This went on for the last three years of my drinking until I just could not go on one more day. I wanted to die and found myself composing a suicide note. I was ready to kill myself but when I realized I lacked a painless was to kill myself I completely broke down. I was broken and desperate confused and angry alone and afraid. ..I couldn't go on this way and lacking the means to kill myself I did the unthinkable. I had completely rejected AA back when I went though treatment but I dug out a meeting schedule they had given me back in treatment looked up the closest meeting and ended up at a meeting that night. I was desperate and finally willing to try absolutely anything to make tomorrow be a little better than today. If that meant getting sober and going to AA then so be it. I was in no position to dismiss anything that may help...While I still had a few drinks left it me I attended daily AA meetings. I tried to go to meetings as often as I went to the liquor store and I had been going to 4 different liquor stores a day. I committed to putting every bit as much time and effort into getting sober as I had put into drinking. I jumped into the program with both feet. I honestly did not believe it would work but I was desperate and I WANTED it to work. I saw people at AA that had what I wanted and I was willing to do everything they did in order to get what they had. While I didn't believe AA would work I was bound and determined that if if failed that it WOULD NOT BE because I didn't try hard enough. ..After three months of daily AA meetings I finally had my last drink although I didn't know it at the time. After 6 months of meetings and three months on continuous sobriety the miracle happened and I woke up one day and realized I hadn't thought about drinking in a while. The mental obsession to drink which had been a constant was gone. Utterly completely and absolutely gone. It was like a 10 ton weight was lifted from my shoulders. Not picking up a drink had ceased to be a conscious decision that took some effort. Alcohol had completely lost its appeal and the desire to drink was gone and the decision to not pick up a drink had become a completely effortless decision. In more than 15 years the obsession to drink has never returned...
im not an alcoholic in the way you are but i identify with you...i drink my balls off but i have been ridiculously lucky to never get into trouble...i think its because of where i live its smaller town so as long as you are reasonable it all works out...you situation with your third arrest...thats staggering...but...my friend has a worse story...he was getting drunk the night before his 21st birthday.  a cop stopped him for jaywalking saw he was drunk and took his license for a year...he was 21 years old and couldnt enjoy drinking until he was 22.....i know what its like to not be able to help yourself.  to know that you should know better.  that you shouldnt do it...but you do anyway.  you dont quite know why but you just say fuck it...i hear you...i am a determinist so a lot of life comes down to circumstance in my opinion...you are the result of everything around you and you are going to do whatever you are meant to...so its really fucked up to have to say this but what i try to do is look at myself in the mirror and imagine myself at age 50...what will i look like?..im a fat fuck now and i pray i get the get inspired to lose weight soon...but i ask myself what will i look like?  where will i be working?  what will my life be like?..and then i think...what do i want it to be like?..basic stuff.  i want kids.  job security.  success.  maybe a boat.  to really devote a lot of my time to charity work.  to helping others and leading by example...then i think...well...what am i doing that will hinder that dream?..im not a bad guy.  i will get there eventually.  i just need to make sure i dont derail my future...so i have to give some things up...going out and getting ridiculous.  saying anything i want to whoever i want.  doing dangerous shit in general...i just give it up...so that when i'm 50 i can look into that mirror and smile...good luck man.
