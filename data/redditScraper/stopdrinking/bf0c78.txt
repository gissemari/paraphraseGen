I am 53 days without alcohol today but almost lost it all last night.  With the warmer weather finally here I had it in my mind that last night I was going to drink. I had a coworkers party to go to at night and just wanted a release and to relax and unwind with everyone. ..&amp;#x200B;.. As soon as I got home from work I opened a bottle of wine I had been given as a gift and poured myself a glass. I sat for over an hour holding the glass smelling it and going back and forth on if it was worth it or not. The stress this caused me was terrible. I kept going back and forth with the decision in my mind. The fact that it caused me this much anxiety reminded me why I started this journey in the first place. I eventually decided to shower and get ready for the party.  Getting dressed was a distraction and gave me more time to think. I thought I would at least wait until the party started and then decide if I was going to have a drink. ..&amp;#x200B;..Luckily after walking to the event I felt calmer and had no interest even though everyone around me was drinking.  Just their company was enough for me as I had my soda water and enjoyed the conversation.  ..&amp;#x200B;..The first 30 days for me were relatively easy but I feel like the real struggles are happening now.  I sat on this thread last night planning my relapse and deciding that I could just start again. I was basically trying to find validation from this sub that I could have a slip night and then start again and be fine. But for what?..&amp;#x200B;..Anyways today is a gloomy rainy and such an ugly day. I am so happy I didn't wake up hungover and full of regret. shame and disappointment.  I am grateful that I didn't give in last night even though I felt like I had been having the strongest craving and urge to drink I've had yet. ..If I have any advice; just give urges time.  Go on a walk call a friend paint and do anything you can to distract yourself. Eventually the feeling will pass and you will come to and not believe that you were so close to making a decision you know deep down you didn't want to make. ..&amp;#x200B;..Keep it up friends!

That shows great strength! I'm not sure I could have resisted to drink after pouring myself a glass so intentionally.. well done for making another day!
