I'm just posting this to vent...Only 10 days ago I wrote [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/4hxhjk/best_100day_celebration_i_could_have_asked_for/). It's really scary how quickly you can go from that to the way I'm feeling now. A special warm thought goes out to /u/RedHeadedRiot today. I'm finding so much inspiration in your posts. You're so strong for getting back from your relapse so quickly and already looking at a week of sobriety again :) I also realize that I'm very close to relapsing myself so I'm doing everything I can to prevent it because now there will be some bad consequences if I do relapse...I'm regretting getting sober in the first place I'm regretting seeking help for it but it's too late to turn back now...* Social situations are becoming more and more difficult. I'm becoming the person I was 3 years ago before I started drinking heavily to deal with my shyness. I'm back in my shell and I just can't seem to relax or be the person I want to be anymore. I don't know what else to do. I'm not sleeping or eating well and have no desire to..* If I were to avoid all social situations with alcohol I'd be all alone. The people in AA are at least 20 years older than me and I only have one thing in common with them. Getting sober as a college student in Norway is not easy. http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/Guide+to+norwegians+by+canadian+engineer+sooo+obviously+not+mine_5c5023_5083801.jpg.* I'm going to therapy once a week but it's not helping so far. It's just making matters worse because:.* I will literally [lose my driving licence](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/4irx68/diagnosed_alcoholic_no_driving_for_6_months/)  if I don't stick with sobriety for at least 6 months. It makes me feel like a fucking convict. This is a huge burden because it's not up to me anymore. Up to this point it was difficult but it was always *my* choice. Taking one day at a time is almost impossible when I know it's going to be at least 6 months..* In December I failed an exam and I never got any good explanation why. I took the same exam again yesterday and failed again. It's an oral exam and I had the same examiners as last time. I can't seem to manage to say what I want to say for some reason. Because of the "3 chances rule" I only have one more try. If I fail the next time it will be impossible for me to finish my BA degree. If that happens I have no idea what I'm going to do with my life..* I got my last student loan payout today. I don't have enough credits to get a new loan next semester so I'll have to find a job somehow but I have no motivation anymore..* I decided to "semi-relapse" today and bought my first [snus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snus) in 110 days and some cans of Red Bull and Coke. It's better than the alternative and I don't regret it at all..* I bought a street magazine and am going to help at a confirmation today. Maybe it'll make me feel better..* My living situation is a disaster. When I moved in here it was with 2 other friends + 1 random dude. My friends got boyfriends and moved out so now I'm living with 3 random dudes who I don't know and 2 of them are crazy. They spend most of their time sitting in their rooms and the guy next to me laughs frantically all the time. It's driving me insane. I'm wearing noise-cancelling earbuds when I'm home. I'm moving out over the summer to live with friends again but I have no realistic way to pay the rent at the new place. I'm fearing I'll have to borrow money from my parents again if they'll let me..* My father drinks so much and I don't think he's taking my sobriety seriously. He usually drinks when we spend time together..* I'm going to a party later. It's with some of my best friends so I have to go (for me not for them) because staying at home would be worse. I've told them how I'm feeling these days so they understand. I'm hoping I can muster some positivity and have a good time tonight..* We're having our last exams over the next couple of weeks. In the beginning of June we're having a goodbye party and 2 of my best friends are moving very far away. I've been dreading that day for over a year instead of enjoying the time we've had and even if many of my friends will still be here it's very difficult for me to deal with. The future is so scary man..* I wasn't going to mention this because I consider my English better than average but having to type out all of this in a second language adds another layer to it. It takes me much longer because I have to double-check everything I write...Sorry about the wall of text but I just needed to get this out...Have a great day peeps. I will not drink with you today...**EDIT: Had an amazing night. I do not understand these mood swings.**

First I'm glad you're here.  Your English is 100 times better than my Norwegian!  ..Secondly I have compassion for your struggles.  ..I hope the best for you.  I hope you get to focus on "one day" rather than all these difficult issues together.
