I can remember all the times I'd run into people while hungover and struggle to 'act normal' through the haze of a hangover.  Today's interaction was a nice reminder how much easier life is without that as a factor. ..Also it's just really nice to get a compliment! I'm in the weeds with school so it's really easy for me to feel like I'm just maintaining every day that every day is just a blur of work and homework. Being reminded that I have changed is a good reminder for me of how incremental it can all be. ..My brain is tired so I'm probably rambling. .TLDR: I've worked hard to create change in many areas of my life I'm doing it for me but it's a nice bonus when somebody sees that I am different than I was before. :) ..

Yay for you!...I'm looking forward to looking better and knowing it..hearing it too!..I already see changes can't wait for more that sobriety will bring.
Isn't it awesome? I haven't seen anyone who hasn't seen me in a while but for me I notice it. The biggest one is the bloat around my middle is gone. I'll take that benefit and run with it...lol! ..Great job!
What a great feeling! Congratulations!
Awesome!  Keep up the good work.  I look like a different person.  I get compliments a lot and it does help!
Huzzah!  Last night I got in a mild craving spiral and I started thinking about how great it would be to **never** be hungover again.  It just took so much *effort* I have no idea how I ever held up the facade for so long...Here's to looking and feeling amazing!  I will not drink with you today.
Congrats! It's always nice for others to notice how well you're doing...I can relate to the struggling to act normal. It struck me on Monday how *easy* it was to interact with people while sober. I used to come in to the office every single Monday hungover. I was constantly trying to look and act normal all while hating myself and feeling like hell. How the hell did I do it all the time? More importantly *why* did I do it all the time?..I'll not drink with you - and actually feel normal - today.
We don't notice it that much because after some time not drinking is just a habit we have to maintain. The internal fight is tiring but on the external we look so much better. We can see it everytime someone posts a before/after picture here.
Nice.
