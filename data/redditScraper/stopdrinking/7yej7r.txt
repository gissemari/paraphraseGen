Doing something over and over expecting different results .-Albert Einstein..I have been trying to quit drinking for a year. My first attempt was 2/11/17. I made it 34 days. Continue on with the year and lots of starts and stops. On 2/11/18 I stopped drinking again but this time asked myself what I was going to do different. ..After a year of going it alone except for all of you here at SD I decided to try AA. I was SO nervous but thought what I had been doing wasn't working.  I read old posts here on SD and they were right on. Everyone was very welcoming. The hardest part was walking through the door.  My first meeting was perfect for me. My second not as great but good. I plan on working my way through women only meetings in my area...One thing I wanted to share is that I have found that it makes a difference to see another alcoholic in person. Seeing the struggle in their eyes relecting my own struggle is very motivating. Seeing they are just like anyone I would pass on the street is eye opening. While I am not sure yet what I will take out of the AA program meeting with others like me is comforting. I plan on trying a local Refuge Recovery meeting here next week too. I am finding in person support extremely important. ..Another thing I decided to do was quit smoking. I absolutely cannot drink because the 2 go hand in hand. If I drink I will smoke and then I failed at 2 things rather then one. While I have one week of no drinking I am only on day 2 of no smoking. The struggle is real! ..I am a big lurker here on SD but wanted to share today. Not drinking with you all. Happy Sunday!

Congratulations!..We're such social creatures even those of us who are introverts...having a community/fellowship is a great source of strength for me. I hope you enjoy RR it's been my program since I quit! Most of our community also do AA in tandem it's great because there is much better "coverage" in terms of meeting availability. Keep us posted!
Congrats on a Week and welcome out of lurker mode! ..&gt;it makes a difference to see another alcoholic in person. Seeing the struggle in their eyes reflecting my own struggle is very motivating...I feel the same way :).
