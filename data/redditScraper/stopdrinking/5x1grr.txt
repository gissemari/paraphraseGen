Hi r/stopdrinking!..I want to thank all of you for the immense support and being there when I needed ya. I never would have believed I could make it this far. I have to say it sure was no picknick from time to time. I still have cravings sometimes and I noticed I had a stray thought just the other day that went like; ..      "I have been without alcohol for so long was it really so bad? Did it really make me feel ill?". I smirked thought and said aloud "Hell yeah!" (in the car and I was alone). ..My health has been greatly improved in the beginning but it is the overall baseline that improves nowadays.. Overall it is not very noticeable from day to day anymore. Small tiny events things I suddenly realise are going better smooth less friction and problems lower impact of stress that is what I notice. Here is a small recap of highlights for every champion out there who decided to stop drinking and are still climbing the majority of this hill......1) Sweats. I used to have a huge sweatting problem. My armpits reeked when I got stressed I literally could get sick from my own smell it was so fowl. It embarrassed me when sitting next to a colleague to help out and I never knew why. After 3+ months I hardly break a sweat. No wet spots smells even when things get tough I seem to handle them with much more calm...2) The self confidence. This one took a while to build up. When drinking i noticed I stammered a lot made a lot of verbal mistakes in what I wanted to say and what I actually said. Small words wrong words when someone laughed at me or at my expense (we have a culture where we sometimes pick on eachother and I honestly do not mind) but I could never have a witty remark back play along and my jokes came out uncertain had to repeat them or it felt like a strain to actually try to be funny. Now our social interactions are like a well oiled machine. Our jokes back and forth feel like we are two seasoned standup comedians or "old brothers" that go way back and I have fun doing it...3) Stress reduction. Although I still struggle with stress (more from being overwhelmed with backlog work demand of my work and responsibilities) back in the day I could get so worked up when something went wrong that I was so hyper and tense that I could not unwind at home (hence the need to drink). Lately my sleep pattern is so regular I can almost predict 10:22pm will be lights out for me. When I close my eyes I am gone. I wake up before my own alarm clock and I have never woken up so early...4) The serenity and routine in the morning. I never had one. I woke up did my thing went to work in a blur and got more stressed out because there was too much work to deal with and what I wanted to do I never got finished got home and there was more work... Right now I have a routine. And it actually works! I get up around 5:30 am take a cup of coffee then I meditate for 10-15 minutes. The day before I write a journal to myself with tasks I extract from a personal "backlog" keeping in mind the events to come. It gives me calm and rest and awareness to do this and the next morning I mentally prepare for this list so that it feels like smooth sailing as it comes for that day. At the end of the day I evaluate and write again close off the journal and start a new one for the next day. The first lines are always what I learned from myself and what I can do better and what I need to look out for (energy wise health tasks urgencies) and of course praise of all that went well...Those are major items the smaller things are in every day tasks improved memory where I can actually remember more than 5 items for my shopping list where I feel less worried about things where I can cope with mess in the house more feel more confident to actually plan and do things. It feels like my life is in control! And the part I can't control but desperately wanted to I learned to let go. Nothing is ideal. The feeling of "why should I give a f*ck about this". And it puts things in perspective. It makes life worth living when you're not stressed over small OCD'ish messes...So to everyone who struggles who does not see the benefits just you wait. Stay calm and re-evaluate your life when you get a moment. And that moment will come. And looking back at the times I struggled so much how far off the deep end my body was with emotions and health just shows me I never want to touch alcohol again. There is no going back. .......Sometimes it is still one day at the time. Or a tough moment where my wife "celebrates" with a drink and I feel left out with things I can use to celebrate but then I look back and think nahh. We have a good time. I am not going to make myself regret this. I want to be cheerful and happy tomorrow too...Most of the days I am ok I listen to the podcast of Marc Maron a lot (suggested here a few times) called WTF. He touches substance abuse and his (or the guests) history with it a lot which empowers me as he is sober for 15 years and talks to a lot of people who also abused alcohol in the past. It is like listening to r/stoprinking with celebreties from TV and never knew went so deep. ..So to close this I am grateful. Grateful for every person who commented empowering words on threads I started and felt heard and understood. I stay strong. Stronger than any member of my family does and rise above it all (not my family but the alcohol problem that most members of my family have) and see the beast it for what it really is. I recognise patterns...And as I type this my wife just spilled some wine. How ironic :-) I better help her clean it up.. Thanks all
