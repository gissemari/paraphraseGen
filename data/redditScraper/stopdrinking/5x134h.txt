I am pretty sure I have a drinking problem which has been noticed by friends family and therapists. I just don't know that I am ready to take the plunge into full sobriety again. I was sober last time for over 100 days after I had an incident. I went to Vegas and relapsed and never looked back. Thinking about getting sober again for my own health and the health of others around me. How do you know you are ready to take on the commitment that sobriety entails?

I didn't think about it. I just did it and coped day to day. I got a lot of help and just kept it simple.
After I was diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis I had to accept the fact that I obviously had a problem. And that I could never drink again if I intended to be around for my kid. ..Up until then I wasn't going to stop for anything. Please don't wait til you damage your body. I wish I'd listened to my husband's concerns sooner. ..I won't drink with you! 
The day I decided to stop drinking was the day I decided to do something about it today rather than viewing it as future-me's problem. I came to accept that I had a problem that wasn't going to go away I was fearful for the risk to my health. I figured I'd had plenty of days drinking and decided to try another way. ..I was in two minds still when I started but I just kept going trying to put distance between me and my last drink acknowledging myself for monthly milestones. It wasn't until I passed four months sober that I felt deep-down ready to commit to remaining this way.
For me and I'm 3 days in it's been too many attempts. I'm tired of feeling like crap after drinking. My anxiety is worse the more I drink and more recently I've been turning into an angry drunk. I yelled at my boyfriend the other day for no good reason and after that I decided enough is enough.
