I got divorced two years ago.  The fear grief and anger were huge emotions that I was terrified of confronting.  The only way I knew how to live my current reality was to numb it with booze.  I drank heavily and played the avoidance game....except it didnt work out that well for me at all.  Those emotions are so large that they're going to come out whether you want them to or not.  I handled myself poorly for the next two years and ended up in a place where I couldn't run anymore.  I knew I had to quit drinking or lose my mind...I got sober (with a few relapses) and I started to learn the uncomfortable truth.  Those feelings are still there.  Some are softened by the passage of time but they're still there and now I have to deal with them.  Sobriety is so much more than just quitting booze.  Its the onset of accountability its the gradual awakening of you--the good and the bad.  My sponsor told me in the beginning that "You'll do the same things sober as you did drunk."  I took this literally of course and thought that I don't think I'll be up in bars dancing until 2 am on a Tuesday etc.  But further in I realize exactly what she meant...Underneath all of it I'm the same old me.  All of those basic components of me didn't die they were just in hibernation of sorts.  The fear is there.  It wakes me up at 3 am but this time I don't choose to chase it away with booze.  I welcome it with all of its uncomfortable jagged edges.  This time my heart is open and I'm ready to take it on.  God its exhausting to not feel comfortable in your own skin for months on end but its also the satisfying exhaustion that comes with personal growth and a new journey.  ..Getting sober was the best thing I've ever done for myself.  I wish that I'd done it sooner but I dont regret a single drink I've ever had because it makes the fabric of who I am today.  No regrets.  I love this sub and the encouragement here you guys are truly a rock.  Today I will not drink with you SD.

Interesting quote...Great description of your personal work!  Wow!  Good Stuff!..For me I'd rewrite the quote to state:  "Fear and anxiety grow as I *Avoid* the truth"..I'm not afraid of the truth but rather one category of my fears is related to the "uncertainty of the future" when I accept certain truths...Not drinking with you today!
