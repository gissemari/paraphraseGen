A little backstory I had a massive panic attacking Saturday night and because I was drunk had to call my folks to talk me down. They called 911 and the cops came and got me and brought me to a hospital. I just got out of a behavior health unit yesterday and the doctors told me I need to quit drinking because my liver is fucked and the meds they put me on could possibly cause an accidental overdose. my dad came and got me packed my apartment up and is taking me home to my parents house to get my mind straight. I explained to my dad how bad my drinking had got and he understands because alcoholism runs in his family bad. To get to the point Im in this Penske moving truck with him and I really feel like I'm dying. I can't see straight and I am cold sweating and feel sick. How long is this suppose to last? Is there anything  I can do? Any help is appreciated I'm sorry if none of this makes sense because I'm struggling while I'm typing this on my phone.

Have you not had a drink since Saturday?
