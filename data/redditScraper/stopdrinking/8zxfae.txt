I've been sober for two and a half months since graduating from college (I owe it to staying with my parents this summer and not my own self control). I start my first job next week and I will be studying for masters school part time so I've really got a nice setup.   That said I have felt the urge gnawing at me and I just caught myself looking up a low carb margarita recipe(it took me bookmarking it to snap out of it and realize what I was doing)...I need to get a handle on this if I want to seize these opportunities.  I know I can resist weekday drinking but I'm not sure about Friday or Saturday nights. It's a struggle between the part of me that wants to delay gratification and seek out the reward of a healthier life and the part that seeks instant gratification because I'm independent and able to do whatever I want. Ironically that part of me keeps forgetting how much hangovers suck...I can tell that this battle is far from over.

Good job on catching yourself out. The way you describe things made me think that you're sitting in your spartan bedroom eschewing all pleasures in life and only concentrating on the wholesome pursuits of self-improvement study and work. I'm sure my impression is wrong. What do you do for fun? ..There's nothing wrong with instant gratification as long as we don't harm ourselves with it. Today my husband and I cut each others' hair (my hair-do is pretty radical and I love it; we both feel better about our appearance). Soon we're off to watch a mother duck tuck her ducklings in for the night. Then we're having one of our favourite dishes for dinner and finally we're having a giant pineapple for pudding. Nice things + no harm = good mood so no void to fill.
same. I keep thinking of future things I maybe want to drink at. I don't know...it's a real bitch.
