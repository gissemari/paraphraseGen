I went to my therapist today and she encouraged me to start writing down irrational thoughts I have especially about drinking and then vocalizing them with someone else so I'm not just bottling them up. I don't have anyone I trust with this available for a phone call right now so I'm posting here instead since I know you all could probably relate:..I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed thinking about relapsing - not necessarily today but some time in "the future" however close or far off that may be. ..The other side of that is that I'm having a lot of feelings today about how much more positive things are when I abstain from drinking. I have had a positive past few days meeting my new work team and I was really impressed with myself for coming out of my shell a little bit around them and actually contributing to what we were working on...So to end this post does anyone have any tips for staying focused on "just today"? It can be very difficult for me at times to focus on just one day at a time so for anyone that has experienced those same feelings what have you found helpful in terms of concentrating on one day and not the enormity of "the future"?

I would try to trick myself. As weird as that sounds. I'd tell myself you can totally drink tomorrow if you feel like it. But not today. If I can get through today maybe I'll drink tomorrow. And when tomorrow comes I'm always thankful I didn't drink the day before. It kind of gives me a little kick start like that wasn't SO bad. Let's do it again today. ..I hope this helps. I wish you all the best  ..I will not drink with you today
