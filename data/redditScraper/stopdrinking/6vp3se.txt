Relapsed yesterday. Nothing bad happened in fact I hooked up with a girl I've been pining over for a month or so. Know that what I did was wrong but I'll be honest I don't care yet. Thoughts?

Why did you stop drinking in the first place? 
Not saying this is true for you but it is for me. When I relapse the issues don't pop up at first. In fact it feels like I can  handle it and it will make my life better. ..I then continue making bad choices which can go on for years and end with my life in shambles. 
I always feel indifferent right after a relapse and basically defend it to myself (denial) but then he next few weeks are like a reverse movie of the days I've been sober. 
If you're happy go for it.  They are *your* choices.  I support you.
&gt;Know that what I did was wrong but I'll be honest I don't care yet...This is precisely the type of thing my Lizard Brain would say to me. And it contradicts itself. If I know it's wrong it's because I care. ..Anyway congrats on 432 days - that's awesome. Hope you sort things out. 
Don't fool yourself it's a VERY slippery slope. My last bender was preceded by me having just a few one night. I literally said out loud " I don't think 2 beers is going to make me relapse" wrong! A week later a few beers then back into the rum right back to the nasty part of my habit.
