And every night I pray tomorrow I will have the fortitude to take on the next siege...It seems alcoholism is a constant disease. Even after 7 months without a drop of alcohol I struggle with depression anxiety and failing relationships that trigger me making me want to drink. It becomes a daily struggle the only thing that matters for me is the fact I never make that one step to get in my car and go booze it up. ..There was a time when it was the opposite. I would always want to stop but I never got around to it. Now it's as if I always kinda want to drink again- but I never get around to actually doing it. It's okay. I have fun without booze. I date without booze. I don't need it fight my wars anymore. Before it would just cause a truce that day only to lose tomorrow. Now I win by fighting these urges day by day.

Having a therapist and the support of peers in AA lessened my loneliness depression and anxiety.
