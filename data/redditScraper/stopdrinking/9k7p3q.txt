Thanks to all of you who post in here I didn't blow close to 100 days of sobriety.  Met some odd people had an overall weird night and just wanted to escape.  Went through all the  justifications' of why a couple shots to chill out wouldn't hurt and settled on reading SD and a hot bath.  So happy to wake up with a headache from a cold rather than the heartache of letting alcohol trick me into believing it has any new answers to life's problems.  Thanks for listening and sharing your stories of struggles and successes.  It really does help us all.

I'm happy you made it through. Its those times that test my commitment that mean the most to me later on. When I had a dozen reasons to drink and put my sobriety ahead of all of them. I do't know what the future holds but I'm damn proud of the victories over not drinking and you should too. I wish you the best. IWNDWYT..
