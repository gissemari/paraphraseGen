I'm a 17 year old girl and my drinking has definitely gotten out of hand. Growing up I saw both of my parents struggle with drinking problems &amp; I remember hating the way it made them so much and thinking to myself that I would never drink..Then just after I turned 15 I started drinking with my friends at parties. It was only a few drinks once every month or so just because I wanted to feel included.  .For the past year or so its getting to the point where im drunk at least 5 times a week and it's getting progressively worse. I'm scared of who I'm becoming and I know I need to stop. I'm ruining my life..It's started affecting my performance at school and there's a big chance I'm going to lose my scholarship to my dream university and without that I won't be able to afford to go next year. .I've said I'm gonna stop drinking so many times now but I always mess up within like 2 or 3 days and end up drunk again..Last night I got more drunk than I have ever been before and I've been beating myself up for it all day I feel so ashamed. I hardly remember anything but from what my friends have told me I was just incredibly friendly but very obnoxious I just hate that I can't remember anything. I also busted up both of my knees my elbows and 3 of my fingers. .I know I need to stop before it gets anymore out of control but I'm so scared to and I don't know how.

The fact that you are thinking about this so early is truly amazing.  Alcoholism is progressive and alcohol is addictive!  I wish I would have known this sooner.  Try listening to Rachel Hart's "take a break" podcast.  It's like free therapy.  It has episodes on how to deal with shame from drinking urges etc.  Good luck!  Hope you stick around!
I too was apprehensive about quitting.  Keep putting it off making excuses I didn't like myself I realized no one can do this for me do one day I simply did it.  I'll tell you it honestly was easy for me.  I know that isn't always the case and my sincere compassion goes to everyone who struggles.   I'm hoping you will find it easy like me.  I've got my energy back I'm looking so much better physically but the absolute best thing is the joy and laughter that are now a part of each and every day.
