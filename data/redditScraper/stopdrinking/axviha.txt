Hello fellow abstainers! ..We assemble here in SD from all over the world to tackle a common problem be it to help  .ourselves or to help a loved one who is battling with alcoholism. But because we all come from  .many different places I just wanted to compare some experiences and treatment options which  .are available to you in your part of the world. I understand that the vast majority of  .subscribers on SD are from The States but it would be interesting to compare what the  .experience is like for individuals who are seeking help in their part of the world...The reason why I am bringing this up is because medical approaches medication availability and  .pricing vary from country to country as well as types of support networks available. For  .example one medication or treatment pathway may be more popular in Europe while the other  .seems to be more popular in The States. There may be a lack of government subsidies in place  .preventing access to particular medicines or services in your part of the world or health  .insurance related obstacles...Who was your first point of contact on your way of recovery? Was it your General Practitioner or  .a Drug and Alcohol Clinic? Which medications are you taking if any and why? And which pathways  .to recovery were offered to you? ..*Quick background info about me:* I am Australian. Don't have private health insurance. Have been a heavy drinker for the past several  .Years. Approximately 35 units of alcohol a day for the past 2 years. Tried to get sober twice.  .After my first attempt relapsed after 3 weeks of sobriety. Currently on my second attempt. Sober  .for 80 days...When I began treatment all I heard from doctors was the paramount importance of Vitamin B1  .(Thiamine) and Vitamin B12 injections (cyanocobalamin). These were the first port of call to  .prevent neurological damage to your body which occurs with ongoing alcohol abuse due to alcohol  .flushing vitamin B out of your system for a prolonged period of time. Vitamin B1 was a one off  .injection and Vitamin B12 was injected over the course of the first two weeks on three  .occasions. I have not come across too many mentions of vitamin B intake on SD...Along with Vitamin B Valium (benzodiazepine) was prescribed to help manage withdrawals and to  .help prevent delirium and seizures which are a risk during the first week of detoxing with the  .dose gradually reduced to zero by the end of week one. ..After a week on Valium which was incredibly difficult the following three options were offered  .to me by my GP with an explanation of how they work on your body and why they were or were not  .suitable for my specific situation as well as the price of the drug (Under the Australian  .Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme [PBS]): ..**Antabuse** (Disulfiram) [Australian Price: $85AUD ($60USD/ 53EUR)] - Makes your body more  .sensitive to ethanol and impacts its ability to metabolize it thereby making you feel  .horribly ill if you drink. Because this particular drug does nothing to reduce alcohol cravings  .but rather acts as a somewhat drastic deterrent from alcohol consumption this wasn't a very  .suitable option for me...**Naltrexone** (a.k.a. ReVia and Vivitrol) [Australian Price: $40AUD ($29USD/ 25EUR)] - Works by  .blocking opioid receptors in the body thereby diminishing the high which a person gets from  .alcohol and reduces alcohol cravings. Due to the poor state which my liver was in at the time of  .my liver function test this was not a suitable option for me as it could cause further damage  .to the liver.  ..**Campral** - (Acamprosate) [Australian Price: $49AUD ($35USD/ 31EUR)] - Works by stabilising the  .chemical signals in the brain which are disrupted by the effects of alcohol withdrawal symptoms  .once the person has stopping drinking. Also works to minimise alcohol cravings. Ideally should  .be taken while undergoing some sort of drug and alcohol counselling...Seeing as Naltrexone was not allowed due to the state of my liver and Antabuse did not diminish  .cravings instead making you feel ill if you drank Campral was the best option for me  .considering that I wanted to stop drinking completely was already undergoing counseling and  .needed something to help with the craving aspect of recovery. A single box of Campral contains  .180 tablets and my prescribed dosage was 6 tablets a day three times a day after food. It took  .about  5 days for the drug to kick in and although it can be quite cumbersome taking this many  .pills a day once I got into the rhythm of it it became part of my daily routine. 180 tablets  .later my doctor recommended that I reduce the dose to 4 tablets a day. One thing about Campral  .is that it is not recommended that you stop taking it altogether but slowly reduce the dosage  .over time which I am in the process of doing....Some side effects which I experienced while taking Campral was diarrhoea joint pain and pretty  .much a complete loss of sex drive. The latter being the most frustrating side effect but given  .the fact that the tablets seemed to be helping I was willing to put up with it. Since lowering  .the dose to 4 tablets a day my joints are not as sore the diarrhoea is almost gone and the sex  .drive is gradually starting to return...What has your experience been like? Which avenues have you taken on your road to recovery and why? Have you gone cold turkey or are you using medication? Have you tried more than one type of medication and has it worked for you? .
