Now I'm not saying I don't struggle at times with cravings dealing with stressful situations etc. But I can say that nothing bad has happened to be since I quit. No pills no weed hardly any cigarettes not a drop of booze and highly motivated. I know I have another drunk in me but I don't know if I have another sober...bad: started with a 2nd dui had a bad breakup had a shittier friendship with said person from breakup haven't been able to drive in 3 months has been a little rough luckily i'm near public transit and have an amazing roommate+friends was super overweight due to drinking chased unhealthy relationships..now: about to get my license back within the week lost about 50 lbs met a lot of new friends that share similar mindsets have an amazing job opportunity coming up am selective and more careful when looking at relationships (romantic or otherwise)..Never thought I'd be able to do it at the beginning but I did. There is definitely hope for those looking to quit. Things definitely do improve as you progress. Thanks to /r/stopdrinking some AA (found going too much to not be for me) new friends (many from AA) that shared the same fight and so many more. I know it's still something I have to deal with for the rest of my life but I now have the tools to handle it. I'm one slip up from becoming full blown fucked up again so that definitely keeps me grounded. Keep up the good work everyone!..I keep this [album](http://imgur.com/a/RPlgL) as a reminder of where I was and where I'm going.
