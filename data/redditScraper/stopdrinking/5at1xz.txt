A month ago I committed to one month sober. Getting it all in check re-assessing my habits. It only took me a few days to realise I need more than a month. I took the days one at a time and turned down drinks with ease far often than with struggles after the first week. Since then I've regained some clarity (although I have a ways to go) let go of some grief (although I have a ways to go... I'd started drinking again when grieving a rather painful loss) and regained the perspective I'd gained the last time I quit for around 100 days.  I have healed far more these past 30 days than I ever could have with a glass of wine in hand (read: bottle.. or box..). One thing I do know is that when drinking I lose my clarity and I gain a great deal of numbness. I gain a mountain of unfelt feelings and in that I lose myself. My true self that is....Today I recommit to another 30 days. I''m hoping to gain more clarity let go of more grief and hopefully lose the extra pounds I've gained since quitting drinking and taking up junk food! :) Time to get to that yoga mat and into those running shoes. ...Soda water cheers folks. Thank you for all of your stories and for sharing of yourselves. You help me far more than you know. I will not drink with you today. :) ..Edit: Typo
