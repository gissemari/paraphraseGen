A little background I am in the "starting to quit but keep relapsing" stage. I'm doing it on my own right now. I was drinking mostly vodka somewhere between a pint to 750ml on average per day mixing it with soda and juices. I rarely drink beer or wine unless in social settings...I know some of you are in that place where you either don't or can't go to rehab. I've seen people lose their jobs and spouses when that happens so I know it's scary. Some of you also are probably like me 6 months ago drinking every day and asking yourself "Am I an alcoholic?" Somehow you landed here and you want to learn more...Keep in mind this: while we're all different chances are you share **a lot** in common with addicts that is of course if you are in fact an addict. I came to that conclusion on my own without anyone telling me. I have an addictive personality...I have found this subreddit to be pretty much the most anonymous way to handle the situation of having a drinking problem. There are advantages (avoiding embarrassment with people in real life; having confidence to share your story with complete strangers) and disadvantages (a certain lack of accountability; getting the proper help) to keep in mind...With that said I encourage the lurkers (me 6 months ago) and those handling the first days (me a couple times the past 2 months) with how I went about it...-**While lurking**: I learned so much about my problem. But I didn't ever actually face it until I was basically "caught" by my girlfriend and my parents when I was shaky and looked like a mess. However I can't tell you just how much easier it was to accept the problem and not make up some excuse that would sound like bullshit. I immediately opened up that I was drinking too much. If I wasn't lurking here and reading stories every day from people my knowledge of the subject would probably have pushed my addict brain to make up lies and only further damage my relationships with the closest people in my life. I would have just kept drinking and who knows what far worse things could have happened in my life. ..-**The relapsing**: yeah it happens. Not to everyone but it does to me. It also happens to a lot of people posting here. This is why I highly recommend getting a badge if you haven't already. Don't feel too bad that you ask for a reset. No one is judging you. The badge isn't for others here (although we have mad respect for those with years and decades under their belt). THE BADGE IS FOR YOU. ..The first time I tried to go sober and post here very morning I didn't have a badge. Next thing you know I'm not checking in and I'm not thinking about my number of days sober. I was just doing what addicts do: going back to drinking. ..Well of course that didn't solve anything and I went back to being that guy hiding my addiction. "I hope they don't notice I'm shaky." "I'm not too drunk to go to the store and get another bottle." "If I just buy half of what I normally do that's not bad. I can taper if need be."..Nope. It doesn't work at least not for me. So this go around I'm giving myself a goal of 30 days without one drop of alcohol and see how it goes from there. I quit cold turkey (like I did previous times) and now I'm on Day 3. I already feel 10 times better than Day 1 but still have a long way to go. ..-**Day 1**: I went to bed the night before knowing that I was going to try sobriety again. I made sure that I didn't have anything to do that day (but I did manage to log in here ask for a badge reset and commit to not drinking). I was able to lay in bed for most of the morning and drink a lot of water. I tried to eat food but nope. That didn't work. Sure enough I'm in the bathroom throwing up. Still though more water. Some Gatorade. Even if food wasn't my friend I stayed hydrated. I even went for a little walk just to sweat a little out but didn't push myself. Also taking a shower helps get the toxins on your skin out a little. I spent most of the afternoon lying down as well. Despite my body craving alcohol and feeling like crap the thing keeping me determined to not drink was knowing how much I loved Day 6 when I first tried to quit. ..By the evening time I was able to eat a little bit. My sleep pattern was horrific. I would wake up about every hour and then slowly fall back to sleep. This didn't ruin Day 2 but I certainly didn't want to wake up early the next day. ..-**Day 2**: My oh my I still feel like crap but noticeably better than Day 1. Logged into here and committed to not drinking. By the time I was up and ready to start my day it was time to get lunch. I managed to eat about half the normal serving but hey that was more than dinner. When the mid-afternoon rolled around snack time! By dinner time I was continuing to eat small meals. A couple hours before bed time I'm eating the rest of my lunch with a salad. Also drinking a lot of water the entire day. ..At one point I managed to go to the grocery store and load up on salty and healthy snacks along with more Gatorade and supplies for lunches and dinners. I'm one of those drinkers who neglects eating. I naturally have a high metabolism but the alcohol definitely muted that over the past couple of years. ..And you can bet your butt that I went through Day 2 thinking about drinking most of the day. Not that I was tempted though. It's just the thought kept popping in my head. Well guess what? By the evening time when normally I'm waist deep in a bottle of booze I was painting my hallway (a chore I have neglected) and listening to music. And yes the thought of drinking kept popping up but my reaction every time was "If I was drinking I wouldn't be able to get this done." That sense of accomplishment got me through the night...That is all. I hope this helps...*(NOTE: please take this with a grain of salt. It's my experience. By no means is this what I recommend for everyone here. Our mental statuses might be similar but our bodies and consumption levels are not. Seeking professional help by vising a hospital or clinic might be your best option).*

Great post and congratulations on 2 full sober days and waking up not hungover today! It's a great feeling :)..I really liked your comments for lurkers about relapsing and the badge. It truly is for you and no one here is judging anyone because we've all had to start somewhere and it really does take practice for most of us to get on the right track and stick to it.  ..However I just wanted to add that I have mad respect for anyone that has 1 day or 1 week or any time and takes the opportunity to share not just those with years or decades.  Other people's posts and struggles and support have helped me so much and I hope some day my shares can help too even if it's just one nugget or comment that helps one person just a little...This truly is a great community...Best wishes
Good post. Today's day 4 for me. Resistant to getting a badge for some reason but I'll consider it more after what you wrote re: it being for yourself. 
for me one of my relapse mechanisms was "patting myself on the back with a sixpack"  for  "being good"  for X days of not drinking - eventually i figured out it was a negative reward and was able to stop doing it.  ..perhaps it applies...
Thanks for posting this. I'm a long-time lurker and occasional poster who pretty much exactly fits the bill for what you're describing. I've not yet gotten a badge. I can go a couple days without drinking but that's it. I'm still rationalizing my decisions to return to the bottle and not take a hard stand. Congratulations of your renewed efforts and thanks for aiming this at 'beginners'. 
This post could have been written by me. I'm on day 5. I finally was able to eat food on day 4 and I'm sleeping a bit better. The sweats are slowing down too. ..It helps to hear someone dealing with the same problems. You are right about everything you wrote. It seems trivial but getting that badge and posting here every day... it's actually doing something about it. Congratulations and keep it up. Hopefully we will both be posting here every day for a long time while our badges rack up.

Thanks for sharing this! These types of posts are always important as I'm sure it answers a lot of the 'beginning' questions. Glad you got through it welcome aboard :).
My experience is that the implication that relapse is inevitable is dangerous.  And I'm someone who has been trying to get sober for the past four years via various methods.  I had to get over several layers of self-delusion.  Practice makes perfect but unless you are practicing with the assumption that long term abstinence is the goal you're just postponing eventually coming to that realization.  Sorry none of us are that special...The 30-day rule is a relic from Moderation Management.  Setting a deadline virtually guarantees you will slip again.  Basically you're telling yourself that a little drinking is "ok" as long as you're "trying."  I don't mean you should beat the shit out of yourself if a relapse happens.  But there's a reason AA (which I don't subscribe to except for support) says "One day at a time."
