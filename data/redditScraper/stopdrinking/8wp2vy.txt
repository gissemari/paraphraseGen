Got hit with cravings today especially tonight. Pretty sure they had something to do with helping the local brewer with some work around his house earlier. Either way going to the diner to fill up on food. That was close. Be well. I will not drink with you tonight good people. Thanks for lending an ear I appreciate it.

A heavy dose of sweets got me through a lot of cravings. I keep chocolate in the cabinets still for just this reason...Congrats on 9!
