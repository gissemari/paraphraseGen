I'm walking my dog this morning after she woke me up 30 minutes early and I'm telling her "you better be glad I'm not hungover..." which is 100% true! I would have been the grumpiest ever but I got a great night's sleep and am ready for Friday. I still have my struggles and am taking it hour by hour but am just glad I'm fully committed to sticking to it and have a great support system. What are you happy about on this Friday?

Happy Friday! I'm happy that I've been sober for 60 days today! :)
Happy Friday! I am glad you are having a great sober day. I have actually become a morning person in my sobriety as well. Never thought that would happen. ..I am happy because it is Friday and I have some fun planned for the weekend some cycling and a poker game. I also have [Rock Candy Funk Party](https://youtu.be/n3_d3yqvnJw) playing here at work and you just cant feel bad with funk music playing.
Congrats. Happy Friday to you. I am looking forward to not drinking tonight and being able to sleep in tomorrow as i have no work on Saturday 
Glad to hear it! Hope you have a great day!
