Not literally old actually my age just haven't seen her for years. Friend boss co-worker. All of the above for many years in a high stress job. Just found out she died of cancer a few days ago (non-drinking related as far as I know)...While I've been struggling to not drink struggling to learn to live she was  just struggling to live. ..Life is Too.Fucking.Short. to waste it drunk out of your mind. Normally I would commemorate something like this with a good drunk. Instead? How about a walk outside in the sunlight and some good old fashioned crying. Some emotion might feel good.

People are dying left and right in my old hometown and they are only around 30 years old.  I agree life is too short to spend it in a self hating stupor.  
Sorry to hear it. 
&gt;Life is Too.Fucking.Short. to waste it drunk out of your mind...Wise words.
Emotions don't always feel good...I think what feels good about emotions for me is this ability to express them. Just being able to cry and be sad about something is a big step for me. Instead of going "Oh something bad happened I'll drink to that" I can sit there and say "I am sad about this and need to talk to someone about it"..This is a huge step for you. Congrats on doing the right thing and not picking up.
