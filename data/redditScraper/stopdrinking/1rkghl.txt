It was the best thing I've done for myself ever...Struggle: Nothing to report this week...General chat: It's looking a lot like xmas out there this morning...Have a great 24 hours folks!
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph: My last lapse reinforced for me how little joy I get from drinking nowadays.  It's been a few days since I had a half glass of wine (couldn't finish it) and I'm looking forward to spending thanksgiving with my largely abstinent family...Struggle: Sick.  Fever is gone for now but I still sound like a sea lion when I cough...General Chat: decided to blow off work today to nurse my cough.  Hoping to get some quality XBOX time..
The turkey lurks...This is hurricane season for many of us with families and other nostalgic anxieties arriving day and night...Stay strong if you are in aa find an alcathon they can save you from your family if only to give you a break.....
It's snowing here too. Really quite lovely.
Hump Day! Which is great because food tomorrow trip with family Friday and the weekend afterwards...Triumph: I just realized it's been over 2 weeks for me now. I've also been progressing fairly well through LazyFoo's SDL tutorials...Struggle: Trying to get a regular schedule going wake up at the same time get to sleep at roughly the same times. Not going too well...General: Last night I rediscovered Joe Hisaishi's music if you like classical/soundtracks I highly highly recommend giving it a listen.
Man 507. Congratulations on that. That's a huge number.
Triumph: Settled a legal case that threatened my business and livelihood. Instead I negotiated a resolution to a problem that has weighed heavy for over 10 years. Gettin' sober helped get me here...Struggle: Many other things but am deciding to enjoy the triumph for a few days. ..Chat: Friday the day after Thanksgiving is my favorite day of the year. It's not a holiday not a work day (for me) and... the weekend is still ahead. It's like a free bonus day. (And I don't go shopping.)
**Triumph**: Life dude.  I am just enjoying the crap out of it.  The weather's been pretty crappy lately so I've started going to more Krav Maga classes (since I can't cycle or play tennis).  My wife and I are getting along better than ever.  Work is going exceptionally well.  I couldn't be happier.  And I owe it all to not drinking...**Struggle**: See above...**General chat**: We're hosting our first Thanksgiving dinner.  We'll have 11 people (including my wife and I).  We've done it for four people before but 11 is huge (to us).  We're excited...Have a good one everyone!  Be strong be sober.
Triumph: I didn't drink the alcohol my parents keep in the house last night. Even though the idea of swilling wine alone in the dark was quite appealing. (I'm a weirdo.)..Struggle: I really don't enjoy being home with my family very much. Normally I would have added liqueur to my coffee this morning and would  already be in the process of getting drunk by now now (its 10 am). There's no meeting in thus town until 7:30 pm. WTF is that about?!..General Chatter: I hate the holidays and I want to go home. 
Oooh I've been looking forward to being able to participate in one of these!..**Triumph**: Tuesday evenings were previously the night I would get loaded by myself with no boundaries (read: nobody around to see just how much I was drinking) while my fella was out gaming with his friends. I knew I would be tempted last night so I set myself up with a new packet of tea a couple of pre-chosen Netflix movies and all of the supplies to do my nails. In bed by 11 and not a drop of booze passed this lips. Great success...**Struggle**: Still having trouble sleeping but that's to be expected and seems to be getting better each day. My brain will learn how to go to bed without having to pass out from alcohol soon enough. Waking up without a hangover is *amazing*! ..**General chat**: My boyfriend is all moved into my apartment now and I love it. My shelves are filled with books I have never read before and I can't wait to make my way through them. As well after a few years of living alone I can't believe the difference a "roommate" is going to make to my budget. I hadn't thought much about the financial aspect until now but between having my bills cut in half and all of the money I am saving by not buying liquor there is so much wiggle room to pay off my student debt a little more quickly and start saving for things like vacations and (eventually) a house of our own. Pretty rad if you ask me!..Happy Wednesday everyone!
Triumph: I decided to make a change. Haven't had a drink at all since Saturday night/Sunday morning...Struggle: Cravings it's been on my mind constantly...General chat: My new job confirmed that my documentation has all been processed; now I'm just waiting for a start date. Big motivator to commit to this as it feels like it could be a new start.
Triumph: Went to a Thanksgiving party w/ friends over the weekend and didn't drink AND gave a drunk friend a ride  so I came out with the net positive of one favor owed to me :)..Struggle: Work is pretty "meh" right now. ..General Chat: I was listening to NPR this morning and they talked about making whipped cream with maple syrup  I am definitely going to try that for pumpkin pie topping!
