Hi! I am in the midst of a two-week relapse and I'm making a plan to break it today...I work until 10. That is when the grocery store closes. I usually hotfoot it to the grocery store at the end of my shift and grab some beer. Tonight I will tell a coworker/friend that I do this and ask if he will be kind enough to drive me home to keep me from doing it again. ..I feel shame and self-loathing today. I want to have a structured life. I can't do that while I'm drinking. But I don't have optimism about the future so that makes it hard not to drink. Grrr... Thanks for letting me vent.
