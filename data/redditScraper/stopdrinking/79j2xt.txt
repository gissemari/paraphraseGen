So I relapsed and have been drinking every night since 18th October. I knew what was happening but just fell back into it after a few rows with my other half...Anyway here I am happily not drinking with you all today.

Seems like you've had a several slips for very similar reasons...What do you plan to do differently this time?
Hi Scott!..I had the same thing happening over and over again a year ago...Found out that it was me using alcohol to mask or try to shove away fear and anger - and my codependency issues..For me I had to look at what I could and couldn't control and let go of the rest...I also decided to not let my life go to chaotic shambles "because of" my sig other (which it wasn't forcing me to drink - I was choosing to react by drinking)..If nothing changes nothing changes amirite?..So what's next? Very glad you are here not drinking with us today..:) :) .
That makes sense thank you.
