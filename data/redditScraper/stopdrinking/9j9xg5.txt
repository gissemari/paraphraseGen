By some miracle I didn't drink today. I even drove to the  beer store  and parked the truck. I sat there for a solid three minutes before I said out loud  this is not who I want to be  before I turned the truck back on and drove home. ..I'm in the midst of a divorce and had a series of triggering texts and phone calls. It made me realize that I've turned to alcohol every time I get irritated angry or sad. I don't want to be that person anymore. It's time to feel feelings again...I started a blog a few days ago and I want to become the person that I am trying to become. I want to write about how proud I am of myself or how I kept from drinking or how I actually did wake up and go for a jog one morning. I want to go camping and not spend the week boozing it up. I want to hike. I don't want to blog about how I struggled to wake up get my kids to the bus stop and stumble back to the bathroom to vomit before getting ready for work...

I'd marry you
Well done! Personally I find it impossible to turn back after I've already made the decision to go to the store. You were so strong!! IWNDWYT
I think you can now write a page in that blog. You have every right to feel proud after the sober victory at the store. Harvey Mackay said..."Good habits are as addictive as bad habits and a lot more rewarding." Hope you can continue to build good habits. Stay strong &amp; Sober on! I will NOT drink with you today!  Peace
Nice work! Yep feeling the feels is uncomfortable but so rewarding in the long run. Share a link to your blog if you want!
Awesome stuff. Sounds like you're on your way!
