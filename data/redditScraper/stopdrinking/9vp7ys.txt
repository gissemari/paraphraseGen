The last one came from boredom. Started last night after the one that came from not being able to slow down. Crack is still growing. The other ones from last week were not being able to get outside myself and wanting to not care about little mistakes or anything in general...I feel very close to giving in. Like hours close. My thinking is kinda blurry so my list for not drinking:..- people don't like it when I drink: I live with my nephew and I think it confuses him how I can be so different and how other people start to avoid me and I them..- it never solves anything. I keep telling myself this but that is getting pretty useless after so many times over the last few weeks..- not drinking is the only thing I'm proud of but I am very proud of it..- for my mom. For my mom's mom who passed last year. But would she hate me if I did this? She understands..- for productivity and knowing it'll make me useless tomorrow and the next day..- for worrying if I text people or call people or god forbid I go out in public or interact with people..- for my sobriety date...I'm telling myself that I am not an alcoholic that I'm safe and I don't leave the house that I do it alone and that I'm sure I won't keep going this time. ..As far as meetings I may be wrong but I just haven't established a routine there or any friendships so going there doesn't feel like it's going to help. ..If this feeling hadn't lasted so long I'd be ok. I have talked myself out of it so many times now and the weather is just right and the timing is working against me with a few things: I don't want to be around people and yet I don't want to be alone. That means get   in my book. ..It doesn't even seem that important. One guy gets drunk at home on a Friday night in nowhere USA. Why is there such a struggle? Why struggle just do what I want this time..

The struggle only ended for me when I kept going one day at a time.  Most days I don't struggle.  I'm free.  If I drink I'm guaranteed to struggle again.   That is the number one reason why I don't drink again...There is hope!  Keep going.  One day at a time was a struggle at first but it led to freedom for me.  I'm sending positive thoughts your way!
