2017 has been a really rough year for me and I haven't experienced anything like this. There were several deaths that really shook me in the beginning and it still haunts me. I tried to get back together with my ex but failed. Hearing about politics is depressing. ..I hadn't realized how much emotion I was suppressing with alcohol and now that I'm sitting with it I'm realizing how fucking sad I've been. I'm confident I'll push through over time and alcohol actually seems less appealing than ever right now. ..I have a few big things going on in my life right now that is quite the struggle but in the end the pros outweigh the cons and I have much to be thankful for. But man I'm going through a really hard time right now. Thanks for letting me vent and here's to not drinking today!

I hope things ease up for you and can definitely relate on the struggles. Alcohol could be a temporary pain relief but as soon as it was gone the pain definitely increased. Keep strong because you are definitely on the right path. I will not drink with you today.
