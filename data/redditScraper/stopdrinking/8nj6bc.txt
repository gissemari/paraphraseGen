This is the second longest I have ever been off the booze. My longest time is 8 months and at that point I decided to drink again I walked out of my apartment almost on auto pilot and walked to the store bought a bottle and drank it while sitting on my couch because I was "stressed"...I continued this relapse for months not even caring to stop drinking. I went from small bottles to large then back to small but buying multiple times a day. I eventually got to a point where the drinking had taken over again where I would stop drinking in the night with a bit left in the bottle for the next day to help me get through the mornings...I have no been off and clear for 5 months as I said and this time I really feel like I have no need for the booze I feel good all day I no longer wake up and need that drink from the bottle to keep me from feeling pain and to get through the day. ..I work from home so drinking during the day was something I could get away with I am ashamed to say that I was working under the influence and since then am just so thankful for everything. ..This subreddit is my meeting the people here are part of my fellowship and I will not drink today. I hope you find the strength to do the same the wisdom to know what you can't change and the ability to make the changes you need to make. ..Thank you all for the constant support knowing you aren't special that others have had issue and that we can make it back from where we are gave me strength to work through all I had done while a bottle was in my hand.
