Hi guys if this is the wrong place to post this I would be more than happy to remove it and post it in the appropriate place. I have a friend who has a serious alcohol problem as in he can't go a few hours without drinking and has been stealing almost everyday in order to continue drinking. I feel so frustrated and unable to help. I don't know what to do at all. I know that I can't fix him or take his problems away from him but does anyone have any suggestions on how I can be there to support him?  Its also taking a toll on me emotionally because I just want to see him live the life that he deserves. I thought there would be no one better to ask then people who are also struggling with alcohol addiction - I know from my own experience with addiction that its different for everyone but what do you wish your friends/family had done for you? If anyone has anything to say that I might find useful please do share

My go to saying when it comes to things like this is:..I'm powerless over alcohol no matter who drinks it
What I've noticed is that you can't help someone until they're ready. I've had friends and family try supporting me for years but I just wasn't ready for change. Being forced or coerced into sobriety never worked for me. This time it was my decision and it actually feels real...All I can suggest is to try to empathize sympathize care &amp; be a listening ear. 
One thing I've found helpful sometimes is to offer to attend a recovery meeting with the person and sit and be support for them.
