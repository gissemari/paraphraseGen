I first want to thank all of the supportive and encouraging members of this sub.  You continue to help me through one of the biggest challenges of my life...Secondly here's to six months 100% alcohol free!  April 9th was the last time I drank.  First time I've done that since I began drinking as a teenager.  For context I'm 46...I did one AA meeting (bought the book and found a sponsor as a backup) and then read Allen Carr's "The Easy Way To Stop Drinking" and worked hard in therapy to admit and concede to my problem...I hit my own version of rock bottom but fortunately I wasn't physically dependent (yet) on alcohol.  I was well on the path but I decided to make the tough decision and get sober and admit that I was an alcoholic and that I'd only get worse...It has been difficult for sure.  4 months into sobriety I was fired from my job of 15 years at one of the most successful fortune 500 companies in the country.  Thought I'd work there for the rest of my career.  I was scared shitless so angry at everyone and everything (mostly myself).  But I didn't drink...I used cannabis for the first 3 months to help but decided that I needed to stop that as well because it wasn't helping with my depression...Really glad to be 100% sober now.  I feel so much better and my depression is manageable now.  I can recognize it and work through it...The depression was getting so bad with drinking and pot... ..I never thought I'd become an alcoholic I thought I was above it and strong enough to never get that bad.  I quit pot for about 8 years once before because I thought that was my problem.  Then I ended up becoming an alcoholic as I traded one addiction for another.  Addiction has always been an issue be it pot alcohol or cocaine.  I was always the one pushing those envelopes.  High tolerance to all of the above and would hit it harder than anyone else around...The functional type... kept my job (until recently) my mortgage and my family.  I was the confident man keeping appearances up and then some.  Athletic and in good shape talented with music and technology great job beautiful wife and family...But I risked it all for my addictions and mainly alcohol in the end.  Hiding the whiskey bottles sneaking off to the bar whenever I could justify and get away with it...Tried moderation for 2 years and said if I couldn't get it working then I had to quit cold turkey...Here I am 6 months sober from alcohol 3 months off pot...I've got a new job now that I'm really enjoying.  Worst part of it: they all drink like fish.  Full fridge of beer there everyday and bottles of spirits (all the types I loved) in the row next to me sitting atop my coworkers desks...I made it clear from the day I started that I DON'T DRINK PERIOD.  Talk about turning a new leaf.  That was not easy and I'd be lying if I said I don't struggle sometimes often...They don't know what it's like.  Most of them are to young to know where they are heading and I hope they never get there...I'm making it through the hardest part of the year even made it through the company Christmas party which was at a Winery (of course!)...This is the new me and drinking is not a part of my life anymore and I'm doing so much better...Alcohol made it easy for me to avoid and not deal with my problems and allowed them to fester.  The biggest lie it let me live was thinking I liked my job of 15 years.  I hated that place and most everyone I worked with.  But yet I had myself convinced I'd be there forever.  That's what alcoholism does to you.  You can't see the forest for the trees.  ..Life is full of new potential and possibilities now and I can begin to take responsibility for the past present and future...This is one of my first reddit post and the first under this account.  I just want to help and encourage others to make this tough choice and to let you know you are not alone.  There are many of us who want to help and want you to join in on a life's potential.  It is there for you and you can do it...Find the support and run to it and embrace it wherever you can find it.  I'm so fortunate to have the support of family and friends but I know many do not have that.  Reach out to your community and create new friends and family if you can.  Go to AA read books.  Keep on the path!  Your life is worth it!..We live in the American Age of Alcohol making it a particularly tough time for those on the path.  Alcohol is the new tobacco.  It can advertise freely and the marketing mavens make all those drinkers seem like the new Marlboro Man.  So calm cool and collected.  Big Alcohol can now advertise on TV just like Big Tobacco used to be able to.  In fact Big Tobacco invested in Big Alcohol because they know the game... keep them addicted and their money will be in your pocket.  Society picks up the tab while you and the investors watch your stocks grow...Pretty sick and slick business.  30 years from now just like tobacco they'll finally come clean with all the major health consequences (we can only hope) and Big Alcohol will no longer be able to sell its lies to the public...Don't let alcohol lie to you.  Be honest with yourself and be strong...Be healthy and live a fruitful life doing things for your mind body and spirit that bring happiness and longevity...One day at a time my friends!  I didn't drink today and it was another good day...Be well!

Excellent read Thank you!
I really like reading about your journey. You are a great example of the way life can be when we choose sobriety over the dark pit of addiction. I'm 20 days today and know for certain being free of alcohol is a lifestyle I want for myself and its only going to better. Thanks for sharing.  :-)
