Not sure what my badge says but today I have 60 days without a drink. The last time I relapsed I drank steadily for about a week and it started on a day that I felt ready to kill myself. I wasn't having temptations to party or socially drink I only wanted what I was feeling to go away. It of course got worse and I wish I hadn't relapsed the two times I did this year but I learned a lot. It's scary but eye-opening to see what I was using alcohol for that I was attempting to self medicate and ignore deep issues of depression and anxiety. ..I started seeing my therapist again and this time around I've been going to meetings. I never wanted to go to meetings and I still have some reservations about some of it but overall it's been really positive and it's helpful to feel like I'm not doing it alone. ..So I basically spent 80% of 2017 without drinking and being that the decade leading up to it was daily heavy drinking I am proud. I'm proud of myself that I can say I'm proud of myself! Haha sounds odd but I could not feel anything close to this just a year ago. ..Relapses happen and they suck but it's just another step towards the life you deserve not a reason to give up. No one is so cursed to have to suffer with booze forever. Believe in yourself reach out have faith...This community is great I aim to participate more often.

Congrats on your 60 days !!!
Congrats!
Amen brother! Congrats on another 60 :-)
Wow! 80% not drinking up from basically 0% not drinking? I'd say you are trending in the right direction!! Maybe next year will be 90% or 99%! I definitely believe you can do it. ..Relapses happen but there should be no shame no guilt no self-abuse. Acknowledge it understand why and make efforts to improve...IWNDWYT!
