I think it would be reasonable to say that I am a person who really struggles with drinking. It's been an issue for me for about 3 years now. With some periods off the drink completely I have been able to tell myself that I don't have a HUGE problem. A month or two here and there always proved to me that I can take it or leave it ultimately if I needed then coming back to drinking slowly and escalating into the escape hatch I use it as. ..I'm a university student (25 yo). I had quite a rough spring broke up with the girlfriend in March and to cope with all the sadness my drinking got worse almost every other day for a few weeks. Not to point of black out but drunk enough to know I have a morning after ahead...In June I realized I need to take time off from drinking so I quit for about 5 weeks. I wasn't planning on giving in but I was at a festival that I visited with my ex a couple of times and the sadness was too much to bear so I had a drink. It honestly made me feel better made me enjoy this current moment...During the summer I drank at least once or twice a week always enough to make me not care about the fact that I was a lousy dancer. I went out by myself maybe 6 times to a club to dance with girls and sure it was cool to dance with girls. I even "managed" to bring one home with me. I drove her home the next day accompanied a nasty hangover of course...After a few more nights of solitary drinking and clubbing I realized I need to take time off again. Before heading back to school I decided to take a year off of drinking. After that one year I could return to it with fresh eyes maybe this time I could even control it...So 2 days after arriving to the city I study in I decide to grab a couple of beers with my roommates. Sure it was only a couple at first because I really needed to prove myself that I'm not a problem drinker I can handle it now. During the first 2 weeks I drank a few beers every other day. Then I had a few days off...I had my first LSD trip about a month ago. It was a beautiful experience and I realized that all I'm really looking for in any drug or behavior is just to feel loved. I realized that drinking is a shortcut to it and I don't really need it. That realization didn't really stop my urges. The day after the trip I started to drink almost every day. I've never been a black out drinker again only to the point that I felt I was "drunk enough" and I knew I would sleep poorly and feel bad the next day. I carried this daily drinking on for about 2 or 3 weeks I'm not sure. ..The last week was honestly horrible. I felt so bad mentally and physically like I was about to die or something. I didn't realize why I was doing this to myself. I had to have a couple of beers at least. They did absolutely NOTHING positive for me. They only pushed any remnants of my self esteem deeper into that hole in which they already were rotting because of my drinking...Talk about my school performance during those weeks. I missed a lot of classes. I went in just to go through the motions to show myself I can drink and still do this. I was a walking shadow. I wasn't growing or learning...Now I'm 5 days clean. I have slept good and feeling renewed but I have the flu which came on during the last drinking day I had. I eat clean with little processed foods so I think that has allowed me to feel so good after only 5 days. I can only imagine how horrible I would feel without eating clean.....So what now? Except for the first 2 days I have struggled with cravings to drink. I can see the madness now one drink would be too much and 6 would not be enough. I decided to take the rest of the year off of drinking. I allowed myself the *possibility* to return to it if I still wanted to. ..I hate to say this one out loud because it makes me feel like a spineless worm but I think I cannot imagine my life without alcohol right now. I can imagine leaving it for 2 months even though that feels overwhelming. I know I need this break. There is something seriously wrong with this type of behavior. It's not good for me and people next to me...My close ones know that I've been struggling with drinking in the past but I haven't told this latest episode to anyone yet. If I do maybe I realize that I need to quit for good. I think I already know I should. I wish I had the will to quit for good. I hate myself for not having it.. I feel fucking lost.

When I got into recovery I discovered it wasn't about will power.  I couldn't stop on my own and this crushes self-esteem.  Acid and other drugs just hastened my path to treatment and recovery.  Pick up the phone get help it's that simple. 
Hi there badge buddy..sounds like the story of my life. My downfall from coping to overdoing and then not coping was through a divorce and my relation to work/life was pretty similar to your studying. I tried other liberating stuff many years ago but saw that it made me vulnerable to an addiction that I would never be able to recover from. So *never again.*..I ve struggled for ten years now knowing that I cannot drink. Problem is I want to. I still want to. It s an awful breakup from the love of my life and I keep prolonging it. I know how bad it is I know everything still as I m home alone right now at noon a huge part of me only wants to chase that bliss...Luckily being sober gets easier every day and every week. Today I noticed that the body doesn t crave anymore. That leaves me with my grief that bloomed for several reasons today. This is life. Yesterday was better. Tomorrow will be better. Drinking postpones the process of dealing with it...If it freaks you out you don t have to make a choice for the rest of your life. Taking the year off is a brilliant idea. Take a choice for your life today. Take the same choice tomorrow. Take one day at a time and build your strenght. Fake it till you make it. When I quit smoking I said to myself that I could begin again ten years later. That made me ok with it. Now I wouldn t dream of taking up smoking...Your insight that you want to be loved touched me. Sounds to me you found a golden ticket there. And then you found another one seeing the madness in keeping on drinking. This is more enlightenment than many people reach for decades of adult life...Don t hate yourself. Love yourself. Trust me you re worth it.
