So today after a very stressful day of work (at a bar) surrounded by many good friends of mine whom were all drinking in celebration of mother's day I was able to successfully dodge my bad habit. It was a release as I pulled away from work without having drank but I felt anxiety building under the surface... I finally got home and tried to relax without my usual work beer followed by a 4 pack in hand. This is when I started to feel what I assume are withdrawal symptoms. My partner and I watched GoT as is tradition and I was in an atypical way a nervous wreck. I still enjoyed the show but I felt uncomfortably out of sync with myself. I felt like my brain was a heartbeat ahead of my body and it just couldn't seem to catch up. I felt an intense shortness of breath. One after another knot in my stomach along with  bloating and nausea and then set in the panic. ..I've had a lot on my plate to say the least. Tons of deadlines at work we've just begun settling into a new home that has a long list of projects along with it and worst of all I very recently found out my father has lower esophageal cancer. This made for a perfect shitstorm of anxiety when I finally had a few minutes to let it stew after the show. My father has been in treatment for about a week and a half and his mortality along with everyone including my owns has been weighing heavily on my mind. This is when it came to a head...I've been worried about my own health and now suddenly over the past week a thousand little aches and pains are appearing to me only adding to the insurmountable existential anxiety I've already been experiencing. .What if 'I' have cancer? .Is that an ulcer that I'm feeling down there?.Is that my liver failing? .These are some of the thoughts that have flooded my concience rendering me mentally incapable of doing anything other than lie around thinking about drinking or dying. Anything other than the reality I'm living now. These are some of the things I drank to get away from. We're these issues really something my drunken self was able to ignore or disregard? Do I have that bad of a problem? The cycle continued... I tried to shower and relax but it quickly turned into a complete meltdown. Thankfully my partner was with me and saw through my feeble attempts to hide the incoming emotional swell. I try to explain the variables causing the stress I was experiencing in a collected manner but could hardly catch my breath let alone keep a strait face enough to calmly list all the things that were making me feel like I was about to die right then...On my stomach now in bed I start to tear up and my breathing becomes more labored. We sit and talk through everything I was going through and finally I feel a distant echo of light at the end of this very dark tunnel. She asked if I needed some space. I replied yes and she very kindly stepped away. Seconds later I began sobbing for a period that lasted about a half hour. It seemed unbearablly endless but more necessary than anything. This was more than just a general sadness for any one particular reason this was a mighty outpour of emotion a blissful catharsis something I've needed for quite a while...I finally regained a small amount of control over my breathing my heart didn't feel like it was going to stop or explode anymore. I let out a small laugh of relief...  Have a reached the clarity?..I've never experienced withdrawal quite like that and I've never felt more happy to be in bed and sober after the fact...I'm typing this now to help cope and to maybe connect with others who are experiencing the world as I am right now...I've never felt more confident in my descision to not drink and think this may be the time I finally am able to last more than just a few weeks...Best of luck to everyone else struggling out there... I felt some version of your pain today and it does get better. That I can tell already...Here's to not drinking tomorrow either.

I had severe DTs as part of withdrawals. I know how scary it is. I know that pain. You are not alone. You can do it!
Good for you for not drinking! Good for you for going through the emotions and feeling again.  It is not an easy process but it is so worth it! I stopped drinking like my life depended on it and it kinda really does!! IWNDWYT
