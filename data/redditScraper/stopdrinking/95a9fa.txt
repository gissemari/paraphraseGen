So I posted last Monday that I made it through my first 24 hours without having a drink. I'm happy to announce that I've made it through the week and the weekend. The weekend was a big struggle for me since all I used to do was get plastered in my family's little above ground pool on Saturday and sunday with my family. Instead my girlfriend and I went to the aquarium of the Pacific on Saturday and I just played video games and avoided the outside on sunday. Hell my girlfriend and I even went to a beer/cocktail and burger place that we used to go to to have a a drink or two at when we had enough of knotts lol. Had a huge urge to drink but I didn't! Its early Tuesday morning and I feel frigging awesome!

Awesome work on one week! IWNDWYT. Hugs  
Well done.  Can I suggest listening to a podcast byRachel Harte on urges. It's called taking a break from alcohol. I found it brilliant 
Congrats on one week!  It will get easier slowly but surely.  IWNDWYT
Apparently the key is to deal with the urge feel it and let it pass. Distraction or ignoring it doesn't work long term.
