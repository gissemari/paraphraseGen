Hi Sobernauts..I hope everyone is having/had a great Monday. ..Those who have read my [last](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3kwcdc/first_smart_meeting/) [few](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3labr8/am_i_in_the_early_stages_of_relapse/) [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3mg6rq/feeling_a_bit_underwhelmed_with_sobriety_lately/) will know that I've been really really losing interest in AA. At least the AA meetings that I generally go to. I won't rehash but ultimately I'm quite turned off by the higher power idea. ..In the past four months I've tried many of the ways around it (ie. the 'group of drunks' acronym the collective wisdom of the rooms 'dog spelt backwards' a doorknob a tree the tides etc.)  On Thursday someone suggested I check out NA.  At first I was a bit apprehensive sure I've done drugs in the past but after one of my best friends OD'd I said I'd never do them again and haven't or haven't wanted to. I don't consider myself a drug addict. ..The person I was talking to said that a) Alcohol is a drug and b) a lot of people in the AA meetings I go to identify themselves as addicts do I judge them for being in an AA meeting and say "go back to NA!" - Of course not.  She said the crowd is quite a bit younger at this meeting at least there is less emphasis on higher power and more on the stories. ..So I worked up the courage to go. It actually blew me away. The stories were so raw the people were so tight they were gratefully clean. I was really emotional the entire time because here I am so close to throwing away my sobriety and several people in this room were so unbelievably grateful for it or so desperate for it.  There was someone who had used today a few people two days clean and several in their first month. Most of the AA meetings I go to I'm the newest person there and I'm nearly 5 months sober. Hearing newcomers really reminded me how much I need sobriety. ..The other thing that hit me tonight is that addiction is one disease. I got addicted to alcohol because I had access to it but with my personality if I had the time and money and justification in my head to take drugs regularly with this addict brain I could have very easily wound up addicted to drugs. ..So I feel empowered again. I don't know if I'll stick around NA. I don't know if I'll go back to AA. I do know that I will for sure stick around SD. ..Thanks for being here guys.

Great story!!! Have you been to a smart recovery meeting? I havent done AA or NA but I love smart. Might be another adventure for you? Glad things are going well. Let's not drink today!
Good for you!  Whatever works.

I go to both. Works for me just fine  
I'm glad it was a good meeting. Even more important that you are "empowered" and sounding positive again. 
I don't know why the distinction is made between Alcohol and other drugs...Is it because it's legal? When does a substance stop being a drug and become something else entirely? 
Glad to hear it!  Getting that reminder of why you wanted to quit in the first place is priceless.  Happy for you.  :-)
Amazing! I'm so glad you got your mojo back! I never considered going to NA (even though I used to do drugs). I'm going to have a little look and see for myself! . Great update! Thanks /u/McLensky :)
That's inspiring to hear I know I've gained a lot of insight into my addiction through the experiences of others there's so much common ground regardless of poison and circumstance. Meetings and this place often help me with perspective.
I'm glad NA seemed to be a better fit for you! I've been going to AA regularly the past few months have a sponsor and am on step 2 but I really can't get past the God/Higher Power thing too. I've tried all the God cliques but I can't get past it. 
I hate that NA and AA are separate. Alcohol is a drug so are drugs.  I wish they were one big giant group.  I get why they were separated - it was because of the stigma of illegal drugs.  People with alcoholism began to get help before other addicts got help.  It has also been common (I was told this by people who know the history of AA) to have other addicts go to AA in the past for lack of other options.  ..Some AA people did not like that - because of the stigma - so the other addicts started NA eventually.  Isn't that strange though?  AA people in the past had an attitude like: "Oh well sure I may be an alcoholic and all but hey it's not like I'm a *drug addict* or something. Why are those other addicts in *our* rooms?!"  That used to be the attitude way back when for some AAers that prompted people to start NA.  So I've been told. ..Either one is fine. Actually I had the experience of being judged in AA for being an "other addict" - even though I have a problem with alcohol! A person - one person - used to share in AA that people who had problems with other substances too even if they had a problem with alcohol but they also had a problem with other substances that they belonged in NA not AA.  She would make it a point to share for her share and tell everyone that if someone had a problem with other drugs even if alcohol was included that they belonged in NA because AA was "for alcoholics not addicts to other things."  When I confronted her on her bullshit share she was like: "Well that's my share. I have a right to share what I want to share so I share what I want because it's my share."  ..So I totally see why NA was created - there are still people in the rooms with that age-old attitude hellbent on seeing the differences instead of the similarities and eager to make others feel unwelcome so that they can create the AA that they oh so special as they are want to have.  
You sound like you're in a much better headspace today (yesterday? I'm behind things... Again!). I'm so glad! Stay strong. ~k
I'm curious to know what you decided?  I think indecision about which path to take is a sign of a good mind.  With 139 days up your sleeve you seem to be doing well.
