AA requires absolutely no commitment to go to 'open' meetings and the only requirement for 'closed' meetings is that you 'think you have a problem with alcohol.'..A story - ..I actually spent close to a year going to AA meetings drunk *with a bottle in my car* for later.  In my old home town all the (State-owned) liquor stores closed at 9PM.  All the evening AA meetings therefore started at 8PM.  ..I certainly wasn't about to be caught high and dry without a night's supply of booze just in case the good folks at AA didn't 'cure' me of my alcoholism during the meeting so I got a bottle just in case telling myself I wouldn't drink it unless I really really needed it.  ..Once purchased  I couldn't resist taking a few swigs before I got to the meeting just for nerves you know.  After the meeting with an open bottle in my car it seemed prudent to finish it off so it wouldn't go to waste...I didn't this for close to a year confident that since nobody had called me out on my behavior I was getting away with it.  After I *finally* got sober and honest and told everyone what I had been doing they all told me that they knew all along and were just waiting for me to wake up to the insanity of my rationalizing behavior.  Furthermore they knew from experience that to confront me would just alienate me from going to AA so they were more than willing to have me attend on whatever terms I set for myself drunk or not...I had to go through that long ridiculous process before I could finally sober up but once sober I was able to draw upon the information I had gleaned from those interminable drunken meetings I had endured so I'm glad I went despite the seeming futility of the process while I was going through it...So don't feel like you need to clear any hurdles in sobriety before you go to a meeting.  Just go and listen to what gets said with as open a mind as you can muster...You can't do it any more bass-ackwards than I did and it still worked!.   .   ..|Score|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|----|---|----|.|19|SOmuch2learn|*feeling responsible for another person's relapse* by _LB_|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2mx6u0/feeling_responsible_for_another_persons_relapse/cm8ek5i)|.I know you don't want to hear this but cutting off contact is the most loving thing to do for both of you.

I've never been in trouble with the law and it was terrifying. My dad is a police officer so I've seen the horrible effects of driving drunk growing up. My family doesn't drink. I messed up. ..The thing you need to realize is that a lot of people get DUIs. It's not the end of the world. It's a big wake up call and it's going to hurt your wallet and be a pain in the ass for a year. Classes fines alcohol courses etc are going to be annoying because you'll have to figure out rides bike bus walk or whatever. It sucks. But it's not the end of the world. A lot of people have done it. I used to drink a lot like you. But that was a wake up call for me. I would still drink but I would never ever drive or u became very responsible about where I would drink or how I would get home after. If I had any alcohol in my system I'd sleep in the back of my car. I never wanted to risk going through that again. It's a lesson learned and one that sucks in so many ways. If you can afford a lawyer get one - saves you time headaches and stress. Be prepared to find alternate ways of transportation. I too was worried about jail time but it sounds like you didn't injure anyone and you were polite to the police - don't stress. I did and it almost ruined me...Now three years later I've slowly changed my habits I've learned about blood alcohol levels (I don't know why everyone isn't required to learn about this when we turn 21) I've become more aware and responsible about drinking. Now I don't even drink hardly ever. Maybe 1 drink every month. I feel great and I always think back to the awful year of my life. I learned from it and I have helped my friends and family who drink be more aware of their choices. I'm always the overly cautious one who decided to have one too many one night with a broken taillight...I hope this helps. Let this experience make you stronger. Learn from it. Be honest with yourself and allow this to help you in the future. It did for me and I am so happy today. I don't know how reckless I would be today if I didn't experience that DUI. ..All the best to you.

Please note however that I am not picking on you in any way...If my daughter came to me and told me this story my advice to her would be run not walk run from this relationship.  I would tell her that in my own personal experiences alcoholics who have excuses why they can't go to treatment programs or support groups are frequently not committed to their sobriety.  They will often talk the talk especially when they are in trouble with their SOs but when it comes time to walk the walk they won't follow through.  They are too distracted with finding reasons why trusted means of recovery just won't work for them...I would tell her that continuing to stay in a relationship like this will just inevitably lead her down the path to co-dependency lies fear and trust issues.  I would tell my daughter that she shouldn't subject herself to a life like this.  ..I know for me and most alcoholics I have met it takes more than simply coming to this sub and "hoping" a "monster" inside of me is defeated.

MY. GOD.   You are not going to believe this.  First I just woke up and my phone was (I swear to God) for some reason playing Pigs and I don't know why.  One of first lyrics I comprehended was that [part about the mouse.](http://www.pink-floyd-lyrics.com/html/pigs-animals-lyrics.html)  You already think I'm lying.  I'm not.  I still don't know why my phone was playing music.  Don't fall asleep holding your phone.

You will thank me later...LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT MY SOAP. IRC people can move along I've already told this story twice everyone thinks I'm insane...For the last two weeks I've been taking a "nap" in the evenings and then waking up at 1 or 2 am ready to start my day.  It's not ideal. ..Last week I was up for a few hours then 6 am rolled around so I hopped in the shower.  Washed my hair noticed my face was especially oily so I went to grab the soap.  There was no soap...Let me repeat: THERE WAS NO SOAP...... ..DO YOU NOT SEE THE PROBLEM HERE?..... ..OK a couple of things you might need to know.  1) I live alone.  2) There is never a time when there is zero soap in my shower.  See what happens is that one bar of soap starts running low so I grab a another bar.  Then for a little while I have two bars of soap in there one full bar and one almost-gone bar.  The almost-gone bar soon graduates to completely-gone status and I then begin a relationship with the new bar.  Point is for a time those two bars of soap sit next to each other.  I like to think that while I'm away the experienced bar does knowledge transfer & brings the n00b bar up to speed on what will be expected of it...Everyone with me?  I'm showering at an unusual time. I feel especially oily so I depart from my usual showering routine and go to grab the soap.  There is no soap.  There should NEVER be a time when there is no soap.  But there is no soap.  Had I not felt especially oily I wouldn't have departed from that routine. I would have just done my thing largely on auto-pilot.  ..Do you see the problem now?..There should always be soap in there. ALWAYS...I think it's unlikely that someone broke in to my house to steal only my half used bar of soap. They'd have had to pass up all sorts of other goodies which include a dozen bars of pristine never-before-opened soap.  Sure OK maybe they didn't think to check the closet.  And that soap is on a pretty high shelf and maybe the criminal was super short. But the shelves in there are a wire mesh dealie (that is not solid) so the little person should have been able to look up and see that soap from below.  It's high up but it's not like I go out of my way to hide it.  That person could have EASILY dragged a footstool into the room to reach that shelf or climbed up on the lower shelves.  If you're a professional soap thief I'd think that you'd at least know to first look for the motherlode.  ..And the person would have had to pass up all kinds of other goodies along the way.  Computers other electronics my sweet cereal collection.  Everything else is in its place. The only thing missing is the soap...I think the thief theory is out. It doesn't make any sense.  ..It could have been the CIA or NSA but I don't see why they would be after my soap.  I checked the places where someone like that would likely hide a listening device; I can't find anything like that.  Someone suggested aliens. I can't rule that out but I think it's unlikely.  I have no doubt that life exists on other planets but I've yet to see any credible evidence that they're visiting Earth and I'm pretty sure the laws of physics would prevent any alien civilization from traveling too far outside their own solar system no matter how advanced.  Yeah yeah time dilation I know. But putting aside the energy problems for the moment I have to think that aliens have families too. It's not like they're gonna just kiss everyone they know goodbye and hop a skip to a far flung planet never to see their families again just to abduct my soap. What kind of life is that?..The most likely explanation is that I at some point ran out of soap didn't think to replace it and I never noticed.  ..HOW IN THE HELL LONG HAVE I BEEN SHOWERING WITHOUT SOAP?..*And when you lose control*  .*You'll reap the harvest you have sown.*  .*And as the fear grows*  .*The bad blood slows and turns to stone.*   .*And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around*  ...*So have a good drown*   .*as you go down*   .*all alone*  .*Dragged down by the ~~stone~~ soap*.   .   ..|Score|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|----|---|----|.|11|CasperTFG_808|*I'm 76 days in and on the road to buttering myself but I need help* by 5user5|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2n2wan/im_76_days_in_and_on_the_road_to_buttering_myself/cm9utte)|.These puns butter end soon.
