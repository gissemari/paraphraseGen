So I'm not really sure how to do this. And I am pretty embarrassed but I'm pretty sure I need to stop drinking. The last few years have been pretty rough. It's been riddled with deaths unemployment injuries and depression. Though for the most part I am able to pull myself up by my bootstraps and keep on going. The one thing that is holding me back is my drinking.. And it's just getting worse. Now my drinking problem isn't to the point that I have to drink as soon as a wake up. I can go to work and maintain myself during the day.. But as soon as the evening comes I am drinking half a bottle of whiskey or a sixer. Because of this I have been struggling with my weight stomach issues and feeling guilty that I am failing my wife and son. I have also became extremely lazy and a terrible procrastinator. Every time I think about this all I want to do is drown my sorrows. I know it's wrong but every time I drink I feel as if everything is going to be better tomorrow.. But of course not. I know the only way to get better is to say no to alcohol. But I'm not sure I can.

When I first quit I could only commit to not drinking for an hour at a time. Eventually I could commit to not drinking for an entire day.../u/coolcrosby has an excellent baby steps post. I'm on mobile and unsure how to link to it. I'm sure CC will be along shortly to help us out.
You're not alone in how you feel. You can do it :)
Thank you for that. Sounds so simple but it's definitely a challenge.
