I want to get sober...I feel like AA Is not an option because I am still holding onto a thread that I can become a normal drinker and do it myself...I have been in NA 10 years ago but never relapsed to drugs...Depression has been getting stronger and stronger over the years. Alcohol helps but makes it worse. Starting to see why people neck themselves...Recently on an SSRI and booked in to see a psychologist in 20 days...Thanks for sharing and being here everyone. Hope this story of hell helps you with your sobriety.

Good on you for wanting to be sober. This is a fantastic first step CAT...Being that you're on SSRI's were you able to speak with your doctor about getting sober?..Great job on making the appointment with your psychologist! That helped me immensely. I hope it does the same for you :)...Looking forward to hearing more!.
All it takes is you. And trust me while the black dog still barks at the door occasionally it's so much easier to deal with sober and he runs away  so so much quicker. ..Shoulders back stand proud and defiant and enjoy the good times to come. ..Good luck and keep on truckin 
The ssri works much better when I abstain but being on meds only was not enough of a reason for me to not drink.   ..AA will be there when you are ready.  Best to you.
