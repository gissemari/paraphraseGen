So last night I realized that I'm truly out of control. I told myself I wasn't  but I was wrong.  ..My issue is that I work part time in the recovery setting with teens.  I'm not sure how I'd go about attending a support group as someone with an alcohol problem and see a patient. My husband told me that I'd see them  and that it's not as if I'm better than them.  I'm mostly just struggling with the boundaries and dial relationship aspect.  ..Anyone have any ideas or resources for me. My Googleing is giving me info about attending for observation.

My only advice is to put your sobriety and recovery first. Everything else will work itself out.
I find most people who specialize in recovery work are also in recovery. I started going to AA meetings with a counselor who is also in AA. If anything it may be advantage to be able to show yourself walking the walk...On the other hand if you think your role in the care of these recovering teens requires firmer boundaries than that it might be a good idea to talk to your employer or licencing board or whoever is responsible for overseeing ethics. I agree with /u/cyclefreaksix that it is best for sobriety and recovery to come before obligations to others if that is necessary...All I would add is that it might be possible to find a support group that by its nature won't include your teen patients like a professionals' group or a group where the demographic naturally skews older.
