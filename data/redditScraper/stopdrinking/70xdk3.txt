I recently ended a longterm relationship with someone I loved very much. I have been struggling  and I was extremely depressed. So I turned to alcohol as I always did. Of course nothing got better in fact even worse. I was contemplating suicide and as my last resort I decided to make some major changes in my life. I told myself if nothing got better I would end it. . It's been 3 months. I've had my share of hiccups but I've done my best to keep myself busy by working out and staying healthy. Physically I feel fantastic! I have gotten into shape and I owe it all to being sober. I feel healthier happier energetic and much more motivated. I wanted to share for anyone considering or may be going through the same. .I still struggle a lot but I feel like I am able to push myself and keep going.  Good luck everyone..http://imgur.com/abGHjxV

Very nice work!
Wow! You look HOT (glad my boyfriends not on here  ) I'm so glad things got better for you! Male suicide is not talked about enough often until it's very sadly too late so anything we can do to help raise awareness is fab in my opinion! I will not drink with you today! Congratulations  
I've definitely been that depressed before and booze never helped. Your story is quite motivating. And of course you look HOT! Amazing job!
Iam in the same boat as you was  trying to set same goals as you joined gym and going to focus on my self rather than the booze .well done to you
Daaaayyyyummmm dude good for you!!!
