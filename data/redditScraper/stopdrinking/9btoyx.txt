Last Friday I woke up around 11 as usual feeling like crap and groggy from the usual 18-24 ounces of vodka.  I had been depressed for weeks and knew I wanted change.  3 days before  I had found SD.  I thought MAYBE I could get through 2 nights but never imagined a week.  But each day I felt better and slept better so here it is.  A week!  .I have a long way to go and Im sure there will be bumps in the road of course but I just want to say this.  Anyone lurking and thinking of quitting all you have to do is get started.  There is amazing people here with the same struggles as you and I.  The support is amazing.  Im not gonna lie those first couple days SUCK!  But each day I can see change and improvements in how I feel mentally and physically.  My sleep is already back to the way it was when I was a teenager (not 12 hours but a solid 8-9).  ..Everyone here just kept telling me to take it one day one hour one second at a time or just one foot in front of the other and just dont drink for that moment and that moment only.  Just for today Im not drinking.  Heres to another sober weekend!  ..Ryan

Yah! It's crazy how little faith we have in ourselves when the alcohol is in control and really cool to notice yourself getting that faith back. 
Making the choice to start was so hard and has always been hard for me but once I have a few days behind me it gets easier.  My problem has always been allowing myself a future date like "I'll not drink until x event and after that I'll will absolutely go back to not drinking daily."  Except that never happens.  I do good for a few weeks even as long as 2.5 months but once said event occurs I would get smashed and fall right back into daily drinking for months or longer.  This is the first time I am experimenting with no end date for my self imposed booze ban.   And yeah even at day six my sleep is so much better as well as my mood.  Waking up feeling good and having ZERO anxiety is a blessing I want to continue to experience.   IWNDWYT!!
