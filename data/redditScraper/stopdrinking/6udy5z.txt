Wouldn't let me just talk to him. Is this normal? I'm struggling cause I need support and don't have a good feeling. Maybe just nerve and withdrawls.

Never heard of that. What sort of counselor was it?
Is it mandated counseling? If not I'd get a different counselor. Unless you have intent to harm yourself or others they are bound by confidentiality and a good one will just listen if that's what you need. Good luck asking for support is a huge step! 
Years ago I sought help from a local alcohol counselor out of my own free will and he tried to make me have a urine test. Apparently he dealt with DUI and other court ordered clients. I wasn't one of those and just wanted to get sober. I bolted because it felt shameful to have to submit to pee tests and Lord only knows I already felt enough shame as an alcoholic.
