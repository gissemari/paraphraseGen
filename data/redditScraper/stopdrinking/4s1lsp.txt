I've heard this a lot over the years. But never from an actual therapist. I think now that I really internalized this idea and it has tripped my up again and again. For example I could hit the 1-2 week mark and say "welp time for my relapse guyz!"..I'm not doing that this time. I don't want relapse to be part of my  recovery any longer. And I'm making that happen one day at a time with a morning pledge before I even have my coffee then lots of reflection and serious introspection for at least part of the day. ..Playing the tape forward helps too. I have so many damn tapes to choose from. Shall I play "Spending the night hunched over the toilet" or "Angry messages to acquaintances." Oh how about "Losing 6 hours to a blackout" now there's a classic! But my all time favorite is probably "Where am I?"

This tickled me a bit...oh how I identify ;) Very early days for me but couldn't agree with this sentiment more! Well done on 21 days and I'll not drink with you today :) 
For some it is but it certainly doesn't have to be! Some people get sober right away some people need to gain traction. I had to gain some traction. I learn things about myself after a relapse but looking back I'm making progress. And that's what it's about. Good luck to you today friend!
But it doesn't have to be. I picked up my first chip 6-1-15 and am still sober to this day. However I by no means have got this thing mastered. I have today to do the things today that I need to stay sober today. Well wishes friend!
ok your tapes made me laugh thanks...To me "relapse is a part of recovery".doesn't mean sure go out and relapse just don't beat yourself up if you do. You can remain in recovery after a slip
Relapse has **not** been a part of my recovery and I'm not planning on it. 
I consider relapses to be avoidable I intend to avoid doing so. They sound painful and hard work I'd rather keep it easy and stay sober.
I definitely don't buy into relapse being any kind of necessary part of recovery. I think you make a good point in saying that sayings like that allow people to actively PLAN for relapses. Certainly they happen to many people but a lot of times they aren't just relapses - those people frequently don't make it back to sobriety at all. ..Your tape selection is some pretty damn good motivation for not drinking today! May I add "Lying to everyone you know about how you broke your rib"? I wasn't doing extreme sports - I fell on the toilet!
Relapse is in no way a part of recovery. Recovery is so you don't relapse.
I'm 54 years old and not once but twice I have had 2+ years in.  I Relapsed --for years in between mind you-- when **I stopped doing the things that kept me in recovery**; when I chose to forget I was an alcoholic and risked fully knowing what even that *one drink* would lead to...I wrote this is another post awhile back which seems appropriate:  ..&gt;  MY key to sobriety is knowing down to the atoms of every cell in my body that I do Not have another "Day 1" in me.   .If I would drink again I will also write my obit: "She died a drunk".
not for me...they just sound like a bunch of misery to me.
I think there kinds of or degrees of relapse too. It doesn't always have to involve drinking. Like for me the main things that drove me to drink were work stress and boredom. So if I find myself chronically procrastinating / stalling for a few days I know I'm on the road to a difficult time mentally. I'm leaving too little time to do work increasing the odds of being stressed and then not being great to my fam / friends. Do I drink? Not so far. But I'm consciously putting myself in a position where drinking might be more appealing. 
Chiming in to say that relapse is not part of my recovery.  I know where you're coming from in thinking that though.  In fact I knew when I started that if I allowed it to happen once then it would open the door to happening over and over. So I made the decision to not even consider it an option.
Without a recovery group I relapsed every morning. Every night was always my last night using or drinking. Now that I've found a system that works to keep me sober I plan to stay far away from relapses. 
You don't need to relapse. However if you do you are not doomed.  You can recover from that relapse and move on with your sober life.  That is what that concept means. Not that one is fated or required to relapse in order to recover. ..If you were obese and on a diet and you break your diet you can go back on it. But if you break your diet every day it will really slow you down and you may never get around to a healthy weight. 
lol.."Where am I?" made me laugh!
Ha my therapist said that to me yesterday (the first time I'd heard it). 
It's like saying "car crashes are part of the panel-beating process"
A psych told me once that it often takes 5-6 times of intensive trying to finally stop (for alcoholics as serious as I was - I'm definitely not just a hard drinker - which is another angle entirely).  ..I ended up right around that - a little more - at the current point.  I'm also where I don't know if I have another recovery in me should I go out again.  ..I learned a lot each time but had to keep testing for some dumb reason that kept changing.  ..Doesn't have to be and it's not a bad thing if relapse is part of recovery - especially if you get back on the horse and ride sober again.  
Relapse doesn't have to be part of recovery however it doesn't mean you failed at recovery and it is by no means a reason to surrender to the disease...There aren't any vacations from this disease and you don't get to take relapse breaks but should you relapse don't feel like a failure. Get the help you need and continue with your recovery..."Relapse is part of recovery" isn't a get out of alcoholism free card but it does happen. There is no shame in it and as long as you're working towards recovery you aren't a failure even if there is a hiccup or two. Keep working at it man maybe your last relapse will actually be your last.
I just passed a year the other day.  Relapse is my fucking enemy.  Not even a word in my dictionary.  Screw that shit.

Relapse has not been part of my journey and I sure don't want it to be...However if I "had" a relapse then it would be part of my recovery at that point!  ..Good Luck !!
Not for me. That has never been an option and I pray it never is.
An old timer once told me that "relapse" is too nice a word for it. We use words like relapse to shield us from the truth. Sounds nice and cosy doesn't it - "relapse" - sounds like a nice safe place to go to like "rehab" and "recovery". But the reality was far from nice and cosy. I'm an alcoholic when I drink I get drunk - violently anti-socially drunk. It was far from a nice safe place to go to. The reality is that I took the first drink and I wound up drunk and then I did a whole load of other nasty things as a consequence of me getting drunk. And the reason why I got drunk is because I took that first drink despite knowing that for me one drink is too many and a thousand is not enough. ..Today marks 2300 days sober for me - it is possible to do it I am living truth of that. It helps me remind myself that if I drink I'll get drunk I don't hide behind wishy washy words like relapse and recovery. I live a sober life today...
I think that relapse is part of *addiction*. If I wasn't an addict there wouldn't be this struggle. For me experiencing multiple relapses after a long period of sobriety reinforced the undeniable truth: I am an alcoholic.
I know! I relapsed just over a week ago on Canada Day. Just now I was driving up a hill which is a popular viewing spot for the fireworks. I thought to myself "I'm looking forward to seeing them" then remembered that they were last week and I was blacked out alone at home at the time :(..D'oh! Stupid relapse!
I used to have a thought process that nuanced lapse vs. relapse. I envisioned myself "lapsing" only to get back on the wagon immediately again and not fall into a long term "relapse". So is a lapse just one night or one weekend or a 3 day weekend? At what point does a lapse become a relapse? For me this is the same sort of addiction negotiation that happens when trying to moderate. Easier to just say no stay sober not negotiate and not have to find out if I have another Day 1 in me. One day at a time.
Something I heard that kept me going for a long time is "You're either busy with your recovery or your relapse" we are confronted with choices every day hour minute... Like many said its not a part of recovery but if it happens get up and keep on walking. Congrats to all those who reached a new milestone. 
Your "Where am I" made me laugh!  ..But it stops being funny of course. There's "Why am I dead?"..I vividly remember my counselor at rehab emphatically telling me "This shit will KILL you! It will KILL YOU!"  ..Too many of us have dead friends.  ..I hope you join in face-to-face with others like us and feel the love and support! Reach out!
These ideas are my own personal opinions based on my own experience.  Recovery is relapse prevention and a relapse is a recovery fail.  There is a distinction between relapse and a failure to stop drinking.  A dry spell even an extended one is not necessarily sobriety.  Sobriety involves a personality change.  A relapse requires that some degree of sobriety has been attained.  Just my humble opinions.  Many people I know got sober and remain so.  Many others experience a relapse after some sober time.  The biggest group never gets far enough along in recovery to actually stop drinking.
I always do a risk/reward analysis. It always tells me not to drink.
Haha i love your collection of tapes! I have the same set in collectors edition. Not drinking with ya tonight! 
My relapse after 12 years sober was not part of my recovery although it was part of my life. There were deep issues at play in my drinking. I ignored them but they did not ignore me. My point is that once we get rid of the habit we need to get rid of the true causes of our dependency. This time around I make sure not to leave stones unturned.
Yep I've been relapsing my way to nowhere over and over again.  ..This time is the hardest - sometimes one hour at a time of resisting the urge - just one drink to relax.  I woke up grumpy this morning for no reason!  Maybe that's just part of being normal I don't know.  But I do know I will not drink today.  Congratulations on 21 days!

I relapsed once and told myself it was for the fact of finally understanding that I can no longer drink anymore at all. Now my thoughts are I can not relapse for the fact of so not wanting to start at day 1 again. So far so good.
Relapsed a couple days ago after being sober for 4 months 
Relapse doesn't mean you have failed. But of all the things that are most important to me in my recovering the #1 thing is "don't relapse". Whatever you can do to prevent or avoid a relapse I think is worth doing...Relapse should not be viewed as a parachute or life preserver in my opinion. Relapse should scare the crap out of you. There is no guarantee you will make it back from a relapse.
There is the school of thought that if you're not in "recovery" mode you're heading for a relapse or already in relapse already. Many of these folks are those that say that relapse starts well before the first drink. Others may contend that it's a false dichotomy and it's not one or the other. I'll play it safe and just try to keep my recovery as strong as it can be..edit: that being said I did reset my badge 4 times before the last time. Many of us don't get it the first time
My relapse after 10 years of sobriety was not part of my recovery; it happened when I became complacent when I thought I could "moderate" and when I no longer kept my focus.  Relapse was a choice for me but it was definitely not a choice related to my recovery.  I firmly believe that these are separate and distinct choices and that relapse while it was a part of my journey and many others' is not required for recovery.  Perhaps the contrast of relapse vs. sobriety can be a "helpful" lens through which to look in terms of commitment to sobriety but I think I don't want that view this time around.
