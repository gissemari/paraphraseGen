Seeing that 161 on my badge really drives home how easy it is for me to fall away from sobriety. I had made it 45 days and decided to just go back into drinking. I can't think back to the exact reason and there's not anything I can think of to justify this other relapse...Thank you all for reading.

Welcome back.
I'm glad you're back; many don't make it. I needed lots of support to stay sober. Therapy treatment and AA gave me the tools I needed. 
Right there with you. Day 1 again. It really is too easy to fall back into old patterns. 
Glad you came back! Just imagine how great it'll feel passing 45 days sober :)
