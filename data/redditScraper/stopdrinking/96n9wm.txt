Spent yesterday vomiting up bile and didn't make it off the couch to do anything productive.  I was in DDIOP last October strung together a couple 40ish day dry stints but have had a relapsing summer.  This is my attempt to get things back on track.  Hope y'all are well...p.s. Leslie Jamison's The Recovering: Intoxication and its Aftermath was my favorite book this year!

Thanks for saying hello there ghost.  I only have a few weeks without drinking myself but coming here and reading posts like yours helps me a lot.  I had a lot of days like you had yesterday.  Vomiting up bile and feeling god awful.  The physical and emotional pain are horrible to me anyway.  Most folks really wouldn't get that or know what I'm talking about.  I think you know what it's like.  I thought about getting a drink today but I read this sub and I think I can make it through tonight.  Thanks for the book tip and let's go for one more day without drinking my friend.
Lousy day you had yesterday. How is today going ? 
Raising my coffee for a toast to better days for you!
I can't think of anything more productive that staying sober!
