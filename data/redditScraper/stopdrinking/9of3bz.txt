My dad has been sober since I was 6 months old and goes to at least one meeting (sometimes more) per week. He knows a ton of the folks. I know it's "anonymous" but I'm struggling telling anyone let alone people who will know me.   ...I'm so glad I have found you all here today but I also know that I really need some in-person support.   ...Not quite feeling ready to reach out to my father about this and want to start this without him and do this on my own for a while. I feel like this would be so much easier if I could blend in with strangers when I started  ...How did you all decide to start going to meetings?

Seriously- I think if folks know your Dad they won't be surprised to see you. My mom and all her family are alcoholic her father drank himself to death and died at 36. It runs in families...Go. You won't regret it.
Is there another meeting you can go to besides the one your Dad attends?  ..Alcoholics Anonymous is a very non-judgmental place.  Everyone there is there because they have a drinking problem. Many have hit rock bottom and then some.  ..Alcoholism runs in families.  This fact is well-known.  No one will be surprised that your Dad is an alcoholic and so are you...Go into AA with low expectations.  You'll find that the meetings are all over the place.  Some are pretty much useless and others are wonderful.  I've rarely attended a meeting that I couldn't take something from.  Go in looking for similarities rather than differences.  ..Good luck friend...I will not drink with you today. 
I was incredibly anxious before my first meeting. Within minutes it all melted away. Folks in AA are really understanding and supportive. It's nice to be surrounded by people that know the struggle. I left feeling great. Most cities and towns have multiple meetings every day so you don't have to go to the one your dad frequents. Saying "I'm Papi Queso and I'm an alcoholic" out loud for the first time was incredibly liberating. Give it shot!
I went to AA regularly for about 3 years and still go just not very often now. I can tell you I was VERY uncomfortable before the first meeting. For me it did not go away right away but after a couple of meetings it did. ..I still get uncomfortable before most meetings but as soon as I commit and step in the rooms the discomfort is removed. I remember that they are just drunks like me and are there to share and give support. I ALWAYS feel better leaving the meeting and am glad I went. ..No matter how uncomfortable you may feel facing it and staying sober is worth the work. I hope you go to a meeting and get the support you need!
I wrote about my experience with AA here.  Hope this helps. ..[https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/9ofma5/my\_experience\_with\_aasix\_weeks\_in\_hopefully\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/9ofma5/my_experience_with_aasix_weeks_in_hopefully_this/)
Im a 36/f i went to a meeting for the first time last year. I was absolutely terrified. It was an eye opening and a positive experience. Just being able to listen to others and their experiences and being able to share my own was pretty amazing. Its an emotional kick in the pants.
I'm confident you'll feel differently AA is a room full of people strong enough to face their issues they want change they want to live better lives. Alcoholism or not there's not many I know willing to face things they struggle with embrace your imperfectness and know that it can always be worse 
Scared shitless when I went to my first meeting last week. I was choking back tears the whole time. I was going through withdrawals. I was quiet and shaking. ..When people looked at me I felt like they saw my first day playing across my face I could see it in their reactions. And without saying anything to me they radiated compassion and acceptance. I hope this is how it goes for you today.
