Just wondered if anyone else used it as I find it really useful and the latest update includes a relapse aid feature. Well have a look..IWNDWYT

I love EasyQuit! I've been using it during this latest journey into sobriety and have used it before in the past too. Totally recommend it to anyone I know of who wants to quit or cut back on drinking
Yep for the pro edition.  Helps loads in the beginning.
Thanks for this recommendation. I had a sober app awhile back and looks like it's not available anymore or I just can't remember what it was called...I'm just gonna blame that on alcohol brain too. LOL!
Mine's called  I Am Sober  .I love it. Let's you set reminders for a daily pledge and a daily review. Also has other anon users that post their story every milestone they reach. No commenting no messaging - strictly anonymous. Try it out!
