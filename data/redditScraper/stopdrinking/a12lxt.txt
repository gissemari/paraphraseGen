It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-----------------------------------------..**Struggle:** I almost never cry. (I once had a boyfriend a Marine who would complain  It takes an act of congress to get you to shed a tear! ) But the other day I was driving down the street and saw a large possum that clearly had just been hit by a car. He was wounded and looked poorly and forlorn. I called Animal Care &amp; Control and did everything I could to help and then afterwards when I was alone I burst into tears. ..My reaction surprised me and made me realize just how much the stress of the past few years (worry over my liver failure my brain tumor etc.) I have kept bottled up in an effort to simply *get through it.* I need to find healthy ways to release tension instead of just  doing fine  and then suddenly becoming distraught at the sight of an injured animal...**Triumph:** I hate to be a Pollyanna but even after three and a half years every night that I hit the pillow sober is a triumph. In all honesty I am very grateful to still be alive...**General:** Two alcoholics go to a movie theater to see The Lost Weekend (a harrowing film about an alcoholic's downward spiral). After the film one alcoholic says  Oh my God. I am never drinking again.  The other says  Oh my God. I am never seeing a movie again. ..I have never seen The Lost Weekend but after I heard this joke I thought I was totally the kind of drinker that would have reacted by never watching a movie again..
----------immediate responses--------

I'm quitting smoking so I hate the world :)
Struggle/Triumph:    .My pattern of drinking was "functional" -- I drank almost but not every night no one knew I had a problem except the people I told (and even they had to be convinced because I hid it pretty well).  I could generally pull it back just enough to survive (most of) life's next-day tasks albeit at a diminished capacity while waiting for a "free" night where I could really get blasted again and release all that tension build-up. I'm still very early into sobriety and have had a good streak of a few weeks but I relapsed and drank again a little more than a week ago -- of course on a "free" night where there were no consequences to being hungover the next day. I counted it as a fuck up and got right back on the wagon. But the actual struggle and triumph came tonight: After a week plus sober after a very long busy stressful and successful day and having already had one fuck up without my world falling apart my mind tells me I can have two glasses of wine. Just tonight just once.   .My mind says I can buy 2 individual-serving bottles across the street stop after exactly 2 because I have a big day tomorrow okay maybe I'll accidentally stop at 3 but even that won't wreck me. I know I could have done that and could have forced myself to stop at 2 3 tops go to bed feeling mildly deprived but wake up more or less fine. But then the cycle starts all over again -- when would be the next "free night" when I could release that tension let go and have the other drinks I stopped myself from having tonight?    .Well fuck that. I delayed and it was really difficult really truly white knuckles. I made a green smoothie. I put the laundry away. I let my mind drift back to the thoughts I was having earlier in the day about how happy I am that my mind is getting clearer. I played the tape forward to how if I drank 2 of those little bottles I would almost certainly crave a 3rd after that how after 3 I would be just on the borderline of the amount of alcohol that would cause me to wake up in the middle of the night and end up facing tomorrow sleepless and stupid. I imagined what it feels like to be drunk and to be hungover what wine feels like in my stomach the sick feeling and viscerally felt it. And as the clutches of the craving started to release a little bit I was able to ask myself:    .*What's wrong with right now?*    .What is so wrong with right now that you would like to do a serious hard drug that if you continue to use it could completely fuck up your life?    .I looked around and despite some actual stresses and difficulties going on in life nothing was really that wrong.    .I slowly was able to remind myself that I didn't "stop drinking (except for sometimes)" -- I don't drink alcohol. Anymore. Because of the back-and-forth "functional" drinking pattern I had this might be the first time I ever really overcame this kind of craving.    .Within about 20 minutes I felt the craving totally subside and the thought of drinking actually made me feel nauseous. I realized all the things I *actually* want to be doing after my long difficult day: such as genuinely relaxing (ever notice that drinking does not actually fucking relax you? to me it feels like a symbol of relaxation but not actually relaxing). Letting the day go. Letting my mind drift. Letting go of work tasks. Maybe stretching or reading or taking a bath or thinking about whatever.   .When I drank I was in a habit of working really hard until the late evening when I'd drink "to relax" but actually I'd just keep on working but add in alcohol after a certain hour. Letting myself neither drink nor work but just fucking exist is really hard. When is the work done for the day? When have I done enough? When am I sufficient? Tonight I feel like I took a step towards finding answers to those questions that I might be able to live with.    .    .Sorry for the long post but it helped me to write it. I looked in the mirror after I overcame that craving and loud and clear the thought that came to my mind was "I am so fucking proud of you right now."  .I'm so grateful for this sub and to all of you. IWNDWYT.  ...tl;dr   Tonight I battled an alcohol craving and won.
Went to AA. Started to have a mini panic attack thinking about how these are all real people. Maybe i should socialize more. Not drinking today. 
Is is anyone else's badge not changing? Mine hasn't gone up in a few days.
Wednesday is a particularly important one for me to get past. Every Wednesday for the last couple of years I've gone to a social event at a particular cheap bar with my friend. Had so much fun there and although the drinking itself is very bad at least it was 'healthier' than drinking at home alone... but today I must resist and not go. Instead I need to go home and write a job application.
Since I've saved a quite significant amount of money just bought myself a treat for as a reward to my upcoming two weeks anniversary s Drinking is not cheap as it used to be.
Struggle: I realise I need to find some new friends but this is the thing that I find the hardest when sober. I used to be great at meeting all kinds of people while half cut but while sober - it just takes longer...I miss the way drinking propels friendship forward so quickly. But I guess I don't miss some of the bad stuff that came with that and for me it did...Triumph: I moved house. There are actually quite a few problems with my new place but I am so calm about it all. My SO is stressed but I'm cool as a cucumber...Pretty great to be the level headed one...General: I finally get paid after for months unemployment on Friday and I can't wait! Professional person coming through. 
**Struggle:** There are good days and bad days. Today is a day for lying under a blanket doing as little as possible but the stress in the body doesn t agree quite yet. ..**Triumph:** I just finished a second course in magazine design and I had a blast! I m so happy I dared to start following my dreams when everything was dark. It has given me hope for the future even on low days like this...**General:** Winter is here. A week now with -7C/20F but no snow yet. My five year old was thrilled at discovering the shimmering stardust in the frost when we left the house this morning. Moments like these are so so precious. I m so happy I was present to experience it...u/sfgirlmary sending you thoughts and prayers.
I really don't like my job. It's not challenging and petty gossip is all around me. Feeling slumped has been my reason to drink..Imma bout to flip it. The downtime I have today I'll use for reading/walks/meal planning. I won't turn into the women I work with and IWNDWYT!
Hi All. Long time lurker here  ..Struggle: I have a perpetual fear that people are going to go from being my friend to hating and abandoning me. This makes me keep people at a distance in most capacities. Working on it with my therapist as I'm certain it stems from my childhood. Also makes me realIze the one  person  I've always trusted to never leave me is booze. Go figure...Triumph: I had the best afternoon ever with my 2-year-old son. We went to the mall after work ran some productive errands bought and played with some cars and won a bunch of stuff in a new arcade. He was so happy. Being a sober dad is one of my most compelling reasons for kicking booze in the nuts...General: I'm doing okay. Nervous about the holidays because I'll be trapped in a condo with heavy drinking in laws for almost a whole week in a city I'm unfamiliar with. Assembling my toolbox however.
Struggle: my new position has me unable to make meetings (for now)  it also is doing this stall thing because other's that have signed on keep dropping out. ..Triumph: normally the above would've been super discouraging and I'd be freaking out. I'm much less worried about it. I just do what I'm supposed to and worry about myself. It's not my job to recruit or make magic happen. God will handle it. ..General/triumph 2: wedding planning has been good stressful. Deposits on venue photographer and band. Also paid for my dress!!
*struggle* staying present right now supporting my child in her grief making all the adulting decisions about our dear furbaby and knowing that her whole body is failing [the vet didn't tell us until we got there to pick her up that she lost her vision today as her eyes are now failing too]. making the call to organise a local vet to come and help her on her way across the rainbow bridge tomorrow morning when her dose of pain meds will have worn off. Making this last evening of me kiddo and furbaby a special loving and peaceful one for them both. feeling like somehow as "the grownup" I shouldn't be as upset as I am. wine would not change a thing and it wouldn't make it go away either. But.... we all know that whispered "but..."..*triumph* despite the but I am not drinking. And I started the application process for university next year last night - even though it's hard to think past one hour at a time right now...*general* I realise I know two kinds of people [friends and clients} those for whom a pet is "just a pet" and those who get it that some critters are entirely beloved family members. *in my life there are no 'just pets'*.  
Your message about the movie kind of reminds me of how I felt when I would watch hospital commercials on TV. I would hate to think about hospitals because my sub conscious knew I was treating myself like crap. Therefore I just avoided the feelings with the commercials. Now I am facing reality and I probably can watch those commercials without feeling scared...&amp;#x200B;..Struggle: Work is in a weird spot - can't go into specifics but I am in unknown territory with my visa status and I am getting paid to not work. Doesn't sound that bad but it doesn't feel that good either. Also work keeps me occupied...&amp;#x200B;..Triumph: I have been handling my recent life problems SO MUCH better in sobriety. Knocked out some extra curricular work and have been pushing through negative emotions relating to different scenarios. ..&amp;#x200B;..General: Enjoy life...&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;
Struggle: Ever since I stopped drinking it seems like my brain needs to be obsessed with *something*. Maybe it's a part of my addiction but it can literally be anything. I get an idea in my head and before I know it all of my thoughts and energy go to that idea. Now that my gut issues have been fixed hopefully I've become obsessed with working out and eating just right. These aren't exactly bad things but anything in excess can have bad effects. I really need to work on finding a balance not everything needs to be all or nothing in my life. ..Triumph: Sometimes good news can be just as much a drinking trigger for me as bad. This week we got extremely good news my grandson's MRI shows no abnormalities in his brain and his seizures seem to be under control with medication. The rush of happiness and relief when I heard this led my thoughts to the idea of celebratory drinks. Those kind of thoughts have become few and far between for me these days but they're still hard to fight back when they do happen and I still get a feeling of victory when I don't give into them. ..General: I think I've done more shopping for myself this past week than I've done actual Christmas shopping. It's hard to pass up a good deal on things I need to buy anyways but I need to get going on getting gifts for other people :) 
**Triumph:** I'm back on the bike! Woohoo! The air is cold but damn it feels nice to ride again...**Struggle:** I've been on-and-off congested for the better part of three months. I'm tired of it and I can't wait to see a primary care doctor to get this (and other things) sorted out...**General:** It's my birthday tomorrow! I will not drink with y'all on this day!
Instead of alcohol I'm asking my fianc  to let me adopt a cat for my birthday. I have my fingers crossed    
**Struggle**: That anxiety I was sort of medicating with alcohol? Totally back and in some ways better but in other ways worse and in my face. But I've also been really stressed so there's that. I know I'll just be dealing with this for the rest of my life so I guess I'd better learn some better ways...&amp;#x200B;..**Triumph**: So proud of myself for taking some risks and making some big decisions...&amp;#x200B;..**General**: I had my first drinking dream this time around. The thing that struck me in the dream was that I disappointed my kid. So relieved to wake up.
Struggle: I have half a bottle of wine in my fridge that my MIL left in there from Thanksgiving. I don't want to throw it out cause it isn't mine so every time I open my fridge to get something I feel taunted. I believe in myself though and I know I'm not gonna drink it. I guess I'm just irritated that my mind works this way because normal people don't get anxious and cry when they see some wine in the fridge. .Triumph: I turned down plans to drink for my birthday this Friday and it felt really good. I was worried that I was going to give in to peer pressure and was even planning on going to a karaoke bar with friends and  just not drinking  but I'm not there yet. .General: I stopped drinking soda &amp; eating fast food last week and I am already starting to see the difference in my skin. It is the clearest it's been in months and I can't stop touching it.
**Struggle:**  My first cold morphed into a sinus infection.  I've been sick for over 3 weeks now.  I know antibiotics will only work if it's a bacterial infection so I'm just doing everything I can to rest and treat my body well.  So frustrated!!  All of the supplements I've bought don't seem to do a thing...**Triumph:**  Successfully navigated Turkey Day with the GF's family in Oklahoma.  They barely drink so it was nice not to have to worry about any real triggers...**General:**  Now that I'm seeing a therapist I'm getting good feedback about why my reactions to my relationship actually make sense which is validating.  But unpacking all of this definitely makes me aware that some changes I might want aren't currently an option for a variety of reasons and I'm left feeling a little critical and resentful.  So mindfulness to the rescue!  Working on staying present and appreciating our loving household.
Struggle: Money is tight. I should probably go back to working but it's stressful trying to establish safe reliable and affordable child care. My husband is depressed and hates his job. I'm struggling at effectively parenting my eldest child lately. ..Triumph: I've been outdoors the last two days due to hunting. I haven't got one and that stinks but truly just being outdoors and walking 5 miles a day really helps my seasonal depression...General: Atleast I'm sober. I'm so sober now that I forget how long I've been sober and it's not even something on my mind anymore. 
Struggle: Repairing the relationship with my husband that has been clouded and damaged by my drinking for the last 4 years.  All the connection closeness and intimacy I once felt towards people has been ruined by alcohol.  ..Triumph: 1 week alcohol-free!  Feels wonderful!  I am able to balance a heavy academic and work-load the last week successfully!  My energy and sleep is through the roof!  :)..General: Thankful for this community and all the wonderful people here for the support and constant posts!
Struggle: The temperature here has dropped and while i like winter it's difficult to stay outside for too long.  I like to hunt and standing still is bone chilling...Triumph: I'm coming up on two weeks sober this Friday. I've had some thoughts of drinking but so far I've been able to use tools I've learned here far more effectively than past attempts at sobriety. I was really and truly sick and tired of being sick and tired...General: as Christmas approaches I'm excited and nervous and hopeful in one messy ball! This year i decided to make my gifts for family members instead of buying cheap things. I think it's more personal and it gives me added distractions to keep me focused on sobriety and healing. ..Happy hump day everyone! 
**S:** Still haven't gotten my nursing license yet I'm going to get fingerprints taken again today...**T:**  I got my front yard raked up.  I didn't get around to the side or under the bushes but it looks like I'm done for the year (we got about half a foot of snow on the ground)...**G:**  One of my dogs is recovering from surgery and is wearing a cone of shame.  She's been using the cone to scoop up snow and toss it up in the air.  
Your kindness and compassion leak through in many ways not just tears.  :)..**Struggle:**  I have a tendency to obsess about the bigger life challenges and options than is healthy.     Is this job the right thing to do?  Would it be better if I moved into town?  Should I leave my husband?  If I do *x* then *y* will be an issue and *z* has to go etc...It's freakin' irritating as all hell. I guess I need to get back into some basic stretching and meditation to quiet the shit show in my mind...**Triumph:** I got the job interview for the very good job that I'm not sure I want.  I'm trying to make my brain shut up about it and not worry about choices until I actually have a job offer.  I am really happy at my current place of employment except for the lack of benefits.  ..**General:** Possums eat ticks.  
Not drinking today
**Struggle:** relapsing. Made it to 28 days then drank then a week then drank yesterday. And I think I might be getting fired soon. And I'm househunting and being shunted from place to place. The Airbnb I'm staying at is a scam and super super uncomfortable. ..**Triumph:** Laundry? Taking my meds? Moisturising my skin properly? I don't know. Definitely grateful for all of it. ..**General:** Looking for fun and challenging word games to play!
**Struggle:** Sometimes I just feel angry for no reason. I'll wake up and BAM. Just ANGRY. It can quickly turn into sadness anxiety or lack of motivation. Having BPD can suck ass bc I just want to be "normal" for longer periods of time...**Triumph:** I have been working on controlling my emotions mindfully. Someone told me that it takes time to adjust to difficult emotions without running from them immediately aka getting drunk at the slightest tingle of uncomfortable unexplained feelings. Meditation sessions have been a lifesaver. ..**General:** Life is good when I'm in control and clear headed. Life as a human will always have ups and downs. My relationship with myself and outlook on sober life is improving. I'm excited for the future. Accepting what I cannot change and working on what I can is my new motto.
Not much
I've been getting shuffled from doctor to doctor for 10 years for my back pain and just because I'm not in obvious pain the last one says "call if it gets worse"..Excuse me? I got referred from an ER. I couldn't stand up yesterday. What the fuck is worse? I'm doing literally everything you assholes tell me to do and you know what it does? Nothing. ..Maybe if someone has been in constant and unending agony for 10 years they idk get used to it? They grin and bear it? They know it's not going anywhere so it's pointless to whine about? ..So frustrated. All I want is vodka. It's quite seriously the only thing that even dulls this pain. I'm not interested in their opiates or opiods or whatever the fuck pills because they don't help either. ..I miss being able to drink responsibly so I could have an hour or two a couple of nights a week without pain. ..I hate this ..Sorry..I can't think of a triumph to counter this or i would put it here
Just struggling to stay afloat at the moment :'(
Struggle -.Had some rude customers and a stupid manager on the bar I work on tonight...Triumph -.When I got home I did some Yoga to de-stress and feel much better for it...General -..If anyone has any Yoga video recommendations I would love them. I currently use Yoga with Adrienne...I also stumbled upon a book last week called The One Thing and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for some motivational/focusing advice 
Dearest Mary I almost cried just reading what you wrote...I have way too much attachment for those beings who can't speak and can't control what we humans are capable of doing to them (intentionally or unintentionally).  Thank you for tending to him...**Struggle:** Not much!! Still trying to get the last 10% of my stuff settled in my new house trying to find places I can get the dog and me out to hike.  Oh here's one that surfaced as I typed.  My former spouse drove the U-Haul with all my stuff in it (I had the dog and cat) and he stayed for a week to help me get settled.  His help was immeasurable.  While we both know that we're better off not married to each other his being here and then leaving felt in some ways more final than our divorce a year ago.  We have maintained strong connectivity and now there's 900 miles between us.  That feels really hard and like I'm truly on my own for the first time in well over 30 years...**Triumph**: *I'm on my own for the first time in well over 30 years!* I'm grateful I gave myself two weeks before I started my new job to get my home in order -- that's really important for me and I'm pretty much there. Fur babies are adjusting pretty well.  Went on our first hike (short but at least something) today. And because I made a commitment to myself to intentionally find a sober community here I'm off to a Women's Meeting tonight (despite my lack of connection to AA)...**General:** The house I found on CL to rent is absolutely perfect for me; one I'd almost buy if I could.  The weather was great -- no snow or rain the entire time I was unpacking (snow's supposed to start next week and I'm actually excited; I haven't lived in snow since 1987). Today life is good.
Struggle / triumph/ general...My best friend moved away yesterday. I don't have a lot of friends and she was truely the best friend in every sense and she has gone. It won't be forever but with family issues going on and trying to navigate my world of sobriety it really could have been the excuse I needed to get drunk. I did buy a bottle of wine and I have drinks at home but I didn't touch them. I went to a yoga class. I cried. I went to sleep. I feel emotionally exhausted but I made it through without alcohol! ..I will not drink with you today!
I am so fucking proud of you too!
My struggle is that I still get trigged sometimes and have to fight it. I read a post on another subreddit about a guy who drank his rent money and is living in his car doing nothing but drinking. ..I'm so grateful to be soberbut there a teeny part of me that whispers in my ear how great that would be. No job no bills just drink and be numb. ..It frustrates me that I still have those thoughts and how much for a moment I want to give in. ..It passes quickly thankfully because I *don't* want that at all. Alcohol has stolen too much of my life already. ..
Triumph:  I'm noticing myself being more curious about other people's lives truly interested even thus cutting down the percentage of time I spend dwelling on my own issues.  I think others are noticing this too as I seem to be getting more social invitations lately.  Is that some law of attraction voodoo or what? Stop being a self-absorbed asshole and magically attract cool people into your life! ..Struggle:  Anxiety. Not as intense but still a regular visitor. Especially social anxiety. ..Of interest:  I heard a radio story about someone who stopped drinking a few years ago with the aid of  micro-dosing  LSD which means as I understand it taking a small enough dose that causes several hours of very mild subtle euphoria and no hallucinations or  trip.  I can't remember the amount that equates to. The guy claimed zero negative side-effects (aside from the legal risk) and said he continues to take a micro-dose a day because it prevents his depression from coming back.
