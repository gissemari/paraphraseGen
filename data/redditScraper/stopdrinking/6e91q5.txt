I realize this is a novel but I hope it helps. Antabuse really helped me stay on track and sober but I realize it won't be the same for everybody. Also you need to get this pill prescribed along with a test for liver function. With insurance 90 pills was around 60 bucks not terribly expensive. So when I first realized I needed to get sober I googled "pills that make you violently ill when you drink". I have always been a person that is very self aware and the first one to admit my faults. I don't live in a dream land where I'm the victim everyone is out to get me and nothing is my fault. A lot of my struggles have been directly caused my own actions not all but most. So knowing that I have little to no impulse control and if I get a thought in my head to do something bad (drinking skipping school drugs etc.) I've already done the bad thing before I even had a chance to negotiate with myself to possibly not do  the terrible thing that makes me feel terrible. It was almost instinct at the point second nature a habit so far formed that you don't even notice it just like breathing. So while googling I came across Antabuse specifically used for treating alcoholism. I sat on it for a while before I even mentioned it to my psychiatrist because for a time there I didn't even want to get better. I was content to wallow in my misery. It felt normal at that point. I had been running on misery for a long time. So before this I hadn't gone more than a day sober in over four years. I drank heavily usually all day at work lied and hid bottles everywhere. I was exhausted. And I couldn't do it anymore. So I finally brought it up to her can I be prescribed Antabuse. So first off to get this prescription you need to get a liver function test and of course even at 22 mine wasn't normal. Before I could even talk myself out of it  I went directly to the lab with my blinders on got my test done and called my doctor for the prescription. Got it filled the next day and took it in the morning right when I woke before I was even aware of what was going on. My good self was essentially pulling a fast one over my bad self before it had time to take control. So Antabuse stays in your system for two weeks and it's supposed to make you violently ill if you drink. For me if I drank on it it made my heart beat very fast. I had chest pains and my entire body would turn bright red and hot. It was scary seeing your own body react that way to alcohol. It was the physical manifestation of the invisible poison. I had only ever been exposed to its detrimental effects in my own mind not on my body. So I really had no choice to drink because of you drink to much on it you will die. I'm pretty sure it makes it so your body can't break down the alcohol so it's a definite no no. On days I felt weak or tempted I didn't have the choice to drink if I had taken my pill anytime in the past two weeks. So I was forced to focus on more effective coping mechanisms and usually by the next day the wave of weakness had passed. Antabuse really held me stand steady when I was catastrophically off balance. I could not have stayed sober this long without it. Now I only take it once a week just as a reminder and I don't even really think about drinking because I have cultivated so many other aspects of my life it seems full now. Sorry for the rant I just know the type of person I am and for someone who struggles with impulse control it was a god send.

Antabuse helped me break out of a very dark cycle years ago.  It may have saved my life. I really felt there was no way I could go one day without alcohol.  Being forced to abstain helped me realize I could.  I was the kind of person who had strong resolve in the morning but crumbled in the evenings.  Having the resolve in the a.m. allowed me to take my little pill happily. I know longer take it now.  I eventually started going to meetings and spending a lot of time on SD.  That was the next big leap for me.  It felt good to abstain from alcohol without being forced by a chemical flowing through my body.  
Yes I agree. I barely take it now and used to have to everyday. And now I'm this r/stop drinking a lot! 
was magic for me. remove the decision proceed with life. train your brain that there is no reward for the craving. Prior efforts to stop drinking were banging my head against the wall. Wish i took it 20 yrs before I did -  but no one mentioned it. I read about it in an article once. 
I have it too. I don't need to take it every day but when I'm having a rough time with cravings I take it. Just so I have the extra incentive to not drink!
No I really didn't just make sure your beauty products or anything you use to wash your body/ put on your skin doesn't have alcohol in it. Like I used make up wipes with alcohol in it and my face turned bright red and started stinging. That's all though really nothing measurable.
