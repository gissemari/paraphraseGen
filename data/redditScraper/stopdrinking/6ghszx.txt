I'm by no means new to recovery. My DOC was heroin and I am over 2 and a half years clean from opiates and illicit substances. However a little over a year ago I picked up drinking and all was well and good until about 4 months ago when my drinking started to escalate. Drinking 5-6 days a week blacking out drunk driving terrible hangovers the whole 9. I'm no stranger to alcoholic behavior either. I racked up plenty of arrests during the front-end to middle of college because of my tendencies to drink as much as I can in as little amount of time possible...So now I find myself in a familiar situation. Today is my second day without a drink. I plan on going to a meeting in about an hour. Yesterday night was the first meeting I've been to in years. The thing I'm struggling with right now is friendships. I know I can't hang out with my friends at least not right now while I'm new and fresh in sobriety because I know they are drinking as I type and I know putting myself in that situation will lead me to drink. In fact I want to go over there so badly but I can't for the sake of my own wellbeing. So now I'm faced with the situation of finding AA buddies and I hope I can do it quickly...I know I've got too much good going on for me to screw this up. I know if I keep drinking I will get an arrest that which put my studies and my career on hold or worse. I know if I keep drinking I'll develop a physical addiction and dig myself deeper than I've ever been. I need to quit now and I am ready to live a sober life again...This was more so a rant than anything a way to get something off my chest. Cheers or not cheers I guess...
