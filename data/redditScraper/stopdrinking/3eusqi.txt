I ended a relationship with my gf of 2 years today. It is very painful. I feel like I'll be alone forever now of course. ..My addiction isn't alcohol its sex but that doesn't matter though its still an addiction. For us it was more painful than alcohol because the relapses were cheating porn and masturbation along with the forever threat of 'this might happen again'. ..I'm 6 years sober from alcohol so I'm familiar with the program. I didn't take the steps and the work seriously until I got into SLAA. This addiction rendered me powerless and broke me down more so than alcohol ever did. I stopped drinking cold turkey and couldn't understand what powerless meant. I now know too well. ..The premise was / is to focus on sobriety for a year work the steps and see where I'm at then. The break was a few weeks ago but the finality of it was today when she actually left. We tried living together but I couldn't handle that either. I'm an emotional roller coaster and the stress of it was causing me to act out. ..I loved her like I've never loved anyone before and right now i think will ever love again I'm over 40 btw. ..I have good support from my brothers in the program who all believe I made the right move. They never told me to make this move I made it on my own. They were skeptical that it would work from the onset and told me so. ..Skeptical me addict me say they did this to me on purpose so that I would be alone. They're there on the phone an in meetings for me but what about when they're not? Where are they tomorrow morning when I wake up crying? Where will they be and I'm 55 living in my house alone? Will they be here when I've had enough and decide to take my own life?..That's angry me I know its not true. I know they are there for me and they love me. They believe and a tiny part of me does to that I'm doing this for the greater good. That once I get my head clear I'll be a better person and make better decisions. ..I'm so skeptical of that too. I realize working the steps changes you for the better. They seem simple but not easy. How do you remember what to do all the time? When I'm stressed I don't think straight at all how will i remember what to do?..And what about the areas that the steps don't cover. Will i become more loving as a result? ..One common flaw of this relationship was that I put us on the shelf when things got comfortable and things got comfortable very quickly for me. I was seeking comfortable. She did not want that at all. Will the steps fix that? I'm passionate when I'm passionate its not on 100% of the time will the steps fix that?..I know they won't I'm rambling and venting here. I know what they wont do. I know our relationship ended mostly because of incompatibilities but i'm angry and hurt we couldn't overcome them. They seem simple but yet they broke us. ..Also I'm working on myself you weren't working on yourself (yes I'm speaking as if she's reading this). If I fixed myself how were you going to get better? I continue to think if I fixed myself and loved her enough I could have been there to support her listen to her and help where I can. I thought that that would be enough to help her overcome her issues or at least been a living example of getting better which would in turn make her desire to get better stronger. ..Day 0 of the rest of my live starts now I guess. Lets see what I can make of it. Let's see if I cannot screw it up even more. ..Thanks for reading if anyone read this far. .....

Doing all 12 steps helped me in every part of my life. They didn't completely fix anything (except my drinking) but they helped everything. When I'm in doubt as to the next right thing I consult my higher power by picking up the phone and calling someone I trust or spilling my guts in a meeting. I try to pray on my knees every day but my most effective prayers by far are the ones I say with my hands and feet.
Hiya wow. Great post. Thanks for sharing. ..One of the great things about all of the recovery programs is that we start to learn how to live differently. Like /u/pretendingtobenormal typed one thing we all do is talk to others more: among other things...I feel what you typed. Sometimes life is so friggin' hard. Luckily we have people like ourselves to share with. I can't begin to comment on whether your choice is good or bad. However you did say you talked to some people before and took time to make a decision. You didn't have to face it alone and you are not facing the after alone either. ..We are not alone. That continues to be so powerful for me. No matter how hard things are I know that I can at least vent but more often I know I can have a conversation with someone about serious stuff. While I might not always get perfect answers it is so powerful to just have a positive healthy conversation...Again like /u/pretendingtobenormal typed the steps have given me a foundation from which to build a life to make decisions and to face what comes my way. As long as I do what others have done before me I will have a good day and tomorrow will have less drama. As long as I continue to try to do the next right thing tomorrow will have less wreckage. As long as I am honest to myself and keep myself 'right-sized' I will cause less harm to others. ..The other great thing I get from these programs of recovery is this "one day at a time" thing. I know that I can start fresh again each day. If I didn't do everything right today I know that I can work a bit harder tomorrow and have better results...So relax. Take a deep breath and have a good rest of the day. Tomorrow will be a new day.
