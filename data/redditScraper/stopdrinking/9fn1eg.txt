Twelve evenings down without wine and tonight makes 13.  I'm starting to feel less strain over it and I'm not struggling with stopping to buy wine after work.  But oh my goodness do I have to keep up my guard.  When I get to feeling like this there are so many ways that I can slide right down that slippery slope...&amp;#x200B;..Who else started September 1? How's it going for you?

Day before.  Was also probably doing a bottle and a half of wine a night.  Doing ok but got hit with the thought of stopping to get some tonight and let it go thankfully.  
Congratulations!
September was going ok had 2 relapses involving friends but that's still 11 days out of 13 not drinking this month.  Trying to stay positive. ..Had a strong urge to go buy some tonight got into the car and everything at the last minute I decided it was not wise to go to the grocery store right now.  So I turned and drove to Home Depot instead ended up spending $6 on live flowers they were all $1.  Really happy about that they were on special so I now have a cluster of pretty flowers to plant tomorrow. Versus an empty bottle to throw away.   ..&amp;#x200B;
Started August 31. Taking it one day at a time. I just keep playing the tape forward when I feel like I'm slipping - imagining the hangover and knowing how disappointed I'll be in myself. Also I'll have less money to spend on fun things this weekend - like some more Lego!
