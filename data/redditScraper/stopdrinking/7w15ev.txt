Waking up and not being hungover is not the only thing keeping me sober tonight. But it's a big motivator. .But I think about before I relapsed and how good I was feeling how mentally foggy I had been and hadn't even realized it. I can't wait for that clarity to come back. .Going through some minor withdrawals but I KNOW they are worth it. .IWNDWYT!

Hey there!..Congratulations getting back on the wagon. I had to reset my counter yesterday but I managed to keep my head clean today too. ..Is it possible these mild withdrawals might need some medical attention?  Just wanted to voice a little concern for ya. Don't be afraid to ask for help if those symptoms intensify okay?  All the best!
I believe in you bro. Stay strong and beat the fuck out that habit.
Awesome to have you back! Ha I've heard many good things about La Croix. It was on sale today near me. Maybe it's time I bite the proverbial bullet. 
I also am a huge proponent of actually remembering the tv shows I watched!
