Hi!  I've struggled with alcohol for TOO many years.  Had too many problems with it and recently I just had enough.  I know if I take that one drink I'm done.  I'm on day 6 of my sobriety and the first few days were tough but I made it through the worst.  Sleeping is still a struggle but I get up at 5:30 every morning to get my kids ready for school and drink lots of coffee! :)  One thing I am experiencing is heightened sense of emotions trying to deal with everything I have numbed with alcohol.  I'm already an emotional person so it's been a bit tough.  But keeping myself busy and I'm currently on my second book reading You can break that habit and be free.  It's keeping me very positive and I'm Christian I might add (not sure if that's allowed here). Anyway just looking for a place of support.  I've tried AA and I'm not fond of it.  I have gone to Celebrate Recovery though.  Thanks for listening!

Congratulations on your success so far that's huge!  And welcome to SD this place is great for support and encouragement.
Well done on 6 days you are doing great! I am a mum my whole day is flat out busy with kids &amp; sometimes drama I know how tough it gets just remember you are doing great....find some time 2 relax take a bath take a few deep breaths you can do this! Drinking does not make it better or make it go away...I find going 2 bed early if I'm having a bad day helps me &amp; wake up feeling better....you got this  
Congratulations !  Keep doing it !
Congrats! I am also a newbie and cannot begin to describe how great the people on SD have been. It is so refreshing to not be judged.  I look forward to hitting my inbox every morning instead of counting the hours till 7 a.m. when the stores can sell me my daily first dose of poison..Keep strong!  I look forward to seeing you here often.
