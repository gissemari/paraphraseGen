I keep singing this part of Against Me!'s Borne on the FM Waves of the Heart ..*Anxiety Anxiety you give me no mercy.*..*Grind my teeth smooth and flat in my sleep.*..*We took some pills to calm us down.*..*Then we needed help to come back up.*..*Just trying to stay in control of the situation.*....I haven't been able to sleep right. I'm either anxious or depressed. Thursday night I took some Valerian to sleep and ended up having the most vicious pre-sleep visuals that I had to get out of bed and eat a bowl of cereal watch some TV and lurk reddit. Visuals straight out of Bosch's depictions of Hell. All night I was tossing and turning on the verge of sleep but never quite there. I was able to get in a decent hour or so before my alarm went off for work. ...I made it to work on time where I was handed a beer taster for pre-shift. I'm a server and we're given a beer taster each morning shift so we know our way around the extensive beer list. I went along with the tasting protocol though I mimed drinking it and placed it on the bar. I didn't WANT to drink it I just hated that I had to hide that I didn't want to drink it. I told my manager I wasn't feeling well so I didn't want to close and they had an extra server so I was able to go home. Yay. ...Bought some Benedryl got on the train and walked home ready for sleep. My roommates locked the back door and my phone was at 1%. Shit. I texted my boyfriend right before my phone died and I was stuck outside in the beautiful summer weather (I am so WHINY lately too) with only a pen and my server pad. So I begin to write all my anxious feelings down which are connected to the last night that I drank.  It helped. I really want to work through a lot of these emotions that I feel about drinking being taken advantage of by men the FEAR of it happening again and how to move past this... But I don't know how to get to or speak to a therapist in my current immigrant situation. US -> Canada. ...I also spoke with my SO about my anxieties and how drinking makes it worse. He said "Well don't drink then. I'm not planning on drinking until we go to Vegas." I told him I wasn't planning on drinking and I didn't WANT to... Though I didn't say that I thought I had a problem (which I do) and was thinking of going back to AA (which I want to do). I don't know how to breach this subject with him. I think he would support me but also judge me in some way due to lack of understanding. ...Also this damn Vegas trip. I'm so excited to go. It's a punk music festival in downtown Vegas and I absolutely LOVE live music and it has been sorely missing in my life since I moved here. However it's Vegas with all of our friends here and I don't know how I'm going to handle that. I'm dealing with it by repeating ONE DAY AT A TIME! However my thoughts will often lean into "Well if I can quit for two weeks then I can moderate my drinking" or "I'll only drink on trips" or "I'll only drink with my boyfriend around" or "I'll only drinking beer and spritzers" or "this will be my last hurrah then I'll stop". ...I told my best friend last night on text. She has been through rehab and struggles with drinking herself. She says she'll be proud of me. It's the first person besides you guys that I've told. ...Which is totally fucked. Normal drinkers don't think that way alcoholics do. Even now as I type that "WELL MAYBE I'M DIFFERENT!!!" Ugh. Off to work to serve booze and food. Seeing people get sloppy drunk really makes me feel better about my decision. That seems so sadistic. ...Edit: I re-read this. I have wanted to drink a bit but more than anything I want the anxiety to stop. I don't want to feel like I've been beaten by alcoholism. I go through waves of being disgusted by the idea of drinking to wanting to have a beer in the sun to wanting to pound a bottle of vodka and tell the world to fuck off.

Hey man two quick things:..1) I struggle with anxiety too. It's easy to self-medicate with alcohol but the easy way out is never the best way out. Maybe see someone about your anxiety?..2) It's definitely not sadistic to feel better about your decision when you see the negative effects caused by drinking in other people. It's rational.
Exercise helps me a lot with anxiety. I can't say enough about it...Your emotions are likely going to continue to be all over the place for the next month or two.  I'm not saying that to scare you I'm saying it so you expect it. It's normal.  I had my first ever panic attack a couple weeks after quitting.  Ever have one of those?  Holy cow I thought that people who complained about panic attacks were just being whiny until I had one myself. Those SUCK.  Telling myself "This is normal and this will eventually pass" helped a lot...Hang in there.  There is light at the end of the tunnel.  Takes a while to get there but it's worth it.
