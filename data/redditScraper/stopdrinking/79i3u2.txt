I struggle with crippling anxiety barely able to live inside my own head. For three years I drank nearly every day just to shut myself off. Finally I decided to go to the Dr. My condition is quite strange... I'll go a week or two feeling great. Confident social and super motivated. I then fall into the crippling anxiety and can hardly do anything. I shake become socially awkward question my every move break down and question my life in every facet. I still have the problem but medication and talking has helped a little. I sure hope I can get it under control because it's so incredibly miserable when I go through an episode. Not drinking has been a tremendous blessing and I don't want my condition to push me back to the booze. I need to conquer my mental issue just don't know what else to do. Anyone have a similar problem or anyone in the medical field that can shed some light? Y'all are amazing and I'm glad to be by your side through this journey.

Seeing a psychiatrist made all the difference for me. I hope things improve for you. 
Congratulations on nearly 90 days!  You really should only rely upon medical advice but I will say that it sounds like it *may* be worth investigating whether what you're describing is a form of bipolar disorder.  Or it could be something organic.  Either way your doctor is best positioned to diagnose and treat whatever is going on.  
I just made the connection that the OTC  sleeping pills I was using were triggering major anxiety on the days after I used them.  I had to stop them because I was another prescription for something else hey no anxiety. Started taking them again woops anxiety is back.  ..If I have to give up coffee next I will be super pissed!!
