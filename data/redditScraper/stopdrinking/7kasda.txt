So little background I thought I had alcohol problems but never full blow alcoholic. I had quit drinking for a month when I got ultimatum cold turkey. Then relapsed and didn't even notice how 4 months went by with me drinking every night again. ( I used to drink 24 pack every day now just 4 pack but still )...Anyway came to realization that I love alcohol bit too much and this relationship is not good for me. Been sobber for 2 days so far. Today bit struggling but oh well I know first week is hardest.
