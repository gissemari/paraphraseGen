Hello peoples thanks for being there...Some of you have read my crap others maybe not. I have a tendency to be wordy so I'll try to make this short:..I felt like dogshit for almost two weeks. This is my second go around and I absolutely experienced the [kindling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindling_(sedative%E2%80%93hypnotic_withdrawal) effect. If you've relapsed every time you come back to sobriety it's worse. Happened to me...But now at three weeks my head is straight my body is functioning properly I haven't used the scrub brush in the toilet for a while and I'm at the gym regularly. I'm hungry AF all the time and I'm building muscle and endurance...So first off thanks to all of you. I don't go to meetings you're my people. My friends don't know I quit don't feel like having any kind of stupid conversation about it. It's not that they're not good friends but they all drink and I'm not trying to prove any point. ..If you're like I was and you're coming to this board drunk and bummed because you know you need to quit seriously after a few weeks you're gonna be stoked you did. If you're drinking a metric shit ton PLEASE either taper down or go to a doctor. Quitting cold turkey for some of us is NOT a good idea. I went through hell and back and am just thankful I didn't have a seizure. I could almost see that happening if I fucked up and drank again and then quit...See? I can't ever keep this stuff short...Thanks again!

I  kind of expected to have seizure but didn't. It's been 5 days and I am just now feeling better. I tried to locate a meeting but they were either too late in the day or too far. This isy meeting on the chat room. Dr appointment tomorrow to get back on the right track. Thanks for posting.
