It is so important NOT to listen to your AV in the early days of a quit. I can't stress this enough! Your AV will try to convince you that drinking will make you feel better. You'll want to believe it as you struggle to get a foothold on sobriety in the early days. However it is so important to work through this discomfort and experience the promised land that is sobriety. ..And most importantly it only gets BETTER as you accumulate sober days. ..Don't listen to the AV's LIES and give yourself a chance to experience life as it was meant to be lived.
