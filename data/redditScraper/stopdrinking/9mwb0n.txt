Since I made the incredibly positive and rewarding choice to stop drinking one year ago I have had to reset my badge five times. That's a much higher success rate than I anticipated and a far better outcome than if I had never tried. I feel like I've rediscovered the real me and every time I slipped I have thankfully been able to find myself again and quickly get back on track. ..I honestly could not have done that without you all. I mean that. You stranger have helped save me just by reading this and by sharing your own  struggles and successes. We are not alone. Thank you so much. ..IWNDWYT
