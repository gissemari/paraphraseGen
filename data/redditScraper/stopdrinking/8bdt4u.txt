It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Struggle:** My mother invited me to go to England with her then uninvited me for no particular reason and now pretends that she never invited me in the first place (classic alcoholic family behavior). So I took her to the airport and I am now alone in her house in Florida. ..I happen at the same time to have taken a couple of weeks off work so I am all alone with no obligations in a tropical paradise. Almost three years into my journey of sobriety I am shocked not by a sudden urge to drink alcohol specifically but by an urge to misbehave in general. It makes me realize how true the saying is:  It doesn't matter how far down the road you are we are all still the same distance from the ditch. ..**Triumph:** I have not had a drink despite the  no one would know  factor. I have found that maintaining a daily routine getting up early getting dressed making my meals and doing my nighttime routine even though I am by myself has helped. Also I keep reminding myself that I have experienced the  fun  of binge drinking alone in this very house and have also suffered the terrible hangovers. In other words I have tasted the forbidden fruit and it didn't actually taste that great...**General:** Recently I re-watched the unbelievably [brilliant scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifoN_vDtgiQ)  from Apocalypse Now of the tiger in the jungle. This is exactly how I feel about alcohol my feeling of security is false. It is out there in the jungle and I can't see it but it is watching me...Never get out of the boat!.
----------immediate responses--------

Never get out if the boat. Truer words have never been spoken. 
Ooh sounds pretty cool!  Don't you paint?  Collage!  Did you bring your stuff?  Break it out!  Raid the magazine subscriptions!  Go wild!  I just know you'll settle in after a couple days and really enjoy the peace and the topicality of it all.  I [got a feeling!](https://youtu.be/3OnnDqH6Wj8) C'mon crank the stereo!       
I absolutely love your saying about being close to the ditch. I'll never forget that now. Excellent on you for not giving in!! Geez that's crappy of your mil also :(. ..My struggle today has just been this feeling of melancholy and I know it's because I fell off the wagon two weeks ago. Also emotions seem quite raw when you're sober all the time but I wouldn't change it. Said I'd start a journal today but the notebook is still sitting on the coffee table. I've been watching a documentary and hanging with baby all day. ..Triumph: a random fb message from my ex husband asking how not drinking was going. Which is huge from him we both drank our faces off through our relationship and have a son together and well it's just nice to be civil after being through so much bad/sad with a person. 
Sorry about not getting to go to England. But am proud of you for staying sober! ..Struggle: I have been working ALOT recently and have only made it to one single AA meeting. I still havent found a sponser and most lklely wont have time for another meeting till NEXT tuesday. I am newly sober and as much as my husband tries... he's not an alcoholic and doesn't understand why I can't just control myself and drink every once in a while. ..Triumph: I am 5 days sober and the headaches finally went away tonight (been consistent since day 1). ..General Musings: I'm going on trip with my mom leaving on Thursday and coming home Monday. I'm super excited because I'm going to see my sister and meet her new boyfriend. Luckily I always made a point to not drink in front of her and so not drinking over the weekend will be easy. 
Sup guys hope y'all are doing good today. ..**Struggle:**I find myself future tripping often to those moments when the cravings are so hard. I had 7 days of continuous sobriety on Sunday but in the evening cravings came hard and I didn't have my guard up...**Triumph:** Those 7 days also are something that I'm hugely grateful for. They showed me I can do this and to be honest I felt they were a start for something bigger. Even though I relapsed on Sunday I feel I'm still on that journey that started with those 7 days...**General**: I'm two years in a university that I'm slowly realizing is not for me. Trying to change careers in the future probably. I want to be a medical doctor. I want to be a sober doctor who can help out those in need of one. ..Have a good one guys!
**Struggle:** Anxiety dermatillomania and body dysmorphia have cranked into a high gear recently. I have struggled with all of these for all of my life and it gets especially bad right before my period. The dermatillomania is embarassing I need to get a gel manicure because my hands are fucking bleeding at work. The body dysmorphia is a big internal struggle. I am told by others that I am a pretty slim woman in the prime of my life but I obsess about some fault and it takes over and makes me feel embarrassed to exist. It's embarrassing to talk about because I sound vain or petty. But it's all linked together. And all part of why I drank. To turn down the volume...**Triumph:** I started seeing a new trainer to get control over my pain and scoliosis. They do amazing work and I have hope that I can improve and feel better about myself through feeling better and standing taller...**General:** First world problems and overall things are going so much better than they were. I have a lot to be grateful for and do actively try to take time out to note the good stuff and enjoy the small things.
**S:**  Hanging on in nursing school by a very slim margin. It's still possible that I pass but I'm not so sure it's going to happen.  I'm not sure how I'm going to react if I fail... or pass.  I've never really been in a situation like this.  Either way the danger of relapse is there and I've been attempting to keep things in perspective.  If I don't drink today... it's a good day...**T:**  Did a presentation on PTSD and it went well...**G:** In Mexico family members can send one of their alcoholic members to rehab against their will.  If anyone is able to confirm or deny this I'd be very interested to learn more about it.
First time doing this and all I can picture is being stuck in the middle of the ocean taking on water and @sfgirlmary saying Never get out of the boat!..Struggle: On Day 2341 of sobriety and also of not being able to sleep through the night.  You win some you lose some!..Triumph: I haven't gone on vacation in a LONG time and just booked flights last night! ..General: I don't know what I would do without my car and it's radio.  It's my heaven.....
**Struggle:** I m in the dumps for the third week running now. I struggle so hard every single day to get up and to stay standing. I just want relief...**Triumph:** I talked to a friend who is on a sick leave for depression (I m on a sick leave for exhaustion) and told her about this daily fight to change my thoughts emotions and behaviour. As one who should know how hard this is she was really impressed. That made me feel like I ve actually achieved something the last 17 months. And I have! I work two days a week I do chores I ve begun writing again I m here for my family I ve lost weight - I m sitting right here writing this! This *is* an achievement!..**General:** I love you guys...u/sfgirlmary I admire your strenght and perseverance. You rock!
Hey guys Happy Hump Day!.**Struggle** So far I am not having many struggles with my sobriety but I think that's because I haven't really put myself in any drinking situations. I'm starting to panic about a family night I'm hosting at my new house next week...my extended family are big drinkers and they will wonder straight away why I'm not drinking. I'm also at that stage in my life that if I am not drinking I must be pregnant ffs SMH .**Triumph** Started baking again on my way to getting my drivers license and applied for a new job because the one I'm in right now is soul destroyingly boring and mundane. No word back on it yet but fingers crossed I get an interview! .**General** Glad to be staying active on SD it def helps and keeps me accountable...i never realised how much excitement I would get seeing my badge increase everyday! Have a good Wednesday Folks! 
Dilute your drink with 80% water to kill the craving. You will be surprised what it can do to your urge! Do this every time when you could not resist! It is all in your BRAINS! Cheers
**Struggle:** It's my sister's mother-in-law's funeral today...**Triumph:** I've been out on my bike 5 times in the last week. Finally the weather has got so I can get out again...**General:** Lose weight fast on the Adam Ant Diet...Don't chew ever don't chew ever...
Love that movie! Chef was right - "Never get out of the boat"!!
Struggle: feeling frustrated because I'm taking steps towards better health but not seeing the results mood keeps dipping low and I'm struggling to feel hopeful and positive about my future...Triumph: six months sober though!..General: didn't have to put out my recycling bin tonight ... such a change from my old drinking days where I was constantly figuring out how to get rid of/hide empties!!
Struggle: I'm having mad anxiety right now because I'm headed to work and there was a mishap I had to deal with before my day off yesterday. I did my best but will likely be discussing it with my boss today at some point. Uhg. I truly need to return to therapy. I know it's not a big deal but I get so stressed and anxious.. Just looking forward to this day being over. I have to watch out because I've been really quick to lose my temper lately and there is no harm in counting to 3 taking a deep breath and fresh look at the situation....Triumph: Still not drinking! And had a really productive day off yesterday....General: I need to start being a better friend to some. I wasn't in the right state of mind before but now I'm trying to reach out more. My best friend is moving away at the end of the month. She reached out to me last night to hang out and bake together but I was busy. I feel a little guilty about that but I truly was busy and she understood. I have plans with an old friend tonight and bowling Saturday! I don't want to overdo it. I need to put my needs first and make sure I am ok. ...
S - Not able to sleep through the night right now. This always happens during the week when I don't drink and I never attributed it to being sober. Much better to be tired than to be hungover. Up at 5am this morning to write a paper...T - I've never been able to stay sober for the weekend. Sunday - Thursday I can do it especially if I've totally embarrassed myself while drunk the weekend before. Friday I have plans to hang out with a friend order takeout drink tea and watch movies. We used to get together on the weekend "go out to dinner" and stay up until 2am drinking. I'm excited to not be hungover at all this weekend...G - I've been reading this sub for about a year but never engaged. You all are great inspiring and resilient. I just really appreciate the openness and honesty about this experience. It continues to be an essential support for me. So thank you!

**Struggle** Sick of the endless cold weather. And there's snow snow and more snow forecast for this weekend...**Triumph** I feel like I've set a really good example for SO who has taken some actions to improve himself lately that a few years ago I'd never have thought he'd try. I'm really proud of him of me and of us as a couple this week. ..**General** Looking forward to teaching step tonight after work. Back in December I was still not free from the demon but I'm proud of the groundwork I was laying for myself to do better by getting involved at the gym and taking steps to work on myself. 
Struggle: My boss is a bit of a hardass and is hard on you for mistakes and  stupid questions.  I have a cold and went to a concert last night so I got minimal sleep. I'm worried today's performance at work will not be up to par...Triumph: Despite this tough boss of mine and the stress of the job I have successfully been weaning off my anxiety meds. I have been concerned about going back to my old ways but I feel I have enough resources to survive. Plus being sober certainly helps...General: My brother got engaged recently. We're all going out for a celebratory dinner which I'm happy about. It's been a while since we've all gotten together as there are a lot of egos and baggage in family. I hope the winds are changing and we can get back to how we used to be. 
For perhaps the first time in a long time I can say I've had a few triumphs. :)..It has now been over a week since I last had a drink *and* I went to the gym yesterday. I also went for a walk on my lunch break to maximize calorie burn and researched healthy snacks I can make for my husband. I have a general idea of how and what I will eat as well and I *think* I can reach a healthy weight by mid-June. :)..I start a new medication this morning so I'm hoping it helps to steady me as I sort my life out.
General :   ..Found out my bachlorette party is going to be this weekend. My sisters and mom are coming up for a night out in nyc. We'll see a show and get dinner. It's as low key as you can get so I'm hoping I stick to my plan. Lately drinking has left me with such....idk such a loss of dignity. The last thing I want is that standard Bride Gets Shit faced At The Bachlorette Party shame.  ..Struggle:   ..I'm a woman in tech and I gotta be honest. It kinda fucking sucks. I love what I work on I love the company I work for. But its always like being a foreigner where no matter how well I may  know their language I'll never really be one of them. It's so lonely. I'm thankfully a pretty solitary person but today it's wearing on me.   ..Triumph : got nothing today. I'm tired I need coffee I'm worried about the Bach party and whether my sister's invited my fianc 's brother's girlfriend and if not I'm dreading the fallout from that next time I'm with his side of the family. I'm so tired of being on the front line of this wedding. I didn't plan the fucking thing go yell at the people who did.
Struggle: I've been dealing with body image issues lately. Losing weight and getting in shape has made me more critical of my body and how I look now than I ever was when I was overweight and didn't really care. ..Triumph: I was able to recognize that putting myself down is a tactic my asshole brain likes to do to get what it wants. If I can make myself feel bad enough and like a failure then maybe I'll decide that I'm not worth the effort anymore. Well fuck that because I am worth it and I know it! And I need to give a big shout out to the wonderful and awesome u/Lee_in_NY for her kind words and cheering me on yesterday in the midst of her own hectic life and dental troubles...General: &gt;I am shocked not by a sudden urge to drink alcohol specifically but by an urge to misbehave in general...I feel you on this one big time Mary. I feel like I've been so "good" and trying to improve for so long I want to do something bad for once. Unfortunately being bad for me is usually pretty self destructive and not a great idea in the long run. ..And holy shit Never get out of the boat! that takes me back. My friend used to have a print out of a tiger peering through the tall grass with Never get out of the boat! printed on it hanging in her kitchen. We used to say it to each other all the time when getting out of the car :)  
Struggle:..Feel like I'm off a bit trying to find my groove with work (a big struggle right now feeling unproductive) Weight loss (I have gone slightly up instead of down and I'm going back to what was working in October when I simply logged my calories every day and tried to stay under my goal. I am subscribed to loseit Keto c25k and every sub I'm on including this is filled with posts of people who lose 25 pounds in the last week or some shit. I fucking run 3 miles 3 times a week for fuck's sake and I don't eat that badly just a little too much I guess). I was going to list other mild complaints but I think that's enough for now!...Triumph:.I feel pretty good. The spring weather had a dramatic effect on my overall mood. Coming up on a year!...General:.I'm going to make a real effort to look outward more and try to help others. This last year has been great for looking inward. But maybe it's possible to do a little too much of that. 
**Triumph:** I've figured out the trick to my diet and it turns out it wasn't a trick at all. Simple moderation on sugars starches and grains does wonders! Also my cat purrs all the time when I'm home and I love it!..**Struggle:** I named my cat Chihiro but I'm having a really hard time sticking with that name. It just doesn't feel right. At the end of the day cats don't respond to names as readily as dogs so I can call her whatever I want. It's split between Hermione Ellie and Ophelia at this point...or something that fits. ..**General:** I cannot recommend [Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ym3LoSj9Xj8) on Netflix enough. It's a great rom-com series about a 'nice-guy' and an alcoholic woman fall for each other. Seeing not only her struggle with alcoholism but his struggle to understand her alcoholism (and what alcoholism truly means) is super refreshing. The unexpected pitfalls and experiences of alcoholics are rarely handled with the weight and nuance they deserve and when combined with romance it's nice to see flawed people taken seriously instead of played for laughs.
Mary I am both shaking my head at your Mom's actions... and pleased for you that you get some you time in a warm and lovely spot... silver linings I guess. and OMG yes the "urge to misbehave in general"... yup. that's a place I know all too well - on most Fridays actually. The urge to go and blockade a coal mine or such is pretty strong right now :)..Struggle: I am really feeling a need to change things up in my life. Drinking was a way of masking the "same shit different day" tenor of the routine I've been in for a decade [work/parent/work/parent..wash rinse repeat]. I've almost finished sorting out some actual physical space to take up my music poetry painting and craftwork again now I need to carve out the time and also make the effort...but it always seems there's something else I *should* be doing that's either work or parenting. I think this is my mission for the next part of the journey to make finding that time and using it well a priority...Triumph: For the first time since I don't know when I am NOT behind in any major way on a current client or contract - the process of scaling back one major client really applying myself to getting up-to-date on others letting go of a couple of things that would have been LOTS of time and stress for very very little money and gaining a couple of small but interesting and enjoyable now-and-then clients is paying off. I have a new system for keeping track of my to-do and due lists that is also making things feel less out of control [blu tack and lists on my desk wall combined with organising actually workable deadlines that take into account what else is on the list instead of offering to do everything for everyone right now]...General: Kiddo's Trust matters got sorted out with the new trustee late last week so I am now able to confidently plan on all the fees and uniform purchases and laptop and every other thing for her starting at a good private highschool next year being paid for by the trust. As a sole parent that works freelance this feels huge - I almost feel guilty that this can all be afforded now so easily. It feels important to recognise that for all the suffering the ex and his family put us through and all the years of having to be so very strong and fight the legal fights this is the blessing that starts a new chapter. Struggle can be addictive but my understanding of the true warrior nature is the fight is NOT the goal - achieving victory and then returning to peace and safety back home afterwards is. So I am learning to sit with that space.  .
Struggle: I was forced to resign from my job after only 10 weeks of working here. I have been looking for other employment to be honest because this place is not a good fit for me but I wanted to have something lined up before I resigned on my own terms. The physical pain I have with anxiety and depression are back and making me kinda miserable...Triumph: I stuck to my sobriety and my weightloss program last night despite the stress that would have usually had me bingeing on both food and alcohol. I have been telling people about my sobriety. I came clean with my partner (who does not live with me) about how much I have been drinking and how it had become a problem. We talked about his feelings about me quitting and I was able to support him so he can support me...General: I had an interview for a new job yesterday and I hope it will turn into a long term position.
**Struggle:** Wife is going thru chemo and is doing pretty well. Well enough to fight with me about this and that. I struggle with a sense that I should feel one way or another. Like its selfish to be OK. Fighting the anxiety vs. observing. Need to be more passive aggressive with it..**Triumph:** My oldest moved out. Doing OK. He is 1-1/2 years opiate free and now my house is pot and alcohol free. Ratcheted down tensions. Replaced my daughter's car she wrecked. And gosh darn I just look good!..**General:** Been cooking some awesome things. So yes never get out of the boat Chef even for those delicious mangos!! 
Iwndwyt the first 24...

Truimph: After hating AA for years for all the ways it let me down i got a sponsor yesterday after finding a person i felt would be a good fit. Im kind of excited to at least give AA and the steps an honest go...Struggle: My partner is talking to his ex now that hes out of jail. He is being open and honest about it though and i trust him 100% but there is still a part of me that feels insecure and jealous about it. Its like theres this nagging voice in my head that tells me hes going to leave me for the ex that i was a placeholder the whole time. I know this is bullshit and im trying to work through it but im still having a rough time. Strangely this was the final straw that made me willing enough to try and work the steps and get a sponsor after realizing im having a hard time controlling my negative emotions on my own while staying sober...
**Struggle:**  Exhaustion.  Work schedule and school and kids and dogs and chickens and life got me wonky tired...**Triumph:**  I'm gonna nap my way out of exhaustion.  Those sheets are calling my name...**General:**  I'm so glad that after my long 3 day work/school/commuting I'm really here at home for four days straight.  And I also come home to SD.  Good for my soul.  Grateful for all of you.../u/sfgirlmary what is the solution to that need to misbehave?  I have that too.  Not really terrible stuff but definitely have that feeling inside me.
**Triumph:** Coming out of a depressive spell (I hope). I've learned how to take care of myself and was able to limit the impact of this spell...**Struggle:** I'm struggling with my kid's behavior my expectations and how to react. Fun stuff especially because it depression leaves me very tired and angry. Not the best place to be starting from...**General:** Apocalypse Now is one of those movies I should really rewatch sober.
General: I ate some cheese I found in the fridge. About 10 minutes later my face was flushed and I felt a little buzzed. Found out the cheese is fondue cheese and has alcohol in it! It is weird how much a tiny bit of alcohol affected me. Two months ago it would have taken a glass of wine. I hope this doesn't mean I have to reset my badge? ..Struggle: I am going out Saturday night. It's a restaurant so hopefully it won't be too much of a challenge. I just hope nobody wants to go to a bar after. Then I will have to make my excuses and leave...Triumph: I think less and less about alcohol every day. 
Officially day 10 for me!  I never thought I'd see double digits after being such an asshat for 27 years. IWNDWYT!!!
What up IWNDWYT!
**Triumph:**  Over one and a half years since I've drunk alcohol.  ..**Struggle:**  For various reasons I started an elimination diet one week ago and I'm avoiding sugar wheat soy dairy and eggs and anything artificial.  I'm struggling with this my sugar addiction was ramping up and going cold turkey has left me crawling the walls.  I have noticed some improvement with pain and breathing at least.  It's harder than I thought it would be to do without my homemade bread...**General:**  Depression sucks.
It's easy to say while I'm eating lunch but I will not drink today. I will not go to a liquor store on my way home from work
Struggle: I let down my coworker that I'm really close with this morning when I slept through an obligation then lied about having car problems. I feel incredibly guilty because we almost always have each other's back and I totally disappointed him today. I'm attempting to apologize via cookies but realistically I need to stop letting people-including myself-down. Seems like my flakiness is something getting sober doesn't eliminate..Triumph: speeeeeaking of getting sober I'm at day 100 today and it feels so good. Last night I learned to play one of my favorite songs of all time on guitar had some deep conversations with a close friend and stuffed my face with white cheddar popcorn-SOBERLY. It was fantastic. ..General: my fourth step needs to get going and I need to be using my planner to effectively plan my time out-I've been avoiding both for two weeks and all it's gotten me is disheveled and disorganized. Ain't no party like a planner party. 
Struggle: To stay on my morning exercise routine and not be lazy and mope around the house..Triumph: Driving by the liquor store on my way to work and not wanting to stop.Tuning out my drinking voice..General: The bluebonnets are beautiful this year and always cheer me me up and make me smile.
**Struggle:** I've been feeling exceptionally tired today and also feeling a lot of pressure at work. I guess I drank to feel better about myself and I've realized that at my job I often feel less-than or not good enough. This has always been a big trigger for me...**Triumph:** I'm working on putting my physical and mental health before everything else lately (or making sure it's an equal priority!) I've been super dedicated to going to my favourite spin classes finally found a therapist who works during my free hours and am making a bunch of doctor appointments soon. These were all things I avoided while I was drinking...**General:** I'm planning a trip to New Orleans soon that's really got me excited! An old friend lives there and I'm desperate to see her. She's also trying to get sober. &lt;3..IWNDWYT!!!
struggle: trying to ease back into dating but i still miss him. and it makes me feel pathetic considering how bad it ended...triumph: i have been dealing with tough things at work and doing well...general: i feel my head is less noisy and the need to escape has diminished for now which is such a relief. still attempting to enjoy it.
Struggle: My ex and I were trying to get back together but over the weekend she totally lost it on me and I had to walk away. I almost walked right into a bar.  I was so triggered I called out of work the next day to wallow in my sadness and focus on rebuilding myself. ..Triumph: I went to my first AA meeting over the weekend and made some sober friends. I'm not totally sold on AA but it's nice to have new friends to check up on me. Also I'm hit my two month mark which is absolutely unbelievable. ..General: I'm killing it at my job (I'm a copywriter) and I'm starting to venture into new creative areas. I'm thinking about taking some writing classes at Second City. 
Went to my first day on the new job in a new stateand for about 30 minutes I was my old self again working hard and not thinking about my girlfriend (we broke up when I moved last Friday)  My bills are pretty nuts and I'm adjusting to life with my parents again but the sun is out and I made a good impression on my co-workers!  Not drinking with you tonight!
I totally get the "ooh I can get away with it" feeling!  But I know you're too smart to fall prey to that and plus I wanna see the new collage that I know you're working on instead of drinking!  Glad you're calling out a potential trigger and recommitting to sobriety...**Struggle:**  I cannot get someone hired for a position at work and it is demoralizing my employees and wasting my time.  It's making me nuts!  We just can't compete financially with larger organizations and it's a job searcher's market here.  Ugh...**Triumph:**  Got all of my spring seeds planted despite inertia and the desire to just sink into my couch every day after work.  Next step clean the damn house!..**General:**  I've been watching The Magicians and I absolutely want to style my wardrobe after the gay male character.  I love his vests!  Middle age can suck it!
I have not drank today and will not drink this evening :)
