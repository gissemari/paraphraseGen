Today is my 6th month sober anniversary!Tomorrow will be a little difficult for me as it will be the first time I'll be in a drinking environment. But my dad will be there he'll help me through it if I struggle. .I just wanted to tell all of you here how thankful I am for each and every one of you. I don't know how well I would've done if I hadn't found this sub..To those just starting out it does get easier. You gotta do it everyday that's the hard part. .Merry Christmas everyone! IWNDWYT!

That's great - congratulations on six months! Staying sober will be the best xmas gift you can give yourself tomorrow. I can't wait to wake up on Christmas day and see if Sober Claus visited  (he will have done) :-)
That's a lovely 6 months you have there!       outstanding!  
Congratulations on your six months.   Great milestone.
