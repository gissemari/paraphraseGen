I lost weight too over these 78 days and I'm a stick man as it is. :(
And even more impressive that can of shaving cream has lasted you over 3 months! :)..Kidding aside great job!!!!!!! You look awesome! #NoHomo

I've had weight loss too. For me copious amounts of alcohol followed by copious amounts of food to lessen my hangover the next morning for years had made me overweight. Now the weight is coming off it's such a nice plus to sobriety! 
I'm four months sober and while I haven't seen these kind of results it will be a near certainty soon. I am actually up with energy in the morning for the first time in 15 years so I just need to start the workout habit...Great job!
Rock on man! Sobriety has been awesome for my waistline too. Eating better and no alcohol calories just made the fat melt off.
