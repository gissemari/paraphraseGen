The closer I get to my 1 year soberity anniversary the more anxious I become. I've forgotten why I've stopped so I've lost my incentive to continue. Today is 293 and after 365 days I don't trust myself. I'm dreading it.

Do you have to know that you won't be drinking on day 366? All I have to know is that I'm not drinking today. :)
365 is just an arbitrary number. Nothing special about it at all. ..Focusing on today and today only helped me tremendously!
Same advice...don't worry about any day past the next 24 hours :)
Agreed. One day at a time. Even though it sounds like a cheesy over used coment. There is a reason it's there. Hang in there. I am coming up on a year close to the time you are. Yes I feel like a year is a special mark in time but at the end of the day it's just a number. 
Day 366 is just another day no reason for it to mean anything.  I'm coming up on a year myself and I thought I'd be more  on top of it' by now but I'm not and that's okay.  I've already done it hundreds of times so I know I can keep on with it...Take care you deserve the gift you've given yourself - keep giving it.
You guys are totally right. I went to bed feeling defeated overwhelmed and just overall depressed. The simple logic of one day at a time has really lifted my spirits. ..Thank you all for this reminder!!!
