A few nights ago (4 or so) I drank 2 pints of vodka and completely blacked out. The next day my head hurt in multiple ways and the back of my head felt very bruised. My boyfriend informed me that I hit my head super hard on my side table. I Definitely had a concussion. I should have gone to the hospital but he said I just fell asleep. I felt pretty upset at myself of course but also that he saw me hit my head and left me alone to drift unconscious. I am thankfully okay and we talked it out.  I think he is just numbed to my drunkenness and didn't realize how dangerous it was not only did I hare alcohol poisoning  but a concussion too. This was another relapse but it really scared me and is hopefully enough to keep me on track. I did a lot of embarrassing things on my 2-3 day bender that culminated in this as well. Fuck vodka. Fuck alcohol in general. Anyways I'm back on track with about 5 days sober. Missed 2 days of work recovering which I feel awful about too because I just started. Now that I'm feeling better small cravings have been coming up but I'm staying strong and researching new strategies to keep me straight. Happy to be alive right now. Iwndwyt
