I have been told to go to meetings and get a sponsor from the get go.  So I would go to a few meetings and get a 'temporary' sponsor and not entirely commit ... what could I be doing wrong why do I keep relapsing so hard and just can't get back up?  wow! ... oh my well I finally have after three years of fiddling around and "trying my best" with sobriety have found a good sponsor that is bringing me through the book and the steps for the first time.  my sponsor has made an incredible difference and it has only been a week.  Since my last drunk which lasted about 3 months I have felt like there is hope for me.  One week and back up but this time I'm doing whatever it takes.  Thanks guys this place helps so does actually reading that book I've been given like 9 times it may have taken a while but I couldn't be more grateful that it is now.

&gt; I have been told to go to meetings and get a sponsor from the get go. ..Not here you weren't. ..What is the purpose of this post?  You have 7 days sober and you think you're cured all because you have a sponsor?  Getting sober takes time and work. Let's not get ahead of ourselves.  Doing so can only end poorly as you  skip the work thinking you've got it in the bag. Your post reads like an advertising testimonial by someone who has never even used the product in question.  It's good to be excited but you've gotta keep your feet on the ground.  Yaknowwhaimsaying?
congratulations! It sounds like you are making changes to help you in your sobriety.
