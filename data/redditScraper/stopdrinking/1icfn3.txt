Hello everyone  [just posted my story in another sub](http://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/1icacj/quit_drinking_some_time_ago_decided_to_give_it/)...I had 9 months sober and clean then relapsed and I've been pretty hit-or-miss on sobriety for about 4 months.  Time to re-enter recovery...Sitting here going through withdrawal - headache stomachache the shakes.  I can't take anything for my head because it'll make me vomit.  I can't go for a walk or exercise and I can't drive anywhere because I'm shaking too badly.   I wish I could just knock myself out and not wake up until tomorrow..Such a sad concept that you can complete waste a day and all as an indirect effect of something that's supposed to be fun.  I've probably done this half a dozen times too.....The longer you go without drinking the easier it is to forget how miserable it can make you and to dissociate the problems it causes & invites...I had nine months sober though.  I can do it again and it starts today.
