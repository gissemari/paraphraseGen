My badge hasn't been updating. But that's okay. This weekend I was around my boyfriend and his friends while they were drinking and I didn't cave! ..In the last month:..* I got accepted into a trade school for next summer in California for 6 weeks! I am gonna try to get ahead on rent so I can go sooner. But we'll see!..* I've started eating better and have been meal prepping plant based/vegan meals for lunches..* I had my impacted wisdom tooth finally removed last week because I could afford the $500 out of pocket costs after insurance. ..* I haven't had a horrible anxiety attack since I drank last..* My dreams have been more vivid and weird but I feel way more well rested ..* My relationship is back on track and doing pretty good. ..* my bags under my eyes aren't as puffy and dark and my skin isn't as dry!..I was hoping for my depression to basically subside like many of you had happen but that hasn't been the case. It's still bad and I still can sleep 14 hours on accident. Or  not eat much on the weekend. Or struggle to do chores. Even though I can tell I'm doing better that's just something I've been dealing with nearly all of my life. But I haven't tried to kill myself since my last drink. So that's a plus haha...Now all I've got to do is get a gym membership. But I have to wait til i get paid because the only cheap gym in my area is planet fitness. Which would be fine but it's not because they want my routing # to sign up. ..Anyway I hope you have a good week and thanks for listening to me talk. IWNDWYT. .

Good for you!  That's a whole lot of positive.  I've only been two weeks and my depression hasn't subsided But I'm experiencing a whole lot more that is positive to counteract it.
