Alcoholism seems genetic as hair color. My brother is a few years older than I and he has struggled with alcohol in precisely the same way that I have and having someone who understands especially someone who has lived it longer than I have is invaluable. He has managed to for the most part abstain for quite a while and trust me when you're us that requires some fucking will power. I just feel like I've had relatives who have struggled with the same issues as me who have inspired me. Maybe this seems ridiculously specific but I wonder if any of you have had a relative who was as fucked up as you but overcame it and inspired you to change.
