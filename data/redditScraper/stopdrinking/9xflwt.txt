Someone from my support group died. Relapsed she took her own life. She was a nice caring sensitive person. Dealing with this addiction is hard. I have to take good care of myself keep reminding myself that life is fragile and it is worth living it sober. Thankfully I have no cravings just sadness and tears. Tears for her. I will remember her and IWNDWY Tonight.

I am **so sorry** to hear that! What a tragedy. May she rest in peace **&lt;3**..This is a valuable reminder of what a dangerous disease we are fighting...Sending you a virtual hug. IWNDWYT.....
That is so hard to deal with. So tragic. My heart is flying out of my chest in support. .IWNDWYT
Hugs. This shit is real. Someone was going to be writing that about me 28 days ago. I am so grateful to be here with you and send my love. Stay strong but feeling it   
I'm so sorry for your loss. ..It is moments like this when I really appreciate how fortunate I am to still be here. This lady Avicii and Mac Miller this year have shown that not everyone who struggles with addiction survives...May this lovely lady rest in peace.
Damn. Glad you are here. Thank you for sharing.
