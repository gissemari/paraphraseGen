My tolerance for some people is at an all time low. Being drunk was the only way i could put up with the company of some individuals.  I think it was because at some point in time my drinking had become so socially unacceptable even to the hardest drinkers in my social group that I sought out a lower caliber of company. Then there was the next day horror at how i had compromised my 'so called' moral standards! The irony!! Cognitive dissonance from hard boozing is a tough circle to square especially when on reflection I realise that I was the lower caliber of company for someone else.  The real mind bender is that...I miss it. still crave it. Wreckless abandon filling my blood and brain up with anything that will get me higher than the last thing i imbibed talking shit wasting money drink/substance enduced delusional states of coolness and being in control. Nuts..I say that but then I so want to be clean and sober. I have tried for years and years with limited success and when I do get some clean/sober time 30 days 90 days 6 months I feel so good about myself and optimistic about my future. I really hope I get it this time I haven't got the time to keep relapsing...Thanks SD for being here for me to spill out my thoughts and feelings.

This is something I hear all the time at AA meetings among some newly sober.  What I also hear is that with sustained time sober and sometimes counseling the irritation and intolerance gets better.  Sometimes we find that the reason we are irritated and intolerant with others is that we unconsciously identify on some level with those that provoke us.  There's a saying in recovery: you spot it you got it.
When I was a drinker everyone else was annoying. Just the other day I looked around and thought wait a minute -- everyone suddenly seems so nice! Was my *bad attitude* the problem all along?
