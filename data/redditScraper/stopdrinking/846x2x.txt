So the weight loss is happening although not as fast as I'd like - what a surprise... (Background info: in addition to my current sober streak I did 24 days in Jan-Feb and I've had about 20 other sober days this year.) I've already lost some weight around the waist and the thighs which is great. I haven't weighed myself (I never do because I have a history of eating disorders in my early twenties) but I **see** the change in the mirror and and notice it from the way certain clothes fit me more loosely. BUT: I have a problem zone: back fat or more precisely the so called **bra bulge**. You know the rolls of fat on your back above and below your bra... ugh! I'm not overweight so my bra bulge isn't nearly as bad as it could be... but it's there. And I'm and so frustrated by it! (Especially as I love wearing quite tight-fitting tops.) I've been gaining and losing weight in turns - depending on how bad my drinking has been - during the last four years or so but I never used to have **this** problem. I think I first started noticing the bra bulge last summer or fall. Now I don't know if the culprit is alcohol (and its effect on hormones and therefore on body fat distribution) or my age (early 40s) or both - but I **do** know I WANT TO GET RID OF THIS!..So I'd like to ask: did you / do you have a particular problem zone (from where it was/is especially difficult to shed fat) after you stopped drinking? Has anyone else been struggling with bra fat? And: ANY TIPS ??

The irony is that I **have** lost fat from my **boobs**. Where's the justice in this world?! :D
I'm right there with ya! I'm hoping that my bra bulge will lessen after loosing more weight. A while back I remember watching an infomercial for something called a genie bra. I might have to look into one... who knows if they really work though. It would be nice to wear certain tops without feeling self conscious. 
Guy here but I hold weight in my face that drives me bonkers. It's the first place I gain and the last place I lose at least it seems like that to me. That and my gut are my problem areas...Nothing for it but to keep eating right (which is greatly helped by sobriety in my experience) and hope it comes off unfortunately :(
 I also have a problem with an active eating disorder and right now due to binge drinking I am skinny fat. It pisses me off. But just after 4 days with no booze I too can already see and feel a difference around my stomach and thighs. God getting older can be a pain. 
Sweet Mother of Pear Jam...I have some bra bulge on back *and* I swear to God a chicken cutlet under each of my arm pits. I'm 55 and postmenopausal but have been this way for at least 15 years. I was told once that having kiddos and breastfeeding uses these areas (as well as upper arms) to store water for producing milk in case wooly mamouths cornered us into a cave. Too bad nature doesn't know that LaCroix water is plentiful at grocery store lol...Also read that an improperly fitted bra can animate all of these areas. Thicker bras can make a world of difference in smoothing things out. Gone are the cutesy little bras for me. As for how to get rid of it? Not sure what exercises might help...will have to google it when I get a chance. ..I will not drink with y'all today.  within  
My wife and I are both working on losing some weight. All I can say is that the body is really a funny beast. I feel like I've lost all my weight in my legs (which I never thought were bad) and not in my gut. So my legs went from looking somewhat muscular to looking like chicken legs and my gut is still hanging on pretty strong (I know I've lost some weight there- but its def happening a lot slower)..My wife has had a similar experience. I can tell shes lost weight in her face and legs but shes disappointed with how much she's still carrying around her midsection..My best tip is to just stick with it. It sucks to not get results when we feel like we are working so hard but they will come. Just have to stick with it and it will happen.
You can't spot reduce fat. End of story. Your body's fat cells don't work like muscle cells. 
I'm mid 40s and I'm experiencing the same thing.  I have been working out with weights and it helping. Our bodies composition changes as we get older. 
I know you cant target fat areas but perhaps a fitness routine and decent lifting routine for back could help transform it. Lotsa "skinny fat" people prove a little muscle can tramsform a body. ..My weight all goes to my face and gut; the two worst areas imo. My friend's all goes to his arm and butt which are pretty nice genetic-lottery =)
I would try on a bunch of different bras so that while working on the weight I can look good in my clothes. My issue although I'm on the skinny side were some unyielding muffin/love handles going on. The right undies make all the difference! I look for stuff with nice wide lacy bands as opposed to thin tight elastic strings...Patience... early days yet! I didn't trouble myself with the weight too much until after a couple of months of getting sober. The less pressure I put on myself the fewer reasons to drink :)
SPORTS BRA!!!!!!! .36DD here tucks everything in and I don't wobble when I walk so much..I have some pretty underwear tucked away for the candlelit moments
