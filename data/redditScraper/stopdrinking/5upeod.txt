(1) how do you know when you're having fun? and (2) what is preventing you from having fun?
What kind of parties are you going to? I protected myself by avoiding anyone who abused alcohol. I changed my thinking about what was "fun" also. Going to AA gave me new friends who had a sober lifestyle. 
If you need to drink alcohol while doing an activity it's probably just a crummy activity. Anything that I have ever enjoyed doing I have enjoyed doing sober. If the party is a bummer without the alcohol it's not the lack of alcohol that's a problem it's the party. No need to out yourself in undesireable positions.
