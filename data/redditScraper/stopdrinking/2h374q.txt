I never thought I would ever make it this far! Thanks to this great sub and all the wonderful advice and support I've received from everyone here I am 3 weeks sober today!!...I feel great and I have learned a lot over the last 21 days. I can't believe I didnt stop sooner in my life but Im so glad that I am sober now. I don't think I would have been able to stay sober if it wasnt for this sub. In the first 10 days of my sobriety I was here nearly every waking minute either reading posts from other redditors posting my own struggles asking advice or commenting on other users posts. Everytime I feel an urge I come here and read or write something. ..When I reach my 30 day mark I will write a Saturday share. Thanks again everyone!
