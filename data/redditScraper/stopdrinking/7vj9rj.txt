And that makes today a holiday. Two of my worst relapses have begun on Super Bowl Sunday. The first was in 2015 when I was trying to play the Moderation Game. I had been drinking only on non-worknights for about three months and told myself "just this once" on Super Bowl Sunday. We got about 8" of snow that day and work was cancelled for the next day a couple hours before kickoff. I drank hard enough to 1) pass out early and not see the play that Marshawn Lynch should have gotten the ball on and 2) wake up the next day still drunk. That wasn't an issue since I had plenty of booze left and I kept on drinking. A couple weeks later my 2 nights/wk turned in to 4 turned in to 5 and turned in to being disappointed when I wouldn't get the opportunity to have a beer...The second was last year. I was upset over a potential relationship not working out and decided to have a bunch of beer during the game. Again it set me on a path to regular drinking that I was just able to slow and stop in the last couple of months.  ..BUT that didn't happen this weekend last night or today. I watched the game in its entirety found out after going to bed that we wouldn't have school today and though I ended up getting back up I just had some water poked around on SB Nation's YouTube for a while and went to bed. Today I got to the gym this morning ran some errands for relatives and was able to get in an important phone call that I've been missing out on making since making calls during Business Hours can be difficult when at work. ..21 days and rolling!
