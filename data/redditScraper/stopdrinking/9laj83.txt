I left my job in a pretty abrupt and embarrassing manner when I relapsed last month. It was a sneaky gift that breakdown. ..I took the money I saved and I've been travelling all around the country staying with friends and family while I work on web projects I never had time for finally finishing my inventory (AA) and applying for jobs on the road...I just got news I have two interviews for two SICK companies. Sobriety is leading me to a place where my dreams come true. Other than my hemorrhaging bank account my life feels perfect right now. I'm comfortable being alone now I have community and I'm hitting my goals left and right...The hard times are temporary it all passes eventually. It's true when you look for the good things in life you'll find them. I feel that way as I read through the posts here. I'm so happy for you and me!
