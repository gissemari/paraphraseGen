*I'm breaking Sharing My Journey in to multiple parts. Part 1 is about the beginning of my struggles with alcohol while being negligent to the problem*..First a huge thank you to everyone involved in this sub for making it what it is. I've been lurking for about a week and have found the abundance of stories support etc. to be incredibly therapeutic. ..Second a few statistics about me before I get started with my story. I am not giving them because I've mistaken this sub for an alternate to eHarmony but because I believe that each has been an instrumental factor in my journey to sobriety. I am a 33-year-old male who is currently single employed as an educator and is a homeowner. ..The journey to where I am right now began in my opinion almost three years ago to the day. It was the day after a friend's wedding (10/26/14) and I was returning the tux I had rented to serve as his groomsman. It was the first time I'd ever really broken a promise to myself. Flashing back about four months to the date I got measured I almost chuckled at the waist size (36). I was a life-long 32 or 33 to the point that anything bigger than those made me look like I was trying out for an MC Hammer video. When I was measured as a 36 I figured it was part-mistake and part wake-up call for me that I needed to get back in to shape. That year I had definitely fallen into some poor dietary habits. It was my second full year of teaching and first with a master's so I had some real money coming in. Gone were the days of tuna and cafeteria salad for lunch and in were the days of Friday happy hours and Thursday night burgers after JV football games.  It wasn't a bad life that's for sure but I was out of shape and didn't like it. Back to the broken promise - when I got that measurement I had told myself that I would not be a 36 at the wedding. My hope actually was to be around a 34. I'd never really had much muscle mass so I was hoping that in those four months I could have a combo of diet and exercise that would bring my waistline down but add a little muscle to my body. Well that summer I picked up golf. I did get my exercise but the best my body could do was keep its nose above water at its new level of fitness rather than work to any improvement...You may notice that I haven't yet mentioned alcohol and this is by design. See at this point in my thought process alcohol and particularly having any sort of alcohol problem wasn't on my radar. I'd done (what I thought) were some diagnostics and thought "no way." I didn't even drink at all until I was 22. I'd never been behind the wheel when I shouldn't be - I either got a ride or stayed where I was. I had drank more frequently over the past 18 months (realistically it was like 450 out of 500 days) but had never drank to excess. It was usually a beer with dinner and 1 or 2 more to finish off the night. I'd never gone to work hungover or even woke up with a fog that the shower couldn't clear on a weekday. Weekend hangovers were gone by the time I had a cup or 2 of coffee. ..Either way I had a problem. In my mind it was a weight/fitness problem and I realized that the best solution was to do some AM workouts. The first week was a success. I was ridiculously tired sure but I got up each day and hammered out a workout. I felt great. That Sunday I golfed. My standard amount of beers for a round is 6. 3 on the front 2 on the back and 1 long one in the clubhouse while we eat and have a burger followed by some waters or coffees before heading home. We teed off in the morning that day (probably around 9 AM) so I was done with my final beer around 2. I came home relaxed had dinner and went to bed around 9 as I had been all that week. When I woke up the next day I felt awful. I didn't go to the gym. I couldn't. I still (in my mind at the time) didn't have a drinking problem but I did realize something: there was no way that I could work out at 5 AM after drinking the day before so I cut out weekday beers. ..From the first week in November '14 through Super Bowl Sunday of '15 I did well. I went from 206 lb to 182 felt my waistline drop while also feeling shirts get more snug in the shoulders and chest. So what happened? It wasn't the Super Bowl it was the snow. It snowed about 9" here in the Midwest that day and school was cancelled for the next day about three hours before kickoff. As soon as we got the call I started celebrating (drinking). It snowed well in to the night and the next day it looked like we would be off on Tuesday. Everyone around us was. I drank again that night. Fast forward 2 weeks and we had our mid-winter break: another opportunity to drink a few nights in a row. That ended up being followed by more untimely weather and the next thing you knew we had about 8 weekdays without school in February. Without even knowing it the tide had turned. The idea of getting up that early every day became more of an irritant than a point of pride. 5 4-5 days per workweek turned into a begrudging 2. A few weeks later baseball (I coach) started and the gym became history. Once games began I was back to post-game burgers and beers and when school got out in June of '15 I was also back to 205 lb.
