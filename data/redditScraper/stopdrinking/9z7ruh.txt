I dont know where else to ask this.....&amp;#x200B;..I relapsed last night and crashed my car. Cops came. Car was towed and the cops put me in a cab and sent me home. car should be getting delivered to a body shop now. But I dont know if the cops are pursuing the DUI side of things or what...  Can someone tell me if this will happen in the coming days? I am rattled and confused

If they sent you in a cab home it sounds pretty good...Did you take a breathylzer? I knew a girl with a broken wrist from getting into a car accident but they still had her spend the night in the drunk tank. She had to get her own help the next day...If they didn't do anything like that HOLY SHIT are you lucky you didn't get what you deserve. Take this luck and don't make the same mistake again amigo. 
I would definitely this as a get out of jail free card. You left in a cab not a cop car. For whatever reason. I am hoping that you can get to reading more here and get into stop drinking mode make a plan and use this as an amazing gift to get you around the corner to a beautiful life. Be well! i w n d w y t.
Oh wow - A very similar thing happened to me. (Except the cops let me drive home which I still can't believe.) They didn't field test me or have me do a breathalyzer. I was afraid that they were going to come after me at a later date but nothing ever happened...That was a bit over 6 years ago. Best of luck to you and I'll join you in not drinking today!
I suggest you look up the local Alcoholics Anonymous meetings...If you get processed then the court will probably mandate you to treatment so going to AA means you're getting a jump on it and your lawyer will thank you...If you don't get arrested than you will meet some sober folks near you who can help you stay clean...That's my suggestion
