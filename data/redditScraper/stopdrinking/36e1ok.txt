You can turn it around!! Don't drink and your problems will start to become manageable and the path to salvation will become clearer. Drugs and alcohol cloud your judgment. Keep coming back here and we will try our best to help you!  
You CAN turn this around never give up hope! Keep trying each day is an opportunity to stay sober. 
You can. You can!
