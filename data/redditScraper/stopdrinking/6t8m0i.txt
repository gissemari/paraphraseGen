This is more about what's underneath drinking and what led to drinking than a problem with drink anymore. Really struggling to be any kind of productive or positive today could do with some support. I won't drink with you today.

The way I think this issue in my life is .... "one ridiculous problem at a time please". For now I'm trying to stop drinking. Depression or 100 other issues will be dealt later.
It is completely normal to have down time. Last weekend I hardly did anything for 3 full days. I felt guilty about it but I reminded myself I was feeling depressed and to just accept that I can do nothing if I require that. I feel better this week and have been much more productive at work and at home. Just take it easy on yourself. I struggle with depression too and for me beating myself up about it just makes it much worse. 
All the untreated depression and anxiety I've had since my teen years is starting to resurface as I peel away the layers of alcohol abuse that have been hiding my feelings. As physical wounds take time to heal so do emotional struggles. One day at a time doing your best (even if that just means surviving- the most basic component of living) is your success your strength. Don't give up you are not your depression you are your strengths and we are all here to support you as your stregnth(s) grow in to their (aka your) potential!
