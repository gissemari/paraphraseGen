Feeling strong I've already lost 10 pounds and the clarity I am gaining is amazing.  I know a separation/divorce is imminent but I am trying to be strategic about it.  I have been relapsing every week or two for 2 years due to the awful awful relationship I am in. Let me rephrase - it's my own decisions and responsibility however the God-awful relationship I am in is not helping.  We have a little girl together and she constantly buys alcohol to try to tempt me so that she can continue to threaten me and say "I'll testify that you are unfit if you try to divorce me."..I'm not going to be manipulated any more.  I am making a plan and I'm getting out with my daughter.  And most importantly I am choosing not to drink today. I will do this.
