I was trying to yank myself out of the swirl of self hate for relapsing by looking at famous people that are now sober. To kind of show myself "look they got sober and did good things it's  not too late". I always forget King drank and snorted his way through writing Cujo to the extent he doesn't recall writing it. ..Then I came across an article talking about how relatable Doctor Sleep is to alcoholics. ..Guys. I'm 25% into this book and it's like reading posts here. I've nearly cried twice because those are my feelings AND thoughts. Exactly. ..The best part is now I think I can go to AA. I was scared before but it seems like something I desperately need now. The way King writes about the main character going to AA made it click for me. ..Maybe fiction works better for some reading this has affected me more than The Naked Mind. I just really wanted to share with you all. IWNDWYT.

Yes...I love Stephen King and Doctor Sleep was very powerful about alcoholism.  The part where he buys the Thunderbird...twists open the cap twists it back closed over and over...I've been there.
It's about the boy in the shining. 
Do I need to read The Shining to understand this book?
I need to reread now that I'm sober. I love Stephen king.
This is the book I was reading when I decided to get sober! It is so relatable and made me realise how low I was. Amazing book.
I'm grateful for the program and fellowship of AA for my sobriety.  It's low cost and all volunteer. ..If you are interested in learning more about AA the official website is AA.org.  Here's an introductory pamphlet... https://www.aa.org/assets/en_US/p-1_thisisaa1.pdf

Can't believe I've never heard of this. I just downloaded it can't wait to read thanks!
Omg you're not kidding. I just downloaded Doctor Sleep and can't stop reading it! This sentence really struck me "Dan eyed it with morbid fascination (not for the first time) that the hungover eye had a weird ability to find the ugliest things in any given landscape." Wow that brought back memories of how dark and negative my thoughts could be in the throes of a hangover. So grateful to be sober. 
Love it. I prefer it to The Shining and its one of my favourite SK books it doesn't seem to get much love over on the SK sub though.
