[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy Hump Day! What's Up Wednesdays are when we celebrate our sobriety see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** For years I avoided the Financial District in San Francisco because that's where I was working (in a high-paying prestigious job) when I got fired for keeping booze in my desk.  I was afraid that if I went back I'd feel nostalgia. But the other day I inadvertently ended up at the bus stop across the street from my old building outside the Irish bar where I went straight after I got fired. Back then after being made to leave the office after a humiliating meeting with the boss I'd gone over to the bar and had three vodka martinis but my tolerance was so high I didn't even feel them. Remembering this I thought no nostalgia from SFGirl. In fact I realized that I wouldn't go back to that life for a million dollars...**Struggle:** I was in a coffee shop a few days ago and I saw the vice-president from my old company whom I'd liked very much but I was too timid to go say hello to her. Whether drinking or sober I still struggle with shyness...**General:** I have been traveling a lot lately and I have started doing something just for fun. I will leave something in my apartment as a little gift for myself when I arrive back from my trip such as a bottle of my favorite sparkling water in the fridge or a jar of nice skin cream on my night-side table...Recently I read "Do something today that your future self will thank you for" and I thought of this new habit. But then I also thought of my sobriety as a whole. I know that as Today Mary I am glad that I didn't drink yesterday and I know that Tomorrow Mary will thank me for not drinking today...
----------immediate responses--------

I love this! I also do this with my yesterday self. I used to always be so mad at my yesterday self for setting my tomorrow self up with a bad day from too much drinking.. now I thank my yesterday self for doing great things for my tomorrow self. We get along so much better now! 
I like that and I'm stealing it as my new motto. I've always ignored any and all problems and declared them future me's problem fuck that bitch. Well I am that bitch and I'm sick of it...Triumph: Ended a casual relationship that I had more than casual feelings for. I'm sad and miss him but it was fucking me up mentally. I've never ended any kind of relationship before let alone with someone I had srs feelings for because deep down I'm worried I'll die alone. But if I'm being honest with myself I'd rather be alone than be in a relationship that makes me hurt...Struggle: Tonight is my friday. Before I quit drinking it would be binge city after work. Last week I faired well and stuck to candy and video games. This week my kid is staying over at a friends after school. I've found myself thinking about drinking just because I'll be alone. Like wtf brain? You know how that plays out. So I downloaded that book everyone on here swears by and will be reading it in my down time at work and def doing the daily check in to hold myself accountable...General: I went and saw It last weekend at the drive in with a friend I don't see a lot. Had a fabulous time and I can't wait for the second one!
Triumph: everytime I want a drink I drink herbal tea and it helps. .Struggle: friends want to go out and I know they will drink and I don't think I can say no. 
Such a great thought that we're already giving our future selves a leg up by fighting the good fight today.  .My triumph:  I've had a terrible few days but I didn't drink today and god I wanted to.  I also just wanted to get real stoned and make everything disappear but I also didn't do that.  I hurt and cried and let myself feel terrible but didn't reach for anything other than LaCroix and a huge bowl of pho.  .Struggle:  My family is going through serious tough times since my BIL got arrested yesterday.  I just wanna be there for them and I live across the country.  I hate feeling so helpless.  .General:  I've had a few relapses and I just think that I'm getting stronger every time. I'm not proud of it but I'm learning about just how much of a hold booze has over me.  I just cannot drink and for some reason this has been the hardest truth to accept.  Here's to happiness and having the courage and love to go out and grab it.  Love my fellow sobernauts.  Today I will not drink with you.
You're awesome Mary. I'm wishing you an infinite supply of good things in your life.
Triumph: holding a course at work currently and it actually feels quite alright although exhausting. Before I would drown the exhaust and the feeling of notgoodenoughatmywork in alcohol but not this time.
Triumph: I didn't drink this last weekend...Struggle: Inconvenience (due to the liver I bet) and still some light withdrawal effects...General: I am not in my home country and my parents arrive tomorrow so that's great :)
Triumph: I didn't drink yesterday because the whole family went to a children's song group. The two young ones love it. Nice...Struggle: I have been on sick leave (unrelated) for ten months now and I am slowly getting back to normal. Too slow though in two months my income will drop significantly and I worry too much. It's not helping...General: Autumn is awesome! I just love this time of the year :-)
Congrats on *no nostalgia for SFGirl!* I feel the same way about my old position in the New York Financial District (and Irish pubs!)...**Triumph:**  I spent some quality time with Mom - it wasn't at the hospital doctors appointments or health care related stuff for a change; it was simply to go shopping for decorations for her favorite holiday: Halloween. Regardless of how miserable and mean my sister wants to be I'm going to make *DAMN* sure that my Mom and I are happy :). The 'Today Lisa' is not going to sit back and take that shit anymore...**Struggle:**   Driving between upstate and downstate every other day but there's nothing I can do to change it right now. &lt;Cue Serenity). ..**General:**  During my ridiculous commute I carry fun stuff with me (similar to what you do dear u/sfgirlmary): I carry Reese's Peanut Butter Cups blow pops (still love my gum) Bai Coconut Water and my favorite tunes. May as well enjoy the ride lol! 
Thanks for posting /u/sfgirlmary...Triumph: I joined a new (concert) band this past week! I was able to make contact and walk into the building and meet new people without having any connections before! (I saw a flyer for them.) This is HUGE for me as before I would have been super terrified gotten mad at myself for being super terrified and then gotten drunk and made everything worse...Struggle: My director at work called a last minute meeting for this morning. I'm nervous. People are whispering about possible layoffs but I guess I'll see what it's about...General: One of the meditation tapes I listened to mentioned imagining your problems as clouds drifting across the sky- you don't try to control them you just watch from a distance until they drift away. I've been doing that a lot lately and it's been helpful.
Triumph:  I got a promotion at work!  Though I've struggled to keep sober for more than a week a time I'm still miles ahead of daily-drinker-me and my bosses seem to notice.  I'm trying to think of this as a sample of what's possible with permanent sobriety.  ..Struggle: I've been stuck in the cycle of staying sober for 4-6 days then binge drinking for a day or maybe the whole weekend.  It's like I can only take being in my own head for so long before I have to use the escape hatch. ..General:  Things are mostly good.  I submitted a few articles to a horror movie website but they didn't bite.  That news came about the same time as my promotion so it didn't sting too bad.  I'm excited for October to start because as I mentioned horror movies are my shit. 
I will not drink today.
" ...do something today that your future self will thank you for....   "  Great idea. Thx.  What have I done for the really distant/ old  future me . Sobriety goes to top a list includes ..  savings  healthy sensible nutrition fitness and  athletic ....but none come close to the long term benefits of sobriety . And each  improves with each passing sober day. Hmmmm .Athough I often think in terms of one-day-at-a-time   the cumulative long term benefits / gifts are really nice to think about.  That said ... I think I'll plant a time capsule of interesting stuff somewhere . ...hmmmm.?  Have a great day. 
Happy Sober Wednesday to all 
Triumph: first day of hopefully many sober days to come yesterday. ..Struggle: going back to work today... I don't want to justify drinking at the end of the day by saying "I had a long day I deserve a drink."..I will not drink today.
Triumph: After a health scare I went to the doctor and got a clean bill of health. I have more energy now than I have had in months...Struggle: Boredom. I know. Nothing is boring there are only boring people. It's getting better though. I'm getting more interested in doing stuff. Any PC gamers who need a coop game buddy let me know I lost all my online friends when I drank heavily a few years ago.
**Triumph**:  I sold a motorcycle on Monday that was going to become one hell of a money pit when I did decide to put enough parts on it to make it street legal again.  With some of the money I got from that sale I got a mobile toolchest to tidy up my living room/workshop.  I finally found a buyer for my Harley that I don't ride anymore.  It costed me a chunk of change to get out from under the financing on it but I'm glad to see it gone.  I'll probably go right back into financing a brand new Yamaha but it'll be significantly cheaper than the Harley was.  .**Struggle**:  Some of the guys I work with like to act like they're "grown ass men" but still want you to hold their hand and show them how to do their own job.  Many of them have been working here 3x as long as me but still fall back on that "I didn't know" BS.  Next May I'll have been working here for 15 years.  It has taken a fair amount of restraint not to tell them exactly how I feel about it all we'll just have to see what happens.  .**General**:  I'm really looking forward to taking some trips on my new motorcycle.  I plan on hitting some twisties in the mountains of NM or central TX.  I enjoy riding more than most things in this world and am excited about doing it on something I enjoy riding again.  Dad has been pestering me about burning some vacay so we can travel but selling my other bikes has taken priority over everything until earlier this week.
**Triumph:** Getting a lot of good work done despite some head fog from coming off some medicine I was one for my cold. But that's passing and I'm starting to feel human again! Super frustrating to give up drinking in the hopes that I'd start to feel more connected with reality myself and my intellect only to get sick and feel super detached again for like a fricken month! ..**Struggle:** I still keep torturing myself with visions of the future playing "what if" games involving my career and alcohol. My twisted logic: the academic job market is incredibly bad so I'd be incredibly luck to even get an interview; people in academia love to drink a lot; what if I get an invitation for a campus interview and I turn down drinks at dinner and suddenly that other candidate who does drink looks more collegial? I've blown my one shot. Of course this line of thinking is insane for a number of reasons but I still can't keep myself from worrying about this stuff! ..**General:** No matter what challenges I face in the future *right now* I don't drink and I'm so happy I've gotten myself here. I feel way more even-keeled than when I drank. Just this kind of base-line contentment.
Oof. I feel ya mary. My hospital let me stay on after I was caught drunk on the job but I had to find a new unit. I was gone for about five months? I came back and kept running into people from my old unit. I had no idea what people knew or thought about my sudden departure esp folks on the opposite shift. And running into the coworkers I worked with acted to rip off whatever bandaid of self-healing I had created. All the embarrassment and self-loathing would just come seeping out...I finally ran into the nurse that had reported me that night. I was in a place at that time where I could thank her for stopping my death spiral and helping to give me a new better life. There are still days where I would not have the headspace to approach her but I am so grateful I was able to do it when I could.
Triumph: By making a couple changes to my daily routine I've been hitting my step goal most days of the past week. It's nice and I feel motivated to step up my walking even more :)..Struggle: I've started reading a new series that I really like which is good. But I can get obsessed with things and find myself staying up later and later to read more which is not ideal come morning. Of course being tired from reading too late is way better than being hungover but I do need to set myself limits still...General: I love the idea of leaving yourself little gifts. I'm going to do this next time I travel just something small to look forward to when I get home. Thanks for the great idea SFG!
**Triumph:** I'm down 5 lbs in the past month! Not drinking is doing well by my body and I think like it. I also start a new side job next week working with kids! Hooray!..**Struggle:** I've been doing some self-loathing lately. You know the thoughts: ['Stupid Piece of Shit'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGalix-sVXs) or 'Dumbass I can't believe you did that' or 'You know they're laughing at you'. Maybe it comes from loneliness maybe it's just a result of not taking antidepressants for a while. I'll have to think about it with a sober mind and figure it out. ..**General:** I'm purging my closet this weekend. I already started with some obvious stuff but on Saturday I'll work on setting up for [Project 333](https://bemorewithless.com/project-333/): only wearing 33 items of clothes for 3 months excluding underwear socks and workout clothes. It'll be good to scale back my lifestyle and get organized a bit. 
T: New work project is going well...S: Former career stuff still haunting me greatly. Messy and embarassing and there are still things I have to wrap up. I have to come to terms with many bad mistakes that I made and a great deal of neglect. And a lot of people pissed off at me. It is a lot of heavy stuff to carry. ..G: I am reading a book that sort of glamorizes alcohol and heavy drinking. I didn't realize that when I picked it up. But I'm not putting it down. I can read these parts of the book think about them honestly be honest with myself that yes some of this still sounds good. Then remind myself how far I've come what drinking REALLY was like for me at the end and there are absolutely no regrets about missing rather a deep desire that I never go back there again. 
**T:**  Survived my hometown festival with out drinking.  It didn't really even cross my mind...**S:**  Puke.  Daughter has been sick so lots of puking.  Lots of laundry.  She's feeling better today.  I sent her to school so hopefully no phone calls from the office...**G:**  When I travel I like to clean my house before I leave so that I come home to a nice and tidy home.  But when I travel I usually just throw some stuff in a bag and get the hell out of my house asap.  A few weeks ago when I went out of town I cleaned before I left and I didn't have that nagging dreadful feeling when I was coming home.
I love the idea of leaving little gifts for yourself!  I try to clean up my house before I leave for a trip with fresh sheets on the bed so I can just relax guilt-free when I return home.  Maybe I'll have a little something waiting next time!..**Triumph:**  Finally got to go to a Refuge Recovery meeting!!  And it's just what I hoped it would be.  Focus is on self-improvement mindfulness and healthy coping mechanisms - the same things I would be working on by myself in a much less interactive way.  I'm psyched I get to practice mindfulness in a recovery setting!  Thank you /u/embryonic_journey for putting me in touch with the new group!..**Struggle:**  I feel like I need to be making bigger progress in making some healthy changes to my life.  Trying not to be hard on myself and trust that these little changes will add up...**General:**  Going to go car camping this weekend and I think it's gonna be a mite chilly here in Colorado!  But looking forward to seeing some fall colors.  Anyone else getting out to check out fall colors?
Thank you for sharing. ..Triumph: I did not drink yesterday although a glass was offered me at dinner. ..Struggle: Dealing with feelings of guilt of starting over again and again and again. Realizing that I need a support group a better plan and to more effectively distance myself from my current friend group. ..General: Honestly feeling generally depressed and low. I'm on day two again. I think I upset my roommates with my last blackout. I've been hiding at a friend's apartment and trying to let myself feel calm and centered. I just wish I wasn't such a fuck up.

**Triumph:** I'm loving the fall weather--crisp mornings hot days and cool evenings. It's the kind of weather that makes me happy...**Struggle:** That fall weather also means it's crunch time at work. I'm struggling to stay on top of all my tasks. Why do I allow procrastination to creep in and make small issues so big?..**Future self:** I'm actually working on my Now-Self. It's easy for me to get wrapped up in Future-Self and neglect what's in front of my face.
Triumph: In spite of a horrible depressive episode yesterday I made myself go to the gym and actually enjoyed the workout and felt a lot better afterwards. ..Struggle: This new gym routine is making me so hungry that I want to eat ALL THE THINGS. I have to restrain myself from buying bags of chips or candy or grabbing a burger or.... It's not fun and there's only so much broccoli a girl can eat to replace the cravings. ..General: I'm almost finished with this enormous blanket I've been knitting which is good because some yummy new yarn is arriving today and I have another project lined up for it. 
*Triumph:* School's going well I'm really enjoying the new environment and challenge. So far so good I'm keeping on top of my work and engaging with my studies far more than I could have imagined last time. Big thanks to sobriety there...*Struggle:* Today was my first drug policy lecture and the lecturer was so drug positive. I'm personally in favour of reform and harm-reduction approaches but I really felt she was minimising the negative aspects of a lot of dangerous substances...It was a bit of a (narco)trigger I left the lecture desperate for a spliff or something. Drugs haven't been a big part of my life for a long time and I wouldn't know where to get any if I wanted some. Still it really annoyed me. Loads more of these sessions to go :-(..*General:* Counting the days till my partner and dog join me out here. Something I'm really looking forward to!
Triumph: Today is day 7 and I finally feel okay. No more brain fog and am not missing a drink for the first time in a very very long time..Struggle: Have plans with a friend tonight who is going through a very rough time with her husband. A group is going out for chicken wings to help take her mind off. .I will not drink with you all today! 
Triumph: I think it's my 17th day of not drinking and I'm sleeping better and not feeling depressed or anxious...Struggle: Hearing everyone (coworkers friends etc.) talk about drinking. ..General: This is the second time I've taken a break from drinking (63 days earlier this year) and I'm treating this one as an indefinite hiatus.
This probably isn't the right place. I checked in today but I messed up. I've had a drink. How do I get my batch reset?
Great insights! It's huge being able to go back to a place that holds a lot of memories and represents a time that was a big struggle for us. I love the idea of giving your future self something to be thankful for. 
T: Just got back from a week long backpack trip in the Sierras.  6 months ago when I had originally planned the trip I booked car camping sites near the entry and exit trailheads with the intent of having a place I could drink the night before entering the wilderness and also immediately upon exiting.  This has always been my normal practice but this time I cancelled those reservations and instead drove into town and got a nice dinner..S: Work is slow and I'm having a difficult time staying awake after lunch.  .G: I've been stocking the fridge ahead of time with all kinds of fizzy drinks so when I get home from work they are already there and I don't have to go shopping for them at the time of day when I would normally have been buying booze.
Triumph: I made it through 2 weeks and it was not as hard as I imagined. I've gone longer than that without drinking before but it wasn't an active decision on my part. This time I'm putting conscious effort into not drinking and improving my overall mental health and I'm kind of loving the way I feel right now. ..Struggle: I haven't decided how I'm going to tell all of my friends that I've decided to quit drinking. I want them all to know so that hopefully they understand why I'm avoiding going to shows at bars or other situations where I'm used to drinking but I am also a really private person and I hate letting everyone know that I've been having such a rough time in the last year. Even though I know most of them are aware it feels like failure to admit it. Part of me is also afraid that I'll fail and then everyone will know that I tried and couldn't do it. ..General: I started my first bullet journal to help me track my emotional health and to keep a record of all the things I accomplish when I'm not drinking. I also intend to use it to make a gratitude list every day so I can look back when needed for encouragement. My partner is also helping me with accountability; we've been attending recovery meetings based on meditation and I'm finding it a lot less nerve-wracking than AA meetings. ..Thank you all for being here! ..
Triumph: Got a job interview on Friday making progress toward a different career path...Struggle: My apartment complex is on its fifth manager since I moved in and apparently they lost my maintenance request for my late night smoke detector false alarms. (Already cleaned it and checked the battery but the manufacturer site said low battery it'll just beep instead of shouting FIRE FIRE FIRE)..General: I've read two books in the past five days and I'm nearly done with a third. Finished the NOFX bio and The Gunslinger and working on The Drawing of the Three (If I finish the Dark Tower series that'll put me at an even 20 King novels read)
It's been four days! I'm so proud of myself. 
I want to stop drinking and you removed my post and I really need someone right now i don't know what to do
