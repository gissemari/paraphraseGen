Welcome  I have found it helpful here 
You will be alright man. All you have to do is get up one time more than you fall down. I did it too after rehab. You will feel better figure out what caused it and try again and do something different than before.
I am sorry you are hurting.You are not alonehang in there.
Do you have a plan for what to do differently this time around?
I relapsed after going to outpatient rehab. But I am currently using what I learned there to stay sober. Drinking makes depression so much worse. You can do this!.IWNDWYT
