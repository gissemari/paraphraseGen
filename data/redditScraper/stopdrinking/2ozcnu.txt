so I hit the 2 star...so far quitting drinking has been a hell of a lot harder than quitting smoking. I am at 102 days free of the cigarettes and that is easy peasy...Drinking however has been a struggle. It has been a struggle because I have lost a lot of friends I have known for years and years. This hurts but I know its for the best these people just can't fathom life without drinking and it is all they do in their free time. ..I still haven't found the motivation to start working out but I can feel the fog starting the lift...I now look forward to having tea at night while I play my video games...I'm just continuing to take it one day at a time and focus on not drinking today. I'm looking forward to starting to work out and get healthy. I hate the idea of new years resolutions because they feel fake to me so I will just start working out when I feel it is time and my body is ready for it...SD has been a huge support for me I read it everyday and take away a lot from all of your stories...Thanks for being here and being awesome.

Congrats man! Good on your for being able to stay away from the drinking friends. I know it's hard but nothing worth it is easy. Sounds like you're pretty serious about this too. I love drinking tea at night while reading. I actually look forward to it now. ..Have a good day. 
Congrats!..Totally agree with new years resolutions comment.
Stopping drinking was hard because of the mental obsession associated with enjoyment of life as I then understood it.  That changed for me the day that I saw myself as a sober person and a happily sober person.  What I mean is that I took the mental and emotional leap from some one who wasn't just not drinking to someone who was by choice an ex-drinker.
