Crazy cravings eating so many sugary fatty foods! Been at KFC drive-though the last few days which is hillarious as I haven't eaten KFC for years. Not sure if they have the 'KFC Krush Bar' overseas but it's like a delicous icream shake thing eating 2 a day eeeeek. It's ok though I'm pretty slim so I've got a bit of temporary lenience I guess. Without the calories of alcohol I can afford to eat a bit more relaxed! Had a great evening with my partner and twinnies. Energy is bouncing back work was so much better fresh and not hung over. People at the office kept saying "You're back!" because of my mood alone. Little do they know it's because I'm not drinking myself into oblivion Sunday night and struggling to get through the Monday morning meeting anymore. Anyway thanks again to everyone here the support is amazing!

Hey just do what you gotta do ! Your body will likely just take in every bit of nutrition/protein and calories from all the food your eating in order to refuel you. Alcohol does something to your blood sugar levels so likely you will need a lot of carbohydrates to get you back to a good level 
That goes away with time. The junk food cravings will tapper off .
I ate a lot of ice cream at the beginning too. Glad you're here and sober today.
