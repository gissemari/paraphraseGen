I've been able to quit hard drugs (13+ years sober) and marijuana.  I was able to walk away and never look back.  I've even quit drinking for months a year + but lately I have slipped up over and over again..I woke up today and I wanted to post and say I'm really ready to stop drinking.  The problem I think I have been having is I have a problem with saying "never again".  That scares me.  One because I have not always had a problem drinking.  I drank heavily from the age of 18-22 then spent 1 year abstinent then 7 straight years of moderate drinking without any issue.  Then over the last few years I have been dealing with some mental health issues job issues family issues and I just began drinking more and more heavily.  If I say I can't drink ever again it makes me nervous.  There's so much pressure.  On the flip side if I don't say "never again" then I find excuses to just trying drinking again to see if I can drink moderately.  Only to end up drinking a whole 12 pack of beer when I intended to drink 3 or 4..I've been to rehabs I've been to AA I've been to SMART recovery I have a BA degree in Psychology and studied addiction.  I have spent years in therapy and taken medication for drinking cravings. I even thought about going into graduate school to pursue further studies on addiction issues.  I could write a book on all of the things I know  and learned.  But this is all intellectual knowledge I want action...Guys I am seriously at a point that I am pissed and fed up.  I do not want alcohol in my life anymore.  But I feel stuck.  Scared of making a commitment forever scared that one day at a time won't prepare me enough.  Maybe I am just overthinking this.   I am just pissed I keep relapsing.  I am getting married soon and having kids and I cannot be drinking.   I know that it's time for me to make a commitment set my intention.  Do you guys had any advice for me?..For those with long term sobriety what made it stick for you?

People find success just quitting for today not forever.  I will not drink with you TODAY.  It's just one little easy decision.  
The future and past don't exist. They are illusions. The past has already happened and the future hasn't happened yet nor is it guaranteed. Start living more in the present. Once you start doing that it will be easier to string hours of sobriety together...which will lead to days... which will lead to months... which will lead to years. 
*This Naked Mind.* ..College graduate and smart logical engineer here medically inclined. Fought alcohol loved and hated it understood it still couldn't walk away from it. Until one day when I was fed up and emotionally ready for the coercion that is *This Naked Mind.*..Yes I call it coercion. Lots of facts but sometimes facts aren't enough. I don't know how well it would work for a psychologist but it worked on me. Yes I picked apart the plot holes and scoffed at lots of it but I was open to the main threads that through repetition erased my *desire* to drink. Forever. And that was a big deal...If you do read it I recommend heeding the proscribed pace: ~2 chapters per day so it can simmer in the back of your mind and be reinforced the next day...Good luck!
The secret to quitting is:  we have to actually *quit doing* the thing.  .IWNDWYT 
I made a decision to stop using mind - altering substances when I was staring down a bag of drugs that I had taken before many times. I knew the path it would take me down and the associated suffering. I also realized I had been walking this exact path expecting enlightenment at the end for years. It can be likened to watching a movie over and over. If one has seen it why watch it again?..I made the decision to stop and do everything within my power to change my habits one day at a time. That is all any of us have. This included and includes accountability meditation  internal work physical and spiritual heightening  and group support via AA...The mind is the most powerful thing known to man in the universe. All the intellect within and the truth still cannot be found. The truth resides in the marrow of our bones and needs no explanation. If you suffer in your relationship with alcohol then why not let the truth seep into your marrow and move on?
