Let me start by saying my wife can be a raging bitch when she wants to. Extremely controlling and stubborn. I love her very much but its gotten pretty unbearable. I can go out with my friends or golfing and get drunk and all works out fine as long as my wife isn't involved. I have fun and all is ok. When I drink around her I have a tendency to get hammered. I don't know why but it's almost like revenge drinking. I have said some hurtful things to her in the past that have really damaged our relationship. We are on the brink of divorce. I have been going to AA but have slipped up twice in the last 2 months. She wants me to never have another drink ever again. I am struggling with that thought. I do think im an alcoholic but the only time I have problems is when she's around. I slip again she is gone. I have 2 small kids and I cannot bear to think about losing them. My brain is telling me it's ok to drink but if I do my marriage is over. I'm not sure if I'm even happy in this relationship anymore. Any advice?

Instead of committing now to never drinking again how about just give it a try for a while and see how things are then. You be the judge of how long a "while" is but I think it needs to be more than just a few weeks to get the full effect. You might be surprised...Full disclosure: I came very close to losing my own marriage under similar circumstances (more than once) but from the wreckage arose something stronger than it had ever been. I'm not so naive as to think every case is the same. I'm loyal to a fault but not as loyal as she is. 
Question? If you were your wife married to an alcoholic for how long now? Wouldn't you be a raging bitch when you "want" to also?..My ex did the smart thing-- she packed up the kids and left. I was out of control out of my mind and try as she may have at one point to save our marriage enough was enough. ..Simply put I drank her and the young kids away. This is why alcoholism is called a family disease for it effects all those around us. As why there is Alanon Alateen Adult Children Of Alcoholics right?..Her part is her part. Your part is being an alkie and doing something about that-- 1st things 1st. Starting with taking your own inventory not hers.
At this stage I'd place the decision to save or let go of your marriage on the shelf it's a red herring IMO...You acknowledge:..&gt;I do think im an alcoholic..and mention..&gt;My brain is telling me it's ok to drink..and..&gt;I can go out with my friends or golfing and get drunk and all works out fine..That's the alcoholic voice at work in your mind I recognise it from my own. ..Taking your wife out of the equation you'll still be an alcoholic and you'll likely find your drinking runs as bad as it ever has. And then where do you go?..My recommendation for now is work on your sobriety for YOU. You'll be amazed at how different the world becomes once that sober time builds once you get control of your own life free of this consuming dependency. Once sober time has built you may wish to save or let go of your marriage and that decision will be right for the sober you not driven by the alcoholic voice and it's needs...I projected my drinking onto my husband - I drank because he didn't love me enough or because he was getting on my back or just to spite him. Truth is my drinking was all on me and he's much less of a nag nowadays. Arguments can still be a trigger for me when I hear that voice "I'll drink to spite you" I shut it right down...Your wife might consider to try al-anon for some coping tools of her own.
In my experience there's no point in talking about the status of a marriage or about children. Or work or friends for that matter. ALL of that will go away. Drinking makes that choice for us. ..The real question is what you want to do for yourself. **Since you ask for advice** if you decide to stop drinking I suggest you do it for yourself and for yourself only. ..While it is true that if you continue to drink you are likely to lose your children I found that even that wasn't enough motivation for me to stop and my marriage wasn't either. I don't think I'm alone in this. If you stop and you do it for yourself then whatever happens you're in a better position to not drink in the future. Meaning that if you stop to save your marriage and your marriage ends nonetheless you don't need that as a reason to drink. ..As for the kids--what I risked was being able to be a good father and have my kids' respect. And my own as a parent. My oldest was old enough to notice that I was a drunk and today among the few things I'm proud of is that my teenage son can tell me he loves me and I can love him as a parent. But I had to stop drinking for myself to make this work. 
You might not be happy because you are an alcoholic - just as I am.  And I sure haven't been happy ... more like depressed extremely anxious personalising everything unable to keep friends - unless they were drinkers and unhappy at work.  So maybe you should just concentrate on the alcohol and what it means in your life.  Good on you for going to AA.  I relapsed twice or three times before getting better sobriety now.  I aiming for 30 days and then I'll reassess.
Don't blame your wife (or anyone else) for your problem with alcohol.
I cant tell you how many stories in AA include "then my wife left and I said 'now I can drink the way I want to'."..**universally the next part of the story is not good.** the roller coaster dips things speed up and the brick wall that was not in the original design for the ride appears...You can not control what she does you can not get - and stay sober for her. ..I was in a marriage that did not work - but I got sober before making any decisions - 4 years to be exact - right now you are in no shape to decide which sock to put on first let alone something that will seriously impact your life and your kids...find a way to get sober for yourself.  I slipped up in AA initially too.  Keep on going..
