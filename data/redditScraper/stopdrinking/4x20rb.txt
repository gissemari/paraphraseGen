2 concussions in 2 weeks relapsed after the 2nd. Back to the beginning my wife won't look at me until I am "healthy and well" and even then says the marriage is over. It's very hard to be healthy and well when she wont look at me.

You gotta be healthy and well for yourself because you want to be and know you deserve to be. Stay well my friend. Good luck at the drs 
I hope the CT went well. ..About the spouse -- For me drinking did not make my life better or the problems easier to deal with. Quite the opposite actually. Getting sober has not been a piece of cake but doing so has at least opened the door to the possibility that my marriage can be better. I can now do my part of our partnership and have the ability (no more drunken accusations or grudges over trivial things) to let him handle his part. No matter what happens sober me has much better chance of having a fulfilled life than drunk me could have even imagined. 
Ooof.  I have compassion for your suffering.  That sounds really tough.  I hope you find your way to healthy and well as soon as possible and are able to be gentle with yourself.  This sounds like a tough spot.
Ouch..I'm sorry to hear this. I hope the CT's go OK please let us know and please be careful!..I feel that being healthy comes first; and I know you can do it. There will be time to deal with everything else but right now focus on you and getting well. Hang in there!
I hear you man. I've been kicked out of the house for the past four months. It will be forever before I'm allowed back if ever. All I can do is just grind away in a bitter sobriety. Days sober? Three. (I'm tired of resetting my badge.)
