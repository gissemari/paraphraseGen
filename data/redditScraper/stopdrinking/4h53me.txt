I see a lot of posts today about people going to bars and tough situations. Some people relapsed others survived. ..Let me shake things up. Last night I had dinner with sober friends and went home and read. I made a decision to not test myself and to not place myself into harm. ..I'm not placing judgement here. I just want to provide some contrast. My story isn't exciting or eventful but it is an accurate description of the program of sobriety a lot of people work that does get a whole lot of advertisement.

My evening was even less eventful. Dinner with family parenting kids watched netflix and movies for the rest of the night. But hey. At least I made it through Friday!

I bailed on going out with friends last night and I was feeling a little down about it but reading this kind of cheered me up -- I think ultimately it was the right decision not to test myself. I went home and called my best friend instead and this morning I'm glad I did. Thanks for this!
Agreed; there's no need to test oneself that's foolish behavior. If people need to test themselves then they obviously have something to prove to themselves - and that insecurity should be examined not avoided through the testing of oneself.
