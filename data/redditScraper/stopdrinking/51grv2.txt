I've been having extremely detailed nightmares about picking up a drink that go on and on. I wake up then take a few minutes to realize they aren't real. Then it haunts me all day. I think I need to relax. If I had a drink would I be disappointed? Yes. Would it be the end of the world? No. Could I come right on back here with no judgement? Yes. It's easy to support people who have relapsed and say these things to them. As you all know though we are much harder on ourselves...If I relapse and am too hard on myself I know what will happen. I will say fuck it you could never do this to begin with. Might as go all out!! Cue bender....but I won't do that. ..I will relax. I will not drink today. I will trust myself on the path I am taking and know one step back will never negate the million steps forward I have already taken. I invite everyone to relax with me and be kind to yourselves...We can do this...Love .butt_dance

I'm with you! I count ten deep breaths from the deepest depths of my abdomen and remember to forgive myself for everything I've done only never to forget.
