Not sure if it'll gain any traction but hopefully it reaches at least one other person who has a similar struggle. I am working on making it past the day measurement and being able to say X number of weeks or months since I've had a drink but I've felt like I keep stalling out...A little turns to a lot followed by just saying I won't do it again and making minimal progress. As far as I'm concerned I refuse to resign myself to failing at quitting. To anyone else starting at zero days again I am with you IWNDWYT.

Cheers to zero. It's not a good number but it comes before one and that's all it takes to start. IWNDWYT
One day at a time.  I can not drink 1 day.  A bunch of day ones add up.  I can't look to far ahead because it is overwhelming.  One day though I can do.  You can do this if I can do this.
Hey I am at zero again too. Had a flight last night than drank more and was really stupid. Have a beer left in my room that I am going to pour down the sink now. I won't drink with you today.
You are not not not alone!!!! It took me many many fails to get a day. Like .. two years of thinking and another of trying. Just keep going
Do y'all have support? Do you have like minded people to talk to and to bounce ideas off of?..This is not a matter of will power. It wanting to stop and stopping were a thing no one would be drunk and we could all be sober and happy. ..The hardest thing for me was to ask for and then accept help. Human in person help. ..IWNDWYT
