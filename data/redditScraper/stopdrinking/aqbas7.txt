This time last year I spent Valentine's day in a 30 day rehab and was so focused on sobriety and mental health that I almost forgot it was even Valentine's day (not that I really care anyway it's a bullshit capitalist holiday).  I had 7 months sober and then relapsed for a bit...This Valentine's day I'll have 16 days sober haven't dated in over 2 years and have a lot of work to do on myself but I'm happy.  Shit could be so much worse.  This year I'm going easy on myself and just giving thanks to these past 16 days I have clean.  IWNDWYT! (Or tomorrow or the next day!)

Love seeing people dump on capitalism in SD! Congrats on over 2 weeks sober; we're of an age sobriety-wise me and you. In my experience romantic relationships after a long period of being single are so wonderful. If you decide to be in one again I hope you have the same thing happen to you.
Happy Sober 16 (tomorrow)! Why don't they have cards for this. 
I'm single also and if you look at my previous post .You will see I'm taking the money I saved on booze and buying myself a nice vase of roses and a big juicy.Steak to cook at home. I will love myself this .Valentine's day. You should do the same!
