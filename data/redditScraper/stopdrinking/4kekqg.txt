I have heard a number of times that people wish they had more time particularly since there are so many SD members with long-term sobriety...But don't sell yourself short. We get sober one day at a time. You too can reach higher numbers! But we can't rush it...I never thought that I would reach a year. I relapse every two weeks for probably one or two years. But I added supports and Recovery work. And that seemed to help. Day by day the days added up. But to me what is more important than the counter is the Daily Commitment to stay sober just for today. Best wishes everyone

Thank you and what a great post!!! One day at a time for me. 17 days is such a small amount of time  but for me a huge victory. No more detox sleeping ok and guilt and shame is barely being replaced with motivation and conviction that I can do this... One day at a time. 
Good Post. I look at it like lifting weights. It takes time to be able to really lift the heavy weights. It takes determination and hard work. I am building my sobriety muscles by putting days under my belt and learning new ways to deal with this thing we all have. Everyday I make it through is like another pound on the bar. ( Not sure why I am going with a weight lifting metaphor it just came into my head LOL )
