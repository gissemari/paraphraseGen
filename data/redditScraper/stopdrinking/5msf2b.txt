Hey guys..Quick question for you all as explained in the title...I am currently trying to gain weight having got myself a personal trainer at the gym around 4 months ago (the gym has been a lifesaver to me for the last week sober). ..Now previously my only vice to the gym wasn't actually the gym but my eating routine. I found it extremely difficult to get the 3500 calories a day I needed to gain weight. ..After 7 days sober? I literally cannot stop eating. I'm a hard gainer which means I struggle to gain weight and I've been vegan for a few years so I'm basically on weight gain hard mode. However this week I've found it almost too easy to get my full calorie count in by 8pm and then have to stop myself from eating much more!..How has everyone else been affected by going sober? Are you eating more or less? Has your figure responded positively or are you having to work to keep it how it was when you were drinking?

I'm right with you. Ever since I quit I have a way bigger appetite! It's a good thing because I am a pretty thin guy so I need to get enough calories or else I will look like a twig . 
I'm eating a lot more too. I'm thin and do yoga and weight training. Initially I lost 10 % of my body weight but due to the sugars in alcohol I'm craving carbs. I'm just trying to balance my diet. I haven't gained much weight but imagine all the empty calories we gave up when we quit drinking! I did notice that there was a reduction in my belly size though.
I can't stop eating.  I have been eating everything in sight.  My pants are getting pretty damn tight.
