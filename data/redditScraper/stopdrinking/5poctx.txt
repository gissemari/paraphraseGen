Hi all.First time poster just passed my 6 month mark (yay!) and though I'm finding that the constant obsession has lifted I am still struggling with how to start rebuilding my life it all still seems a little overwhelming. Alongside my daily recovery program I thought doing a retreat would be a good way to give me something to look forward to and hopefully give me some space to refocus. However everything I find online seems to be for rehab/detox rather than for people already in recovery. Does anyone know of a good UK retreat with a recovery focus? I know AA run some and I am involved in the program but fancied something with a new perspective. .Thanks x.
