I check in here every day but post infrequently. During the early days I was in outpatient therapy. I learned about triggers relapses and poison thinking. At around 60 days I went to my first AA meeting. After six months the outpatient program was finished. By then AA served as support and a road map to a better life. I picked up r/stopdrinking after I had surgery was immobilized for 8 weeks. Today I use this sub and AA as my sober reference points. I've learned to stop comparing myself to others. I let things go. I am calmer and more focused. There is always work ahead. There is always a risk of relapse. I guard my sobriety but will freely tell you what worked for me. This is a nice milestone. I am happy to be here.
