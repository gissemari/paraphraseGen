----------immediate responses--------

I'm watching the Australian Open right now at 1am thinking back to when I was there last year for work scared out of my mind because I had just stopped drinking was still having crazy drinking dreams and faced boozy situations on the daily...Fast forward to today 384 days sober (!!!) and so thankful for the sport of Tennis for bringing me such joy everyday while watching and for providing a calmness as a professional industry to work in.  So happy so optimistic.
I'm thankful for the fourth calm morning in a row. ..Usually mornings were a stressful start to the day. Me dragging myself out of bed hungover and tired grabbing as much coffee and cigarettes as humanly possible to try and kick start my day. Normally I forgotten to iron uniforms or just plain couldn't be bothered the night before after wine so having to do that get lunches ready the kids dragging their heels and always ended up with me losing my patience and shouting at them...This week I've set my alarm an hour earlier so I can grab a coffee or two and check forums before my day starts and the kids are up. Uniforms are ironed the night before I'm organised with PE uniforms and lunches. I don't need time for cigarettes as I gave up smoking along with the booze. My eldest commented this morning how nice is has been to get a 'proper' hot breakfast this week rather than some cereal and milk flung at them. ..Everything is calm and I'm patient and I didn't realise how much the stressful mornings were impacting on my mood for the rest of the day. My kids have been so well behaved I haven't needed to shout once all week and they've been really helpful around the house.
I'm grateful for a bit of a loop I'm stuck in which is the practice of meditation.  The practice helps me focus on gratitude which makes me more positive and kind throughout the day which gives me happier interactions and better relationships to be MORE grateful for in the next meditation and so on ad infinitum!  I could not have done that hungover.  
I'm thankful I found this sub a year ago (according to the cake icon!)...You all collectively have and continue to change my perspective on life...I'm grateful for that.
I'm thankful today for my youngest child who is turning 8. Who loved me even when I was a crazy drunk. Who loves me still. And who I can now love properly that I'm fully sober the way he deserves. 
I'm thankful for my younger brother who inspires me to keep making good decisions so we can eventually get back to shit talking each other about who's more successful (he's been kicking my ass in this department for the past 7-8 years haha). One day at a time. 
I'm grateful to my family who have shown me unconditional love no matter how many times I've thrown it back in their face...I'm grateful to the hostel that put a roof over my head and gave me a safe place to at least try to get sober when I was in the gutter...I'm grateful for the unrelenting kindness of people in AA when I seem to keep making progress then slipping up...I'm grateful for the fact that in this last relapse my mind was raring to go but just for once my heart wasn't really in it...I am grateful to this site which is the only place I found (including AA) where people are prepared to be open and honest about sex - although I only signed up this morning I've been visiting when I've had anxieties about sex for a while...I'm grateful that I didn't cause any collateral damage in my relapse although I must accept that the mere fact of my relapse will have caused some people pain...I'm grateful to be alive...Sorry. That's 7 reasons.
I am thankful for today. Today has that special good day feel to it for me and instead of questioning it I'm just going to go with it and see what today can bring :) 
I am grateful for my 8 year old daughter who like the previous poster loved me when I was a ridiculous drunk and still loves me...I am thankful for a job interview I have on Friday that I have been wanting for a long time...I am thankful for my partner . .although we went through hell much of it due to my drinking has been so supportive and forgiving.  ..I am thankful for my home my family my sweet little dog and my health...I am grateful for the wake up call I had a few days ago which has been thr catalyst for me to stop drinking.  I am so looking forward to a future with no alcohol.
I'm thankful for all the feelings I'm feeling today. Good or bad I'm just glad they're there and that I am fully here and aware to process them.
I am thankful and grateful for my amazingly supportive fiance who in my sobriety I will marry...I am thankful and grateful for the peace of mind that going to a detox facility (a great one at that!!) gave me after drinking from age 16-24 copious amounts of alcohol. My anxiety has all but disappeared since I stopped drinking. I am also thankful and grateful for their amazing staff and the tools the bestowed upon me to live a fulfilling life without booze...I am thankful and grateful for this sub. I was once a lurker now a sobernaut. I feel better than I have ever felt and it is amazing to have a sub filled with such positive like-minded individuals...I will not drink with you all today.
I will not drink today! I'm loving the no hangover work week- honestly I really don't know how I was able to function like that on a regular basis- 3-4 times during a work week...FOR YEARS!.Have a great Thursday sobernauts!  
I'm thankful for the sunny day today. The cold and dark always makes it hard to get motivated so the sun shining right now makes it easier to say that I will not drink today! 
I'm thankful that everything in my life is going alright.  I've got money in the bank we're doing pretty good toward saving up for a house (not drinking every weekend has really boosted the savings!)  
I am thankful for this sub having an outlet is amazing. I will not drink with you all today!
I'm thankful that since starting me new job and coming out as a lesbian my confidence and self-esteem is often through the roof. I am free to be myself and I've made friends where in the past I didn't think I ever would.
I am thankful for the nice people I met at my first aa meeting this week. It probably wasn't the right meeting for me but they made me feel welcome and accepted.  I am thankful for the quiet time in the morning my job allows me. It helps me get my day started off right. I am thankful for this sub and the chat.  The people here really help keep me on track and pick me up when I am feeling down. 
I am in the 4th week of sobriety. Thankful Thursday. Will not drink with you today or even alone
I'm grateful to the four sober people in my life who showed me over the last couple of years that giving up booze or drugs was not the end of your life but the opposite. I would not have been able to make this leap without their examples. I wanted what they have and now I'm on the way to getting it. 
I'm grateful for the good nights of sleep this week my newly sparkling eyes the perpetual icky stomach feeling that has disappeared my amazing body that is by the hour curing itself of the poisoning that had been thrust upon it all these years and especially the angels (friends colleagues family) around me who put up with my baloney. And of course for this sub and its members. (Thank you!)  I will not drink with you today. 
I am thankful for my two kids who despite me being sober are still a pain in the ass to get out the door in the morning:)
Giving thanks for everyone who makes it possible for me to pursue a huge dream and for seeing the hard work pay off. Grateful for my dog who adds a dimension of inexpressible joy to my life; for the change of seasons; for being healthier; for those with the courage to fight.
I am grateful for my coffee the silence in the morning my family computer games and for each one of you who inspire me to make it for one week today!
1 - I'm thankful that my Dr was so supportive.  I'd never met her before and she was so helpful and proud of me for going in on my own free will and not being forced in and the steps and initiative I was taking that she almost made me cry the last time I met with her...2 - I'm thankful for my kids ALWAYS wanting to play with them or read to them.  It's an easy fun distraction to not think about drinking in the evenings...3 - I'm thankful for the absolutely stunning sunset last night which my kitchen window faces.  I spent a good hour and a half making lasagna last night which would've been prime drinking time.  But I watched it through the window as I cooked and it was beautiful...4 - I'm thankful my husband is away for work (don't get me wrong I'm so in love with my husband it's sickening and so wish he was here) but when he's gone the kids sleep in my room/bed with me and I get precious snuggles because I know they're not going to be little forever...5 - And as I also posted in the daily check in I'm thankful for the unbelievably realistic vivid albeit weird dreams I've been having.  They're wonderful and I'd forgotten how great dreams can be and how they can make you feel.  You don't get dreams like that when you pass out from drinking that's for sure.
I'm thankful for the health and fitness journey I am on. It feels good to be in control again and be someone I am proud of. Life is slowly..slowly coming together despite it feeling really low sometimes. .I'm thankful 
I'm thankful for:..This sub..My SO who has put up with my crap for *years*..Sleeping naturally and dreaming and remembering both rather than waking up not knowing how you got into bed or what day it even is (missed work once because of this)..Eating and enjoying food again rather than skipping meals in favor of vodka/powerade (my worst binge was 5 days of this and no food whatsoever)..Feeling my mood and personality going back to my normal nicer self (and no more angry driving)
grateful for: ..* The writing facilitator training I'm about to finish up and the opportunity to make writing more accessible to folks in my community.* AA. I've only been to a handful of meetings but it's really doing a lot for my attitude (and gratitude). I dropped a pretty personal share on Wednesday (that I didn't realize was going to be so personal until I was halfway through it--classic me) and I received so much compassion in response (that I didn't really know what to do with but I'm trying to be okay with that). It was so kind. Thinking about it now makes me tear up..* The hella fancy tea I was gifted during the holidays--since I've cut out coffee too it has been a lifesaver..* Pajama rompers. Like seriously I want to live in a pajama romper. Forever. At all times. FOREVER. GIVE ME ALLLLL THE PAJAMA ROMPERS..* My body has been exhibiting some trauma side effects that are unpleasant but I'm feeling really grateful for it--because in a way it feels validating. Like this is a physical real tangible thing that is happening to me. .* Almost 30 days of no booze even though it feels like longer since I was moderating heavily through December. I feel clear-headed and open-hearted for the first time in many years..* This sub because I check in here several times a day just to read stories and touch base. I'm grateful for all of the vulnerability truth and encouragement here..
Today I'm thankful for my serenity and the ability I've learned in sobriety to maintain a level head when surprises happen and being able to be of service to others. I found out about two hours ago that my sister's whole family has come down with some variety of stomach plague and I was able to take a break from what I was doing grab some things for them at the grocery store and come back to my work. All without freaking out or loosing my cool...While I was drinking I would have shrugged off their illness with a 'sucks to be them' attitude and gone about my business of maintaining my buzz. Or I would have flown off the handle about how they were going to die because my lizard brain always led every situation back to a life or death flip of the coin. But today I was able to empathize with my family manage my work situation to find time for a break be of service to my family and come back to what I was doing. It feels good to be sober today :)
I'm thankful for my privilege and hope to use it to help others.  I'm thankful for this sub in helping me keep a healthy perspective.  I'm thankful to have a job and a warm house.
Thankful for my days despite experiencing some of the rougher edges of life the past couple years.
I am thankful for (1) this sub (2) my sister (3) a few very helpful friends (4) my cat (5) la croix...I will not drink with you today.
I am thankful that one week ago today is the last time I drank (disregard the badge it needs updating).  I am thankful I woke up sober in my own house and without wine stained lips or a heart heavy with shame. I haven't made it this far in awhile and I owe a bunch of that to this subreddit! I will not drink with you today Reddit! 
I'm thankful that I went to the chiropractor.   That i got some sleep.  That my headache went away.  I'm thankful my eye finally stopped twitching!   Thankful for Coffee. 
I'm thankful that I didn't give in to my urges and stop at the liquor store on the way home from work. That was hard to do today.
I slipped up last night.  I received a promotion at work and one of my friends bought a bottle of wine for me as a celebratory present.  I hadn't told anyone that I decided to quit drinking so I didn't know what to say I just accepted it and thanked her.  I could have done a lot of things after that... I could have put the bottle away somewhere I couldn't get to it I could have quietly given it away to someone else I could have sacked up and told my friend that I appreciated her lovely gesture but I have decided to stop drinking and maybe she could drink it for me in celebration.  I could even have just poured it down the sink.  But I didn't.  I came home I made dinner I told myself "Just one glass" and I drank the whole bottle.  :(   Then to make things worse I was so aghast and miserable this morning that I called in to work and just pulled the covers over my head and cried from guilt and sadness most of the day.   Why do I let this awful stuff have so much power over me?  ..I am not going to give up.  I refuse to give up.  Today I did not drink.
Today I am thankful for the internet.  I remember as a kid this wild web wasn't here.  It makes so much simpler for me right now: homeschooling work sober support professional development and education.  Very cool.  (though I have to limit my facebook time or I get way depressed)..I am thankful for flexibility in both of my awesome jobs so that I can work both of them and homeschool my kid too...I am thankful for my awesome mother that helps with kid and his lessons and is always up for an adventure or a cup of tea...I am thankful for the sunshine today even if I didn't really get out in it much.  It was beautiful and gives me hope for Spring...I am thankful for all of you here on this sub who post comment share trials and triumphs and really get it.  You rock!
I am grateful to be alive and sober today. I am grateful for my sober friends their inspiration humor and support.
I'm not very good at sapping feel good stuff generally but today I am happy and thankful!.I'm thankful to be alcohol free since New Years Eve..Thankful to be alive..Thankful for my two boys and wife..Thankful to be employed..Thankful to have a roof over my head and food in my belly..Thankful that I did not drink today!..Things could be a hell of a lot worse I'd say..
Why does everything look so different suddenly on my screen?
I'm grateful to this sub SD and to all of you who share support and contribute here. I draw strength from you every day and know in my heart I could not do this without you...I'm also grateful for a clear head growing confidence in myself and stiff turds but that is another story ... Ha.
