Here I am again! I've been trying to quit off and on for the past 2 years with 116 days being the longest stretch of sobriety I've ever had. Lately I've been struggling to get more than 2 days together. But all of this has helped me to realize that I'm in the right place doing the best thing I can do. Getting sober...I remember going to my first AA meeting a year and a half ago. I just didn't feel right calling myself an alcoholic. For months every time we did introductions and I had to say I was an alcoholic it just didn't feel right. Now years later I know that I am truly an alcoholic. I can honestly say that I depend on alcohol for every aspect of my life. I drink when I'm happy when I'm sad when I'm pissed off bored shy embarrassed you name it...I'll find an excuse to drink...Recently I heard my daughter praying for all of us (my family) not to be sick. I realized that she was praying for me! I had let myself down as a mom and I wasn't raising my daughter right. I wasn't giving her my all leading her to become her best self. How could I be when I wasn't holding high expectations for myself? ..There are so many layers of BS that I will have to uncover as I become sober. So many aspects of myself that are fucked up and broken. I know that this journey will be harder than ever and at times it will suck so hard. But I'm starting today! ..Thanks for being here! I have relied on all of you so much already you have no idea. Please keep posting the good and the bad. I need to hear it all...I will not drink with you today!.

I will not drink with you today!..Knowing that my daughter is proud of me for not drinking is worth alcohol's weight in gold. So much better than the temporary feeling alcohol gives and that's not even mentioning the lack of hangovers!..One day at a time. AA has been a good system for me.
