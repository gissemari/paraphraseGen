So *so* many of us struggle at all stages of sobriety with that sneaky thought of "Man I could *really* use a drink right now!"..Fortunate as I have been with mostly mild and infrequent cravings they still pop up in all forms..."It's been such a stressful day! I deserve a drink!".."Man I'm bored. I always used to enjoy things more with a drink maybe just one or two.....".."Craft beer party? Well it would be just plain *rude* to go and not try some...."..Etc. Etc. Etc. This is nothing new to most of us...And sobriety is *full* of upsides. But I used to find that I would only focus on them well here on SD when typing. Not that I didn't experience them but that I didn't actually verbalize it to myself *at the time*...What I mean by that is this: Now when I am doing something stressful physical entertaining etc I try to take a second to *appreciate and mentally verbalize* that I am enjoying that moment sober..."I'm running late for work! Gotta rush! **I'm so glad I am doing this without a hangover**".."Two miles down! One more to go before my run is over! **I'm grateful I am sober and in a physical shape to complete this run**".."It such a peaceful night eating ice cream on the porch. **I'm thankful I am fully present and will remember this tomorrow**"..It's not every time but by reminding myself in the moment where sobriety is proving the rewards it helps me remember those events *and the positive emotions behind them* when I am struggling with cravings. ..(Sips tea while finishing this before bed and looking forward to the sober restful sleep ahead)

Excellent. I'm having a bit of a rough week - will try this. Thanks my sober friend. 
Thank you.  I would also add having difficult encounters/difficulties at work thank goodness I don't have a hangover . . . 
love this.  Thanks for the great tool!!
Yes! I do this too! Every morning waking up hangover free. It's the best!
Nice. I do find myself saying thank God I'm sober to be able to deal with this right now. ..I heard that this like many things need to practiced so they are your first reaction. Like a first responder.

Yes! Excellent advise and something I sort of discovered for myself but you've explained infinitely better than I could. Great post.
I need to incorporate this in my sobriety. There's always this vague sense that I'm better off in situations sober but I need to more intentional about it. Thanks for spelling it out so clearly!
I like how you emphasize the mindfulness in the sober moment. Many times I just think about "not drinking" but I'm going to try thinking more about how good each moment feels because of being sober. Thank you!
I think despite my recent lapse that mindfulness is one of the keys for me so thank you for this post as one more tool for my toolbox!
It's easy to forget the day to day struggle I went through while I was drinking.  Since I've been sober I've been going to the movie theater once a week and reveling in the fact that I can sit still for two hours without having to get up and pace around gag and burp up my acid stomach constantly on the edge with nerves shot wondering if I might pass out or die of a heart attack at any second...Not even the hangover but I'm grateful I don't have to deal with withdrawals ever again as long as I don't pick up today.
Thank you for posting this SA I'm going to start doing this. Actually I did think to myself whilst cycling to work this morning 'just think Bone you wouldn't do this with a hangover'...It's true and I must remember to be grateful for my sobriety. It helps me make better life decisions.

Well done! Gratitude has carried me a really long way. I'm so glad it's working for you.
Excellent advice. I've found myself conscious of positive reinforcement while life's obstacles pop up. This enables me to keep my drinking thinking in check. Mind over matter? For me yes a sober Mind takes care of all that matters in a responsible way. Thanks for the reinforcement.
Great point. ..I actually have another point to add I think we romanticize drinking WAY too much when we forget what drinking really was like. The last time I relapsed I was at home by myself when the wife and kids were out of town I remembered thinking to myself how nice and relaxing it would be to have a few beers in the evening and next thing I knew I brought home a 12 pack. Well what followed that night was not relaxing nor fun especially after polishing off all 12 beers the next morning the very familiar hang-over I got was really thing only I had to show for after the night of drinking not much else at all. 
Thanks. This is a good idea. I'm on day 2 and Im thankful that I feel good this morning.
This is great advice! Definitely going to use this thank you :)
My friend taught me something similar he said anytime I was stressed about having to do something e.g. "I have to go to work today and deal with my asshole boss" to change it to "I get to". "I get to be sober today I get to go to work. I get to..." whatever it is. Same kind of idea incorporating gratitude in to your day to day sober life to make it a little easier to stay sober another night.
