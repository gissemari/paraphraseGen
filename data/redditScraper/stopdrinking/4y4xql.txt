I had an absolutely awful dream about my ex last night. I woke up feeling like shit. I know a lot of people here struggle with dreams so any encouragement you can provide is appreciated. I have no clue why I've remained obsessed with this girl for 17 months after we've broken up. It's a big part of the reason I started drinking so much a year ago.

I'm sorry that it was upsetting. I hate the way feelings linger after an emotional dream. When my head starts cyclic emotional stuff I try to keep it busy with something productive. I figure my brain is trying to tempt me into drinking and I am NOT going to be manipulated by my own thoughts. I'm here for you and not drinking with you today!
It's true that I have not had any drinking dreams for YEARS but in the last week I had two.  Dreams of all [sort including drinking dreams](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2dit1m/what_do_drinking_dreams_mean/) are "counterfactuals" which bizarrely allow us to explore all sorts of what ifs.  Another thing that might be helpful to keep in mind alcoholism is at bottom both a physical ailment and an obsessive compulsive disorder.  In recovery especially early recovery many of us have the experience of obsessing over troubled or lost relationships.  When I first got sober in 1986 it was nearly a year after my first wife and I separated.  I got it into my newly sober brain that I needed to "heal" that relationship and I can quite assure you that all I did was lots of additional damage to someone who did not deserve it--by placing my needs ahead of hers.  ..Good luck.  Time especially SOBER time heals everything.
