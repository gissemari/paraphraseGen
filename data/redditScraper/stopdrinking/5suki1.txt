Hello SD! I'm curious if anyone else experienced this during early days of sobriety. I see most people struggle with insomnia whereas I have the opposite problem. I'm sleeping 12 hours a night and as soon as I get off work I take a 2 hour nap... I'm still so drained though. Does anyone else have similar sleep issues? Any input or advice is greatly appreciated!

Totally normal and exactly what I experienced over the first 3 weeks. I could not get enough sleep. Lunch hour after work at night...sleep sleep sleep. The way I looked at it: my body was resetting itself after years of drinking. Happy to report today I am back to my normal 7 hours of sleep and have tons of good energy. No hangovers for the win!
Oh yes.  This time around I was sleeping 11-12 hours straight and was drained.  My advice is just take it easy and sleep as much as you can if that's what you body is telling you.  My body had to readjust.  Now I'm at something like 7 1/2.
All I did was sleep and eat for weeks once I got thru detox. I always thought I needed to drink to sleep but the alcohol was just keeping me from getting the restful and rejuvenating sleep I needed. Your body is playing catch up! 
Thanks for the replies yall I'm glad I'm not alone! I can't wait to get some energy back though.  I feel so unproductive.
I'm on day 15 (don't let the flare fool you!) and I am SOOOO tired!
I am the same! So so tired! And my face is breaking out with a weird rash too. I find that some of it is dehydration and if I force myself to chug lots of water I feel/look a little better. My physical self is going through some kind of reset though. I can't wait until it is over! ..I will not drink with you today!
