It has taken almost 200 days but I am finally identifying as a non drinker. Not as a person who has given up something but has someone who has gained a lot in sobriety. It took a lot of time to get here but now that I am here I feel truly grateful...I told my spouse the other day that I am at a point in my sobriety where if he wanted to go out and have a drink with his friend I would be more than happy to be a designated driver and pick him up. My spouse told me that he has chosen not to drink again partly in solidarity with me but partly because alcohol has created chaos in his life is well. Not because of his drinking but because of mine. I actually use alcohol free mouthwash because the smell of alcohol repulses my spouse. It reminds him of some really dark times in our marriage. He is also been affected by the alcoholism of other family members...Since quitting drinking I think I have called in sick once to work. As opposed to the regular Monday call out because I was hungover mind you it was never restricted to Mondays. When I called in sick last Thursday because I was really struggling with anxiety I didn't feel any guilt. My work was very supportive and told me to take care of myself. & I didn't feel like I was taking advantage of my work because it was a legitimate reason to call in sick. It wasn't because I was hungover. I know that sounds like such a little thing but it felt really good. I used to feel such shame / calling in sick and fearful that everyone would know that I was an alcoholic. My boss is not an idiot I'm sure she had an idea. But that is neither here nor there. Now when I call in sick I can do so without shame...There are so many things to be grateful for. I'm grateful for the support of my spouse. And our marriage has never been stronger. We have been married for over 10 years and together for about 15. Since becoming sober I am spending a lot more quality time with him. Everyday I tell him I love him and that I love our marriage. & I mean it every time. When I was drinking I wanted to divorce. Turns out it wasn't a problem with our marriage it was a problem with me. I was unhappy and lying and causing chaos in our marriage...There is still a part of me that has worries that oh my god he is going to catch me lying! Not because I'm lying but because that was something I did for many years. He was out of town and we did a video phone call & I scanned the room with the phone to show him the cats and dogs. I had a moment of worried that he might see bottles of booze. That was so weird. It was so familiar lying and hiding that I'm still worried about that. Even though there were no bottles of booze around!..So in short I am seeing the gifts of sobriety but there are still a few things that I am stuck in remnants of the past and specifically of my past behaviour. Every time I think Oh my god he is going to catch me lying or he is going to see a booze bottle I have to remind myself that I'm not lying and I'm not drinking! Its funny how the brain takes time to relearn. And I am so grateful for the relief I experience when I quickly remember that I am no longer engaging in those behaviors...I am also grateful that my sleep and anxiety is so much better. Not perfect but so much better. I have sobriety to thank for that...Thanks for listening!
