Never was an everyday drinker but I found that I enjoy my weekends a lot more when I spend them sober.  Can't say that I've missed the bottle not even a little.  Lost almost 15 lbs. too even though I'm a sodaholic now.  I'm hoping that subsides...Still battle anxiety a bit but I finally made it back into the gym the other day and it did wonders.  I expect that time will further soften the edge at least I hope so.  Not having to deal with panic attacks is nice...To everyone else caught up early in the struggle - it gets easier with each passing day.  If you find yourself in a low place there are a lot of healthy ways to mitigate the unpleasant feelings.  I've come to the realization that Alcohol is procrastination in liquid form.  The piper will come to collect his toll sooner or later.
