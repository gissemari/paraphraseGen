As the title states I much liked the idea of creating a day-to-day update for r/stopdrinking on my recovery. Taking my cue from [u/2-damn-old-for-this](http://www.reddit.com/u/2-damn-old-for-this) I  also feel too damn old for this. It's time to stop. But this time it's time to stop for good...I'm 31 live in Los Angeles and have basically been an alcoholic for 11 years. My drink of choice is vodka and depending on the day or bender I'm on I range from around 600ml-1L a day. I've tried quitting twice last year and many times this year. Last year I made it to 45 days once during the summer and then another 45 days in the fall. Both times i've relapsed around the 45 day mark and I have no idea why but I know not attending meetings or getting additional continual help is the big reason. This time I plan on being more proactive. A big problem for me seems to be finding adequate support. It may sound strange but NONE of my friends are alcoholics and I don't know any recovering alcoholics I can contact for support. If anyone on this subreddit is also from the LA/Pasadena/Glendale area I would really appreciate any communication or help. I also don't socialize very well (or at all) and my only friend technically is my roommate who works most days until 7p. I myself and unemployed (and with no insurance-- which is why all my rehab/detox options are extremely expensive)...Today is Day 1. But I can't count how many Day 1s and even up to Day 2s I've roller coasted through the last several months. This time I want it to stick so maybe even as a self-guilt thing I'm posting on this subreddit to try to guilt myself into STAYING sober...I don't want to drink anymore. It's obviously ruined my life and I need to start taking control of my life again...And here we go with withdrawal again. I do have some lorazepam (ativan) I received from a doctor (on one of the countless times I've tried to quit) left so I'm hoping its enough to get me through this. I also have a couple librium left from my last several failed attempts at stopping but I really didn't like how it made me feel. In fact I don't even like pills all that much so I try to avoid taking even the Ativan. I have yet to take any today and I feel it. Last night my last drink was at 8p and I took an ativan  around 11p when the withdrawal was setting in and I just wanted to sleep. Today I'm trying to hold off on taking the ativan until it just gets too much to bear...Symptoms: Panic panic panic sweaty hypertension (i have had high blood pressure and do take lots of medication for it but it's always worse during withdrawal) racing heart every so often extreme nausea dry heaves inability to sleep and of course when and if I can get some sleep waking up FREEZING to death in my own sweat multiple times a night.  ..I love reddit I've been a redditor for about 5 years (this acct is obviously my anon acct) and I'm glad there's a support system subreddit for people like us. You can call me M. and I look forwarding to meeting many of you and building up my flair...In 3 and a half hours it'll be 24 hours. I just hope it doesn't get WORSE rather BETTER as the hours go. But I know it's probably going to be hell for at least 3 days.

I drank like you did. I absolutely feel your pain.  We are here for you. Hold on it does get better. 
This might sound like overkill to some but I use https://chains.cc/ along with the subreddit badge to track my days without drinking...Counting days and being proud of myself for that is sometimes all I got. Last year it seemed like Day 20 was when I would always end up drinking. Day 21 came several weeks ago this time and it was a relief. Just get yourself to Day 46!
