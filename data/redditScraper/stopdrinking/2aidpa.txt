Don't get me wrong I still usually go clubbing every week and have a great time sober (I'm actually having better luck with the ladies than I was whilst drinking). But there are inevitably nights where I am left at home while all my friends are out getting plastered. These nights are rough and the urge to relapse can be strong...What I'm asking is what do you do to stay busy on nights where you used to be our partying what's your new sober way of enjoying the night?

*read engage yourself in some reading that you find entirely pleasurable--get lost in a book or series...*learn a new skill whats something you've always wanted to do but never took the time to commit to learning?  Im sure you have a list if you think about it...*call someone.  anyone--have a long conversation about whats going on in your life.  I realized recently (having stopped drinking equally recently) that until I have been pretty terrible about actually talking about the things that are going badly or really well in my life--all of my conversations existed on the surface of my existence.  I am only just beginning to have conversations that penetrate any deeper than this and it is rewarding (if not difficult)..*binge watch some badass tv.  thanks netflix and hulu.. .these are the things I could think of and type up quickly not comprehensive by any stretch.
