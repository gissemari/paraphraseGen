TL;DR:  Bartender.  Trying to better self.  WAS sober for 48 hours.  The addiction is strong in this one.  Mini cry for help from a community that understands...Put your big boy pants on cause this is going to be a long one.  Alcohol has ran my life for about the last 10 years.  I've worked in the alcohol industry in many forms but most currently a bartender at a local touristy place.  It started as just a few drinks after work to decompress but has gone into doing boilermakers and going to bed.  I'm active and exercise a lot but the weight has just thrown on like no other.   My source to calm my anxiety and stress has been alcohol to chill me out but all it does is medicate me and make me useless to society for the rest of the day. .. I finally have started putting my foot down to my habits and have been trying to better myself.  I started running and doing kettle bells with my gf which feels like a good start.  I'm terrible at running but I've been an avid cyclist for years and it hasn't done much for me over the years except keep my legs toned.  I'm currently 48 hours sober and started getting the itch for a drink after a 9 hour day of bartending and having to boot drunks out at the end of the night.  My bike ride home I kept passing by bars in my neighborhood and just couldn't help myself.  I told myself I would order a drink look at it and tell myself I didn't need it.  I stared at this dumb shot of whiskey for about 15 minutes until I finally got angry and took a sip.  I practically threw up but muscled through it.  I feel like I have not only failed myself but my girlfriend who loves and supports me in trying to quit.  I don't know how to hold back these cravings.  Smoke weed??  Exercise more?  I just feel like I want to stand up and power through this but I feel weak to so much temptation.  Especially in a city with a more than thriving brewing community and more bars within walking distance of my house than I can count on my fingers and toes.  Any insight or just general conversation on your struggles or what helped you would definitely help me.

I feel your pain buddy. I bartended for 12  years. I was behind a bar before I was even old enough to be in front of one. My drinking too kept escalating. It turned from having a few after work to getting blackout after work every time I worked. After getting fired from my 3rd job for alcohol related problems I decided to quit drinking for a while. I basically deicded to take a month long sabatical from all my friends to start off with. I told them I wasn't drinking and I just needed some space so don't invite me out drinking. Most of my friends are industry so a lot of them did not call or even ask about me. You learn real quick who are friends and who are drinking buddies. The few who stuck around were really supportive and asked me if I wanted to hang out in places with no drinking (the movies hiking the gym etc.) It was really lonely for a while but I was glad I wasn't out making a fool of myself and having morning panic attacks wondering what I did the night before. I ended up getting out of the industry. It's really hard to watch people drink everyday and put yourself in the industry culture where no one's gonna tell you getting wasted all the time might not be such a good idea. In February I got a day job and thought I could start drinking moderately again. I was wrong.  So here I am at day 4 again but this time endeavoring to never drink again. My advice: Lean on your girlfriend it's gonna get real lonely when most people you know drink like fish and you don't want to anymore. Go home after your shift ends-&gt;straight home. I found myself lingering after work in hopes of someone convincing me to have a drink. I am not saying don't hang out forever but give yourself a break from it for a while. Take up a hobby. Mine were so lame (knitting bullet journaling and watching all the netflix hulu and amazon prime I could) but they kept me out of the scene. This reply is getting long so I'm gonna wrap it up. Basically I had to ask myself if I could stay at my job and remain sober. I could for a while but I realized it was bringing me down. I couldn't stay sober and watch people drink day after day. After a while my resistance wore down. If you can more power to you. I hope this helps. Good luck on your journey. 
I finally realized that it wasn't *lack of willpower* as my issue but rather *Lack of In Real Life Support*.  That's all I needed!..I went to meetings and immediately found people who understood what I was experiencing.  I got tools resources support and fellowship to first stop drinking and then to live sober...Now I just forgo ONE drink today - The First One..Never been happier!
