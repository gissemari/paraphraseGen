...you grab the **one** rum-flavored chocolate from the unmarked sampler someone left out in the break room. I tasted it after I swallowed a bite. Threw the rest of it out and now I'm pissed off and sick to my stomach...I wrote to the company to find out if it's just rum flavoring or actual rum. Either way I'm not counting it as relapsing because this was not intentional...The irony is I've always detested rum-flavored candies and cakes. Yech. I'm going to be much more wary from now on...Edit: They responded quickly! No alcohol added just flavoring.

To me sobriety is about *intent*. If you didn't know then I wouldn't beat myself up about it or allow it to change your 'badge number'. .. I've had a couple similar issues. Hell my gummy fiber supplements have alcohol in them. (I really don't want to think about what would happen to my digestion if I ate enough of them to get buzzed)
