I cant get it off my mind everything reminds me of alcohol. I just want to stay sober but deep down theres a voice that says " one more night won't hurt "..Sorry guys just venting. This is my first post been lurking for a week now

find something distracting to do.  Avoid the people / places you associate with alcohol.  Good luck
You're ok. This is my first Thursday in quite a while that I'm not going to hit up 2-4-1 at my local dive bar. I'm bummed about it but it's for the best...We'll stay sober and not drink tonight together!
Why not read through [the Ulysses Bargain first](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/4cf7vy/there_is_a_proven_strategy_for_dealing_with/?ref=search_posts) and see if that makes any sense?  
Feel free to vent your feelings here - that's what we are here for! Why not get yourself a badge in the sidebar? It may not seem like much but lots of people find themselves not wanting to lose that badge of honor for continuous sobriety...The thought pattern of "one more night won't hurt" is EXACTLY why I fear relapsing most. Once I opened the door by drinking one day I feel fairly certain that mentality would kick in immediately for me and it would rapidly become YEARS. Stay strong - it gets easier!
My emergency kit includes 1. Call my sponsor 2. Call one of my band of brothers in recovery 3. Take a walk 4. Read something inspiring recovery (BB GV) 5. Call someone I might be able to help 6. Eat something 7. Relax meditate think deeply about something soothing 8. Participate in a sober group activity 9. Go to a meeting 10. Drop to my knees and pray to my HP to keep me sober that minute hour remainder of day.  If I complete all ten and still want to drink more than I want to stay sober ... who knows?  Hasn't happened yet.  Hang in there this too shall pass.  If I can do it I think just about anyone can.  Good luck and best wishes.
I have to use distraction when that happens.  I get lost in a movie or in a gripping unputdownable novel.  And I have a long glass of club soda - making sure I'm completely thirst-quenched really helps.  Coming here to SD sometimes helps too although for me it works better to get my mind focussed on non-alcohol subjects - hence the movies and the novels.
