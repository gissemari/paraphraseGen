Really looking forward to when the cold clears as I hope I start waking up clear headed!..Thank you to everyone who supported me on my first post (a whole week ago  ) and thank you to everyone else who posts on here.  ..I've found reading through other people's successes inspiring and the posts about struggles whilst I wish you weren't struggling really helps me to not feel isolated...I never thought I'd manage 7 days sober and be almost through Day 8!! ..I will not drink today!
