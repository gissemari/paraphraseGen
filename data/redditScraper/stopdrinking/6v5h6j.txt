Tonight I managed to get into the 1000lb club. In weightlifting this is if your 3 big lifts total 1000lbs or more. I've been working towards this solidly for the last few months and it marks my first major fitness goal. I wanted to post this hear because sometimes the fitness people can be a touch negative or critical and I'd struggle to cope with that now. Also I was hoping you guys would understand my dilemma now how do people celebrate without alcohol? My brain keeps telling me that I deserve a drink and one night off to celebrate is ok but I'm nearly two weeks dry and I want to stay that way.

Dude that is awesome!!! It's actually one of my goals too I'm a ways off though (my Squat is so weak)...Go buy yourself some comfort food have a nice big cheat meal get some ice cream. That'll feel like celebrating I think.
Congrats on 1000 - celebrating with alcohol will ruin your victory - nothing is made better by alcohol. Wishing you continued success with weightlifting and sobriety. I will not drink with you today.
That's amazing!  Way to go!
I've been doing the cheat meal thing (and eating ice cream) and with all the calories I'm NOT drinking I've still managed to lose a couple lbs...not drinking but celebrating with you today
As others said... this calls for an epic cheat meal!! My weapon of choice would be pizza followed by a pint of Halo Top. Or you could buy something for yourself that you've been eyeing for awhile even something simple like new workout gear! Congrats!
