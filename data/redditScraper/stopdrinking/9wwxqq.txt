I've been struggling for the last 5 years. I was diagnosed with anxiety/panic disorder then. Also was diagnosed with benign twitching syndrome at age 14. ..I tried an early recovery group aa naltrexone. Couldn't stay sober more than five days. Now thanks to my family and another dose of pancreatitis. Yes another. I am at day 10 and am finally feeling normal again. Still some night sweats but the anxiety and twitching I masked with alcohol the rebound was always worst making me drink again soon after work. ..It feels good and you are all an inspiration. Thank you all and good luck.
