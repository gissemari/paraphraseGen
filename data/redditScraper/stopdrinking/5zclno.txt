Hi guys I've been a lurker for a few months now currently on a throwaway account...I want to get my drinking under control. After high school I went to study abroad in another country. I had a chronic illness (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) that quickly caught up with me and I eventually dropped out of university here. I began drinking drinking everyday and I still continue to drink when I get too stressed out...I recently got a job offer in another city (still abroad) and I'm looking to get into a healthier lifestyle. I'm only 21 I want to get this shit sorted out...I would love to hear any advice or similar stories with your struggles. Thank you!

Do you want to moderate or quit? I didn't have any success with moderation maybe in the short term but eventually I landed right back where I was. Moving to a new city can be a great opportunity to 'reinvent' yourself (especially easy as you are young :) ) You can meet new people and simply say you 'don't drink' instead of making excuses. You can switch up your routine. I go to Refuge Recovery meetings it's good to have sober friends in my life. Best wishes!
