Embrace the suck! Cherish it for how awful it is and use the memory of it to avoid it next time. If not for the pit of regret I'd find myself in the morning after there's no question I'd still be drinking. Here's to your Day One!
I've felt the same way a few times myself :-) I think for me each time I learned something new about my alcohol dependency and I also got better "playing the tape forward" next time around which means I drank less and less over time. Hang in there we're out here rooting for you!
Keep going... have mercy on your self.
