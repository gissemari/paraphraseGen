You and me both.  What a boring damn weekend lol!  I made it through though and couldn't have been happier than I was this morning when I woke up fresh and alert.

Yeah luckily I told my wife that I'm done drinking and aside from wine I don't want anything in the house. For some reason I am not tempted by wine and she has a glass every few days. We made the agreement together that is all we have in the house and that I plan on not going over the next couple months except if they are activities where there isn't any alcohol available. Shit is tough.
Weekends are my Achilles heal I did 10days but blew it even crashed my wife's car......Stay strong you can absolutely do this!!!..IWNDTWY
