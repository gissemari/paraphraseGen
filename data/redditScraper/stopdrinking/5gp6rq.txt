So I'm coming up on 7 months not drinking and thinking about the holidays...Holidays can be hard for a lot of people in recovery since drinking is so accepted and even encouraged by some around these times.  I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a) romanticizing some of the holiday "good times" past b) thinking maybe I could indulge a little (not a recurring thought but it has crossed my mind) and c) a bit worried about my sanity and sobriety around my upcoming vacation time...So I am reminding myself why I can not drink...Last year I had 16 days off for Xmas and new years.. .In two weeks I probably spent around $500 at liquor stores and over $1000 if I include a few nights out at the bars uber food delivery junk food etc...I spent over $1000 on drunken amazon purchases... things I've since used and enjoyed (camping and computer stuff) but certainly couldn't justify or afford (credit card debt) at the time if I weren't drinking...I spent around $1000 on a 5 night Xmas vacation at a ski resort.  Originally a friend or two were going to join me (and share the cost of the hotel) but bailed on me fairly last minute probably because I was pretty unpleasant to be around most of last fall.  I wasn't too put out though because the room was non-refundable and hey this would be a chance for some "me-time". .."Me-time" turned into drinking straight vodka and high% beer pretty much nonstop for 3-4 days except for maybe 4 hours of disgustingly hungover skiing (never a good idea thankfully I didn't injure myself or others...) and fits of sleep (passing out) here and there.  ..After a spat with the hotel manager (who the hell does construction at 8am 2 days before Xmas next to an occupied room... but I really could have handled that better...) and feeling lonely I figured I'd rather forfeit my last night sober up long enough to drive home and continue my isolation bender and pity party at home...Xmas eve  I had at least a pint of vodka between noon and 7 then went to a show at a bar with a new friend and had at least another 10 shots and 4-5 beers (around $250 including a huge tip iirc).   After waking up Xmas day not remembering the last 4-6 hours of the night or how I got home (thankfully I took an uber there and got a ride from an acquaintance my new friend called for me because they were so worried about me) I realized I was pretty fucked.  ..As fucked as I was after sleeping and recovering most of xmas day I decided to keep the bender going until new years day when surely I would quit for good this time... or at least take a break for a month... or at least a week...The next 4.5 months I had a few more epic weekend benders (3-4x my normal halfpint-pint vodka a day habit) mixed with trying to quit every Monday.  The longest I made it was 5 days sober but usually not even a day or two...The day I actually had my last drink wasn't any particular bender or bottom but after years of increasingly low events and unsuccessfully trying to quit or moderate I took some time off work to get into Outpatient and get my shit together........So this year I am /not/ planning a bender /not/ planning to relapse and /not/ going to forget how hard I've fought to get to this sober place in my life...Through Outpatient /sd aa Lifering smart naked mind and other resources I've learned a lot of tools and I never want to go back to the dark place that was 2015...Hope you all stay strong and have a good holiday this year... I will not drink with you..

Great job!  I like this.  I'm going to remind myself why I'm not drinking this holiday season too because it's flitted through my head a couple of times.  It's expensive and I now own a house that I need to keep saving emergency money for.  No room in the budget (literally) for booze.  I'm in an emotionally tough time with my GF - booze would make me vulnerable to her bad emotional patterns as well as muddy up my ability to think clearly about our interactions.  I would just get frustrated depressed and inarticulate not to mention blow things out of proportion.  It would last for about 10 minutes to 2 hours of good times followed by being really disappointed in myself for months.   I love my 500+ days of sobriety!  It's guaranteed to not taste as good as I think it will. I will "break the seal" of continuous sobriety since I decided to quit and I'm scared that I won't be able to recommit as quickly or as easily as I did.  I've heard so many bad stories on here of relapses.  I absolutely cannot afford a DUI or to hurt others and I make bad driving decisions when I drink.  I would rather work out my stress in the gym or running than very temporarily put off dealing with hard shit gain weight and feel toxic.  And lastly I WANT to grow up and handle my emotions and situations like a grown-ass woman!!  I deserve a good sober fun life...Thanks for giving me the opportunity to go through this exercise.  It's already made a difference in how I'm feeling...Keep it going HBJ!  You're giving others inspiration!!
