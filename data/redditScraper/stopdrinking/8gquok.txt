Hey sober family!..Does anyone else use role plays to prepare for scenarios where you might find it difficult to explain you're not drinking? It works for me and I thought I would share...It works like this: you are meeting up with some of the 'back in the day' crew. You know they are likely to expect the old you to turn out for 'fun'. What do you do?..I get someone on mission to run through the scenario with me and develop some good lines to use when the time comes. It really eases my anxiety!..Bonus material: lines which I have tested in the field!..- 'I am just trying to lose a bit of weight'.- 'Yeah we're saving at the moment'.- 'On a diet'.- 'Nah I'm alright with soda'.- 'Don't let me stop you!'..Love light and peace! IWNDWYT!

Sure do! I don't ever like to "wing it" in situations where the temptation exists. I'd rather use my *best thinking* to come up with a plan beforehand because when I get anxious my best thinking isn't always in reach...IWNDWYT
Haha I always think about what im going to say depending on who I'm goong to hang out with. Although now I have a surgery on my ankle scheduled in a few weeks and my blood pressure is a little high so its "Wish I could but the doc said to not drink to get the blood pressure down beforehand." ..To be honest though after my ankle is healed Im really not going to play that game anymore. I dont want to drink. Thats it. I dont need an excuse. So from then on when im offered booze will simply be "Nope Im good with water thanks." 
haha Love it...[High Five](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg)
Maybe it's just me but I don't really care and just say 'I'm trying to quit drinking' or whatever.  If you beat around the bush people might not take it seriously and try to badger you into having a drink.  I'd rather just me it extremely clear that booze is not in my plans. 
I never role play and prefer to wing it.  I especially hate roll playing formally in groups at work.   Whatever works for you is a winning strategy. IWNDWYT
When I drink I want to smoke and I don't want to start smoking again.
