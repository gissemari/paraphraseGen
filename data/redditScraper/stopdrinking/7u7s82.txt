It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Wednesday everybody!](https://i.imgur.com/QLFjK9Q.gifv) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** I recently found out that I don't have to get a root canal after all. With the surgery on my foot that I also found out I don't have to get that's two bullets I've dodged. (Not to mention the money I've saved the pain I've avoided and the time off work that I don't have to take.)..**Struggle:** I have sensitivity in my mouth that gets so bad sometimes even room-temperature water can hurt. My dentist thinks it's neurological...**General:** Lying through your teeth does not count as flossing..
----------immediate responses--------

Checking in today for the first time in a while. I hd a full-on relapse in every single way possible again and my whole life has gone to shit as a result. But I'm here and I'm trying again :) ..I will not drink with you today 
**T:** Passed my first exam of the semester!..**S:** Getting my house together.  My daughter is refusing to clean her room and the front room.  No TV until those are completed.  It's been a little tense around here...**G:** Super eclipse blue moon!  One thing that's kept me sober is knowing how difficult it was to get sober and knowing that if I do relapse I may never get sober again.  It was a super eclipse blue moon type of thing for me to even go ONE day without alcohol...**Note:**  MS can manifest in different ways.  The mouth pain could be something related to that.  I hope your good luck in the health department continues!
Triumph: I guess I haven't a lot to feel triumphant about today but let's be positive - I'm still alive. And I don't have a hangover. ..Struggle: I can't stop fucking drinking. Every time I stop I start again and I hate myself for it...General: It's a beautiful sunny day where I am :).
**Triumph**: I passed the first technical round for a dream job/company!! Next interview Friday. Fingers crossed. Also I just completed a 30 day daily exercise meditation and journaling challenge with no skipped days in addition to staying sober all month. Feeling the positive momentum. ..**Struggle**: Terrible neck pain has returned despite spending over 10k on something I thought would work last year. Huge disappointment. Have new potential solutions I am going to try out next but it is hard to accept that I could live like this forever and I am not even that old. I have probably spent 60k on trying to get a grip on this pain over the last decade...**General**: Congrats to all of us New Years people!! 
38th day!
Triumph: I am buying new headphones today! Grado SR125e for home and a pair of over ear closed back Sennheiser jobbies for out and about...Struggle: I have a nasty cold. Is it possible to die from sneezing?..General: Thank goodness for antibiotic anaesthetic throat lozenges. ..I will not drink with you today!
Triumph: I'm expecting a job offer after months of searching. Negotiations have gone well..Challenge: had a lapse Monday night after 3 weeks of no drinking. Disappointed in myself but gonna get right back up on the wagon..General: just trying to stay in the present moment.
Hump daaaayeee...Triumph: Almost finishing training for tutoring. Hopefully will have more income soon. Also very much enjoying planning my wedding! ..Struggle: I've been sleeping for about 14 hours a day because my job won't start until after school and I've lost all sense of discipline. That and every night I've wanted to drink (particularly because I don't have an early AM job anymore). This routine is bringing me down. A lot...General: The Last Airbender is an incredible series. Just re-watched the whole series recently and ended with Sozin's Comet tonight. So beautiful. So epic. So worth watching multiple times! 
T: my urges are down for the most part. I stopped drinking &gt;12 a night which is a big deal for me...S: still have a hard time resisting the 1-4 drinks a night..G: wish I came to this sub more for help. I know it's helpful that's why I'm never here and wish I had someone to tell me to come here.  You guys are great I read this every day I still struggle though. I'll take tips if anyone in my same situation has any. ..Ps. I'm someone who doesn't want to stop and doesn't see it as a possibility. Anyone else feel like this that could give me some encouragement? I tried a few months ago but I'm having a hard time coming back. Wish I could though. Thank you for your daily support.
T - day 12 up early walking the dog in the drizzling rain was very peaceful and no hangover.       .S - my husband and my son arguing. I hate it and think my husband is in the wrong but he won't listen to me due to being a  drunk  mother.G - trying to decide whether to go back to AA meetings.. it's been about 9 months am not a great fan

triumph: I'm not feeling stressed about money like I am normally because I don't have this constant drain on my resources to fund 'fun'. now I have fun and it costs barely anything. who knew. .struggle: I've never been a soft drink/soda person but have been smashing them to compensate. trying to go sugar free when I can but sometimes when I'm out it's not an option. that coupled with less time to gym this week means I'm feeling a bit out of shape and not getting any of the weight loss I was quietly expecting. it's fine I'm still healthier than I was! so here's hoping that's just around the corner..general: can't wait to see this supermoon hey!
I don't really have any triumphs moments I am pretty excited that my father and I starting playing Civ 5 together again! I'm happy I can actually focus on it and not get bored and want to walk away...I'm struggling with my drunk dreams lately. The past three nights I've woken up in a cold sweat pissed that I had drank before I realize it was just a dream...Generally I'm feeling pretty alright with my sobriety. I will not be drinking with you today! Thanks all!
**Triumph:** I was offered and accepted a new job that I start this upcoming Monday! I went back to school this semester to get a second degree in education and I will now be working in a school. So excited!..**Struggle:** Being able to tell my girlfriend my true relationship with alcohol. That I need to give it up for good. I've always had trouble talking about my emotions but I plan to on Thursday when we both finally have a non hectic day. ..**General:** I am in week 3 of my current half marathon training cycle. Had an awesome track workout yesterday and am so grateful that I have been able to ramp up weekly mileage sans hangovers. 
**Triumph** Been to the gym 6 of the last 7 days and taught an aerobics class last week for the first time in 6 years! I taught this class still struggling to recover from my last drinking bout and having not drank the whole weekend before rather than practicing and it was still pretty good so I'm very excited about how the next one's going to go tonight since I've been sober and actually practicing. ..**Struggle** I'm sick of the Minnesota winter for one thing. I miss being outdoors for more than 5 minutes without feeling frostbite setting in! There are other struggles but I'm going with this more lighthearted one for today. :)..**General** Looking forward to hitting double digit sober days in a few days here. Grateful for you all for being here to help me.
Triumph: my landlord and real estate renewed our lease for 12 months plus continuance ad infinitum today. For the first time in my entire life [or at least the 46 years I have been old enough to make conscious memories] I have a long-term home that is safe nice functional affordable and secure. being sober means being able to take care of it and keep affording it..Struggle: no matter how many concentrated hours I put in each day/evening I am STILL behind on work for too many gigs. Maybe I have too many gigs.....General: The grapes are ripening on the enormous vine that covers the arbour on our back porch and beyond. Kiddo loving grazing them when she spots some ripe ones and I love watching the little silvereye wrens ducking in and out - they stick their beaks into a grape and suck the juice out and peep away to each other as they flutter and hop about looking for the next treat.
Wednesday February 7th 2018 u/sfgirlmary...The Big One! Can't wait to party with you!!! ;)..**Triumph:**    I'm forcing myself to go to lunch with a girl friend today. I haven't seen her in *months* mostly because I moved upstate. Why a triumph? Because I've been sick then hibernating and just so comfy with my winter coziness that I really do need social interaction outside of me and K's families...**Struggle:**    See above. I'm trying to break out of hibernation mode. Spring better *hurry the F up*!!! ;)..**General:**     It's SO's birthday this weekend and I'm hosting a big family party at the house. Cooking baking decorating cleaning like a maniac (yup OCD-style) and I'm loving every minute of it! I *LOVE* entertaining. And come on who doesn't love Carvel ice cream cake?! I'll be sure to send all my SD peeps a big slice to celebrate! &lt;3
**Triumph:** I ve been feeling the urge for a slip coming on for a week but after telling it to a friend the pressure lifted. How about that. Thanks friend...**Struggle:** A difficult work and health and economic situation is weighing me down. Just have to take one day at a time there too...**General:** If you always do what you always did you ll always get what you always got.
I will not drink today.
&gt;Lying through your teeth does not count as flossing..Oh.....that's *Golden*!   Definitely a Keeper !!
**Triumph:** Coffee and eclipse. Skies cleared in time. Now I'm lounging and watching the moon disappear...**Struggle:** Can't get rid of this cold. I feel better for a few days and then cycle down. Physically drained shitty sleep and dry congestion leaves me struggling to keep on top of everything. But I'm alive have a home and medicine and glorious coffee...**General:** "We don't see things as they are we see them as we are." Anais Nin
Triumph:  tomorrow will be double-digits on this stretch!..Struggle:  pending divorce - it was probably always a "when" question &amp; ex to be is arguably emotionally abusive so probably good thing in long run but my drinking certainly didn't help me in dealing w/her.....General:  having to relearn who I am after 22 yrs in a dysfunctional marriage &amp; slowly getting sober.  I always thought statements like that ("finding yourself") were Oprah BS but like so many things you don't realize how real it is until you experience it firsthand...
Triumph: I got myself a yoga workout dvd before going on vacation with the intent of starting it when I got back. And now that I am back I've actually stuck to it! My muscles are not used to this but it also kind of feels good...Struggle: The company I've worked at for the last 16 years is being sold or merged or something. It was fresh off the presses news this morning and I'm having anxiety over what's going to happen. I'm just hoping there's still a place for me when the dust settles. ..General: I got a short glimpse of the start of the eclipse on my drive in this morning so that was cool.
Triumph: I'm working out again and eating clean.  It's so much easier without my wine brain saying  go ahead eat the whole sleeve of thin mints ..Struggle: I'm journaling for the first time I my life. It's dredging up some painful memories but helps me see why I was so broken in the first place. My best friend is helping me process it all. I can't confide in my husband because he hates this person who put me through shit growing up and it's just fuel for his hatred fire. I don't hate the person. I'm indifferent to them now. My best friend understands. ..General: It's hecking cold here. I wish it were spring already. ..Not drinking with you fine people today. 
Triumph:  Have overcome some of the challenges of aging and are again on a extended roadtrip to scenes of [wonder and beauty](https://i.imgur.com/ZqjDQRC.jpg)..Struggle: acceptance of physical limitations ..General:[have to clean my camera's sensor](https://i.imgur.com/kRbbXle.jpg)
**Triumph:** The little projects that have been accumulating for some time around my house are finally starting to get accomplished!  Loose door hinge attic insulation window privacy screen..  Just a number of small things that "I can get to tomorrow" finally started getting done...**Struggle:** I'm continuing to find myself dehydrated.  My nights are filled with better sleep and I'm staying active through the evenings.  But I still have trouble getting enough water throughout the day.  I need to start using my hydro coach app again to remind me to drink water...**General:** It's the last day of January.  2018 is 1/12th over already.  I'll blink and it'll be my birthday in February soon.  Looking forward to future birthdays and life to see what comes!
** Triumph:** Made it through the weekend with my daily drinker dad staying with us.  Big trigger for me historically. ..**Struggle** My SO isn't being as supportive of me in sobriety as I had hoped. ..**General:** I am excited to go watch the full moon rise tonight and hopefully get a decent photo of it.  Amazing how night time activities are no longer off the table because I won't be able to drive!
Triumph: good counseling last night. Working on moving back in with my wife. Struggle: trying to be more mindful because I am having a hard time expressing my feelings and learning to be vulnerable. General: I learned that antelope tastes a lot like lamb first hand.
**Triumph:** I started sending harder routes in my climbing gym this past week! Progress is nice...**Struggle:** Insurance is a pain in the rear. I think I've found a therapy solution that works for me but I don't have my appointment for another month. I need to find a local physician too. I haven't gotten a general physical in over a year.  ..**General:** Your 'general' reminds me that I need to floss tonight. Thanks u/sfgirlmary!
Triumph: Got 100s on all my first two week assignments! FFF yes. Front row seater in class now instead of hungover girl in the back with a hat on who shows up only for the exams..Struggle: Hate to admit this. I really do. But I constantly have to stop myself from doing small amoral things that I used to do without a second thought (lying about stupid shit not stealing something from a grocery store cheating on an assignment). This was a major factor in my alcoholism so I am doing my best to correct these behaviors. But when I stop and think about it it's like woah I had become such a terrible person. At least I'm working on it now...General:
Triumph: Nothing crazy just going through day to day I am here no embarrassing stories no hangovers. .Struggle: LAUNDRY and staying focused at work..General:  Happy Happy Joy Joy.  
Triumph: went to two AA meetings yesterday ..Struggle: a lot haha. Im still worried about a dui case that I cant put behind me yet. ..Im worried since life sucks itll never be fun agian since i cant drink. ..I have to go back to my college campus to collect the rest of my stuff and i really dont want anyone to see me. Plus i have to meet with someone to decide where to go from here..General : im not really sure
For now I just want to say I won't be drinking today.
Good morning lovely!  Was your final statement any sort of political remark?! I had a pretty good week until yesterday so.....**Triumph:** I began a "conversation" with a non-profit organization a few states away (but in the same state my son currently lives) about their need for a new Executive Director.  While I'm not sure if it's the right fit for me (or them) yet hopefully they'll fly me there in a couple of weeks to talk more and feel into it.  The triumph part is having put myself out there in a big way and actually being (mostly) willing to take the leap if the opportunity truly seems right...**Struggle:** My job.  I love my department. I supervise 16 people who are all fabulous and totally committed to being in service to their clients who are significantly economically disadvantaged with all the other ripples that creates in health mental health social needs etc. We are awesome!  But the organization itself...is f*cked. One level down from the officers and I have no autonomy no decision-making very little control and have a CEO who micromanages shit he knows nothing about.  Yesterday was a bad day and was a great reminder why I applied for said position above...**General:** Twenty beautiful miles in the mountains hiked over the weekend.  Had a hip that was bothering me last week so I bit the bullet and bought new hiking shoes -- walah! no pain.  There are bigger mountains in the state I might move to...that's really exciting.
Triumph: Sobriety is allowing me to face some realities of aging head-on instead of pretending I'm 28 and can participate in the "Interval Blast" class at the fitness center. It's freeing..Struggle: Delaying the effects of aging takes a lot of time..General: The book I am reading has me smiling and sometimes laughing out loud in the privacy of my own living room.
T: Had a breakthrough on Work project. ...S: I've been really inconsistent with my eating habits. I've been running and that is going great I love it but I have lost zero weight because I eat too fucking much. I will count calories one day and say fuck it the next. Yesterday I had McDonalds for lunch and generally ate like shit. I had dessert like three fucking times.  I'm just frustrated with myself. I don't really gain. I go up and down every week but am basically where I was last April. I just want to lose my beer gut and get down to my ideal weight. I've made zero progress even with running. Fuck. (Should have saved this for the Friday rant I guess sorry!  Lol)
**T:** I realized I wasn't focusing as well as I should have on the work I have to do so I booked a quiet room at the office to do my work.  My co-workers are great but man they talk a lot. ..**S:** I've realized that the security camera we have pointing out the front of my house is not good for my mental health. I don't get along well with my next-neighbor and we have entered into an escalating cycle of retaliation and the fact that I can see what he's doing in the front of his house makes me anxious.  We have the camera for legit non-spying security reasons - my kids have have started coming home  from school by themselves and letting themselves into the house while my SO and I are at work. We got the camera to keep tabs on them and make sure they are ok. That it records all other activity is unnerving to me. ..**G:** IDK man just trying to make it through the day. I downloaded a bunch of mediation apps to my phone and I'm hoping they help. 
Triumph: I am sober..Struggle: This is the most depressed I have been since I joined SD. This might be a super long day. I hope and pray I can resist drinking tonight..General: I just don't have anything for this...I will not drink with you today.
Triumph: I am 50 days sober. I am starting to get a grip on a real life...Struggle: I have been having headaches and just generally feeling shitty for the past week or so. I'm worrying it's my caffeine intake (even though I only have about 2-3 cups of black tea a day). So hopefully switching to decaf will make things easier. ..General: Aw crap I'm running late for work again.
Triumph: I went out last night and finally tried  yoga for the first time sober and loved it! I cant wait for my next yoga class tomorrow....Struggle: I think my partner still doesnt trust me and we are still at a bit of a rocky point in our relationship but hell i cant blame him...General: Going out to a drum circle tonight!
Feeling those winter/work blues but IWNDWYT!
I'm here and sober. I won't drink with you today! 
Triumph: I finished transcribing the book I wrote on legal pads! And I ran 2.5 miles yesterday even though I was tired...Struggle: A stray bunny is living in my yard. A pet bunny. I named her Assata and I've gotten attached but she's thwarted 6 attempts to catch her and take her to a vet. Outsmarted traps... chewed my net... I worry about her! The most I can do is give her lots of veggies..
T: I'm starting to notice a healthier body and slimmer face. Recognizing myself...S: I can't let this progress ease my discipline or the trend will reverse. I know I often see results and say "hey I've done well I deserve *X*"..G: Sleep has been a mixed bag. I've been using guided meditation the last few nights and it seems to help! Hoping to get back to a more regular sleep schedule in the near future...IWNDWYT
**Triumph:** Being asked to write an article on my industry for a small business magazine...**Struggle:** Trying to fit everything in!..**General:** I went to see an Elbow tribute band called Arse last weekend. They were so good I could hardly tell them apart...
Triumph:  Some much needed business has come thru and hopefully the payoff will follow soon!..Struggle:  Repercussions of 10 years of alcohol abuse.  Lots of work to do to try and make things better...General:  While I am not a fitness/health fanatic at all I enjoy exercise and movement.  I also enjoy cooking and finding different things to make for my family.  I can't bake though! 
triumph: continue to feeling. on day 11 of meditation..struggle: work will always be stressful. i am anxious and doing my best to appreciate that i do what i can with my best efforts...general: concerned for a friend at the moment. prayers greatly appreciated. 
T: it's Wednesday &amp; another day sober.  .S: today is my 30-day mark yet I look forward with dread not backward with satisfaction. .G: sun is finally out.  That helps the mood a lot.  Got plenty to keep me busy today.  
Hello SD. Thank you for being here! I've been leaning on this sub hard .recently. ..**Triumph:** This is the last day of January and I am still working diligently on all my personal goals. Still sober eating clean/working out(lifting) and working on my business even though all these things have been challenging....go me!.**Struggle:**I am not happy about any of it. Bummed out the last few weeks. I think I experienced the proverbial pink cloud and it is A Long Gone. Feel lately like Charlie Brown with a small thunder cloud following me. Thinking lately I might have an actual mental condition that has not been diagnosed which would explain a lot..**General:**I keep trucking. Trying not to let the sound of my own wheels make me crazy(ier).
**T:** started a new/added set of responsibilities at work yesterday and everything went great.  A few months ago I would have been a stressed mess counting down the minutes to when I could get out of there and start downing beer...**S:** Even though my SO has been cutting back on her party lifestyle I still get stressed and have restless sleep when she does go out.  ..**G:** only saw the moon from inside (getting over a cold) but it was still pretty amazing..
T: Exponential growth in fitness and flexibility since becoming sober!.S: Taking it one day at a time. .G: Saw the   eclipse earlier! 
T: .Had a really good Monday and Tuesday. Got some things I had been wanting to do finished. Ironically made a decision to get off of using reddit so much ;).S: .Today sucks at work. Nothing to do except my own little experiments that aren't productive really just keep me busy and I hate not having meaningful things to do..G:.I don't know I've had a lot of ups and downs but have no plans to go back to my bad habits. 
Triumph: First month of 2018 was the best first month of a year I've ever had. I feel like I've figured out a great mix of therapy medication exercise and spirituality it'll always be growing and changeable but wow. It's been so encouraging. Things can go up and up. Not always down and down. ..Struggle: Somehow my gym didn't charge my credit card last year and I didn't notice either so now I'll have to pay that whole chunk. Its fine but kinda sucks to see that money go all at once. ..General: My teeth have been extra sensitive lately as well. I think I'm grinding them more and I dont know why. ..
T: In just 11 short hours I'll be 60 days alcohol free. This is now way surpassing the amount PR that I've been sober since I've started drinking. I'm feeling good! Cravings of the last week have subsided .S: Romanticizing my drinking.G: Going to order some wings for dinner tonight and watch my favorite show because why not :). I don't need reasons for everything like I needed for my drinking 
Checking in by posting for for the first time in this sub...Triumph: I stopped drinking over a month ago thanks in large part to finding this sub. My puffy eyes are gone I've lost over 15 lbs cleaned and re-arranged 80% of my house and finally left the soul-sucking job that helped push my drinking over the edge.  ..Struggle: Still a ways to go but I feel a lot better even though I know my health has gone downhill. You can only be a functional alcoholic for so long.  I'm so tired but no longer suicidal. Just struggling to get motivated and find my life force again...General:  Also I put in for a badge here when I stopped drinking and wanted to take a look at it. The people here are wonderful. Thank you for being real and inspiring!
T: I went to the gym 3 times in 7 days! It was a good balance of weights cardio and yoga. I've had a serious issue with fitness becoming an obsession instead of an attribute in the past...I exercised for the wrong reasons. To me the reason to exercise is that it's good for you. Weight lose is great but if I focus on that alone i have a tendency to not enjoy it and beat myself up if it doesn't  move quickly enough. Once I stopped working out so much I became obsessed with drinking. ..S: I have around 50# to lose due to drinking 3-5 days/week for 5 years...G: it's pretty out today!..Iwndwyt
**Triumph:**  Successfully fought off a depressive episode yesterday after my fun friends headed home leaving me with some self-defeating thoughts.  Got my butt to the gym and I swear I could feel the endorphins enter my bloodstream!  ..**Struggle:**  Staying focused on being proactive instead of reactive when it comes to living my life.  I. CAN. DO. THIS...**General:**  Already looking forward to my first real garden in my backyard this spring.  I'm so used to a big garden in the community garden I was a part of for 6 years.  Now I have a little raised bed and lots of plans to do more and turn my little postage stamp of a backyard into an oasis!  Just need to fight off the squirrels...
I will not drink all day Wednesday 
Glad to be here today. Things would probably be very different if I was still floating in the bottle..Triumph: I've posted in SD consistently since I found it. I am a lurker by nature and tend to wait for someone else to post what I'm thinking or just figure that my voice will get lost..Struggle: My dad fell last week. He's 89 and this was the first real indication that he's winding down. It's very hard on my mom and I've been needed to step up to begin and make decisions about their future. It sucks - a lot..General: My mantra has been "Be a better man than you were yesterday and work to be better than that tomorrow."
Triumph: I was able to take the day to help my mom out with decluttering. It is the little things that keep me sober like being able to be a reliable person and shit. ..Struggle: my feelings of worthlessness seem to be peeking their ugly ass little heads out as of late. ..General: I have been lurking for a while now and finally requested my badge! 
36 hours sober... withdrawal sucks...I'm missing a reunion tonight because the headache fever my stomach is so upset.
Triump: When I stop drinking the universe is deffinatly clear about giving me some pushes in the directions I should be going. Today I realized that I genuinely do not want to drink to wast my short time on this earth not listening. ..Struggle: I am a divorced mom of two awesome kids. This month they have both had strep and one has had the flu. I am the parent so I used my sick time and missed a lot of work. I feel spread very thin sometimes...General: I have a really awesome dog. No human could ask for a more loving and loyal friend. I could not sleep last night and it was so nice to have him next to me. He was asleep and snoring though. At least he is well rested...Hugs to all!  
Triumph: Two weeks!..Struggle:  Still feeling tempted often.  Loneliness.  Thoughts about the last few times of drinking and how mind boggling bad the outcome was...General:  Happy I am sober and where I am at the moment.
Not sure how I would have felt if I drank the 3 vodka shooters I bought But I feel damn good because I poured them out!! Day 5! IWNDWYT
Will not drink Wednesday!  I won't drink today with you!
F U alcohol. I recently joined this sub I felt I needed the support. I am a productive person - I get up early i work a lot I go to the gym I eat healthy I take classes .... but then I have one drink and everything spirals out for a few weeks. I need to break the pattern. Alcohol is ruining me - financially mentally physically. I already struggle with depression and I learned how to deal with it (by telling myself it's just a form of procrastination) and alcohol makes it harder to cope. I now feel tired  cause I drank today so I'm not productive and feel guilty and hate myself for it. I complain about not being able to travel more when I could buy a ticket to Mexico every week with the money I spend drinking. Fucking alcohol. Just ranting... fucking alcohol! 
**Triumph:**  I discovered I like drinking unsweetened cocoa with a touch of cayenne and cinnamon.  I feel like this is a nice warm comfort drink for me and it offers that feeling of sophistication I want in a beverage after a hard day.  I've been trying to nip out extra sugar and cream from my beverage consumption lately so this fits the bill...**Struggle:** I did not win the lottery.  My bank account is overdrawn due to an autopayment I didn't know was going through so soon. I had to use a gift card my son had for gas and milk today.  He was sweet about it but I felt like a loser. And my oven is broken again something is up with my well pump system and I only have water about 2/3 of the time and sometimes just a trickle.  I'm feeling really low energy and am worried I'm sick going to the doc later this week.  So yeah shit sucks.  Good thing tomorrow is Thankful Thursday and I can stop feeling stressed about these problems for a bit.  ..**General:** Your quote got me thinking about lies and I found this:  *"Never chase a lie. Let it alone and it will run itself to death."* - Lyman Beecher.   Then I looked up [Lyman Beecher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman_Beecher) and found out he was co-founder of the American Temperance Society.  Interesting..
Hi! I'm back here year after a few years of relapse.....T: Received my acceptance letter from mortuary school..S: we spend most of our time with family and they're ALWAYS drinking. Don't know how to handle that..G: the great British baking show is making me sad calories are a thing
