So I'm sitting here on the patio having a ginger beer and thinking about all the hell I have put my body through. I have a doctors appt on Thursday and hoping my blood tests will be fine. They were last year. I really am trying to put my best foot forward but still have relapses from time to time. Work is a bit stressful at the moment and my job is at risk. But all in all I am doing ok.

Enjoying a ginger beer on the patio sounds like a nice place to be. You have stress but seems like you've got a bit of prioritizing going on... problems will come and go in their own time but sometimes the right thing to do is just break open a n/a beverage and chill. So much of sobriety is learning how to deal with things in their own time I think...We're all putting our best foot forward. Let's see that relapse is something we keep behind us this time around...I'm about to join you with a ginger ale I think (too cold for the patio though.) Not going to be drinking today!
If you add all the days you didn't drink that is how much you achieved.  Yes your health can be impacted by drinking but there are loads of people that post here saying how quickly their test results improve normally in fairly quick time...Obviously it would be best if we never damaged our health in the first place but then we wouldn't be here if it was that simple...Good luck.
Thank you for the kind words. Sometimes I kinda beat myself up a little too much. Enjoy that ginger ale and I too will not be drinking today.
