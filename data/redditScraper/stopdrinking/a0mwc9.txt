The bad mood is unfortunately still with me and not improved in any way. On top of that I have been struggling with an on and off craving  for the past 3 or 4 hours I have put my pyjamas on and am cooking dinner and will be stuffing my face (again) with junk food...I'm so tired of this...IWNDWYT.

It's going to be okay. Glad you are here!! Do whatever you need to do to not drink today. Eat the junk have a nice hot bath watch some trashy movies whatever will distract you. Don't think about anything other than today. You are strong you can do it!! IWNDWYT 
Ugh I feel your pain. They say just ride it out because cravings pass. It's so frustrating when they actually last hours and hours. That's a long ride! When I have them and they don't go anywhere or get really bad I do  urge surfing  techniques to chill out. If you haven't already tried this I highly recommend googling it and giving it a go. 
Hey friend. This is my second time at day 2 and it is awe full. The rage I had last time (which peaked at day 3) was real. A couple of things that helped me last time was to carry around a water bottle so I could do my normal guzzle (but not wine!). It distracted my hands nicely. But so be good to yourself. It will get easier but it's bloody hard now. Hang in there IWNDWYT Jules.
