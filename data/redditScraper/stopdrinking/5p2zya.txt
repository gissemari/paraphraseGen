Substance Therapy.This substance therapy .Never seems to help me.Losing sleep awake in my bed.Shaking sweating it's all in.my head.The pain of staying sober is not.an easy ride.Going back to using seems easier .than having pride..My strength gets tested at unexpected times.My progress thus far reminds me of my crimes.That my substance abuse has created in my past.How long will this never ending battle last?..But let me tell you all that there is a light.Staying sober and clean with all your might.The chance of relapse is always in the back of mind.But with support from everyone hope will shine.I will not drink or use with you all tonight.
