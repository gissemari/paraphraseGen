2 years sober something I never ever thought I would achieve I struggled with two dry days previously. My whole family were so worried about me but no one even knew I reached 2 years everyone has sort of forgotten..Everything was going so well then I got dumped. Oh god I'm single 46 and have started going back  out' to pubs and clubs. .I feel so bloody inadequate and bloody lonely I really want to drink and smoke I might as well go the whole hog. This is so hard!

That is rough.  Hang in there with us.  If you are going to be dating again you are going to want to look and feel your best.
Type out your vision of your future if you start drinking again. You know you won't be able to moderate you'll be fucked.
I'm sorry to hear about your breakup; that's got to be hard. Self-destruction can call loudly during times like this. But it's not gonna get you anywhere. When I've given in during a low point I wake up with all the problems I had the night before plus a hangover and some extra shame over f\*cking up on my sobriety goals. You've got this. If you can do two years you can handle tonight; that's all you have to worry about. Tomorrow you can worry about tomorrow. ..IWNDWYT.

Broke up with girlfriend of a year and a half it hurts so bad but it was the right decision. Drinking will only further isolate me. Instead I'm going to focus on all the things I didn't have time to do while in the relationship like focus on working out reading planning an international trip. We got this it's hard but drinking will only make it harder.
