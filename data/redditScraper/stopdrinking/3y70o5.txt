265 days without getting drunk at all. not a drop. did y'all know not long ago i didn't think that was a thing i would be able to do?..let's talk about families the kind we usually only see on days like today (for all my Christmas SDers.) for the most part i think most longer time sober individuals' families are aware that we no longer drink. for whatever reason it's different for all of us. i find that everyone in my family is aware and i never told anyone. word just kind of got out and sporadically throughout the year i would get a "hey i want you to know i'm real proud of you and everything you're doing...." from a family member -- and sort of have to decipher what they meant. i appreciated it but it caught me off guard. i was never fishing for these remarks. another family member with whom i was helping with some contracted work for his job turned to me out of nowhere once while we were working and told me "you know you've really inspired me to cut back on the booze but after all this hard work i think i'm gonna have a cold one tonight!" i *never* told him i quit drinking or even discussed drinking with him. i smiled awkwardly and accepted the compliment. other friends i don't see normally who are home for the holidays will inevitably bring it up cautiously. ."you look great man! so you still uh... doing the not drinking thing?" ."Yep." .that's it. i don't need to hop on a soap box or wax poetic about the struggle. if they want to get into it i will but i don't see it as a big deal. or rather: just because my sobriety is a big deal for me i don't feel the need to walk into a room and make it a big deal for everyone else. i don't make a display of declining drinks. i don't get into it every time a family member says something decidedly stupid or uninformed about addiction. i'm good. moving on...speaking of which- last night at a christmas eve party a family member brought up and got to discussing Jeff Allison the Texas MLB first round draft pick from 2003 who apparently got addicted to heroin and threw his career away only later to become something of a comeback story. i'd never heard of him. while discussing him someone made a point a point that they seemed to be quite impressed with that Allison never allows himself to be out and about on his own with more than $15 dollars on him at any given time and won't carry a credit card. Allison says he does this because he wants to ensure he never relapses. or at least; thats what my family member was saying... who knows if it's true. but my family member thought it was very admirable that Allison would go through these lengths to stay sober and seemed very impressed with him. i had different feelings. if after years sober i couldn't even trust myself to walk down the street with loose cash for fear of a momentary lapse in judgement i dare say my recovery isn't going very well. now don't get me wrong-- it's smart to be preemptive and avoid temptation no matter how much time you have-- but if i find myself teetering on the brink of a relapse like that and after years i trust myself *that* little? i don't know. sounds miserable...here's my point-- i didn't get into it last night. i didn't feel the need to. i find my goal for days like today is to just get by be polite and convivial and try to enjoy myself as best i can. sometimes early on when you aren't drinking it seems like everyone is scrutinizing you. as time goes on i find that isn't the case. i recommend to everyone just starting out- try to make the holidays go by as *smooth* as possible. people only know what you tell them. have a safe one all...
