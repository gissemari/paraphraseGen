I'm sorry you're struggling. Unfortunately none of us here are trained to help in a situation where a person might feel suicidal. Please reach out to  r/suicidewatch or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.
Please don't do this! Call the suicide hotline. There is an answer for everything. It can be hard but there is so much goodness in the world it can get better than you can even imagine.
