I've cooked with wine in the past with no problem but the other day I had to cook with bourbon. When I smelled that bottle the plastic unlabeled squeeze bottles that litter the line it about sent me to the floor. I wasn't prepared for this but I just keep thinking about it. None of my chefs can give me any advice here I hope there are some sober chefs on here that have found a way to cook with booze and not struggle to drink.

Pragmatically speaking Cook's Vanilla makes a bourbon extract. I've used the rum extract version before for holiday desserts and it can work. That said bourbon and rum were not my drink of choice. I have no issues drinking non alcoholic beer so I just get a six pack of that if I need beer for a recipe or if someone else cooked with real beer it doesn't bother me. But wine? Even non alcoholic wine awakens the beast in me. I have to be really honest with myself and say that wine-heavy dishes need to be off the table for me.
