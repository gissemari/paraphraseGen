I was able to do some neglected tasks over the weekend instead of drinking to avoid them.  My house requires an overwhelming amount of work that will take months to chisel away at.  It's like looking up at Mount Everest.  One of the reasons I drank so much was to avoid this fact.  So over the weekend I didn't drink and I faced it without stirring up mental struggles.  I said to myself "I've got to deal with this and I'm not going to overthink it throw up my hands and crack open a drink."  So I got some things done.  There was still time later on to relax.

I used to think that if I drank it would give me the motivation to do household tasks. Except that I would work for 5 minutes then sneak drinks and fuck around on the phone for 55 minutes. So dumb. So glad I don't have to deal with that stupid shit anymore. Drinking only ever added two extra tasks plus the first task that still never got done.
Good job!  When you're done wanna come work on mine?  :)..Keep up the good work!
I'm right there with you... many years of letting stuff go but it's actually been a really great distraction these past few weekends.
Not drinking one day at a time. Doing the house one task at a time. You got this...I'm not drinking with you today
Awesome work you rock !!!!..Congrats on 6 7 days....yeah its taken a little while to work on my house too. Your right on about not over-thinking the issue. I would treat myself to an ice cream sundae or banana split or something when I was able to get something done on my house that didn't involve drinking...Keep it up:)
