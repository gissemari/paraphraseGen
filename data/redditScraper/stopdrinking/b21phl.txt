Just thought I would vent here and say that today I fought the urge to drive myself to the store and pickup wine. This was odd to me because usually if the thought crosses my mind I snap out of it by remembering that I'm not that person anymore. I remember that I'm 100 times better where I am now than I ever was when I was drinking.  But today I didn't care for a little too long. I really tried to convince myself in my head that it would just be one time (which really scared me) .I fear relapse more than anything. ..I'm currently having trouble coping with some stuff I'm going through and the thought of shutting out my thoughts with alcohol really tempted me. Sure it would be great to forget but I know myself too well. One time would turn into the destructive cycle that was my life over 10 months ago. The thought of going back to that gives me anxiety but I can't help but think  what if . What if the sober life really isn't for me? ..I guess I'm not just venting but also fishing for words of encouragement or any advice. I don't have friends I can confide in to talk to about this nor a therapist or really anyone at all. I feel pretty alone and vulnerable. This really freaking sucks
