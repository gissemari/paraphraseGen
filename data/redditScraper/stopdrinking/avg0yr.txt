Struggling like many others here. I have been in and out of sobriety for years. I always tell myself I can go to a bar and hang without drinking. Impossible for me. Celebrating 1 month here but I'm certain I'll slip up at social events. Bummer but true. Hopefully some others can relate. Careful out there at social events folks. Obviously my journey is different than everybody else's. No judgement. Just saying where my problem lies. Homebody these days.

I hear this. Deciding not to drink doesn't remove alcohol or the cravings from our lives.
I had to change a whole lot of my habits in order to stay sober but it has been absolutely worth it. Someone once said here "you are your current actions" and that really stuck with me. I spent a lot of time asking "Is this something sober me does or something drinking me does"? The answers were surprising sometimes!
