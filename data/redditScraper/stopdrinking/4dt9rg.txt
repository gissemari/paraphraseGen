Hey peeps..Just thought I'd share the dream I had in a few incarnations last night that felt so unbelievably real.....I dreamt that I decided going nearly 11 months without booze meant that I could take it or leave it so had a few glasses of wine with a friend. I also decided to smoke a pack of cigarettes for some unknown reason. ..There was no major event that sparked it. Just made the decision. I didn't feel out of control and it felt like a well thought out great idea at the time. ..Then (still part of the dream) I woke up the next day thinking it had been a dream that I couldn't have relapsed that I didn't have to reset my badge. But then I found the empty pack of cigarettes and realised it had all been for real. ..The feelings were excruciating. I was so upset I couldn't believe what I'd done. My brain already started thinking "I could get away with this if I didn't tell anyone" "nothing bad happened and I'm already drinking might as well just keep it going" and other dangerous thoughts. ..I actually had this dream about 4 times last night and when I actually woke up a few minutes ago I needed to properly piece together last night to make sure that I knew what was real. ..I'm pleased to say that I didn't drink and am still going. That felt so real though my strength is totally resolved!..

Good work on this my friend.  I was just exchanging emails with another dream researcher this week.  I sent him the [What do Drinking Dreams Mean? post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2dit1m/what_do_drinking_dreams_mean/?ref=search_posts) I expect he's going to add to our knowledge base on these dreams.
I had one where I was dreaming that I woke up from a dream and was telling someone about it. It's completely disorienting. I try to think of it like a tool where what I make of it is more important than what it was. And at least it's always a relief to wake up. :)
Good grief! That could be very upsetting.
Ugh! That sounds like a nightmare! I hope you were able to shake it off. I had a dream last night that my cat could ride a bike. She took it out and lost it naughty cat!!
Holy crap that's one super crazy relapse dream!!!  Waking up IN YOUR DREAM....omg!  When will these dreams be a thing of the past for us? I still get them but they're less powerful now.
