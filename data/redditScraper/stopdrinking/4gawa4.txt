As the title reads I told my wife today that I am planning on going to SMART on Tuesday night. She looked completely shocked..."Your an alcoholic?!?!". She said "You don't look like an alcoholic" and I told her what my definition of an alcoholic was. I told her that an alcoholic is someone who is powerless over alcohol and they can't stop after just 1 drink. She seemed to understand. We had good talk about it and I think I have her support. ..I still can't believe that she didn't know! I must have done a good job hiding the bottles. Not something to be proud of really. ..So I'm looking forward to my first SMART meeting next week. I'm hoping to meet some new people and maybe make some friends. If not that's alright but at least I'll get a chance to talk about my addiction and learn from people who share the same struggle as I do...Thanks for reading and have a great day!

Good luck. Be interested to hear how you like it.
Best of luck at the meeting! I hope you meet supportive people and learn a lot! ..As an aside I'm not even slightly surprised that your wife was unaware. Alcoholics are MASTERS at lying to cover up (protect) their drinking. Almost no one in my life knew the extent of my drinking. Those that did were those who drank exactly like I did!
Can I ask you how much you drink?..I am starting to wonder if I'm going in the same direction that's why I ask.
Good luck! I was definitely a master of hiding bottles...  I hope the meeting helps you build a support network.
congrats first step is the hardest
Hiding the bottles was the trickiest part for me. I had clever hiding spots and my wife would find them every time. I finally gave up hiding them when I came downstairs and she had all my empties lined up on the kitchen counter.
