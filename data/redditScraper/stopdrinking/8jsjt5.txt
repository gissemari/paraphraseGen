I hit rock bottom a year ago. I was struggling with depression after a traumatic experience and turned to drinking to escape the pain. I had just turned 21 and the newly available alcohol was the easiest way to shut down my mind. I had dropped out of college and spent whatever time I had either sleeping drinking recovering from hangovers or lying in the dark as I contemplated leaving the house to buy more liquor. ..Rock bottom for me was my second suicide attempt. That was when I realized it was time to ask for help. With the help of my family I checked myself into a hospital hours after. The next month was a whirlwind. After weeks in a psych ward and two more weeks in rehab I returned to normal life a changed person. ..My past year had its ups and downs- there were certainly many times that I wanted to reach for a bottle to make things feel better (even for just a minute). But I knew that the temporary feeling of relief was not the answer and that if I stuck out the pain I would emerge a little bit stronger than i was before. ..I'm 22 now and a year sober. I can easily say that I am the happiest I've been in a really long time. Its kind of a weird thing to say (and I'll never say it to anyone out loud) but I used to chase one drink with another for that warm feeling inside my tummy but now I can find it by just thinking about all the love I have for myself. ..It took me so long to get to this point in my life but I'm so happy to be here. I'm so happy and proud and quite frankly shocked that I made it a year...At this point I'm rambling but I want to thank this community. I've been a silent reader for a long time but this has been my anchor for the past year. For the past year I have felt your positivity joy pride frustration and sadness. I have celebrated your milestones and have white-knuckled it through your lows. Thank you for sharing your stories and letting me know that I am not alone...Thank you for everything you guys.
