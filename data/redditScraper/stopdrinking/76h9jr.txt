Tonight my brother had a get together at his place and he invited me over. He knows that I don't drink but wanted to include me since I haven't seen some of the people there for a long time. By the time that I got there everyone was pretty much half in the bag. It was kind of weird at first and not gonna lie it felt like babysitting every now and then but I still had fun. After getting caught up in some cards against humanity and watching a movie the little voice telling me to drink just kind of fluttered away. Definitely the most tempting moment for me to relapse yet but I made it yet another day!

Congrats dude! It takes a lot of strength to be around people drinking and not give in. 
Well done! That s a formidable test on your resolve and will power :-) I will not drink with you today!
