I made it. I still have a very long way to go and it hasn't been easy to be sober everyday but here I am. Every time I have these cravings I. Just. Don't. Drink. Today I am opening a restaurant where everybody will be drinking and there will be a lot of pressure to join in. I'm glad that my 30 days falls on today because I am not going to break! I will not drink with all of you guy!..For all those struggling. Sometimes when I'm having a hard time I tune into that gut feeling of all the horrible things I did when I was at my worst. When I was drinking I didn't care but now that I'm sober I'm able to realize that's not the person I am or want to be. At first it makes me want a drink to escape but that passes.  It's hip to be square  ..To coffee and soda water and being sober here's to 30.

"Playing the tape forward" to think what can happen is a powerful tool in my 'Sobriety Toolbox'!  Keep fighting the good fight!
Congrats and good luck with the opening. I'll be at an office party at the same time. I'm the only teatotaler in the group of about 30. Good reminder about remembering the things you did while drinking that you regret. ..And it IS hip to be square lol
