hey r/stopdrinking ..against my better judgment and the recommendations of people in my sober network I tried getting back in the dating game. Long story short I had a brief fling that crashed and burned and while I didn't relapse over it it almost feels like I did in terms of the stress involved. ..I guess what I'm trying to say is that I just sort of assumed that getting sober meant I wouldn't ever really get "hungover" again. But I've been discovering that there are things like cigarette hangovers caffeine hangovers and emotional hangovers. ..This sobriety stuff is confusing!

The real work to be don on myself has become really apparent ever since I stopped having alcohol covering everything up.  
Yea it's different and it's really early in the game for you here.  This sobriety thing is a huge deal and they say not to make any big decisions your first year.  All that aside companionship is nice.  ...Now the real question for a potential spouse is what's your relationship with alcohol ?  Honestly I didn't want to deal with it.  How funny and ironic is that shit ? After drinking like a jack ass and carrying on for 15 years and running my wife off I'm now saying hey that behavior is inappropriate and now even I won't stand for it.  It took me dating some people that were drinking to realize this.  That moment you can now tell when someone is impaired or "not present" is so Fucking unattractive on every level now....It feels even odd to type this as this was my behavior for years
