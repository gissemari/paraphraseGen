The guy that helped lead me to sobriety relapsed 2 nights ago. He wasn't so much a drinker as he was a heroine user. He was so strong and sure of himself in his sobriety. He just got his 6 month coin. Now he's back to square one if he even wants to be there. It hurts my heart more than I thought it would. I'm hurt and I'm angry. I don't want to look at him. I pity him. Things were looking so up for him. And he just threw it away. I just need to know why. We just talked Monday about how 2018 was our year. I just don't get it. I mean I do but I don't. One of the things that kept me from relapsing early on was having to face him - the shame and guilt I would have felt doing that. And I thought he felt the same. I guess not. Either way I'm going to bed sober and I'm waking up sober. Thanks for reading.
