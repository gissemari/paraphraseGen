(ignore the badge it needs to be updated)..I've struggled with alcohol and trying to quit for a solid 3 years now. I'm a serial quitter and always down on myself every time I reach for another 6 pack...For the past half year I've been drinking again. I had a good run at the beginning of the year for about 4 months completely sober. But then I lost sight of my goals and talked myself out of some of them. I shouldn't have done that or at least made new different goals right away. Anyway once my goals were out of the picture it was easy for me convince myself to pick up drinking alcohol again. Too easy. I think I forgot why I started in the first place. Maybe this was because my drinking never got that bad. I never missed days work because of my drinking and I never went hard into the hard stuff. Just enough for me to dull the senses while I passively browse the internet and keep coasting in life. ..That's the insidious nature of alcohol. Once you accept it into your life it's hard to break away from it since it's a very addicting substance. And then you get stuck in a rut of drinking and because now you're chemically addicted it's much harder to get out of that rut and try something new or different. I'm 2 years quit from smoking and I think alcohol is the harder of the two by quite a bit...I hope to replace drinking with gym-going writing reading or even just being able to complete video games or TV shows/movies. ..I know that a IRL support group would be the best but I want to hold myself accountable in some fashion. So I've decided to start posting weekly maybe daily updates. I've been subbed for a few years here and this subreddit really has a great community. Thanks for taking the time to read!

I've found the key to succeeding more now than i did my last attempt was learning from my mistakes. Otherwise it's just the same struggles with similar results.  So set those goals like writing or going to the gym and replace drinking with something you want in your life!  You've gone multiple months without so you know you can do it.  Really WANTING it has made it easier for me to figure out how to achieve my goals. .
