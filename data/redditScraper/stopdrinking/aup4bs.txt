Hi All .I was supposed to go to my third meeting tonight and was ramped up for it but all the roads are closed where I am today and I can't get to one. .To make matters worse my ex (of 3 months together for 2 years who I am still living with) wanted to have her new girlfriend stay over because the roads were bad and I said no because we decided the house needed to still be a safe place. .I want to drink because it makes me feel sick and I want to be numb again and just pass out. Im trying to remind myself that drinking wont help. ..Any advice. Im trying so hard

Good job checking in here. Your ex's request is selfish and unfair and I hope they come to understand that. There is a [chat room](https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/#irc://irc.snoonet.org:+6697/stopdrinking) in the righthand column that might be able to stand in for your missed meeting. Be well. I will not drink with you tonight.
SMART has online meetings - [smartrecovery.org](https://smartrecovery.org)..Also there is a chat room running 24/7 with a lot of support linked on the side bar.
Chiming in to say I'm sorry your ex isn't considering your well-being. Also that I very much empathize with you very strongly so. My life seems to get worse and worse in the last few weeks and keeping sober when I desperately want it to all go away in a numb cloud is so difficult. However every day I don't drink I wake up thankful and remind myself that if i had drank then all of my problems would still be there only worse. Sending warm thoughts of peace your way.
