I am celebrating 8 years clean and sober today.  I wanted to share so that if anyone is struggling you know it is possible. ..I know that my life is world's better than it use to be. I have a job that wants me to be at work.  I have friends and family that care about me and look to me for help.  My life doesn't resemble my former life anymore and I'm proud to say it. ..It hasn't always been easy but it has been worth it. ..I wish everyone the best.
