Basically just took it out on my wife because she says it's not a good idea to drink tonight as I really wanted to but after a couple weeks I feel it getting harder and harder. I feel bad but I'm still angry I know it's my mind playing tricks on me and me deflecting blame. It is really crazy the tricks the mind play on you.

There's more to getting well than simply not drinking. AA and therapy helped me have a sober happy life. 
What helps me is the recognition that a craving is an emotion an intense desire for (in this case) alcohol.  Like a lot of emotions that I don't give in to--they pass.  Unfortunately we tend to wallow in this specific emotion in early sobriety--so as /u/SOmuch2learn suggests it helps to implement other strategies because our experience is--give sustained time sober the emotion of craving fades if we don't give in and reinforce it.  
This weekend has been rough on me too. I've been craving any kind of dopamine release my mind can think of - booze pot sex anger etc. Finally had to take a long walk to clear my head followed by re-reading some saved SD posts to bring back the focus:  I will not drink today.  Hang in there.
