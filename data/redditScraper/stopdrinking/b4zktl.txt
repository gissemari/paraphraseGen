..It can be quite revealing to reflect on past posts when I was really struggling. ..Excerpt from my POST on 2018 ..I am 33 years old and I am 10lbs overweight liver spots have invaded my face my skin is dry and blotchy my nose is red and my legs and arms have cellulite. All of this was not present in December. Maybe I just wasnt paying attention and let myself go. I am very vain I used to model a lot and this as shallow as it may seem was my wake up call! I looked in the mirror and did not recognize myself. I had gotten to the point where I would wake up in the morning and take 3 or 4 shots of tequila on an empty stomach and then continue on into the night drinking...Then I stopped drinking. Jan 1 2019..Flash forward to TODAY: ..I am 34 years old and I have lost 15lbs in 3 months. Because I'm never hungover I am able to workout 3x a week and practice yoga regularly.  My arms and legs are getting toned again and the  cellulite  has literally disappeared. The belly bloat is drastically reduced. My digestion has also greatly improved helping my skin look glowing and bright. .I wake up in the morning and thank the powers that be because I am alive well and thoroughly blessed.  ..Furthermore the positive effects on my mood career relationships finances creativity and self-worth are immeasurable. ..This may sound dramatic to some but because of my choice to stop consuming alcohol the doors to my dreams have been opening one after another. ..IWNDWYT ..
