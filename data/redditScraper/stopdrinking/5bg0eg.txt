I started this endeavor thinking it would be for only 90 days or so. I didn't have a huge problem I was at worst a functional alcoholic. I never missed work or obligations because of drinking I never drive drunk and I could have just one drink at social engagements. At home though my SO and I drank copious amounts. Drinking was what we did together. ..We have a teen daughter. I started worrying about how my drinking might be affecting her. It was easier to hide it when she was younger and had a bedtime...things changed and she needs a sober parent to drive her places and be available for her at night when she needed to talk. I started resenting her encroaching on my drink time. I didn't like giving up a Friday night of drinking to go pick her up from a dance.  It sort of snuck up on me....I had a choice of being a shitty parent or not. To keep drinking as my main activity in life or to stop and expand my horizons a bit...My SO and I stopped together last January. I relapsed soon after. Resetting my badge sucked but I got such a kind message of support too that I decided to try again. It was hard. My best friend's big birthday was in February and I drove hundreds of miles to be there. She totally supported me in sobriety but didn't really get the WHY since I'd hidden the depths of my drinking for so long. The party had lots of my favorite booze...and her husband telling me it was a "waste" that I'd stopped drinking. I guess I was good at it?? This sub totally got me through a tough weekend...This sub has been there for me at my most tempted moments. It's been there for me when someone recommended **This Naked Mind** to read. I bought it immediately but took a while to read it. I'd been struggling with thoughts of moderation...I could not fathom never drinking again. That book changed the game completely. My entire understanding of alcohol and why I drank changed. I also read **The Biology of Addiction** which was also good but not as straightforward as **Naked Mind**...Now it does not matter if I consider myself an alcoholic functional alcoholic problem drinker or a drunk. Drinking stops me from being the best version of me I can be. My relationship with my daughter is 200% better. My clarity of thought amazes me and I can be focused and productive with minimal effort. My mornings are GREAT! No more fuzzy foggy sick mornings. My stomach issues disappeared (ya'll know I'm talkin' about). ..It gets easier but there are still obstacles and stumbling blocks. My SO is drinking again albeit not as frequently and not as much but it's a challenge for me. I still need to be mindful of what triggers my desire to drink. I've learned an awful lot about myself. I know I cannot have that first drink. Just that one. I know it will soften my resolve and convince me to have more in order to chase a buzz I don't really need. ..Thank you SD. All of you have helped me get here and encouraged on. To the new folks struggling I was there too. Post your experiences because it helps us further along to remember what we're trying to do. To the dinos out there that take the time to read and reply thank you. Your posts inspire me to keep going. And to everyone in between my brothers and sisters your posts remind me I am not alone. Thanks to all of you. I will not drink with you today...

Yes yes yes! This post makes my heart sing. Being a better parent is one of the biggest rewards of sobriety for me. I love your success story of being present for your daughter. Congrats on 300!
