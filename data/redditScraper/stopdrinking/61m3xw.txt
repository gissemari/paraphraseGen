Here I am coming back from a two day bender when I know so much better.....I finally admitted it to my parents and some of my best friends. I have a problem. I am an alcoholic and I am hurting myself. This needs to stop...I decided to go to a happy hour with some friends from work Thursday night. No problem right? I had a beer with them and some food. Well when we were all set I decided to go to a different bar. I got there met up with some people I know and continued to drink. Then I went to another bar...until morning time when I woke up in a ditch of the parking lot of a vacant building. Thankfully there is a giant brick wall around it that protected me from being seen. Nonetheless that was my rock bottom...What'd I do after that? I kept drinking. I was trying to mask the pain with more alcohol knowing damn well that that makes it worse. This led to me losing my phone my car keys and my wallet...Now I'm at my parents' home typing this and not knowing what's going to happen. I'm looking for information about meetings. I don't know how work is going to be tomorrow...Day 1 begins. I pray this is my final day 1. I can't go back to the way I used to be...Thank you for reading.

Sounds like you had a rough night. I can't remember what happened past 9pm myself. I've spent all day reading people's posts I'm feeling much more positive 6 hrs later. Keep reading and posting. Set a reminder to post something on Tuesday or what ever day you think you are likely to want to drink again. That's my plan. I'm going to post something at 9pm on Tuesday that will be my day 3. Happy hour is never the hour unless your one of those lucky 3 drinks 2 waters and home types. I think that all 62511 of us on here can never be the 32 home type.
This attempt at sobriety is the first time I talked to my friends and parents about it.  Does it guarantee success?  No but it is a step and a change from my past failed attempts.  Learning from our mistakes in all aspects of life help us to grow...I'm also avoiding going to any sort of bars or events where heavy drinking is involved.  I get to a different level of drunk than 100% of my close friends and about 75% (percentages are dumb but whatever) of my drinking buddies.  Even people who are also clearly heavy drinkers seem to hold it together more than me.  That's why I'm here.  I can't handle alcohol.
