This is why I knew HALT before AA or outside the context of drinking/addiction: I really struggle with ways to soothe myself in the moment. (Which is why alcohol). Today is day 26 and I'm just so physically uncomfortable which I know makes me vulnerable to wanting to escape. Woken up by noise. Then a breakfast that made my cold worse. Cleaning going on around the house which raised up more dust and the sneezies. A cetirizine didn't help. Arghhhhh. Just want to get out of here. But I'm scared that if I do I'll use. I kept clicking and refreshing for the check-in so that I could ground myself but I'm just going to do my mini check in. I can handle this. I can do this. I'm not going to drink today and I'm going to rest in my sobriety at least even if everything else sucks. I have water steaming for a steam inhalation now. ..Five things I'm grateful for today:..1. My new espresso maker..2. The women in recovery meeting I have later today though I don't know if I'll be feeling well enough to make it..3. Leftover pepper rasam in the fridge..4. Sunshine and warmth..5. Sobriety always sobriety. Not gonna let myself forget how valuable it is to me...Help thanks wow r/stopdrinking!

first off congrats on day 26 thats a huge accomplishment!  huge.  second and more importantly:  hot baths never fail me when it comes to physical discomfort.  never.  i just turn off the lights turn on some music and lie down in a hot bath with my eyes closed for like 15-20 minutes.  it works magic on nausea chills aches restlessness all that fun stuff.  i hope you feel better soon!

I have the same thing just never comfortable. I recently started doing breathing excercises/meditation for the first time in my life and it's really helping me. I just breathe in for 2 seconds hold for 2 and slowly breathe out for 45 or 6. I do it in the morning and really try to be aware of my breathing and that's it. Just try to be fully aware of my mind body and breathing. I usually do it a few more times during the day when I'm stressing. When I'm stressing when I do this I say to myself "Now imagine trying to something this simple when you were wasted or hungover." That always puts whatever I'm streesing about in perspective and calms me down/makes me more comfortable in my own skin. It's simple and effective for me. I hope you find something that works for you. You've got a great list of 5 things to work with already. Number 3 is making me hungry. Good luck you're not alone.  IWNDWYT. :-)
