I thought that I was different just like everyone else. And who knows maybe we all are..heh... but two days ago I woke up and wondered if it was worth to prove to myself that I'm different. Is it worth putting my family and friends through my mood swings? Is it worth possibly losing my wonderful partner who has held my hand through the last two years of struggles and continues to believe in me? Is it worth the anxiety or the regret? The shame? And I know when you start having to ask those questions you have to make a change. ..I can't change my past I can't change the sexual assaults or abuses but I can try to find a way to heal rather than to stop feeling. I know life is going to bring me pain but I would rather have pain and joy than the numbness that I get from drinking. I know this journey is something we all have to do alone but I just feel so alone right now--so I'm writing hoping maybe someone will understand...I don't know if I believe in "rock bottom" I believe that everyone has a different level of consequences they need to change a behavior. But if I did the way I felt when Mr. Kadabblebabble looked at me this week was it. It's day two so right now I'm still one minute at a time knowing that nothing is ever so bad that it can't change. Just looking for some support on the journey hoping I'm not just yelling into the void.
