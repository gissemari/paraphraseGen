I have been struggling with some major depression lately ended up losing my job because i was having trouble just getting out of bed in the morning an was not doing a good job at work. now i have put myself on an intense cleaning and exercise schedule. i clean the whole house every day and am exercising 2-3 times a day.. nothing too crazy just some long walks and bike rides.. i have a treadmill in front of a big screen so i'm also catching up on netflix! let me say this really helps so much better than just staying in bed all day waiting to feel better. i have had some cravings certainly but i have been fighting them with endorphins doing crazy shit to my hair and planning to get in super good shape this summer. i simply picture myself at my worst fattest drunk state and remember that i never want to be there again. i want to be one of those skinny runner chicks that make me uber jealous seeing their spandexed perfect asses. that will be me someday. it also helps having a sober buddy to stay in touch with and keeping each other accountable and admitting when we are feeling triggers. one of the things that has been the hardest for me is admitting when i am subconsciously acknowledging that if i go do such and such i will probably end up allowing myself to drink. i have been SO good in the past at ignoring signs of triggers and would just go into situations deep down knowing i was probably going to just break down and drink at some point. recently avoided a possibly very fun activity because i knew i would end up wanting a drink. summer itself is generally a huge trigger for me so i am just planning to be antisocial spend time with my family (who mostly don't drink) and completely ignore situations that even have a hint of a trigger for me. anyway just thought i would check in and ramble sorry for my horrible lack of caps.

I'm sorry you lost your job that totally sucks.  However you are embarking on a long journey and are in a fragile place so keep the worst fattest drunk state image warm.  TBH I also want an ass that looks perfect in spandex. Let's say it looks a world better than it did a year ago.
Vanity is a huge motivator for me. It helped me quit smoking years ago so that I wouldn't get unecessary wrinkles (I do have an e-cig though I'll quit that eventually). I look younger than my age which I like but booze bloat and extra weight is taking its toll. I want to be hot and in shape which I know I can be. I think you should use whatever motivates you to quit...It sounds like you have a really solid plan. Take care of yourself and good luck!
