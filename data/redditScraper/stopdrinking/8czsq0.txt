I am celebrating 11 days sober. Last night was *hell* for me but I made it. ..Today has been another story. I woke up went to an amazing AA meeting and have been busy with my husband ever since running errands for work and such. ..Well he mentioned a thing he did last summer "Tequila Summer" where all he drank was Tequila. It sparked something in me. ..Were both off tonight and all I can think about is drinking. I've all but convinced myself that I don't *actually* have a problem. ..*I can moderate better then before if I just try.* ..Or ..*I can get sober after the cruise in 3 weeks.* ..Or even ..*I can get a 'little' drunk and then stop.* ..I'm struggling bad today. I'm not sure I will finish the  day/night sober.

Sorry to hear you're struggling!..I call that little inner demon the *Booze Goblin* and he's a lying little shit!..You can do this and we're all here cheering you on.....If you can find something to distract yourself for a while have a good feed and lashings of fizzy water the cravings will soon peak and then fade away... All you have to do is wait it out and it soon gets easier.....Don't feed the Booze Goblin!!..I won't drink with you today ..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Or you can stay sober and check out the cruise line to see if they will be offering  Friends of Bill W  meetings during your cruise.  
Hey!  Were both on day 12!  We can get through today.  
I thought the same thing recently when I went camping with my husband. We always drank in the car on the way out for the weekend. It was so HARD not to. That was my way of ending the week starting the fun how was that going to happen without drinking?!..Luckily I set up my life which makes it more difficult to drink. For example my husband knows I'm not drinking and he agreed that those were good ol' days but now we're trying something different. ..You know what that car ride was awesome. I talked to my husband about deep stuff we laughed. Then we set up camp made dinner and I wasn't too drunk or tired to connect with him. ..That day I proved to myself that I could NOT drink in that situation and it didn't ruin everything. And I thought that maybe next time when I chose not to drink it may not suck either.
