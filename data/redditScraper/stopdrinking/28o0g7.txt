My older brother unfortunately is an alcoholic and has a history of problems with mental health. He was diagnosed with psychosis and has been on drugs and drinking almost non stop for close to 10 years!!..About 5 months ago he quit drinking smoking stopped taking his drug and went vegan aswell and lost a lot of weight and was doing great...Recently he relapsed and is doing a lot worse. He has been extremely nervous lately anxious and stressed. Even worse it seems his personality has changed. He talks in a different tone of voice and seems detached from reality. He will think certain things have bad energy like he made me throw out a painting in his house and he couldn't look at it. Just extremely strange behavior...We took him to the doctor and we have an appointment to get him looked at by a psychiatrist. In the mean time he still asks me to buy him alcohol. All I want is my brother to get back to normal and I think alcohol needs to go. But I know how hard it is to quit. I'm not sure what to do or how to help him.

Absolutely not. Enabling him isn't helping anyone.
I can't fathom how you need to ask this question.  No I can see no good reason to buy him booze.

I'd say no. But you might also find some perspective from /r/AlAnon...
Alcohol is especially devastating for someone with mental health issues. Please do not contribute to your brother's decompensation by buying him alcohol. ..Be honest with the psychiatrist about your brother's drinking. Your brother will be an unrealiable self reporter. He is seriously in need of psychiatric intervention.

suggest /r/alanon as a resource for you...as for buying him booze no.  Not a good idea.
