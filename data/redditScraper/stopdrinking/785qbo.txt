I went to a meeting tonight. It is one connected to the Buddhist Recovery Network which I like since I used to have a regular practice- something I have been wanting to get back to. I also have some hesitation with AA. I went to some meetings with an ex who was sober and a couple years later I went to a meeting for myself. I was sober and then only drank occasionally for a while but recently this has not been the case and an addiction has quickly resurfaced. I was also in a terrible relationship the past couple years. Not terrible on the surface but nonetheless unhealthy. Anyway... everything has spiraled a bit and I have been repeating mistakes and unhealthy behaviors the past 6 months or so that I know are only going to get worse. Dangerously so. If not already. I'm lucky at this point. .It was interesting and difficult to attend this meeting and although I have decided to stop drinking (for a while- it's difficult to stick with the forever thing right now) I am struggling. I am anxious about the future and about confronting all that I should. .Any advice about AA? The main reason I am considering it right now is simply for guidance and community. I'd like to know other sober (20-30s especially) adults...

Welcome I didn't do AA so nothing to add in that space but I will share a little of my journey. It sounds like you are sitting on the precipice and could jump either way.  I got sober by reading self development / self awareness blogs and following a number of on line sober bloggers reading and commenting on this site...daily twice a day if necessary.  I tried many times before this time stuck.  The light went on and seriously I have not looked bag.  At the end of my drinking days I was drinking two bottles of wine a night.  I look back and wonder who that person was.....that's addiction for you..it was not me but it was what I was doing.  I regret nothing because it all made me who I am today but I wish the light bulb had gone on in my 30's ....I hope it goes on for you sooner rather than later...because I love my sober life I love who I have become and I want you to know that happiness...but it took work....and a lot of self reflection self awareness and humility....I was not perfect I did not know everything and I needed to really understand the serenity prayer not just say the words....good luck
Wishing you the best.  This sub is a compassionate and welcoming place.  You can do it!
