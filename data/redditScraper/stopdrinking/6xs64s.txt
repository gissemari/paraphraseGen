I'm feeling good at having gone a weekend not drinking with my full family where beer starts late morning vodka late afternoon and wine through the night. I didn't really struggle but had triggers all over the place and I felt a drink would have been nice. It was a lovely weekend. There were dolphins playing in the surf. We walked the beach on the first day of spring and cooked great food and laughed a lot. They didn't give me much shit for abstaining.  I think my biggest enemy is going to be forgetting what a mess I (my life) was when drinking.  .
