I'm super proud that I made it past the second week. I can't remember the last time I went this long truly 100% sober. I'm definitely nervous about this next coming week though. Everyone is going to be drinking a massive amount because of the holidays. I actually had to tell my paternal side of the family that I couldn't go to Christmas Eve celebrations with them this year though I didn't explain why. Not fun. I can see why people relapse often during the holiday season. It's hard to distance from friends and family who will be drinking...Despite this I will continue to not drink with you all :)..Happy Holidays!

Congrats!  Thats awesome.  Happy holidays to you as well.
Cool it only gets better. For me there are ups and downs but nothing as low as the bottom of my bottom. When I have to excuse myself from something I find something else to DO. Action not thinking has to replace drinking or I feel sorry for myself. At best I become anxious at worst I put myself in position to drink which destroys me.
15 days! Good for you and hope you sail through the holidays.
Great work..We got this
