When I use to go to hotels that had the 'Hosts Special' where they'd have some light snacks and free drinks and select beers it would drive me nuts.  I struggled to see how may times I could hit the bar to slam as many drinks or beers as possible.  The line length would kill me.  My wife's monitoring of my activity was also annoying.   I would always want to make sure we got back to the hotel in time and I wanted to take advantage of the full available time frame.   I bring this up because we're going on a trip within a month and I think they have the same thing there.  It will be tough.  I'm going to ask for a non\-alcoholic Bloody Mary with extra olives and celery.  I'll make it a meal/drink.

lol that actually sounds really good to me right now. The Bloody Mary with extras... I honestly have never had one even though I have tended bar for like 11 years.
