Hanging out with a couple old friends they were taking shots of my favorite alcohol. We haven't seen Each other in ten years! It was great but I had to leave early. Especially now I'm really struggling. One was mad at me for leaving.. Oh well! It's not for him to understand. Another day I'm alcohol free :)

good on you.  You live to tell another day!
Well done - sometimes it's important to know when to set a boundary and looks like you've got that working for you! Hopefully the old friend that was a bit cross about you leaving gets over it and realises the point of any friendship is [ideally] not just about drinking together it's about caring about each other and respecting that sometimes a gal's gotta do what a gal's gotta do..
Good for you! Well done!
Good job getting out of there.  If they were taking shots then likely the conversation and activities degenerated pretty quickly anyway.  I find I really don't miss out on the good stuff but I miss more of the bad stuff. :).
I made the mistake of not walking away from a situation I knew was playing w fire didn't end well. I appreciate your post. 
Right on. ..I will not drink with you today!
Good on you!!
