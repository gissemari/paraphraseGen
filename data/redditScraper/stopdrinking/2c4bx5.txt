Yup.  Day 2 and the insomnia is in full force.  I'll get through this.  The struggle is real but it's going to be worth it in the long run.

Yes you will get through this. Keep trudging my friend. It does get better.
Despite the fact that I had 4 drinks tonight (as opposed to my usual 8-10) I can't sleep. I even just cooked myself some food and I'm watching a movie as we speak. I can't remember the last time I fell asleep naturally -__-
Something that really helped me out was a 10-20mg does of melatonin.  Check it out yo! :)
Good for you!  Let's make a decision to not drink TODAY day 3.
Yes  the sleep will come  and it will be fantastic sleep.  I awake every day and ask God to make me his servant  and to not drink today.  
Like people have said it gets better. For me the insomnia only lasted a few nights.... then every night got better and better. Keep at it!
Trudge through it.  I'm convinced that day 2 or sometimes day 3 is the worst.   At the suggestion of /u/offtherocks   I made a chart to count down the the hours of the first week.  [Here is his chart](http://i.imgur.com/9WumIUV.jpg)..That made things a little easier for me.  I also attached ghirardelli dark chocolate squares to each 24 hour period lol.   
I'm feeling you my insomnia was also having a fun time with my head last night.  But it will totally get better.  Hang in there!
