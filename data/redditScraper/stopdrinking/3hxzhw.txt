I keep waking up feeling like shit. I keep saying I won't drink today. As soon as I start feeling better come 4/5pm I'm happily cracking open a bottle of beer. I want this bad but I'm really struggling to even get through the first 24 hours.

That's because breaking the daily habit is the hardest part. Waking up sober is awesome come on try it :)
This is normal and you can do it! It will be uncomfortable for a few days but you'll break through it. Can you find ways to distract yourself in the afternoon? Exercise is really good and will make you tired. Movies dinner tea bowling. What do you say? :)
I was the exact same way. I needed help so finally I asked for it. I was desperate and I very begrudgingly went to an AA meeting. It worked for me and continues to work for me. Have you spoken to anyone in real life about this? Friend? Family? Doctor? Therapist? That would be a good start. If you find you're too scared to do that know that that is your addiction keeping you addicted.
