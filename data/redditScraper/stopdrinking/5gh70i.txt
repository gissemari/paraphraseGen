I've been lurking for a while and decided to share my story in hopes of support and not relapsing... again. I have had a drinking problem since I have been able to buy alcohol (21). I've made a fool of myself in front of friends family and co-workers but everyone just passed it off as "it's who he is." I recently met my soul mate. She is the best and I would do anything for her. She noticed my problem but never tried to change who I was until one night when I got so drunk I had to be carried out of the bar. This after 2 years of being together. She gave me the ultimatum - stop drinking or I am going to leave you. So I stopped - cold turkey. and went an entire month sober. Last night I relapsed at a wedding anniversary party... open bar. She is mad at me again and i do not know how to go about trying to fix this relationship. Alcohol is the problem and I don't know how to "just not drink anymore." I feel as though she doesn't understand this struggle. It is as though i am addicted to the liquor and i want so bad to quit But i don't know how and i don't know how to explain to her how hard it is for me...

I had to focus on getting help for myself. Once trust is broken in a relationship it takes a long time to rebuild. The only way to do it is to be sober. There is help when we are ready.
