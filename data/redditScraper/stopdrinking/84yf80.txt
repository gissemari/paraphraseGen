I know it seems childish but it's new commitment for me today we drinking peach juice with jerba tea! Thank to everyone I came back after recent relapse and feel confident with new experience!

Congrats! I reset today as well. Feeling motivated and hopeful  
Yeey! Congratulations! This is a great place to be. I learned more about myself in a few months here than I did for a decade rambling on my own. It really picked up pace when I began participating. So I'm happy you're here and that you're excited! I will not drink with you today!
