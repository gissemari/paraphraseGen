. I just wanted to express my heartfelt gratitude yesterday I was really feeling rather alone and desperate and isolated and just struggling personally and I posted that on this group and there was such a wonderful response that really helped me and I am so very very grateful to have this as a means of communication and this really helped me happy to report that I survived without picking up and thank you to those who talked me off the ledge
