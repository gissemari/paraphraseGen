I have decided to quit drinking. I have done this before but always relapsed. I drink on a Friday after a weeks work and feel it helps me chill out after a weeks work. The problem is I don't know when to stop and get the worst depressive hangovers ever. ..My mum was an alcoholic and although I'm not what I would call an alcoholic I am becoming concerned about its becoming the norm to drink on a Friday to unwind. I have 3 young boys and the hangover days of lying on the couch need to stop. I don't think meetings are for me and I desperately want to stop. I just need pointers or apps or anything people find useful to stop. I aways get to a point where I think drinking is ok actually ill just have a couple and then I'm back to square one...Does anyone recommend listening to hypnosis or anything like that? Any advice is grateful.

I listen to a lot of podcasts. Cafe RE that sober guy etc. I never used to think meetings were for me either but I love them now. Won't drink with you today! 
I used Eldon Taylor's Nuero-Linguistic Programming CD when I quit smoking. I had smoked 33 years.  I listened twice and quit. I gave it to my neighbor and he listened once and quit.  Eldon Taylor is used by CEOs Olympic athletes and all kinds of people with different goals.  Thanks for asking because I bought the NLP CD for substance abuse too.  And guess what I forgot about it. I'm going to play it now. Thanks for the reminder.  It sounds like ocean waves and you can barely detect  the sound of the suggestions under the sound of the waves.  The suggestion to your subconscious is you really don't want to drink.  I am going to put it on now.  Many thanks!  I won't drink with you today.
