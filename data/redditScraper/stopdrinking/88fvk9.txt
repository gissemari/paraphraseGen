So my boyfriend was supposed to come down for the weekend. I even invited my parents over for Easter. Now he's blowing me off and I'm angry and sad. I feel rejected and like he's taking advantage of me assuming that I will forgive him and move on. I feel like I am not important to him - I know I am but he is treating me like someone he can neglect and then it'll just get swept under the rug and forgotten about. ..ANYWAY the point is that now I am by myself for the weekend and very sad and angry and I feel betrayed. And... I want to drink so badly I can't stand it.

Don't drink! I'm just coming off a mini bender and it's horrible. The feelings I thought were so bad when I was sober were nothing compared to what I experience after drinking. I'm sorry you're hurting. You're not alone.
You're not alone. I will not drink with you today. 
I'm sure you're important to him winterwoods; he probably just doesn't understand how vulnerable you feel right now.  ..Can you plan other nice things for yourself that you wouldn't get to do otherwise?  Box set marathon of something he wouldn't like walks or trips cooking yourself a fancy meal for one? A tonne of sobriety reading helped me to change my  default to drink' setting and passed the time for me early on   would that help?..Check in with us loads over the weekend   we get it and you're important to us!  ..
Cmon over and we can color Easter eggs . I hope you can boil water cause I have a hard time with that . I'll supply the club soda and limes .
