&gt; I'm plow to whatever support works...I totally agree with this approach.  What am I willing to do to stay sober?  Whatever it takes.
I like your approach too! Just keep doing what's working. If it ain't broke don't fix it. I found going to different meetings helps keep things interesting and getting a service position helped too (making coffee cleaning up stacking chairs etc).
