I'm having such a hard time focusing at work.  I'm not really at risk of getting into any sort of trouble.  I'm a lawyer with no immediate deadlines.  But it's really uncomfortable.  I start working on something then get distracted then just sit there looking at my screen.  I also feel exhausted even though I've been getting plenty of sleep and exercise.  Ugh.  I hope this won't last too long.  Either way I won't drink today.

I will join you in not drinking. 
I found I had these short bursts of intense focus followed by a haze of not being able to do much for most of the day. It will pass. 
In exactly the same boat!!! Meant to be studying (currently a student) and cant seem to focus at all! Wont be drinking today with you!!!!
