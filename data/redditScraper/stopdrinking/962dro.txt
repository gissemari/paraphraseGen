I honestly don't really know why I'm putting this out there I think I just need to hear from others that understand. I really finally thought I had it figured out this time. I went through detox for the first time earlier this year after many years of drinking and using. I had almost 2 months completely sober then relapsed. Hard. I am now on day 2 of detox again feel awful physically but also emotionally. .I knew the journey to getting better would be one of the hardest things I have ever done but I felt like I had a hold on it and crashed. My fiancee is being more supportive than I could have ever hoped for and I feel so lucky for that. I just feel like I'm going to fail in some way. .On one hand I feel like this will never end but on the other I'm hopeful that I can make it through and stay sober again.
