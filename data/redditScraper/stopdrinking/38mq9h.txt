Grateful I'm home from San Francisco sober. Didn't even feel like a struggle thanks to my HP my sober peeps here and from AA. Going to a mtg in a dif city was an awesome experience

I'm off to a different city tomorrow and have a meeting lined up! I am excited! Meetings in new cities are fun cause you're even more special than normal ;)
