I talked to my brother on the phone today finally told him I'd quit drinking & got a much more supportive response than I was expecting (my brother has a severe problem with alcohol and doesn't seem to want to change or think he's ready) but he also told me that our dad who has been sober for five years or so I think has relapsed and is avoiding going back to AA...It's important for me to maintain strong boundaries with my alcoholic family members but I'm going to call my dad tomorrow and encourage him to go to a meeting.  I just hope he knows well enough by now not to let his sobriety become my responsibility.

Great viewpoint on the family stuff TD.  Your sobriety is yours so it's good to protect it.  Congrats on 61
My mother is an alcoholic who has never tried to be sober.  She is supportive of me but I can tell she just doesn't "get it" And I've never bothered to try and get her to think differently because I know I'll be beating my head against a wall.  ..think it's nice for you to reach out to your dad maybe it will be a good jump start for him if you can get him to go to a meeting with you.  If not well that's his choice.  It sounds like you already have a good mindset about taking care of yourself first.  
Congrats on 60 days thats a big deal! Im sorry to hear about the family drama. I'm afraid there isn't much you can do regarding your brother or dad apart from suggesting going back to meetings. They will both probably have to come to that decision on their own. Good luck I know this must be tough. 
Kudos for 60 days. It's up to you not to let family drama become your responsibility. Setting boundaries isn't easy but it's the only way.
