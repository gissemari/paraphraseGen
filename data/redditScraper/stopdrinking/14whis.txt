Sobernauts:..Another transmission from the frontier of sobriety...I made it two weeks. ..Historically (when I've tried to stop cold turkey) it's been absurdly difficult for me to make it for just five days . . . even under ideal circumstance. Yet despite [struggling with depression](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/14ibuh/im_a_drain_on_everyone_around_me_and_the_only/c7dd99a?context=3) [breaking up with my SO](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/14sqx6/what_event_was_the_clincher_in_you_seeking/c7gkgjn?context=3) [quitting my job](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/14i8av/this_morning_i_was_weak/c7dc21m?context=3) taking my final exams and [enduring an anxiety-triggering cross-country flight](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/14qteq/almost_broke_down_today_and_might_still_unhappily/) I haven't picked up...I'm honestly prouder of that little yellow badge with the red number than anything else in my life right now...Having made it this far I feel like I have arrived at a place of [abiding calm](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/14nmla/ten_days_and_a_descending_quiet_calm/). The reprieve is well-received...But the concern I have is this: You know that scene in the horror movie when the monster has been vanquished and everything seems to be okay? The one that immediately procedes the terrifying resurrection of the beast who later goes on to inflict his final reign of terror?..I feel my drinking is a bit like that right now. ..It appears as though I have reached ["the Pink Cloud"](http://www.soberrecovery.com/drug-rehabilitation-alcohol-treatment/tag/recovery-and-the-pink-cloud) where:..> [I am] excited at the prospect of what recovery from addiction and alcoholism has to offer and feel as if [I] have grasped what it takes to maintain quality recovery. All the work [I] have done . . . has paid off and [I have] experience[d] a reprieve from all the difficulties that have crossed [my] path...Yet the monster slumbers . . ...I distrust myself and am anxious about dropping my guard...I must remain vigilant...So I pose this question to those of you who have made it past the Cloud (and to SD generally): How do you avoid complacency?
----------immediate responses--------

Just stay sober today. Don't worry about tomorrow. Or next week. Or last week. Be grateful for today. Then if tomorrow should come stay sober for one day again.
Keep writing.  
"I'm honestly prouder of that little yellow badge with the red number than anything else in my life right now."..That silly little badge is such a motivator isn't it? I come and post each day watching that number grow and turn into something I can be proud of. ..Congrats on two weeks! Enjoy the cloud while you can just don't let it trick you into drinking again by trying to chase the feeling with alcohol. I've been told to expect it to fade but to not let that feel like failure or moving backwards in recovery. But what do I know day 6 here :)
I was really passionate about quitting from the go and I definitely had fears about taking my sobriety too lightly. I wasn't going to meetings and plenty of people will tell you that if you're not going to meetings you're doing something wrong. I didn't really jive with the "one day at a time" motto. I didn't want to quit for one day then one day then one day... I wanted to quit forever and be okay with that idea...But I was working at my sobriety nevertheless. I spent a lot of time on SD I was teaching myself how to live sober and not avoid tasks that reminded me of drinking (like drawing playing games and spending time with friends). I was taking the time to figure out why I quit and why it was important to me to never drink again. This might seem obvious or self-explanatory but to the alcoholic brain... IT'S NOT. I know some people disagree but for me I have to know and reinforce absolutely why I quit and why I want to remain quit or eventually- not today not tomorrow but eventually- I'll return to drinking. Drinking is the alcoholic's default state and to defy it you've got to be active in your sobriety...Nowadays when I start to get a casual feeling about drinking again this thought keeps popping up in my head. Since quitting I've gained back a lot of self esteem. I dislodged myself from an overwhelming rut. I quit a dissatisfying job. I traveled 3000 miles and pursued my dreams. My life is very slowly coming together and it's all thanks to my sobriety. Any working man knows it can be hard to make the connection between the "job" (quitting) and the payoff (the paycheck) but I'm still collecting every day on the decision to quit and avoiding complacency for me is just remembering that critical connection even if I have to connect the dots myself with a magic marker.
I think some anxiety is appropriate and even healthy.   Two weeks is both absolutely fantastic and also not a very long time.   I'm right there with you and I've been here before...First time I was thrilled with myself and was basically planning a relapse (as they say) a few weeks out.  And that's just what happened...Second time I was anxious like a possibly-imaginary mugger was stalking me.   So I was very cautious.  But after awhile I let my guard slip just for a moment and bang that was it...Third time now and it is freaking Guard Up Twenty Four Seven.  I have had it.  I'm not exactly anxious about the mugger because I know for a FACT he is out there and he will come.   But now I have plans to deal with him...So yes be alert because it's not over.  The anxiety is appropriate.  Having a good plan will keep it in check.   Keep posting.
If more people just took life one day at a time regardless of alcohol people everywhere would be more content. We get so wrapped up in the "what ifs" that we really can't see the awesomeness around us. Just stay focused. Pick up a new hobby that's cheap. Shit sing to some mo-town or blues and pretend you're the baddest mother fucker around. Why not?! I'm proud of you and you're badge too!
