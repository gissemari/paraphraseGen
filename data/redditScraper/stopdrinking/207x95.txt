I spent 4 years in the Army. One of those years (2011) was spent in Afghanistan. To keep it simple I saw a lot of combat lost some friends and did some things I'm not proud of. We killed a lot of people. The majority were bad Taliban dudes but it still didn't sit right with me knowing that they were just doing what I would do if some other country came into my backyard. When I came home I felt lost alienated and all of the other stereotypical things vets feel. I drank hard every weekend. That proceeded into whiskey every night. A little more than 2 years. I got out in January 2013 and moved home to finish up school. Since then I've been drunk every night besides maybe one night a month. I had a great girlfriend for 9 months who eventually realized I was a drunk and not taking the steps I promised her to change. It has been a constant struggle to moderate my drinking for 2 + years. This morning I woke up still drunk with diarrhea none of my school work done and saw on my phone I had drunk texted embarrassing shit to my ex and lots of others. I'm not happy I'm alone and everyday is a foggy hangover. What I'm trying to say is I think I'm finally ready to quit. I wasn't before. The only thing I worry about is the stigma of being a 26 year old veteran non-drinker. I think everyone is going to think "oh that dude saw some shit in afghanistan and must be an recovering alcoholic". But I'm still going to try and quit. I don't care anymore. Alcohol is the most powerful thing I have ever experienced. It has complete control of me. Wish me luck.

As a Vietnam era army veteran I wish you all the best.  ..This worked for me when I stopped drinking and aggressively threw myself into recovery meetings with the same zeal that I did a lot of the things I did in training for my role in my combat unit.  ..Good luck I hope you keep sharing.
When I was quiting my fear and obsesion with alcochol it was. If I go to a restaurant they are going to think this dude does not have money to buy alcohol only sodas. And other is hey that dude cant drink because he does not have the courage and self control to drink 1 shoot. The money part its only fear the auto control its obsesion my body its diferent thats why I cant drink 1 shoot or 1 beer. Today I wake up sober and happy Im me and not the monster at the bottom of the botle.
The VA has some programs which may be able to help with some of the underlying feelings.  And the drinking too though you will find a lot of vets in aa and I suspect smart.
Thank you for your service.  It is really appreciated!..Now...go serve yourself!  Your body is crying out for help physically emotionally and mentally.  Listen to it and go see a professional.  When you do be completely honest.  There are so many people out here just like you and they want to help you help yourself.  Don't worry about what someone *might* think of you in the future.  Think about what your body is asking of you **today**!..Good luck.
To hell with the stigma my embarrassment and all the peripheral shames of not drinking have completely gone away. I find that the shame of being a drunk is so much more powerful than that of a recovering alcoholic. At some point you take pride in being sober and that pride tends to be very apparent to other people...I wish you luck and I wish you strength and perseverance. ..  
Im a 26 year old alcoholic I have been sober for 5 months now. The worst part about alcohol is that it will continue to take things away that are important to you. It has already started obviously with your gf. It gets worse even when you think you have nothing left to lose it will find a way to stab you right in the heart. My problem was driving while intoxicated after I got my 3rd dui I was drinking so much that the weeks blurred together and I lost days at a time and the anxiety and depression was destroying me as well. I would never be able to live with killing an innocent person while im drunk driving so I finally used that as my motivation to find a home at aa. Im not here to tell you to go to aa I think whatever helps you the most is the best option. For the first time in 15 years I feel alive again. I turned a failing semester in school into a 3.0. Im going to graduate in july now and I am going to be signed on at my job once I do. I was lucky enough to have my gf ive been with for 5 years to stay with me. She has been sober with me the entire time. I feel a hell of alot better about myself and life today in sobriety and I will never let alcohol take it from me again. We drink to get away from things but we end up loosing ourselves to alcohol. You seem like an intelligent guy most people ik that are active alcoholics cannot even acknowledge it. You will find that life is a hell of alot better in sobriety and all the things you were running from will suddenly be alot easier to deal with. Good luck to you my friend and thank you for the great service you have provided for me and millions of others.
Another vet here Vietnam 48 years ago. Got out one week before my 21st birhday (enlisted at 17). A few people thought maybe that had something to do with my drinking trying to find an excuse for it. In ***My*** case (may not be true of others) not so I'm a genetic drunk borne this way but - still some thought had to be another reason...Also got sober five years later = do the math 21+5 42 years ago...Welcome I hope to a new better sober life. It's doable..
It makes sense that you attempted to drown the memories in alcohol.  What is amazing is that you are still driven to improve yourself to be a better man by quitting the liquid crutch.  You do deserve it and I hope like hell you succeed...It might not be easy but you can do this.  These first days are going to be emotionally blah at best and just expect this and let it ride.  Stay with it for today and I hope that in a week you will still be clean and then you can talk about a lot of things that drinking has been obscuring...I look forward to more posts from you.  I hope they are from the sober you but if you slip back please still post and stay in contact with us.
Former Marine here. You Army guys are always complaining...Just playing... These things you speak of are real and I know exactly where you are coming from and I know the power of  alcohol. But this is your life... and alcohol is making your problems worse. I was afraid to quit. It hurt the first month. The anxiety and restlessness was almost unbearable. Emotions readjust themselves your  neurological state goes through an adjustment period the fog of apathy slowly dissipates and life becomes more real. Do it. I am rooting for you.
As someone who works at the va with a lot of vets I can tell you you are not alone. A huge number of people I see are alcoholics and have an impossible time dealing with the reality of life after the military. Unfortunately a good percentage never come around and end up begging on street corners holding up their vet ID and a cardboard sign.  Please don't be one of those. The va offers a ton off help in the field of rehab and psychological counseling because so many of their patients are just like you.  Make an appointment.  Get a referral to a psychologist.  Hit up their AA meetings. I've sat in on some of them and they are amazing. It's a group of people who all had the same experiences if not worse(the amputee population has it especially rough) and will share stories that you can relate to. They were your brothers in arms and now many are your brothers in depression and alcoholism. Seek help. Don't go it alone. Good luck!

Good luck and good for you.  Do not concern yourself with whatever others will think.  I'm not a vet so I can only imagine your struggle.  However I am 26 and I've been sober for 3 years.  Alcohol was a crutch a band-aid for me to put over all my issues.  As soon I took my first drink I didn't have to think about my schoolwork or the fact I couldn't get a job or my relationship problems.  You are a strong and capable person when you are sober.  Deal with your problems head on be open and get help from those that truly care about your well-being.
I'm you but: 35 Iraq veteran and at 9+ years instead of 2+. In my experience once most people find out that you "saw some shit" in combat they become the least judging person on the planet. Most of them realize that they can't comprehend what you went through. They likely think that drinking is how they'd handle the results of the shit too. If they have any relatives with PTSD they might just assume you drink excessively anyway like so many of us do...Either way fuck 'em. I haven't quit yet but I'm working on it. Don't wait seven years and become me. Quit for you and fuck those who might judge you. Speaking from experience I'll think you'll be happy that you did.
People probably won't think about you not drinking as much as you think about other people thinking about you not drinking...That said it doesn't really matter what other people think. If you're miserable do something to change it if someone has a problem with that then they are most likely a shitty person.
Welcome! Please don't hesitate to post in the sub - it's a great resource.

I am a veteran as well.  Did a tour each in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as two other tours in non-combat locations supporting those wars.  I was not infantry but I did go outside the wire here and there.  Everyone's experience is different.  For me getting out of the military was actually harder than the tours in the war (which were hard enough).  I did 8.5 years and had no idea what to do on the outside when my military career came to a screeching halt.  I didn't know how to function in civilian society or in my marriage by that point.  ..Just know this...  The booze is not going to make the hardships you face daily any better.  It didn't for me.  The stigma you mention is nothing compared to the embarassment self-defeat and self loathing that booze is causing you on a daily basis.  You will blast past the fear of being stigmatized if you can commit to this thing called sobriety.  If you survived a year in Taliban country you can do this...  You can do anything...Call a VA advisor and see what programs are available to you.  Go to AA.  Post on this sub-reddit.  Use the IRC chat function listed in the right hand column of this page.  And ultimately commit to not drinking tonight.  You can worry about tomorrow tomorrow.   ..And if you ever want to talk to anybody on this page that has an experience similar to yours PM them.  Every one here is cool.

I was worried about what other people would think too. I got sober young (25) and feared having to 'confess' to people that I didn't drink for the same reason - I figured they'd assume it was because I was an alcoholic and pity me. ..However as you've discovered with your ex those closest to you (and probably even acquaintances) probably know more than you realize. When I got sober I thought my friends would judge me or not accept it. Truth was that they all knew exactly what was going on despite my best efforts to hide it. Their reaction was nothing short of "Jesus Christ dude no shit. it's about time." And the people that didn't know me when I was drinking accept the fact that I don't drink much more readily than I ever imagined. If I get the rare "why not?" question it's put to rest with a simple truthful and confident reply of "It's better (for me / for you / for the job / etc or simply 'It's better') if I don't." 99% of the time. ..Shame is a very big part or our psyche when actively drinking. Shame and guilt lead to secrecy and self-loathing. We know we are doing something we don't really want to be doing and don't want others to know about but can't seem to stop. And when we want to stop we are terrified of the idea of living without what has become our crutch and best friend. We often buy into the big lie that life is going to be worse without booze simply out of fear. And for an alcoholic I can guarantee you that life gets better when we stop if we take action in recovery. ..I finally had the courage to face my fear of stopping when the pain of drinking caught up and passed the fear of change. I was still terrified by the idea of getting sober but I was even more frightened by the idea of continuing down the painful path drinking had me on. It sounds like you may be approaching or have reached this point recently. This is what I consider to be hitting bottom - the point where continuing to drink is more painful than the fear of change. ..If you've reached this point the best thing you can do is ask for help and be willing to listen to and accept the advice you're offered. Your post here is the start of that. Every time you ask for help it will be an exercise in overcoming the shame and pride that active alcoholism has built up in you but getting honest with others will get you honest with yourself and that's the best tool you have in beating this thing. ..Next I would suggest talking to a doctor about your drinking and desire to stop so they can best advise you on an appropriate course of action. Alcohol withdrawal for the daily hard drinker is a very unpleasant hurdle at best and medically dangerous at worst. The key is to be honest and willing to take their advice. As a veteran the VA deals with this all the time and has very substantial detox and recovery programs in place. I hear it all the time from other sober alcoholics. You're far from the first one your doctor has heard from about this. And although it doesn't feel like it right now seeking help to better yourself is the least shameful thing you can do. We aren't bad people trying to get good we are sick people trying to get well. ..From there your best continuing source of support advice compassion and hope will be gained from reaching out to other sober alcoholics. People who drank like you felt like you acted like you and thought like you but who have managed to put down the booze and start living a sober and rewarding life. People you can relate to and look up to. Find them listen to them confide in them ask them for help when you struggle. I guarantee in doing so you're helping them stay sober as much as you're getting helped yourself. This subreddit is a good secondary source for me but the single best place I've found to find people who can help me in this way is at AA meetings. Regardless of your preconceptions or aversions to 'the program' (and trust me I had them in spades) it's where I found the *people* I needed to meet to help me on my journey. If you're willing to seek them out and listen with some open-mindedness you'll receive hope and good practical advice you won't find anywhere else. Psychologists and counselor and doctors and self help books all have their place in healing but nothing gets through the mental roadblocks we set up like talking to someone you can relate to on a personal level... If you look for ways to relate to the similarities and reasons to stay instead of superficial differences and reasons to leave I promise you'll find real human connections that will save your ass on this journey. ..Of course as I said every step of the way will be a struggle against your comfort zone. But you need to get outside of your comfort zone if you want to get sober and start to recover from untreated alcoholism. Because your comfort zone is booze and your comfort zone will make you miserable and lead your right back to it. ..If you want something you've never had you're going to have to do things you've never done to get it. ..I wish you the best. If you want to get sober you can and there are lots of people who want nothing more than to help you on your journey if you seek them out. 
I was 26 when I started recovery. I am also an Army vet and relatively young being 30. Recovery meetings is the only thing that worked for me. I tried everything trust me. If you need any help PM me. .
Good luck from another 11b with a lot of combat and a very similar story but in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Stay strong. You can do it it gets easier with time I was in the same position you were and got through it. Just don't hate yourself or be angry with yourself if you slip up a little just get back on that horse and continue on. Find a hobby it helps. Remember the Iraqi and Afghani Turkish royal cigarettes that we all would be disgusted by? The unfiltered ones that smelled like ass. Well after a while the smell of alcohol started to garner a similar reaction from me. :) You got this!
No lie the first month is probably going to be one of the hardest things that you ever do. It was hard for me not only because of withdrawals and jacked up sleep but because all of the things I wasn't dealing with in my head I had to start dealing with. I didn't have my "normal" way of dealing with it anymore. Counseling therapy talking to understanding friends and AA helped. You won't feel like that forever...It was also hard I knew that I could just have some beers and all that would stop - for the night. That didn't make things go away it just made me able to bury them... until that stopped working too...I'm sure I've been lucky that friends and family are respecting my decisions but it really was the only way out that left me alive on the other side - so screw the stigma. We've all dealt with stigma before. You're taking the path that requires the most courage.

Fellow vet here you might want to look into [Dryhootch](http://dryhootch.org/) for support as well...Keep up the fight brother.
From a veteran to another veteran I know you can do this and fuck the stigma. Believe in your living a better life and find a way to leave the past in the past as hard as it might be. I'm here for you brother and PM if you need to get some shit off your chest.
good luck!
Former 11B here never saw combat was non-deployable due to breaking my back. Don't worry what people think. Being a recovering alcoholic is nothing to be ashamed of. I think that will find that a lot more people will supportive than look down on you. But such is life what matters is that you can hold your head high. 
Oh and just a side note of the co-founders of AA was a combat vet from WWI.
Welcome! There have been some excellent posts recently about advice for when you first quit. Not drinking pretty much trumps all for the first 30 days.
You've made the right decision. The best time to start is five years ago the second best is now. ..I also would like to mention that I think that rather than being a stigma being a 26 year old veteran non-drinker means to me you are dealing with the shit you saw rather than trying to escape it. It's the alcoholics that carry the stigma and it's because they are running from their problems and in the process creating more. ..You aren't doing that man. And for that I'm so proud of you.
I'm not a veteran but I'm 24 no matter what u are if your young and u don't drink people are from time to time going to give u a hard time. It gets easier to take. What made it easier to me is to see how the other half lives through sober eyes. Once I saw what a drunk looks like while sober it changed my perspective. Best of luck to you. 
I hope you find all the peace and validation from the world that you seemed to be reaching for in your texts though by staying sober you'll get it all with dignity respect and a fellowship of people who have found a great way to live. I really hope the best for you. I identify with you very much. If you can find the strength to make the leap walk through the door and keep the patience to watch your life change watch yourself change gradually I hope that you can benefit very much from sobriety being in touch with your emotions and truly living life on life's terms. If you stay sober you will look at yourself in the mirror in one year and see a better you I guarantee it.
