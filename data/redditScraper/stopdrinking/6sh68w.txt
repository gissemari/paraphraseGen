In the last few days I've been struggling with the idea that I have a problem. Today I've realized and accepted that I struggle with a disease and reached out and made an appointment. As someone with underlying depression and anxiety I'm immediately feeling anxious and regret when I know I have issues I need to deal with. ..What are some tips or ways you all go about crawling out of your own head in order to stay out of trouble and keep sober especially when you don't necessarily have a support system behind you?

I really like AA that can be a great support system if you are at all into that! Some folks aren't though just staying busy video games guitar exercise whatever you like to do! 
Glad you're here!  I had to get a support network...I finally realized that it wasn't *lack of willpower* as my issue but rather *Lack of In Real Life Support*.  That's all I needed!..I went to meetings and immediately found people who understood what I was experiencing.  I got tools resources support and fellowship to first stop drinking and then to live sober...Now I just forgo ONE drink today - The First One..Never been happier!
