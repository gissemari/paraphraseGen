It's been a really tough week. Every time I think I can't feel any worse something else decides it wants to shit on my desk...I came so close within seconds of pouring a huge whiskey. But somehow I stopped myself. That desire to blot everything out just for a few hours is so strong even after all this time. ..I am struggling especially with that desire to switch off for awhile. ..Still sober. At least sober my thought processes have been healthy.

Great that you didn't drink and stayed on course you  are doing awesome. I've had a few times where I had a case of the 'fuck its' but was so glad the next day that I didn't. IWNDWYT
Congratulations on staying strong! Keep going!
Having fell of the wagon a lot of times all I can say is it's crap. You think you're missing something but you're not. The first beer is ok then it feels shit then you have a crap sleep then you wake up with a crappy hangover and think meh...that wasn't so great!
It's tough but just know that it'll pass.  You've been able to make it thus far and you're better off for it.  For me personally I try to remember that I've never once regretted NOT drinking.  But I almost always regret drinking.  Stay strong!
 I had a tough time at first with wanting the relief of shutting off my brain as well. It took a while for me to find ways to replace that escape with something positive. Now I drink a cup of tea while reading a book or watch ASMR videos or meditate tend my garden walk my pup or do yoga. Great job not pouring that drink. Iwndwyt
