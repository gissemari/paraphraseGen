Life is good. That is all. :)..Edit to say: Thank you all! You're all wonderful people. To those still struggling: I know you've heard it before but it really does get better. It gets a LOT better...Don't give up. And when you've won you can always look back and say: "I beat this. Look at what I've accomplished!" ..Take pride in knowing you can do amazing things. No. Not just amazing things... you can perform miracles.
