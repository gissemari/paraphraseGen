This is my first night in months where I haven't had a drink with my night-time medicine. ..I don't know how it got to this point exactly but every single night I've been mixing a drink a couple extra doses of my Klonopin and extra Benadryl to get to sleep at night. I did this to basically 'sedate' myself so I wouldn't self-harm since that was getting really bad. Then the alcohol just slipped right in and is now my first thought of how to cope instead of cutting. ..I'm in therapy. I'm working on it. Tonight is a struggle without that drink so much so that I want to cry and hurt myself \[as this is what drinking replaced\] but I can't do this forever. I'm trying to stop this habit early. I'm just about to turn 22. It is hard managing the drinking culture of college with this but I am going to try. This is the first night. ..Wish me luck as I do for all of you. IWNDWYT

Quitting drinking was the best decision I ever made. I wish I had your wisdom at that age. Hang in there.     .    .Ps. Be extremely careful with the benzos...they are a slippery slope and have withdrawal that can last *years*.
Seeing the problem even when it's a "help" in replacing another bad thing and not defending drinking tooth and nail by trying to convincing others and yourself that it's not a problem all that at that age - this is really. fucking. strong. I wish I had been able to do when i was that young...My highest respect. You can do this and you'll get over some nights with little sleep...I will not drink with you today either!.
