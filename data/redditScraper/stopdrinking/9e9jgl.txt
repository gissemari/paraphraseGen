Just home from my first sober wedding (&amp; celebrating 250 days sober).  It's 3am here at the moment so I managed a good 12 hour stint pretty impressive if I do say so myself :)   ...I can actually honestly say that I had as much fun at this wedding as at the last wedding I attended where I was relatively intoxicated.  Except tomorrow I will wake up feeling tired yes but not like vomiting all over myself for the whole day in a shame spiral about what I said to who or what I did.  A few people did get a bit tedious towards the end repeating the same shit over and over but generally most that I spoke to were brilliant fun and seemed to be in awe of my sobriety which is always affirming.    ...Some other recent posters have commented how this subreddit has too much of the sunshine and lollipops side of sobriety but in saying the above I want to caveat it with the honest truth that I have struggled a lot over the past number of months with my sobriety feeling isolated anxious lonely and sad.  However days like today really help cement the fact that I am supposed to be sober longterm and I am well able for it.   ..&amp;#x200B;..Side note: I am finally going into therapy for aforementioned feelings.  They wax and wane but definitely won't go away forever unless I get help.  I'm glad I have finally realised that now :)   ...xx

&lt;golf claps&gt; Well played!  I'm relatively cheerful that you are experiencing something akin to awesomeness at your new sober super powers!  Good for you you've earned it this happiness.  It seems to be a natural by product of enjoying life   
I'm going to my first wedding while sober on November 17th....my own.
