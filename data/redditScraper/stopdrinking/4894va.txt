Been binge watching burn notice lately and sam is always drinking making the same bad alcoholic jokes i used to make. I kept thinking "just a six pack wouldnt hurt." but i reminded myself that a six pack wouldnt be enough and id have to walk back to the gas station for more. If i had gone id be drinking till 4am when i have to get up at 9 to move across the country. ..Worst part is i even started planning to buy some liquor for the road trip (im not driving at all). ..Glad i thought it out and controlled my addiction. Im considering giving my license to some friends out there so if i get an urge to drink i physically cant buy any. Im not going to have my car for at least 2 months out there so i dont really need it anyway.

Phew!  Glad to hear you managed to resist the urge.  It would be a pity to lose your one week badge....And giving your licence to your friends sounds like a good idea.  Belt and braces!...You've done that hardest bit.  Stick with it!  x
.Well close call! ..I'm just pondering the bit about the license I'm thinking of the misc cases that require ID maybe when you get to your destination visit some govt offices and apply for a non-driver ID to at least separate the issues. ..Not having a license of any kind on you could be fine for days then a Murphy's Law scenario shows up. ..
