Officially six months alcohol free. Wow... Just Wow... I wish I could post a really long detailed explanation on exactly how I'm doing it and all the millions of ways my life has improved. But I'm not going to do that today... I'm just here to kind of toot my own horn (*tooooot toot*) and say a quick thank you to all of you here at SD. Especially those of you that have been struggling but keep getting back up and trying harder than ever. You inspire me to keep up my streak and stay in control. Without this sub I really don't think I would be where I am here at 6 months... So Thank You. More than I'm sure any of you know you've all helped me tremendously...I love you guys and gals. ..I'm not drinking today!

Brag about it as much as you can! It's a hell of an accomplishment and I appreciate what it took to get where you are. I hope to be joining your club in the near future! 
Congrats on the 6 months. That's huge. 
Tooooot Toot!!! I like the sound of that horn....tooooooot away! Congrats on 6 months great job! :)
6 months is a big milestone.  Hopefully you'll breeze the next 6! Congratulations sober stranger.  :)
Nice work. You've earned all the tooting you want. ..I'm 5 months tomorrow and thrilled about it. So many years of going back and forth and back and forth and ... I had started to think it would either always be that way or just kill me slow or maybe fast. ..Being sober is really nice even once the novelty and pink cloud wears off. 
Toot Toot! Aaaawooooohgahhhh! 
Well done that is a hell of an achievement!  Half a year of health in the books.
