Well in true relapse fashion.....I am here AGAIN. I had a good run of over two months sober. I am quite proud of myself! Wellhubby and I went Las Vegas last week for our 21st Anniversary :) We had a lot of fun. We did have wine with dinner and a cocktail here and there. At no time were we hammered. We actually did some hiking and visited the Hoover Dam :) I have requested a badge reset. I am sad to see my number 2 star go but I am also proud of myself. I never got drunk......never made a fool out of myself.......never blacked out :) But now back to reality because at anytime I could not be able to control it! The demon will always be there! I will not drink with you today :)
