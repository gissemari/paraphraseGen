I woke up in severe panic and shock. I am a bit broken.

How did it start?
Still here though.   
Now that you've relapsed you can take the knowledge of what triggers you to drink and make yourself more resilient in the future. .I know you can be sober. I believe in you just as I believe in me.
But you're here ! Good job   
Stay strong relapses happen. Plan for the next one now so that you have s system and supports in place to prevent it again. That's a win - win. .
