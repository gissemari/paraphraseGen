Day one done. 15 beers every few nights is not only irresponsible but is destroying my life. I struggle with moderating how much I drink and it's time to give it up for good.

Welcome! Here's the [blueprint] (https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) that myself and a lot of others have followed to stay away from drinking. 
Excellent. Welcome! We're glad you're here.
You can do this. And congrats on Day 1. The first day is usually pretty hard for sure. Good job and welcome! 
Had my last bender Friday night. Sunday night I sat in bed and accepted that I am out of control and circling down the drain of hopeless despair and rock bottom misery. I started surfing the internet and found some blogs on sobriety. By the time I went to sleep I was experiencing a calmness I had not felt in a long time. I just gave in and accepted that I had to stop period and that I was never going to be able to moderate my drinking. Today work was hell and I struggled with the usual "I need a drink" but said FUCK NO you will regret it. So day 3 down. Good luck to you fellow newcomer. It feels really good right now I hope you feel the same.
You're making a brave and good choice. Welcome!
