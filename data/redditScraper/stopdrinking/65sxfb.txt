Hi everyone I'm working on day 3 and just need to post to make me more accountable. I struggle with sustaining sobriety and really want to make it one week. The NBA playoffs are on and my brain is asking me 'come on what's one beer?' I don't know if I can make it the week so I'm just really trying to make it tonight. I just bought some ice cream to quell the sugar cravings I get during sobriety. ..I will eat ice cream (and not drink) with you all tonight.

Get some fake beer if it gets really bad.

Of course you can! You've come here and we believe in you. You're almost halfway there which means that whatever you're doing is working!
Congratulations on day three. Staying sober for the first week was the biggest obstacle for me. When I first wanted to get sober i could never make it past 4 days it just didn't happen. I wasn't so great at holding myself accountable. I sure thought I was but the proof was in my results. It changed when I started going to AA meetings and making sober friends there. Having a group of people to support me and me supporting them is the reason I've been sober for four months. Enjoy your ice cream :))
