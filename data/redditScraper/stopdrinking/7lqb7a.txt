2 years ago right after Christmas morning my girlfriend broke up with me. Found a keeper two months after but alcohol ruined that too. She broke it off the next Christmas morning after a promise ring was given to her.. I'm an alcoholic/addict and finished two inpatient treatment programs.. worst thing of all though is I've been doing so well with a new career and this (so called life) but this time of year is making me relapse. I don't (need) advice but I'd appreciate anything. Merry Christmas all

This year (and every moment) is an opportunity to forge new memories write new pathways in your brain.  Doesn't mean you'll take the opportunity.  You can always reinforce the existing pathways by retracing them...
Yeah these are trying times. My way out of a vicious cycle of grief and depression was to claim it for myself; insist with clenched fists and grinding teeth that I have the right to do what I want regardless of family and friends. Then I made an effort to break the patterns that ended up in drunken misery. Step by step I'm getting over my sorrows...I'm not saying it's a quick fix. It sucks. It's hard work. But it's possible. I guess I'm just saying that I feel you buddy...I will not drink with you today!
I like to think I'm a stubborn SOB and no one can make me do anything.  Grr.       
Seems like when things dramatic happen on holidays we never forget that something and always tie the drama to the day . For me I've been trying to make each year a new year . Not skipping putting up the tree or cooking a turkey are my rules to moving forward . New happy memories are out there to be made if we don't run away.
