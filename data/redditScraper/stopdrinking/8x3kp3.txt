Kinda snuck up on me. I was at a wedding last night and noticed '7/7/18' on a bit of swag they were handing out to guests. My quit date is 1/7/17 (and 7 is my favorite number) so I thought "Wait... has it been.."..And sure enough 18 months in the bag  . I posted here around 90-100 days sober when I was at another wedding and struggling. Since then that couple has had a baby. I guess time really does fly...Just here to offer hope to everyone out there. 7 days used to seem impossible - and it's not  ..Looking forward to many more years and experiencing all the things I couldn't without being sober.
