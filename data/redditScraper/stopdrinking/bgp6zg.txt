Honestly I'm not upset. I wanted to learn how to responsibly handle alcohol...I had a glass of red wine and honestly it tasted bad. I didn't enjoy it and I got a headache...This whole time I thought I was missing out!!..I'm not going to start over my counter. I'm going to continue and say  I had one drink in X amount of days. ..For everyone struggling including myself it's not worth it. ..IWNDWYT (last T stands for tomorrow this time) :) ..Much love.

Good for you! I notice a lot of people beat themselves up on this sub for having a drink or even a non alcoholic beverage and I probably would do the same.  I have been considering a drink or two once a month but can't justify it after drinking a lot for 14 years. But you're right it probably will taste awful and not worth it.
No it's ok. There are so many posts here like this. You did it you can't change it and hating yourself  because of it makes you vulnerable. All that happened is that you learned something. ..Good. Put that learning in the bank and move on one day at a time. It does get easier as the habit of not drinking gathers strength. Have a great day!
