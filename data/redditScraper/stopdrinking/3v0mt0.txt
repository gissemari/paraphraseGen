I really don't expect you to read this but typing it out helps me get my arms around it...**Shame**.I am filled with shame today. Here I am in my early 30's but because of my drinking unable to drive. I need to rely on my wife / immediate family to cart me around like I'm in middle school. Against all odds I've managed to obtain and hold on to a great job (great in terms both satisfaction and compensation) but I need to be dropped off each morning and picked up each evening. The embarrassment and stress I feel because of that is almost insurmountable. I was asked to sit on the board of a service organization for which I had to decline due to "personal reasons" and a racking sense of shame. I was hoping I could do some real good there but how can I help others when I can't even help myself?..**Stress**.My level of stress is now physically manifesting itself in my body. Stress at work is no more than usual in fact I'd estimate it's a healthy level of stress required for meeting deadlines and deliverables. Combined with my status in recovery however it's getting to be a real problem. I find myself hiding in an office door locked crying in a very "unmanly" type of way. The stress and strain on my marriage is showing as well as my wife sure doesn't enjoy driving Mr. Alcoholic around every single day. If I quit work the strain on my wife to attempt to keep us financially afloat would skyrocket not to mention it wouldn't even be financially viable (wife makes $N household minimum = $Nx6). .. .**Depression**.I was normally a very active member in my community. I volunteered weekly and enjoyed both the feeling it gave me and the feeling it gave those I served. I never ask my wife to transport me to anything other than work treatment and court. That leaves out service work and hobbies (which in some cases co-aligned luckily) and has me in a heighten state of loneliness. If I ask my wife to accommodate that the anger goes up meaning the A and the L in H.A.L.T. are currently on a balance beam with each other. So I go from home to work to AA meetings to home. When I'm at home the depression and loneliness can be almost crushing. When I get emails from people that say "Hey we missed you at the Red Cross hope to see you back soon" the shame and depression make me shake...**Hopelessness**."There are no losers in AA only slow winners" Is that really true? Is recovery a vehicle for elevation or is it merely stopgap for continued destruction? Let me be clear I'd rather live handicapped yet in recovery over continued destruction but I'm also not okay with lying to myself. Right now recovery feels like a tourniquet. My addiction started the bleeding recovery is going to keep me alive but I'm going to lose that limb. One day at a time. One day at a time? The second habit of highly effective people is to "Begin with End in Mind". One cannot do that living one day at a time. Right now I feel the indoctrination of recovery is to simply sieve the bleeding then convince me I'm okay with one leg. If that is the case fine just fucking say it but don't string me along with the hope of promises beyond "you won't kill someone or yourself drunk driving". We aren't all Andy fucking Dufresne here. I guess I should have called the section hopelessness / anger...Today is a hard day maybe the hardest day thus far. I won't drink today but I can't say that is of my own recognizance. The courts have their hands around my neck in a fairly snug fashion. Maybe this is just a phase of recovery the step of the grief cycle where I mourn my old ways. Who knows. All I know is right now my hands are shaking and typing is a challenge at best.

I read it. Sorry things are crappy. Understanding that recovery doesn't mean every day is sunshine and rainbows is something I am also struggling with. Also not being able to use alcohol to silence my emotions into submission is tough - I do NOT like dealing w/ all of these emotions sometimes. I'm glad you posted though. Don't give up. I've found i'm stronger than I think and I bet you are too. ..stay strong friend.
I know all of those feelings very well but one thing that I do know is that picking up a drink right now for me would mean that all of those feelings would just compound on each other and bring me down even more. You can stay sober today. God willing so will I.

I'm only at 10 days so I am not really in a position to give advice but I've been told that for at least the first 100 days you need to be really really gentle with yourself and you are going to feel very fragile. You are recovering from the physical abuse of your body at the same tome as learning to deal with all the emotional stuff in more healthy ways. no wonder you are feeling so rough when you've not only lost drinking as an outlet but also all your other hobbies interests and contacts. Would you be able to get a lift somewhere from someone else? Or agree with your wife to drive you once a week? Sorry things are so shitty for you right now.
I read it.  Thanks for your honestly.  You're in a hard place but you can take victory knowing you're doing what's right.  Better to be sober with these problems than drunk.  
I don't have any words of wisdom but I just want you to know I read your post and empathize.
For me at 78 days it was a slog.  In fact I'm not sure I even began to nose up until I was 4 or 5 months along but like you I recognized that no matter how bad I felt adding alcohol would only make it worse.  When I started to feel better I was so grateful that I was able to hang on because I really did start to feel better and life started to fill up with hopeful signs even though I was still dealing with consequences.
Recovery is rough but I believe what they tell me in AA about things getting better the promises etc. Sometimes I also question whether things will actually get better or if I'm being strung along and then I start to feel like I'm losing it but I trust my sponsor and the people I've met and talked to. Hang in there I'm right there with you.. 
Thanks everyone. At least knowing that others have felt even parts of this as well is a burden off my shoulders. I appreciate everyone posting. I couldn't get to a meeting today which is not something I'm happy about but that's why I love this sub - pocket AA 24/7
The first few months of not drinking are the hardest as you probably suspect. The long-term benefits may not be showing up--yet--and the costs are apparent every day from cravings to shame over past behavior and current circumstances. This whole change is at least greatly humbling. And it can be hard to see where it goes. Hang in there. It really does get better.
