But today I am not. I've had a headache all day been nauseous & whiny & have generally just wasted a perfectly lovely holiday on woe.  I just feel overwhelmed with sadness & self-loathing & that is out of character for me.  Instead of drinking I want to post here to remind myself that all is not lost over one grumpy day. There are two previous perfect little boys asleep just down the hall & another amazing young man shooting fireworks with his dad right now. To think that these amazing people call me Mom lights up my whole world. Snoring peacefully in the recliner in the den there is a man who loves me so much that he volunteered to give up alcohol & make our home a dry one. He has never struggled with addiction & yet he supports me.  My name is tattooed in big bold letters across his forearm surrounded by pink roses just like the ones on the rose bush in front of our home. When I think of all of these lovely things I remember that I am very blessed & I feel silly for letting the small things get me down.  If you are feeling down tonight I am sending you good vibes & prayers for positivity. You are strong & can weather any storm. Thanks for reading.

Hey thanks. And good vibes to you too. :)
This was a lovely post. Sending you an Internet hug.
I had a sad day also.  This time of year is hard for me.  I didn't have any BBQs etc to go to &amp; I have to go to work early tomorrow.  I am home with my family but feeling sorry for myself that I don't have sober friends to celebrate the fourth with.  Oh well my family with me is sober and I know friends will come.  I'm still working on being the best sober me I can be.  Sorry you were down today also but hay were sober!  And that's awesome!
I have tears now and I thank you for sharing your thoughts. 
I don't know you or your economic situation but what you've described your homelife and your appreciation I know you are rich indeed. ..Thanks for sharing.
