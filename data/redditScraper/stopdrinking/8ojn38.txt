Wanted to share this quick story:..Social media has a lot of flaws from allowing people to bully others from the safety of behind their computer screens to giving those of us who struggle with alcohol constant reminders that there are people in the world who can enjoy just a drink or two and look like they're having so much fun doing so. But I wanted to share how social media actually helped me in a surprising way...A friend I knew in college (we graduated 11 years ago and I haven't seen her since then) found me on Instagram and we started reconnecting. In the past year I've lost my mom my sweet dog and broken my ankle and four years before that I lost my dad. Being an only child I have felt alone for a long time and was using drinking as a way to forget how sad I was. This friend doesn't know about the drinking but when she found out about my losses she said she was sending me something in the mail. ..It arrived today and it's a lovely simple silver bracelet with the words  one day at a time' engraved on it. There's no way she could have known that's the phrase I tell myself daily when I'm struggling. I immediately put it on and it will be a physical everyday reminder when I'm tempted that I can do this - one day at a time. I'm on day 23 - the longest I can remember going without a drink in over a decade and I am so proud of myself. The bracelet is also an affirmation I'm on the right path finally. I can't wait to take my friend out for lemonade and thank her in person. ..Happy Monday (or whatever day it is where you are) all and IWNDWYT.
