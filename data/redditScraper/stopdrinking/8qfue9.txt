Been a long time reader of this sub gone through a few good periods of sobriety and more than a few relapses. Suppose it is the nature of the beast; not quite sure hence the post...I'm a bartender; I've made it my career. I have successfully been able to stay sober at after hours parties tasting events etc. which I am supremely proud of myself for being able to do as those have absolutely been triggers for me. ..Have a few certifications already mainly in the Cicerone and Sommelier areas but here's my question:..Part of the Certified Sommelier test is a blind tasting. You absolutely must drink wine in order to pass this test. Has anyone been able to do this without actually triggering themselves into a regression?..I can not advance in my career without this at this point but do not want to fall back down the proverbial rabbit hole. Any help/suggestions would be appreciated.

Maybe you need to find a new career...Look I'm not trying to beat you up morally and I'm sure you don't want to hurt anyone. BUT...  you're asking for advice on how to avoid succumbing to an addiction... while enabling other addicts and while surrounding yourself with other addicts and your substance of choice...Like I said I'm not judging or calling you an evil or selfish person. Every time I left a bar while very drunk I never ever thought "You know what fuck all these people on the road. I don't care if I kill them." If that happened... I don't want to think about it...Sometimes you have to do things that are unpleasant or undignified to pay the bills. But in that environment you will eventually give in and at first it may be a drink a few times a week but it will escalate...Anyways it's your life. Just be aware of what's really happening. Good luck.
What does life look like for you after the tasting? My old roommate had a shitload of wine certs a ton of acronyms I don't remember. He occasionally took a month off but couldn't stop altogether because he ran the wine program at work. There were class tastings rep tastings the all day affairs from pioneer or republic where everyone got so drunk they couldn't even taste the shit anymore. What you have in front of you is a decision to make. Does your job and career require future drinking? Will not drinking make you resent it? Say you get poured a tiny bit for a tasting will you be grumpy that it's a few drops rather than a larger splash since it's  technically  not cheating/not relapsing because it's for work? this is a decision only you can make. I work in a bar sometimes and while it is hard it would be doubly hard if I had to deal with that choice. Whatever you choose know that this community is always here for you if you want it. IWNDWYT or tomorrow.
