I see in the rules that links are not allowed. I am relatively new to sobriety and I made a YouTube channel that focuses on helping others through the beginning stages of thinking about getting sober and the steps and methods I used to help myself. I would like to share it here if it is allowed if not that's ok too. I promise I'm not trolling anybody or looking for contributions I just want to be one alcoholic to another and try to help others that struggle as I did. Thanks and take care!
