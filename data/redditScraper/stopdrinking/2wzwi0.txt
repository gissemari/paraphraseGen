It was weird I've had tons of relapse dreams but never a sobriety dream. I was with friends at the bar district and we went to a show. Then afterwards we started bar hopping. In my dream I just watched everyone else get wasted. I never even had the thought to not drink I just didn't do it. There was also this huge thunderstorm in the dream. We got stuck in one of the bars and people were trying to make a run for their cars and getting struck by lightning while my friends and I just waited it out. Not sure if that has any importance. Oh well just felt like telling you guys this. Thanks for reading.

I like sobriety dreams SO much better than drinking dreams. Glad you avoided the lightening too!
