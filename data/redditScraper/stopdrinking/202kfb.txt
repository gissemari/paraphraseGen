This [Book?](http://www.amazon.com/Racing-Recovery-From-Addict-Ironman/dp/189136961X)
[Boo ya](http://books.google.com/books?id=I8hbtAHgYY4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Finding+Ultra-+Rich+Roll&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PSQeU_XoLcH1oASUnIKQBA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Finding%20Ultra-%20Rich%20Roll&amp;f=false)..I remembered because I think it happened on a post I made about being bored.
I think you're thinking of [Running Ransom Road](http://www.amazon.com/Running-Ransom-Road-Confronting-Marathon/dp/0544105435/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394513140&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=running+ransom+road).
