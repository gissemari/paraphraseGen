I have been struggling. I go one two three days without drinking and then I have one or two and the next night I'm back at it. I want to be free of this. I want to be done with this. .Last night my husband went to a friends house so I got tanked after the kids were asleep. As I was getting ready for bed I realized if there was an emergency right then I would be useless. My kids would not have the protection they deserved. .I want a healthy life and so badly to be the best role model I can be for these precious children of mine..I'm resetting my badge this morning. For the tenth time. I have quit before. I know I can do it. So WHYYYY do I keep making the stupid decision to drink?!.I think I need to go back to AA.

You can do it!! ..Meetings really supported me.
Go for it! AA has been a critical part of my recovery. 
Something that really helped me was reading "This Naked Mind" - it really helps answer that very question:  Why do I keep making that decision to drink. Thinking  One day at a time is helpful too.
I hear you. Feeling the same way. have had the same thoughts about my kids. Trying again trying to commit....let's do this together. I will not drink with you today!
Congrats on 8 days.  I agree it is a matter of deciding.  I've had a few badge resets of this 9 months and now I know I don't do moderation so I can forget it.  Did you read This Naked Mind?   Free download in the sidebar.  I'm not drinking with you today.
