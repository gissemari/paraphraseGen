11 days and still struggling with not being able to sleep. Gggrrrrr..On a positive note I'm grateful for another sober weekend. .I'm also glad I read others' thoughts on "drunk brain"  .My husband told me not to be too hard on myself and that I am a wonderful wife and mother sober or not. .My mind starts thinking maybe I wasn't so bad when I was drinking. Maybe I could just have a few on the weekends maybe....NO! It's not possible right now. One drink will lead to several and one day of drinking will lead to a weekend which will lead to every damn day again. No thank you very much.

Congrats on 11 days! If melatonin doesn't work for you I find that when I really need to sleep Benadryl works like a charm for me. It is the active ingredient in OTC sleep aids tylenol PM etc. I'm only on day 6 this time around and having the same issue hoping it passes soon! I'll take insomnia over a hangover any day though.
Readjusting to a normal sleep schedule is awful. I once bargained myself into just few shots right before bed to help me sleep. Well I ended up in bender town. ..Only a few days in to sobriety now and dealing with that insomnia. I feel ya! Sending good vibes!
I'm on the insomnia train with you but at least we're not drinking. Not right now and not tomorrow either :)..Going to try a Benadryl. Allergies acting up anyway
Yup - really struggled this last week - but last night I put my head down and just drifted off...Sure you're not far off from the same!
I think alcoholism has destroyed my sleeping schedule. I'm 49 and I will catch myself looking at the clock wondering if it is time to go to bed yet. Weekdays I rarely make it to 9pm last night it was 7:45 and I was brushing my teeth. (615 days.)
