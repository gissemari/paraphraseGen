Please be aware: /r/stopdrinking is a great place to get support but only a doctor can give you medical advice. If you are experiencing acute or persistent physical or psychological symptoms (including withdrawal) please contact a medical professional immediately...Please also be aware we request that if you have been drinking you lurk rather than post. There's lots of information in the sidebar including the FAQs and [information on withdrawals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index#wiki_alcohol_withdrawal).
