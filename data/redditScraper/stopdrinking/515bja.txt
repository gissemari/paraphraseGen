So today is day 8 for me and I'm no stranger to this.  Drinking was never really my thing until I was about 20 heading for 21. From then until about 24 I was pretty much a mess. I moved from my parents home at 21 to Nebraska which was quite the change of pace. Was lonely here and drinking seemed to satisfy that. Two years ago my HR woman took me to a place called Valley Hope where I spent 30 days (by choice. I wanted to leave after a few days but chose to stick it out). Came back and everything was okay. The girl I was seeing left which worked out because she wasn't helping anything and I had two children. I'm with the mother of them but have come to realize in sobriety that I can't really stand her. My mind is complex and I like having deep conversations that challenge me and she is the complete opposite. She would rather tell me about the Kardashians and other junk. I'm 26 and it's been a bumpy ride but this subreddit really clicks with me and I'm here everyday. Glad I found you all! This feels like only the second time I've given sobriety a chance because well I really didn't want to. At all. So much work trying to hide the drinking and mental planning drove me insane. I kept messaging girls I had no interest in because I wanted the satisfaction of knowing I was wanted. I craved it. Almost worst than the drinking. The past week has been a roller coaster of emotions. I'm angry on edge my anxiety is out the roof and I can't shake it. I go on a drive and just blare music to just zone out for a bit. That helps. The girlfriend is getting irritated a lot lately now because I'm on here and focusing on myself listening to podcasts about stopping the drinking and just doing anything I can to not drink. She feels like all my time needs to be dedicated on her which by my calculations every time I do that and put myself last I relapse. Not this time. Sorry this was so long and thank you all for reading. Today I will not drink with you all. I've got coffee calling my name. Much love to you all!..                                                                Sean.

It sounds selfish but one thing I I've learned in recovery is that I need to put my recovery first. Without sobriety I can't take care of myself and I'm not present in my life enough to be much use to anybody. I've gotten a lot out of seeing a therapist and going to support groups - both have helped me understand and deal with my feelings and life in general. ..It's totally normal to have some roller coaster emotions in early sobriety. As far as your girlfriend goes it sounds like you've not been totally committed to the relationship. It's a little understandable that she might be feeling threatened by this new focus of attention. I've found that it can take a lot of sober time to rebuild relationships and rebuild trust...Thanks for posting and keep rocking - you're doing great!
