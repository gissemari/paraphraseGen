This is my first official post here ever (after lurking for a few months) so I'm giving a little backstory for my own sense of thorough completion I guess. I've been struggling with whether or not I actually want to be sober for about 14 years now which I realize is a completely bullshit way to live. Like many of you have discussed I also got into AA back in '03-'05 and never felt like I fit in because I absolutely don't fit the requirements for having the disease of alcoholism. So then I wasted a lot of time debating whether or not I had this disease or just had a drinking problem instead of looking at the fact that I have no self control when I start drinking and that that's the real issue - not the semantics. However to be fair I have no moderation with *anything* in my life (food love drinking consuming media you name it) so who's to say I'm strictly an alcoholic? ..Anyway *also* like many of you I have never had any real consequences to my drinking and because of a hormonal disorder I've been grappling with since I was 12-13-ish I've been relatively isolated in my lifestyle in the last few years depending solely on my husband for financial support (which makes me haaate myself) and a great deal on social media for a social life (which also makes me haaate myself.) For me drinking was never a social thing and it was never something I "had" to do; it was often the bright spot of my otherwise lonely day and the relief from my obsessively-chattering brain that wreaked havoc on my sense of self when my hormones were in flux every month. To this day alcohol is something I thoroughly enjoy and am nowhere near hitting rock bottom with. I don't drink daily and I'm not facing an ultimatum that I need to change...HOWEVER I'm finally getting these hormonal issues sorted and my life is finally turning around in a way I've only dreamed about for the last decade since things started getting worse. My productivity is better than it has been since I was in high school (late-90's-early-Aughts) and I'm clear-headed and motivated enough to get out of bed every day all day like a normal person. It's amazing. ..But this shift in my life has somehow caused me to start drinking really heavily probably from the fear I'm having of emerging from my house and back into the world and all the changes that I'm undergoing. I went from binge-drinking once a week (still obviously problematic) to drinking every single day for a couple weeks before I realized what I was doing and how I'm actively creating a new obstacle for myself when I'm finally getting rid of another one. I've been waiting 20 years to feel consistently better; what the hell am I so afraid of and why am I trying to damper this moment with more booze?..I have had more Day 1s than I can possibly describe to you. I've had entire years of "Day 1"s so much so that to claim this is a "new beginning" feels far far more than foolish. I don't feel optimistic at this moment - I don't feel pessimistic either but I've done this enough to know that I'm in no place to blather some platitude like "THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE REST OF MY LIFE!!" just yet. ..But I will say that this time does actually feel different. Not because I'm full of determination and motivation or optimism or any of the other stuff I thought I was before but because I know it's time. I've already had a taste of what my life can look like when it's different than this and I want more of that; If I must be addicted to something I'd rather try health instead of the same boring misery illness and binge cycles...I'm rambling and my sleepiness is making me sound inane. Sorry. ..What I did realize earlier today was how ridiculous I was to earnestly believe that I had "no real consequences" from continuing to binge drink a few times a week. Hating myself and living in a state of perpetual stasis and self-loathing is a pretty real consequence.. ..Okay I'm done being pedantic and trite. For today. .Thank you for giving me this space. I'm genuinely glad to be here which is the first time I've ever said or meant that in any sober recovery space. ..TL;DR: I will not drink with you today.   .

&gt; Hating myself and living in a state of perpetual stasis and self-loathing is a pretty real consequence..Whoop there it is. It seems to me that you've put a lot of thought into this and already done some serious self-examination so that's something to be proud of. Welcome to SD. I will not drink with you tonight.
I will not drink with you today! Thanks for sharing :)
