Enjoying a little more energy today! I'm still struggling with sleeping at night):

Likewise. I'm waking at least twice a night but it feels better than being hungover I find. :) 
My day 10 sleep is getting better. I used to pass out around 9 and wake up between 2-3 and be up most the rest of the night. ..Now I stay up closer to 11 still up at the same time but it's crazy how much more rested I feel. Sleeping 9-5 while drunk and waking up was way worse than 11-5 solid. Sleep is the main health concern from drinking I'm working on
