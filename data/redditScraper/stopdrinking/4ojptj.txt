&gt;I'm not necessarily looking to mimic any of your behaviors..Here's the thing: you probably do want to consider doing what other people did. I was stuck for a long time thinking I was going to figure it out on my own my own special vintage of recovery that no one else had thought of yet. Once I realized that people who had long-term sobriety know what they're doing and I started listening and taking direction things started to improving for me.
I've not relapsed (yet) and not planning on doing so.  However I think u/Nika65 provided a great touchstone earlier at this link [Dont put pressure](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/4oj82y/dont_put_pressure_on_yourself/).  I know that I've been mindful of those very items and made sure I had support.  I also go to meetings regularly...There's a saying "meeting makers make it."..Has worked for me...Just for today I don't drink with you.
I stopped believing the lies I was telling myself...No I will not just have one.    .No it will not be ok.       .No I do not deserve a drink or whatever.     .No not just this once.      ..And I stopped thinking I had all the answers I started really listening at AA meetings instead of listening to compare to find the differences the things I could argue about - I listened to how it was working for the person sharing. ..as the fucking old timers said I took the cotton out of my ears and put it in my mouth. **and i really really hated that they were right**.
I wrote a [long post about my great epiphany and final night of drinking in this great thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3pyxf7/relapse_did_i_ever_stop_drinking_or_do_i_still/) by my pal u/coolcrosby
I think for me it was when I finally stopped trying to prove what I knew to be true. I truly was an alcoholic. I had admitted it I sorta accepted it before but there was always a "but" attached to it. My day one started and there was no more "but" involved. I for some reason was not only ok with my alcoholism but I owned it. That is when the door to recovery opened up for me. I still own it to this day.  
For me I just kept trying to get sober. I fell off a bunch of times and was afraid I'd never stop but gradually I grew tired from and of drinking and eventually I got to the point where it was easier for me to stay sober than it was to keep drinking. I found SD one day after a bad bender when I was looking for local meetings to attend and I thought "I'll try this route for a bit..." I was very skeptical and I lurked a while but I started with about a week worth of dry time and at around 90 days I believe I requested a badge but I just got involved and started reading posts and doing the check-in every day and for some reason SD just made sense to me because it was quite simple. No steps no finding a sponsor etc.; Just don't drink today. That's something my mind could manage and I knew it. After getting six months on my badge I decided to go for a year. Next I thought okay I'll go for two years one day at a time. It's been very gradual and hasn't always been easy but something about SD made it possible for me to stay on the wagon this time. I've never been sober for this long in my life and the longer I didn't drink the more I began to realize that I could in fact maintain sobriety long term. It's been easy at times but not easy enough for me to forget how much effort it took to get to where I am today. Nowadays I don't think I could get another two years if I tried to resume drinking and as a result I'm not in any way interested in trying to test the waters but like I said it was something that happened gradually and I learned to just not drink no matter what. I still get sad mad and lonely but I've slowly learned to cope better and just deal with what happens good or bad without alcohol. I hope this response makes sense thank you for posting I learned from this post and was able to make a sobriety timeline in my head tonight that makes a lot of sense. Thank you! Peace and good vibes to you.
