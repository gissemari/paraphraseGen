So I had about 2/3rds of a tall fruit beer last night with friends over the course of 3 hours. On Friday night I sipped on a dirty martini with my family after a funeral. I did this as a test to see how I would mentally and physically react after 70+ days without a sip. I honestly felt nothing. No buzz no urge to drink more no hangover the next day or regret. My physical symptoms which may or may not be due to alcohol are no better or worse after a single drink 2 days in a row. ..I have no idea what any of this means. I don't consider this a relapse/reset and I'm going to continue my sobriety at least until I figure out the underlying cause of my issues. Until then it feels somewhat good to know that I have control over my actions and having a single drink will not cause me to spiral out of control.
