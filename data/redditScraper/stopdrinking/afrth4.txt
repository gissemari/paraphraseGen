I'm sick my throat feels like shit my body aches and I'm resume classes tomorrow at 8:00 in the morning. I'm just starting this cold so I'm getting the worst of it on the first day of school. But I'm the happiest I've ever been in my life. I've struggled with depression and anxiety all my life but for the most part since I quit drinking I've been perfectly content and happy with my life. Just know that not everybody's story isn't the same but it does get better (if you stay away from the booze)
