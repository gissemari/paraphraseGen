I keep relapsing over and over again. I know struggling is part of this but god dam its so hard. I make it a few weeks or few months and them bam I somehow convince myself I am ok and go back to drinking. Then the same thing happens all over again. ..I don't know where to go I can't seem to find an AA group I click with. Should I talk to the doctor should I look into outpatient rehab? ..I didn't do anything stupid last night but god dam I just can't go on like this any more.

I'm happy to not drink with you today 5 minutes at a time if you like.  Sending you internet hugs &amp; good vibes.  You can do this.
&gt; Should I talk to the doctor should I look into outpatient rehab?..There have certainly been people here who have had success with either one.  What could it hurt to try?  I personally was really afraid to come clean to my doctor but in retrospect I'm not really sure what it was I was worried about.
One thing that I have learnt in AA is that I have learned the most about myself and drinking from the people I liked the least in my AA meetings.  They challenge me to think more and I challenge myself to listen and take something away from when they speak.  It may be someone whom is really preachy about jesus christ is our savior and everything good and bad is because jesus died on the cross for our sins.  I ponder and it makes me think that I don't have to believe in what they do but something they believe in is making them happy and able to tackle this demon.  What can I learn from this ?
Update:..I made an appointment to be seen tomorrow for an assessment at a treatment center.
