Trigger Warning: this post contains information about suicide. Please stop here if you are sensitive to this. ..My anonymous account since there are too many posts on my main. ..A month ago I competed in a bartending competition and lost. I got wasted with my dad and my boyfriend instead. I lost control. I went to my dark depressed part of my brain and I slit my wrists vertically when we got back to the Airbnb. ..My dad and boyfriend saved me. I then tried to beat up my boyfriend and then I tried to hang myself. ..I was completely blacked out and don't remember any of this. ..I have no control over alcohol. Alcohol controls me. I am a month sober today...I'm really sad right now and it's taking me everything not to make myself a Negroni right now. I live with my dad currently. My boyfriend and I are planning to move in together next month. He's sober too. It will be easier. ..I just wanted to reach out to someone. I'm going to make myself some tea. I'm going to indulge and have ice cream. ..I'm strong. I will not drink with you today.

Sending some good thoughts your way.  You can do this  1 second at a time if needed. If I can stay simpler anyone can. That will give you a chance to work on the other issues. ..Day 3525
Theres not much to say. That is pretty intense. I can really on suggest things that have helped me out. The two biggest things would be. Magnesium glycinate at night and selank. Selank big time.
