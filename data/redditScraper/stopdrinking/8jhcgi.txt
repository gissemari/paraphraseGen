Had three dreams last night where I was drinking. When I realized what I was doing it was pretty scary/depressing and I woke up. It's weird. I've tried quitting before and failed and when I drink those times it's enjoyable \(while drinking/drunk... obviously miserable and guilty again once it's over\). But for some reason it's terrifying in dreams. And even when not trying to quit I've had dreams where I felt I was drunk before and also hated that. This is kinda just random rambling but I'm wondering why it's so horrifying in dreams whereas if I choose to relapse in real life it's at least "enjoyable" in the moment. Anyone else thought about this or had similar experience with dreams? Any idea how long the drinking dreams last? Thanks!
