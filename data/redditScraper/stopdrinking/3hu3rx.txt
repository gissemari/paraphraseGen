for the weekend. After being moved eight months. Seeing friends and family. Have to go to return some things and pick stuff up. I'm not exactly capable of drinking in my current situation but there I am... I've been up all night thinking about how this weekend will turn out. I rarely sleep with these thoughts. I sense a relapse. I don't get it. I'm going to try not to but every day I'm flooded with thoughts of bingeing my anxiety away. There I don't know if I'll be able to have the self control I have here. I just know how easily I can fail myself and end up banging my head on the wall. ..I've been in and out of this sub. Relapsing is hell for me yet my sober brain loves to torment me with the thoughts. It'd be best to just avoid the situation. Yet so easy to grab that first drink when I'm out there. This feeling is harsher than it should be. ..Well here's hoping to the best...I have taken small steps in the past forty days. Got a therapist joined a peer support group yet to go to any meetings though.

&gt;Well here's hoping to the best...Dude don't just "hope". That does not work. Hope is a weasel word and I may be wrong but your post reads like a plan to drink this weekend...How about  **" I won't drink this weekend"**? and **"Here is my plan to not drink"** ?..Hoping to get sober never worked for me. I hoped I would get sober for a  long time and it didn't work. After decades of that shit I gave up hope. I embraced **Doing** and gave up "hoping"...Take care of yourself..
My plan not to drink this weekend is as simple as "I am not going to drink TODAY no matter what."  Tomorrow I plan to make the same resolution.  By the way I found that if I really cared about my sobriety it did not break my am or my spirit to go to an AA or other recovery meeting.  In the end it was a lot cheaper than a bar or liquor store.
I may be off the mark but from personal experience I'm wondering if your thoughts might be something along the lines of "the old gang's going to go the bar and if that happens what choice do I have but to have a drink?"..I know that for me I often felt like the one thing I couldn't do was let my sobriety intrude on anyone else.  So if someone was wanting to go to the bar with me: "oh well I can just as easily start my sobriety tomorrow instead".  If you really want to shake this and it sounds like you do you should probably try to have a solid plan that doesn't go to hell if x or y (ie friends want to go to the bar) happens...A lot of folks on here say "sober friends sober situations" etc... Personally I haven't needed to do that where I'm at but I have had to be serious when I say I'm not drinking today.  But the experience has proven to me that no one really cares about my drinking except me.  And bars have plenty of non-alcoholic options and the bill you get at the end of the night is an awesome change of pace!  ..You don't have to let your sobriety be at the whim of circumstance!
