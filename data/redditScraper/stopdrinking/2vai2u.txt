I made it 55 days. Pretty good. I don't know why I relapsed. I didn't have a good reason. I just walked to the liquor store and bought a half pint of whisky. Then went to the bar...alone. Woke up in bed pissed off. Then my alcoholic brain took over and I went and bought a fifth of shitty vodka ("you've already relapsed might as well get fucked up.") ..As far as relapses go... Not the worst one. I didn't do anything stupid. I am not even really hungover. But I am disappointed in myself and that's the worst. I was really proud of my sobriety and people were even giving me praise for it... ..I definitely proved to myself that I am an alcoholic. Lesson learned. Badge reset. Moving forward. ..I will not drink today. .

Good that you're back on track. Let's do it.
&gt;I don't know why I relapsed...No reason to make this complicated: it's because you chose to drink...&gt;I definitely proved to myself that I am an alcoholic...I've rarely seen a case where there is a simple off-on switch to getting sober. There is a commitment to living sober and pursuing that. Instead of focusing on proving whether you are an alcoholic focus on doing the things it takes to live sober. You can do this!...
Good that you learn from your mistakes. You can do it!
Good job on the accountability post. ..I've done the exact same thing as you more times than I care to remember. I'd hit 1 or 2 months and BOOM stumbling drunk around the house going WTF man?!?! What happened? ..Do you have anybody in your life that you can be accountable to? Calling people before I made the trip to the liquor store has saved my ass more than a few times.
Welcome back! I hope we fucked up your drinking! :) Don't drink today.
I'm clearly not endorsing it but there's nothing like that big slip-up about 50-60 days in to really drive away any lingering doubt and solidify your resolve. I did it badge+1day ago so welcome to the club and welcome back.

we all make mistakes. the important part is jumping back on and plugging away. i'll raise a glass of water and toast to not drinking today! 
Thanks for sharing your experience.  You've helped me not drink today.
Reading this scares me a lot.  I am worried this will happen to me.
Hey you admit it.  You relapsed.  Don't let it snowball from there...I did too on Friday.  I personally snowballed all weekend with the mentality - 'hey I did it Friday.  Might as well drink up all the beer in the fridge'...Monday is a start of a new week and a new start towards sobriety.  
&gt; I definitely proved to myself that I am an alcoholic. Lesson learned. ..You already knew that a couple months ago...* Dec 14:  [I am finally coming to terms with the fact that I actually am an alcoholic and that I have zero ability to control myself once I start drinking.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2pbvkw/dear_alcohol/)..* Dec 15:  [I also noticed that my brain is that of an alcoholic.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2peoem/how_today_went/)..So while your positive attitude is commendable I fear that you're bound to repeat this whole ugly ordeal yet again and again and again.  How will you prevent that from happening?
Pick yourself up dust yourself off get back in the saddle and rejoin us on this sometimes rough and rocky path to peace and freedom!
Just like you I relapsed quite a few times at 40-60 days.  It was never worth it and I always felt terrible afterwards especially when I did the whole "you've already relapsed might as well get fucked up." bit...It does get easier. My cravings at 239 days are a small fraction of what they were at 55 days.
