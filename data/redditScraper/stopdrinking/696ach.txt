I feel absolutely helpless depressed and like I don't have any control at all. I feel terrible for anybody in my life. Will this ever get easier? I hate myself and I really don't know what to do.

This rollercoaster of emotions is a hard thing to deal with. Know that you are not alone and that it is possible to turn another page. Pop into a few AA meetings talk with a therapist or simply have a sober meet with some friends. You need to break the perspective thata lcohol is something you need to keep on living. I wont drink with you today!
I also felt helpless against it and now realise that I was in denial. I knew superficially that it was harming me but subconsciously did not believe it was really that bad.
For me relapses were/are part of the journey. Having said that this is the longest stretch of sobriety I've ever had and one of the best tools I have I learned right here on SD - when I think of drinking I simply play the tape forward - it ALWAYS ends ugly. Wishing you peace on your journey. Glad you're here.
