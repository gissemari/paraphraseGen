There is a certain luxury to being able to give something up 100% and I am thankful for it. Something is there to be avoided like a shadow and I can always stay in the sun if I don't want it cast. I don't have to let the vampire in when he knocks. I have a door and a clean house Churchill's sober morning and nothing ugly to show for it. I'm blessed through and through...My breaking off story isn't very dramatic: My fiance went on a diet to lose weight and I gave up the sauce for six months as a show of support. I eventually amended the six months to a longer stretch and a personal challenge. I bought a couple e-cig packs for us at a friends recommendation:  his for weight loss and mine to calm jitters my ever-nervous hands and to give me something to tinker with obsessively at four in the morning. /r/electronic_cigarette is a great subreddit by the way and I highly recommend them for anyone who likes to smoke weird shit and lengthly antiestablishment rants against against the FDA. I have a few art projects in the works and one incredibly misguided attempt to make my own cell phone case which became a Prismacolor whirl of disaster. The only dramatic American Protestant confession anyone is going to get here is that sometimes I posted in SRS drunk but I still do that sober and I really really dig it. And to some of you I am sure I am literally worse than Hitler now but if the only thing this proves is that I'm mean sober too then I guess we can all live with that...So maybe you noticed it further up. Know my fiance the one who's losing the weight? Well he's the one who's struggling much to my surprise. I had fleeting moments where I expected I'd be the one sneaking off on dog walks for my favorite cocktail Bombay Sapphire on the rocks with a side of achar mint chutney and papadums. Instead he's been running off to the gas station for his vices. And first I was like *What the hell man!? The fuckin' shit is this shit?* You just have to give up fatty foods carbs and  sugar and bike more. I have to give up Strongbow... *STRONGBOW!* ONE DOES NOT SIMPLY WALK OUT ON STRONGBOW!!!! He was supposed to be the strong one and it was equal parts confusing and amusing when he bent the rules in a way I really couldn't. Even if he kept on his diet he had off days. How many dry people can set aside one day where they drink literally whatever they want from wherever they want with the blessing of a doctor and society? If it was a sobriety plan it would be the equivalent of a binge drinker who set aside Saturdays to get hosed and pulled O'Douls the rest of the week...100% is a lot easier to pull off than halfway it turns out. I can stay away from booze pretty reliably because it tends to be labeled when it's in products. Watching him put down a can of organic local tomato sauce (because fuck you! tomato sauce has as much sugar as a candy bar now!) and order Thai without the option of white or brown rice is the thing that really kills me. He will for the rest of his life always *have to eat*. I will never at any point have drinking as the same basic need. He will never get 100% and that's why he's worse off then I am...In these past three weeks my rewards have been immediate. My face has gained a certain level of perkiness and youth and my eyes are wider. I have lost about seven pounds in water weight. I sleep better and my digestion has improved. My bank account is absurdly fuller than I would have ever thought possible in such a short time. He didn't see such immediate rewards. He never got the Pink Cloud. His success has been slower and seeing mine probably hasn't helped either. I want his rewards for him but I can't give them to him...I adore him and the love we have together is so important and that's what I can give. When I told him all this his face lit up. He was so appreciative of the understanding. And when I think of it both of us giving up our vices at the same time probably wasn't the greatest plan in the world. We weren't trying to compete as much as we were unsure of how to support one another. We just didn't know which plan would be easier...So I'll stick to mine and I'll set the example and I won't take it for granted that he will always stick to his. We're different people and we're blessed in different ways. 100% of the time.

I have user name envy.
Wow I never thought of it in quite that way. Thanks! It is true that I came to the realization that giving up alcohol 100% was much easier than attempting to moderate myself. Just NOT drinking takes the stress away rather than trying to police and manage an unmanageable addiction. ..I'm so glad you compared this to dieting and food issues though. While I quit alcohol to get my shit together my best friend is struggling with diet and exercise. She is obese and she admits she eats as though it is therapy. I've always felt loving and compassionate toward her she is my nearest and dearest and the one person I would hide a body for. But I admit I don't always understand. A lot of people don't understand. People tend to say well eat less and exercise. It is that simple. Just like it is that simple for an alcoholic. Just don't drink. But while we classify alcoholism in one category we don't look at food addiction in the same way. A lot of people look at it through the lense of lazy and lack of willpower. But while we can back ourselves up by abstaining completely a food addict cannot. They have to interact with food to survive...Thanks for giving me something to think about today and a renewed sense of understanding for my friend. I'm glad your SO has you.
