My brother in law is 10 years older than myself. Two very young kids. He was just hospitalized due to alcoholism. I am also an alcoholic (25 years old). I want to connect with my brother in law let him know that it's okay to struggle. How do I reach out in a way that acknowledges I know what it's like without being condescending?

How would you feel about about inviting him to a meeting?
How about a "Hey so-and-so. I know you've been going through tough times but I want you to know that you aren't alone. I'm trying to figure things out too so we're in this together. By the way here's a Reddit group I use to help me through times of struggle and if you are interested in going to an AA meeting I'll give you more information about mine. P.S. you don't have to talk with me about it if you aren't comfortable but I've found talking with other people who have the same struggles to be extremely helpful."
I would just reach out and say so. I've found the best thing I could do for others is work on myself. My sobriety has inspired people around me to reconsider their relationship with alcohol. The idea of living a sober life is terrifying at first seeing someone else living a sober life and enjoying it is extremely inspiring.
