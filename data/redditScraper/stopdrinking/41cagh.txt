Good Morning/Afternoon!..*Theme:* Sticking with it!..**"The most difficult thing is the decision to act the rest is merely tenacity. The fears are paper tigers. You can do anything you decide to do. You can act to change and control your life; and the procedure the process is its own reward." - [Amelia Earhart](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/a/ameliaearh120929.html?src=t_tenacity)**..*What I get from it:* Someone said to me at the very beginning of my journey that choosing to quit drinking was simple but not easy.  It took me a little while to understand that [but I get it now](http://thesimplehappylife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tenacity.jpg).  I make a simple decision every day to not drink.  Sticking with that decision through the ups and downs of daily life and all the struggles that come with it and then adding in the new challenges that come with suddenly being sober after years of drinking....well that all falls under the "not easy" category for me for sure.  But I stick with it and I remain tenacious because this process is important and amazing.  It's also about time I put some good honest work into bettering myself.  And the end result I get for staying sober is [beyond worth it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp5JCrSXkJY).  ..Have an awesome day all!

Sticking with it is the hardest part of it for me. I know that probably sounds obvious but I didn't expect it to be. ..Sometimes I just think the fact that things have gotten so much better since I stopped drinking means it would be safe for me to start again. WHY BRAIN WHY? ..Thanks for the reminder! 
Continuing to make the choice to be sober is a challenge I've failed before but I am committed to steeling through the difficulties and learning from the process!
Ooooh good one! My take: Just take that first damn step. It took me forever to make that decision to not drink; waiting for the perfect time that of course would never arrive. I know I'm a better person when I don't drink. I know I am not living up to my potential when I do drink. Every day further in this journey and I feel like I am becoming the man I want to be living an authentic life of my choosing.
Reminds me of a quote from a particular book.....&gt; It was at this point Bilbo stopped. Going on from there was the bravest thing he ever did. The tremendous things that happened afterwards were as nothing compared to it. He fought the real battle in the tunnel alone before he ever saw the vast danger that lay in wait.
Great inspiration!  I know for me their is a companion to "just my willpower".....I need support from a higher power manifested through people around me who understand the struggle and want me to be successful.  That for me is the conundrum: when I go it alone through sheer will power I drink; when I surrender I don't drink!
that's a good quote!
Thanks KetoJam!  Loved this!
&gt;the process is its own reward...This is what stands out for me. This is definitely not a race. If there is a finish line it's always 24 hours away. I try to do the little things each day that make the journey/process better. Not drinking today helps me do that. Happy Sunday!
