I just ate a piece of steak that apparently had a jack Daniels glaze on it that I didn't know about. I'm 5 days sober and have zero desires to drink. Am I back to day one? Is this a  relapse ? ..Thanks in advance for your responses and the support I've received.

Nope. Not back at day 1 and not a relapse. 
If it were me no I wouldn't consider it a relapse. It's the intentions or reasons that compel someone to drink that really drive the relapse imo. If it was an accident then you really didn't have any intention to drink.
If you find yourself trying to drink enough of the sauce to get sauced maybe. ;-) Most ethanol is cooked out if used properly anyways keep it up congrats on 5 days!
You're fine. You didn't make a decision to drink. For myself just a hint of a taste of alcohol is enough to let loose massive cravings that I am usually not strong enough to ignore so I avoid alcohol in food. Others aren't bothered by it. Good job on 5 days!
Alcohol is usually cooked out of things so I wouldn't count it. TBH my personal take is the only good use for alcohol is cooking at this point. But yea after it's been cooked in something it wont react with your brain and blood the same way it would if you drank it so your fine :D 
The actual alcohol should be cooked out just leaving the flavor.  So you didn't drink and you're not back to day 1!
Not a relapse friend.  Don't sweat it.
Nah. Nothing at all...Only about 10% of alcohol actually cooks out of food in something like tiramisu but a glaze? On a steak? Onto day 6!
About two weeks in I was having a really tough night. I opened an assorted box of chocolates sure enough the first one I popped in my mouth was filled with champagne. Freaked out at first but eventually forgave myself. Ended up eating the entire box. IWNDWYT
I'd say you are good. Keep on keeping on!
