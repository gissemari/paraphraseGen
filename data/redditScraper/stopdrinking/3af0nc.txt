I have struggled with stopping drinking particularly in the beginning I could barely make a week. Then I could make two weeks. Then a month. But I would chronically relapse and relapse...Since I've made some changes in my thinking it's been easier this time around. I haven't actually been craving and thinking about alcohol that much. Until about two days ago. I don't know if there is something about 90 days or just the stressors of the past few days but I have thought about drinking more than once. More like a lot...I am able to put those thoughts away by basically telling them it is my alcoholic brain trying to kill me. And its working for the most part. I do believe I will hit 90 days. But damn it has it been hard these past few days...My spouse is supportive but he is not an alcoholic and therefore does not understand like you do. So thanks for listening!..

90 was a real tough milestone for me too.  What worked and still works for me was to just keep it simple.  Don't drink today.  Go for a long walk.   
Hang in there Deedee.  Be easy with yourself and realize that you can accept your cravings and not drink.  Anything you need to do otherwise to get over the hump will be a good thing.  Walking singing gym movies etc.
