Hey everyone it's Wednesday that means the week's half over! How's it been going? Share your triumphs struggles or just general chat!..Triumph: Had a good date over the weekend.  We've been talking since and I hope to see her again...Struggle:  Sobriety and dating is *weird*.  I didn't do much "dating" when I was drinking so this is all new to me.  That said it's rather exciting!..General chat: August what the hell gimme back my summer!..Have a great 24 hours folks!
----------immediate responses--------

I should be getting my one day badge today I feel damn good about it too!
Triumph: sticking to budget and cooking all my meals this means I am very grown up...Challenge: wrangling key selection criteria still haven't nailed the concept......General chat: baking a berry sugar wheat dairy free crumble. Think coconut butter (oil) almond flour and nutmeg...August hell yeah end of winter counting down big time.
Hello sobernauts!..Triumph: Family reunion went well.  It was great to see my family.  My parents and siblings are all wonderful people. Also I got back to get letter at work showing I've received a raise.  It's not much in real dollars but it represents how valued I am here and I am thrilled...Struggle: something about being home with family makes me feel like I revert back to an earlier/different identity that I left behind- one I don't like as much. Makes me feel neurotic.  Just in general I feel a lack of control over life right now.  Spouse is crazy stressed from work I am nursing a mild cold and my eating has been all out of whack--so I'm gaining weight...General chat: where I live school starts TOMORROW.  Crazy.

Hey NMBP!  Thanks for posting.  You make Wednesdays more exciting to wake up to!..Awesome news about your date.  That's exciting stuff.  Being married for 16 years I don't even remember what it's like to date anymore.  And I'm glad for that...**Triumph**: More than ever sobriety is just part of my life.  I've noticed that I can be around alcohol now and it bothers me no more than when I'm around people eating chocolate (I'm allergic).  At a party on Friday I even ordered two drinks (with you guessed it Beam) for my wife.  It was instinct to order them as the waiter came up.  And fantastically it was instinct to order myself water.  And besides noticing how natural both actions were I didn't think about it much...I think I've settled into my new weight nicely.  It's now four weeks in a row that I've weighed between 204 and 206.  And I've stopped using MyFitnessPal to track that stuff (it was SO helpful -- thanks AF/OTR but when it feels unnecessary it's tedious).  In fact I feel like I'm struggling to eat enough these days.  I think that's representative of how my habits changed while using the MFP app.  My dinners usually include a huge salad (or two smaller salads) and a meal...My marriage feels on track again.  We're working through our issues but we are both feeling really good about how things are going...**Struggle**: If I had to search myself REALLY hard I guess I'm struggling with my muscles being sore from so much tennis and Krav Maga!..**General Chat**: Hey!  Where I live there's almost one full day of July left.  DON'T TAKE THIS AWAY FROM ME!
Hey!!! ..**Triumph** I'm down 10 pounds. Been working out every day. The dreams about alcohol have stopped and I feel much much healthier in general. I honestly have no plans to start drinking again at any time. I'm finding it remarkably easy to turn down alcohol when it is offered to me. ..**Struggle** I'm still having some trouble occupying myself. My whole world was about alcohol before and now I still feel a bit bored. This week I painted a few pieces of furniture to get a new look. I've also been watching a ton of old movies. I want to go out and date and other social things but I'm afraid of how my social skills will be when I'm sober? Sometimes people get weird when you tell them you don't drink..This weekend I went to the pool with my parents and a few of their friends offered me drinks. I of course responded with my casual "Oh no thank you I'm not drinking today" and every single one of them gave me this kind of condescending "*Why?*" with a snarky look. Uhm idk maybe don't be so judgmental about the fact that other people aren't partaking in something that isn't always a social norm? Ugh I usually just respond with "oh Im just trying to lose a little bit of weight" ..**Casual convo** number one that commercial with the camel saying hump day makes me laugh sooooo hard. ALSO I know we are not drinkers but that show on Comedy Central Drunk History seriously has me in tears every time I watch it. It's such a perfect combination of ridiculous drunk story telling by the narrators and perfect acting/lip syncing by the re-enactors. Last night's episode with Jen Kirkman narrating and Winona Ryder and Michael Cera acting had me laughing so hard I woke up other people in the apt. I would definitely recommend checking out that show 
Triumph: I was asked to lead communion this Sunday. I've been a minister at this church 2 months and feel so incredibly accepted it's amazing. I've never led communion before &amp; I'm honored. I'm also moving home next week &amp; excited to see my friends. They've saved the 10th for me...Struggle: I'm moving 800 miles away next week (back home). My roomate is gone &amp; getting married. The guy I was seeing here completely imploded when we realized I had a week left and I'm sad. ..General Chat: I have no idea life is super full!
Triumph:  People keep telling me how good I look and how badly I need to by new ~~close~~ clothes because I am losing so much weight...Struggle:  Waiting for my blood work I gave on Monday each minute that I don't get it is killing me...General chat:  I got an SSD ~~drive~~ for my laptop as a reward for my not drinking for 12 days.  It is awesome and anyone who does not have one is missing out.
Triumph: Well I quit drinking last Sunday and have been keeping and feeling well/better. I'm better able to do the things I want to do and better able to deal with the stresses involved in having to move house...Struggle: I'm in an apartment that's about 100% too expensive and 50% too empty (ex left me 3 weeks ago) and I haven't found a new place yet but there's movement at least. I'm wondering (not yet worrying) how my first social meetings are going to go and what the online alcohol treatment program people are going to say tomorrow. Also I think I might be spending a bit too much time on this subreddit.....General chat: Heat wave incoming in the Netherlands! Expected temperatures around 35C on Friday. Luckily the tap water here is better than the bottled stuff: it's the same source but cheaper :-) 
Hey guys. How's it hanging? Going strong at day 3 I think my badge is off though. Fine with me though.  So my triumph just got done with my first meeting. Huzzah! It couldn't have gone better. The energy in that room was palpable just love and exceptance the whole way through. I started off very sceptical it was very religious. A lot of prayer one of the topics was finding better ways to pray and a lot of talk of god. However the more I listened the more I realized I could take that and easily put it into terms of meditation and self inflection. I'm not a Christian but I am in no ways an atheist. Once I got passed that road bump about 15 minutes in the things these people had to say really hit home to me. An amazing experience. My downfall last night I picked up a six pack on my way home. I didn't even realize what I was doing until I had walked out of the store with it. It was just total habit. I didn't drink it though. I took it home and gave it to my room mate. It's just scary how easy it is to slip up when you aren't paying attention. I'll get the hang of this though. I'm going to another meeting tomorrow and the day after. Thanks for your time guys. 
Triumph: I was able to register for a critical class yesterday that I need in order to graduate. I was afraid to even try to register for it and have been putting it off all summer. I finally bit the bullet yesterday and was successful AND it's with my favorite professor! I think my luck is finally starting to change...Struggle: My life is still pretty much in general shambles...General Chat: I am SO HAPPY to be sober and so grateful for this community. 
Triumph: One year sober today.  In the beginning I never thought I would get here.  Now I can't imagine living any other way.. .Struggle: Not struggling with anything at the moment.  . .General: Life is good and it continues to get better.  I had no idea I could feel this good while being sober.  .
**Triumph:** Just got back from a 2 week vacation and didn't drink! I haven't been on a sober vacation since I was a kid. I didn't think it was possible for me to relax without alcohol but it wasn't too bad. For a change I came back from vacation feeling rested instead of feeling run-down from drinking too much...**Struggle:** I'm still not entirely sure how I feel about AA. I've been to a bunch of meetings and see the value in them and get something out of it when I go but I just don't think I can see myself working the steps. ..**General Chat:** I can't believe it's August tomorrow where has the summer gone??
