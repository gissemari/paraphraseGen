Our very own /u/offtherocks  created a [wonderful map](http://i.imgur.com/rfthSc3.png) of the Sobernaut Empire. I do not know how accurate the locations are but I do believe with the 24/7 coverage we have on here verifies the veracity of the map. I hope this brings a smile to your face cuz it brought one to mine!  .  .**TL//DR SECTION;;** On a more serious note though: I have noticed a trending higher of badge resets. Relapse is a common story for many of us in recovery **it happens**. The thing I find common about most relapse stories is isolation. I am looking at you **lurker**! So I am going to quote some of our members to show you what works (you don't even have to go to any meeting to read this!):  .  .> If I was told in early sobriety that I could not talk I honestly don't think I would be sober now. I would have used that as an insanely trivial excuse to drink and I would most likely be dead. /u/Thornkale  .  .> You are in the most kick ass amazing social media recovery support group. Please let us know whatever we can do to help. Congratulations on taking the first step! /u/SarahSiddonscooks  .  .> Keep posting on r/stopdrinking--maybe you'll be ready sooner than you think. Oh one other thing--explore the sidebar resources /u/coolcrosby  .  .> I can understand how difficult it must be especially when you're young. There is some sadness about getting sober. It separates real friends from drinking buddies and does mean major changes in lifestyle. That's why a support group is so helpful /u/SOmuch2learn  .  .> Guilt anger and shame can be useful to kick-start someone on the road to recovery but in my experience they are counter productive to keeping and maintaining sobriety. We have all made mistakes. There is an old saying that applies here...."No one goes through the doors of rehab on the wings of victory.".So you f'd up. Great....use it to motivate yourself but then let it go. I have news for you: You aren't as great as you might think you are nor are you as bad as you think you are. You are just simply you. /u/Nika65  .  .> In my experience as a recovering alcoholic with alcoholic family members the most loving thing that I can do is to keep boundaries that I need to stay sober even if it pisses them off. Healthy boundaries are an invitation to improved relationships but others may not recognize that and/or may not accept the invitation. Time will tell. /u/algohn  .  .> I suspect your isolation your sense of aloneness is at least amplifying the darkness of your thoughts..I too can isolate with the best of them. I fight this by being active in AA and have met some other amazing misfits..I kept on drinking until 39 it did not get better you are missing out on very little good and untold bad..A sober existence does not have to be muted. It can be as wheee as you want though there are likely to be fewer police chases. /u/Slipacre  .  .> You won't stop until you want to it requires your sincere desire to change. But I hope that you can take your alcoholism very seriously. Consider what you've done for the last 2 years then imagine being in exactly the same spot doing exactly the same thing 10 years from now. If it sounds depressing it's because it is depressing. If it depresses you please consider quitting very seriously..Whatever you do I wish you the very best of luck. /u/seanomenon  .  .I literally have thousands of these quotes from these awesome people on this sub. Be active in sobriety this means have an active voice! Why did I mention the resets and quote all these people?! Because they continue to post and hundreds more post. **There are 742 comments on 60 posts in the last day... if you speak up someone will hear you and relay their experience** Isolation is the white flag the surrender... **You do not have to do sobriety alone!** This is my shout out to you the lurker the ones who stopped posting the ones who post when they feel good but not bad the ones anywhere along the path. Stay active find your voice write out your thoughts! I love you all.  .  .  .*side note: I did not receive permission from the authors of said quotes but I hope they do not mind*

Great post thanks!
I am in South Korea! Can someone add me on that map! :P Stuck in Seoul for a while.
The Western bit of the USA looks suspiciously sparse. I've noticed posts from the Northwest and California pretty often. ..Is this like a nouveau East Coast/West Coast rivalry that they're not lit up? ..Pretty impressive infographic - great work
Awesome and thoughtful post!
YAY!  \o/
Seattle represent I wasn't hung over on Monday unlike most of my friends and it felt damn good!
Brazil here. Nice map!

I'm in the Philippines and in 6 hours I'll be at triple digit days! 
Love the map even though I'm not on it (unless someone or my ISP mistook the Netherlands for Heligoland oh how the Dutch would love that) great post!
&gt;Relapse is a common story for many of us in ~~recovery~~ active addiction **it happens**...For me the most common element of relapse stories is picking up the first drink. ..Humor =&gt; My favorite lurker sub-reddit: /r/lurkers
