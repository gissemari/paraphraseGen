I am in my twenties and have struggled with substance abuse for years. For awhile it was other drugs. Then whiskey. All. Day. Then a couple bottles of wine at night. So the fact that I have gotten to a place where I am "only" drinking four to six beers a day seemed like a victory for a long time. I am not the heaviest drinker anymore I don't black out but I feel like I still need at least some alcohol every day. But I am finding that I just cannot keep up with it anymore. It is affecting relationships jobs it makes it harder to save money I have no energy. Just thinking about booze takes up so much space in my head. Because I am not chugging whole bottles of liquor everyday though it is often easy to justify not asking for help or describing myself as an alcoholic. It's easy to feel like I am making a big deal out of a small problem. I get embarrassed. But I fantasize about being sober. I have quit a few times in the past but never for more than a couple weeks. I haven't had any alcohol today and am really going to try to make this stick. I know that as I get older it is just going to get harder. I stumbled on this subreddit while googling resources for help quitting and so far just reading through old posts is encouraging. So I look forward to any insight or encouragament any of you have!
