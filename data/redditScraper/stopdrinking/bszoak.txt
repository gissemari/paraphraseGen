Hey everyone I know that [This Naked Mind](https://www.amazon.com/This-Naked-Mind-Discover-Happiness/dp/0525537236/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=the+naked+mind&amp;qid=1558817278&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-2) is one that a lot of people on this sub have already read but I just wanted to get the word out to anyone who hasn't heard.....This Naked Mind is a great read for anyone struggling with addiction. I just finished it last night and I gotta say that it really has changed the way I approach alcohol addiction. And not just over-night. I could sense the change in subconscious attitudes after only a few chapters many days ago. At this point I have literally no desire to drink anymore. ..Before I read it there was always a little voice inside me that told me to drink but I was afraid of the hangovers and detox so I ignored it. But now? That voice says "remember when I used to punish my body with that stuff? Sounds pretty awful right?". It's quite nice to not be fighting myself all the time about something I consciously *want to do*...Thanks so much to the people of this sub for telling me about this book and to those who don't know I really think you should [check it out](https://www.amazon.com/This-Naked-Mind-Discover-Happiness/dp/0525537236/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=the+naked+mind&amp;qid=1558817278&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-2)...IWNDWYT

Excellent read indeed. I keep my copy of TNM on hand for daily reference. It has helped me tremendously on my recovery journey. ..IWNDWYT :-)
I've got it on daily rotation along with "The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober." I'm hesitant to finish either because I feel like I need daily doses. They both make so much logical sense to me and feel like absolute game-changers.
Agreed. Really made a difference for me too.
This book is a Huge turning point in my life. As you've described it changed the feeling of being deprived of ever drinking again to THANK GOD I will not drink that drug
I used it as a coaster for my wine glass for about a year then I downloaded the audio book and listened to it on the way to/from work. Amazing book.
