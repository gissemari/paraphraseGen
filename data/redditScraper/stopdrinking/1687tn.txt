Day 8 of no drinking for me probably my longest stint in 2 years.  Had a fierce battle with the inner alcoholic voice but made it through.  Just focused on not taking the first drink and talked through it with my wife.  Going to bed sober again for a night of good rest ready to face another day tomorrow!

Congratulations! Keep it going even through the hard times. Good on you!
8 days is a big deal.  I'm glad you're able to talk with your wife about it.  I hope you can keep it up.  Good luck with Day 9.

That's awesome it's great to have a significant other for support.
(happy dance gif) that voice man that voice wants you deadibones. Sleep the sleep of sobriety - good dreams 
Good advice to yourself just make it thru one day. If thats hard try just one hour. Easy does it.
Congratulations it is one minute at a time if necessary.  Good to have your wife as a support but suggest you increase your sober circle
Good job.  I'm in the barely-over-a-week club and things do get a little shaky.  It's nice to hear you're reasoning through it and coming out on top...Keep it up sir!
Do you have a sponsor? Kudos to your wife but may help to have someone outside family to work through these tough times with. You struggled but didn't drink; ergo it was a good day.
