You know when life is going good like too good? And you just have this feeling that shit is gonna go wrong? Guys. I've been at my job 3.5 years and I worked really hard to get on another team with less stress. Now my team is being absorbed back into the main group. The first 2ish years in that main group caused me to start drinking more. I don't know what the fuck I'm going to do. My schedule is going to change my stress is going to change my whole gd life is gonna change. I've been laid off fired but nothing gives me stress like this. ..I'm not even a month into sobriety and I really really really don't want to relapse. I'm  seeing a therapist and psychiatrist for alcohol abuse ADHD and depression. Is there anything I can do in terms of FMLA and work restrictions? Should I ask them how they can help?

For me I have to stay in the now and not try to live out the future in my mind...Being present is a challenge at times...All I can do about the future is plan and set goals I have no control over what the rest of the world does...Be good to you today 
I'm sorry you're being put back into a stressful situation that triggers your drinking. FMLA may be a good option. ..I went through a really bad depression (still not in the best place tbh but I'm doing better-ish) last summer; like couldn't get out of bed saw no point in life completely hopeless depression. My psychiatrist filled out my FMLA paperwork to allow me around two months off of work. When I returned to work I was allowed to work half days for the first two weeks and then allowed to call out hassle-free three days a month when my lows hit. There's a 12-week/year allotment of time off  under FMLA so you can either take it as continuous leave or use it when you need to. ..You and your psychiatrist can discuss what would be most beneficial for you. The only thing to note with FMLA is that you don't get paid during that time. For my job I had to exhaust all my PTO before I could use FMLA (ex. I have 20 hours of PTO saved so that's two and a half work days I can take covered under FMLA while getting paid... after that I'm protected under FMLA for any other leave but no money is coming in)...I found FMLA to be invaluable for me when I was in a very dark place. Even though I was broke I was in the fortunate position to have an understanding family to lean on financially and not everyone has that safety net. I had a psychiatrist who really advocated for me and made sure my job was safe while I worked through my shit. Talk to your psych and express to him/her how detrimental this new move is for your sobriety then go over what's doable for you as far as FMLA goes.  ..Best of luck!
