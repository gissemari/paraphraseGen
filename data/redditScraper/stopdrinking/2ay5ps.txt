There was a guy at a meeting I go to who rattles off how many days he's been sober at the beginning of each share - I think he's at 5600-something now. It always slightly pissed me off the first nine months after I quit drinking because I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop for me. What was going to set me off? When was it all going to fall to shit again? How could anyone get to 100 days sober let alone something in the thousands? It was impossible...I've been sober for 1000 days and while that weirds me out when I think about it I get why he said it now: what I do today is the same general approach as on day 1. When I wake up I think through what it will take for me to stay sober today and then do those things to the best of my ability. I don't know that there are any tricks or shortcuts or at least I haven't found any [yet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMRrNY0pxfM). There's no top of the mountain where we can rest and say  phew no more work ; the climb is all there is. That hasn't changed...What *has* changed however is my general quality of life. It's night and day compared to when I was drinking. I've experienced things I wouldn't have dreamt of when I was still drinking. I transitioned to a great new job I moved into my own place went on some awesome adventures and have gotten into the best shape I've ever been in. I don't say this to show off but to convey that in my own anecdotal experience life is a hell of a lot better sober than it could have been on even the best day drinking. Sobriety affords me a huge competitive advantage in life for a small daily sacrifice of pleasure (which really had turned from pleasure to nightmare long ago)...Most of all though it's the people. In meetings here hanging out doing [crazy activities](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BlHY69ZsZ0). You all have gracefully helped me turn my life from a petty narrow small existence into something worth pursuing with passion - thank you. I can't express how crucial connecting with others on the same path has been to my recovery. Everyone has to experience the transformation individually but the advice osmosis from being around others recovering is worth gold. If you're struggling today reaching out to someone else for help is the Very Best Thing you can do. It's the reason why great communities like this exist - drinking life sucks so very bad that when we leave it behind we desperately want to help show the path out...So it turns out getting to the thousands was not impossible after all. It's very doable. If I can do it you can do it. There are good days and there are bad days but if you take them one by one they add up and things can get better - way better. Whatever day you're on do what it takes to stay sober [TODAY](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJrmm5P5WSw).
