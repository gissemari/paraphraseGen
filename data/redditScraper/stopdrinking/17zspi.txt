Hey everyone it's Wednesday that means the week's half over! How's it been going? Share your triumphs struggles or just general chat!..Triumph: Completed my 5th step this week.  Ever since doing it I've felt like a new person.  Getting all the crap out is a good thing!..Struggle: Trying not to act like I did in the past.  Now that I know what I can allow myself to become I need not make sure I do my best not to become it again...Also winter - fuck you...General chat: I may get a new guitar today.  I have trouble justifying it to myself but I have fun doing play so why not?..Have a good 24 hours folks!

In a few hours I am going to see the doctor to get the 'all clear.'  Then the trouble begins.....In November I was hospitalized with anemia and liver issues.  After years of hard drinking and several unsuccessful attempts to stop I figured that it was finally catching up to me.  As it turns out the anemia and liver problems were triggered by a medication that I taking...Today the doctor will tell me that I'm fine.  Then I just have to decide if I am going to look at the last 90 days as a speedbump or an opportunity...**EDIT/UPDATE:  Doc says one more test and return to see her in a week.  So hopefully somewhere between 93 and 100 days I will find my resolution.  Thanks for the input so far.
hey again!..Triumph: my 16 month old had a physical she is in the 95th perecntile for size and is functioning at at two year old level!  I also made an amazing cuban prok sirloin roast on Sunday...Struggle: i'm working on being less judgemental of others now that i'm sober.  It could lead to a drunken ego...Other: The Walking Dead Season Three continues this Sunday on AMC!!!!!!..Have a good one...
Hi!..Triumph: Making a concrete plan for 100 days of sobriety (just can't think farther ahead right now. Haven't done more than 30 days in many years.) Wrote down what I get out of drinking what the negatives of drinking are for me. Starting to think about ways that I can take care of my needs in a genuine way. Got rid of all booze put corkscrews etc. in an inconvenient location. I know what I'm doing today and I have a plan for getting through today...Struggle: Realizing that I need to be honest with my husband &amp; close friends about how much I've been drinking in secret/when I'm alone so they understand that there's an "iceberg" effect going on - they don't see that I have a serious problem because they don't know how bad it has gotten. Continuing to hide my past drinking behaviors from them will make it that much easier for me to relapse into the old habits. Drinking loves secrecy and shame so those behaviors have to go. And in the case of my husband I've been pretty deceptive with him which I need to acknowledge and address. Not totally sure when/how this will happen but I get the sense sooner rather than later...Other: Have made some positive new friendships recently with people who share a common passion - horseback riding. Getting into horses is one of the reasons I have for getting sober - I get such a huge amount of satisfaction from every aspect of it and it's been amazing to wake up &amp; realize that I can actually do what I want with my life.

Thanks for posting these NMBP.  I think they're really helpful...Congrats on Step 5.  It sounds like it was a lot of work and difficult (from your previous post) but was rewarding...---..**Triumph**: I liked my previous SMART meeting but I found one I like more.  I'll continue to go to both as long as the first one (the one I like but not as much) is convenient.  But I'll go out of my way to get to the second one.  In the thing I mention in my *Struggle* I felt really good that I was there for my wife and my dog.  And my wife really appreciated my involvement...Also 80 days is a nice round number.  \o/..**Struggle**: It's been a good week so far.  I haven't had any temptations and have been feeling really good all week.  My dog had surgery on Friday and is recovering.  She was in pain early in her recovery and it was really hard to see (and not be able to do anything).  However I didn't even consider picking up.  My old instinct just wasn't there and it felt good...**General chat**: My wife and I decided to buy me a new bike for my birthday.  I can't wait for weather to clear up so I can ride it.  So I guess fuck you winter!
Triumph: I was able to get out of bed today. Morning sickness is a lie it's all-day sickness...Struggle: Pregnancy is fucking hard. I am leaning a lot on my friends coworkers and boyfriend. It's strange not to be doing it myself. I'm not the lone warrior I used to be...General chat: Ginger ale is the fucking best ain't it?
Triumph:  Celebrating five years at the same workplace still doing well but sobriety is giving me the motivation to start actively network and look for a new job...Struggle:  Trying to be a 'good person'?  Not sure exactly what that means but not defining myself by my drinking/defining my self by my sobriety is a huge new perspective for me...General Chat: Going to my first womens' only AA meeting at lunch today!
Triumph: moderation is still working; 21 days sober out of 28. ..Struggle: hit a bump when I came down with a fever this weekend and found myself wanting a "medicinal" drink on Sunday. But the craving passed -- as did the fever...General chat: I got nothing.
