Struggling with depression and fear.  Just trying my best to stay positive and make it through the day.  Wish everyone positive feelings and I will not be drinking with you today.

Hey there I remember the fear from day 4. I'm sure a lot of folks do. Keep breathing. It sounds clich  but that fear and hurt won't last forever. You have really good days coming to you and the fear will diminish bit by bit. In my experience the good days come more and more frequently the longer I stay sober...Be extra gentle with yourself. Wrap up in blankets watch a movie don't worry about being productive. You're already doing the most incredible thing. Drink a fuck ton of seltzer or soda or whatever it is you prefer (that's not alcohol). I won't drink with you today or if you need to take it in smaller chunks I won't drink with you this hour...
I am on Day 2 and feeling the same way.  I have to get through the dentist work and kid activities today.  I just feel anxious and stressed to the max.
