Triumph - I have officially entered the double digit in days that I have gone without alcohol!  Welcome Day 10!  I feel great.  I was very productive this morning and it reinforced the benefit of being sober.  ..Struggle - I CANNOT STOP EATING!!!!!  I had trouble eating before as I do have digestion issues and I think my body was getting so full from all the empty calories in alcohol that I just couldn't really stomach food.  Now I just can't stop.  I am not concerned about any weight change at this point as it is probably evening out as I am no longer consuming high calorie sugary drinks however its just so strange...Has anyone else experienced this when they quit?  If yes how long did it last?..General - I am struggling to find a job I think partially due to my recent record with a DWI.  That happened in May.  I hope I can find one soon..Also me and my SO are moving to a cool loft downtown in our city next week!  Stressful but I still choose to not turn to alcohol for comfort but rather the support of the people here!

Can confirm that I ate everything I saw until about day 13 then my appetite tapered off by itself really quickly to what I suppose is fairly normal. I'm not totally sure what normal is after years of empty calories but I no longer feel like I'm trying to fill a bottomless hole :) 
I'm finishing up day 8 and I agree I feel like a freak because of my appetite!! I think it bothers me the most being around another people and constantly eating. I'm a young woman relatively slim and I don't get any sort of break at work. I'm the weirdo constantly shoving in snacks and coffee but hey I'm sober!!!!
