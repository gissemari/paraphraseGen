It sounds like you're going through a lot of positive life changes: Reentering school stopping smoking stopping pot smoking stopping drinking. Way to go!..You asked for advice: my advice is to be good to yourself you've got a lot going on. Get enough sleep eat well spend some time with friends and make sure to have someone or somewhere to talk about what's going on with you...And sure there have been some famously alcoholic writers but there have been many many more who weren't. The only common thread amongst famous writers is that they did the work of writing. So if you want to be a writer get writing..
You're trying to do something new with your life. Why don't you delve more into that?...
I try to be grateful for the things that I have in my life today. I have shelter I have food I have a chance to improve on my faults and I have family and friends that still care. I have made a decision not to throw that away today by not sitting on the pity pot and feeling sorry for myself and trying to decide if a drink will make it better. That first drink will make me lose everything made not today but eventually. For me not taking that first drink is the easier softer way.
