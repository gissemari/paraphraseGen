Yesterday I told a friend I'd stopped drinking for good. ..I don't think me making this decision came as a massive shock to her I've known her 11 years and she's been witness to my drunken destructive behaviour many times. I'm surprised looking back that she still chooses to stay my friend. But she does and I treasure that. ..She was there when I upset a friend  at a Halloween party I was so drunk and vile bringing up old shit that should have been buried. I decided it was a great idea to hide myself away in the shed at the bottom of the garden refusing to come out one by one close friends came to try and reason with me I ignored them all...I woke up the following day after being persuaded a bed was a better alternative full of regret and remorse. I hated the way that booze turned me into this horrible person. But I didn't stop. This is just one of many examples where one drink spiralled into carnage each time I'd wake up with the same feeling. The anxiety of what I did and said the night before swirling around my brain...I know I can't change the past. What's done is done. I just need to understand that was me then struggling with an addictive poison. I don't want to erase those memories they're becoming less painful with time but I need them to remember what life was like. I know that the romance of just having that one glass of red will start creeping in as I start to become complacent. I can't just have one. I turn into a monster. ..I'm lucky so many people have stuck around. But I wonder how close to the edge I came before their patience ran out...

Thanks for this. Definitely some relationship wreckage in my past that I can lay directly at alcohol's door. Some I may be able to repair; some I can't. Today I won't drink with you.
