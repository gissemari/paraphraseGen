It was Leap Day and there was a lot of talk about doing something crazy seeing that it was an "extra" day.  I decided to make a choice to better my life...crazy right?..I relapsed in late June after doing great for months and got back on track August 3.  I haven't looked back.  It's amazing how different my life is.  ..Truly the best decision I've ever made.

Great job!!!
It would have been interesting to celebrate your sober anniversary once every 4 years. ..After stopping for almost 3 months last year my relapse has been checkered with only a few sober days or weeks. Best decision I ever made but I still have some work to do. Good job keeping up
If you were doing "great" you wouldn't have picked up again...So what's different this time?..Or are you "doing great for months" again?
That's awesome!
Fair play to you.  I had to have test the waters a few times myself.  Today I'm ok Tomorrow who knows. 
Hell yeah that's the ticket. 
I too started stopping this time of the year.  My sober date is Sept 1..I do not recommend such a long slide home but it what I dad to do...Keep at it and the days will keep coming
