My mother is apparently quite upset with me because when I went out today I didn't offer to pick up alcohol for her. She knows I am trying to get sober and I have made it clear I do not want to even set foot inside a liquor store because it might be too much of a temptation...My father told me about how my mother was complaining to him about this. I confronted her and explained again that I didn't trust myself to be around alcohol and it could ruin the progress I have made. Her response? "**Bullshit!**" She literally looked me in the eye after I told her about how vulnerable I feel and callously dismissed it. Apparently to her the inconvenience of buying her own alcohol is greater than the risk of her own son relapsing...I am not upset angry or even hurt. And I am certainly not looking for anyone to tell me how awful my mother is being. I just think this could be useful for someone else who finds a person in their life that isn't as supportive as they might have assumed they'd be...Enjoy your sober day :)

Wow - your mom really has a problem (and it's not you!!!)..Glad you can see through it and know enough to do what it takes to keep your balance.
