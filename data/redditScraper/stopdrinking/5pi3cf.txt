Struggling right now.. I'm in the middle of a very long trip that sucks balls and that I used to get through by drinking a lot... this is a trip I have to go through every week. I drop my kid off at my ex and then have a very long trip back home. This is the weakest and most dangerous moment for me and I'm trying really hard not to cave right now. Don't know where else to turn but here. I just got my three weeks badge today and I'm not ready to give up yet!

I'm sorry you are struggling and glad you are here. ..I wish I had something better than platitudes like "this will pass". I can however offer support and solidarity. I will not drink with you today. 
Hi apeman happy three weeks to us! Sorry you're having such a crap time right now. I got trapped on a train when I took the wrong one by accident a week or so ago and it was the most tempted I'd been. I read SD listened to some soothing meditation music on my headphone. and played solitaire on my phone. Not exciting but it got me thru. Good luck I won't be drinking with you tonight. 
It sounds like you are doing it and getting through without drinking so far so that's a win.  Think of it like working out and adding heavier weights it's tough at first but each time you get stronger and it's easier.  Since this is weekly you are building strength where eventually it will get easier..Hang in there!
