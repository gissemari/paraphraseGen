Hey everyone! I'm just checking in to say I've made it this far. This is my third attempt at quitting. I've found it so much easier this time with reading This Naked Mind. I'm no longer feeling like I am missing out. I now see it like all the drinkers are missing out on feeling this great everyday. I started yoga too and go to various classes a few times a week which has been great. I've lost weight. I also had a wedding which was easy. I found other drinkers at our table felt more uncomfortable with me not drinking but after a while nobody cared or noticed. My mind feels a lot stronger this time and I'm having no cravings. I definitely recommend This Naked Mind to anyone who is struggling. Keep up the great work everyone I won't drink with you all today.

Congratulations on 100 days that's amazing. You should be proud of you. Today I Will not drink with you 
Congrats on 100!..I feel similarly regarding not missing out on drinking rather I feel as though I was missing out all the time I was drinking...I am noticing all those little moments spent with people that I love that would have just blown right past me while I was drinking...Glad to be awake finally :)
Woooot!!! Congrats!
Congratulations. I know it's a real achievement! I can't wait for the triple digits 
In my humble opinion - I think to read "This Naked Mind" is a must.  I was totally blown away by this book!  Please read - it will answer that question "How can I think of never having alcohol again?"
