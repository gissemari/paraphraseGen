The drunk mind teaches you a great deal. It gave me a degree in demagogy an award-winning lying skill and an "I am the victim here!" diploma...This time around I'd decided I will not tell anyone at least intentionally and specifically about my struggle and the days I get to add to my clean greatness and great cleanness. Accordingly and more importantly I'd decided not to share my emotions in times of cravings. Because almost every time that I did this during my previous attempts it's like I threw in a discussion - "Look at this! This is what's happening in my head right now. Whatcha gotta say about this?". It could be a friend with similar experience it could be my wife doesn't really matter no one is peer to my unsurpassed power of persuasion..And surely I immediately pushed the responsibility of convincing me not to do it off of myself and upon them and instead happily accepted the role of the 'other side' in what is now an argument. And of course almost every time I 'won' the 'argument'. I managed to convince them that I need that drink that I 'deserved' it and it won't do any serious harm and why all the struggle when I've got the solution to all hardship right at hand. ..It's been a rough couple of days. The evil inside tries to push me towards this sick way 'out' lately. It's a habit of instant gratification when the broken part of my mind moans 'this is to haaaaard'. When I did nothing all day to earn any gratification but I still want it and I wand it now. And this will not go away easily it's been 20 years it's not like it'll just disappear in 25 days. ..I've gone through meeting years long drinking buddies and a visit to my historically drunk older folks during these 25 days. And it's not really that hard as long as I don't indulge in those fake arguments. And it's not really the people or places that are the trouble it's how I react to them being next to me what I've come used to when I meet them and spend time together. ..It's that internal demagogue craving for the toxic stuff that created it. Kick the motherfucker in the guts every chance you get. And then thank this new and slightly awkward but definitely worthwhile other person for being here. You haven't really talked in a while or spent a lot of time together in years but that other person is really awesome and you've got a lot of catching up to do. And oh by the way that other person is the real you!..I've been on the verge of texting my wife about how I want a drink several times today. But every time I stopped myself because I know that it's just the ON switch of the fine-tuned mechanism that will lead me to wake up shitfaced tomorrow morning...I'm having a few days off starting Friday so I decided to pause this train of thought until tomorrow night if I still want it at least work won't suffer and I'm gonna have one more day under the belt. ..But today? Naah I will not.

For sure -- I find it easier to discuss it her than with peeps in the real world. 
Arm yourself to the teeth and guard that awkward awesome person! .In my case my toxic mind got even more vicious when it realised it was not getting it's fix anymore. That asshole is willing to go below the belt. I had to fight him off all day today. But simultaniously a lot of room for other things is growing. It takes time but we will be alright.
