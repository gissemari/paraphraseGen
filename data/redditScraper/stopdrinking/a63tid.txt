Hi Folks! I've seen a lot of posts about struggling with sleep so I thought I'd share...For those who haven't heard of it ASMR stands for autonomous sensory meridian response. Have you ever been listening to someone voice and something about the tone made you relaxed or even sleepy? Have you ever gotten a tingly sensation on your head and neck if someone brushed your hair? As a kid (mostly girls) did you ever run your nails across a friends arm or back at a sleepover to fall asleep? This is an ASMR response. ..There are a TON of videos on YouTube created to help people relax and fall asleep. Even though the most popular ones are created by beautiful women they're not overtly sexual more nurturing. ..Here's some Wikipedia  info on it: .https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_sensory_meridian_response..Next time you're struggling with sleep check it out (use headphones- it's made to be experienced this way). My favorites are Gentle Whispers and Whispers Red...Happy Sleeping!

Thanks! This is interesting and I will definitely try it. I always found it interesting that I could fall asleep so easily watching reruns of Family Guy or Bob's Burgers. It became like a process for me ...now there's an explanation interesting.
I tried asmr once and it just gave me the creeps.  
Yeah. Cool stuff. Psychetruth.
