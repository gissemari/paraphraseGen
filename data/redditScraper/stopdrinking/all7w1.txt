I don't know if any of my friends here have watched the show Mom. If not I highly recommend it. I've resonated with a few of the things through out the series both sober and drunk (there's an irony in watching a show about sobriety while intoxicatedbut that's for another post). Anyway my attention span has been all over the place since my drinking got out of hand. Tonight was the first time with some sobriety under my belt that I really dove into the episode and boy am I glad that it happened to be this episode. ..Without giving too much away one of the women in the group relapses and ends up in the vicious cycle of 'another day one'. The show did an amazing job of showing the raw emotion the self loathing the heartbreak and the devastation that that cycle brings with it. But you know what else it showed? That it's okay if we don't get it right the first time. And it's okay if we feel those things. But support is essential to get back on the right track. And this community is the best support. ..After the episode I cried. I cried so hard I thought I would pass out. It clicked. That's been me many times. And I have the power to not have to go back there. We all do. Yeah I know it's fictional TV show but it opened my eyes. That said another night and IWNDWYT.
