The struggle is real. It is 6:30pm and my goal is just to get to 9pm so I can't buy alcohol. (No sales after 9!)..This is the furthest I've ever gotten in my sobriety. Usually I'd be plenty in by now and failing yet again!..Meanwhile... I have the most important person in my life trying to convince me to "taper" it off.  Not very enjoyable to have someone convince me it is okay to use this method when I know I can't stop at a few. Ugh! ..The good thing is... I'm finally starting to realize my habits aren't normal. So much denial for so long. I cant believe I used to not even be bothered by drinking around 40 beers in two days. Finally some mental clarity.. that is fucked! That is my typical weekend! During the week.. it is around 8 per night.  Literally.. 70+ beers a week. I'm disgusted...I just had to put my thoughts down to keep myself committed! I'm confident I'll get thru tonight sober... tomorrow is another battle. Weather is supposed to be bad so I'll be stuck inside all day. Was hoping it would be nice so I could keep myself busy outside somehow...Going to try my best!

Hang in there!  All the best.  
I can't for the life of me understand how people can taper! Can you pop a movie on and eat a bunch of carbs? I'm going through a true crime phase and it seems to be quite distracting!
It's crazy right? Just how quickly that becomes normal. It'll take some time for not drinking to become the new normal.
