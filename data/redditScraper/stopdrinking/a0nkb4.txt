I'm back to experiencing relapse nightmares every evening. The last time I put some time together I had a relapse nightmares for 6 months straight. Brutal! Certainly beats the alternative though. Amazing what happens when your brain wakes up. IWNDWYT!

Same here! Still need a couple of minutes when I wake up to realise it was only a nightmare and I didn't drink  
Just had one. Was so terrifying and motivating.
