It was a story of family...We made it into the best of stories. Big Christmases. Birthday parties. Eating meals together watching movies...Camaraderie. ..And then suddenly that fell away. Changed overnight. And got worse...So much gone. I wish *this* was one day at a time ... and it gets better. But it's one day at a time of a life sentence. Plowing through struggling through making the best out of it. And often enough it is. Until it hits you again...This is what made me want to hide. This is what makes me want to hide. This is what made going down the drain tempting...Nothing to say. It's the usual. We'll make a nice evening with food and snacks TV -- hoping to avoid the scenes that hit too close to home...Nothing a night of good sleep won't make better..

Deep. I like it. Just pushing thru. Day by day. Looking forward to a nice nites sleep to forget about it all. 
How are you feeling this morning?  Feeling the feels is really hard some days (some hours...some minutes) certainly more than others...Sharing your sentiments and loving your post xo
Hope you had a good night's sleep and things are going okay for you today...I had some ups and downs yesterday -- things can be going along smoothly and then zing -- hurt feelings.  Holidays over-magnify that stuff and family members are the experts at pushing our buttons.  But -- I did not drink!  Focusing on the good stuff of yesterday instead and looking forward to sober time with friends this weekend...
