4 days sober today and woke up after being up all night (3 hours) and the frustration and guilt of relapse was so real. I was doing so well too. Mad at myself for not being as active in the recovery as active as my alcoholism is...That's on me. I take responsibility for that lesson. Right now my entire body face eyes skin is showing the effects.  My attitude is meh I'm frustrated yet super microscopically optimistic at this point. I've got to start over...I want to beat myself over it because I was coming on this sub and was convinced I didn't want to drink anymore....I wonder what superman thought or felt like when he found krytponite? ..I'm going to change my approach in a couple different ways this time around. Thanks for saving me a seat.

A start is still a start! 
Every relapse/slip is nothing more than a lesson learned.  Pick it up and add it to the stack... remember it and move on mate.  Tomorrow's another day to do better.  You've got this!
