I made it to 2 months and was feeling pretty good. Confident in my sobriety and had no cravings. Then we had a big name concert to go to. I wasn't sure if I was going to drink or not then my Dad said oh you should try one normal beer then one low alcohol. I couldn't find any low alcohol beer and everything went downhill. ..It's so stupid because I was the one buying the beer - I don't even know why! And this artist is sober. ..I still haven't looked at my bank account. I am dreading the damage. I pushed (not even consciously) the fuck it button and although I tried to buy low alc beer there was none and my dumb brain just went fuck it. ..I slept all day Sunday even through my toddler running around (i crashed on the couch had my Dad watch the little fella). I woke up eventually and felt the WORST hangover of my life. I cant stand being hungover and this is why I quit. Its now Tuesday and I'm still not 100%. I made it through Monday feeling like hell - forced myself to go to work even though I just wanted to hide. I had to take a fair bit of pain relief to push through and I gad eaves of nausea. My nerves were shot and my panic attacks came back. ..I hate that I tested my sobriety and that my will gave out so easily. I can't moderate never have. I have 0% respect for myself. My skin is shit again and I have the greasies and sugar cravings. ..This hangover is it. I am done. Fuck you alcohol. ..IWNDWYT

Oh what a nice little reminder.  Low alcohol beer just meant it would be a nice chaser for whiskey for me.  .I am sorry your parental unit was not more supportive.  A lot of times our parents don't want us to have a problem even though we do.  I went through a similar thing with my mother.  This last time around she is waaayyyy more supportive after I shared with her my hangover story...Forcing myself to check my bank account after a weekend of debauchery was the worst...2 or 3 nights of stupidity would leave me barely enough to pay bills and/or feed myself...Welcome back!  May this slip serve as your last reminder...  .
I am so sorry! Welcome back...I hope it doesn't offend you that I laughed about the "I couldn't find any low-alcohol beer and..." -- that is just so me when I'm drinking. It's like "OK I'll have one vodka soda and one water" and then the bartender tries to charge me for water or puts a lemon slice I didn't want in the water and I'm like "OK the only option here is to have another vodka soda". I can't trust my own thinking when it comes to alcohol!
