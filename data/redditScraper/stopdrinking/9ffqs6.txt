Just want to thank all of you out there. Those who have years of sobriety with surplus energy and those who are in their sobriety infancy who struggle. If not for this community alone the possibility of posting dark thoughts I would not have made it yesterday. And then I would not have woken up at 4.48 am running 13km including a gym session as I would be lying somewhere deeply in shame and severely hungover. So thank you. Thank you for helping feel less alone and less like a terrible human being.

Yay! I had a conversation with this demon earlier. Ultimately I realized he was saying :  You don't want to be present. You want escape and chemicals are an excuse for that.  Don't know about anyone else but part of this journey for me is finding how to have that mental escape without drugs. I used to be a big daydreamer as a kid and now I'm allowing myself that again. It's super against the grain of adult life but it helps me not fall into anxiety and mental overload.
