I'm holding out well I pushed my attention into this poem I thought I would share it. ..--------- ..It surrounds me it taunts me I feel besieged.That thorn in my side when I struggle to be clean. .TV and radio the internet and chat.It's all intoxication when I don't need that. ..These doldrums will pass the anguish won't last. .So why can't my mind just settle for that?.It twists and it clouds my rational thought.It makes up excuses it makes me distraught. ..The people the places the living the dead.Are all ghostly voices in my aching old head. .I long for the calm the taste and effect .But I'm not going back or there'll be nothing left.
