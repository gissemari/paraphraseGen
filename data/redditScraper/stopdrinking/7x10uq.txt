Approximately 303 alcoholic drinks not imbibed. ..Little things are still a struggle. Cleaning my house is a big trigger for me. I always "treated" myself to (too) many drinks when cleaning. Still trying to find something less harmful than smoking a cigarette as my "reward" for doing what a regular adult should just do without any "attagirls" but I have to say even my smoking has decreased SIGNIFICANTLY while sober. I don't want to push it and try to quit that (less destructive) vice at the same time. I'm not saying smoking isn't bad. It's just that I would rather smoke a few cigarettes in a day if that is what is currently keeping me from my tipping point...Hope everyone is having a wonderful day...-K

I know I am!  Happy one month sober anniversary!     
Congratulations that's awesome! Don't beat yourself up over the cigs my first few months I let myself have all the sugar soda and cigs I wanted. I did find stopping smoking to be easier than stopping drinking. There's plenty of resources when you're ready the Alan Carr book worked for me. 
Me too! Clean house always meant a reward of wine. Now I buy fresh cut flowers and have a cozy fire. Cost is about the same and the next day the flowers are still there!
