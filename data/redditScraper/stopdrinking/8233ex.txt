I'm back on the sober train ( after a brief relapse) I'm a college student so it was really difficult to label myself as an alcoholic because literally everyone around me gets blacked out. I know I am  an alcoholic because I can't stop after one drink. I also had many blackouts and too many alcohol poisoning's. I really want to stop drinking but it's hard doing this alone. I don't want this problem to follow me after I graduate so it's best to stop now (again). I went to a support group last semester which helped me greatly unfortunately I cannot attend any group meetings this semester. Is it possible to be sober with out any group help? Every time I want to stay sober I end up drinking again any advice would be appreciated!

I would say you've come to the right place and to throw it out there and admit what you have is AWESOME because it is the hardest thing to do. Without inundating you with stuff I would say some good areas to check out are SMART or AA online meetings posting in this sub and checking out the IRC channel in the sidebar for some help/chit chat. Glad you're here!

Good on you for realizing it so early. I thought I might be an alcoholic when I was 22 and went to an AA meeting and convinced myself afterwards I didn't have a problem. 5 years later I'm finally back in the program and it's the best thing that's ever happened to me. ..I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you realize you have a problem and don't want to waste more of your life than you already have I would suggest finding a meeting (whether AA or otherwise) that you can attend and make getting sober a priority in your life. Why is it that you can't fit the meeting you previously attended in your schedule (if you don't mind me asking?)
