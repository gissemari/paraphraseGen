I made it 12 days and relapsed. I couldn't take it anymore my daily life had become so accustomed to coming home and having a drink (or 5) that I just couldn't help myself on day 13. Granted there were some other factors that didn't help...However I find myself sitting at home after work (my girlfriend works insane house I rarely see her... she is the only reason I am trying to do this) and I just don't know what to do with myself. I do play video games but even with that distracting my mind I continually find my right hand reaching out for that drink that isn't there. I even went out and bought a PS3 (I know stupid) so I could play The Last of Us and some other PS3 exclusives... but it still bothers me every day...Any suggestions? I just really need to get my life back under MY control.... thanks everyone.

I didn't drink even though I wanted to.  
If your girlfriend is the only reason you're doing this then it's no wonder you're struggling. It seems like the people who stick with sobriety are the ones doing it for themselves not for other people. I would internalize the reasons you want to quit drinking then just try to occupy your time however you can until you get past the early hump. The cravings will dissipate and sobriety will become the new normal but it takes time.
I'm still working on it but for me it was all about timing. ..I'm a weekend warrior and drink Fridays and Saturdays only. On Fridays after work I'd get the itch by about 6PM-7PM. On Saturdays usually around 3PM-5PM. What I didn't expect -- and was surprised to find out -- that once my "window" of that day closed I was no longer interested in drinking for that day. ..I don't drink to feel buzzed I drink to get drunk. If I start too late I'll probably fall asleep before I get drunk so what's the point? That's just a waste of beer. The first couple of weekends were tricky and I found other things to do during those times that kept me tied up and busy. ..I don't know if that'll work for you but for me understanding that I have moments where I am more vulnerable than others really helped me to prevent what I didn't want happening. 
I found that accepting that alcohol was just as bad for me as chocolate (something I'm allergic to) helped me let go of that yearning.  Additionally I read the Kindle edition of the Allen Carr book mentioned in the sidebar.  It also helped me see alcohol as a poison (or at least something I don't want in my body)...The important thing from my point of view is not "trying not to drink".  It's "becoming someone that doesn't drink".  There's a huge difference there.  One is difficult and a constant struggle.  The other is part of one's nature and is not.  But getting there takes some work...I think you have to want sobriety.  And to get to that point for me I had to see being sober as being better than drinking.  And I do...When I was drinking:..* I was a jerk to my wife (and others).* I was always tired.* I did *nothing*.  I sat on my ass pretending to watch TV and do productive things on my computer.  But really once I was 1/2 way into my first drink of the night I did **nothing**..* I had small bouts of happiness lightly sprinkled into a very depressing life.  Even though I was/am successful in my job and had a "happy" marriage...Now sober:..* I am extremely active.  Just this week: **Sun**: 48.5 mile bike ride **Mon**: 1 hour tennis 1 hour Krav Maga class **Tue**: 1 hour Krav Maga class 2.5 hours tennis **Wed**: 1 hour Krav Maga class 2.5 hours tennis **Thu**: 1 hour Krav Maga class evening off.* I've lost 85 pounds since last July..* I eat much better.* I'm in better shape than I've ever been.* A coworker who is a friend told me that he can tell I'm just an all-around better person.* My wife and I aren't constantly bickering about the fact that I'm always drunk or drinking..* My wife and I are now able to work on real issues in our relationship..* I have small bouts of frustration or sadness in an otherwise extremely happy life...The last point in each list should really catch your attention.  They're huge.  They're hard to explain.  But they're the most significant things in my life due to sobriety.
&gt; she is the only reason I am trying to do this...That's probably not going to work out so well I'm sorry to say....In my experience it took a good 30-40 days to shake the feelings you're having right now.  
I got through the first couple of weeks by going to as many AA meetings as I could. ..You will get control of your life if you don't take the first drink. Then you can start learning how to live sober. AA taught me how to do it. 
I was in rehab.  That helped a lot.  Have you thought about exercise?  That will definitely ease some of that discomfort.  By beginning an excercise regime you will probably help yourself twofold.  Try to get back on the wagon.  It's more fun here (in my humble opinion).
Find someone you can call whenever you're craving alcohol. You might think that's all the time but right before you go to the packy give that person a call. Before going to the liquor cabinet or opening the fridge to grab a cold one call them. It might be a subconscious act but try to be mindful of it. Don't beat yourself up *too* much if you slip it's not unheard of!
Stopping drinking is only the beginning. The goal isn't so much to stop drinking but to start living a life you want to live. In other words if you take drinking out of your life what will you add in? The answer should be things that are important (I.e. your values). ..I had urges the first few weeks I stopped but since I am more focused on acting in ways that are consistent with my values it doesn't feel like a struggle anymore.

It's really hard to get through the first month.  Keep trying.  If you can break the physical dependency then you can work on the other issues.  Make quitting your focus for a month or so.  Don't pile any other shit on yourself.  Let her know that you're quitting and that it's really tough and that you need her support.  Drink lots of water sleep when you can take a multivitamin eat whatever you want for the month.  Go easy on yourself.  Just stay away from the liquor store dump whatever is in the house down the sink.  Hunker down avoid drinking buddies don't go out. Just get through this month and things will be physically easier. Then you can work on your other shit.
