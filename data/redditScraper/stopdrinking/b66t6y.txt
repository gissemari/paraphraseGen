  Mind fogginess is going away.  Body puffiness is slowly reducing.  Going to washroom is not painful and feels (and looks) normal.   Face skin and colour is getting better.  Feel a bit more of energy.  Every day for 4 days now going to gym to do at least 30-40 min. of cardio (feel so much better of drinking water after).  Still have urges but they are mostly under control.  Started to have some meaningful dreams.  Wake up refreshed with some energy.  Starting to track my calories in/out .  This subreddit helps so much!..I know it is only the beginning of the path and I predict it may get rougher as life is a rollercoaster but I wanted to say thank you for sharing your stories and struggles! Please don't give up in the moment of urge come to subreddit read/reply/help each other! I will not drink with you today!.
