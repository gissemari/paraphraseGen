Hey all! ..Nine months sober today!..I wanted to take a second to thank you all for helping me get here. The good the bad and the ugly all your posts have helped me achieve something I was never sure I'd ever have again: I'm my own man again...I'm free to make decisions that *I* want to make not the few the bottle allowed me to make. Consequently I've lost 35lbs I'm back in school with a 4.0 and for the first time in longer than I can remember the future looks bright and the present is worth living. ..This sub doesn't care if I'm pro-AA or anti-AA religious or atheist new to sobriety or relapsed for the thousandth time. You're all there for me every minute of the day with a kind ear and words of wisdom and I cannot thank you enough. ..I hope this sub is here for you the way it has been for me. .."What do we say to the God of Death?".."Not today."
