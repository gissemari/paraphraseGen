So I drank last night.. I have to admit that I did have fun. My problem was always the day after. I always get into these slumps and moods after I drink where I feel lazy unmotivated and really shitty. The difference now is that my consciousness is still there and I know that I can't let myself fall into a slump again....I don't know if I'm saying thank you for being there for me u/stopdrinking or if this is a confession.. but thank you for being here with me. It is a struggle and I'm still trying to figure out what u want.
