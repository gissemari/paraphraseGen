Hey all so going good sobriety wise been struggling with triedness for the last week or so. First two weeks I was full of energy now I seem to be more tired and not able to get enough sleep. I've started talking some B-vitamin supplement. Does anyone have experience with this? Any advice?

I definitely didn't feel like a full "reset" of the body had happened for about a month.  Everyone is different.  ..Be patient with your body and brain.  You put it through hell it's fair to give it a bit of time to put everything back together the way it should be.
That is true I'm trying to figure out if it is something I need to fix or just my body trying to get right.
Yep same here! I will say that I exercised yesterday for the first time in a few weeks and I got an energy boost from that. So I'm going to try and make exercise a more regular thing now. I'm also going to try B12 good call on that!
Yes I just got a full 8 hours two nights ago. I kept going to bed at 10pm and waking up at 2am. It was so frustrating and I was so tired. I think my body just needed some time to recover. I've also been eating marginally healthier and drinking a lot of flavored sparkling water. Hopefully your body just needs some time to process the changes and catch up a little. Are you having problems falling asleep or staying asleep? Or just general tiredness?
General tiredness I've also started a new job where I get up at 5:45 and so I'm usually awake before then and it is a rough adjustment
