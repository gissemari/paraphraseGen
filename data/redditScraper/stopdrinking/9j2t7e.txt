  ..Over approximately the last three years of my plummet into alcoholism and isolation I experienced perpetual feelings of dread. This overpowering ambience typically struck me in the early mornings most frequently on my drive to work. I believe these feelings were rooted in stagnation. With no hope for tomorrow it became increasingly difficult to be excited about  today . I am speculating this as causal to these feelings of dread however I cannot be sure...As with many aspects of my life in which I was not meeting my expectations I blamed this entirely on alcohol. What I have realized in 20 months of sobriety is that while alcohol may have compounded consequences and cemented me in place many of my challenges in life were rooted far deeper. Abstaining from alcohol has proven tremendously easy for me and while once again I cannot be sure of exactly why this is I have some theories: I have had a fervor for new ideas and have successfully changed many of my core beliefs about how the world works I have set a clear vision for my life personally and professionally and I have been actively taking steps to align my path with my vision I have seen real positive change in my physical health and my mind state I have had the support encouragement and guidance of some amazing individuals that I respect and admire I try to help others when opportunity presents itself (and sometimes specifically seek opportunities)...I do however infrequently still experience eerily similar feelings of despair on my morning commute. These feelings are prone to make me question if any of this is worth the effort. I am trying to figure out if specific actions (or inaction) are leading to this feeling. For instance last night was a completely wasted evening. I did nothing productive my house is sort of messy I did not interact well with my children I didn't exercise yesterday and it was a wasted day. On the other hand I understand there is nothing wrong with having some recoup days. I cannot expect myself to be Mr. Improvement 24/7-365. Has anyone experienced similar emotional time warps? Where you feel JUST like you did while trapped in addiction? How do you interpret these feelings? Have you recognized anything that causes them?..One thing I've noticed as I watch people relapse and listen to relapse stories is that everyone seems to take their own anecdotal logical leap for what caused their relapse.  I wasn't praying   I left some stuff off of my fourth step  yada yada. I don't necessarily buy those things. It's pretty simple to me something goes off in the mind (the fuckits) that decides a tiny bit of happiness right now is worth all of the cost and consequence in the world. One understand their action is probably going to ruin their life but they are desperate to feel differently right then in that exact moment. I think many things can get us there. I think these feelings of dread are one of them...&amp;#x200B;..Note: Do not be alarmed I am not concerned about myself relapsing at this juncture. I just monitor my thoughts and attempt to evaluate and explore them. The practice of meditation helps me to let these thoughts happen without guilt and to let them pass without acting upon them. I obsessively monitor thoughts.

This happens to me kind of frequently.  I don't know why I'm like that.  I feel like I should probably get therapy but generally in therapy I clam up and have problems answering anything other than 'I'm fine'.  I don't know why I do that either...I have written a couple of times about my near compulsion to have a goal to work towards.  At first it was exercise I ran a couple of marathons.  However I need a new one.  If I don't have one I feel like I'm stagnating and I also get a whopping case of nihilism.  ..One thing that I was struck by with your share that I only recently read in someone else's was the idea that if I didn't 'accomplish' something it was a 'waste'.  I feel that way too.  I'm not sure it's healthy for me.  The share I read a little bit ago was someone saying that only when they were drunk/high could they finally just sit in a chair and relax.  I replaced that with only if I'm absolutely fucking physically and mentally exhausted can I sit down.  Neither are healthy.   Sorry I don't have anything better to say as far as 'how I overcame it' but I really like your share because it puts words to a feeling that swirls around me somehow right out of reach.  Thanks for that and IWNDWYT.
I have felt the same way lately.  My issue with alcohol was that it caused me to stagnate.  I could feel my life's potential seeping away.  I still feel this way when I am not actively engaged in my personal development.  Having the urge to always be better than former self causes me to feel anxious when I am not taking care of myself or actively making myself better than who I was yesterday.  I stopped working out around two months ago after I got sick for a week and coincidentally I have felt anxious ever since because I never resumed my workout routine.  I think the feeling of stagnation is inherent with alcoholism and so I sometimes have those recurrent feelings I had when I was drinking because I am stagnant despite being sober.  I think it's essentially what is commonly referred to in AA as a "dry drunk."  Hope you find the answers you seek! IWNDWYT
