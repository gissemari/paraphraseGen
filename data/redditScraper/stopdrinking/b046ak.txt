*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*..**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**..I'm pledging myself to not drinking today and invite you to do the same...Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others...It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours lets not drink alcohol!..---..**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!..What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up...**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning...**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread...---..This post goes up at: ..    US - Night/Early Morning .    Europe - Morning .    Asia and Australia - Evening/Night..A link to the current Daily Check-In post  can always be found near the top of the sidebar...---..*"Nothing is more important than that you see and love the beauty that is right in front of you or else you will have no defense against the ugliness that will hem you in and come at you in so many ways."* Neil Stephenson Anathem..I read this book Anathem shortly after I had quit drinking and was rediscovering my love of reading. It was an interesting book kind of a sci-fi philosophical save the world adventure with math. The above quote really stuck with me I internalized it and applied it to sobriety. The early days were hard but there were good moments too. The feeling of waking up without a hangover. Seeing beauty in nature. Enjoying a quiet moment or just feeling good without alcohol being involved. I held onto and loved those moments and when the hard times did come usually in the form of my own thoughts I remembered that there was good to be had too. Sometimes it's hard to love the beauty when life seems like everything is a struggle but it's still there and worth moving forward for. ..I hope everybody is able to see and feel the beauty all around. We're all here together today and I think that is a truly beautiful thing.
----------immediate responses--------

I didn't drink in Aus with you today and I won't tonight!
IWNDWYT 
My first thought when I woke up this morning was  I don't have to feel guilty this morning  and it was soooo freeing. Good morning I will not drink with you today!
IWND  WYT. No beauty in   . Beautiful healthy body and soul with no alcohol.
I love and appreciate this post so much! It made me take a big calm breath. Thank you. I will not drink tonight or tomorrow!
Morning everyone. IWNDWYT
Great timing. Just on witching hour in Aus. IWNDWYT. 
Morning you lovely bunch of coconuts I am looking forward to not drinking with you all today/tomorrow  ..I had a crazy productive day yesterday off to the gym this morning - I feel great! Didn't often get to say that when I was mainlining Chardonnay...Wishing you all strength and IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT
 IWNDWYT 
I will not drink with you today. I might be bored and anxious and angry and scared but alcohol isn't the answer. No thanks.
IWNDWYT  
I'm not drinking today with you all. Just got in from spending a few minutes in the blazing midday outdoors. Nature is beautiful and also brutal. The passionfruit plant is sprouting new tendrils the ivy is climbing in every which direction the eggplants are growing steadily. New beetroot and cherry tomatoes coming in. Grateful to be sober today. 
Good morning from Belgium!..Another fine day starts. My schedule for today is almost empty so I am able to fill it with what I like: finishing my book walking with the dogs... but no drinking for me!..IWNDWYT! 
Not sure what my counter says but today is going to be my 10th day without alcohol equalling my lifetime record...IWNDWYT
Iwndwyt. I didn't drink but I smoked yesterday which I really regret. Won't be touching that stuff again. Sobriety from all drugs and alcohol is important to me going forward. 
No drinking for me today! 
I will not drink with you today!
IWNDWYT 
I will not drink with you all today.
I will not drink with you today
No way Pedro IWNDWYT 
I will not drink with you today - first time I'm making this pledge after loosing everything yesterday I'm starting on the trail of soberity thank you 
Good morning.  Sleepless night tonight but no drinking today.
IWNDWYT
It's Tuesday night in Melbourne. I haven't had a beer in a week. Woo-hoo.
First day off work in two weeks!!! Gonna play PS4 clean the house walk the dog and generally chill so much my heart rate drops to dangerous levels. I will not be drinking. I will be enjoying myself instead 
Hey SD! I'm not drinking today...Wishing you a terrific Tuesday! :)
Checking in and not drinking today. Great quote Polarb3rry.
I will aim to see the beauty whereever it occurs today. AND I will not drink with you today.
No booze today!
Good morning friends. As per usual: I will not drink with you today. Stay strong everyone... 
Day 2 (again) and really hoping to get the the first week or some meaningful milestone. In previous attempts I found it was easier to say no to temptation when I could think "shame to blow a full week/10 days/a month sober". There is quite a symbolic event for me this weekend and if I can make that and these days running up to it sober then it will lay down a really important symbolic marker about not drinking...Only day 2 but how nice to wake after good quality sleep and not feeling foggy!..IWNDWYT x
No drinks today.. Peace
Not today Alcohol..IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT..I'm close to 100 days so I might as well get there. In pretty bad shape as far as stress/emotions but I am going to therapy tomorrow so I hope that helps...One day at a time... 
Morning troops. I'll join yous in not drinking today.
Good morning everyone...Yesterday sucked but there's silver linings. My friends are wonderful and I've found a counseling / support service locally that will take me on so I have a place to go to when it all gets too much...I'm counting this as a major success in one of my goals for this year which is to be more honest. I'm finally being honest with myself about what I need. :)..On another bright note - I told a friend of mine that I'd quit drinking for good. She asked for recommendations for how to quit herself! I sent her details of *This Naked Mind*...With all the downs come ups as long as you're sober enough to see them. I Will Not Drink With You Today SD :)
I will not drink todayhave a good day team.
I will not be drinking today
Morning SD IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT I may be checking in again around 5pm as thats when the brain kicks in thinking its alcohol time! 
IWNDWYT sober warriors.
I am still with you today ..I will not drink with you today 
Will not drink today.  
Wednesday evening here in AU. Feeling confident I can keep up a good attitude and make it through the weekend...But that's getting ahead of myself. Right now I'm focused on the next 24 hours. I did not drink today and I will not drink with you tomorrow. 
I will not drink with you today or tonight. I didn't drink yesterday and I got fantastic sleep. I feel.Pretty damn good this morning and not drinking is getting easier. Retraining the mind might take time but I'm happy to have the chance to do it instead of letting it go and take me further into unhealthiness 
Have a safe and sober day everyone! IWNDWYT 
I will not drink today.
I will not drink today.
I'm not sure if it's from the absence of alcohol or because of something else but my face has cleared up and I feel more hydrated than I have in months. Going to meeting tonight and I'm actually looking forward to it. Last week they helped me get through the weekend and I almost convinced myself I didn't need the meetings yesterday. But without them I wouldn't had made it through in the first place. IWNDWYT.
I will not drink with you today!
No drinking here!
IWNDWYT 
IWNDWYT
Not today. 
Big day at uni doing classes... glad I can take the office with me and get work done in between. Now buckling in for a big night of work and study. No booze today no booze tonight and I won't be drinking with y'all tomorrow either :).
I'm in. IWNDWYT  
Another fine day not to drink   
Day 31!!!.IWNDWYT!!!!!!! Happy Tuesday!
I will not drink with you today.
IWNDWYT 
Good morning everyone. IWNDWYT. 
Staying sober.
Count me in :)
I did NOT drink yesterday and will NOT drink today!!! IWNDWYT 
Not drinking with you today!..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;
Day 2 - last night I dreamt I drank a whole bottle of wine to myself and woke up thinking "oh no but I worked so hard all day" but Hah! I didn't! And I feel so happy about that. So here's to another day with no drinking today may pose more challenges but it's just one day. I can manage one day.
IWNDWYT!!    
I will not drink with you today. Stay true good people of SD   
IWNDWYT
Today I'm not going to let alcohol or negative thinking discolor the way I see the world...IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you today
I will not drink today.
I am sober. It's hard to believe it happened for me. But it did and I'm grateful every day. It takes work but I'm here and happy to be present for my daughter today. Life isn't perfect but drinking never made anything better. It always made things worse. Now I get to be free from a substance that hurts me...I will not drink with you today. 
Yesterday was day 4 and I was scared of my after work craving but I had a plan and I successfully stayed sober. Same plan today. I am not drinking today no matter what happens good or bad.
Good Morning! IWNDWYT. I can't seem to get the counter to work but this is Day 71 for me. Yesterday was possibly the most tempting day since the very beginning but I kept my promise to myself. Everyone have a wonderful day! 
I will not drink today.
IWNDWYT .
Having a hard time finding a reason to stay sober. It was going ok for some of the time but the last few weeks has been bad. I stopped going to 'work' altogether and have been ignoring (sleeping through) phone calls. I have never been this useless before. My house is falling apart and I don't know how to do anything about anything. I am not going to make another post like this here and will try find a more appropriate place. Thanks for anyone who helped me in the past I really appreciate it. Iwndwyt
Thanks so much pb. I can certainly relate that the hard times are quite often inside jobs...Good morning sober friends. We are here together. I am NOT alone. Still decompressing from an emotion filled weekend. Someone said..."It's not the burdens of everyday that drive men mad. It is the regret of yesterday and the fear of tomorrow. Regret and fear are twin thieves that rob us of today." Abby Warman said..."Take time for solitude. How else can you contemplate the blessings of recovery." I am grateful today for my alone time time to slow down and think a bit. It helps me to quiet the twin thieves to be able to truly enjoy my day. I will NOT drink with you today! Peace
IWNDWYT
Great check-in post /u/polarb3rry. I will see the beauty in today. I will not drink with you today.
Not today. Not today. Not today!!!
I will not drink with you today!
Glorious sober morning soberniks!  IWNDWYT 
No    for me today.  I have way too much to do and I want to have quality time with my nieces.  
No drinking for me today!
I will not drink today. 
No drinking today
Great post polarb3rry. I will not drink with you today. 
I made a post yesterday about my "healthy" relationship with alcohol that was leaving me not feeling so healthy - both in body and mind. I was worried to tell my husband I wanted to cut out drinking but he took it very well! After an amazing night's sleep I'm happy to say IWNDWYT! Looking forward to many more with you all. 
Last week began my sober journey and what I expect I be the longest two months of my life. Intensive outpatient therapy after work 3 nights a week therapy Tuesday night and Saturday morning and a meeting in Thursday. All while working full time and taking care of things at home with my wife pets and small child. ..I'm also not driving so I'm finding it hard to carve out the me time I need. Im still working on who my support system is and how they can help. Some are a little much so far only doing what they need and not what's best for them. ..I have stresses. I have triumphs. But no matter what today brings IWNDWYT 
IWNDWYT...Peace folks!
IWNDWYT!
not happening
It's been a week since my last drink and things feel good this time...My family knows I'm quitting and they're supportive which makes things far easier...I won't drink today. 
Checking in. In less than a month I'll have beaten my sober streak from 2018. I don't plan on messing it up this time since I can do one day at a time. I will stay free from alcohol today. 
I will not drink with you today!!.
It's been awhile since I checked in but I'm still sober and here! IWNDWYT!
No drinking today! Alchohol free and happy about it.
I will not drink today.
Hello everyone!  Busy day ahead no drinking for me!  
I haven't checked in every single day like I used to but I'm still sober! IWNDWYT 
IWNDWYT 
I will not drink with you today.
Day 4 in the books. Looking forward to losing track of the days if that's ever possible...Sleep schedule still massively messed up. Only could manage around 3.5 hours before an early flight I'm about to catch this morning. ..Got a sizable haircut yesterday after growing mine out for just under year. Instant regret lol. Sounds funny that Id get attached to  making progress  in growing hair when all I've had to do is just not get it cut. 
Good Morning SD I will not drink w/you today. 
Had a rough day at work yesturday not sure what im walking into today. One thing I am sure of is that IWNDT! And as long as i do that i am doing whats best for me and my family and I can sleep well at night!!! Thank you all for this group!!!!
I have an appointment with my therapist today. I really dread admitting that I relapsed a week ago (exactly a week ago today) but I suppose I'm only sabotaging myself if I'm not honest with the people who are trying to help me. I'm working on building up the courage to deal with that. Ironically/stupidly the anxiety around this kind of makes me want to drink but I know I can do better than that. I *must* do better than that. IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT.  
IWNDWYT
How do the cats KNOW it's daylight savings time?!?! I thought one benefit of  springing forward  would be that they'd stop waking me up an hour before my alarm but nope there they were at 6 sharp! I will snuggle these little shits before work and I will not drink with you today.
I will not drink today!
So true.  Thank you for posting. ..IWNDWYT
Just got home from a 28-day "retreat" and feeling better about life than I have in a long while
Happy Tuesday!  IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT
I will definitely not drink with you today. 
I will not drink today.
not drinking today!
Happy sober Tuesday!  No alcohol for me today!
I will not drink with you today.
Good morning from California!  39 days!  Heading to the gym.  I'm teaching spin class this morning so gotta finish my coffee check in with SD and off I go.  No booze sweat here!  IWNDWYT    Gigi 
I will not drink with you today. 
Beautiful post polarb3rry! Thank you for hosting. It's a beautiful morning and so nice to have slept well during the night and to wake up without crippling anxiety feeling like a zombie. It's the start of Day 4 for me and I feel good. IWNDWYT!
I will not drink today
I will not drink today!
That IS beautiful u/polarb3rry thank you! I will not drink with you today and I will remain vigilant  
I just want to say thanks for this sub and for each of you here. I'm feeling very grateful today. I never thought I'd want to live. I never thought I'd be able to enjoy life. And I never thought I'd look forward to the rest of my life. And I would never have felt this way when I was drinking. IWNDWYT. 
Nice quote polar. Most mornings I sit  have coffee and watch the sunrise. I live on  the top of an escarpment  with a big time view of the valley It connects me daily with nature our land and my family past and present.  It just didn't happen to the same extent  before I was sober. It was living in a fog. Here's to sobriety and seeing the beauty we live in. I will not drink with you today  
Morning! Heading into day 16. Feeling really good about what I've accomplished so far   I'm sleeping much better than I used to which is huge for me. It's nice to be able to pay attention to what my body/mind needs and know it isn't a direct result of alcohol. IWNDWYT! 
I will not drink today!
IWNDWYT! On my way to some painful dental work but then I have the whole day to whine and watch Netflix lol. If I had stayed on the path I was on with booze drugs and depression a few years ago I'd be losing all of my teeth. Now I'm working with a great dentist to repair them. It's an uphill battle but I'm very proud over time my smile and comfort is improving. Have a good day everyone! 
Today will not be the day I drop the ball.  
I will not drink with you today.
Today I'm a bit sad and tired. It's a sunny day and the city is preparing for a massive festival but everything seems a bit grey. ..I don't have any appetite and can skip meals without any hunger pangs. Wonder if it's a bit of depression. Either way with that and the alcohol I'm at my lowest weight for years (although still overweight) so that's something. 
I will not drink today.
I will not drink with you today! Have a great day everybody 
IWNDWYT 
Not drinking today guys!!
Sober day 1  - debilitating hangover.Sober day 2 - miserable day at work.Sober day 3 - today. I had a really crappy night of not enough sleep but feeling   percent better than day 1 &amp; 2!  .I will def not be drinking today! Coffee time  
Day 4 here -- typically Tues is when I go out for beer and wings with my buddies but for now it is likely best to avoid triggers like that. Gonna have a productive day then chill with my girlfriend. Iwndwyt
IWNDWYT 
ooohhh I am adding that to my read me list. ty!..Not drinking today but I will go to school and then the dentist - hit the gym and a meeting. &lt;3..[High Five](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg)

Made it a week! It's a small accomplishment but I'm really proud of myself...IWNDWYT
I have been soooo happy waking up sober. IWNDWYT
Day 8 today. 2lbs down on the scale $80+ saved. Life is good. IWNDWYT 
I'm feeling good about not drinking going into this work week. After drinking heavily Saturday evening I started reading Infinite Jest this Sunday for r/sdbookclub and it'll be my sober buddy on breaks and after work...The weather's nice all week for the first time in months so I can sit outside and read and watch normal sober people do normal sober people things and feel like a normal sober person myself. ..I won't drink with you today or all this week. This time around I won't commit to not drinking next weekend because I've tried and tried and the odds aren't great. So I'll commit to this week because I think I can do it. I'll punt my weekend commitment to Saturday Mashaka and hope he's in a good place and makes the right decision. 
Will not drink today..
A beautiful day northeastern US. Going to enjoy every minute of it. IWNDWYT! 
 Try not to become a person of success but rather try to become a person of value.  Albert Einstein .I will not drink with y'all today!! 
IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT
I won't be drinking with you wonderful people today  
Good morning everyone. I haven't checked in for a while but I've been staying strong and abstaining despite the cravings being pretty bad the last couple days. It was rough and there were a few times where I thought "Eh it's just one" but ultimately reminded myself that one will turn into 10 and I will be worse for wear the next day. Closing in on a month and I can't wait to cross that line. ..IWNDWYT!
Hooray. I'm not going to drink today....So there!
Not drinking today
I will not drink with you today! 
I woke up late for work today because I slept through my alarm but instead of it being because I was hungover from the night before I was actually sober and just TIRED AF lol I'm glad to not be hungover today  
Not today ISIS!!!
All kinds of prompts to drink yesterday but I made it. Time to face another day. 
I will not drink today.
 I will not drink with you today! 
***IWNDWYT ***

I will not be drinking with you today  
IWNDWYT!
I will not drink with you today.   
I am still struggling today. I can't say I want to drink because I have no desire to do anything. Which I guess is better than the desire to drink. ..&amp;#x200B;..I will not drink with you today. 
Headed to SMART tonight.  Looking forward to connecting w the group later on.  Not drinking today.  
Been a little lazy and unwell the last week. This will pass. I will not drink today  
I will not drink today
IWNDWYT - Every day is easier and every day I surprise myself with what I'm able to accomplish that I otherwise wouldn't have. Thanks for being there for me friends.
I will not drink with you today!
IWNDWYT!..Tonight I'm going on a date with someone. I've gone on two dates with him and I was really embarrassed Saturday night when he was home snuggling with his kid and I was drunk texting him. I'm so happy to be on my sober journey and I'm hoping he appreciates it when I talk with him about it.  
IWNDWYT
Day 4 I am not drinking today.

Come what may I won't drink today. It can't help me and will likely hurt me.
IWNDWYT
Keep on keeping on! IWNDWYT
This marks ten weeks. IWNDWYT 
Good morning! I will not drink with you today. I had a dream last night about my 20 year high school reunion which is coming up in about six weeks. I wasn't planning to go because I want to bring my husband and don't have childcare then I realized I can go by myself. My first thought was about whether to drink at the event.   I didn't drink (much) in high school so there's no reason I can't go to the reunion without drinking. And there's plenty of reasons to do so (mainly that I have a much lower chance of embarrassing myself!)
I'm back to day 1 after another weeklong binge last week. I absolutely will not drink today.
IWNDWYT   
It's been a rough few days over here. However a shitty day sober is still better than a shitty day hungover/drinking ..IWNDWYT  
I'm not drinking today no matter what happens no matter how I feel.
Not drinking today!
Good morning. ..I will not be drinking with you today and I will never drink again and I will never change my mind. 
Just for today I'm not drinking. Not falling into the psychological bullshit hole of thinking ahead.
IWNDWYT 
I will not drink today!!!
IWNDWYT!!   
Not today.
iwndwyt
Been a while since I checked in but I had drinking dreams back to back the last two nights; so just staying vigilant. Luckily both time were more like nightmares because I blacked out in my dreams and did stupid stuff like break a lamp miss a flight and make a fool of myself; so even when I relapse on my dreams I know it is an awful idea.
I will not drink with you all today!.
This is a great post I live in a beautiful place but if you just look down at your feet you never see it. Sometimes you have to look up! Perhaps that is the difference this time for me I have truly stopped drinking vs quitting for a bit. I don't feel like I am missing out on anything and I LOVE the feeling of waking up fresh! IWNDWYT! 
I will not drink today. 328 days sober! 
Good morning world!!! Last night I told my wife that I was taking a break from drinking that I can't control it. She was very supportive.  Not the complete truth but baby steps. Thanks loving family of SD I would not be here without you. Bring on day 7 I'm ready...IWNDWYT.
Not drinking today.
Good morning. I will not drink with you all today. It is Spring Break and I am having a wonderful staycation so far. Honestly it might beat the disappointing cruise I took last year. Btw this might be one of the underrated  good points of having kids - you get excited about Spring Break summer vacation and the other holidays all over again. I mean all the stuff about making your life more meaningful is true but also Spring Break!
Good morning all! Hope everyone has a great day! I will not today!
  .Good morning.  It's been a long time and many starts and stops since I've been here but I'm back and I will not drink today.  Thank you for being here.
Good morning. Time for coffee and a rainy day with toddler and dog. It's all good though I will not drink with you today.
This takes a daily commitment. And today I am committed. Or I should be. Either way I am staying sober! ODAAT! IWNDWYT! 
Woke up to a stressful morning I'm going to try to not let it ruin my mood. I will not drink with you today.
Not drinking today!
I will not drink poison with you all today..
It's my actual real life Birthday today.  I'm 41. ..When I was about to turn 40 I told myself that enough was enough and I was going to stop drinking for my birthday gift to myself.  It took a bender that almost killed me a couple of months later but I'm doing it.   This has been the best year of my adult life since I started drinking.   IWNDWYT 
IWNDWYT! Day 2.  Feeling good!.Stay strong everybody.
/u/polarb3rry _Anathem_ is such a cool read!  What other books have you found like that?..Toddler is well on his way to recovery (thanks antibiotics) but my Kindergartner may or may not be sick now (can't tell if he's trying to duck out of school or genuinely sickish)...Went to bed super-early last night so lots of morning prep was left for me to do this morning.  Gotta go get to it!..IWNDWYT
Checking in...... IWNDWYT 
I will not drink with you today!
About to start a day working hard on a big carpentry project enjoying being calm on day 3 and feeling ready to work with no hangover. IWNDWYT

I slept well and I woke up without guilt and dread. I'm going to bed sober again tonight and I am excited for it.
This time change is killing me. But day 15 IWNDWYT. 
waking up an hour early (daylight savings) is hard enough without a hangover so I will not drink today.
Feeling good no reason to drink don't want to drink. Happy Tuesday! IWNDWYT  
Day 163 of not drinking. IWNDWYT

Gonna try to breathe through it apply myself at work up my magnesium dosage start sleeping in the other bedroom where the noise is not so bad hit my yoga mat and most importantly iWNDWYT 
IWNDWYT

Hi all. Happy Tuesday! IWNDWYT!
I will not drink tonight. Big work days for me today and tomorrow. 
IWNDWYT! I'm on one of my longest streaks and I'm not about to break it.
After many days of intense anxiety and depression a curtain seems to have lifted this morning. I feel positive energetic and clear headed. So freaking happy to be sober and planning on staying that way. IWNDWYT. 
Good morning! Today is day 23 for me! The time change is making it more difficult for me to wake up but with the later sunrise I was fortunate enough to see a gorgeous rainbow this morning. Enjoy the little things! IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT folks. Have an amazing day!
IWNDWYT.  Day 2.
Sun is out and feeling good this Tuesday!  IWNDWYT
Day 4 ..My Sons Bday today. It was so great to be able to wake up early and be apart of all the morning festivities. My wife said don't go upstairs without me we have a tradition...... I had never been apart of or even aware of this tradition because I was either working or hungover and wouldn't get out of bed. ..My insomnia has been so bad. I have only been sleeping like 2 hours a night hot/cold flashes no appetite tons of night sweats etc. I also think I got anxiety yesterday I felt so weird in my own sober skin it was slightly unpleasant and disorienting. ..I am now 4 days free of alcohol cannabjs and nicotine. I have used cannabis multiple times daily for over 15 years and I had no idea how physically dependent my body appears to be..... ..Also on the upside I got to sleep in my bed last night. Wife is still terrified hurt and can hardly look at me much less have any sort of physical contact with me but progress is progress and I'll take what I can get. ..IWNDWYT

Day 77. My main struggle right now is boredom. Sobriety gives you a lot of free time in the evenings and weekends. For boredom the past few days I've been pouring a lot of time and energy into FL Studio. Alcohol is an obsession right? So it makes sense that I would make a new obsession. FWNDWYT!
I will not drink with you today!
I will not drink TODAY no matter what happens good or bad!
Been feeling pretty isolated lately. A drink with drinking buddies wont solve that feeling. I will not drink with you today.
Decided to make some goals and actually act on reaching them!  iwndwyt!
Gotten around to this late been sort of a stressful morning. No matter what I will not drink today.
Day 3. Feels good! IWNDWYT
First time on here.  It's great to see everyone being so supportive.  I will not be drinking today.
If I get through today it will be the first time in 5 years that I actually make it a week without drinking. Last Tuesday I had one of the worst nights of my life by letting my anxiety steamroll me into making horrendous decisions. While I've recovered from that I know that the weeks leading up to there caused a lot of problems for me. I don't know how long I'm going to stay sober I don't know if I want to be dry forever but I do know I have a lot to work on within myself before I take another sip. ..&amp;#x200B;..I'm working through counseling. I'm keeping my partner and housemate up to date. I'm learning to rebuild a community that isn't revolved around me going to the pub and bars to people watch because I'm stressed. Normally I'm fine with alcohol. But when I'm not I'm NOT. And playing Russian Roulette with those I love is unacceptable to me...&amp;#x200B;..I will stay sober today because I have to. Today is going to be hard. Yesterday I was emotional and crying for hours. My anxiety is always high and it seems like it's only climbing higher. But I am loved and I can do this.

I read  a post on the SD thread today. The writer speaks of how their drinking just kept escalating. One to two drinks turned into three and four. Then to a bottle a night to multiple bottles on the weekends. When the wine started to cause physical issues they switched to beer. I can relate. Beer was my first choice but when it started to take four to five cans to get the buzz I was chasing I started to drink whiskey. Once I hit the buzz it was all I could do to keep it going. I thought I was in control. My family noticed. My wife with her own issues with alcohol was dragged in with me. When she finally made the decision to get better she had to get away from me because I did not recognize my problem. Now as I am sitting here alone without her and the kids reading through the pain that others have endured I can see how alcohol just made my already injured mind get worse. How I would give anything to turn back the clock and tell my younger self that alcohol is so insidious. I would have been better off just playing in traffic. ..This week feels more like a year as if I've been sentenced to prison yet it was alcohol that was my prison. One of my own making. I am seeing now that it is up to me to make the change. I'm going to my first Celebrate Recovery meeting tonight and look forward to a better me. I want to be there for my kids. I want to earn the chance to show them and my wife that I can be the man and father that God wants me to be. ..Right now the hardest part is the noise in my head. My anxiety is already crippling and the alcohol did not help. The doctors told me that I shouldn't drink with the medication I was prescribed yet I continued. How long will it take to reach some sort of normalcy? I don't know but I am committed to the path. Fear of the unknown feeds my anxiety. Alcohol allowed me to shut the noise out. Now I am just trying to find constructive means of doing so without drinking. I am a religious person and have a strong belief in God. Though I have been taught that through Him I should not fear think Psalms 24 I just cannot shake the fear. Hopefully now on day 6 my medication will start to work.  I want to better understand the triggers that cause me chase down that drink and find ways to better handle them...&amp;#x200B;..Thank you for being here.
I will not drink with you today.

I will not drink today.
42 days (six weeks)! I'm going to visit my sister tomorrow. It's the first time I've been out of state in over two years. Alcohol prevented me from traveling. I'm going to go wedding dress shopping while there. I hate that my body isn't what I want it to be (overweight). I am trying to stay centered in grace and appreciate how strong and how forgiving my body has been and find beauty in that. IWNDWYT

Had a productive day of reading and practicing guitar. So much nicer being able to enjoy a week off without spending the day meditating on what you're going to drink at night. About to go to my girlfriend's apartment and have a cozy night in. ..IWNDWYT
Today was not my day. Not by a long shot. But I know drinking is not an option...I don't even particularly want to drink right now so it's nice to see some progress in my acceptance of being an alcoholic. Not an option at all..IWNDWYT
I had a ~~good~~ *great* day today. Which would not have been had I wasted it being intoxicated. ..I hereby resolve not to waste tomorrow either.
After an embarrassing end to a party on Saturday my husband and I have decided to cut out alcohol (95% because of me).  So today I will not drink.
