Yes one week and top it with an extra day. Sobriety has waxed and waned with ease and difficulty. Sometimes I'm sad - not another day with wine but then not drinking has led to better sleep more concentration more productivity and dare I say... I'm funnier than I was before?! There have been moments of awkwardness. I told a friend I was on here and she replied "you really need support"? To which I say YES. I have a problem I tried to do it alone I can't. Then someone asked do I drink? - uh I'm taking a break? Idk Im not into telling everyone - Well actually the struggle is real right now. Besides that the only other observation is reading others temptations relapses and near misses and realizing yeah ... I am never going to be able to moderate. I am not wired that way. So here is to being forever sober and figuring out that its gonna be fine. PS what do y'all do to relax instead?.
