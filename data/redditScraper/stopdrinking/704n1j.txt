This is the longest amount of sobriety I have ever achieved and it is not my first try. On my last try that lasted more than a week I made a promise to myself that if I couldn't do it then I would ask for help. The first time I failed after making that promise then I didn't seek medical help but I did the next time (this time)...It has gotten so much easier to say no and to stay on track. The cravings have been mild and easy to manage.... but I do still worry that I could relapse again which in my experience has lasted months at a time and been life threatening. So I am making a new promise to myself: if I relapse again then I will go to rehab.

Glad to hear you have gone this long; that is an amazing accomplishment in itself; and it takes a lot of courage to make this promise to yourself!  I won't drink with you today.
Congrats on 79 days.  I won 't drink with you today.
