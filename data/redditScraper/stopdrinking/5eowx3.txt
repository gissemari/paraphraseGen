I have been struggling the past few months. I had some sober time then started eating myself alive with ambivalence about drinking. I relapsed and came back. ..Today it feels good. I don't ever have to drink again. Starting where I did it is a miracle that I feel that way today. I barely remember last Thanksgiving but I know I was miserable.  ..Today I will raise a glass of sparkling water to being happy and living life.
