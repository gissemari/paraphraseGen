I haven't drank in six months. ..Life has not been great. .Last summer I began to drink daily. I always rationed out how many drinks I would have and to my credit I stuck with my rationing. Of course no matter how many ways I tried to normalize my nightly rituals I was still diving deeper and deeper into alcoholism. My alcohol use continued as I attended my classes. I began to become to busy with work I started to only drink on the weekends but soon that all changed. ..In mid October I was sexually assaulted by a person who I saw as a very close friend. My partner soon came forward to me and told me that he'd assaulted them too a few weeks ago. I began to drink every night going out to buy a new liter of vodka every week then every few days. I fell behind in every class I was taking. A's quickly turned to D's and F's. I physically couldn't get out of bed. I couldn't eat. I couldn't sleep. Life began to be a daily struggle to stay alive. I thought to myself that if the alcohol didn't kill me first I would. I began having flashbacks and hearing voices telling me I was crazy. My life remained in this utter chaos for months...---..It was January third and I was on my break which consisted of me fighting to bring my grades back up. My partner and I were still waiting to hear our case results regarding any disciplinary action against he who shall not be named. I was with friends and drinking socially (a rare event) until it was pretty late. They soon turned in for the night and I stayed up alone thinking. My life was shit. I remember feeling almost amazed in that moment that I was still even alive. I started to remember my life before everything happened it sure wasn't good by most people's standards but everything seemed "okay.". .I began to have flashbacks of when he touched me..What he said to me. .My frozen body..I felt the urge to go into the kitchen and dive a knife deep into my chest. I began to feel terrified of my thoughts. For the first time in my life I realized the poison was going to kill me. ..I walked into the bathroom and looked into the mirror and I didn't recognize what I saw. ..I saw death...It was then that I experienced one of my worst auditory hallucinations. It was the voice of a woman. Screaming - non-stop - not even stopping to breathe for what seemed like days. I crotched on the floor to cover my ears but the screams only grew louder. ..I haven't drank since that day...But life wasn't great after I became sober...I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia and PTSD - but I didn't drink...My partner attempted to jump to their death in front of me - but I didn't drink...I hurt myself - but I didn't drink...I experienced psychosis - but I didn't drink...Nearly everyday I struggle to see the difference between reality and the lies my mind conjures. I still hear see smell feel and taste things that are not there. I still get ..I still hurt. But I choose not to drink.

Very brave. Thank you for your courage. 
You have a lot going on.  But it's a testament to the strength of your will that you have stayed sober for 6 months and are continuing to fight the lies your brain tells you.  I do not have schizophrenia but nonetheless my brain--and I think many of the alcohol addicts here have the same experience--continually lies to me and tells me that I can have a moderate number of drinks like two in an hour or two.  But it almost never works that way and I will end up having 8-12 or more if I start.  It's great that you know it's a lie  and I'm inspired by your determination to keep plugging away and ignoring the lies.  Good for you and keep it up!  I will join you in not drinking today.
