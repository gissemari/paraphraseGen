I haven't posted here in so long. Things have been less than stellar. My girlfriend and I got in a fight on St. Paddy's Day and I used it as an excuse to relapse. Just been downhill since. I said horrible disgusting things to her and to say I really screwed up is putting it lightly. Almost lost my job lost my girl. I miss her more than anything but she wants nothing to do with me until I'm sober. So this is it my new Day 1. I will not drink today.
