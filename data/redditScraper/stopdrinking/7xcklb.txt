I just turned 23 recently and I think it finally clicked in my brain that I need to stop. I've been drunk 6 out of the 7 days of the week for the last few years if not everyday and it's slowly gotten worse I'm frequency and amount. I've put a strain on myself my relationships and my work life. Luckily my boss has worked with me and not fired me for being late so often and coming in hungover...This'll be my second attempt in the last few weeks. I relapsed the first time just from going out with friends for a night. ..Hopefully I can make it this time. No more for me.

You can do it!   At least you realize what needs to be done. IWNDWYT! 
I know exactly where you're coming from I'm 24 and right after I turned 21 I started drinking every night more and more then I stopped made it a few months then relapsed and kept going even though it was just on the weekend but I still drank till I was black out drunk and passed out. But even if you mess up I guess the important thing is to keep trying.
If you already feel like this..try and stop now.  At 39 I can tell you the shit gets worse.  I've done some shit I never would have imagined at your age.
I hope you can succeed in this! I'm around your age and have had to cut back as well. The most important thing is having a great support system. I had to stop hanging out with the people who push me into wanting to drink a lot even if they were a lot of fun. They don't really get why I stopped seeing them as much lol. But I had to take care of work and my relationship and also my relationships with family members ..So great friends and definitely a great boyfriend/girlfriend (whichever you have) helps a lot in overcoming this!
