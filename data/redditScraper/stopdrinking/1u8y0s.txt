I've been in a semi-state of denial about my drinking habits and after drinking last night (nothing unusual happened) I finally was able to say out loud to my mom that I am an alcoholic. I have decided to go to my first AA meeting and from reading all of your posts it seems to be quite a helpful platform. I wanted to say thank you to all those who have shared your stories it makes me realize I really am not alone in this struggle...

Good choice! Be sure and check out different meetings. Choose them by neighborhoods that you are comfortable in.
