So this is a little weird but it makes sense.  I used to have a terrible habit of leaving my contacts in overnight...especially easy since I was basically passing out.  Truth is it never really bothered me unless I did it many nights in a row I could wake up feeling crappy but I could see fine and no irritation from lesvig them in. What I have noticed now if I do this not drinking I wake up the next morning my eyes are a disguisting goopy mess. This is rather profound to me because it proves my body likely was focusing on metabolizing the shit I drank and not worrying about my eyes is all I can figure. Gemerally I am mindful now anyways and remember to remove them earlier in the evening  but just thought I would share because having relapsed over and over I noticed this occurs everytime. Seems to prove to me how my body was not being given the chance to do what its supposed to do...Not drinking today! and hopefully someone will appreciate the sillyness of this accidental test I have conducted lol

That's interesting! Today will be my 10th sober day and I read that it takes alcohol up to 240 hours  or 10 days to leave your system completely. I feel like I am not as sharp as I used to be particularly like I can't focus on reading as well and am wondering how my brain and body will change when the path is cleared to start healing. Here's to letting our amazing bodies do what they are supposed to do! I'll not drink with you today!
