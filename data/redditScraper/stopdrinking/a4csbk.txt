Initially being sober was so hard. Those first days and weeks I struggled. I didn't go to meetings or anything I just white knuckled it...Now after I'm over 7 months it feels almost too easy. Is this just just addition playing tricks on me?..I've never gone to meetings or had any help - I just don't drink...Was I really an alcoholic or was I just coping poorly through a difficult time?

Congratulations on accomplishing your goal!  ..I would ask you....does it really even matter if you were alcoholic or not?  Just be mindful of that mind game and if it leads you back to a place where you pick up a drink - you may find yourself seeking the same answer all over again!..The freedom you are feeling is wonderful!  If that road feels good stay on it!..
The fact that you are questioning if you were an alcoholic is a red flag a big one.   Alcoholism is patient and sneaky.   It will use this to suggest that maybe you could have one drink.   We have much experience in how that turns out.    ..
It's simple. I was addicted to alcohol. I quit. And now I'm not addicted. But those neural pathways formed by the addiction didn't just disappear. If I start drinking again even if I attempt moderation I will fall right back into addiction. It's happened to many on this sub and it happened to me before I realized my mistake and quit for good...The only "trick" is to not recognize how better life has been without alcohol how we don't need it and to ever consider falling back into addiction.
It feels easy most days for me too. That I think is the magic of one day at a time.  It gets easier.  But I have to keep going one day at a time.  I know one drink will take me back to my lowest point so very fast.  Wishing you the best! IWNDWYT
