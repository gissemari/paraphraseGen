I answer my phone when it rings now. I'm not afraid of who might be calling because I now pay my bills on time. ..I also answer my phone because people from the program might need help. I had a man call me today from a number I didn't recognize before I would wait and listen for a message if none was left I'd leave it that. This guy was struggling.  He has 15 months sober but he's thinking about using Marijuana. He has been an inspiration for me because I've seen the incredible changes in him in the last year. I was there to talk to him.  He shared he had called several other people and no one picked up. Who knows if he would have tried anyone after me had I been too afraid to answer. ..Glad I was able to be there for someone in need. I was having a downer type day. Really unmotivated. Couldn't bring myself to do much. That conversation saved the day from being a Zero day and has me excited about tomorrow.

Aw. This is a nice story! I often don't answer my phone. You've given me good reasons to change that bad habit.
That's really great!  That's what teamwork in sobriety is all about.
Damn right!..I used to be petrified of answering my phone. Not for any good reason either. No one was angry with me I didn't owe any money I hadn't really burned any bridges yet... people just wanted to *talk* to me...In my drinking I suffered from even worse social anxiety than I do now and the thought of talking to people really was a horrifying prospect. ..Somehow finding a home group being 70+ days into my 90 in 90 getting a sponsor doing some work and making friends in the program has helped my ass break that habit. I even *call* people now. Of my own volition. ..The anxiety is still there to be sure but I both recognize and deal with it like any other illness...Good on you man.
