I'm approaching four years of sobriety and feel very solid in my recovery. In the back of my mind I've always worried that two events could send me into a relapse: losing my job or losing a loved one...This month I was notified that my position would be eliminated at the end of the year. I'm not alone--50 of my co workers are in the same boat. As I drove home on the day I got the news I passed several liquor stores. I had a fleeting thought that I should turn into one of them but I kept going...It's been almost a month since I received notice of the layoff and I still haven't cracked. My favorite part of sobriety is proving myself wrong. When I quit I was only planning to take a 30-day break. At the end of 30 days I didn't want to go back to drinking--I wanted to see how far I could stretch this thing. Today I never plan to drink again...I guess the point in trying to make is simple and a little cheesy: expect more of yourself. Believe you can do this. Don't set up worst case scenarios in your mind where drinking would be "justified." Just move forward one day at a time.

Great post. Thanks for reminding me that I'm still in control of my own actions even in times of adversity.
