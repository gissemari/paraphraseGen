Reading this made me think of all my family friends and wife have been through. [Here is the full article](https://www.vogue.com/article/philip-seymour-hoffman-mimi-odonnell-vogue-january-2018-issue). I thought some passages really stood out and were sobering and heartbreaking...&gt;Twelve-step literature describes addiction as  cunning baffling and powerful.  It is all three. I hesitate to ascribe Phil's relapse after two decades to any one thing or even to a series of things because the stressors or in the parlance triggers that preceded it didn't cause him to start using again any more than being a child of divorce did. Lots of people go through difficult life events. Only addicts start taking drugs to blunt the pain of them. And Phil was an addict though at the time I didn't fully understand that addiction is always lurking just below the surface looking for a moment of weakness to come roaring back to life...&gt;The first tangible sign came when out of nowhere Phil said to me  I've been thinking I want to try to have a drink again. What do you think?  I thought it was a terrible idea and I said so. Sobriety had been the center of Phil's life for over 20 years so this was definitely a red flag. He started having a drink or two without it seeming a big deal but the moment drugs came into play I confronted Phil who admitted that he'd gotten ahold of some prescription opioids. He told me that it was just this one time and that it wouldn't happen again. It scared him enough that for a while he kept his word...&gt;When Phil came back in November he wanted so badly to stay sober and for the next three months he did. But it was a struggle heartbreaking to watch. For the first time I realized that his addiction was bigger than either of us. I bowed my head and thought I can't fix this. It was the moment that I let go. I told him  I can't monitor you all the time. I love you I'm here for you and I'll always be here for you. But I can't save you. ..Worth a read for the perspective. It made a pretty solid impact on me.

Addiction has a plan: destroy my relationships ruin my life and kill me...Sometimes the order varies.
Thank you so much for finding this. God he was great. So special..This article was so well written and moving. Still wiping the tears away. I found myself wishing that this was a book. It is so unbelievable how powerfully destructive yet seductive addiction is..Impact also felt.
