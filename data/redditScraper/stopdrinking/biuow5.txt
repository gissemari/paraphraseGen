It clicked a bit today. I've been seeing a therapist for a few months and digging through/into some shit about me I didn't know. Drinking is something I've struggled with for a while...Things I've learned about me that led to my epiphany:.- Introverted is an understatement. I have the social battery of an old potato..- I don't value myself so when others need me I give up my happiness to lend them support (I'll do this ad infinitum).- I drink more after frustrating exhausting or days where I'm angry way more than a "normal day". Like "drink until I forget today happened and I can't remember going to bed tomorrow"...When it's just typed out like that it feels so simple  but I'm so happy I found the pattern I could cry (almost have but I'm at work). The way it works 4-6 days a week I interact with people help people (IRL is different than internet - I can take a breather to respond to folks online harder when they're staring at your RBF). Then I don't get a break to destress. When I do I'm not just out of social battery but negative. Drinking makes me feel relaxed so I drink myself stupid. The hangover the next day gives me a bit more of a reason to interact with folks less. Rinse and repeat...I don't know what self care looks like to be honest. That's something I've been working through really hard with therapy. But I value it more now than I think I ever have...I still need to learn how to tell folks I don't have the emotional bandwidth and how to relax and put myself first. But I can do that without alcohol...I'm going to Rocklahoma in a little under a month. I'm going to resolve to not drink until then (if I get shaky or start feeling bad I WILL begin a taper I'm scared of withdrawals). ..IWNDWYT!!

Glad you found your trigger. I was scared of withdrawls too. It was not as bad as I thought it would be thank goodness. They are not fun but for me doeable. Everyone is different and each of us has to access our own situation. IWNDWYT
