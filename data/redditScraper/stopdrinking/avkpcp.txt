I didn't drink for 4 months and I finally cracked. Thankfully I have a good support system and I was able to stop myself after day 2. I thought I was doing well on my sober journey but I guess I needed a reminder that every day is a struggle. Alcohol is a problem with me and I need to admit that. Back on track and going to the gym tomorrow IWNDWYT

From reading here it happens to a lot of us...I've certainly had enough relapses in the past...But and this is the key thing I can stop myself now. It doesn't go into days or week's benders anymore...And I use each slip to reinforce to myself that drinking just does nothing good for me...&amp;#x200B;..Good luck!
Good for you!  A good lesson learned I'm sure...IWNDWYT
I think reading your post is a message for me. This weekend will be the first time my SO is going out of town since I stopped drinking. And of course being alone is huge trigger for me. I was just thinking "I can handle a little wine right?" I hate to admit that I probably can't handle ANY wine. Or any alcohol. I also hate to admit that I'm a little sad about that. &lt;sigh&gt;..Thanks for your post- IWNDWYT.
Slips are normal. Back on wagon!
You were doing well on your sober journey! You just took a detour. Happens to the best of us back on the right path!
