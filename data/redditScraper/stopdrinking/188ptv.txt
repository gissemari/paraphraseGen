Just wanted to throw out there to this great subreddit that I had to reset my badge today to 2/1/13...For the 3rd time in a year and 2nd time in 4 months I've relapsed on prescription medication.  This last time I took just one extra dose of the stuff but in speaking with my sponsor realized that it was relapse behavior as my motivation was to get a buzz on.  Which I did...It makes little sense to me that I can be so strong about not drinking (haven't had a sip since day 1 of AA 1.5 years ago) but am seemingly powerless over prescription meds...Togther my sponsor and I came to the conclusion that I can no longer take prescription meds..unless it's absolutely necessary and administered by a doctor...I am upset by this but motivated to stay in the program. ..I really want this to be the last time...Thanks for listening all.  I lurk constantly and really do love /r/stopdrinking.

It helps me to frame my other cravings in the twelve steps. I think about the feelings and desires in myself that cause me to crave. What times in my life do I feel like altering my mind? I don't know much but I know that my real problem is a "thinking" problem. In the past I would use booze to alter my consciousness and hide my insecurity but it's entirely possible to do that with food sex medication damn near anything. Glad you're here man keep coming back. 
Thankfully I have never had any other addictions other than the booze (maybe reddit?).  When I hear people talking about relapsing on prescription meds they are usually directed toward NA.  Not because we don't want to help but because they have a much better understanding of the problem and know how to deal with it.  Glad to hear you have a sponsor as it is what eventually got me sober.  Not the sponsor but the help he gave me.  I wish you well my friend.  There are other subs on reddit as well on the right of this post.  Good luck my friend....http://www.na.org/

Are these actually prescribed to you or are you getting them from someone else / buying them? If they're prescribed does your prescriber know about your alcoholism / history of addiction? If not tell them. Be honest. See if there are alternatives.
