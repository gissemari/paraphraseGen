So woke this morning after a 4 day bender after staying sober and feeling great for 28 days. Really struggling to understand why I choose to walk in to a bar last saturday instead of hitting the gym as planned. So a bit more broke a little bit fatter and a few less braincellls than this time last week but fuck it I will not give up on this shit. However I might give the doctor a call today and ask for help. I'm starting to doubt I can do this by myself something a sane person might have realised a few years ago...Anyway stay strong friends and  thanks for being here! .IWNDWYT!!

Reaching out for help is a good idea.  I'm right at 27 days.  I have relapsed many times. I think two things are what I need to guard against.  One in impulsive drinking.  Sometimes a random thing a commercial a memory or any association will make me think about drinking.  It can catch me off guard and I'm drinking before I know it.  So I decided to always give myself time...wait five minutes an hour whatever before making a decision.  That helps make a better decision.  The most important thing for me is changing my romanticized view of drinking that it is something magical.  It's not for me.  I stopped having fun drinking a long time ago.  I remind myself it is not that great.  I really am not missing out on anything and I gain so much.  That's what helped me so far.  Good luck to you!
I think that consulting a doctor is a great idea. Hooray for you not losing the will!
I am 100% with you..... I had my last drink on 2/15 and broke the dry run on 3/17. Drank all day Sunday and Monday. I feel terrible and wish that I had not. I am beginning again. Day 1 was Tuesday. I'm looking forward to the weekend to gather myself and reflect a little more on the whys and get back to gym.     good luck iwndwyt
