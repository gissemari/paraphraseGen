I hope this post does not get relegated to AA forums because I desperately hope more people see it: this is an addiction issue that relates to alcohol abuse...I want as much TOUGH LOVE and honest as possible because I am not sure where to turn...I'm almost 50 and have (had?) 14 years of sobriety from alcohol thanks to AA.  Prior to getting sober I did not take any drugs: no pot no coke no meth no prescription meds. My problem was (is) with alcohol...I suffer from chronic migraines as well as advanced chronic peridontitis (gum disease).  Two surgeries (most recent almost four years ago) have happened on my gums.  ..It's under control with very tight (3 month) visits for DEEP cleaning (under local anes.) Since my last surgery nerve damage was shot off the charts (I used to tolerate deep scaling with ZERO local - I have a high pain tolerance).  Because of the pain after the local wears off my dentist has always made sure I have norco or vicodin as the suggestion of "go home and have a few glasses of wine" is not feasible. I kept the meds under the control of my partner and took them one day usually on top of 600 mg ibuprofen and salt water...Never got into trouble until my migraine pain got out of control.  I see a neurologist. Tried three preventatives.  They are debilitating. Also doing botox.  ..I got into trouble with a drug called fioricet (it has a barbiturate in it) a couple years ago. They also have given me opiates as a "rescue" as I was having to go to the ER when my migraines did not respond to medication.  I rarely get opiate meds (with good reason) from the neurologist (like 10 pills every 6 weeks) but fioricet they gave out like candy...I misused the barbiturate and came clean to my sponsor. I had to reset my sobriety date even though I did not drink (I did think about it when I realized I had to start over - alcoholic brain said "wtf if you have to start over might as well drink" but I had enough sobriety to say - no stop that's a death sentence.")..Quitting prescription medication has been a cake walk compared to stopping drinking.  I was in the habit of taking the barbiturate instead of a triptan because it did not make me tired. Wrong reasons. I overused it and took it too frequently. I am committed not to use it again...Currently I am having less migraines than ever thanks to botox and a beta blocker the latest line in a daily preventative.  Down to 10 migraines per 6 weeks vs what used to be almost daily.  Four ER trips in the last 2 years. ..When I came clean to my sponsor I was told no narcotics period. My deep cleaning (scaling) is coming up and despite the commitment to keep the bottle of pills out of my hands I was told no.  Prior to being given pain meds it was the single worst guaranteed trigger for migraines that would not stop (ie ER time)...My sponsor is a holistic med fanatic.  He won't take a pill for ANYTHING.  My partner expressed concern about my scaling appt. and I agreed to cancel it.  For those familiar with advanced gum disease putting off preventative treatment isn't great. FWIW I take 600 mg ibuprofren and do salt water but when the Novocain wears off my dentist would say "you will need a few glasses of wine to get you through the night." Since I cannot drink they were fine giving me pain medication...I have had a migraine 24 hours now (I think this one is stress related). I am not taking anything other than ibuprofen and maxalt (a non narcotic safe triptan med but I took the max in 24 hours).  Going to the dentist for a scaling is a huge migraine trigger (jaw pain/neck pain)...My sponsor's solution is to find holistic relief for my migraines and says don't take ANYTHING narcotic (even if it's in the care of someone else to monitor).  ..I don't believe much in holistic medicine but I don't want to insult him. But at the same time I am not going to blow off my sponsor and get medication that will ruin my sobriety date - again...Since I basically "relapsed" without actually drinking - in that I fully admit I took migraine medication inappropriately - I sort of deserve what is coming. I am going to meetings daily now. I am identifying as a newcomer despite not touching alcohol...But now this is happening and I don't know what to do...I have a sponsor that does not have gum disease OR migraines so they can say "oh I never have to take pain medication after a routine dentist visit" and "I know people who have very bad headaches and I think I have holistic options for you."..I also can't afford to miss work.  I feel pretty despondent. And for the first time really antagonistic about AA despite it being absolutely instrumental in me stopping drinking...TL;DR: I was sober from alcohol almost 15 years. I misused prescription pain meds. Now my sponsor says I can't take ANY pain meds for diagnosed conditions even if I have someone else hold the bottle.  I am now avoiding treatments because the pain would be unbearable.  Sponsor wants me to try holistic medicine. ..

Whoa whoa whoa. This is not cool AT ALL. Unless your sponsor is an MD AND your personal MD they have no business giving you medical advice at all. That is dangerous and unsafe. You should follow medical advice and get a sponsor who sticks to the steps and is not a wannabe life coach. That is wrong it is not in the Big Book not in any literature flat out wrong and dangerous. This is not AA this is one misguided person going rogue...My .02
&gt;My sponsor is a holistic med fanatic. He won't take a pill for ANYTHING...Good luck fighting cancer with corn roots or whatever wacky shit they use...I had a bad bad fall at the end of March.  Broke/bruised some ribs and my left lung collapsed.  I could only barely breath until they gave me IV pain medication.  Then once they got my lung reinflated and I left the hospital 4 days later I was on oxycontin and roxicodone for about 3 weeks after that.  I was upfront with my sponsor about it.  He said just make sure that I take the meds as prescribed and I won't have to worry about resetting my sobriety date.  I took meds as prescribed got out the other end without drinking...Your doctor isn't a physician and he's harshing my serenity right now.  I'd say get the script and find a new sponsor.  Yeah that's my tl;dr.
