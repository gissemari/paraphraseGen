Hello ..My path down the alcoholism road started in the summer of 2016. Prior to that I had been a social drinker. During the summer and into the fall I became very depressed suicidal and suffered from anxiety. My soon-to-be ex-wife was the source of my anxiety. She is an absolute tyrant and spent the majority of our marriage screaming at me and blaming me for all of our families problems. ..I started carrying her around with me in my mind she was screaming at me even when she wasn't there. Rum was the only thing that shut her up and made me happy. I became addicted and found no happiness without booze. I was drinking about 3/4 of a 750mL 5-6 days per week started drinking at noon and hiding bottles. ..Winter of 2016 I realized I had a problem and was somewhat successful in stopping. In April of 2017 I was still very depressed drank all day and was having suicidal thoughts. My STBX brought me to the ER and I got set up for a 28 day recovery program. I started the next day. ..I entered the program and enjoyed my time there. There is where I was introduced to SMART Recovery and alternatives other than AA. I did leave the program after 10 days as I had a work contract come up. I hadn't worked in months and we were facing eviction. I felt comfortable leaving the program with my new found knowledge and support. I also started therapy sessions and a CBT program from my depression and anxiety. ..I was sober and feeling better for seven months. My therapy sessions were doing me well and I continued work with SMART recovery. My ex-wife had always blamed all of our marital issues on my drinking. But now I was sober and she was still an asshole. ..I moved out in November and started drinking again. At the time I was forcing my self to drink. I didn't even like it and it wasn't helping my anxiety. I also returned to where we had previously lived and hung out with some old friends. From those friends I found out that STBX had an affair for the entire time we were living there. These men lived with her and my kids while I was away at work. ..I had my last drink on December 1st and returned home to face the divorce and fight for equal time with my daughter. Court did not go well for me and I currently see my child every other weekend. We have a GAL (Guardian Ad Litem) appointed to establish a placement schedule. The GAL ordered that I do an alcohol assessment. ..Currently I am quite happy with my life and who I am. I have a job my own home car have lost weight and do not feel depressed. My anxiety is completely gone. I feel better about my life than I have in years. My daughter is the only thing missing from my life. ..I have no interest in drinking and don't have urges. The last urge to drink I had was in Feb. and I just played the tape forward and used the skills I learned in SMART.  I continue to do CBT and therapy sessions. ..The assessor recommended I do a relapse program their program. It's four weeks three days a week. I'm a little disappointed but not surprised. It is more of a traditional AA type program. I'm only disappointed because what I am doing is working very well I am an atheist and I'm feeling shoe horned into a diagnosis and treatment plan. Her reasoning for recommending the program feels lazy. She said that last time I was sober for six months and relapsed so I'll probably relapse again because it's been six months. ..I'm sure the program will be fine I'll learn some stuff and it be helpful. I'll get a shiny certificate to the court so everybody's ass is covered and I'll get my official "addict in recovery" title to carry around with me like the Scarlett Letter. ..**My question for you'all is what are these people going to want from me?** I'm afraid that if I go in there and tell the truth that I feel great have no interest in drinking and am still doing things to maintain sobriety that they just wont believe me. I don't want to be labeled as "resistant" to the program. Addicts lie I'm an addict so I must be lying right!?!..I feel like I have no choice but to submit to the beliefs of AA carry around my alcoholic label admit that I am powerless and give myself to a higher power. This contradicts everything I have learned about myself in the treatment program and through SMART. ..**tl;dr:** Drank to alleviate untreated symptoms of depression and anxiety. Was addicted to alcohol. Treated my anxiety and depression haven't been addicted in over a year. Court is requiring me to a traditional relapse prevention program for custody evaluation. I'm afraid of coming off as cocky and resistant to the program because I feel great and have no urge to drink.

I say just go in hoping to pick up a few useful tools for your toolbag act positive because you do feel positive and things *are* working well and shine yo light! ..Because this is tangled up in legal stuff I think you're smart to be aware of coming off defensive of your chosen path so I think if you find a tone of openness it will be an unspoken demonstration of how far you've come--this is for your daughter so eyes on the prize and all that. You've got this and maybe you really will learn some good stuff. 
I understand your frustration. However having had experience with divorce custody and the courts compliance with this recommendation would be in your best interest. ..No one has to "submit to the beliefs of AA". I am an atheist and still found many things about AA beneficial. This has nothing to do with AA but I believe I have a chronic disease alcoholism. Today it is officially called "Alcohol Use Disorder." I understand and accept this and certainly don't feel labeled or a woman with a Scarlett Letter. I am proudly a recovering alcoholic. ..I wouldn't assume how you are going to be perceived by the court. If you can bring verification from your treatment program a doctor's letter etc. this may be wise. ..Is the program specifically for "relapse" or is it an Intensive Outpatient Program. I would insist on a program called Relapse Prevention or something similar. ..
Sigh. As a fellow SMART fan I hear you. I do not understand why you have been mandated to attend AA meetings when you already were using an approach that works for you. The notion that you relapsed while going to that support group so you need a different one is absurd. Relapse is common; it is not an indicator that one has failed. And certainly I've never heard of the reverse situation of someone being sent to SMART even though they prefer AA...A lot of progress has been made over the last 10 years or so and mandated 12 step attendance has become much less common. I wonder if you could push back on this a bit on the grounds that you already have a support group that you would like to continue to use and that best relapse prevention practices indicate that the best outcomes are achieved when people feel an ownership and affinity for their chosen support group rather than being forced into it.
My only advice would be to comply. You never know you might learn something if you are open minded. You do seem sort of cocky and arrogant and what you need to be is compliant. It might be a dog and pony show but it is their dog and pony show. If you can't do it for yourself do it for the opportunity to see you child. As I have learned it isn't always all about me.
