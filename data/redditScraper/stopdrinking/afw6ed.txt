I guess I have made it this far three times before in my 5 year struggle with alcohol.  I know for sure I've made it 8 months and 5 months previously (which I am including in the three count).  ..I am grateful each day for waking knowing immediately where I am and going to bed knowing who I am...IWNDWYT

I choose not to focus on failures.  Each of those times was a time when you were being healthy and not letting alcohol control you.  Imagine how much alcohol you *haven't* drank since you've started your journey?..&gt; I am grateful each day for waking knowing immediately where I am and going to bed knowing who I am...You and me both...
i hope you remember none of your time is erased by a relapse and something has been learned each time. IWNDWYT day by day. 
Well said! Congrats   
Keep on rolling   no hangovers. IWNDWYT or tomorrow
&gt;I am grateful each day for waking knowing immediately where I am and going to bed knowing who I am...THE BEST FEELING IN THE WORLD! IWNDWYT
