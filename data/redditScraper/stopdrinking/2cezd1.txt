(Ignore my badge - reset to Tuesday just gone)..Back on the sober train always struggle with weekends. To cut a long story short one of my good friends invited me over to his flatwarming last night. It's been on the cards for a few weeks and I knew it would be a crazily messy one (booze drugs etc etc). Thought to myself I would go say hi make face and vanish when I was ready with the intention of not drinking. Came to the realisation that I've tried that many many times before and have always ended up drinking/getting wasted/blacking out/spending loads of money/wasting my life blah blah. So I stayed in watched a movie with my GF went to bed for midnight read SD in bed (gives me a real inspirational boost - thanks guys and gals) and had a sober night. ..Up today feeling GREAT. Fridays and Saturdays and big triggers for me so 1 down 1 to go. I'm DJing at a local gig tonight and want to keep my head straight as it's a 2 hour set. Hope everyone is doing grand today!
