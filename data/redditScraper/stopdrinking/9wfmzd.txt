Hi everyone..This community I know is going to be a key ingredient in making this next year amazing. Today marks my first day of not drinking...My mom was an alcoholic but I never really drank until senior year of high school and even then it was infrequent. It picked up in college after breaking up with a boyfriend and throughout adulthood I've had periods of lots of partying no partying at all drinking fine in moderation overdoing it... just depended on the season. I've never felt reliant on it though I used to be much more shy and it did allow me to be more social...5 years ago I met my now husband (I'm 36). I wasn't going out too much and we met at a bar on my birthday weekend. I was successful professionally but didn't really have a vision of what I wanted to consciously create with my life. Within 6 months we were living together I was pregnant my now almost 4 year old son Eli and I was excited to be a mom. I had no problem abstaining from alcohol during pregnancy and I didn't get weight really until the end (I was slim going into it). ..During my pregnancy my husband struggled with his drinking to the point he got in legal trouble and we separated (no living together). I don't know how I survived it but I did. I couldn't believe I was recreating the one thing from my childhood I swore I would - life with a dysfunctional addict parent and divorce - but I now had a child to just be the best mom I could be. ..My husband struggled the next couple years and ended up getting sober for almost a full year. I didn't drink during this time to support him. I had no problem whatsoever. My husband is a great guy who also had issues from childhood he turned to alcohol to cope with. He got on medication got sober got back to work was there for his family. It was traumatic and hard for me but I always said if there was one relationship I needed to bring my  most Jesus  approach to it was this one. A child was involved and my end goal was two parents healthy in one home. I had numerous close friends step away from me because they didn't support the decision and I hold no ill will towards them - I get it. I also had friends who stood right by both of us. I mention this just to emphasize that rejection and loneliness to a once popular person surrounded with friends and social events - it was painful and isolating for me. But my husband and I have an amazing kid we get compliments on all the time we've miraculously worked through lingering resentment issues have good jobs rent a beautiful home good cars... we got to a really great place and my son has his dad in his life. I can deal with the rejection I've experienced - I can't guarantee my son would know how to cope growing up as his dad wasn't around. I firmly believe if I hadn't helped him his dad would be in dead or in prison for something stupid he did under the influence. ..Things were great leading up to Father's Day last year. Hubby and I work opposite shifts and I was in the gym at 4am to workout before work at 7. I used to be in terrific shape lots of HIIT and heavy lifting and 4am is tough but once I'm in the zone I'm disciplined and stick with it. I was reading daily devotionals getting involved in church lots of good stuff. ..On Father's Day my then 2 year old son and I came home after running errands to a young man addicted to meth robbing our home. He pulled a knife on us and threatened to kill us and put us in the bathroom. My son who was quite the chatter box just clung to me silent. My #1 goal since he was born was to try and raise as neorologicalky healthy son as I kid. Mental health issues are on both sides of our family. Hes a peaceful loving kid and I was not going to let this screw up my hard work. I told him how brave he was and I stayed incredibly calmn(meanwhile already dissociated to an extent). The guy left 20 mins later stole my car and eventually we got out and called police. He stole from others too and was sentenced to 28 years in June. Car had some damage but repaired and fine. My son doesn't remember a thing. And fortunately he had just switched from crib to toddler bed which was going well and this didn't impact that either (can be rough transition!). ..But... a few weeks after that event as I was picking up pieces back in the gym I got bit by a rapid fox. And two weeks after that the guy escaped custody for a day. Bam bam bam. I was over it...About 16 months later here I am good family 2 promotions but 40 pounds heavier trying to figure out who I am now. I don't drink regularly nor eat too much but it's much more regular than past and accounts for the weight gain. I go through periods of feeling fine to super irritable to disconnect to just general psychic unrest if there's such a thing. I recently realized medication would probably be a good thing. I've been in counseling off and on for years and already diagnosed with PTSD. I'm good at recognizing thoughts and shutting up negative ones but this beast is something I just can't control and I'm always grabbing for something to get relief...My psychiatrist appointment is in two weeks. Thanksgiving and bday are next week. I really want to spend these two weeks starting on sobriety as first step and go with a clear head to the appointment. Checking in here and connecting with you guys during moments of mental anguish will be key...Thanks for letting me share and for having me!!! :)..Also how do I set a badge? ....

I forgot to clarify - I'm not making the rabid fox and breaking out of custody thing up LOL. It was absolutely insane. ..Also I was studying for NASM personal trainer and ACE health coach certifications at the time. Had my own experience working out and losing weight from pregnancy. To put a positive spin on everything I choose to believe God walked me through this to get real life experience so I can help others in this position more empathically/intuitively. Time to study again and already getting back in the gym... just walking and stretching for now.
