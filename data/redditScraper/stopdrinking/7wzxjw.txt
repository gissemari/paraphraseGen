Every day we don't pick up is a miracle.  I strung together 772 miracles.  I never ever thought I was going to quit drinking.  I drank my whole life from the age of 12.  I met my husband at a bar.  Family gatherings are about drinking.  I told my therapist it would take a miracle for me to stop.  It's baffling to me still that it happened and it's happening everyday.  So those struggling take it one day at a time and know that this shit is hard and at the end of the day a miracle happened!

I like the stackable image. Now when I go to bed at night I can put the day up on the shelf with no regrets. The days aren't perfect and I can still be a jerk but it's not complicated by alcohol. Let's keep stacking!
What do you think has helped you the most on your journey?
