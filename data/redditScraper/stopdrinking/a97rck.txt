These last few months have really been a struggle.  Things aren't pleasant with my SO and holidays mean extra drinking back in my drinking days.  The thought of starting over on Jan 1 has crossed my mind more than once.  ..The other day I was at the store which also sells my favorite Bulliet Bourbon.  I was holding the bottle in my hand imagining that first drink.  I managed to convince myself not to carry it around the store in my cart.  I imagined feeling bad in the morning.  I also keep reminding myself that no matter how good it may be I "know" I can't drink forever.  If I'm going to quit Jan 1 what's the point in drinking now.  Jan 1 will come around and I'll have to live sober.  I might as well "white knuckle" it until then.   I felt like "I've got this"...&amp;#x200B;..However I still have Jim Beam at my home bar (others still drink).  The thought of just pouring one is strong.  I even started to run through the math of do I have enough mixers.  I have 1.75ml of Jim Beam and a 750ml of Seagrams Seven.  So I know I have enough booze for a few days.  I did the "I should wait until I walk the dogs to start" because I know once I start it will be a flood.  At this point I realize "I don't have this down".  ..&amp;#x200B;..I am at risk of taking a drink anytime.  I'm not sure if I'll ever have it down...&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;

I WILL NOT DRINK WITH YOU TODAY...&amp;#x200B;..It will be hard. Listen in life you cannot fully escape all temptation. Temptation will ALWAYS be around us. However we need to guard ourselves with an impenetrable armor of sobriety and control. DO NOT BE A SLAVE TO THE BOTTLE. Do not let that poison control you. Reach deep within yourself and find the strength to move forward. ..&amp;#x200B;..Is temporary happiness that causes PERMANENT DAMAGE worth it?..&amp;#x200B;..Stay strong friend.
Stay strong! If I drink then everything gets worse then I have to fight even harder.  Sending positive thoughts your way! IWNDWYT 
We all know the feeling of that first drink. It's amazing. ..What helps me is to remember that the feeling isn't the alcohol providing euphoria it's the feeling of an addict finally getting their fix.
