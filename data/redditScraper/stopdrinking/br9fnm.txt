I guess progress isn't always linear but I feel like I've made a small step tonight. After 4 days sober I got some bad news and I slipped up. Then 7 days of drinking followed. I had 2 drinks tonight and I just felt awful. I felt like I was just wilfully shitting on all the things I want my life to be. So I rang a government hotline (I'm in Australia) not expecting much. 30 minutes later I'd had a good cry I now had some resources to follow up on tomorrow and I felt a huge overwhelming sense of relief that I'd finally admitted my problems to someone verbally. .I hope I can turn this into a longer sober period. Thanks to all who messaged me and commented last time it really helped. My resolve is strengthening I can feel it. To all those struggling please feel free to share let's support each other. IWNDWYT.
