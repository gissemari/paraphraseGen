I've tried to stop drinking a few times before and one major block I've encountered is a fear of  coming out  as an alcoholic/problem drinker. There is no doubt in my mind that I have a problem with drinking and it's always much worse when I'm alone (drinking a bottle of wine to myself on a Monday night is a pretty common thing for me). No one knows I do this...The thing is I can drink pretty  normally  in front of other people so it never really looks like I have a problem. The one person I did open up to about it didn't really take it seriously and I have been soo guarded and hesitant to tell anyone else that I have a problem. I'm dating someone new now and while I'm sure he would be supportive (as would friends/family - some of whom have had their own struggles with addiction) I'm ashamed. I'm ashamed of my drinking and how bad it's gotten. I've been hiding it for so long that I don't know how to be honest about it. But I know it would be easier to confront the problem if I had support of people in my life. ..My brother is alcoholic sober for six years relapsed recently and has now been sober for several months. I don't view it as a moral failing on his part at all. I don't look down on him because of it. I wish I could take that same view of myself.

Mostly responding to the last paragraph about how you don't look down on your brother at all for his issues... in my experience I'm always hardest on myself. Other people are nowhere near as judgmental or harsh to me as I am to myself. Not sure where I'm going with this... I guess just that I've learned that other people probably see me as a better person than I do myself.
The good news for me when I was in your situation a few years ago is that most people didn't care if I was drinking or not. My tendency when I worry about stuff is to go way overboard. I don't find out just how overboard until the thing I feared actually happens. Almost without fail the thing is much smaller than the worrying about it was...Instead of thinking of myself as a failure a fuck-up and a monster I had to learn to see myself as a sick person. You wouldn't beat up on another sick person would you? That's how I began to learn to treat myself with love and kindness unconditionally no matter what. I had to become my own loving parent...Here are lists of top-voted stopdrinking posts on various topics and the last link is for immediate relapse prevention: ..[consequences](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=consequences&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[alcoholic](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=alcoholic&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[relapse](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=relapse&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[moderation](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=moderation&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[humility](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=humility&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[atheist](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=atheist&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[decision](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=decision&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[attitude](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=attitude&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[prison](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=prison&amp;restrict_sr=on)..More Help: [Steps_1_2_3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/477gm4/demystifying_the_steps_simply_a_set_of_tools_part/) --.[12 Steps No Religion](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3wdrft/after_some_editing_in_the_dino_den_an_agnostic/) --.Having an urge to relapse?

For me the most important thing is staying sober day by day . The people I know all have different drinking habits  (Normal or bad ). I can't judge them anymore than they can judge me . I'm not going to worry about anyone's opinion right now my life is too fragile and I'm working to be a better healthier person . I think your doing great ! And I won't drink with you today 
No one cares...You also don't need to come out as a problem drinker you can just say  I feel better when I don't drink so I'll pass thanks.'
Personally I've been going to AA for in real life support but have not told anyone except my wife and one trusted friend.  Some day if I really work the steps I will tell more people.  For now this is working for me - I have real friends and support from AA but other than perhaps observing me not drinking other friends family and co-workers don't need to know anything.
I don't have much advice but just wanted to say I really relate to this. I had 11 months sober earlier this year when I started seeing a new guy and partially out of fear of appearing like I had a "problem" if I said I was sober chose to start drink moderately in front of him (of course there was also other rationalizing of wanting drink going on here but the "coming out" part was key). Not only did this eventually devolve into me overdrinking again privately or with other friends but the relationship (if it had worked out long term) would have been doomed from the beginning because I started out essentially living a lie. Sobriety isn't going to work out if I am ashamed of it...Anyway thanks so much for sharing! IWNDWYT
