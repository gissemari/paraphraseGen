hello I am currently on day 5 of sobriety after my third relapse in the last nine years. I know it does not sound like much but since I first relapsed in February I have endlessly begged myself to quit but I could not find the strength to go more than two days sober (anywhere from 18-30 beers a night). It got to the point where I started driving drunk and well I got pulled over and arrested a few weeks ago...Interestingly enough no matter how much guilt and shame I felt (I have not felt that low since I was stealing money for booze over a decade ago) from getting arrested it wasn't even enough to make me quit...Well I can feel it now. I can finally feel that I am back to reality. I smiled ear to ear earlier because I knew I was finally free to begin sobriety again.....I must admit too that I have read nearly every post here the last couple weeks and it has slowly given me the courage to start over.....and now that I am beginning to feel like myself again it's pretty fascinating how much I forgot how I used to feel sober how I used to laugh and make eye contact and willingly carry on conversations rather than avoid them

Welcome back!  IWNDWYT 
Glad you're back. 
It's like being under some kind of spell isn't it being lost to booze.  I hope you hang in there with us and avoid that first drink because no matter what justifications we seem to come up with it's just not worth going back in there.  Welcome back!!!.IWNDWYT
