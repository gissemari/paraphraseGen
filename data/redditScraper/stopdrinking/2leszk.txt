~~I am special.~~  .I am flawed.  ..And that doesn't make me unique.  .It doesn't even make me interesting...Cognitive Distortions reside happily in the land of **Drunken Denial** my prior residence a funhouse of mirrors that lead to a madhouse of chaos.  I had a big WELCOME mat inviting all to visit and stay for a while forever if they dare then I would have someone to blame for choices I made other than that pale blonde with darkening eyes glaring back from the mirrors...A cunning temptress I became alcohol taught me to whisper false promises through my ruby red lips entice others to join me in my destructive behaviors.  At the time I referred to myself as a connoisseur a well-educated cynic that could and would drink with the boys.  Single Malt Neat.  No cigarettes for me I have my face to keep.  I drink the good stuff and when inebriated I could verbally run circles around most souls that dare enter the ring.  ..No problem here who needs to remember their evenings or the details of winning those debates?  ..**Certainly not a self-destructive alcoholic hell bent on catharsis through drunken intellectual warfare.**..At no point did I stop to consider who I was battling and why I would ever want to boast about keeping up with the boys' alcohol intake.   My husband at that time considered it a source of pride his wife was a dynamo a wordsmith with razor sharp tongue and had curves like a pin-up.   I was a trophy wife with intellect and the emotional strength of a fighter pilot.  ..~~I was special.~~  .I was delusional...I accepted my role only questioning it when the morning came too early and lacked understanding for my behavior.  The mornings became less and less agreeable and the nights started turning cantankerous.  ..I realized that I was apologizing in abundances when I could actually remember my nights.  I knew that the way I was drinking wasn't the crusade it once had been the fountain of youth and river of happiness were fables I used to comfort myself.   ..I determined with my excellent deductive reasoning skills that the problem was my husband the situation made me do it.  My responsibility ended because he didn't make me stop rather he indulged right alongside me...Fast forward to many failed attempts to find the **Mirage of Moderation.**  ..Tried tried kind of tried thought about trying talked about trying contemplated how someone so unique and special should need to try ...In other words I never really tried because I never thought I really needed to because I'm special I just had a situational problem...Changed the situation marriage ended which of course led to my strong embrace of my BFF the bottle I naively assumed my drinking would become more moderate after all the situation was the problem...Due to my overwhelming belief that I was special I decided to truly challenge myself I managed to get divorced from husband #1 and then married to husband #2 all in the same calendar year with the surprising end result of my drinking increasing.  ..Situations and people had changed; my newly beloved is a  normal  drinker at the very most.  Alcohol rarely touches his lips and he has never embraced my drinking as healthy or fun rather it caused turmoil and friction. ..But I am special and my problem is now that I live with a marijuana smoker I don't have a drinking problem I just no longer have a drinking partner.      ..**Drunken Denial isn't a zip code you just relocate from.**  No it takes an extraction of magnanimous proportions and reality had yet to befriend me...On the morning of my last binge I woke with little regret I couldn't remember anything thanks to my keen decision to just blackout drink to prevent the morning FACEPALM routine.  But it was different.  No one said one word to me about how out of control I was in fact my husband has given-up fighting with me and now finds some humor in my outrageous behavior it's a survival tactic.  ..And to be honest **I'm pretty fun when drunk until I'm not.**...**And in the silence I heard it all.**  They had given up.  They had accepted with defeat the person that I was and were attempting to minimize the fallout by loving me and sitting without judgment but in fear...In my hung-over guilt ridden state I made a lot of those same promises uttered those same lies and still believed I was special.  ..But I started doing something I hadn't done before I started taking action.  Baby steps really.  ..Reading this forum is where it began.  ..**I realized that my stubborn pride was worthless.**  ..I used the term  alcoholic  in reference to myself that was disturbingly difficult..I said it to my husband.  ..My parents...My closest friends. ..I said it to myself over and over and over and over and over again.  ..I even thought for a moment that I should put it on social media and tell everyone and immediately start apologizing luckily I didn't because how presumption of me to assume everyone would care...(I was still feeling special)....I have been running full force into life since I could walk.  I have a scar on my forehead from slamming into a wall at the age of 2.  ..I decided to do things a bit differently.  ..I slowed the fuck down. ..I went to AA despite my Ego.  ..I listened in AA despite my Ego...And a man shared a story about the early stages of his recovery and his struggle with his situation because his roommate was still an active drunk and how that would impair his recovery.  What he learned is that just because he chose to get sober doesn't mean anyone else has to do the same even if they live with you because this is an individual choice and quite frankly none of us are so special that the world revolves around us.  ...**We're not that special.**  ..I wasn't special when I was a drunk...I'm not special now...I can't expect everyone to care clap and rearrange their life to fit my needs.  ..I can't blame my addiction on my situational variables.  I am an adult...**I am not special.** ..**I am flawed.**..And a loquacious meanderer.  Thank you for your patience..

Hey so I know this post was a while ago but I just read it and it really helped me. I identify with everything you said. I was delusional too. 
Beautifully written.  You may not be "special" but you are a gifted writer!  Thanks for this.
There's some good stuff here. Thanks for sharing!
We all have flaws but that's what makes us all special. We all make mistakes but not everyone learns from them...You have. We do need to accept responsibility for our actions...You have. But are we all wholly culpable when we live in a society where drinking alcohol is the most positively endorsed legal and readily available drug in the world? I wish you well on your journey here's to new beginnings stay strong and sober :-)
This is incredibly powerful and matches my thought process when I got sober.  Good for you.  
That was wonderfully written.  I absolutely must suggest you watch this great movie called Smashed because your post reminded me of the main character in that movie.  It is about recovery and I think you'll enjoy it.
Extracted from denial = nail on the head.
