Was doing really great for about 4 months then went on vacation and it all fell apart in late May been struggling since. Could not bring myself to reset my badge until today. ..&amp;#x200B;..Finally have had enough this summer has been the most challenging by far. I know the only way to meet any of these challenges is with a sober and clear mind. I have been chatting with a online therapist and it has helped on my way to the book store to pick up "Naked Mind" by Annie Grace. ..&amp;#x200B;..IWNDWYT.
