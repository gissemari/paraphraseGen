Today marks exactly 21 days since I have stopped drinking. I wont go in to great detail but suffice it to say I had hit rock bottom. In and out of the ER multiple times in a week for throwing up blood and passing out all over the streets most of which I have no recollection of. I lost one of my bicycles (as a former bike messenger this hurt not for the monetary value but for the fact that I could get so fucked up I would lose such a prized and beloved possession) my phone my housing my job and as far as bridges being burned? I nuked them from fucking orbit. I even stole money from family. Fuck. Its been really lonely dealing with the aftermath because no one wants anything to do with my anymore which I can understand. It was a horrible year of the spiral downwards but here I am. Reading these posts and seeing that I'm not alone in this struggle has helped and also helped mitigate the feeling of loneliness. I just wanted to say thanks so much for unknowingly helping me get a start on this road. My body feels so much better I can sleep and I forgot how fucking good eating food is. I don't know if this'll last forever but I didn't drink today and tomorrow looks pretty promising too..

Good work! 
Great job on 3 weeks! It can be hard dealing with the aftermath sometimes but I've found that getting myself better is a great start in fixing what I can. I'll not drink with you today.
I will not drink with you today.
Congrats on three weeks. I will not drink with you tonight
