This will sound much less eloquent than it did it my head but anyway....It's interesting that in most cases when we are told or decide to cut something negative out of our lives (may it be french fries or coffee smoking or whatever) we find it ok and even recommended that we wean ourselves bit by bit.  But in the case of alcohol we are expected to just STOP because it is so detrimental.  We are just supposed to quit using something that physiologically has control over us. And then we beat ourselves up when we slip or relapse.  Let's give ourselves a little more credit.  This is one of the most difficult things most of us will ever do so take it a day at a time...an hour at time  and have a great weekend!
