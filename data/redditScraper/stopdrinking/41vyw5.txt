Few months ago I was thinking that making that daily decision not to drink today was just too much. I haven't got a problem *that* big right? ..Well 13 days ago it was my 24th birthday. I drank 15 beers in 10 hours all by myself. I passed out at maybe 4 am woke up at 10 am threw up all day long. Some point I couldn't puke anything but was still feeling so nauseous. I couldn't hold in water or food until 9 pm that day. Maybe 2 days after that I started feeling ok again. ..After that incident I knew I had to make that daily commitment. .It turns out I actually love making it! It just feels so damn good to be accountable I guess. It doesn't feel akward at all and doesn't hurt my ego at all.. ..13 days sober again but this time it feels *so good*. I'm so grateful for this sub and all the great people who support one another. 13 days ago I didn't want to reset my badge I didn't want to tell a soul I relapsed but I was honest here and got supported and I have tried to do just that. I know how hard it can get when all you want to do is just have a pint (or 10). Writing a few words of encouragement to someone wanting to drink is the least I can do. ..Thank you guys.
