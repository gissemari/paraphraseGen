I relapsed last week and finally had a week sober so tonight I decided to go to my local Celebrate Recovery. When it came time for the chips they were out of the ones for starting new. I know the chips don't really mean anything but if a program that supposedly cares about addicts can't even be able to provide for them why should I be there? It was just something I wanted to show myself that I'm actually trying and wanting to get better. I know I'm whining I just needed to vent.

Sounds like you were looking for an excuse to leave. Try again tomorrow. 
Glad you made it to the meeting. That's a big step (no pun intended). I find the Reddit counter works as my chip.
