Badge reset incoming. Today I will not drink. I thought if I could make it until hockey playoffs were over I could have a beer... well my team was out in the first round and I've been making an ass of myself ever since. I can't believe how depressed I have been since I relapsed - like it's pretty serious and scary. Plus where did all that money go? I don't understand what happened and why I can't drink like everyone else but maybe that's just something I need to accept and get on with life. Damn this thing is tricky..

Watching some hockey tonight... lets go blues!!! 43 days is a great accomplishment. I'm glad your back. I can't drink in moderation and I will not drink you!! 
Yep I had a relapse not too long ago. But at least you are being honest with yourself and you made it to 43 and you know how great sobriety can be. Welcome back!
&gt;maybe that's just something I need to accept and get on with life. ..I think you are figuring it out now
No one can drink like "everyone else." Some people never drink and some raging alcoholics drink handles daily. There is no everyone else to drink like. There is just your body to choose to ruin or not. ..I also found that the reasons I drank uncontrollably did not matter at first. Barely even in the first few months of abstinence did they matter. What mattered was quitting for real. Now I have the leisure time to ask why since I've cleaned up some of the mess...Hang in there! Lesson learned about watching sports maybe. Feel better soon and 43 days is an accomplishment so I hope you are able to take advantage of all that healing time and bounce back. The crappy mood from drinking can pass.
