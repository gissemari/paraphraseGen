In the past month I have tried to stop drinking. At first I struggled greatly. I then went two weeks without a sip of alcohol. This past weekend however I gave into temptation and had a case of beer. I need some advice on how to get through the temptation. .I also think a large problem is the current group of friends I hang around with. They are not supportive at all however I struggle finding new friends. What should I do?..Thanks

Are they friends or mutual enablers?      .If not supportive I suspect they are not real friends.       ..My path involved AA and now years later I have a circle of good friends who do not drink the Labor Day BBQ had no temptation as there was no booze.   Period.  For me it is that simple...There are other self help groups results may vary.  The two weeks shows you can do it...
That's a tough call regarding friends.  I'm struggling myself with relationships regarding friends and my girlfriend now that I'm sober.  Maybe you can explain to your friends what you are doing and hopefully they will support you.  That's what I did and my friends (who all drink) have been surprisingly supportive.  The other night someone offered to buy me a beer and a buddy stepped in before I could say anything and said "He doesn't drink."  That kind of support from friends really helps.
