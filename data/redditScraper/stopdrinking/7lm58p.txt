I've been waiting on hitting the six month mark. Never been sober this long in my adult life. ..I'd like to report that everything is going great. But there's still an abundance of problems caused by my last run in with alcohol...I attend AA meetings as part of my effort to stay sober. A guy I know in recovery asked if I'd be willing to share my story at an outpatient program. I agreed. ..This morning rolled around and admittedly I did not want to go. I thought of the excuses I could make to skip out on it. However as they say  nothing changes if nothing changes.  I kept the commitment. ..I showed up and told my story. Many elements of which I haven't shared on a public level. When I was done several people came up to me and talked about how they related to a lot of my struggles. These were things I thought only I struggled with. I left the meeting hall with a bit of relief. It felt like some light illuminated some very dark areas of my life. ..I don't have all of the answers. But I do know that when I am talking to other people who struggle with alcohol and are trying to be sober it helps me get through the day. Each of those days takes me farther away from madness that is alcoholism. ..I wish you all a safe and sober holiday. ..Cheers.

Thank you for sharing this. I have similar feelings of anxiety before meetings (not AA and we all speak at each of them).  But each and every time I feel so good when seeing people nod when I speak and I've always gotten some insights when others speak. .Congratulations on your six months and one day!  I will not drink with you today. 
I wish I could have heard your story.  It made me feel good to read your post and I could feel how you were being of service by sharing with others.  Good job on six months!  I will not drink with you today....and tomorrow!
Congratulations!!!
