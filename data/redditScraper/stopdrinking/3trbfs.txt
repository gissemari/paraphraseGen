Things are better. The hangover/withdrawal is finally bettrr. I've been going to as many AA meetings as possible. It's going to be a long road I'm sure. But I'm so determined to carry on...I used to be a daily drinker then sobered up in 2013. Since then I've had many relapses. They usually lasted a week always involving hard liquor. I did a lot of bad things during those week-long binges. Then I'd sober up vow to never do it again and then hate myself with a burning passion until I did it again. I was sorry for the things I did but mostly focused on how messed up I was. ..I'm trying to focus on the people in my life this time not the self loathing that drove me to drink again and again. I'm trying to be less selfish because I recognize that my drinking was selfish. I cared about my own pain so much more than the pain I was inflicting on others. That needs to stop. ..Did anyone else become a wildly pathological liar while they drank? I spun some insanely tall tales. Tales that may come back to bite me. But I'm not going to feel sorry for myself when they do. I was a million sheets to the wind I lied I'll take what's coming to me and vow to do better. ..It feels different this time. I don't want to feel sorry for myself. I want to get better make amends and never live dishonestly again. Drinking was the biggest lie in my life. A lie that it's be different this time that i wasn't really a drunk anymore that I deserved to cut lose. Nothing good ever came of my drinking. And I'll keep going to AA and potentially treatment.
