And hate myself 
----------immediate responses--------

Been there more times than I care to admit. Don't hate yourself. Today is a new day! 
That's what we do and why we are here. I am right there with you. I Will not drink with you today.
Been there way too many times today is a new day.  ..&amp;#x200B;..alcohol is cunning.  baffling.  powerful.  ..&amp;#x200B;..However I will NOT drink with you today...&amp;#x200B;..Good Luck.
I can't tell you how many times I have relapsed..The self loathing depression BUT I always start over and I know that is the most important thing!
We've all been there. Don't be so hard on yourself. You will get through this! Stay strong IWNDWYT 
Today can mark the beginning of a Virtuous Upward Spiral!..Got a plan?
It's amazing how quickly people forget and move past old mistakes once you start putting one sober day in front of another. Just worry about today. Hang in there. I don't know if anything worse than the crushing lows of a Day 1.
