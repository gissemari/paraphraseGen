Slowly drank 1 crown and coke at dinner with my military friends at this school I'm attending. Had no plans on continuing further not an hour after dinner completely shit faced woke up barely remember last night enjoying the feeling of embarrassment and restarting day 1. Fuck I need to be in control of my life

"No plans" = No hope. That's what it would have been like for me too.
To think 2 years ago I was proud of the fact that I could keep up with the soldiers while the other wives were passed out or were makingout with each other from being too intoxicated. Meanwhile I was over there wearing my "high tolerance" like a badge of honor and judging them for acting like idiot when they were drunk. Flash forward to last year drinking all day everyday alone on the couch never leaving unless it was a trip to the liquor store. Blehhhhh ..Welcome back! Glad you dusted off and jumped back on the wagon we saved your seat :)...[High Five](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg)
