I'm 26 years old and I struggle a lot with what can be described as a combination of brain fog and social anxiety. (I guess the anxiety causes the fog maybe)...I don't drink everyday at all. Actually just on the weekends. I do however drink a lot almost every Friday and I am starting to notice a pattern in the way that I feel the Monday after at work (bad)...The thing I'm noticing is that on Mondays I will have this extreme nervousness and inability to think clearly. This continues into Tuesday and Wednesday but then on Thursday I start to feel good again then coming Friday I'm feeling pretty darn good and then of course I go out and drink again...What I'm asking is if you noticed a pattern yourself where the effects of a night out drinking can linger on for so many days when you're only drinking 1-2 days a week?

Yup. Former weekend warrior here. It happens. The inly way to stop it to actually recieve professional help or drink waaay less than what you would and it'll stop before its late. But thats me. Everyone is different
I would say of you're on a stop drinking thread. Its time to stop
This is how it works...The "aftermath" of putting poison in my system is that my system has to clear out the toxins and reset.......   takes time.   ..Repeated cycles of it worsen the effects.....
That describes me and how I was.  Weekend binger who paid with "anxiety hangovers" for days afterward.  The anxiety felt worse than any physical sickness and resulted in many sick calls to work or missed classes.  It's nice to be sober and not wake up feeling anxious and foggy.
completely describes me. A day or two heavy drinking then a few days of anxiety hangover. That's what finally got me to stop. I just couldn't take that feeling anymore
