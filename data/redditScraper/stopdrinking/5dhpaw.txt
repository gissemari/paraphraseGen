I just went looking back through all my posts. I've never started a new account always this one. It breaks my heart to see the desperation and hurt followed by such joy and optimism only to again be followed by more despair. I wish that I would've had the foresight to do that before the relapses. However I can see that the periods of sobriety were getting longer and the relapses shorter so I guess that's good right? This time I decided to stop fucking around and get the help that I truly need and this time I got honest. I didn't hide some of the ugly just for me. I let it out. I showed my mom just how bad it was and I asked her for the last time to help me. (I know it is the last time because she told me so) I also went to professionals and enrolled in an intense outpatient program. I told my boyfriend under no uncertain terms that I will leave him if it means protecting my sobriety and I mean it. I will leave all my friends and family that I love if it means that my boy will not know an alcoholic mother. My first group session is in an hour and I know I am going to ugly cry and that's ok. I've cried so much this last week I thought I might just dry up and turn to dust but I know their is more pain in me if I let this disease control my life. There are always more tears even if I were to die from this those tears would just fall from different eyes. My life is still in shambles. My credit cards are almost maxed. Our bills are piling up and christmas is just around the corner. I am so behind in school that I fear I will fail this semester and fuck up my SAP. Although I was honest with my instructors and to my surprise they are all very supportive in helping me finish strong. Still the work has to get done and my mind is just a big fucking shit storm so I can't focus very well. As you can tell by my rambling..I don't know what I am trying to say this time other than I hope to god this one sticks. I feel confident but I have felt that way before and I have said this all before. The only thing different this time is I am not bullshitting myself about needing more than just support of friends and family and AA. I need real intense therapy and I am going to get it.

That sounds like a huge difference. Friends and family aren't always the best support. 
Sounds honest and thorough you can do this. Putting in the effort is half the work. I've turned my life around on the brink of defeat you can do the same!!
