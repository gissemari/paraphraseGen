Last week I was diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis so I need to stop drinking right away. I've quit before so I thought I'd be okay but I guess the addiction has got a much stronger hold on me now. I made it four days before relapsing last night...I spoke to my boss today who is one of the best people I've ever known and she is fully supportive of me taking time off work to go to rehab if necessary. I'm just wondering if anyone here has had experience they'd be willing to share?

Rehab was the best decision I made in my adult life. I went for 35 days/nights. I followed their direction did the homework went to all the groups and listened to my treatment team. I put my absolute trust in them and worked hard. I have not relapsed since then.
I've never been to rehab but I'm impressed by the sober days these two have. Why not try it?
If needed I would go back to my rehab in a heartbeat. They helped me in so many ways besides withdraw coping skills understanding my disease about myself ground techniques etc. They got me on a schedule got me to eat again made sure I was taken care of on a medical level (BP liver medication for anxiety etc). Made some decent friends there too but that is besides the point. They helped me find myself again and gave me tools to use when I got out and a plan.
