It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-----------------------------------------..**Struggle:** Two friends (a married couple) commissioned a landscape collage from me but then when I had finished the collage they chose not to buy it. WOW does rejection hurt whether it is romantic or artistic...**Triumph:** Despite this setback I am still putting several of my collages into an art show this week...Someone on this site (forgive me for not knowing who) recently said  We are responsible for the effort not the outcome.  I think that this person was talking about making amends but I am slowly getting better about trying to remember this in all aspects of my life. I worked hard to make the best pieces I could for this show and I am swallowing my fear of failure and entering them. The outcome whether they sell or not is completely out of my control...**General:**  The meaning of life is to find your gift. The purpose of life is to give it away.    Pablo Picasso.
----------immediate responses--------

Sorry to hear about the reneged commissioned piece SFMary! Not cool! I hope someone buys it for even more than they commissioned it for...My triumph is a day and night completely unobserved where I could easily have bought drank and disposed of any evidence of alcohol   no one would ever know unless of course I did something dumb. Which I probably would.  But anyway I ate dinner watched some tv and now am headed to bed. Sober!
What's up? It actually is Wednesday! As a Kiwi I'm so used to seeing Reddit a day behind us...This is my first week here and I'm on day 3. This weekend is going to be hard as my wife is going away with our son for a night and ordinarily that would have been carte blanch to have at it. But I'm thinking positive and planning some things to do that night to keep me busy
Struggle: Procrastination and just avoidant behaviours in general! It bugs me how much I talk about the things I'm going to do but then don't do...Triumph: I got an email today saying that my application for this job I applied for has made it to the next stage of the selection process. I now need to try to prepare for a phone interview....General: I just need to find the right balance of how hard I need push myself to get out of my rut.
**Struggle:**  Money is beyond tight.  The house is a mess.  I'm not happy about being married and co-habitating.  I'm working on making real changes at these things but it's not a quick fix.  I'm about 1/3 of the way through the plan of achieving independence .and it's very hard to be patient when I feel so miserable...**Triumph:** 8 weeks cigarette/vape free.  98 weeks alcohol free. I'm getting used to working full time I don't mind it except for the fact that I don't have as much time with my kids and I can't keep up with the housework.  Feeling good at the new job though.  ..**General:** It's blueberry season.
Struggle: I'm learning that lack of sleep is a major trigger for me. Tonight I had a really hard time with the idea of doing the bedtime routine with my (very challenging right now) 3.5 year old without a glass of wine - Just ONE (eye roll). I've slept terribly all week and it's catching up to me. ..Triumph: Didn't drink today. ..General: Just binge watched The 100 and Grace &amp; Frankie... highly recommend both!

S.  Daughters Mom got her a dog.  That's fine but daughter lives with me.  It's been a difficult battle this summer. ..T.  Camping with my daughter.   Listening to the frogs.   They are quite busy this evening. ..G.  It feels good to get out and get away from all the overwhelming chaos that is my life.
I'm so happy for you! I'm glad my words helped you :) you have inspired me. Keep up the great work. I'm so proud of you. 
Keep doing your best! You rock! 
Hey there! Well triumph is I am on to day three sober and my daily routine includes a long walk. On the down side my feet are in bits from the long walks. Good luck with your art show Mary. IWNDWYT:-)
Struggle is a lot of changes at work lately and my colleagues and team are doing a lot of venting. Trying to keep conversations positive but still a struggle. ..Triumph really none today apart from not drinking! For 25 days too. Proud. ..In general I had a fun chat with a friend of mine via messenger. We normally chat in a light hearted fashion but today somehow we ended up having a rather deep conversation about drinking my relationship to drinking and also his. It was nice to open up a bit but also just to be asked about it directly and have someone show interest. This is the first time this has happened since I've not been drinking. Learned I actually don't mind opening up a bit and talking about it is not as hard as I had thought. ..IWNDWYT ..
STRUGGLE: Walking around with a broken heart. My daughter is leaving for college in a couple of weeks and I am having great difficulty imaging life with her not in it. I love her so much and she is my world. ..TRIUMPH: Staying sober despite my broken heart. ..GENERAL: I have many things to be thankful for. 
Going to Ibiza today. Wish me luck. Struggling lately. I will not drink with you all today.
Today is my day 3. I know it's a  fairly minuscule achievement but this time it feels much different.  In the past 2 years I've been able to hold out until day 9. I wasn't white knuckling so much this time and my husband is still drinking quite heavily. I haven't slept well but I feel better than any of the other days waking up with a hangover although i do really hope I can get back to a regular sleep cycle soon. .I've lost a kilo in just 3 days and last night I did enjoy a nice bowl of ice cream which was really lovely on such a hot summers night. .I still have the sweats and itches but seem to be managing well. .I'm actually all laced up and ready for a run one where I won't be regurgitating anything too! .Thanks to all in this sub it's so much easier now having lurked and lingered for a bit. I love all the success stories as well as the stories of struggle. You all help to keep things in perspective for me. .HAPPY HUMP DAY ALL. 
That's so disheartening Mary. Shame on them for not adhering to their end of the deal. I'm sure it was a *beautiful* collage like you my SBFF :). I'm excited to hear all about the art show on Monday! ;) xo...**Struggle:**     It's been a really tough 2 weeks. First the oral surgery issues then sis went on vacay and I was stuck in the house with Mom for 7 days straight then SO went on vacay with kids...I felt so envious and wound up isolating. I realize now that was a childish way to act on my behalf. ..**Triumph:**     Totally reconnected with SO yesterday; cooked a delicious dinner and had a lovely evening. We're looking into a vacation for August - yay! :)..**General:**      There was someone here at SD that relapsed after having a year of sobriety. When the person posted from the hospital the outpouring of love kindness and support was absolutely amazing - it touched my heart. The person has since received medical attention and is doing better. It's things like this that make me so proud to be a part of this incredible family of sobernaughts. Thank you SD! &lt;3
Good morning! I'm in a weird and stressful place but IWNDWYT 
Hi Guys!..Aussie here checking in 3 days sober after a very troublesome 4 day bender. I woke up Monday morning with no memory of the last few nights. I struggled with work I had anxiety attacks and I haven't been able to eat properly. ..S: I'm fighting the health concerns from a simple 4 days of not caring for myself. My skin is bad my emotions are only somewhat stable and I've had headaches shakes and trouble sleeping...T: I nailed an interview today with an opportunity for me to move overseas to continue my career. It's a huge achievement and I was so sharp in the interview. I was - am - really proud of myself at that moment...G: In Sydney today the weather has been 22 degrees in the middle of winter. It's due to stay this way right until the weekend. Happy times ahead!
**Triumph:** I facilitate a weekly recovery meeting. About a month ago friends and regulars asked me to step up my game. It's going well so far. I've been deflecting some absolutistic thinking back to discussion and making space for newer folks to participate...**Struggle:** I have learned the hard way that you can't point out cognitive distortions to someone who isn't interested in correcting them. I'm trying to keep that lesson front and center as I talk with my wife. She's dealing with a frustrating and painful sports injury. It could be life-altering. It's scary as fuck painful and leaves her spiraling into negativising and all or nothing thinking...*General:** I need some escapist summer reading. Any recommendations?
- **Struggle**- I've been letting my juvenile insecure voice get a little louder these days. The  I'm not smart enough not likeable enough not skinny enough.  She's not loud enough to make me want to drink but I blame her for my old drinking days. I also blame her for making me a loner when I was a kid. I'm gonna name her Bertha because that lady was mean to me when I was a kid. Fuck Bertha. ..- **Triumph**- Despite Bertha I know I've been getting better with my hands at work. My job requires precise fine motor skills and I'm finally at the skill level I consider date I say... good:) I'm happy I've finally gotten to this point. ..-**General**- I'm excited this is my last year living in the Midwest. I've been here for 6 years and had a great time. It's nice to know I can be in a different state in just a few hours on the weekends. But by golly am I excited to go back to the Greatest State in the Eorld next year... that's right folks... Texas! (We Texas folks have a lot of pride for our state :)
Struggle: a little too much on my plate but getting it done...Triumph: still sober!..General: the royals won last night.
Struggle- work and finances are killing me. But you know what will make neither better? Alcohol. So for that reason I'm not drinking...Triumph- every second that goes by after day 15 is the longest I've gone without a drop of alcohol since college. And that's pretty cool. I am in such good shape. I've worked out 16 of the 17 sober days (one of which an intentional rest day and about 21 our of the last 26. I had an incredible body before i started boozing and blowing lines plan to get that back ASAP. You know what helps with that? Not drinking. ..General- this rain! I feel like I'm in Seattle sometimes. But I don't mind it it keeps me in the gym and away from rooftop bars and temptation...Not drinking today with all of you!
S: I'm very scared about my move to a different country. I will be alone for the first time in my life and I'm semi scared I will fail like I failed so many times here in America. What if I don't get the good job or get into schoom for a master's or mba? ..T: I stayed truly sober no weed and no alcohol for 23 whole days. I haven't done that since high school. That was over 15 years ago. ..I'm keeping up on my checklists and staying more organized keeping to my budget and not wasting money. ..G: van halen forever 
**Triumph:** After an excellent evening of dinner and dancing we talked it over. We're exclusive :)..**Struggle:** It's absurd how busy I am lately. I'm making money and getting by but I relish the times when I can just sit down and relax. No chores no errands no plans.  Just napping good food leisurely recreation and cat time!..**General:** I'm looking forward to seeing some high school friends this weekend. It's been a while since we've seen each other.
**Struggle:** There's *so - much - noise*!! So much noise. It's driving me crazy...**Triumph:**  I have written more during this summer than during the last two years. That's really something!..**General:** I bought some nice sunglasses today. Since I went all winter too stressed out to get winter shoes or jacket getting much needed sunglasses in late July isn't bad at all lol!
Ouch - rejection is always hard even IF you feel it's logical.  Emotions don't follow logic (well at least mine don't). I am impressed at your dedication to the art show - I hope it goes better than expected. ..**Struggle:** My anxiety is up this week due to work and general life issues...**Triumph**: I went bouldering last night and made it up a route that I've been working on but until last night was unsuccessful at...**General**: I am listening to Lincoln in the Bardo on audiobook.  Yesterday this quote caught my attention: "perhaps we were not so unlovable as we had come to believe."  I ruminated on that all day yesterday.  
Struggle:  My current position is up in the air I won't really know anything until around December.  The wife and I were going to start taking bids on projects and getting some stuff figured out but now all that is on hold and I'm in saving mode just in case.  ..Triumph:  I have not forgotten the face of my father and will do all I can to be a better man than him.  ..General:  "There is a gift given to you.  You are it you are the gift" 
S: I've been stressing really badly the last week. Triggered by actual things that truly are worrisome but then my mind takes them and runs. I've had thoughts of drinking. Not cravings or urges. Haven't had any close calls. Just passing thoughts. I want to nip those in the bud. ...T: I'm making excellent progress with a work project. It doesn't solve all the previously mentioned problems but at least I am being productive and I am looking forward. ...G: if I had a time machine I could fix a lot of shit just by going back a couple years. But I fucking know I would get there and say fuck it and drink again maybe worse than I did the first time around
Gosh /u/sfgirlmary - that is so not cool of your friends - I hope the art show proves much much more affirming. Super awesome that you have artworks completed that you are going to show!!!..Struggle: my Kiddo is in a headspace I am really finding hard to deal with really really hard to deal with. I think I may actually need to consult a professional about some of it because she's heading places that could get really really difficult in terms of how she engages with the world and understands her own self...Triumph: my house is clean and large parts of it are now tidy. Woot!..General: reading "think small" a bit tonight - and it talked about setting "bright lines" - simply rules that require no deep thought to process or engage with - as it works better than complex rules. One of the examples was making firm rules about drinking as opposed to trying to stay within the medical guidelines for safe amounts in a week. The firm rule - the "bright line" - takes no deep thought to work out how to obey the rule. But trying to monitor consumption and fit the guidelines requires all kinds of mental activity. Which explains why it is easier for me to stick with "I will not drink" instead of "I will only drink four standard drinks a week" or similar. The former is a "yes I will stick to the rule" or "no I won't" decision - very cut and dried.... and working so far despite the lurking lingering lizard-brain fuckits!...
Struggle: I'm in a really bad spot mentally. My depression is kicking my ass and it's making me not want to do ANYTHING. It's awful and I'd like to scoop my brain out. ..Triumph: Uh only the not drinking. ..General: I think my 11 year-old may need some mental health help too. She refuses to shower and hasn't changed her clothes in a week. Maybe this should go under struggle....
Struggle: Had to go on a wild goose chase this morning to pick up my parents meds. Pissed me the hell off and drained me before noon...Triumph: I got it done and my own meds have been making my life so much better...General: Bipolar with aspergers sucks but I got this shit. 
Struggle: at work I constantly feel like I'm losing friends. In the four years I have worked there seems to constantly be an overhaul with staff every 4-6 months. Just as you seem to create working relationships then poof it's gone and gotta start back from scratch. My struggle is that I often become a product of my environment. When things are going great I can't be phased. When things are not going as well my mood and emotions are affected and my work output suffers. ..Triumph: in the last 62 days as I have soujourned on my journey I have realized that I can either become a product of my environment or my environment can become a product of who I am. The decision to stop drinking was ultimately the catalyst for me making other positive choices in life. In the last 62 days my work ethic and my willingness to do things for the sole benefit of helping others has skyrocketed. I have seen the ripple effect my alcohol usage had and now I'm seeing the ripple effect my sobriety has. I'm realizing how my mood can affect and alter the environment around me. It feels damn good to contribute something positive and to longer feel overwhlemed and anxious when things aren't always going my way. .General~The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result...
Love your shares r/sfgirlmary. Rejection does hurt and bad sometimes. But the effort &gt; the outcome is a great truth to hold on to. (I think I did that right the maths are kind of hard for me lol)..**Struggle:** I am still so deeply saddened and angry and hurt by my breakup with my guy. I can't stop thinking about him wondering how he is if he's binging or drying out and getting sober (again). Since I finally cut the cord from him on all social media too I feel so in the dark and it's scary. But that's the idea of walking away from someone who's ended up being continually toxic to you right? They're gone from your life. So just... going through it I guess. ..**Triumph:** I signed with a talent manager last week and have embarked on a non-stop 6 month program to accelerate my acting career here. I now have actual *goals and to-do lists* (wut?!) and am very excited about my future as far as finally putting ALL my energy into what I am good at and what I love instead of staying small and hiding behind a bottle. ..**General:** It's just so messy right now. I feel so devastated and it catches me in the throat like a ton of bricks sometimes and I spontaneously combust into tears. But then Monday I had a great new headshot photo session with a beautiful warm man who gently drew me out and helped me show my rawest self in the lens. His prompt to me that he wanted me to feel while looking into the camera was: "This is me and I want you to *see it*" which was pretty powerful to me. I'm looking forward to seeing the proofs of that. So it's a mixed bag but I'm grateful to have here to come to to talk to folks who want the same thing as me. To LIVE. &lt;3 
Struggle: the last few weeks I've been a ball of anxiety and depression twisted and rolled together. It was fucking up my work life and my personal relationships something awful. Its been getting better since yesterday and I am actively seeking help now but jesus christ that was rough to make it through sober...Triumph: i hit six months yesterday and literally never thought i would make it this far. I'd always planned to die drunk alone in a darkened room somewhere possibly a cheap motel but after hitting six months I'm feeling a lot more positive about the future and dont think there is anything or anyone that can stop me from living a happy fulfilling life rich with good friends and good health. If i can kick my drinking problem I sure as shit can beat the fuck out of my depression...General: pokemon usum has been a lot of fun to play and in some ways its actually been one of the more challenging pokemon games I've played probably ever. I does have a noticeable lack of puzzles which I'm not too keen on but the kahuna battles have been way harder than any of the gym battles in recent memory.
Struggle: quitting drinking while being the best thing I could ever do head saved my life. But now that it's been a while my chronic bulimia monster is rearing its ugly head saying "Pick me to replace alcohol!" It's been extremely frustrating to deal with...Triumph: I just got my lifts going up at the gym finally! After being stalled in a plateau for the past six months here I am making gainz...(118 lb 5'2 female):  OHP 60 lb BP 90 lb squat 135 lb DL 160 lb. Feels good to improve on something.
Struggle: Keeping my expectations (of people places and events) in check. About to move and I need to just do what needs done and let the rest of the pieces fall where they may with the knowledge I can handle it. Easier said than done but i like to think my thought process is at least a start. ..Triumph: Taking care of myself and my home. First time in my life there isn't a giant pile of dishes in the sink and I took time to paint my nails!..General: Has anyone else heard the moon is going into an eclipse or retrograde or something and it is supposed to bring rebirth and new life? That's cool and all but I like the new life the past 4 months has given me lol
70 days! ..Struggle: all work related..Triumph: Just doing better on every level..General: preparing for my first sober Burning Man (9th in general) 
**Struggle:** I am finally giving up pot my crutch for alcohol...**Triumph:** I haven't smoked for over a week! (but not quite 2 weeks)..**General:** This is hard but not as hard as giving up alcohol. I can make it. I'm so lucky to have my support system in the real world and am getting active here to help as well.
Hi everyone! This is my first time posting (in this group and on reddit) and my 17th day sober. ..**Struggle**: Quitting alcohol has been easier than I anticipated but I'm struggling with doing something productive with my time and energy after work. So far I just waste my time on Instagram or watching shows on Netflix. I should study for the GMAT so I can get into UCLA but after a full day of work my brain is fried and the brainless activity feels good. Any suggestions on how to refocus after work are appreciated...**Triumph**: Despite of struggle with productivity I have successfully navigated engagement parties trivia nights and The Bachelorette viewing nights without wanting to partake in alcohol. So far I love waking up every day with a clear head and tons of energy. ..**General**: I'm excited to be here and be part of the community! Happy Hump Day you beautiful people!
Hey hey hey! 31 days and going strong. IWNDWYT. Thank you for this community. 
Keeping it cool today
**Struggle:** Being short staffed at work has led to me feeling overwhelmed and burned out. ..**Triumph:** I finally learned how to make a word appear bold on Reddit. ..**General:** Currently binge watching The Handmaid's Tale so I tell myself if I just get through the day I get that as my reward.
I looove your art Mary!  So sorry your friends were less than thoughtful about your agreement....**Struggle:**  My best friend is struggling big time with a husband who is majorly depressed and in chronic pain.  They're slowly going underwater living on just her income and it breaks my heart to see her try so hard to be brave in the face of this unrelenting difficulty. .He's doing all of the things going to therapy two different therapists on depression medication etc.  But the judge-y part of me thinks he is partially relying on her to save him and is taking advantage of her (part of his personality that I've seen when we were all younger).  I hate feeling so damn helpless!  Just sent her a gift certificate for a massage in her town for a little relief...**Triumph:**  Making gains at the gym.  Little steps but I always seem to hurt myself once I get to a certain level so I'll take the baby steps!  Finding myself more interested in my own life again and more cheerful.  Almost like a new pink cloud.  Interesting.....**General:**  Randomly just acquired tickets to see Shania Twain on Friday via GF's co-worker's now-dead neighbor.  Phew.  Feel like I might need to smudge the tickets when we get them.
Struggle - I'm not particularly jazzed by my work/professional life right now but trying to hang in there and simply be thankful that I have a good job! ..Triumph - I finally figured out how to remove the drain stopper from the bathtub and clear out a small-animal-sized clump of hair. Feels awesome to have a shower without a puddle around my feet! I remember when I used to drink heavily things like that would just annoy/anger me and I wouldn't bother to take action myself. Pretty silly. ..General - Reading a LOT these days. My Kindle is my new best friend!
S - Doing a remodel and being without a kitchen while trying to maintain a healthy diet is semi-impossible..T- I feel like my husband and I are actually getting closer during this time which I just figured we were gonna make each other crazy..G- I seriously love my silly dogs
struggle: You guys. I've gotten unhealthier in so many ways since getting sober. I'm working out less (not sure why.. no motivation/I've felt tired all the time) I'm eating more junk food and I've gained like 5 pounds. This kind of sucks but I'm giving myself some leeway until I really feel like I'm on top of the sobriety thing and then I'll focus on other aspects of health. I'm still really struggling from like 5-7pm every day. I'm just irritable then I want a drink badly and I feel like I'm taking it out on my poor husband. ..triumph: I've been so much more productive in the evenings lately. Getting a lot done so that's great...general: I'm spending my booze money on tea now. I accidentally ordered a pound of earl grey earlier this week not realizing what 16oz converted to. Looks like I'll be drinking a lot of earl grey this year!
Struggle: Day 5 and I just got discharged from a program where I really like the people. Feeling lonely.  ...Triumph: Despite that I finished a big program today and that program finally enabled me to reach out for help with my alcohol problem.   ...General: Um meh? Not sure today. 
Struggle - my girlfriend has brought up moving in together and I'm not sure I'm ready at all. It's brought up all sorts of thoughts (doubts) about how I feel about the relationship in general. My head's a bit all over the place with it. Blahh...Triumph - it may be the pink cloud forming but I'm feeling really good at 10 days. I've managed 50+ before and fallen off the wagon so I know there's plenty of challenges to come but it definitely feels like a bit of a mental shift has taken place. I feel like I want to be sober and to be the best guy I can be this time round rather than simply being sick of drinking and all the carnage...General - Getting back into the swing of things with running despite the heatwave. I honestly don't know where I'd be without this sport/ hobby/ lifelong affliction...Happy hump day all IWNDWYT(omorrow) since I've made it to bed already for today!
**Struggle:** My hubs still drinks.  A lot.  Things have gotten a lot more tense between us since I quit drinking.  It's getting worse as I rack up the days...**Triumph:** My biggest work challenge has become So Much Easier since stopping my nightly alcohol poisoning.  I have always been highly functional but who knew I could be *this* functional?!  I didn't know it was dulling my cognition that much.  ..**General:** I have discovered Halo Top ice cream.  A whole pint is around 300 calories.  Good god.  I'm over the moon.  
Struggle: I started today so that's enough of a struggle in itself. I called out of work hungover and canceled an appointment with my psychiatrist and realized this is it. I have to do something now. ..Triumph: I started today! And I'm approaching the time of evening I'd normally start to drink but instead I'm having diet Dr. Pepper in my favorite glass and feeling pretty good...General: I had a terrible roommate the worst person I've ever known who refused to let me in a week after I moved out to get a very sentimental item from my grandfather a shelf I stained with him before he passed. Today I called my old landlord and asked if she'd let me in to get it and she did! TAKE THAT MARIE. As petty as it is I wish I could be there when she sees the shelf her microwave was on isn't there anymore. :D 
Struggle: today was a rough day at work. As I told my husband while I was driving home I feel like my brain has too many programs open and even task manager is fucked up. I just need a hard reset or something. ..Triumph: I had a great interaction with a patient today. He was so grateful to have me spend time explaining everything to him and answering his question. ..General: It doesn't matter how slowly you go just as long as you keep going. ..:)
Struggle: I have been feeling really angry for the past few days for no good reason. ..Triumph: I am 2 weeks sober today. Eating a lot healthier too...General: I have the best dog in the world. He is always there for me when I feel alone or need a cuddle. 
Struggle:  I feel like my mind is being attacked constantly by the past - I haven't slept well and am working overtime in a HOT factory all week...Triumph:  I am getting better and better at combatting my issues with meditation and being mindful of my thoughts and recognizing them as just random firings in my brain and not a reflection of my true self or beliefs...General:  Sweetcorn is being sold road side everywhere here and am enjoying as much as I can while I can
That is a daunting and heavy piece. I have yet to read it all. You should try Tenth of December which is a collection of short stories. Much more accessible and really displays his uniqueness.
