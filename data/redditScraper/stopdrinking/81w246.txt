I'm having trouble staying sober for an extended period of time. Anybody have any tips when it comes to consumption Replacements such as food or drink? Or any overall tips to stay sober for longer. . Thanks

I just had to go to AA meetings whether I wanted to or not and I had to call people before I made the decision to drink.  ..Of course I had to lose more than I was willing to lose before I could quit for good. Maybe you aren't there yet. 
Figure out your triggers and avoid them. 
I'm going to give the most broken record advice here at SD but one day at a time and drink lacroix...I could never imagine quitting for 14 days before but I can abstain for 24 hours. So every morning I make the commitment to a sober day/night. Nothing more nothing less. ..As far as food and drink I found sugary beverages and food to be decent substitute but that's a lot of junk calories. I can get a similar effect from lacroix or soda water and you can crush as many of them as you want. It's just water. 
For me I always find keeping busy is the biggest save for me.  If I am just bored at home that is when I really start to think about drinking.  ..Other thing for me was just thinking not drinking either hour by hour or day by day.  I can do something to not drinking for an hour worry about that next hour after that.  I wish you the best!
