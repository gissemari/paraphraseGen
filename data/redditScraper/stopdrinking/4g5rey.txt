I've always heard that everyone dreams at night while they are sleeping sometimes you just don't remember them.  In the decades that I was drinking I had very few dreams that I remembered when I woke up...Now I dream pretty much every night at least once and I remember them.  And they are pretty weird.  It's nothing *bad* really just random people that I might have known years ago popping up and in these bizarre situations.  It's kind of entertaining I usually laugh in the morning and say 'Now that was strange'.  It's like my brain is preparing some David Lynch movie all day then lets it play out at night...One thing I didn't expect was dreams revolving around drinking.  I usually have one of these about once or twice a week.  In each scenario  I know that I had stopped drinking but I am in some situation where I have to decide whether or not to drink.  At times I've completely turned away from it at other times I've relapsed (in the dream).  Once I woke up and was convinced I was going to have a horrible hangover and would have to reset my sobriety date.  Luckily in no situation have I woken up with the desire to drink it is usually a horrible experience and I regret it.  ..I haven't really had cravings to drink during the day (except when playoff hockey started that was a trigger but I'm over it.).Just wondering if anyone else had had a similar experiences and has it changed with more sobriety.

This is very common there is a whole post about it that I think should be put on the sidebar. I love my vivid dreams it's so interesting to me to peel back the layers of what's going on in my subconscious after I wake up and mull them over.
In active addiction if we drink at night we can starve our bodies of REM sleep. As we get and stay sober it can take months for our body to catch up and find a new "normal". Vivid dreams are not at all unusual. Dreams that we were drinking  (even when we didn't!) van crop up randomly. I still have those dreams occasionally and it reminds me to be grateful when I wake up the next day...Keep going it gets better!
Vivid dreams are extremely common in early sobriety. My pal u/coolcrosby made this awesome post after contacting dream researchers.  [What do dreams mean?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2dit1m/what_do_drinking_dreams_mean/)
