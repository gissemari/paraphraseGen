The last time I relapsed was immediately following a doctor's appointment that went horribly...Today I went to that same doctor and got some bad news. Now I just want to crawl in a hole...But I'm not going to drink. Drinking will *not change anything* for the better...Everything in me wants to escape the present reality. I just want to be able to smile and relax and turn my brain off. I *know* alcohol can accomplish this for me today I can be in a worry-fee state of bliss in 15 minutes...But tomorrow *will* come. And all the anxiety will return (with interest)...Instead I'm going to deal with this today. Sober...And tomorrow instead of facing another dread-filled hangover I'll wake up and face another day's worth of challenges with a clear head. ..My badge number will be 14. And it will keep growing. No matter how many doctor's appointments go poorly. ..No matter what lemons life gives me I'm just gonna make sweet lemonade out of those motherfuckers like I'm running a damned juice bar...I'm **not** drinking...I'll look back and remember this day as that Black Friday I got very discouraging news from the doctor about a chronic situation I can't do anything to fix...*and I didn't drink.*..Instead of drinking I dealt with the reality. I sat inside the anxiety. I felt the sadness and disappointment. I even got a little angry...Then I took deep breaths. Meditated. Put things in perspective. ..I took control of my attitude and committed myself to make the best of the circumstances...And then I *moved forward*. ..Sober.

&gt;I took control of my attitude and committed myself to make the best of the circumstances...Damn straight!
Wow! Impressive.                .I'm sorry about the bad news you received. There's nothing however that drinking won't make worse. You seem to understand. Keep on taking care of yourself!
Good for you!  Keep things in perspective and stay strong!  14 days a a lot to be proud of!  Keep up the good work!  :)
