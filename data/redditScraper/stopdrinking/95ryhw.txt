I met my neighbor three weeks ago. Instantly I knew she had struggles too. Deep rooted. Maybe at this point perhaps a couple of decades. But I didn't care I have my issues too. ..The first two weeks we would hang out on our shared deck and drink. I would do most of the talking as she  introverted and shy. ..So I decided two days ago after five to six months of drinking nearly everyday that I needed to stop. ..I got rid of my beer and she had already told me she was beginning her cleanse next week. I gave it to her. Which now I feel terrible about. ..Besides she looks at me and says "Don't worry I'll save it for you. You'll be back". ..I've known her for three weeks and she has already made that assumption. And boy was that an eye opener. ..Random post random thought. .

Prove her wrong!! You got it
Proving her wrong will be great motivation...
OMG!! "You'll be back." What an AWFUL thing to say to someone who disclosed their desire for sobriety. IDK perhaps you didn't go into great detail with her about your struggles but we are here for you &lt;3
Yikes. Proving her wrong could be a great motivator. IWNDWYT.
I'm in the prove her wrong club too!  You can do this 
If you stay sober mebbe just mebbe she will see the benefits of your sobriety and try it as well...  
I've heard that or something very close to it...IWNDWYT!
I think I'd look towards a better example . Like lots of folks here !! You can do it !!!IWDWYT
Prove her wrong! Misery loves company!
