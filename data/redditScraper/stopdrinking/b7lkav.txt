I have requested a badge reset to today.  Just short of 3 months but it was my birthday on Friday and I've had a relapse coming for a bit (crabby at weekends FOMO all the usual stuff you hear on here)...&amp;#x200B;..I drank mindfully concious of the fact that I wasn't actually enjoying the 'buzz' at all.  I Feel like I've got it out of my system now.  Not too upset.  I feel like I needed to remind myself of the downsides and  I'm feeling suitably crappy this morning to do that. ..&amp;#x200B;..I read something lately which said that failure is not the opposite of success but rather \*an essential ingredient on the path to success\* and that's how I regard this episode.

"They" do say that relapse is a part of recovery. Not an essential ingredient for some but hey whatever it takes. (This from someone who has several relapses under her belt). I LOVE that you are not beating yourself up over it and just tossing it all to the wind. Right on! It's the journey. Lesson learnt as you said. Just for today IWNDWYT! And you are giving yourself the best BD gift! Another new sober day. 
Rereading this I realise that saying it's an *essential* part is bullshit. 
I am glad you're back on track and you are correct about not beating yourself up. I have read your comments as well. I believe you do understand that you don't want to relapse. A dependency counselor told me once that  you'll always have the opportunity for a relapse but not always the opportunity for a recovery . It has stuck with me it sounds morbid but a goal for me is that when I do die I die sober. I don't want a relapse to be the thing that kills me. .IWNDWYT
