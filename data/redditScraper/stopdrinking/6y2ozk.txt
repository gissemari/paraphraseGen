I've been sober a month in AA after a particularly bad relapse this summer. Things are going fairly well but I think I'm doing something that my gut tells me is addict-ey behavior. My semester in university is just starting so I'm not very busy yet. I'm left with a lot of free time and if I feel bored and lonely during the day sometimes I'll just want to sleep so I don't have to feel sad but I won't be tired enough to sleep so I'll take a benadryl. I'm obviously not getting high and nothing is wrong with naps but taking a pill because of my mood just seems like it could be a slippery slope. Thoughts?

I would say that falls cleanly in the realm of ***Substance Use Disorder*** yeah.
 while it's not actually an addictive drug it's the bahavior - avoiding life to nap..Nothing wrong with healthy napping if you got a lot going on thoo 
This is one of those things that I don't do for all the reasons that concern you.  Alcoholism for me is more than uncontrolled drinking it's also THINKING that gets disordered.  There is a solution in my experience but it requires sustained-time sober and engaging others in recovery on a daily basis.  I act my way into better thinking and in my case that involved jumping into the "middle of the bed" in recovery.
Could you use that time to walk around and explore places you normally wouldn't have? To replace an escape mechanism with something positive?
