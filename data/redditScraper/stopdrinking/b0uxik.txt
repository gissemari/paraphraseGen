I want to be clean and sober but I haven't been able to successfully quit yet. I went sober for 21 days in January but relapsed and haven't put it down since. I don't know what to do I've never been to a meeting or rehab or anything like that. I'm withdrawing pretty bad right now. .I just want advice on how to stay sober and is there anything that'll make these withdraws suck a little less ?

You might want to check out \[this info on withdrawal\]([https://www.mdcalc.com/ciwa-ar-alcohol-withdrawal](https://www.mdcalc.com/ciwa-ar-alcohol-withdrawal)). It can help you determine if your withdrawals require medical intervention. We're not doctors so we can't really advise you there but when in doubt I'd say go to the hospital. Withdrawal can be really dangerous and some of us (myself included) need help to stop drinking...Other than that the best thing for withdrawals is sleep and liquids (especially ones like Gatorade or Pedialyte that have electrolytes). Also food if you can keep it down. As for staying sober well stick around this sub! It's one of the best resources I've found as is the chat (link in the sidebar).
If you're having any of the more serious [withdrawal symptoms](http://hams.cc/withdrawal/) (which can peak around 3-4 days in) please speak to your doctor - there are medications such as Librium which can make things a lot safer and easier.....If you've never been to a meeting why not give it a try what could you possibly have to lose by just *trying* it? ..There's AA SMART Refuge Recovery LifeRing and others which all have a different flavour... you'll find a room full of people *just like you* who all experience the drug alcohol in much the same way you do the name on the door doesn't much matter.....I found the book 'Alcohol Explained' and the book/YouTube 'This Naked Mind' really helpful for understanding my drinking problem and permanently changing the way I view alcohol - they are well worth a look and made all the difference for me in stopping for good without feeling like I was missing anything or depriving myself.....If whatever you've tried so far hasn't done the trick try something different and keep trying!..Hang in there and keep us posted!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
