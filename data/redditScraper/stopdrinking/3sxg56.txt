I thought it would get easier and in some ways it has. The cravings are gone (mostly) and my habits have changed enough that every day isn't a struggle to remind myself not to drink. But the desire never really goes away. ..I guess I thought that if I didn't drink for long enough the desire to drink would just go away. It doesn't but it does become manageable. I still have to remain vigilant. I still have to remember all my old arguments and the reason why I don't want to drink...So I though I'd just check in and let everyone know I'm still sober. I'm not going to drink today. It's been a long time and I think I'd like to keep *not* drinking.

 Congrats on 2 years...&gt;and I think I'd like to keep not drinking. ..That's all that matters. 
Two years is awesome! Remembering still helps me too. 
&gt; I guess I thought that if I didn't drink for long enough the desire to drink would just go away...No less a person that Dr. Bob Smith co-founder of AA and one of the pioneering figures in the modern treatment movement says in his "personal story' that he battled cravings for 2 years.  Of course at that time the 12 Steps were just coming into being and a systematic approach to recovery hadn't been settled on. You are in luck there is help for this issue--personally I went to counseling and attended lots of AA meetings.  I can honestly say that effort squashed any remaining desire I had to drink again.  If this were me I'd ask myself this question: am I harboring a reservation about returning to drinking?  Why?
