I am 30 year old woman and I use alcohol to relax/come down from a busy week and/or to lubricate social events where I feel tense. I don't drink regularly (once a week max?) but when I do I go berserk and spend the next day alone feeling awful. I tend to leave my friends and just go drink and talk to people I don't know so I don't embarrass myself and so people don't know. I worry that I'm not going to survive one of my hangovers - that's how bad I feel. I really need help in order to stop getting in this state. Not very much seems to work - the gaps in between mean I forget how bad I am or hope it won't happen this time and as soon as I have my first sip I think - yay! this is awesome I love this I can do everything! Also if I don't go out I start to feel isolated. And if I go out without drinking I struggle to relax. Does anyone else have this experience?

yea i can relate to everything you said except im more of an every other day after hangovers drinker.  that first sip is all it takes to start spiraling out of control.  
"Does anyone else have this experience?"..I used to.   I don't now!..What you write "but when i do I go berserk and spend the next day alone feeling awful."..I realized that *Alcohol + Me = Undesired Consequences*..I decided to eliminate alcohol-associated consequences from my life...I spoke to a counselor.  She recommended meetings.  I went and got support tools resources and fellowship...I don't feel isolated.  I'm not anxious.  I have a whole group of Sober Friends to go with an awesome Sober Life...Hope the best for you...Today I forgo just ONE drink - The First One
