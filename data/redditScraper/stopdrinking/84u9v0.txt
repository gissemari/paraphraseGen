I went to the local liquor store to pick up some alcohol free beer yesterday. I recently moved here so I haven't been to this specific store before. Here in Sweden the liquor stores are state owned and have a mandate to help keep down problem drinking. The people that work there always approach you with a smile and positive vibes I assume in an attempt to show compassion for people struggling with addiction. This used to annoy me and made me feel bad about my habits...Yesterday when I went in one of the employees asked me if they could help me and it didn't annoy me at all in fact I appreciated the help in finding where they kept the non-alcoholic beverages. So I ended up responding to the positive vibes with my own and speeded up my visit at the same time. It's still a bit odd going into a chain that I used to solely frequent for the purpose of acquiring alcohol at least I haven't bought alcohol at this specific store before...I will not drink with you today.

I love that feeling.  The realization that no one here has seen my buy alcohol  and they never will. ..It's a funny feeling. I used to rotate the times I bought alcohol and the stores I would visit. I didn't want anyone "knowing me" as the guy that comes in and buy that box of wine daily...Also going to the store and not buying any alcohol always fills me with pride...as to say "look at all the alcohol I'm not buying today" ...I will not drink with you today. 
oh my gosh I love hearing about the government habits in other countries.  perky helpers in the liquor store?!  I kind of like that idea.  
Good vibes make defiant people upset.  Good vibes make relaxed people respond with more good vibes!    that's a nice NDV you had there codegasm!  Feels good doesn't it? IWNDWYT
