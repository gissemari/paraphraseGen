Had 5 years. Relapsed on Kava and weed. Got a couple months. Relapsed again. This time drinking kombucha and then mouthwash. That's the kind of drunk I am. I will put anything in my body to escape reality. My husband caught my drinking it. I even tried to tell him that's not what I was doing. .I feel awful. I don't want to be this person. I want to support my husband. His son was murdered January 12th. On January 13th I had 30 days. Last week I started drinking again. .He needs me 100% more than ever. Through his son's death we have gotten so much closer. He's my best friend. And for some reason I continue to sabotage our progress. .So here I am admitting I have a problem a serious one. .I'm so incredibly fortunate to have a husband that is also an addict and has been so so patient with me. I thanked him profusely for not giving up on me for being patient with me. Holy shit. Anyone else would have kicked my ass out..I know he will eventually start to process this and be angry about my lying. And that's understandable. We both to go therapy and I will continue to seek treatment. Obviously I need to work on being honest. I hope I don't damage this relationship irreparably. .I will not drink right now. I will stay present. I won't pick up today..
