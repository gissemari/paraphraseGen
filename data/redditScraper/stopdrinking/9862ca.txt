[It lasted less than 2 minutes.](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bml8I2bHLTm/?taken-by=hellabryanstyle)  (Sorry for clickbait)..I know I haven't participated too much around here but reading and seeing success stories throughout this year in my news feed has been a pivotal part of this accomplishment and I wanted to thank you all for camaraderie this community provides and the strength we all get from each other as we strive towards a common goal...On the other side of the coin nothing scares me more than reading a story about someone who had 5 10 or even 15 years under their belt and then relapsed. It reminds me that while this is a milestone there is still work to do and that the work is constant and unending. It means a ton to know that this community is here to reach out to if I am ever struggling...Much love and strength to you all as we continue this journey together.

Right. The more days you are sober the more certain and comfortable you become that you have beaten your addiction. At the same time however you become more and more anxious about the possibility of a relapse. I have just little over 40 days but the prospect of falling off the wagon and engaging in long and intensive alcoholic draught alreasy scares the shit out of me.
Recovery porn. Surprised it made it through the filters.
Smashed!  Congratulations on 1 year of Freedom!     
Yupp it can happen anytime so the crucial rule is one day at the time :) But don't stress yourself with it it doesn't mean it will happen. Nevertheless congrats on one year! IWNDWYT !!!
