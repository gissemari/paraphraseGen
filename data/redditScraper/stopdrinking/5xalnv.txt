One of the hardest things for me after relapsing after a year of sobriety was thinking how many days I had lost. This past month at times feels trivial. Then I thought what I sobriety really about? To me its about getting to do all the things that drunk me couldn't do or was incapable of seeing the joy in. Today My son is recovering from the flu so I get to spend the whole day with him. Days like this remind me why I am doing this and how there is a lot of joy in the little things. My commitment now rather than getting as many days as possible is filling the days with good things that are worth living for..

Sorry should have proof read that before submitting.
&gt; My commitment now rather than getting as many days as possible is filling the days with good things that are worth living for...I personally think the whole emphasis on how many continuous days you have is damaging to long term healthy living because when someone has a relapse whether it is 1 day 1 month or 1 year the individual sees that as throwing away all the time they spent sober before...Which is bullshit because if you had 1 year sober before those days are not gone now. They are a part of who you are now and the whole reason I stopped drinking is to get control of my life to become healthier and to be a better person. The number of continuous days in a row of being sober should not be the only measure of this goal.
Wise words indeed!
