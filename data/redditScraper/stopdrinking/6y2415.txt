yesterday was another day one..i know i am an alcoholic and was very actively in aa for two years..i relapsed for three months nearly ..and yesterday i didn't buy a bottle of dry red for the first time in ages..i live stream on younow as terminallyunique and my tumblr is pulp-blood if you're interested in keeping up with me on other social media and i hope to post here too. ..here's to always having the solution should we be desperate enough to choose it and live a path of sobriety and self realization ..much love to all my fellow alcoholics choosing that path

oh and i wouldn't post my social media that doesn't revolve around my road of relapse and recovery it's the topic of my accounts on those platforms and it's nice to have friends there too who understand it. 
Good on you for not drinking. Nice to have you here...Alcohol is never the solution. Not even near to *a* solution. I find the book "This Naked Mind" *tremendously* helpful to better understand alcohol and my relation to it without being bashed in the face or read the usual facts. You can buy it online or get a digital version for free from the sidebar (on the web; on mobile on the sub's front page hit the 3 dots at the top and select community information)..I'm not drinking with you today
