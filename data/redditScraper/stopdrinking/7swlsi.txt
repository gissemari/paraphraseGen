I relapsed/slipped up last night. I feel awful and shameful and all those things I ought to feel for letting my recovery myself and my husband down. He's really worried about me and I'm worried too. ..I was going to AA but I think I need to ramp up my resources. I think I need to do the 90.meetings/90 days and find myself a sponsor. Half-assing my recovery isn't working...I am so regretful for getting drunk last night. I feel deep shame. It's hard to even look in the mirror at the fuck up that I have become. Just needed to share somewhere.

Be regretful yes but don't feel shame unless you hurt someone. It is great the your husband cares and is worried. I cannot tell anyone cause no one knew I have been drinking for 10 years. I am a good sneek plus vodka hides nicely in a water bottle.....For me the first day I started drinking again no one noticed so OK why quit?..For me! Also because of what I could loose...Hour by hour or 15 min by 15 min. That is what I am doing now. Sometimes every 5 minutes. I don't believe in sponsors has not worked for anyone I know. I am lucky this time a friend and I are working together. He drank heavier than I did...Keep trying. That is the best we all can do.
Aint the shame just the fuckin worst? i think we all feel for ya here replace that shame with pride that you came right back here and held yourself accountable- that isnt easy and im proud of you for doing so.
Don't beat yourself up. I would look on it as a learning experience. What can you learn from your slip? What will be different next time?..You can do this!!  IWNDWYT
