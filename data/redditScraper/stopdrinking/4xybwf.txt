I hope i do not get criticized for this but I am 21.  I have drank at least 8 beers a night for the past 3 years and have struggled with depression.  Recently I was caught by my parents smoking pot and have already been to jail for related matters.  They told me I would be a failure and end up like my bipolar and drunk uncle.  I want to quit but I cannot seem to find a way to escape other than drinking.  I need mentors and advice.  My parents know i drink but do not knw how much.  I feel like there is nobody i can talk to even though there probably is.  My back is to the wall and I know i need support but am too embarrassed to talk about my problem in real life.  I simply cannot find joy in life without being under the influence and it has taken a lot of courage even from me to post this.  Advice welcome.  PS: I am an idiot

Hey there. Welcome to /r/stopdrinking. You have already taken the first step on your journey to stop. One thing I found helpful personally was ["The Baby Steps"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2gg9tp/where_to_start_stopping_the_baby_steps/) - Have a read and see what you make of it. I am glad you're here with us today. Stick around ;-)
Hiya. Welcome to SD. Why not grab a badge from the moderators and make a pledge on the Daily Check in? I find this helps with getting sober and staying stopped. Sending you best wishes. (And by the way you are not an idiot. Recognising you have a problem and seeking help makes you smart in my book).;-)
Welcome to SD! Never apologize for venting here! We're all hear for each other and are happy to listen. ..The daily check in helps me tremendously and there's the live chat for weak moments!
I'm 20 if that helps at all it sounds like you and I are in the same boat. Once I started getting withdrawal is when I started to quit and I wish I had done it earlier because withdrawal is a nightmare. One thing I've noticed about sobriety is the first few days suck so boring depressed all day long but it doesn't last. I started getting used to it and it wasn't so bad. I started finding enjoyment in things I normally wouldn't do sober and just completely new things. ..I'm here to talk if you need it I wish you the best of luck.
