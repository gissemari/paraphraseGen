After a ridiculous 3 week stretch in which I lost my job my ability to think clearly and most of my ambition I decided it was time once again to wrangle my alcoholism and take my sober life back...I've had streaks of sobriety in the last 3 years I've tried all kinds of methods to stay sober and the biggest contributor to every relapse was that I forgot to do the work necessary to remind me that there is a network of people just like me who struggle with the same issues...I've been hitting meetings reading walking calling people and best of all re-learning to love myself because without the booze I'm pretty damn awesome. This sub has been immeasurable in its ability to help me stay on track these last few days.  Thank you to each and every one of you struggling or not...I plan to hang around here for a good long while.  I'm looking forward to sharing all the best things about sobriety with you folks!
