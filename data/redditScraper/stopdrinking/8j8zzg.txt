My husband and all of his childhood friends are in a buddies wedding. I've been dreading this wedding for months. I've been sober 35 days (after a relapse prior was sober 6 months). I'm dreading it because I'm nervous as hell to be sober in that atmosphere my husband is in the wedding so I'll be somewhat alone and I'll be around our entire crew of peeps all heavy drinkers. I have my game plan mapped out for the wedding night to a T and I will be leaving early to go home with the kids  and my husband is getting a hotel and staying the night. Then the grooms dinner invite came     . I completely spaced that one out. My problem is I really don't want to go. I won't have my excuse that I need to leave cause my kids need to get home. I'll be extremely anxious the entire time and panicked from the social setting. I'd really like to sit this one out and  not have a sitter  for the night but I also don't want to skip another event because of me feeling uncomfortable around the atmosphere of drinking. Any advice or tips that have worked for you guys is much appreciated!!

Sobriety can last a long time if we nurture and respect it and make it our ultimate priority.  Whatever that looks like in whatever our situations are at whatever moment.  .I'm sober today regardless of what came up so far not because it was convenient to get sober   .Whatever we decide let it be in favour of life affirming choices    and we'll be ok.IWNDWYT ..
