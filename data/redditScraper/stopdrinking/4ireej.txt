Drinking remains to be not even a temptation. I'm struggling to recognize what I ignored in my drunken haze. How bad I let some things go in people I love and should have been there for.. One problem at a time. Some I may not have caused but I certainly didn't help and mau not get to fix.

I had similar feelings but was relieved to discover the tools contained in the 12 steps of AA for addressing issues of shame regret and amends.
I had  to recognize the past is writ in stone but the future is incredibly fluid. My actions today make me into the person i want to be.  If nothing else look to Ghandi "be the change you wish to see in the world."
