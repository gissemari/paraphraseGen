I've been struggling for a bit and controlling my sick habit at least fairly well but I could use some support online. Let's say I'm in a profession where I can't go to AA for help I don't have time. I just need someone to talk to daily in the small amount of time I have. Please help me change my life.

It may be worth telling us a little bit about yourself...How old are you? Male or female? Where in the world are you located?..If you really need someone to talk to PM me and I'll send you my phone number. Can't promise any long term support but I'm willing to talk today...
To add another resource to reddit:  http://www.smartrecovery.org  has online meetings and resources to help stay quit.
I haven't checked it out yet but there is a link to a chat room on the sidebar that you might be interested in.
Maybe the time you spent drinking could be used via a recovery group with analog life forms? I don't have much confidence with online groups. On the Internet no one knows that you're a dog.
