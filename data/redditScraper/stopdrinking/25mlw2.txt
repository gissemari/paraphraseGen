I MADE IT THREE WEEKS!.Feels good man feels good. ..But there is some poetic irony on today's situation. Our good friends are coming today for the weekend from halfway across the country. Haven't seen them in about a year. Definitely drinking/party buddies but the relationships are deeper than that. I'm not worried about the pressure. My friend knows about my situation and will be supportive. I asked her not to tell her significant other (because this sobriety thing was initially tied to my DUI) but it's hard to tell if she actually did or not. Nothing against her when you're in a partnership like me and my boyfriend it definitely wouldn't surprise me if she did :P. I also just told another friend who is coming from a few hours away to join in on the visit to avoid that pressure..These meetups always tend to have one big house party. Which I can be alright with if it's just ONE. I have tools and my boyfriend said he wouldn't drink as well to support me. They're just big old fashion friend reunions so I can't -I could but I almost done want to- ask not to do  it. ..However given the fact that three very supportive people are in on my decision the situation may organically not happen. But if it does I have found a mocktail sangria recipe to keep the fun on my side (pretty drinks go a long way for me sometimes). I know I know...dry people dry place...especially this early in sobriety. But this is a very isolated event and I refuse to be miserable when I get to see my best friend once a year. I'm not worried about relapse and I've had...pretty much all three weeks to mentally prepare for this visit. Just posting for some accountability ;)..Keep on keeping on!

Hello! Three weeks--well done! It sounds like you are preparing a safety net for yourself. Have a blast!
Wow /u/fixyourms -- 3 WEEKS!  I am so proud of you.  Stay accountable sober and live life; that's what I do.  I stay accountable by working my AA program and talking to my sponsor and sponsor-ees and other HOME GROUP members.
