hi guys..I must be fucking retarded. I got drunk again (tipsy?). why? because all my life I got my partners while drunk. So as on all my relapses I decided - I should get drunk to get laid. yeah like that will work...I am not 18 anymore. I don't even want to meet girls who are at the same part of life that I am. I want better yet I still don't put enough energy to grow...I used to be soo popular. As you could quess - I am not anymore. When I am sober I see so many eyes watching me. When i am drunk I see none. Because I am drunk because I act stupid. I am not sexy when I am drunk. Not at all...I want to be sober forever. No relationships before I am sober for at least a year. (so I could be better - better for a woman better for myself) But again and again I put myself into stupid situations. Jealousy. Fights. Drama. I dont want it anymore - yet it is all I am about. ..I don't even know why I still try and try ways to be happy that proved again and again to not be fruitful. I need to grow the fuck up. Yet I still keep on drinking and ignoring girls that keep eyeing me in the streets and at the bars. I tell myself - I will go out with my friends. I won't drink have a good time and talk with some girls. Yet it never happens. Sometimes I don't drink and have a good time. Sometimes I talk with some girls. But usually I drink. and nothing happens after that. I just drink and drink and drink...I understand that this post sounds very stupid. Yet it is how I feel right now. How I think. What I am right now. And I have to share it to let go of it. So here I am...TL:DR - I kill myself at least weekly to get laid yet it haven't happened for about four months. I know I should get sober but I don't because I am stupid. ..Thanks for being here. I will start meetings again. I will get sober I know it. But I want it sooner rather than later. I am trying to get sober for at least half a year now. There is some progress but it has to happen for real. I have to do it. I can't keep on doing it this way - I don't want to spend 10 more years drinking and filled with regrets...Thanks for reading and I hope there is a meeting tommorow. ..With love..Fullytruly

I have compassion for your struggles...Sounds like you zeroed in on your issues and want things to be different...I needed support fellowship meetings and working on my stuff to be successful.  Considering any if those?  Have some concrete plans?..Just for today I don't drink with you.
