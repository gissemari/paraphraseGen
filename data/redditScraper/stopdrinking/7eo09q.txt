What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** I took my mother to the USCIS office in Tampa so that she could renew her green card (she is not a citizen). Sobriety now makes it possible for me to do these things for my loved ones...**Struggle:** While we were at the USCIS office a woman had to be removed from the building screaming and crying. During my drinking days this might have been me and it was painful to watch...**General:** According to [this chart](https://i.imgur.com/AdppXUr.png) I am creative and fun-loving. (But really who doesn't love fun?)..What does your coffee say about you?.
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph: 6 months no alcohol 4 months no tobacco ..Struggle: wanting to date and be social historically both tied to drinking for me. Also I hate the holidays like all of them...I like any coffee without foam ideally a Ethiopian pour-over. So I guess I'm picky when given the chance but flexible 
Triumph: Wife went into labor three days earlier so we had to up our planned c section to today. So now I'm the happy father of twin girls...Struggle: Back to dirty stinky diapers. I'm almost a little thankful one of them is spending a precautionary night in the nicu so we can wean back into this...General: I enjoy me some iced coffee especially if the temps 50 degrees F or above but I don't need a straw. 
**Triumph:**  I'm doing it.  I'm wading through the muck blazing a trail to life on my terms.  It's verrrrry slow going but I'm still doing it.  That's something I guess...**Struggle:** How did I manage before?  My finances are so tight you could pluck a tune on them.  My time seems so short I can barely get a hike in a couple times a week.  It just boggles me.  How did I make shit work when I was drinking?  I am just scraping by. ..**General:**  According to the great coffee chart I am many things.  Mostly I am serious and focused.  
I'm an 'instant coffee with almond milk' girl. I believe that means I'm very refined! :)..Triumph: Got my health monthly premium down. Way down! $$.Struggle: Same as last week :( Construction noise!! Blurgh.
Triumph: refocused on sober excellence looking at groups to attend and really want to do some scientific research on addiction( any good videos or reading material let me know!)...Struggle: getting a few invites to birthday parties lately that I know are going to be all bar hopping. Trying to decide to go sober or not even approach that temptation...General: all black Columbian medium roast here. Says I'm serious and focused idk about that haha. But funny side note about coffee I just filled out a jury duty questionnaire and under special requests when serving jury duty I put  Starbucks Carmel macchiato with coconut milk  lol. 
Triumph: I'M A WHOLE WEEK SOBER!!!! This time last week I checked in on SD with a massive hangover and unbearable feelings of anxiety. This week I feel so much better. ..Struggle: I'm a bit lonely sometimes because all I do is work to keep busy then come home because I don't really have many friends where I live but I'm happy to be sober and lonely instead of drunk and lonely for now... ..General: My coffee habits depends on my mood. Any one of those things could be me so let's just say 'unpredictable!'..On another note though thanks so much for being here SD :) I couldn't have got through this first semi-hideous week without you all!! 
Good morning SD!..Triumph: 4 months sober! Went to a party sober too and although it was one of those sad don't-know-anyone parties i didn't drink! Am finally antidepressants free for the first time in almost 6 years!.In fact i just filmed myself dumping my leftover medicine in the toilet and flushing and sent it to my parents. What better way to break the news?..Struggle: This Net Neutrality thing wrecked me yesterday. I can pretty much only do a job i like on the internet soo.... Besides that i have a real hard time getting up in the morning. I wake up at 7 but usually get up around 8 and altho that's still on track with my day this has been giving me anxiety. Today it took me a hour and half to get up which completely wrecked my day. It frightens me because the loss of time is something i remember from when i was drinking and it just brings back negative feelings. So my day did not start too hot...General: I had a tarot card reading at the party. The reader said in my future there will be a lot of taking big loads on myself (i work 9-10 hours every day and also cook+do all house chores so... i can see that) and a struggle. My theory is the struggle is with seasonal depression brought on by the work and isolation combo. So i'm combating it with all my might.
**Triumph:** I am starting to feel better today even though I still spent most of the day/night crying as I mourn the loss of my friend. ..**Struggle:** The shitty part of this journey is losing people we care about along the way. I don't think it will ever get easier. ..**General:** I'm a coffee-to-go person cant mess around without that cardboard sleeve lol. 
**Triumph:** Learning to understand that my craving for *drunken oblivion* on Monday isn't an "all or nothing" situation..... With the support of you guys I didn't drink &amp; felt much calmer by Tuesday :) Oh &amp; writing my own Quirky Prayer at 5am this morning - which was about 13hrs ago.......**Struggle:** Trying to peacefully cope with my neighbours chaos it is ugly in my neighbourhood at the moment (worse then the usual Friday night stuff) because of the longer warmer days all &amp; sundry are congregating outside - walking past a group of 20+ drugged &amp; drunk people is fucking scary so I try to act brave smile at them make a joke..... when all I want to do is wet my pants &amp; never leave my house!!!..**General:** It's seems I am "traditional &amp; reserved" which kinda makes sense because I like how/who I am much better now that I am not a drunk wild child taking excessive risks or the sad alone drunk that I became..... *Still gotta keep a warped sense of humour though*!
**Triumph:**    21 months sober; 6-month anniversary with K on Saturday; I'm officially working for his company and started to re-build the structure yesterday. Growth is amazing but it needs to be accommodated accordingly...**Struggle:**    K and I have agreed that the 'business' does NOT come home with us and will not be discussed at the dinner table. May be tough to do but we can get through anything together ;)...**General:**    Apple Cider Vinegar - Cinnamon Honey flavor is my go-to right now.
Triumph: Became a US citizen..Struggle: Decided to celebrate with some drinks which turned into a 4 day long bender and now I'm up at 5:40 trying to do machine learning hw.
**T:** I had the energy to drop off the rascals at kindergarden stop by work and say hi buy a pair of jeans at the Salvation Army goodwill (I ve lost 15kg/32pounds) AND shovel snow from the driveway. A few months ago one of these things would leave me exhausted. I m tired in a good way now!.**S:** Today I have been ONE FULL YEAR sick from work. I m in Scandinavia so I don t complain. But it is not a good situation and I feel really bad about it..**G:** 10 cm/4 inches of snow so far today! It s wonderful to think of this as something nice and not a nuance.
Triumph: Held my daughter's hand on the way into her dance class yesterday I felt the warmth from her hand and I just felt happy and content more than I have in a long time...Struggle: I think my wife is having a hard time with me quitting drinking. She usually keeps it to a couple glasses of wine but I think she's a bit put off at the thought of losing her drinking partner or not being able to hang out with our friends in the same way we used too. ..General: I make my coffee at home so I guess it says I'm cheap and efficient? Lol
Triumph: 44 days sober just like that...Struggle: Still shedding the weight but making progress...General: 9 hours until 5 days off. Ready for a break...
Triumph :  My husband skipped his usual Tuesday night swim and suggested we go out for dinner something we hardly ever do. We ended up in a lovely local pub eating drinking Diet Coke and chatting for hours.                          .Struggle :  After 4 weeks I'm still not any further with the exercise!                        .General :  Drank my first cup of coffee in ages yesterday as I am getting sick of tea and apparently I am reflective but often indecisive and like the safe pick. That about sums me up!             .
Triumph: I was going to type "made it through" but no - "I enjoyed" a weekend getaway with old friends without drinking. .Struggle: Dealing with the awkwardness of telling old friends that I'm not drinking which brings a slew of questions and I don't feel confident enough in my sobriety to say that I'm quitting for good or that I had a drinking problem so instead make vague explanations about not drinking for awhile for better health..General: Feeling pretty good and very proud of my sobriety. I had one of those crazy dreams last night where I was drinking and was so relieved to wake up and realize it was just a dream!
Trumph: Refusing to spend Thanksgiving with my abusive husband.Struggle: Dealing with the fall out of above.General: I'm reflective but indecisive.  Very true!
Happy Wednesday!..Triumph: hit my double digit day yesterday! ..Struggle: watching a loved one battle addiction demons in a rather heartbreaking fashion :(..General: Folgers. Keeping it real. 
Triumph: well it's day three and that's not nothing. Although I've been working and I find those days easier to stay sober for...Struggle: the alcohol related insomnia is a struggle. I think I slept about 4 hours last night. This 12 hour shift is gonna be a bitch...General: iced coffee. I do enjoy straws. I might need to get some here this morning.
Triumph: My husband and I are vacation planning and so far no major fights have broken out. I had a thought; I can go anywhere in the world and not drink I just want it to be someplace warm...Struggle: The holidays are hard when a loved one is no longer here. I feel flat and dull like tomorrow is just another day and couldn't we just skip it and watch Netflix all day instead? That's not an option so I'll put on my happy face and get through it...General: I discovered last year in Mexico that what I would call a plain black coffee they call an Americano. So apparently I like watered down coffee :)
Triumph:  I guess it's 90 days!  That's a healthy decision I've made committed to and followed through with. ..Struggle:  I'm realizing that I have some very strong bad habits related to sleep that are negatively affecting my life.  As silly as it might sound I think for me hitting "snooze" in the morning is like taking that first drink.  If I just don't do it and get up when I've decided to things are fine.  But if I convince myself that one snooze is OK things spiral out of control and I end up snoozing 9 more times turning off my alarm and sleeping for much longer than I intended sometimes to disastrous consequences. And I've tried to "quit snoozing" SO many times and then after a day or two I seem to find an excuse that it's OK and I'm back at square one.  This is eye-opening and scary- what other deeply ingrained detrimental habits will I discover? :O  One day at a time I suppose- all I can do is just not take that first drink/snooze.....General: I've been adding "oat milk" to my coffee this week- it's surprisingly yummy!
Triumph: I remembered that my best friend started therapy today and went to grief therapy last night for the loss of her father and wasn't too fucked up to remember to ask her how it went and wish her luck. I was also COHERENT. Woah!!..Struggle: My uncle is in the hospital after a pretty serious operation but it looks like he's gonna be doing better soon. I also had a really annoying experience with someone trying to buy my naked pictures yesterday which was stressful and made me feel really lousy. ..General: I'm enthusiastic but obsessive! Unfortunately I can barely even keep my eyes awake right now and I've had a nice eight hours of sleep. 
Triumph: I'm sober and developing a plan to stay that way...Struggle: it's Wednesday which is usually the day of the week I start drinking. I can feel the anxiety and tension building. I received some great advice and tools yesterday so I'm working on it...General: coffee is becoming my new thing so I'm all over the place. I've been experimenting with syrups sweeteners flavors all kinds of stuff. For Christmas I'm getting myself a French Press a new grinder and a ton of accessories. Last time I tried to quit drinking I used drink  replacements  this time I'm going coffee!
Triumph:  Getting way closer to owning a house should close on the 30th..Struggle:  All the stress of buying the new place and getting rid of the old one is really pressing the whiskey button in my brain.  Another strange thing giving me the temptys is the inner argument of getting drunk in the new house to help "get comfortable" in it.  ..General:  I like my coffee like I like my women ground up and in my freezer. 
**Triumph:** Didn't buy any booze beer or wine for Thanksgiving. Not even for husband or guests. They can BYOB if they want to! (this was hard because I am a generous host - but decided I am not going to be an enabler...plus I saved a ton of $$!)..**Struggle:** To distract myself from drinking I have been hitting the gym HARD and I am sooooo sore. I guess that's better than being hungover though!..**General**: Sending everyone some love and peace. I seem to have some extra to share this week xoxo
Not today 
Triumph: Even though I was up a quite a bit in the middle of the night I got back to sleep and woke feeling not only rested but calm and content. THIS ALONE IS REASON ENOUGH TO NEVER DRINK AGAIN ..Struggle: Having trouble not overeating. Need to master that to really feel good about my health and feel like I can put my focus squarely on the next step in my career (whatever that is). ..General: Latte seeking to become Americano. 
**Triumph:** I'm getting a full-time job offer by the end of the month! It's been a long time coming but I'm so stoked to have healthcare and steady pay for the forseeable future...**Struggle:** My anxiety has been flaring up for the past five days. I managed to calm myself down a bit by climbing busting out my guitar and working on my bike. I can't tell if it's about this girl or the fact that I'm preparing to dive into my issues in therapy. Either way I'm ready to start working on my issues...**General:** Last night my family arrived to visit through Sunday morning. They're doing tourist-y stuff while I'm at work but afterwards I'm spending most of my time with them including Thanksgiving dinner at my place a day in NYC and lots of great food. I'm in a much better place than I was last Thanksgiving so I'm really looking forward to it :)
Triumph: didn't yell at my son's mother for being a shitty mom. ..Struggle: I hate that she has custody most of the time. I need to make moving to his city happen so I can rescue him from her fucked up ass family. ..General: I drink keurig coffee which says that I don't enjoy the taste and just crave the caffeine fix  
I will not drink with you today.
Not drinking today!!!
Triumph: I fell down and had to reset my badge and my pride- but I got back up. And just like I did it before I'll learn to walk again one foot in front of the other- one step at a time..Struggle: I was so confident that I had it locked down my first attempt and first time around the AA rooms that I feel shame now returning. I know they are always there for support but my personal pride made me waaaay too confident and now I feel ashamed going back..General: Basic Bitch. I'm the uber-complex no-foam extra hot skinny coconut milk latte kinda girl.
Triumph: I'm on a big road trip partially for vacation and partially to face where the last chapter of my life went wrong. I couldn't do this if I weren't sober...Struggle: Being back in my old town isn't easy. Lots of emotions coming to the surface lots of guilt depression stress shame...General: I camped in temperatures in the teens the last couple nights and LOVED IT
**Triumph:** I indulged at the office potluck yesterday and ate the things I wanted to eat instead of obsessing all day over food I want to eat but won't let myself eat...**Struggle:** I purged about a third of the food I ate yesterday and am now obsessing/feeling bad because I'm up 0.5 lbs from yesterday morning. I hate how my anorexia takes up just as much headspace as my drinking did although my drinking was harder to hide...**General:** Apparently I am reflective but indecisive lol. I usually throw in an extra shot of espresso so I am also hard-working and practical. This makes sense.
Triumph: 25 days sober..Struggle: To keep my work stress from derailing my sobriety. .General: I don't drink coffee.  But I do drink Diet Soda which I know is not a great habit to have but I will take it over drinking wine.
Triumph - I have reconnected with my sister and unblocked her in my phone  - a drunken night wedding fight   that brought me to sobriety also brought me to not speaking to get for three weeks. It nice to have that connection back :)..Struggle - my relationship and my boyfriends not being as successful at this sober journey as me and not being able to keep up on his finances which is due to buying booze he can't afford mostly. However now that Im sober these problems do not effect me as strongly. I used to worry at work about them cry about them yell about them get drunk and yell about them more. Now I handle them more calm and do not letctgdm effect my work day... Everybody make there own choices So the consequences of those choices are for that persin to deal or not deal with..General - coffee in the morning at work - it's free but kindah gross because they have powdered creamer . I'm still trying to find out what coffee i consistently like.  I get sugar free vanilla lattes at coffee shops! 
Triumph: Despite having a shitty start (restless slerp muscle pains etc) I had a pretty productive day at work where I achieved all my goals although we had challenging circumstances ..Struggle: I'm at a loss at finding a therapist. In my experience the "chemistry" has to work but I can't really test that without booking an appointment - which are around 90  . I can't really afford it right now either but I can't apply for the funded therapy without a therapist's name in the application form. And I really do need someone to talk to..General: even though I was diagnosed with recurring moderate depression I don't really feel that depressed at the moment. Usually November is the hardest time of year for me now it's just kinda meh. This is probably due to not poisoning myself on a regular basis :)
triumph: able to understand that i not being criticized at work but being coached. while this still feels uncomfortable i am allowing myself to feel the emotions associated with this process...struggle: feeling in my head a lot lately miss drinking just to escape at times...general: looking forward to tonight's little traditions: making the mac-n-cheese for tomorrow decorating my tree and eating pasta. :)
**Triumph:** Maintaining my sobriety is my biggest triumph at the moment. Also I guess hearing all the positive feedback at work and how much the nurses will miss working with me as a nurse assistant has been uplifting. It would have been nice to hear it *before* I decided to quit...**Struggle:** I failed the skills portion of my CNA test. I know it was because I was too nervous and missed steps I would never miss with an actual resident. I'm ashamed of myself. Also financial struggles. I just got paid last Saturday but after paying the bills I nearly got overdrawn on my account. I had to transfer some from savings and there's not much left in there either. My biggest fear is having to apply for public assistance if I can't get my certification soon or find a better paying job. It's been a battle to keep the suicidal thoughts at bay...**General:** According to the chart I'm calm and conscientious. I do want to point out that a good Americano does not taste watery :)
Triumph: non-alcoholic beer is my drink of choice.Struggles: Been dieting since I stopped drinking and haven't lost even a pound (so bloated!).General: enjoying having the house to myself for a week while SO is away working. The dogs sleep on the bed every night ;)
Triumph: Refocused on sobriety. for good..Struggle: Making choices to not attend social events for fear of slipping up. Rebuilding broken trust in relationship. .General: Iced coffee. Trying my hand at making a pie tonight...
Triumph: I worked up the courage to ask my parents for a new watch for Christmas -- lost the one that I'd had for about 8 years on my Hopefully Last Ever Bender and I have enough consecutive sober days under my belt that I feel confident asking for a new one...Struggle: Spending Thanksgiving break at my parents' house means that it's a lot harder to concentrate on studying when there are so many more relaxing things I could be doing!..General: I'm considering whipping up some holiday mocktails tomorrow! Anyone have any good recipes?
Triumph: Made it through some emotional doldrums without a drink...Struggle: Emotional doldrums...General: Americano! So true. I really do love the simple things in life.
Just wanna see my badge!
Triumph: I made it a full month today. Happy to see that 31 badge beside my name as I cant even say the last time I went this long without a drink.Struggle: having "user dreams" about drinking and doing cocaine (even though I haven't touched that for almost 10 years minus 2 slip ups a couple years ago) having these weird dreams almost nightly. I think it has more to do with a fear of slipping back into old patterns and habits then a desire to do it because every time I decide not to have a drink I feel happy and empowered. .General- might have found the perfect location to reopen my business going to look at it now fingers crossed. .Thank you everyone I don't post here much but reading through everyone's comments really helps me stay on track. Sending my love to those who knew DJ his passing away is very sad. IWNDWYT
T:  i slept for 15 hours!  ..S:  School.  I heard something on the radio about comedians bombing and not giving up.  Kinda motivatinng...G:  I'm calm and conscientious.   True.  I like watery coffee. ..  false but pretty accurate none the less.
Triumph: I just hit 8 months sober! I have spent more of this year sober than I have drinking and if you asked me back in January if this was possible I'd have gotten pissed. In a month I can have a "sobriety baby" at 9 months =P..Struggle: Life. My husband's job hangs in the balance right now and we depend on that money. No room for error there. And the holidays. His family really pisses me off...General: My coffee says I really just like ice cream ;)..
Triumph: managed to work past my anxiety and reply to an email about a possible job. ..Struggle: my anxiety and depression are really making it hard to continue every day ..General: I'm not ready to quit smoking!! 
Triumph: Up at 7:45am hit the gym actually made my own breakfast as opposed to microwaving something nasty and landed a new job! .Struggle: Trying to figure out what to do for my wife's birthday and how to handle being around alcohol and people partying..General: feeling really good so far. Only a few days in but I can do this. 
**Triumph:* I am exceptionally calm this holiday. No extended family in town. We're not even in town having left for a three day trip to a nearby tourist trap. One cave and two playgrounds into the day and we're all having fun...**Struggle:** Last week was exhausting at work and home. It's taken a few days to recover...**Personality Test:** I'm a pour-over or dark roast drip kind of guy. According to the chart I'm serious practical and hard-working.
Triumph: was discharged from the hospital following a suicide attempt and finally feeling excited for the future..Struggle: the holidays are here and I'm newly sober; however my mom and brother are being supportive and not drinking with me! ..General: looking forward to finally be a part of this community after forever lurking :)
**Triumph** Joined the r/stopdrinking community and wrote my first post! Not sure how this sub works but I'm mainly looking forward to reading people's stories and share mine...**Struggle** Coming to accept that I have an alcohol problem. I drink everyday in varying amounts but lately I've been having crazy hangovers in the morning. I drink by myself a lot and enjoy it most times. I just hate it the next morning...**General** I'm hoping that writing in this sub everyday keeps me accountable. I also journal but it's much better writing here knowing that there is a subreddit with a real community of people facing the same problems as me.
Triumph: my baby is fabulous and beautiful. I love being sober for her. Even though my badge is new I am so so much farther along than I was. I couldn't be a parent and an alcoholic. I can treasure her sober. ..Struggle: my parents are a complete shitshow right now. Like busting down doors in their own home sort of shitshow. I'm a pretty big enabler too.... ugh......General: I am taking the world's best bath right now. Face mask slats oils candles..... it's faaabulous. Much better than pouring a caffinated hard alcohol drink and fighting with my husband. 
Triump: 3 months sober. I'm sitting here enjoying beef jerky power aid and the Punisher...Struggle: during the holidays my family drinks. This is my first one without alcohol. The hard part is explaining to my friends and family why I quit...General: now that we don't have drinking in common. They left me at home while they drink and another friends house. I admit it hurts a little but I'm proud of myself for not giving into the peer pressure and temptation. 
TRIUMP  still not drinking.  Lost 34 lbs  facing my financial problems. ..Struggle. Still want to have a drink  25 more lbs to lose Facing my financial problems  ..General.   I am very boring  .   But I am happy and proud of myself. I look so much better. Part of me misses the times when I was buzzed (high on alcohol).   Ugh.  Life is hard work.
