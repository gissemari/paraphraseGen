The following is from a post on my blog which I will not link to avoid being a shameless self-promoter. I was thinking of you all the whole time I wrote it so I wanted to share with anyone interested. Thanks for reading if you do.     .     ..Robin Williams apparently killed himself yesterday. He had battled addiction for decades even putting 20 sober years together at one point; but sobriety didn't give him the weapons he needed to beat back his demons.      .     ..The general understanding of addiction is that it is a shelter from the storm   a building we dash into when the rain picks up hoping to wait it out at first not noticing that there's a gas leak or that the windows are painted shut and the door only opens from the outside. The general understanding of addiction is that the relief it provides is artificial and that it exacerbates the struggles of life. The general understanding of addiction is that if you manage to shake it you will find all sorts of strength in yourself and overcome whatever made you an addict in the first place.      .      ..But if you man-up and kick the door down before the fumes drop you to your knees it's still pouring outside. At first you'll be relieved that the air is clean   you can breathe! The fog lifts from your eyes and your pounding brain begins to settle. Thank God you've made it! ...Still raining though. You've got to get home and dry off but... where's home? A little unsettled from the fumes you're not quite sure which way you came from. The thunder crashes all around and through you the rain streams down into your eyes... nothing looks familiar. Your clothes are soaked as you trudge forward in whatever direction chilled to the bone and shivering. Every so often another building has its lights on   maybe you could just stop in for a minute to warm up... but no you don't want to risk getting trapped again. So you pull yourself onward moving free and breathing clean   but drenched cold and lost.      .      ..Last week I celebrated six months of sobriety. It's the longest I've been sober since I started drinking in my teens. Sometimes I feel grateful for it   my marriage has improved I've lost weight et cetera. Mostly it's been a challenge. The act of abstaining from alcohol hasn't itself been challenging; but confronting life without having a 'safe place' has been an intimidating constant struggle. Every problem seems more profound. Every worry breeds paralyzing fear. I obsess over sadness strife and death. I can't remember how to deal with life   if I ever knew at all. I know I don't want to drink but where is my healthy alternative? Where is my strength?      .      ..People who've been sober for a long time   sometimes they are referred to as  recovered addicts    have always been essential to my recovery. When I had 9 days and wanted nothing more than to go to the bar or when I had 60 days and felt that I had  kicked the habit  talking with folks who had years of sobriety would give me the perspective I needed to maintain my fortitude. What to make of this then? Robin had 20 years sober and relapsed. Then he struggled for another 10 years before finally seeing himself out. So you can walk in the rain for decades without finding home? At some point we all find ourselves throwing caution to the wind and running for shelter? Is the only answer to life besides addiction death?      .      ..Robin Williams was one man   a truly great man who positively affected the lives of millions with his talents   weathering his own unique storm; but it is difficult not to correlate his life and death with the tribulation of all addicts. After all we live with the same albatross around our necks. But instead of resigning myself to the same fate today I will honor his memory and his struggle by picking up the torch and pressing on. The sad truth of a crew traversing uncharted terrain is that some may be lost along the way; but we should learn from the mistakes of the fallen   don't step where they slipped don't swim where the current pulled them away. I am drenched cold and lost   but I am moving free and breathing clean and I will not drink today.      .      ..May you rest in peace O Captain My Captain.       .     .EDIT: Formatting
