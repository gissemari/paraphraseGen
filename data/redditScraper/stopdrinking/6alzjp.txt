I've been sober a little short of three years and I still struggle with feeling empty.  Its nothing new and I'm used to it but it has been wearing me down recently.  I don't want or feel the need to drink but sometimes I wish I could so that I could feel a bit more "normal" or a part of.  I know that from an AA standpoint I'm exhibiting addict behavior in sobriety since I try to fill that void with sex and adrenaline.  I did AA for my first two years but I stopped because in some ways it felt like AA and the rehab community was stagnant.  I don't mean to offend anyone that's just how I felt about it.  Anyway I know that women money etc won't make me feel any better about myself but at least it gives me something to focus on so that I'm not just focused on how everything I do will have little effect on how I feel.

Damn dude. I wish I had wise advice or an answer for this problem. All I can say is I understand it completely because I feel it too.
I feel frozen myself... very frustrating. .Hang in there!!
I hear you. I waver in and out of this too. Do you have a hobby that you love?  It may sound strange but doing a lot of dog training with my dog has been a really fun and positive thing for me.  Working with him really helps when I'm feeling numb or flatlined. 
Hey man multiple addict here as well.  Have you tried a therapist or social worker yet?  Did wonder for me I use to be in the exact same situation and now I am much better becuase of the help of multiple therapists.
