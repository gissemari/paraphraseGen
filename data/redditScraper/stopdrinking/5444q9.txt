As the title says I am a chronic relapser who keeps thinking I can drink normally. And some days I can. But left to my own devices I drink so fast that I pass out at 8pm and can't even enjoy my night. Then I spend so much time trying not to smell like booze. It's ridiculous. I know I shouldn't drink but I can't stop. I don't know what I can do. I know if I try to get sober again that in a week I'm going to think it's stupid and I can drink normally. How do I change those thoughts?

Good morning u/thirtyfour41 -- did you ever look at the [Baby Steps post?](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Those are the simple steps I took which worked for me.
Hang in there!! The Allen Carr Easy Way to Stop Drinking is a fantastic book. 
I spent years yo-yoing like that. Finally after 10 years or so of it reality sank in that I couldn't change it myself.  I would keep talking myself out of it probably forever because ...I was addicted to a highly addictive substance! So that's what they meant about powerless!..At that point I got others into my loop. I told my husband I needed to quit.  I went to some AA meetings. Simply the fact of going to the AA meetings helped me remember that I had a serious problem. It was hard to explain to myself why the hell I went to AA meetings if I really didn't have a problem.  Was I making it all up because I'm paranoid? ..It just was harder to rationalize once other people were in the picture.  Hope this helps. ..
