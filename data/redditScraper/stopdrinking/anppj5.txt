Every daily decision can lead to drink -- which it has with my recent relapse -- or it can lead to something better...To reinforce the idea that there are better things than drink my advice for myself and others whose idle hands are climbing the fence of the devil's playground would be to do something worthwhile and then write about it; I did this this and this instead of drinking in front of a film I won't remember by the time the credits role...It's not always easy to choose activity rather than drinking (not an activity) but reinforcing the positive time spent will never make you wish you'd drank instead...Give it a try if your urges are especially intense as mine are after my foolish needless relapse.

Welcome back. IWNDWYT 
Thank you for your post. You are right. I'm going to make an effort to jump on here and read if the urge comes on and then go read or run or do something I like. IWNDWYT
