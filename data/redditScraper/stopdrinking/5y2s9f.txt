So kinda a long story but I'm really hoping someone can relate. I was in a relationship for a long time with a man who I thought I'd marry. What I didn't see is that we were destroying eachother and drinking heavily together.  After him telling me that he never thought of a future with me and blah blah we broke up. It was a 7 year relationship.  I knew the last few years I need to quit drinking but kept relapsing with him. Everyone loved this guy and now that I'm not with him and not drinking everyone keeps saying "you were so much more fun when you were with (ex)..That's one thing...Another thing:..So about 9 months ago I started seeing another man who is awesome. He drinks but not a problem drinker and soon after we started dating he started seeing the problems with my drinking. He casually mentioned it at first. Then one night I blacked out and attacked him (yea wtf) and he called the police on me. He said I need to know how serious my behavior is. To be honest nobody has ever called out my bullshit like he has. With the ex it was always this "whatever" attitude. Now he is letting me see the real problems. The relationship we have is very promising otherwise and bless his soul for sticking around like this. He is even taking me to my first meeting tomorrow. He is very supportive and is helping me open my eyes to a life without drinking and being hungover - like doing things on Sundays that don't involve mimosas. ..So as you can see I currently only have 2 days under my belt because I relapsed over this weekend. It was awful. But when I went to the bar where my sister works everyone was saying things like "I guess he's letting you out now" or "did you break up with him?" And to top it off I didn't drink on new years and my sister got mad at me blamed it on him. He wasn't drinking that night to support me but he still drinks.  But she was all "he made you go home early and not drink"..Basically I really wish people would realize that this is my decision and I'm not doing this for some guy. Yea he helped me realize something I've been thinking for a while but I'm the one NOT DRINKING. He's way more clean cut than my ex and I've been known as a party girl. So what if I want to date a normal guy for once? I mean nobody is normal Haha but you get what I mean.  ..So my birthday is coming up and I feel like again people are going to judge me for not drinking and give him the side eye all night. I told him to drink a few beers so people wouldn't do that haha. .. I feel like he is being compared to drunk ex and people think he's controlling me. When in reality if you really think about it drunk ex was the one controlling me with alcohol. ..Thanks for whoever read this. I really needed to vent

Those people will come around and if not f--- em. Nobody should be concerned of your decision to abstain from drinking poison. It makes perfect sense to me. I won't drink with you today Best Wishes~
Well first of all: good for you! Keep trying. It's worth the fight! ..Second of all: your friends are being jerks and that sucks. Sorry! They obviously never viewed your drinking as a problem but they're opinion on what's a "problem" doesn't really matter if **you** feel like there's one. ..Back in the day my boyfriend (now husband) would bug the ever loving shit out of me every time I lit a cigarette. It was such a pain in my ass. So I quit smoking. I'd rather make out with this fine man than have a cigarette... sue me. How stupid would it sound if friends were mad at him for getting me to quit a disgusting unhealthy expensive habit?!..You keep doing you! I know it's hard but try not to listen to your friends. Or come up with a witty remark to have ready to go the next time they say something so dumb and unsupportive. Call them out for not being good friends. ..I think your new man is **awesome** and I love that he's supporting you. I won't drink with you. 
We can't control what people think about our sobriety. We can only show them over time that we change when we stop drinking and we are so much better for it. So people will never understand. As hard as it is try not to worry so much about what your friends think. If you believe in yourself thats all that matters.
Just tell them.  They aren't mind readers.
I have learned that your drinking friends will feel uncomfortable when you quit because it makes them look at their drinking. Their alcohol monster will do anything to keep from seeing the problem including trying to keep you under the spell. Just stay consistent the ones who are worth a damn will adjust to your new way of being the rest weren't your real friends in the first place. I'm proud of you for making a better life for yourself! 
You seem really self-aware and you're really sorting through some big and heavy things here. I think as long as you stay true to yourself and try to relate to people from a place of authenticity you'll be ok. Best to you.
I know exactly where you're coming from except it's only one person who thinks my SO forced me to stop and that would be my alcoholic mother. What sucks is that she didn't even tell me directly. Instead on one of her drunken nights she decided to tell my SO how she knows he looks down on me and thinks he's better than me. I was so mortified and I had to reassure him that it was her own insecurities talking but then we quickly realized that we have no control over what she says/does and there was no reason to discuss it. Point is as long as you are happy with YOUR choice that's all that matters!
You are doing the right thing!! 
People will talk about him for drinking and for not drinking don't worry about what front you guys are putting up - just do what comes naturally! It'll save energy. ..Maybe once you've got a few more days under your belt people will see the positive changes and stop giving you a hard time. Until then people will be people! ..Also its a bit sucky when people attribute your progress to a partner I've had that before and actually it was all me... They might support or trigger it but you're putting in the work!   keep at it
