Don't know what made me do it but it happened. I've been going through a lot of stress with my wedding coming up in a month building a house and work. It just kinda happened. I drank a pint of liqour everynight for almost two weeks straight. Today was the first day without a drink and now I'm laying in bed kicking my self cause I just put myself though withdrawals again. The last time it was one of the reasons I wanted to quit cause there's no worse feeling than having withdrawals. So if I make it though this time I'm done for good.

Fall seven times and stand up eight; you've got this !..Hopefully withdrawals won't be too bad this time...Do you plan to make some changes to prevent this from happening again ?
