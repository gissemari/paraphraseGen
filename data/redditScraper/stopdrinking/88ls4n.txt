So haven't checked in here in a while because well this "thing" is over for me: the spell the curse is broken...I worked at this every day for a good while checking in focusing on building a life outside of drinking...[2 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/7t5j6w/i_drank_but_not_to_relapse/) I decided to check to test if my feeling of "this is handled" was true. It was. Alcohol just didn't have that fun feel it used to...Since then I drank on one more occassion where I had the chance -- but the third time I had the chance I just didn't. Of all the things I want to do when I can do whatever I want drinking is just not it...I owe everyone here a huge debt of gratitude. The encouragement the companionship the camaraderie -- it rocks. This place and [the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/drunk/comments/6u6rfe/today_marks_100_days_in_a_row_of_me_getting_drunk/?) that got me here have turned my life around...I won't be a complete stranger -- but I got places to be now that I'm not living the 365/year alcoholic life :)

Good for you 
This is not how addiction works. 
I didn't know about your original post or how you came to stop drinking. 
Right on! 
I'm confused. Are you still drinking or are you abstinent again?
