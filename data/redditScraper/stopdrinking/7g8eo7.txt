Evening all as the name suggests a friend of mine who was sober for over a year relapsed last night...A few friends are rotating staying at his house so he isn't alone over the next few days but I have no experience in anything like this so any advice you can offer as to how best support him would be greatly appreciated...Thanks in advance I wish you all well.
