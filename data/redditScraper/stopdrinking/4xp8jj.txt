I have lost count on how many times I have relapsed and gone back to being sober.  It's been off and on for about five or six years.  This first week back to sobriety feels particularly illuminating and important.  My last relapse was one of the shittier ones.  Black out drunk almost knocking over a DJ booth at the club I was at crying for an hour and trying to run away from my loving partner into the busy street curling up in the back yard and trying to pass out under a shrub...eh. It goes on.  ..I think I had it in my head that I was entitled to a relapse every now and again.  You know. To remind me why I really shouldn't ever EVER drink.  I had it in my head that I could just have a crazy night here and there and then easy peasey lemon squeezey back to sobriety without a second thought.  ..This run in with relapse has left me with a renewed awareness about how the addict in me functions.  How addiction itself functions.  It's left me feeling so much more compassionate toward myself and also WAY more weary about settling in on the mindset that life'll be fine if I allow myself a drink every six months or so.  This shit don't play and it's not hyperbolic to say that this is literally a matter of life or death for me.  It's also made me sort of look at sobriety as a kind of warrior path.  Sobriety means coming face to face with your demons and then maybe going further and realizing they aren't actually demons at all.  They are wounds that need repairing holes in us that we can fill with mindfulness and love so we finally feel sated.  ..What a weird concept it is that the peace I've always sought through alcohol consumption was there all along.  I just needed the courage to trust fall back into a sober life.  Feeling all the happier that I will not be drinking today.

I know this is life or death for me too I also know my existence whilst alcohol dominated my life wasn't really living. I don't want to dip in and out of drinking I'm sure I'm better off this side of the line no matter what happens. Congrats on 7 days and thanks for sharing your insight.
