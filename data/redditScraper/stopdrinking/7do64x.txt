Not sure why must of been stress. A month ago I was sober for the longest time in 4 years. I had not had alcohol for a good 12 days and no weed for 9 days before life happens and your right back to where you were...Anyhow relapses happen..And this one was rough. Case a beer in two days gone. Trying to fall asleep but your dizzy as all hell because that "one more drink" really did you in this time and every other time this week...Will be at some social events with family this weekend. Im around one day since my last drink now I want to have a good time but I don't wanna feel like shit the whole time. I already said I am driving home so there is that point...Anyhow I am hoping this time I can relax and let the bad days come and go without drinking. Luckily I havn't had many urges today but I might need to "taper" this weekend and have enough to calm my senses which is 2 or 3. I know its not good to drink anything but if I can cut those 10-12 beer at a time drinking into 2 for the whole day I think that is a win.

Relapses don't have to come. What helped me avoid them was having a support system. I could never have stayed sober with my therapist who nudged me onto the road to recovery. There is more to getting well than simply not drinking. AA was also a great help and meetings gave hope and guidance.
