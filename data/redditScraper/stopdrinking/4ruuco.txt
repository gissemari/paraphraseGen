You don't have to ever drink again even if you want to. Be well friend. 
had similar happen to me. i was off for a few months and recently just caved in. similarly i didn't hit the bottom but i know that's exactly where i'm headed again. so yesterday i decided i wouldnt  let that happen. so i was sober yesterday sober now and will be sober tonight. and then i'll repeat that a day at a time..and this time will be different. i was more casual about quitting but i know better now and realize i'll just make the same mistakes again. not this time
Hitting the bottom hurts. I would rather avoid it. Besides I might need you soon as my tires are getting up there in age. 
I am sober 19days. It is hard on relationships- my husband won't stop drinking in front of me!  But it is our health and we must take one day at a time. We can do this! You can! Focus on yourself- and the rest will fall in place. Lots of best wishes!
Good for you!  Let us know how it goes.

It's okay to be sober and feel pain.
