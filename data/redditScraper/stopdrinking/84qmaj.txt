'Sup SD. Today is day 4. Before the weekend I had two weeks and a while ago I had a month sober. Apologies in advance for the whine and profanities (sorry I curse a lot haha)...To make a long story short this has been a long frustrating shitty week. My wife has been out of town since Tuesday so it's been solely on me to stay responsible and I have been. Tonight every attempt to keep myself busy after work has backfired in some way and put me in a shittier and shittier mood...My wife gets home tonight and that will be probably the hardest part of the week. My wife is also working on getting sober. We've been drinking buddies for the past 10 or so years. For the most part when we aren't together we're both fine but whenever we get together that's when the drinks start flowing. We're almost toxic to each other. I don't want to get into the specifics of our relationship because I don't think this is the place but when we drink together it's like all of our issues go away and we're happy together...It also doesn't help that I know she'll be grumpy and irritable when she gets home. I'll give her space and I know we'll probably end up going to bed with hardly any conversation...I'm not asking for relationship advice or anything... We'll work through that on our own. I guess for now I'm going to take solace in the little victories I've had this week and wait for the bomb to drop later and handle it then...Thanks for reading.

What so you think about cooking something for you and your wife? .It may take your mind of things and improve her mood..Afterward you could watch a movie like coco..You will get through this..
Hope that stir fry was yummy!
