I've posted here before but recently created a new account. Currently 642 days sober. ..My grandparents both died within 2 months of each other. It's been hard but we've all been coping as best we can. .But my dad who seemed to be doing alright had relapsed back in December shortly after grandma (his mother) passed. He's been drinking ever since. No one noticed it. He had just celebrated 11 years sober in November. ..He's currently in a rehab facility going through detox my step mom admitted him on Friday. I guess he had drank to excess and left her a note... she didn't go into too much detail on that part. ..I'm so lost right now. My heart hurts. I feel guilty for not checking in with him more and for not noticing the signs that are obvious in retrospect. I know it's not my fault and that there wasn't much anyone could've done to prevent this. But the weight of everything is just so heavy. ..My sobriety is safe for now I'm not worried about that at all I'm doing fine. But I'm just so concerned for my dad. I needed a place to come and vent it all. Everyone here is just so wonderful and supportive. Thank you all.

I am so sorry for all you and your family are going through. None of it is your fault but you can absolutely use those feelings to improve yourself and be even more supportive than you already have been. I always feel like when I am down on myself about something justified or not it's a perfect time to reflect on how I can be better. Thanks for coming here and sharing and venting. 
I am sorry about your situation. Life can sometimes be so tough. We can not do anything about the past but every new day is an opportunity to improve on the previous day. The sun will again shine anew every day. You will be ok. IWNDWYT.
