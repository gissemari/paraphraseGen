I quit drinking for the first time ever in December 2015 (when I was 25) and was sober for a year and 3 months before a VERY hard and painful fall off the wagon last year. Even though it was miserable it ended up being a good learning experience and here I am on the other side. :)..The most valuable thing I learned: getting sober after a relapse is harder than quitting the first time. Wish I'd known about that before picking up that first drink!..

Welcome back. Both of those streaks are great accomplishments and it's a good reminder for the rest of us that no matter how many months we have it doesn't take much to go back to old habits. Glad you're back at it. 
So happy for you to have made it back! Congrats on 6 months! Thank you for sharing!
