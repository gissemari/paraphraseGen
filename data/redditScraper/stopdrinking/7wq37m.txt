I didn't think I could pull this off but I'm 2 months sober as of last Saturday. This is the longest I've been sober since I left for basic training and with help from cognitive behavioral therapy and meds I feel great. Cravings are still an issue and I feel like I'm still making bone-headed mistakes but I suppose that's all part of the recovery process. For those of you that are reading this and struggling to stay sober don't give up on yourself! Do whatever you feel is right to get the help you need.

Congrats!!!! I'm also at two months and the cravings are coming back. I think it helps to accept they are a part of the process and to always remember they will pass. IWNDWYT!
Way to go! I'm proud of you! Glad youve got support  this shit's nearly impossible without help.
