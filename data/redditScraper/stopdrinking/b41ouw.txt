Good morning.  ..So I met my sponsor last night who is a great guy.  .He asked me something about the stopping drinking for good he asked me what I thought about never drinking ever again. .My response was that it was too much to handle and all I could hope for was to not drink today his response was hard but true. .He told me I need to get to a point where to drink is to die.....6 months ago at my worst I had nothing but a job and a house I had pushed everyone away and was hanging onto my job as best I could as was going through a redundancy process and despretly trying to find another job.  .If I had not found a job I know I would have drank myself to death It wouldnt have been death by alcholol in the medical sense but I would have killed myself it came that close.  .And I am going to hold onto that memory that close shave.  .It could be very different.  ..But here I am trying to be a little better and I have hope now hope from my sponsor from you fine peeps from the AA community.  ..Drinking = death.  ..But its Friday I am going to get me some dohnuts and take them into work for my colleagues I am seeing my kids later and going for pizza with a friend tonight.  .Which aint so bad.  ..Anyone struggling today I wish you well and send me a message reach out dont be alone.  ..Iwndwyt.
