----------immediate responses--------

Wonderful triumphs SFMary!  Thanks so much for your weekly Wednesdays. I look forward to them and appreciate the effort you put into making midweek a bit more interesting for all of us sobernauts. ..I'm there with you on the slob thing.  I am rebranding it "relaxed chaos" and trying to group like items of chaos together and be okay with the rest...**Triumph:**  MF-ing Xmas yo.  It was wild.  It was wonderful.  I'm glad it's over...**Struggle:** How'm'I supposed to get back on a regular healthy eating pattern when my ENTIRE dining room table is covered in candy and homemade goodies that people gifted me and my family.  I am going to need to make up some random-acts-of-kindness-Monday gift bags and hand out candy and treats to folks on the corners in the city.  Hopefully they can enjoy some sugar.  There is simply WAY too much in my house...**General:** Santa finally got me a soda stream!  So [sparkle cheers](https://i.imgur.com/nCZbq0l.jpg) to 2018!  You guys are bright stars in the winter sky. Shine on!
I will not and did not drink today
**Triumphs of 2017**.1. Made some positive solid financial decisions.2. Took a small holiday for the first time in years.3. Went past 2 years sober..**Struggles of 2017**.1. Closed my business.2. Cut contact with part of my family.3. Been sick more than I would have liked..**General:** Life is good... Hopefully 2018 is just a little bit  better. 
Day 2. Only recently sincerely gave devoted myself to quitting. This has been a miserable year but this time next year I know I will have good news :)
Yay! I love your triumphs u/sfgirlmary and I'm so happy and proud for you! I'm sorry about the MS issues; thinking of you and sending love and healing :). xo..**Triumphs 2017:**.Almost 2 years sober..Met and fell in love with *The One*; and I now have an extended family that I wouldn't trade for the world..I'm stronger. I will not be mistreated taken for granted and made to feel guilty for my drinking career. I can now say *FUCK YOU* to those few people that are currently doing this...**Struggle:**.I recently became aware that my family members have taken actions (legal financial) behind my back (from when I was *first* getting sober). I've been lied to and cheated. Someone is *NOT* playing fair. What they don't know? I'm already on it and I'm going to blow their fucking minds. **I'm SOBER. Do NOT fuck with me anymore.** The guilt doesn't work...**General:**.I hope this issue is not the final straw that tears the last of my family apart. If it is well...(Serenity Prayer begins).
Congrats on the art show! That's awesome.
**bold** Triumphs of 2017.1. I got married .2. I walked away from a situation that was incredibly stressful.3. I'm ending the year sober ..**bold** Struggles of 2017.1. Starting over with my Master's degree at a new school.2. Learning to communicate .3. Learning to trust and accept my emotions 
Thank you for hosting the What's Up Wednesday SFG! It helps me so much reading and sharing on this weekly thread. I wish you a joyful and healthy 2018 also!..**Triumphs of 2017:** Around 6 months ago I hit a year sober! And in 5 days I'll have spent my first calendar year as an adult entirely sober not a single drink in 2017! Somewhere in that year I quit smoking too :) Looking back I think this has been the most stable year I've had in a long time but maybe it's just that I deal with things so much better now...**Struggles of 2017:** All of my struggles this year boil down to life being life. I didn't have any major life events to get through and I've been able to get past all of the things that seemed really hard at the time. My relationship with my SO could use some work my diet is not great I have some minor health problems to address as I get older. ..**General** I'm looking forward to the new year! I've got plenty to work on still and who can know what the future will bring but I have a lot to be grateful for and optimism that it will continue being better.
**My triumphs of 2017:**..1. I lost 18 kg/40 pounds. Wasn t even obese just well kept now I m perfect. /s My old suit kept sliding off so I bought a new one today. Couldn t really afford it but it is *so - sweet* and looks like a million dollars saved on booze...2. The mrs and I had our first overseas vacation in five years (I m in Europe so "overseas" is quite doable). Five days without kids is the longest break in four years. The Mediterranean is so totally therapeutic!..3. I wrote my first magazine article in two years and the editor was immediately thrilled. Phew!!..**My struggles of 2017:**..1. I ve been on a sick leave all year vastly improved but still not enough...2. The solitude of everyone else working or busy struck much harder than anticipated...3. The situation surrounding my oldest son who is living with his mother is tough...**General:** The biggest single unexpected stroke of luck was to find SD. You guys are awesome!!
Triumphs:..After several decent efforts of 3 months here 3 months there with horrific benders in between I finally turned a corner realized I needed to do more than just not drink and pretend that was all there was to it. ...Found what seems to for me - reading and researching alcoholism and addiction constant but positive self-examination mindfulness and daily participation in this amazing community here.  ...Somehow changed my entire mindset so that I really don't WANT to drink even when my idiot brain tries to wax nostalgic. ...Went on a great little trip where I reconnected with an old friend and learned that I can socialize go out and have a great time without drinking without even feeling like I am missing anything. I did not realize before the trip how crucial it would be. No more lingering thoughts that there will be things I won't be able to do or that I will miss out. FOMO is gone (in all candor it does help that I am not in my 20s or even 30s and feel like I already had more than my share of the  fun ).....Struggles:.Professionally I had some really tough days filled with stress fear and guilt due to past mistakes. The old adage of accepting the things you cannot change is true but sometimes it is tricky determining what still CAN be done and when you have done all you can.  I think I am almost through all that. It was nearly overwhelming at times.  There were a few really dark days but I was able to weather them.  And those days were the exception in an otherwise beautiful year (if you begin the year in mid April lol)...Socially I feel there is something missing. It was probably necessary to isolate myself cut ties with some and recalibrate my friendships and relationships with others.  I don't know if my friends miss my drunk texts (they might) but they don't seem to appreciate radio silence.  Also I just need to get out more and probably date very carefully.   I have family so am rarely lonely but I do feel something missing. ....General:..Three friends died.  One I had not seen in many years but we were close in college. It was a shock to hear. Another died after a long bout with cancer. He was the kind of guy who had dozens of people who felt like and were among his closest friends.  The third was the most tragic. I found out he died then I found out it was suicide and somehow  it only got worse the more I found out. Just awful. ..My grandmother died after living an amazing rich full life. She even made death look easy and dignified and like everything else she did it well and seemed to do it on her terms. That was just before I got sober this last time and I'm not sure the timing is coincidental. I am not religious but sometimes I really think she is here with me helping me out lending me her tremendous strength and inner peace!
Triumphs: 1. Got a bike and lost weight/gained a hobby.2. Learned to dance passably.3. Got a promotion at work.4. Made friends with a new group..5. Commited to stop drinking after a long time of binging..6. Finally got a dog..Struggles: .1. Poor communication with my wife has led to a separation where I cant see my dog or some of my friends. .2. Still overeat which limits my fitness improvements. .3. Still live in a city im not crazy about and commute too far to work..4. I don't volunteer as much as I'd like to..General: looking forward to a sober summer next year and more adventure both physically and emotionally
amazing triumphs sfmary! you can add helping out people struggling to that list - you have helped me!..my triumphs:.1. put work into my sobriety proving that deep down i believe i am worth it..2. i got a nice promotion..3. lost some weight..my struggles of 2017..1. continue to exist in a very unhealthy relationship..2. feeling lonely as a result of my sobriety and the above struggle..3. my anger still remains an issue...general: i am glad that i am sober today and not just starting - the 107 days i am celebrating allow me to now focus on what was causing the drinking representing a bigger challenge in 2018 but one i feel better prepared to handle. ..i learned more about myself in the past 107 days and i plan on learning and growing even more. 
**Triumphs:**..* I started diving into my mental health...* I've made some pretty good friends...* I got a couple excellent jobs and insurance!..* I've lost 15 lbs!..**Struggles:** ..* I embraced loneliness. It sucks but it's necessary. ..* I learned more about my mental health which is super hard...* I'm learning about Christianity. I don't believe in God but I'm definitely curious as to what makes religion tick. ..**General:**..I'm glad I found this group. It's been helpful for me to have one steady place to explore what I'm going through. 
**2017 Triumphs:** I've made good progress with my anger issues. I ran 50 miles and will do it again. Coauthored a specialist technical book. Working on volume two and volume three comes next year. ..**2017 Struggle:** Depression is still a struggle. I'm a father so dealing with and worrying about how my kids will turn out is constant...**General:** 2017 was pretty good for me. I don't need to put it behind me but I'm anticipating continuing to move forward.
2017 triumph: ..I finally can say I'm done drinking and mean it!..Sold my business..Got hired at a new company ....2017 struggles:...Being hungover almost every day (besides the past 4 days)....Let's do this. 
Congratulations on the art show sfgirlmary! That sounds awesome...My triumphs of 2017:.*Still sober! This is my second holiday season sober. I can barely believe it. I rocked this season with cookies and presents and music..*I've lost weight and feel so much healthier..*I feel more comfortable in my skin. I'm a pretty cool person I think. In 2016 I never would have been able to say that about myself...Struggles of 2017:.*I'm still struggling with my nemesis resentment. I resent that I'm not healthier that my family members can be so self-centered and if I hear one more conversation between men about how they won't be nice to women anymore at work because of other people being sexual predators I'm going to scream..*I really have a problem with news and politics. I keep telling myself to stay away but I keep looking. .*I'm also struggling with decision paralysis. I'd like to do lots of positive things with my time but I'm overwhelmed with ideas and not so overwhelmed with energy...My 14 year old told me that his New Year's resolution is to go to church. I explained to him some of the reason why I don't go very often and committed to going with him. So that wouldn't have been my first choice of resolutions but sometimes the universe gives you what you need for a reason. I guess. 
My triumphs of 2017:.1. started a new job with more $ less commute and more appealing work.2. decided to start getting serious about not drinking.3. my kids are thriving in school and at their sports..My struggles of 2017:.1. most of the year was wasted drinking and blacking out.2. having the confidence that my parenting is good.3. lacking my own self confidence the past several years..General: I finally got my house semi-organized last week and now I want to completely gut it and get rid of non-essential items. Clean up the clutter!
Triumph- For me I must say my miracle of putting down alcohol forever March 20 2017!!  Learning to "play" the piano!  What a joy!  When it is your first year sober so many triumphs - first vacation- wedding etc etc - every event a triumph!!.STRUGGLES- trying to find new friends in recovery - dealing with friends that used to be drinking buddies - .GENERAL - Grateful for this site and all my sobernaut friends - they know what is what!!! 
Triumph of 2017.- Will be one year sober January 3 2018 (in a week!).- Have never been this fit or healthy in my life. .- Therapy is really clicking and antidepressants seemed to be the missing link ..Struggle 2017.- Still need to learn to drive .- Work place is not ideal and not sure where to go from here. .- Still finding hobbies and things I like to do to fill time. Getting my interest back in life has taken a bit longer than I anticipated. .
**My triumphs of 2017:**..* I have maintained an almost daily meditation practice for the entire year...* I have gracefully  (for the most part) and with compassion wended my through a separation and a divorce from my spouse of over 30 years.* I am living alone for the first time since 1984 in a sweet little house where I can have my own rhythms routines and peaceful quiet..* I've done really good work at work managing people and change while almost doubling the size of my department in personnel...**My struggles of 2017:**..* See second bullet above..* Financially the separation and divorce have been hard and I still don't quite know where I'll land..* Organizational politics and lack of transparency.  I'm still healing from getting fired in 2016 and it's hard for me to not know what the organization is doing especially when it affects my department...**General:**..I am happy healthy and committed to maintaining that...Blessings to you my friend /u/sfgirlmary.  Thank you for holding this space weekly and for being one of my SD buds.
#Triumphs..- Bought A house..- Stayed booze free..- Had a better understanding of who I am as a person..#Struggles..- Lack of physical attention from the wife has been maddening I think we were intimate maybe 15 times this year..- Watching aspects of my sisters life crumble to booze. ..- Finding worth in myself as a romantic person.
Triumphs 2017:.-I wrote a book this summer!.- Got a 4.0 GPA y'all.- First relationship???  .- Started exploring religious ideas.- Ran a 5k! ..Struggles: .-Semi-regular binge drinking throughout all of this.- That first relationship? Started drunk ended drunk. Yikes! .- All the failed  get sober  attempts.....- Still not sure if I'm gay actually ?..2018 is gonna be my greatest year yet! I conquered depression now I'm ready to truly get into my best habits and best life.
Triumph: Handled 3 days of holiday festivity with my large hard-drinking loud opinionated extended family. Also dragged myself to the dentist today and survived cavity-free (though I got a lecture about tartar buildup  )...Struggle: Dealing with a nasty cold/sinus infection. Also fighting some unresolved feelings about a past relationship...General: I'm looking forward to a quiet new year's celebration. I'm truly excited that I don't feel  obligated  to party it up. I want to dress comfy and do a jigsaw puzzle :)
T(s):  I got a new car.  I've been driving for 2 decades and it's the first time I've had a decent reliable car.  ..First full year of being a single full time Dad.  It's been difficult but I made it a year...I feel like I've made a lot of progress in finding out who I am.  ..S(s):  Things have been hell with school being a single parent and my Dad got hurt at work so I was taking care of him...I still feel like drinking.  There's still a part of me that wants to get F'd up.  It's still there but I'm better at handling that little voice.  I'm not afraid of it either...Just still trying to put my life together.  I'm making progress but everything still feels like a mess...G:  I came really close to drinking right before I hit a year.  I wouldn't say this has been a great year but if I had relapsed it could have been infinitely worse.

I'm sorry to hear about your MS issues Mary.   A good friend of mine struggles with it as well.  Hope things even out!  I'm also trying to work on my messiness so I can move beyond that and do other things than constantly clean up after myself. And huzzah for the sold out show!!..**Triumphs of 2017:**..1.  Sober for over 900 days and despite ups and downs still feeling committed...2.  I am learning how to be a responsible homeowner and can feel myself growing up after decades of emotionally retarding myself with booze...3.  I went backpacking twice with some really interesting folks which was actually one of my 2017 goals...**Struggles of 2017:**..1.  I know deep down that I should not stay in my current relationship but I am hanging in to learn more about how to be a good partner and also out of a desire for security.  I despise that desire fore safety which leads me around by the nose as much as booze ever did...2.  My job sucks my soul and I feel stuck but that desire for security keeps me from looking hard for something else...3.  I really wanted to find/create a community of like-minded folks and that's been hard.  ..**General:**  I am determined not to give up on myself and my dreams and I will set new goals for 2018.  And in only 88 days I hit 1000 days of sobriety - amazing!!
**Triumphs:** .- 1. Quit drinking in mid August..- 2. Have seen marked gains in health and fitness..- 3. My brain is working better..- 4. Extra energy that I'm putting towards organizing cleaning de-cluttering..- 5. Have enjoyed concerts holidays with family and a tropical vacation while remaining sober..- 6. At age 54 I'm finally feeling like I'm starting to grow up...**Struggles:**.- 1: my relationship with my active alcoholic wife has been a roller coaster ride.  There are times that it's so bad that I just want to walk away but I still love her plus I was her drinking buddy for a couple of decades so I feel hypocritical for even considering it.  And neither of us would get to retire with the same standard of living we currently enjoy (and that I have worked my whole life for). I don't see this struggle changing in 2018 either. sigh...**General:**  The people on this (and the AlAnon) sub have been absolute game changers for me on this sober journey.  I literally would not be where I am today with out you all.  Thanks a ton and have a truly blessed and happy 2018.
**Triumphs 2017**.1. Got a new contract with some non-monetary goodies.2. Cleaned the basement it's now a personal workshop for bikes .3. Found 0.25 bitcoin from 2015 on an old account ;-)..**Struggles 2017**.1. It was close! The work results were not good due to my alcoholic problem.2. Did no bigger cycle-trip at all.3. +10kg this year..**General:** Better organization of daily routine. Distinguish between work and freetime. Do a cycle trip next year *very important!*
Triumphs .1. Got a new job (first paid job in many years).2. Moved to a new city.3. 6 months sober!..Struggles.1. Heart wrenching break up.2. Surviving that round of  firsts' sober. Never realized how many feelings and frustrations I extinguished with alcohol. No wonder I walked with a pervasive feeling of stuck-ness.3. I have 8 months to finish my dissertation. The pressure is difficult but trying to keep the faith in myself..General.Excited for a 2018 that may bring with it tons of joyful sober moments and movement forward..I love this community. I honestly don't think I would have gotten this far without all of you beautiful and brave people. Thank you    
Hi guys very new to reddit and this thread and sobriety also but was recommended by a friend. This is day one for me; look forward to contributing to your awesome community more fully in the future but for now I just wanted to say hi. Thank you : )
Triumphs of 2017:.1. I travelled by myself in an aeroplane - I was terrified of flying; I have done it twice and I have more flights booked. This has opened up the world for me. I'm going to England with my Dad next year!..2. I think I have been a good friend an family member. I have been less flakey and I have been supportive to people around me without 'over-committing' or putting myself in an emotional deficit. I usually struggle to maintain friendships because I'm quite self absorbed and not super empathetic but I feel that I have really developed a lot in this area...3. I chose not to drink. It's a recent change but I feel that it is the most important change I have made this year - orossibly ever. ..Struggles of 2017:.1. I watched my Mum slowly die in hospice. It was horrendous - I don't even have words. I'm so glad that I had my Dad and sister with me and that the whole experience has bonded us eternally as a family. I'm even grateful that I had alcohol to facilitate my shock and grief during this time - it was one of the only things that kept me together. I miss her every single day. ..1b. I helped Dad organise Mum's funeral and cremation and I delivered the eulogy for her (part triumph) in front of 300 people. ..2. I started a new job - a scary experience but (triumph) I love it now!..3. My little cat (aged 11) died. She was so sweet and beautiful - I feel very guilty (she ingested something toxic) and I miss her so much. ..Musings: I chose the worst year of my life (and the worst time of year) to stop drinking I have been sober for 18 days - including Christmas Eve Christmas Day Boxing Day end of work drinks etc. I have been to a pub and a freaking brewery and sipped soda water. ..I won't drink with you all today x
Well 2017 has been a hell of a year for me. Most notably because it's the first time I've actually taken real steps to get professional help for my mental health. This has led to a lot of improvements but also changes. Some of which were difficult to make but are worth it in the long run. It was the year of change for sure. But as one of my favorite quotes states:.."The only constant is change." .*Heraclitus*..**Triumphs of 2017**.* Finally got the professional help I've been needing for years. Seeing a therapist once a week now. .* Reconnected with a large part of my family and went low contact with my mother. .* Visited my home town for the first time in 8 years after having thought I'd never go back. It was wonderfully cathartic. ..**Struggles of 2017**.* Cheated on my SO during a binge. (Oh hi rock bottom) .* Coming to the realization that I suffer from alcoholism .* The situation at work has been getting worse and worse. Struggling with management and things like 'Is this really what I want to do with my life?' and if the answer is no then 'What **do** I want to do with my life?' ..**General:**.Life has gotten a lot better in 2017. Time to fine tune it in 2018. ;)
