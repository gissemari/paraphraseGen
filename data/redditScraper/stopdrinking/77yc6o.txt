Hello it's been about 2.5 years since I've chosen to put a drink or drug in my body. Only been on reddit for about a month though and brand new to this sub.  Just wanted to introduce myself and say hi and thanks for all the great posts to read through. Daily reminders and support have been crucial for keeping me sober this long. Why not add another support structure in my life? This seems like a good community.. Past two months have been tough on me. A lot of work stress which has disrupted my normal meeting schedule and thrown my work/life balance out of wack. Thought I was doing fine plowing through it but I've recently realized I'm letting myself slip. I.e. Feeling sorry for myself isolating blaming/criticizing others binge eating shopping therapy overindulging my inner sloth etc. ( I could add to the list infinitum ). It's nothing too drastic but it's creeping up on me. Today I caught myself fantasizing the drink- mainly the "fuck it I don't care about anyone or anything" attitude I adopted with drinking which allowed me to behave carelessly recklessly and selfishly. Like I just wanted to get blackout and wreck some shit.I caught myself played the tape through and didn't drink today. It wasn't even like a craving- just a strong alcoholic thought. It's been awhile since that happened and I've taken it for granted.  It was all day every day for the first 4-6 months for me.  Need to start back with daily gratitude. Gratitude carried me through many tough spots in the beginning. Im so grateful to be sober today to know I'm not alone to not be shaking or puking blood to have sober friends to be gainfully employed to have the trust of others to have a chance at growth to grow to have the opportunity to get through tough days and be stronger for it and so on and so forth.  I'm grateful for you all too. Although we're strangers we share a common bond. Reading the struggling persons posts that may only have a few days helps just as the replies comments and posts do too. I don't know where I'm going with this...to bed I guess. But hello! Thanks for being here y'all! There's not a single problem that a drunk can't make worse. Good night...
