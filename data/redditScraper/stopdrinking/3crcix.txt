I relapsed tonight. Its very strange. Its almost like after you make it to a certain point in the recovery process you start to invent an alternative reality where maybe you never had a "problem" at all. Then at the end of the night when you know the fun is over and you have to go to bed you sink back to square one.

Sending you positive thoughts.  Hope to see you back here tomorrow and the days after that.

I have to get outside cues to remind myself that I am an alcoholic. AA meetings are tremendously helpful to me. I can listen to other people share and think 'yeah I think and feel that way too so I must still be an alcoholic.'
&gt; . Its almost like after you make it to a certain point in the recovery process you start to invent an alternative reality where maybe you never had a "problem" at all...That's an astute observation.  Yep it's exactly like that.  That's why my decision to quit has nothing to do with whether I *can* drink or not.  I stopped drinking because I said I was going to stop drinking.  Whether I have a problem or not is immaterial. ..&gt; at the end of the night when you know the fun is over and you have to go to bed you sink back to square one....How so?  Who's stopping you from drinking? If drinking is that much fun keep it up.  YOLO..
I've been 'cured' myself a number of times but every single time ended up back in the same place... This time I'm doing things differently.  Welcome back and I hope you aren't too angry at yourself tomorrow.
