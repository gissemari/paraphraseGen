So  i checked in earlier as I was walking to a wine bar for a friend's birthday. A bunch of old friends from a class we all took together came and we're all gathered around a community table. I'm having soda water naturally but everyone else is having beer or wine. ...A friend of mine stockier dude was drinking Stellas. On his fourth he hesitated when the bartender asked if he wanted another like "oh I don't know...ah hell sure one more." So. He drinks his beer this is his fifth (I wasnt counting he mentioned it's his 5th) and when he finishes it the bartender asks if he wants another. This time he goes "oh no I'm good thanks." And the bartender walks away. But he comes back at some point to refill other drinks and asks again! And not like "you still all set? Can I get you anything at all?" But like...pushy as shit. "Are you SURE you don't want a beer? Are you suuuure?" Kinda shaking him back and forth by the shoulders like they're friends. I can see my friend struggling with it. ..Dude. He said no. Go overpour someone else. I actually got snippy and smiled that "I'll eat you alive then ask for your manager" smile and go "I think he's sure thank you." I mean my friend wasnt falling off his stool or anything...Idk.  It just really irked me. I'm a binger. When I get up to 5 drinks I absolutely can't say no and if I HAD managed to keep a cool head and decline another drink (it happened...sometimes...) I would have been undone by the pushy bartender. Meanwhile I had to about suck him off for another soda water. Ass. ..But overall successful night. Was offered a shot laughed and said "not this kid I never do shots." (Which is true even before a few days ago when I quit) and I had a nice time. I didn't spend 40 bucks on a bar tab I didn't try to get as drunk as I could in the time i was at the bar (two hours) and I saw some old friends. :)

Yeah there are a lot of reasons why [the least popular advice in early sobriety is dry people dry places](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2szkp8/the_least_popular_advice_dry_people_dry_places/?ref=search_posts) and that's one of them.
Bartender is just doing his job he's a salesman in the end. No need to vilify him. 
Don't have to worry about pushy bartenders if I'm not in a bar. It's tough to stay sober it's even harder when I put myself in compromising positions early on.
