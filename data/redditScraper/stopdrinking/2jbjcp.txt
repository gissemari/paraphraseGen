Oh.. hey.  It's Wednesday again isn't it?..The week's half over.  It's time to share your triumphs and your struggles.  And maybe if you met another /r/stopdrinking member say something nice about them...**Triumph**: I was in a funk over the weekend for a number of reasons.  I found myself up watching mindless TV at 2 AM.  It was in line with my old behavior that got me a lots of trouble.  However instead of pounding drink after drink I was eating some chips and salsa.  Not the *best* behavior but much better than alcohol.  And still better than eating cake at 2 AM.  We do have alcohol in the house and I wasn't even tempted (didn't even think about it).  Feels like a triumph here.  Feels l like I've changed my behavior and my reactions...**Struggle**: Just dealing with some work/personal/etc things that have me down a bit.  I'm sure it won't last...**General Chat**: Trying to change my mindset about a tennis league I'm in.  It's a league which most of the players are below me skill-wise and I'm trying to find a way of having fun...**Meetup Note**: I finally got to meet cake_or_radish.  She's been a positive part of my recovery from way back and I hope I've been positive for hers.  It was awesome to finally put a face & voice to the username.

What's up Wednesday?!?..**Triumph**: I have a couple.  Reconnected with a close friend I haven't talked to in awhile (she lives across the world from me) and finally came clean with her about getting sober and my struggles with depression.  It felt really good to know she still has my back.  I also busted a PR at the gym this morning that I'd been stalling on for several weeks.  ..**Struggle**: I just used my new blender to explode a protein shake all over my kitchen.  Apparently I struggle with directions.  I need an adult...**General chat**: I was sick this week and woke up Monday morning feeling EXACTLY like I had a hangover.  Nausea chills blinding headache.  But somehow even as I was barfing (TMI?) it still felt good to know that it wasn't from drinking just from my body battling some villainous microbes!  
* **Triumphs:**. * powered through a bench plateau on Monday by shooting *mind bullets* at the problem (lift smarter not harder; also: brought creatine back into the mix).. * Run the Jewels dropped [another single](https://soundcloud.com/massappealrecs/close-your-eyes-and-count-to-fuck-feat-zack-de-la-rocha/s-PwPP5) that threatens to snap every neck and blow out every car speaker.. * [Meow the Jewels](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1957344648/meow-the-jewels) might actually happen which is just the internet being the internet the best way possible. * Shooting at an Appleseed this weekend way better than shooting with a hangover tell ya what. * Some babe gave me her number. This whole looking approachable and physically attractive thing is *okay*. Still have to work on "how do I talk to people.". * That number is getting close to another number...* **Struggles:**. *  Old this-time-of-year things keep coming up:.     * Playoff baseball and Monday/Thursday Football while walking by bars (I don't even follow sports just something to look at/people to hang with while drinking. That's how I transitioned to weekday drinking.).     * It's very dark in the morning when I go to the gym but having a lamp alarm clock has made that much better. Also 2 stage alarm: 5:30 take preworkout snooze until 5:50 when it kicks in then go lift..     * Summer's done and I din't go on any epic vacations anywhere.. * I don't really want to pursue that girl I've been texting with. Might just stop texting her? I feel like there's no room for anyone else in my life right now and I don't know how that could change. Pretty sure I don't want it to change right now to be honest.. * Kind of anxious to be out of town this weekend and not making my own schedule and sticking to my food plan 100%. Food plan takes the self-control aspect out of the compulsive eating.. * Edit: A dude from the rooms went out for the last time. The hard way. 38 years old. Didn't know him that well. Just a fun reminder that this thing doesn't want us cranky fat bored restless unfulfilled whatever; it wants us fucking dead...* **General:**. * Giving and getting a lot of love right now. That's a good thing. Catching a few feelings a little too hard; that might be a bad thing? Letting those simmer like Pam and Jim not forcing anything like Kelly and Ryan.. * I have it on [good authority](http://imgur.com/xRQl48Z) that we're all gonna fuckin' make it.
**Triumph:** Hmm I've definitely had a lot of cravings the past few weeks to go out and drink. But I didn't! And I'm this far on only 2 chips so I'm happy. I'm having a good week at work I decided to take off my last day because fuck the police! So today is it and I have a three day weekend. I'm also due to donate blood and pick up my four month chip. It will be a good weekend. ..**Struggle:** I reapplied to my university last week and should be hearing the news here shortly as to whether or not I'll get accepted back in. I drank myself down to a 1.9 GPA and pretty much laid everything out in the statement of readiness. I'm going to be stressed no matter whether I got in or not. If I don't get in I'm going to apply to my local police department and if I did get in I am in to get my guts stomped out next semester working and going to school full time. But this time I'm sober! ..**General Chat:** My roommate is going to be out of town for about a week and is leaving me to take care of his cats while he is gone. I'm considering having some people from AA over for a small get together but I don't know if it's a good idea. I've never been able to be a good host at anything so I don't know. I also don't know a whole lot about the background of some of the people I would be inviting over. So maybe I won't have this get together. 
Triumph: Got free-cell test results back and my future baby is healthy and a girl. HUZZAH!..Struggle: Today all is well...General Chat: Three meetings in the last four days and my mindset is great. Coincidence???
**Triumph**: Decided to try and quit drinking again. Didn't drink yesterday and I won't today. ..**Struggle**: I tried and failed at this earlier this year. I lasted two months but I didn't seek out any support and I didn't replace my drinking friends and lifestyle with anything sufficient to stop me eventually getting bored and lonely. I'm scared that will happen again...**General Chat**: There was a good discussion on here yesterday about the loss of friends. girliesogroovyy wrote something beautiful and inspiring about the sober friendships she found and how AA helped make that possible. I could have gone to a meeting yesterday but I was too hungover to make it. I think I'm going to go next week..
I just posted some of it......**triumph** .I get my one year sobriety gift from my mother it's in my post "that's it I'm making a cape!".**trial**.Cutting out processed sugar.....shit is in everything! I just hope it doesn't narrow me down to un seasoned rice cakes and cardboard...could be argued there isn't a difference..**general chat**.I'm loving the fall colors. Pic is Meridian Hill Park also known as Malcomb X park in Washington DC not far from DuPont a Circle on 16th. Beautiful..... http://i.imgur.com/GH1LVzv.jpg 
Triumph: No real cravings. Feeling more grounded than ever in my recovery. Kicked ass at my guitar lesson on Monday. ..Struggle: Still incredibly incredibly turned off to AA after yesterday's meeting fiasco. Laying off my Thursday meeting to cool off a bit and come back fresh with new meetings next week. Actively looking into alternatives around me in LA. Trying to get a handle on dealing with anxiety now that my wits are less dulled. ..General Chat: I hope we're out of the woods with the heat though I expect one last blast from the Santa Anas. I have been laughing at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OloLS5kTrVs) all day. The new R yksopp tracks are great.
**Triumph**: I've been sick but I took a sick day today and feel much better rested. I love actually using sick days responsibly and feeling like I am still doing well at my job!..**Struggle**: I'm really mad at people in AA. I have been reaching out to almost no avail. I know I can tend to be a negative nancy but aren't you supposed to talk about where you are at? Ugh. It's like I just naturally feel less than and not part of and then the AA social structure reinforces that idea. How do I get over this over-sensitivity? How do I not hate everyone?..**General Chat**: /r/SDBoston is up and running come check us out ')..**Meetup Note:** Met /u/RareEarthMinerals. It was cool because we had never interacted on /r/stopdrinking and now I got to know him a bit! Good times. :D
**Triumph:** My weekend was fabulous full of lots of "sobriety wins" and some personal goals achieved! Including meeintg /u/jimbeamshusband and others at the /r/sddc meetup of course. :)..**Struggle:** After reaching a big personal goal last weekend that I've been preparing for for awhile I'm feeling a bit unfocused. I need to set some new short-term goals to work towards. Also dammit I never get around to What's Up Wednesdays until Thursday!..*General chat:** Went out to a fancy dinner with some drinkers last night and we decided to split the bill equally. I decided it didn't even matter because of all the money I've already saved by not drinking. Onward and upward!
