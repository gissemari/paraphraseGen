I made it half of the year entirely sober. What. In. The. World. How freaking cool is that?..I went home for Christmas (something I couldn't afford to do for four years because I prioritized booze money over travel money) and my mom expressed how proud she is of me so many times. I didn't get tired of hearing it. My six month mark was spent at home with my family and it felt wonderful. ..Sobriety still isn't easy. I still have bad days. The only silver lining is probably the ugliest part of sobriety; with "the veil being lifted" I can't honestly feel a want to go back to my old way of living. It looks dark and ugly and awful and no matter how badly I want a drink I look at that potential life and feel nothing but depression and disgust. It doesn't look like it provides the false relief like it used to - it looks like the death of me. ..It's not easy finding relief in reality. ..However! There are real solid things that the last six months have brought me. It's not all dark and depressing. There are good days. There are good feelings. ..It's a really good feeling to know that I have the ability to get through 2019 entirely sober. There is a possibility of relapse - there always is - but I know that I *can* maintain my sobriety. ..Happy New Year SD! Thank you for being here. Eight months ago the first time I tried to quit I read this sub for hours a day. I don't think I would have made it here without you all. Here's to a beautiful year of learning and peacefulness and a daily commitment to not drinking.
