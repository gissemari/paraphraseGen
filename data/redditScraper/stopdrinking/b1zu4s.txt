Went fishing today at a city pond I was the only one there. This pond has some stone outcropping that allow you to stand and cast a bit further. As I settled in and found a spot I noticed a bottle of rich and rare whiskey. Not a foot from it was the unmistakable silver token this one was for 24 hours sober. Really jumped out at me I don't know who put it there or why but it made me think someone was trying and just gave in. I took a photo of it but don't know how to post here.  Some of you may call bs or it was staged and that's fine but for any lurkers out there. Many people struggle with this and you are not alone. Seeing that just made me sad. If anyone knows how to share the photo I will post it. Iwndwytd

My boyfriend once got a 3 month chip out of a coin machine. Pretty sad to think about it but hopefully they find their way. 
Yes I agree just a bummer to see it next to an empty bottle.
Yes that's sad... I don't need to see a photo you described it so well I have a clear picture of the scene.  Stay strong folks!   I'm not drinking with you this weekend.
Whoever drank it.Prolly feels like shit
Damn powerful image. Thanks for sharing. ..For the record the way most people seem to post images is by making an imgur account and then uploading images to it and then putting the link to the image in the text [like this.](https://imgur.com/gallery/sFpbx) IWNDWYT
Sad. And poignant.
Went to a game where you have to empty your pockets so I threw my coin in the thing and this fucking cop shouts out hey a medalion like to see that. I woulda punched that fucker if he hadn't been on the other side of security fence. Fuckstick.
