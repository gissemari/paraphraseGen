My friend asked me to go out with her last night. She asked me at 10 am. ALL day I kept making excuses for myself about why it would be okay to drink. .."You haven't been out in forever!"."You could get away with smoking if you were drinking!"."Its only one little relapse!"..And by 3 pm I had convinced myself that I was going out and drinking and that it was fine...Then by 6 pm I had convinced myself that I'd go out and not drink...Then by 7 pm I realized I'm not at a stage yet where I can go out and not drink...So I went home stayed sober  and watched queer eye.  :D ..Side note: that show is incredibly wholesome.
