And sometimes I can fake a smile and say something like "Oh I'm just not feeling well." Other times I'm afraid to open my mouth because with the lump in my throat I feel like I'm on the edge of bursting into tears... What's wrong? Everything. Nothing seems right. My wife was so furious at me two weeks ago that she wished me dead. Today she wants to act like nothing's wrong... and I can't play along. I just can't pretend like everything's ok because it's not. Last night she literally acted like nothing has ever happened even though just a week ago she literally hated me- and if not then truly the vitriol in her language was quite convincing. I know this isn't a relationship sub but I don't know if this is as much a relationship problem as it is... as much as it is "I'm an alcoholic" problem. The lines are so blurred... I'm having a real hard time and I don't know why. Not drinking was supposed to fix my problems right? Suddenly I'm not performing at work... I can't seem to do anything right. I can't think. I fucking fall apart all the time- like straight up anxiety attacks... I just... "What's wrong with me?" I'm sober and I fucking hate it. It's just too much. It hurts. It just fucking hurts. And I'm so close to the edge of "Fuck this shit" and going back to the "worthless alcoholic" that my wife told me I was- which I WAS! But at least then I know who I was and what my value was to others. I could be easily defined. This... pile of non-formable solid that I've become... "What's wrong?" I almost hate this version of myself more than I do the "worthless alcoholic" one which is ironic because even if I'm not drinking I'm still that same alcoholic just withotu the booze and struggling to find that "worth" in a life that I'm supposed to have I guess. How I'm not drinking right now I'll never know because that's what I want more than anything. Drink until I'm oblivious.....**But I will NOT have a fucking drink with you today.** I won't be happy about it but I will do what I can to distract myself and find positive sources of energy to both take in and also put out... I promise that to all of you. But right now I'm terrified that I will have to repeat today tomorrow and I don't honestly know if I want to- at all. Literally. I can't stand this person living inside me right now...Deeeeeep cleansing breath.............I've said it before... I fucking hate this. Thanks for letting me vent. Oh and happy "One Week" of sobriety to me... I guess... .

Week one is early days yet. You deserve a hearty congratulations for getting through it. There's a real enigma about using a broken brain to mend the alcoholic brain. Thing is it gets better and easier with time. Simply stopping drinking as many have posted on here will not solve all of life's problems. It sounds to me like your wife might want to forget some of the harsh things she said to you; that may or may not be healthy I'm not judging but maybe take some comfort from it because it sounds like she wants to make things work with you. Can you sit down and talk with her a bit? Being open about my problems with my husband was really difficult but I'm so glad I did it. Best wishes to you.
The first week was like that for me. I was either saying "wtfwtfwtf" in my brain or "this sucks I just want to go to bed" but like you hear so often here it **does** get better. Day by day I'm slowly crawling out of my shell and yesterday I even found myself singing along to the radio. That hasn't happened in .. years. ..Hang in there and congrats on one week! 
And to the person who responded to the post (in the 15 seconds it took my to realize I did it from the wrong account before posting it here...) I'm sorry. Just add it to the list of shit that I just don't seem to be able to do right anymore...
Hmm...I typed a comment but something went wrong...My advice is to re-build yourself. You say you identify as a "worthless alcoholic" (guess what you're more than that - I promise.) You gotta take that and put it in the past. Develop new habits new outlooks new hobbies a new identity. Who do you want to be? An alcoholic turned bodybuilder? A musician? A bookworm? A successful businessman? That's up to you to decide who to be. I'm not trying to be preachy just offering my advice and perspective. Re-create yourself into something your wife would describe as something other than a "worthless alcoholic"...not for her but for yourself. You can do it...I truly believe every single one of us here every single addict of every drug wishing to stop can build themselves a new identity worth so much more. 
A week is great news. My badge is pretty close to that. I believe that with some time effort SD and changes I can do this and you can too. I am finally willing to do whatever it takes and have had some amazing things happen the last few days largely due to my change in attitude. Not all my days are good if I stay sober but I know none of them will be if I drink. A bad day sober is better than a good day drunk is what I tell myself. I won't take a drink with you today.
Hi. I could ramble on but I came across this site on 'Rational Recovery'; https://rational.org/index.php?id=36 following another SD's user raising the topic...I'm not trying to sell anything and this is free and I found it quite useful. All you have to do is read... it goes on for quite a few pages so keep clicking next at the bottom. ..I hope it helps... it can probably be interpreted in a number of ways. Also I would just add that I was so unreasonably angry in the first three weeks or so; it's not easy but try not take it out on anyone else. Good luck man! We're all here doing it with you.
Congrats on the week that's fucking great to see that you're sticking with it. I hated the first few weeks more like month but I had to give myself time to get past the shit parts and onto the good stuff. I started to semi-enjoy being awake around two weeks sober. Hang in there bud. Keep posting and I won't drink with you today. 
..in my experience (started recovery 6 months back) people life our crazy self will all poke at us and bring us to the verge of drinking...maybe because of many years of drinking we were thick skinned and now that we are recovering even minor pinches hurt and make us want to drink and get over it...i think this is temporary while our brains re-wire..hang in there..ignore all that you have too..stay in the path...i think it gets better as i see folks with months/years in recovery...good that you vented it out and won't drink today..
