I was doing pretty well then out of no where I thought it would be okay to grab some drinks with some friends.  I'm not hung over anymore I'm just wondering how the hell I relapse after having a good amount of time.  It's starting to seem like a vicious cycle!..Whenever I feel good about the direction I'm going I end up relapsing.  I have a trip July 4 and I need to be sober and clear headed for it.  That's my initial goal for now.  Any advice will be appreciated.   ..Thanks guys!

Sorry but this doesn't happen "out of nowhere". You gave yourself permission to go out. If you feel like you're doing well and then it suddenly goes awry maybe you aren't rewarding yourself the right ways.
I know that feeling! I find the only way to make sure it doesn't happen is to be vigilant with my thoughts. The relapse happens long before you say fuck it and take the first sip. For me it helps to remind myself that my life is going in a great direction BECAUSE I'm not drinking. Feeling good can lead you into a false sense of security I think it's a similar thought process that allows people with depression to think "fuck it I don't need my meds anymore - I feel fantastic." Therefore losing sight of why they feel better in the first place. Your brain is hard wired to work against you especially in early sobriety. I went through years of what you've just described. Unfortunately it's part of the process. But it gets easier!
I have a brain that wants me to drink despite the pain it causes and a body that cant handle it.  ..I also remind myself how far I have come and keep a close eye on the choas of my past.  .Also I decided early on and keep this thought front and centre that drinking = death for me.  ..This is where it took me and whatever my head says I fight back with that.  ..Iwndwyt.
