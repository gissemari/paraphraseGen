Hey all day three and I'm not going to drink today. I did tell my wife what I'm doing and what my plans are and that I am going to need help if I'm going to stay sober for the long run. So far shes the only one who knows about my struggle and really I think she is the only one who needs to know. I'm happy she is so understanding and supportive. Happy Thursday all and I won't be drinking with you once more!

Welcome!! Great job confiding in your wife.  I didn't say anything until I made it 1 week.  It helps to have a partner!.I will not drink with you today.  Go us!
Strong work! 
Keep up the good work!!!..2 weeks and 2 days sober myself.
Happy Thursday.  Smart move telling your wife -- it helps you and makes you accountable...Today I won't drink with you!
Congrats on 3 days. That was my hardest day so far. It's already night here so I won't drink with you tonight and I won't drink with you tomorrrow. 
You might be surprised by his response. If he's a good guy he will want what is best for you. My husband pouted for about 5 minutes because we have more "fun" when I drink and he never thought I had a problem. But once I said " I drink a whole lot more than you know". He just said "oh cool then. ". Now I just have to be "fun" without alcohol. It's easier than I thought it would be. There is something about talking about your decision with people you love that gives you more determination to quit. You've got this! I won't drink with you today!!
