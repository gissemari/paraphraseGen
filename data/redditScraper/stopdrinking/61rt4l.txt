Ok... I've literally just commented on someone's post and realised as I come to the end of my own little sobriety challenge that I'm getting more and more anxious about drinking again. ..I know I don't HAVE to drink but having an end / goal to work towards has really helped me focus. I've noticed recently that I've stopped coming on here stopped actively trying to stay sober started thinking about how great it'll be in summer when I can start drinking again. ..At the same time I'm getting depressed and anxious about how all the good things that come with sobriety may disappear. I'm less anxious rarely as depressed so ridiculously fit it blows my mind (!) and life is so much easier now I'm not trying to cover up my drinking or replace stolen alcohol...In the back of my mind I know I can't moderate I've seen enough posts and drank for long enough to know it won't work like that. I guess I'm just struggling to accept that I need to stop viewing this as a short term thing...I know "one day at a time" is very helpful for many people but it doesn't work for me. So how do you stay actively sober? How did you accept a longer-term way of thinking about sobriety? ..**edit**: thanks everyone for your replies got way more than anticipated but I am definitely taking all advice on board!!!
