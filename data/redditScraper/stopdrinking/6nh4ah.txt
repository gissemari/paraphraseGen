Leaving in a few days for an extended trip to see family. It will be the first time ever that I won't be smuggling a few bottles of vodka into the house worrying I'll get caught and then smuggling out the empties (plus a bunch of empty 20oz bottles of sprite or whatever I used to mix). Not having to worry about that is a huge weight off my shoulders but at the same time.....I am DREADING this trip because as I've said before a borderline abusive relationship with these people is part of the reason I started drinking in the first place. I know we all have a chance of relapsing and I feel backed into a corner here because this would be the absolute worst setting possible to relapse in. It would be catastrophic. So not only will I be playing the tape forward every day I'm gonna have that ish on FF x 300 to the best part of the trip which is getting back on the freeway to come home and being able to say I made it through stone cold sober...My saving grace in this is that I have seen my confidence grow like the Grinch's heart over the past 20 days (which getting to 20 days never seemed possible on day 2) so I have that and some books to get through this next week. And of course the amazing people at SD. When I get back it'll be almost one month since I quit -- ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE <kevin garnett.gif>..Thanks for letting me ramble and I don't drink with you today.
