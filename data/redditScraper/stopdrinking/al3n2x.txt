I'm new to this sub and never thought I would need it. Until I got my first DUI five days ago. I would drink every night and even after a 6 pack still want a couple more. I'm usually a stay at home drinker but this one mistake opened my eyes and 5 days without a drink; I'm struggling. I've decided to admit to myself that I have a problem and I found a place close by that does meetings every day. I'm nervous but excited to start this clean chapter in my life. No more fights with the fiance over stupid things while drunk not missing taking my daughter to school because I'm hungover and too tired. Wish me luck!
