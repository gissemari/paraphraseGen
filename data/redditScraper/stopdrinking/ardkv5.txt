I am ever so thankful and grateful for 125 weeks of sobriety.  I value this more than anything in the world.  Just wishing I can get a grip on my eating habits now.  I've gained more than 100 lbs lately.

In my opinion  eating healthy and exercise make you feel better very quickly  and noticeably.  I find it easier to keep motivated. ..Hang in there.  You can do this!!
I believe you need to approach it with the same determination and conviction as quitting drinking.  I smoke cigarettes.  I have to want to quit.  There's all types of help and support to do this.  I just haven't reached and wanted to do it.  Strange how our minds work.  But I haven't given up on conquering this addiction.  Great job on 875 days!!  You'll find a way 
My wife and I switched to a plant-based diet reduced sugar and now I'm down 40lbs. I love fast-food so going plant-based really limits the scope of what I can eat when I'm not at home. The other great thing is that you can eat a lot and feel full after meals. I would highly recommend watching *Forks Over Knives* on Netflix. It's makes a very compelling argument for eliminating animal products from our diet as far as our health is concerned...
... and if vegan isn't so much your thing (see below) keto is another option. I'm down 135lbs ;-)
How fast was the weight gain? Could it be medical?
Try intermittent fastingit worked for me
