It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Struggle:** I had a tough week. An MRI showed a problem with a part of my body but I'm too superstitious to say which part. (To give you a hint it's what they call in Cockney rhyming slang the  watch and chain. ) I am waiting to hear back about how bad it is. ..Then in the meantime I got a call about the test results about ANOTHER part of my body. (To give you a hint it's one that a woman covers with her underpants.) And now I have to wait to hear back on how bad THAT is too. Gah! My first thought was  I got sober for **this? ** ..**Triumph:** Last week u/AnstyAngler made the brilliant comment that  being sober = better adulting.  When I was told about the test results after a moment of feeling bummed my second thought was of Ansty's comment. ..For me better adulting means taking better care of my health. I realized  It isn't that if I were still drinking I wouldn't have these problems. If I were still drinking I would still have them but simply would not know it because I would never have gone to get myself checked out. Instead I'd be covering the symptoms by getting drunk. ..**General:** When I was young and first moved to San Francisco I worked at a dive bar that was full of transsexuals queers drugs addicts freaks the semi-homeless and other people who had been rejected by society just like me. ..One day a drag queen put up a sign that was a prayer to Saint Dymphna the patron saint of people with mental problems. (The drag queen had done a small painting of the saint to go with it). The sign read  Dear Dymphna please pull me up short when you see me about to ruin my today by dragging all of my yesterdays and all of my tomorrows into it.  This is a prayer that I still say to this day.  .
----------immediate responses--------

It's still Tuesday here
Struggle: It's been a rough week for my health but nothing unexpected or unusual. It just sucks. It'll pass soon. Sometimes I'm tempted to drink to "escape" it but drinking would make it so much worse and that's the opposite of an escape...Triumph: I had a job interview that went really really really well. I know I'll probably jinx it or something but I've really got my hopes up this time. I've still got a couple steps left in the interview process but they'll give me a schedule by the end of the week.
Struggle: I'm not doing so good at this moment Anxiety is at very high right now I sometimes feel like I am at my breaking point just sitting here in a cold sweat wanting to drink so bad...Triumph: I just have to do one day at a time one minute at a time if i have to and eventually get out of these horrendous early-sobriety days. My counselor will be very please to hear from me that I've still maintained sobriety.  
Whaddup hump day!..Struggle: currently working full time studying part time postgrad and attempting to maintain my important relationships while working my personal recovery program which involves lots of time on here as well as daily exercise and eating lots of wholesome home-cooked food. I'm really busy so time management is a struggle right now. But to be honest it's a triumph too - because somehow I'm managing to juggle it all. ..Triumph: I'm managing my stress levels better than ever. This week I've achieved some great things and am still feeling well-rested and positive...It's just remarkable. I'm used to being a cranky old shit of a person. I'm used to feeling negative and worried and as though the world is always asking more of me than I can handle...I don't feel like that at all right now. I feel light and capable. There's a lot on my proverbial plate sure - but I put it all there. I made choices that brought me here. I've been on this recovery roundabout for a few years now and this week I feel like all the little bits I've learned are clicking into place. This is manageable...It's not just manageable it's desirable. I'm not only capable of remaining sober - I actually WANT to. I don't know what's changed this time but I'm clinging to it for dear life.
Happy Hump Day!...**STRUGGLE** I'm having little discomfort in my belly are. It alternates between left and right side. So Now I'm panicking that my liver and pancreas are acting up. Last month had a blood work and ...Glucose Serum is elevated (103) but ALT and AST are 21. So it is good. Right?...Going to see my doc on Thursday so I will ask....Nobody knows. Nobody knows that I have a problem. Except for few strangers in IOP I attended last year. I'm doing this by myself with the help from all of you. Even this account was created so I can come here and my kids who know my public handle on Reddit won't find out. ...I'm lazy. Seriously lazy. I would rather spent all day on my computer that do anything productive. Last few days I didn't even feel like cooking and I love to cook. ...Smoking needs to go....**Triumph** I feel like I've never spent the past decade as a Bacchus's mistress. Drinking doesn't cross my mind at all. Very strange but I'm not complaining.  ...**General** I love sunflowers. Last year I planted gazillion seeds and only one survived. Squirrels bunnies chipmunks ate all the seedlings. ...No idea what to do this year. But I want sunflowers in my garden. Maybe if I plant few pounds of seeds few more will make it....You guys are such an amazing bunch of people. Whenever I come here and read about the struggles. How hard everybody is fighting. Successes and temporary setbacks. Hell I have no words to describe my feelings....God speed to all of us. .
**T:** Went on a trip to the American Southwest.  It was grueling.  I didn't drink and that's huge.  I'm not going to lie I thought about drinking but I didn't really have any cravings.  There were some thoughts about I could just drink and then get back to not drinking when I get back home.  But I identified it as a thought not a truth...**S(s):**  Still trying to get back into the swing of things from my trip.  I've been back for 48 hours and my house isn't as good as shape as I thought I'd left it in...I left the dog with my daughter and her mom when I went on my trip and they didn't give her her meds.  I don't really blame my daughter that much because well she's a kid so I'll cut her some slack but my ex wtf it's her damn dog...I got my daughter back with fleas.  Total wtf and I'm certain that the dog has also got fleas.  I haven't found any on her (dog) but that doesn't mean they aren't there.  ..School.  Failing.  Not cool...So yeah failing school flea bites on daughter dog in worse shape than before...And for the cherry on top I lost my stethoscope...**G:**  "I got sober for this?"  I had this idea that if I got sober my life would just magically be perfect and wonderful.  Hahaha.  No.  Didn't work out like that.  But now I can handle more shit.  Failing school?  Whatever.  Dog has fleas?  Been there done that.  House is a mess?  Nothing new with that.  Child has fleas... hmmm.  That's a new one.  I didn't know that children could get fleas.  And stethoscope I had the foresight to get a cheap ass stethoscope because I had a hunch I'd lose it at some point.  Dymphna never heard of that one.  I think I've found my Saint..
I know this is not entirely on topic and I hope this doesn't get deleted  but I am so often struck by this when I read your posts -..You are so  so good at this.  Like  I don't know if posting on SD counts as a talent or a skill or whatever  but you are just really good at it. It's not just that you're consistent but you're super insightful and just helpful. I think it's a saturated field  and I imagine you have a million other things going on  but I feel you would make a good counselor.  ..Anyhoooooz my point here is how you were considered "outcast" or "fringe" or whatever.  I wonder how many extremely talented people who have been missed/ignored due to being different?
**Struggle**: Please help me through to a B in Calculus. Also please give me the strength to stick to my calorie deficit so I can go sub 13% body fat for my cousins wedding in May. I just bought a well fitted suit that is going to look absolutely shit hot with a fitted shirt and maybe a bowtie. Goal is to nail a bridesmaid but since I am not acquainted with anyone it'll be an uphill climb for sure. ..**Triumph**: 91 on my last calculus test seeing a new therapist who is really friendly and funny. Also three dates lined up for this weekend..with three different women lol. got in a good workout this morning donated blood this afternoon. Apparently I have this rare protein as well on top of being o negative. Going to lift tomorrow so I am excited for that.  ..**General**: life is busy and sometimes I want it to slow down a little bit but whatever. I am having fun right now and ready to finish school so I can get a kickass job making some grown up money. I just want to look good feel healthy make money and have fun in life. 
**Struggle:**  This weekend was fairly rough with a really really busy night at the bar where I work plus an overnight inventory followed by a 3 hour drive for Easter dinner with family without sleep.  I knew this was all going to happen so my obvious coping mechanism was to drink to oblivion the whole week prior. I ended up having minor withdrawal symptoms (hallucinations lack of appetite insomnia) for most of the weekend.  Now I want to eat all the things!..**Triumph:** I fought through the insomnia and withdrawal and made an effort to enjoy my time and its clear that my relationships in family are getting better. It's also become quite clear that for several years I've had withdrawal symptoms not just hangovers as I'd originally thought. All the more reason to keep staying sober.  My first visit with a new PCP comes up in a week. Very excited!..**General:** I feel a need to volunteer. Looking at options at the Children's Hospital nearby.
**Struggle**: My partner is going through a severe depression and I feel helpless. He is also struggling with physical health issues. I just don't know what to do other than empathize and try and be extra Manic Pixie Dream Girl when he's really down to make him see the beauty in life again or whatever. I won't lie though part of me also wants to see him make changes and put in the work. Trying to be supportive but also throw down tough love as needed. I struggle with depression too. ..**Triumph** I LOVE MY NEW JOB AND I AM KICKING ASS AT IT how is this my life...**General** The ups and downs of life feel less extreme now. I know I am able to handle anything that comes my way. Being sober really does equal better adulting and who knew adulting could be so much fun?
I sincerely hope your medical issues end up ok. Thank you for sharing. ..I'm off to bed I made it through day 4. I feel like I'm on my way to clearer thoughts and better decisions. I'm definitely not totally there yet but I think it's getting a little bit easier each day. ..My wife is excited and I had an awesome revelation that I shared with her today: I'm pretty sure we will save about $200-$250 per month. That's money that I won't spend at the bars and liquor stores etc...Thanks to everyone in the SD sub. This is a great support system. IWNDWYT!
Struggle: I've been feeling blah and I've been acting blah. I feel bored and annoyed with myself. I'm lonely. I'm watching too much TV and not exercising. I am really tired of the cold weather...Triumph: I've been getting some practical things done. I've saved money. I've stayed sober...General: I think I just need some more structure in my life. Planning. I need to work more. I did have some plans today but then the dental appointment this morning left me with pain and headaches all day...Anyway iwndwyt 
Wow Mary.  I feel like we are swinging in sync:  I'm dealing with scans  up north and south this month too.  That's eerie.  It's not fun but as you say it's better to know what's what than to just cover it up.  I'm sorry you're going through this.  I know you already have too much on your plate medically.  No fair!..*Triumph:* As you kindly mentioned: adulting.  This is still my triumph this week.  I made appointments for myself my dog my kid. Paid bills went to work fixed the kid's bike cleaned the house etc.  One thing I've learned is a "boring" life does not equal easy.  Domestic life takes a fuck ton of work...*Struggle:* I found out I need a surgery that I can't afford.  That made me want to cry.  The good news is that this is not life threatening just painful and I can put it off for a bit.  But my body is a money pit now.  Yay...*General:* I like the motto of living today and keeping the yesterdays and the tomorrows at arms length.  All too often I am caught up in my scheming and dreaming trying to fix problems many of which don't even exist yet.  Sheesh. 
Struggle::  I'm in the same boat healthwise as many of you mentioned . I actually got a certified letter from my Doctors office today  due to missing appointments last week while on my two week bender . I left my job and only have insurance for 1 more month .                                               Triump;;:  I have appointments lined up now and I'm feeling much better after the 3 days of withdrawls . And that's a really great Doctor I have huh??                      I hope everything works out for everyone here !!'
**Struggle:** I m kind of down &amp; out these weeks with heart suddenly racing head spinning fatigue; it doesn t feel like anxiety or panic attacks but it does look like it rolling in and out at random and it certainly messes me up every single day stopping me from doing what I want and need to do. It s exhausting like the fat bully from school kicking your foot every time you try to get up. ..**Triumph:** I ve taken half a step in following my dream. It s way more than no step...**General:** Whenever I feel the odds are against me I think about [Dumb and Dumber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX5jNnDMfxA). Pure gold.
Struggle: having some serious money troubles at the moment. I'm hoping someone will employ me sooner rather than later otherwise I'm not sure how I'm going to manage.....Triumph: if I remember correctly I believe today marks 2 whole months sober which feels massive. I can't believe I've gotten this far!..(Extra triumph cos I'm super proud of myself.... I've lost 8kg since December and can fit in all my clothes again! I've been hitting the gym and am starting to feel strong physically for the first time in years.)..IWNDWYT..You are all wonderful people I'm proud of you no matter where you're at today   
Struggle: worked a 24 hour shift on Easter. Realized one of the many (unhealthy) reasons I drank was to deal with loneliness and frustration of being a single parent and missing out on a lot. Usually have Monday and Tuesday to recover from 24 hour shift but this week both of my little kids have strep throat and ear infections- so no school/ pre-school. Now it's 4:00 am and I can't sleep and I have to work until 8:00 tonight.   Oh and did I mention we are moving?..Triumph: I made it through yesterday. ..General: Shit happens. I don't drink.
**Struggle** It's my first dinner and drinks to meet my new work team tonight - first time meeting. I haven't been around booze since I stopped last Monday so this makes me really anxious. I'm hoping for some other non-drinkers there...**Triumph** I've been to two yoga classes in the past week and they've been so so fantastic at helping with my anxiety. I'm starting to feel more grounded. ..**General** I didn't know how much grunting would be at said yoga session particularly old-man-grunting. Made me giggle but then also realise that people were just there to chill and get zen and not worry about other people. I ended up letting out a few grunts of my own. 
**Struggle:** I know I'm only a few days in but sobriety is going fine. I can't stop craving cigarettes though! And because I don't want to smoke I end up fixing the craving with cake. It's a good thing I work on a university campus where no tobacco products are sold otherwise I wouldn't be able to go into a shop...**Triumph:** I'm sticking to my goals of sobriety and posting here. I've been into a pub and was fine ordering a wine for my wife and a diet coke for me. Baby steps but I am going to try and make it to my regular Thursday night meet up (which happens in a pub). The people I meet won't give a shit if I don't drink it's more a test for me. I'm resolved to leave if I find it difficult though...**General:** I've been reading [The Second Coming by Yeats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Second_Coming_\(poem\)) repeatedly over the past few days. The imagery in the first stanza in particular sums up for me the experience of being trapped by alcohol (I know the poem isn't about that but you know death of the author and all that). Also the idea that 'some revelation is at hand' is powerful because in this particular reading it applies to  the drinker who is chasing a fleeting revelation and to the person who has chosen to stop - both behaviours manifest in the hope of something new. The sinister image of the 'rough beast' that 'slouches towards bethlehem to be born' may fit the idea of the cycle repeating but I think it can also be read hopefully as it is posed as a question 'What rough beast...'; the nature of it is undetermined and can be controlled. ..Much of the above can be summarised with 'I think it's a fascinating poem and you may enjoy reading it'.
I can't imagine how nerve wracking waiting on those results must be Mary. Keeping you in my thoughts and hoping for a good outcome. ..**Struggle:** My husband is traveling for work this week and it's the first time I've really been alone for more than an evening since I quit drinking. Alone time drinking used to be my absolute favorite time to drink. It's been a while since I've had to fight the "grab a 12 pack after work" urges. ..**Triumph:** There's nobody around to know if I drank or not and I'm getting through it just fine! When I get home from work in the evening I keep myself busy by cooking nice dinners cleaning around the house reading here on SD. The kinds of things I did in early sobriety still work for me now :) ..**General:** I got a plot in our community garden again this year I was pretty happy about that because I procrastinated on getting the application in and thought I was going to miss out on it. Now if only the weather would warm up so I can get to planting..
Struggle: I'm still having post concussive symptoms. I'm exhausted from waking up through the night with spins. I'm really sensitive to stress as it makes the vertigo and headaches stronger. ..Triumph: I seem to be much less moody and I'm feeling more positive than I have in a long time. And the extra perk of that is people are treating me better when I treat them better. I guess that should be common sense but it's always been hard to be nice to people and give them a break. ..General: It's becoming more evident that I was much more self-absorbed when I drank. The world is bigger than me and just because some things about the world really sucks doesn't mean I have to be an asshole. 
Struggle: working in an environment where everyone drinks and love to talk about it specially when the day had been extra stressful. ..Triumph: staying sober. I'm impress that I'm in control over my alcoholism. ..General: I think I figure out how to channel my stress away. Working out!!! I hope this works. 
Struggle: just no sleep last night.  I mean just tossed and turned and was sweating and ugh.  Watched the clock run through the hours and hugged my dog a lot.  I'm going to guess it's a part of the detox experience.  I've been training a lot and my body is throwing the bad stuff out.  This is only Day 3 and I've been here before...we'll see what happens next Wednesday..Triumph: Muay Thai yesterday with my amazing sober friends.  Dentist today with my amazing sober teeth.  Hah!.General: I agree with the idea of sobriety = taking care of ourselves.  So easy to blow everything off get a pack of smokes and then hit the bar.  No more cigarettes no more alcohol no more toxic crud going in..IWNDWYT
Good morning Mary. I'm so sorry about those test results. Like you say it's good that at least you are being made aware so that you can do something about any problems that are trying to crop up in your body. Scary though I know. ..**Struggle** I've had some sort of nasty stomach bug. I was feeling better yesterday and did fine going to work but had no energy for my usual activities for Tuesday like walking my dog and going to yoga. Also I ate a big spicy dinner last night and am realizing now that was really really dumb. My belly wasn't ready for that and it's letting me know today how angry it is. It's going to be a long day and I teach aerobics tonight at the gym which is nerve wracking when you aren't feeling 100%. ..**Triumph** I got my AFAA Group Fitness Instructor certification last Friday! I passed the exam. There aren't many gyms in my area but I'm hoping to find somewhere (at least one other in addition to the one I teach at now) to teach at for the summer. Teaching classes keeps me very focused on staying active and working on my personal fitness and I think if I do say so myself I have a way of making it more fun for others to work out. ..**General** I'm going to really appreciate Spring if it ever arrives. It is 1 out here in Central MN this morning. That's Fahrenheit!!!
Still here! ..Struggles- I've just started so pretty much everything is a struggle. I've not been further than a mile from my house since I stopped in fear I might slip. Hoping to get somewhere with my son tomorrow...Triumph- Actually deciding to stop and managing to keep going for 5 days...General- My dog really smells bad today I wonder if she's been like this for a while and my sense of smell and taste were dulled. I hope not! Would be quite embarrassing. Bathtime doggo!
Day three sober - woke up early (had to take two melatonin to help sleep) but felt REVIVED biked to a cafe got a bit of work done now making lunch and feel surprisingly good! IWNDWYT!!
Mary I have you in my thoughts... will say an extra prayer to my favourite Saint when it comes to women facing struggles xxxx ..Speaking of struggle: my big one this week is the behaviour of a close friend [though perhaps they won't be for much longer] who has lost all sense of boundaries in terms of trying to direct me and my life. Case in point this week she has been kinda stalking my house and in particular my dog in the yard out of some strange idea that their feelings about my dog matter more than accepted social conventions. Their behaviour has also really wierded out Kiddo because has been seeing it out her bedroom window very early in the mornings. I am still working out how I plan to handle it as the situation is extremely sensitive. oh small towns the joy...Triumph: I am getting a whole lot better at working out which fucks to give instead of giving a fuck about every single niggling thing. This is saving me a lot of stress and angst...General: adulting has very much been on my mind. I am feeling pleased that when I "put on my big girl panties" [as the saying goes] they fit better. That includes the actual ones also FWIW ;).
What's up SD! Happy Wednesday...Struggle: I've got a big thing at work that is totally stressing me out and exhausting me. It's taking up 8+ hours of every day on top of normal work and life and it won't be over until 6 weeks from now. Managing it is difficult but I'm working on it. ..Triumph: Since my most recent dalliance with beer I've put on about 10 pounds. Sobering up had only switched over my cravings to sugar and the weight gain had slowed but not stopped. I think I've finally turned a corner stopped the gain and I'm slowly going the other way. ..General: Yesterday's meditation had these nice thoughts regarding feeling a melancholy nostalgia for times in your past. Life is made of a collection of moments that are not ours to keep. Enjoy your sweet memories; it's okay to mourn their loss. But be sure to open to the present as best you can and step forward. This is where new memories are born...Have a great day everybody! IWNDWYT
Struggle: husband and I are moving across the country from New England to Colorado and he leaves today (I leave in May). Packing was very stressful this week. I'm not looking forward to saying goodbye to my husband for 2 months...Triumph: the stress of moving really made me want to drink. Since quitting almost 2 months ago I haven't had such a huge desire to drink than this past week. But I didn't!! I stayed strong and did not drink and I'm so proud of myself for doing that.
Struggle: Some serious medical issues in the family and taking on more of a caretaker role. Learning a lot about what brain surgery rehab looks like. ..Triumph: Being sober for all of this. I couldn't balance this new role with my career if I was still drinking. I have also been more intentional about taking time for self-care even if it's just a half hour. 
**Struggle**: Lent is over.  Spouse is back to drinking and I'm starting to think I could do that too but I don't really want to...**Triumph**: I donated blood yesterday!  It was too high the last time I tried but this time my blood pressure was *just* low enough - I probably need to go to my GP about that because it's *always* been borderline high.  140/92... at 29.  Yikes.  I have another twenty pounds to lose and maybe that'll help but I might need medication to keep it in check...**General**: Just trying to remember what I like about being sober at night and alert in the mornings.  This *is* better than the alternative but sometimes I forget that.
Hola!.I'm still feeling the pain from this weekend..But I will not drink with you today!
Struggle: trying to not let every little irritating   thing be a trigger for me..Triumph: I did my 20 minute walk everyday like I promised myself . .General: it is actually hump day for me I don't have to work this weekend. IWNDWYT! 
Hi everyone!
hey everybody! IWNDWYT!
Struggle: I've been on a bit of an emotional roller coaster this last week. I know it's just my mood fluctuating because I'm still in early sobriety but damn I wish these bouts of sadness would stop. They always end up passing and when I get in a funk I usually go to a meeting and come out feeling much better but I'm ready for my to be a little more stable. ..Triumph: I'm a month out from the semester being over and I've got really good grades right now. In the past I would've either stopped going to class by this point or I would have missed so many days an A or B wouldn't even be possible in any of my classes. I'm glad I'm keeping the course and it looks like I'm going to finish the semester strong. ..General: I found a Bell and Howell Zoomatic 8mm movie camera at an antique store that still works for 12 bucks so I'm pretty stoked about that. I also was just gifted a Nikon FE 35mm film camera so I'm pretty excited to get out there and shoot some movies/photos with my new toys! ..Have a good day SD fam!
**Triumph:** I figured out how to keep my diet under control for a week and the results speak for themselves. I've crept over my plateau at long long last and I should be going steady for the next few weeks...**Struggle:** I didn't end up adopting my cat yet :(  She ran off shortly after I showed up to meet her got in a spat with the old cat who doesn't like her and hid upstairs and wouldn't come down. I got to meet her kittens though who are very cute (but a little young for me)! We're trying again next week...**General:** I've been wanting to get a bit of art for my apartment. Nothing's really inspired me yet but it'd be nice to have a cool painting photograph or vintage national park poster or movie poster on my wall.
Struggle:.Work project is kicking my ass. ...Triumph:.Started keto last week and I've stuck to it fairly well as far as I can tell. Also have cut out diet soda completely. ...General:.The spring weather has drastically improved my mood and outlook. 
I really like u/sfgirlmary's story from San Francisco. It's so easy to "ruin my today by dragging all of my yesterdays and all of my tomorrows into it". I caught myself doing just that: instead of being happy last evening that I had a productive day at work and a relaxed evening ahead I was stressing out over the X number of things I have to do these upcoming weeks and felt bad for not having taken care of Z number of things last weekend and so on. Why? Why do this? Time does not stop flowing. Can't go back so why feel so bad about last week? Can't teleport to the future to get there faster either. So might as well be present enjoy life in front of me right now. Thanks for sharing that story u/sfgirlmary! ..On a side note: 2 weeks down! Wohoo!
Hey Mary - I'm thinking of you praying for you and will be in touch shortly...**Struggle:**     I'm sitting here with Mom who just got out of surgery. While surgery went well she may be losing another toe (background: had a leg and 2 toes amputated already). ..It FUCKING SUCKS that I can't even talk to my sister about this stuff because she took over Mom's life and left us like this...**Triumph:**     I'm still here sober and able to take care of Mom...**Triumph II:**     The universe works in VERY mysterious ways. .Since I got here a few hours ago I've already gotten 2 possible clients for my new job!!! These 2 doctors are wonderful people and I'm hoping for the best...**General:**     K called me last night and said I sound awful - exhausted and out of it. I told him I've been up for 3 nights with Mom hallucinating (thinking there are people in the room with her at midnight). I'm going to treat myself and actually get a few hours sleep this afternoon. Gotta put my own oxygen mask on first! (Right u/Possibilitarian2015?!) &lt;3
Struggle: not having much support form my closest friends and family IRL. ..Triumph: 2 weeks mark hit today :-)..General: getting a lot of ideas and support from being here on SD. Thank you all!
Struggle: still fighting this terrible cold usual go to would be to drink to numb myself ..Triumph: I have not drank to numb myself! Going to the store now to get some power juice and mucinex ..General: haven't been going to the bathroom every day the past few days. I can't tell if it's from being sick or if this is normal day 10 stuff? 
[removed]
Struggle: once the shame and anxiety started to wear off I actually found myself thinking things like  I can have just one...  but deep down I know myself and know why I decided to stop drinking and it's almost been a full week now. Just taking it one day at a time. Also I haven't really told anyone what's going on other than my so and brother so everyone at Easter dinner kept offering me drinks. So that's a conversation that'll have to happen. .Triumph: It's almost been one full week!
This is my first post. I've been lurking for a week now and find myself checking in every day...Struggle: Next Thursday I'm hosting a neighborhood Bunko (aka "Drunko"--we don't actually play anything). I'm obsessed with thinking about how I'm going to make it through without drinking. Unfortunately I planned this before I decided to stop drinking so I also scheduled a boozy brunch the following Saturday. It was supposed to be a long-weekend of wine indulgence--guilt-free because I had these parties to host. ..Triumph: I've been getting up at 5:30 each morning and getting out for my run even in the rain. I downloaded Annie Grace's The Naked Mind and have been listening to it while I run. It's like starting my day with my own personal recovery meeting...General: I'm just really excited that this group exists. I'd love to hear about any other online resources you all find helpful.
Found out that my ex had cheated on me. Rough but it just gives me more motivation to stay sober  I was always getting drunk with her. Dont think I couldve quit if we stayed together.
Struggle:   I got dumped.     Reminding my of why I stopped doing the whole monogamy thing.      ..Triumph : I want tempted to drink.    It didn't even cross my mind until i was about to go to bed and I noticed that drinking didn't even occur to me as an option.  ...General :   planning a trip that I'm very excited about.    Making progress on my finances.  My beer gut is getting noticeably smaller.   The bags under my eyes are no longer considered check luggage.    Over all feeling good.     
Struggle: I have a wedding coming up and all my childhood friends will be there. They were also the people I started drinking and using drugs with. And they are all either drunks or hard drug abusers now. I'm not afraid of not drinking at the wedding. That'll be relatively easy but I'm worried about the drugs that'll be floating around at the wedding; coke meth and dope. I'm already trying to rationalize using dope or coke again with them because "my main problem was always alcohol" and a "few lines wouldn't hurt."..Struggle 2: My liver pains are coming back with vengeance at two months sober and that is absolutely terrifying....Triumph: I've decided to go back to school and finish my BA. Hopefully going to go for my Master's degree as well.
**Triumph:** Been productive at work and knocking tasks off the list. Running feels good and since I'm just over a month out from my first event of the year that's a very nice feeling...**Struggle:** Some of my work productivity is procrastination on a big project. I'm burned out lacking motivation and keep putting progress off. Not a nice feeling...**General:** Thanks for letting me know about [St Dymfna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dymphna)!
**Struggle:** I can't seem to get past day 2. This has been an ongoing problem for me where I don't drink for a night and then on the 2nd or 3rd night I end up rushing off to the store at 8pm to grab a few. I'm scared for tonight...**Triumph:** Just an hour ago I passed up the liquor store while doing errands. I thought about it for sure but I made it by without stopping. Thank God...**General:** This has inspired me today so I thought i would share .*"It is not the critic who counts: not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs and comes up short again and again because there is no effort without error or shortcoming but who knows the great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself for a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least he fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat.".~Theodore Roosevelt*
Struggle: I found out my good friend has the same type of cancer that my grandma had years ago. She seems calm about it and she says the outlook is positive so I'm hoping she's right and I'm praying for her! It really puts my own struggles into perspective...Triumph: I told my dad about SD a week ago and he called today to tell me he's 5 days sober! This means the world to me since part of me going sober was because I didn't want to end up like him... alcohol is super normalized in my family and I'm super proud of both of us :)..General: "You don't fail until you stop trying"
struggle: missing someone that does not deserve my attention..triumph: survived my move..general: i am excited for my new place
Struggle: there seems to be beer everywhere I go..Triumph: I've still somehow almost made it a week. Thanks in enormous part to all of you..General: I've noticed I'm eating more (no longer consuming so many empty calories &amp; carbs?) but eating healthier (nourishing calories &amp; complex carbs!)
Struggle: I just came off a pretty rough relapse last weekend after a period of 45 days sober - ended up in the hospital had the parents and girlfriend extremely worried all that. Have been in a bit of a funk since it happened and its looking like I might need to take the semester off while I deal with mental health concerns and my drinking...Triumph: Despite being a lurker on this sub for a while I decided it's finally time to actually join and become a part of the community. I'm certainly recommitted to my sobriety and I think taking the semester off might give me the chance to make my sobriety a priority over anything else...General: My girlfriend (who is pretty recent we've only been together for a month but we're very close) just made a playlist for me after me being in the hospital. I've never actually had someone make a playlist for me and it made me really happy for some reason. I dunno it was a good feeling. 
Struggle: Now that my hangover is gone from last weekend I keep almost slipping into the whole  well do I REALLY have a  problem?  trap. Also I'm trying to focus on one thing right now so I'm letting myself eat whatever and how much of whatever I want. Although I know it's good idea in order to stay away from drinking I can't help from feeling a little shame about eating what I know is way more than I need. ..Triumphs: I'm reading The Naked Mind by Annie Grace and it's amazing motivation. It made me feel almost stupid when she pointed out that alcohol is the only substance where we blame the user for not being able to  handle  it. There's no such thing as a heroine-aholic! Heroine is addictive and the expectation is that a user will become addicted. Seems so  duh  and obvious now. Anyway it's been a great support this first week. Also very happy I found this sub! It's kind of incredible that I found a place where many many people are kind and compassionate to each other via the internet. I haven't read one piece of negativity and that alone is incredible. ..General: I've been thinking about a conversation I had with a friend about how Ive decided not to drink because I now know100% that I can not control my intake once I start. It was an overall solid discussion where she was saying her habit was more like one or two everyday but rarely binging she admitted this was probably also harmful. What I can't stop thinking about though was she compared what I was describing to her relationship with chocolate. I found it interesting that she equated the dangers of binging on chocolate to binging on alcohol. Maybe she meant only the pattern or maybe it was another example of how alcohol is just not considered as dangerous and toxic as it is...who knows! ..
Thank you /u/sfgirlmary for the inspiring words. I read this post on my bus to work this morning and it was a great start to the day :) Here goes nothin......Struggle: Currently my struggle is my career. I walked away from a high stress but very prestigious position a few months ago. Partially because I fucked up and because I couldn't handle it and I was being bullied by a manager... I just snapped. Now I'm realizing some of these problems were probably related to the heavy drinking in this establishment. Everyone drank non-stop myself included. I still struggle with the loss of this job. I made it my life: I worked so hard for so long to get there and sacrificed so much. My friends were all working there or so I thought. No one there has reached out to me since but I'm ok with that. For a while after leaving this job I would get wasted stare in the mirror with hate and sob telling myself I failed and was worthless. I thought my dreams were crushed and my friends were all illusions. I could barely leave the house. I took some time off and got a great new job with zero alcohol on the premises. I still struggle there because my confidence became nothing after this experience but I'm working on building it back up again....Triumph: Deep down I know I am good at what I do. I feel appreciated at my new place of work. I love how organized and well-run it is. I enjoy the day-to-day tasks friendly encounters and my hours now line up with my husbands. We get to spend so much time together and I love it! I feel like my partner and I are rebuilding our life and kicking ass. We recently moved into a much better apartment and it's so clean and cozy. Life is ok :)...General: Been working on a musical collaboration for years that is almost complete. The artists working on this (myself included) have been suffering from so many issues- substance abuse depression domestic violence poverty death in the family illness you name it. It was like our creation was never meant to see the light of day. Well it will finally be complete at the end of April! Hard work will eventually pay off and I believe our finished product will be a testament to our suffering- better because of it. ...Thanks if anyone took the time to read this it was so comforting to actually type it out. IWNDWYT!...
