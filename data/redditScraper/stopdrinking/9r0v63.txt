It's amazing how far a relapse will set you back. I'm still feeling physically sick  and anxious. Called in sick from work today because of it. The reprocussions just keep reverberating. I thought today would be a way better day. It's not. My mental health is just destroyed at this point. I'm so depressed. So sick. I feel like it has to be this bad to get me this down so that I don't want to drink again. Will this time be different? It has to be. This is not me. This is not how I want to lead my life. Man I'm just so so so down. I'm going to do some research on meditation today. I'm going to talk to my higher power a lot today. Things will get better right? I CAN NOT feel like this ever again. Rock bottom right here. This is it. It's horrible and horrific and sad. IWNDWYT

Time to stop digging in this rabbit hole. We can claw our way back to a better life. We have to do this. One day at a time. IWNDWYT.
