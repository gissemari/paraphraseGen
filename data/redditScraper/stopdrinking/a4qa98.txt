So today is my 1 year soberversary.   Can't believe it.  It's been a whirlwind of a year.  Had a lovely dinner out with my family watch a film at home and now heading to bed for a good sleep.  Hard to believe how things have changed in 1 year. ..This time last year I was a wreck. Marriage on the rocks.  A shadow of the person I was and am becoming again.    Not much has actually Changed in my life ie same job house car etc. But my mind is clear and content and I'm a much happier person.  ..Good luck to anyone who is struggling out there. It's worth the struggle!

Funny. We can drink whenever we want and I've yet to see anybody here say "I went sober for X amount of time but I can't wait to drink again!"
Congrats btw.

Huge congrats - I'm counting the days for mine. I get to celebrate one year of sobriety on NYE! Should be ironic. :)
