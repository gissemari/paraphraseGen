Good morning/ afternoon.   .Theme: Give yourself a break.   .**"Have patience with all things but chiefly have patience with yourself. Do not lose courage in considering your own imperfections but instantly set about remedying them -- every day begin the task anew."-Saint Francis de Sales**    .What I get from it: sometimes it is overwhelming to think of my struggles and imperfections but if I just chip away one thing at a time it becomes far more manageable.

This is one of the good ways I trudge the road of happy destiny. Now I'm all pumped up--I wish I read this in the morning. :)
This is exactly what I needed to hear! I reached out to so many women to varying degrees of success that I have been thinking *fuck it.* Patience courage setting about remedying them... "Every day begin the task anew.*...... *Okay.* Thanks universe
