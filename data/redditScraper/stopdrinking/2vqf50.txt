I have always been impulsive. Always. I do things without consequence I barely reign myself in. ..I feel like I drank that way too and I feel like now without alcohol it's EVEN worse. Wth?! I thought it would subside because I am not drunk or irritable so my will strength will be better. It's not...Why? ..Also I keep fucking dreaming that I drank. I feel guilty of course... but I keep dreaming that I have the intention to get wasted but I only end up having one drink. Time will pass in my dream and I will see that I have alcohol left over. What the hell is with that?! (I have been struggling with the thoughts that I *did* have moderation when I took breaks but when I didn't 'abstain' for a significant period I kept slipping. ..I didn't drink to get drunk until much later in my drinking career. When things were bad I could go to a dinner and have one or two no problem. I enjoyed the taste of different types of wines scotchs whiskey and rums. I tasted sipped and I could go somewhere and have only one and not be obsessed with the idea of more. It just seemed that when things were out of hand where when I felt lost and scared. ..I wanted to get to the core of why I drank so much or felt J was getting to the point of *needing* it that I could quit while I was ahead. ..I feel like if I gave my body a good old break (I'm talking a year or more) I could go back to moderation. I think that's where my dreams come from...*sigh*

I can honestly say I've never been able to wrap my mind around "not drinking too get drunk." The first time I drank after my years of drug abuse it was with the sole purpose to get drunk and always was since then. Guess that's why I had to stop.
