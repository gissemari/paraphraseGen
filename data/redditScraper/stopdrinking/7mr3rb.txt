I'm watching my dog chewing on her Christmas dog toy. It's a reindeer with a plastic bottle inside. She knows the bottle comes out as she has gotten it out once before. She tries day after day to get that bottle out. Chewing and shaking and pulling. I think if she only had thumbs she could get the bottle right out and be so happy! ..Watching her determination to defeat the bottle toy makes me think of my determination to keep the bottle out of my life. I try every day and some days it is tough. But if I keep trying like doggo does with her toy one day it will be easier. One day she will destroy that cotton cover and get the bottle free. One day I will feel free of the chains of the struggle...Like my doggo if I keep fighting to keep the bottle out some day it will be out of my life. I know the struggle will get easier. I'm growing my sobriety thumbs every day I don't drink. IWNDWYT

I will not drink with you!
It sounds like you've been drinking?
The chains get a little looser lighter every day. Every day isn't easy but they start to add up. Doggo knows the secret-keep at it and you will be rewarded! Great sobriety work. IWNDWYT.
