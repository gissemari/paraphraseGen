What can I say guys after countless and I mean COUNTLESS failures I've nearly tied my first trinity of weeks together. After my last relapse after constantly feeling indestructible when I'd been drinking something changed in my body and brain. I had been on a very heavy night out and drunk something ridiculous like 15 large beers (disgusting thing is it may have been more) I didn't really feel hungover in the slightest but my body felt physically broken...No headache no nausea but my insides were on fire I was legit scared.  I knew this could genuinely not continue now no excuses I don't care how bad the withdrawals are I cannot live like this anymore. When I don't drink I want to and can do amazing things when I drink I can't do any of that. ..I mainly drank and used drugs like many people to cope with mental trauma from a pretty grim and depressing past. I saw a picture today that said "Drugs will take away your pain at first then they'll stop working and will instead take away your job your house your family and friends your sanity until all you're left with is the pain you were trying to escape at first."..I needed something to save me and thankfully those things have come in the form of a great support group which is you guys my SO my new job and you guys will be sick of hearing about it this rate lol but being a pending dad. I have responsibilities now and a reason to continue. ..I've done this for my friends  my family you guys my soon to be family but most importantly for myself. This streak of constant failures has finally been stopped by the one right path I've finally taken in life now. IWNDWYT
