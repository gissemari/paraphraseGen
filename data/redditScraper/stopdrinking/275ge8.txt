Just about done with the day after anxiety crap. I'm truly excited to not drink tomorrow. I'm excited to be a better dad and husband. I'm excited to have a lemonade instead of a drink at BBQ's. I'm excited to not hide pints of bourbon in my house so I can take a swig when we I want. Just thought I'd let all of you know. Your stories and struggles are inspirational. It's like having an AA meeting on my phone.

Fair play to you. This sub is great working in tandem with meetings.  Enjoy the journey.
Good stuff. ..By the way lemonade is a "drink" :)..Drinking existed before booze :p
Good on you for starting your journey with a positive attitude. It makes the trip a whole lot more pleasant that's for sure. ..A note to the hidden bottles: I was still finding lost bottles several months down the road. They served as reminders of the life that I did not want ever ever again. ..I'm glad you've taken the opportunity to read everyone's stories here. I probably spent at least a solid two weeks reading for hours every night when I first got sober. This place has a wealth of awesome experience to be gathered and utilized as well as the most amazing people to be found on the interwebs. You didn't mention what your plan was so I would only suggest not to discount any ideas you might see on here as something that you can use to help you along the way. ..Welcome to life and we are glad you're here!!..
Can I just say... the sleep is the most cash-money gangsta part of this whole sobriety thing. Oh... the sleep. It feels so so good.
