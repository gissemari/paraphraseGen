**DISCLAIMER DISCLOSURE**..Greetings all. I must admit that I've mostly been lurking here since my date of sobriety (15 Aug 2017) with a few scattered comments. But it's been a huge help to hear from you all learn from you and just be a part in whatever capacity of a positive and inspiring community. As far as disclaimers go the first I should mention is that *my flair still says 179 days although my Sober Grid app (more on which later) reads 180.* Whatever the case may be I'm at 180 in spirit and ready to share some stuff with y'all. ..Next *I by no means wish to give the impression that I don't still struggle with many aspects of sobriety sometimes consistently or that I am operating under an illusion of infinitely continuing sobriety.* Far from it. Nonetheless this is a list of things that have helped me out big time over the last six months and I will need to double down on them (and improvise come up with new solutions remain amenable to change) if I want to keep it up. I hope that some of them help in whatever way...Lastly before I jump in a few brief remarks on my situation. I'm in my early 30s always kept myself in pretty good shape but a slew of other health issues which should've been my cue to quit the sauce (you know how this goes) ended up getting subsumed into an admittedly ridiculous and logically byzantine justification for the continuation of said. I digress. More to the point I drank on and off for about a decade (started in my teens nothing too bad) before ramping things up big time over the last four years or so. Sunk into a routine of 8-20 drinks a day with some consistent periods of ludicrous intake not least for a pretty wiry frame. I functioned at a very high level throughout despite wearing down my body to the point of exhaustion/collapse/back injuries/etc. I managed for the most part to keep my drinking a secret (or at least confine it to a small group of folks). I'd have the occasional black out and attempt to initiate a fight bouts of shouting and so forth. Beyond lucky that no one ended up pulling my card and sending me to the ER. In any case the most important thing I should mention at this point is that *not only did I have (and still have thankfully) a supremely kind understanding helpful loving and ultimatum-setting-when-needed fianc e as well as a set of wonderful friends who were quite understanding and supportive but I have a very close family member who is a long-time AA lifer and (once I finally came to my senses and shared) has been a rock for me.* I draw this out a bit to bring up the following: in detox inpatient and IOP it became clear that I am unbelievably lucky to a) have this type of group around me and b) have managed not to nuke it completely. I am *more than aware* that this is not the case for all many or even some of us and I don't wish my comments/suggestions to sound insensitive to others if they take for granted that I have an awesome support system around me. My apologies if I offend anyone--it is so so far from my intent. Well let's get to the breaks. But first a final primer: checked into detox 15 Aug; 5 days symptoms pretty rough but was in an amazing facility; discharged still very shaken up and depressed; IOP for two months three days a week; meetings on and off 5-6 a week for starters sometimes now I go weeks without one. Here we go...**LEARN ABOUT HABIT LOOPS &amp; TAKE ACTION TO IMPLEMENT CHANGES**..To be honest I did a so-so job of this for a while and only recently began focusing on it as absolutely instrumental to continued success/sobriety. We all know in some way that as alcoholism (or any even tangentially related issue/addiction: smoking overeating gambling so on and so forth) shifts from something that "makes you feel better / relieves stress" (scare quotes of course) to something obviously antithetical to your survival and/or your actual stress-relief/happiness (i.e. when it becomes more of a prison than an outlet more a crutch than any semblance of escape) we've identified that the *habit has become so ingrained that a) it frightens us to even consider breaking the loop and b) the loop perpetuates itself in certain ways without/above our "awareness" as it were.* Okay. Big deal right? What crystallized for me both how powerful these habit loops are *and* how AA essentially mobilizes all of its techniques to help rewire (not simply overthrow) the mental mechanisms attached to the loop was reading [The Power of Habit](http://charlesduhigg.com/the-power-of-habit/). Simply put Duhigg's book is interesting in and of itself but it also discusses AA's methods (and successes) along with neuroscientific data and provides some helpful hacks/methods/solutions to breaking our loops. Put it this way: if your normal loop is STRESS (cue)--DRINK (routine)--DRUNK/HAPPY (reward) that is a fucking bitch of a loop to mess with right? First of all you have to list and identify the cues which can be myriad (stress social anxiety money injury while smoking near a bar depression you name it) then you have to figure out how to supplant the old routine with a new one *and manage to come up with a significant reward which in this case doesn't involve getting lit.* ..First off *writing out the list helps IMMENSELY.* Think of step four and step ten. Make an inventory. Continue to do so. Repeat. LIST TRIGGERS look inward recognize patterns. It's so simple but getting it on the page is a crucial step. Next draft a list of other possible routines when the cues arise. Exercise. Meditate. Deep breathing. Candy (not too much!) Gum. Mints. Go for a walk. Call a friend (AA of course again). As Duhigg points out the sponsor system and the pure fellowship/community of AA is essentially serving writ large to rewire all of these loops to go from CUE (want to drink) through ROUTINE (talk it out call meeting) to REWARD (sober fellowship friends). It works for a reason. For me among the most helpful routines since you can do it anywhere and anytime is focusing on the breath. Deep breathing exercises whether on the fly or with some sort of cheap meditation app. It might seem insane to suggest that this will EVER replace the high from booze or whatever but habits take time--it'll come. And most importantly you're already working on what for Duhigg is the "keystone habit" i.e. the one that proliferates into a slew of other positive changes. For us it's kicking the drink. Think of what other habits might then begin activating themselves--good relationships exercise proper diet etc...**READ READ READ**..Read the Big Book. Read *Living Sober.* Read the Bible. Read *anything!* For me it was important to go back to some of my interests in philosophy and theology and live in those for a little while dig deeper try to see them afresh. I cannot recommend William James enough--not just for his *sterling* and sympathetic account of alcoholism but also for his thoughts on how to change oneself how to persevere and so on. Eastern philosophy--whether Zen buddhism the Tao you name it--is also massively rich in terms of guidance but it also tends to offer something that I believe is of the essence in terms of why we read in recovery: it offers easily digestible often brief passages that you can cling to in times of crisis. Think of how simple yet effective the Serenity Prayer is. There are *thousands* of variations on that out there waiting to be read committed to memory cherished. Find what works for you--cling to it. Breathe deep. Read for solace and strength or find a buddy and set a schedule. Big Book study or working through some philosophy? Check out a novel you've been meaning to get to and discuss it. Get out of your headspace for a bit...**EXERCISE**..This'll be different for everyone. Personally although I grew up playing a ton of sports and maintained my athleticism for a long time in the last few years of my drinking and shortly after my detox I was a fucking mess. Back spasms pulled/torn muscles out of shape tendinitis weak lungs. You name it. It was a HUGE pain (obviously) to even think about exercising. But I started small and I *thought big.* Count small victories. You count "one day at a time" as a huge success in your sobriety. Of course it's huge! Maybe walking a block or two seems like nothing but make it into something. Hey next week I'll do two. Then next month I'll jog a bit. Hit the gym. Y'know. Have goals make them realistic but sort of lofty but *give yourself some slack if you don't hit them and be willing to pivot.* I struggled big time with these last two points for a while. I broke myself down and got sucked into a pity-party loop when my body still wasn't working or when my schedule rendered exercise more difficult etc. But perseverance will do some funky things to the old brain and the body can kick-start the mind back up again. There's volumes on volumes of scientific data on the endorphin release link with mindfulness etc so even if you have to fake-it-till-you-make-it with working out give it a shot. Plus it'll become its own new habit loop after a spell. Even better if you can get plenty of air outside with the added benefit of immersing yourself (back) in nature a bit...**MEDITATE/CULTIVATE MINDFULNESS**..I mentioned this above but it's worth doubling down. Whether prayer formal meditation or working at living more mindfully (in short living in the present cultivating calm and resting awareness) this is huge. For me I went back and forth on formal meditation practice for a few years during my drinking and while I *knew* that it was beneficial in so many ways I always found excuses to kick it or get off the mental-wagon for a bit. No more. It had to happen everyday then it did happen everyday and now I don't even think about it. A new habit loop. Ditto on this one in terms of the studies coming out all the time on how meditation helps recovery *in tandem with things like detox/rehab meetings exercise and so forth.* As I should've mentioned many times by now none of these can be leaned on in a vacuum--they are part of the tapestry of health and happiness that you're weaving day in and day out. I recommend as a sidebar [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app) or [Calm](https://www.calm.com/) but there are plenty of solid cheap options (and use youtube by all means to find others)...**GET SOBER GRID!**..Honestly I forget if this is a free app but even if it only had *one* function it'd still be worth it. After you offer some basic info it tracks a) days sober b) money saved and c) time saved from not drinking. It's thus a nice pick me up every day *and* it lets you chat with/hear from other members in the area (much like this sub tbh it helps forge some great connections even if you just lurk). Anyway: [SoberGrid](https://www.sobergrid.com/)...**HAVE A RELAPSE PLAN**..What? I was actually astounded when my therapist brought this one up. Why *plan* for a relapse? Well first of all (as she said) a huge number of recovering addicts will relapse at some point so well duh. More importantly though crafting a relapse plan a) allows you to admit that you aren't infallible (esp. if you're riding a high of newfound sobriety) and thus *aware* of what you must do to stay clean b) puts a plan in place so that *if* you slip it doesn't snowball. Frankly although I'm still terrified of relapsing I feel so much better knowing that I've thought through what it would be like what I'd do and how we'd work on picking the pieces up. To me having a relapse plan is just an extension of having a sobriety plan. It's that simple...**TO THINE OWN SELF BE TRUE**..Shakespeare gets the last word of course. I have heard *so many* amazing tales anecdotes and bits of advice here at AA meetings and to be honest just opening my ears up a little bit more in every day life. It has made me appreciate how this community can be such a fantastic bedrock while at the same time pointing to the fact that everyone's journey is going to necessarily be different--different cues different solutions different strokes for different folks. Thus in that spirt I suppose I should land here with the following: hopefully some of this helps even if it just helps one person in here. But you gotta carve your own path *while* leaning on the advice of those members of AA/people in your life that are walking the path *and know that they have to renew/restart the journey daily.* I am decidedly NOT at that stage. At best I can offer some bits and tips for what worked for me *in the first six months or so.* I'm gonna need to continue to work hard (harder) at this look for new avenues and breathe deep. ..Well actually Robert Penn Warren gets the last word. It's my go to passage for when things get hairy:..&gt; This / Is the process whereby pain of the past in its pastness / May be converted into the future tense / Of Joy...EDIT 1 &amp; 2: spelling..EDIT 3: IWNDW(all of)YT..

Thank you for posting and congratulations on 6 months!! I really enjoyed reading what has worked for you. .`having a relapse plan is just an extension of having a sobriety plan`. It gave me a lot to think about.  Thank you!
First off Congrats on 6 months Real.  Secondly your long-time lurking was *worth the wait* my friend. Wow. Very powerful share. Think about reposting it every once in a while to reach more peeps that are struggling relapsing as well as those 10 years sober...I will not drink with y'all today 
Thank you so much. The story of your journey is inspiring and also reminds me that there is always work to be done to support sobriety efforts. Congratulations on your six months. Hope to see you here more! IWNDWYT.
I'm just starting out but this post really resonated with me. I'm so looking forward to reading more and returning to Eastern literature..I can't remember the last time I treated myself to a new book - why waste the $20 bucks when a bottle of vodka is the same price? Amazing how quickly my priorities changed. .Thank you for the insight IWNDWYT. 
Beautifully written post thank you for your insight.
