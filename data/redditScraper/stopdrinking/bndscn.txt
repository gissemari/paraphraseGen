I'm seeing a substance abuse counselor who recommended that I either go to rehab IOP or try naltrexone. This is because for the past few years I've had a pattern of relapsing on alcohol after periods of sobriety. I just saw my new psychiatric practioner this week and she prescribed the naltrexone. The first day it made me dizzy and foggy headed. Yesterday was the second day and same thing plus 3 long naps. Prior to starting it my mood was really good (I have periods of depression) but I feel a bit depressed again. I decided to take the naltrexone this evening or before bed because then I'd be sleeping during the worst of these side effects. I understand that these side effects are supposed to get better but I'd like to hear from others what their experiences are with this med...If I've broken any rules let me know. This is the first time I've made a post on reddit. Thanks.

Naltrexone gives me insomnia but my psychiatrist has me scared into taking it. The statistics are wildly against going without it.
I've experienced nausea/puking &amp; lots of dizziness.  It hasn't affected my sleep patterns.  Side effects tend to vary from person to person.  I take an anti-depressant as well.
