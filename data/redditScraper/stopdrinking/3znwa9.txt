I'm in my 5th day and I would avoid putting myself in these situations (which involves fridges and beer in it) can you cancel seeing your parents? Call saying you're sick ? (You are sick). Maybe in a few weeks you could deal with it I feel it's  not a good idea this early in recovery.
I usually come here when I have previously relapsed in the past. I'm not condoning relapse being a good thing. But when I have relapsed the withdrawals and repercussions  become worse and worse and sobriety stretches become longer and longer! I am dry right now and I've gotten self analytical and introspective which helps me break down my cognition and figure out how and what pieces are being affected that cause me to consider drinking during times when I feel like i have everything under control. You will succeed. Just think about the dangers and irreversible consequences you can go through from a night of drinking. It's really frightening. Go to meetings! It's OK to ask for help. We as humans should help ourselves through battles 
Just hang on tight. Literally...find a warm fuzzy blanket and squeeze that shit. Breath fill your lungs and blow it out slowly. You are going to be okay this is temporary. What are you doing for support. I go to AA and it has saved my life I've met so many amazing sober people and can pick up the phone and call them anytime.  Just keep hanging on this will pass. .
In early sobriety these were the times where being able to go to AA meetings on a regular basis literally saved my life.
