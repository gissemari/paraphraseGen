Always a beer with lunch everday for the last year. Can't seem to shake it. My head hits my pillow sober but I can't keep myself from that beer in the afternoon. Anyone else struggle with this?

Beer or a margarita was my go to for lunches.  It's like it was my secret stress reliever for work-related stress from the morning.  ..Now I gotta find a new simple pleasure for my lunches.
Try an NA beer maybe?  That was how I started.
try watering the beer down with water. it wont taste as good so maybe you will drink less.
