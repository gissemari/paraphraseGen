I'm at a loss. As of today I am a year and a half sober. Two years ago I was heavily and dangerously addicted to Xanax I had 12 packs of beer on a nightly basis and I smoked weed pretty much daily. Because of my addictions and my behaviors that came about because of said addictions the love of my life my immediate family and I were consistently on either rocky terms or completely not speaking...Back then depression was assumed. Of course I was depressed...my life was garbage. I was toxic and lonely and going absolutely nowhere...Fast forward two years and I'm sober. Totally and completely. I live with my boyfriend (same one who watched me struggle with the pills etc.) who loves me unconditionally supports and nurtures me and seems to have infinite patience for my ups and downs. I have more than enough to be grateful for. My life is endlessly gifted with love and happiness.....but I'm miserable...Sobriety has left me bored and honestly angry. And then guilty because I dont understand where this anger and unhappiness are coming from nowadays. I cant blame the withdrawals or the hangovers anymore. I eat healthier and I exercise I keep stable relationships with friends and family...And every day I seem to sleep a little later in the day. Do a little less than the afternoon before. Nothing motivates me besides basic need anything past that I easily lose patience with...Is this life? I'm 35 and I feel so...disappointed. Lost. Guilty for not being happier for the people who have been there with me at my worst...I need help.

Have you tried any kind of counselling or therapy ? ..do you have kids ? a job or career ? What kind of goals do you have or what hobbies do you have ?..Congrats on 18 mths of sobriety thats great ...I'm not working but I go to the gym and do classes most days  I try and meet a friend for lunch or breakfast once a week . I volunteer at my kids school and I go to AA meetings .........so far all of these are helping me keep busy and it feels like I am being productive .
it sounds like you would benefit from engaging in positive activities that challenge you:..hiking.running.cycling .swimming .kayaking .art..don't just suppress that negative addictive energy; embrace it reverse it and channel it into positive activities that will help heal years of substance abuse 
Firstly congratulations on the year and a half of sobriety! That is abosolutely **amazing** and you can be so proud of yourself...Like you I suffer from depression. Have suffered from it (to varying degrees) through most of my adult life. Based on my own experience (I'm not a medical expert) it sounds like you need medication for your depression. (Like I do.) Or are you on one already? You do know that **antidepressants are not addictive** right? So there is no need to worry about that. Of course the medication alone can only help so much; based on what you wrote I think you would definitely benefit from some type of therapy (again: if you're not already seeing a therapist).
Therapy exercise and meditation are all things that I must do in order to grow and maintain happiness. You may want to talk to a psychiatrist as well. There's a chance your brain chemistry needs help...
My best advice is to start going to meetings and really working the steps. Being involved with AA or any 12 step program and really working the steps throughly with a Sponser (while being there for others) really helps people work on there inner self and understanding what drove them to drink. Just stopping drinking or drugging really is just the beginning the real healing comes from finding and working on ourselves (which comes from working the step and sharing it with others). But congratz on 18months- that's a real accomplishment! 
Congratulations on the steps you've taken. I agree with some comments here about finding a hobby. ..For me when I am in dark times I rely on video games to kick start my mind if I feeling down. Eventually I'm good as my mind meets the strategical challenge. My passion is during the weekdays during business hours (trading) so that helps too.  ...But I stumbled after the day was over and on weekends. Recently after being on fence last few weeks I decided to quit too. Podcasts could be another interesting thing to help kick start your mind or books on tapes.  ...Do you have any favorite genre's? Loads of good stuff out there.    .
In AA the point of the steps is not to make you quit drinking...its to keep you from.being miserable so that you don't have to drink...Stopping drinking is the first part...I.promise you that you do not have to be bored or miserable..
I feel the same way although I am much newer to sobriety to you.  The only thing giving me any hope right now is this Buddhism meeting I've been going to weekly along with readings.  Sometimes I read things and get these lightning bolts of HOLY FUCK THIS IS IT.  Of course it's a long hard process to really change but that's what is giving me hope.  ..Good luck!  Sorry to hear you are still sad.  
I totally feel where you are coming from. Congratulations on being sober so long. That is a true accomplishment and you should be very proud of yourself like we are. ..As far feeling miserable and angry you may have some kind of clinical depression ( I assume you from previous comments about Zoloft ). That's a tough thing to live with but it can be managed with medication exercise diet and a lot of other things. Sadly there isn't a magic bullet that just cures depression. Medication works for some people others it doesn't. The same with lifestyle choices...I recommend you begin your journey to find what works for you. I have never been to an AA meeting but I have heard they are good. Church groups enthusiast groups hobby groups etc. also work for a lot of people. One of the keys I have discovered is to keep positively busy. I use the word positively because we can be busy and it's negative to us like burdening ourselves with too many chores in a day or self destructing ourselves. Maybe changing up your daily routine and devoting yourself to some more extra curricular activities would help...I also assume you're a writer from your Reddit name. I don't know how deep you are into the industry but if you stick around writing groups or circles enough a question will eventually pop up and that question is this: Do writers drink because they write or do they write because they drink? ..There's a plethora of information out there on the subject if you can find it. I won't go into great detail here but some people believe we ( writers ) drink because we create our own little worlds and live in them. There's also the chance that we put too strict of a deadline or word count on ourselves and at the end of the day if we didn't write 5000 words or finished a rough draft in less than a month we feel like we failed ourselves. ..Reading about Stephen King's battle with alcoholism and drug addiction helped me. Maybe one of your favourite authors has a similar story that you can relate to and draw inspiration from.
Life is not easy unfortunately. These ups and downs can be hard. You know drinking will complicate that so rule that out. Maybe you need to talk to someone or join yoga or something to help you meditate. Try and figure out your anxiety. Good luck! 
Sending supportive thoughts your way..You might consider seeing your doctor to begin (or change?) antidepressant medication. Meds and therapy helped changed my life around over a few years. I associate depression with apathy and a lack of motivation. It's really uncomfortable. Alcohol definitely makes it worse. Good for you for leaving it behind. IWNDWYT 
Your sober brain is telling you you got some work to do still. Pay attention to this. It's a great opportunity to make thing better. Counseling helps some people. A good pro can do a lot. Not drinking for lots of us is just the start. Good luck. 
Have you read into Buddhism? I was severely depressed still battle suicidal thoughts now and again more frequently for some reason wondering is this all there is? But then I remember to stop thinking and start feeling and all of the sudden it kinda turns around. I hope you're doing alright. I'm going childfree celibate and sizing down everything I own as my next challenge for the next 3 years. It's what I do when I'm bored with life. See if I can be happy with nothing. Once I'm there well supposedly you can reach enlightenment so maybe the suicidal thoughts will stop haha. Also the consumption of western media will really fuck with all of us so I try to be careful with what I consume and make sure my emotional boundaries are up before letting it hit my feelings...Sorry for the preachy ramble if it came off that way IWNDWYT
In the same boat as you. Unfortunately long term use of Xanax can mess up our brain chemicals a little bit. I am constantly sad and feel isolated and lonely. Not to mention my brain chemicals are already messed up from a lot of childhood trauma. .I am working on adopting a puppy learning Buddhism and I am thinking about trying to get my pilots license. .My doctor tells me that doing things that you find interesting slowly helps you build back ur chemicals to normal levels. Each activity you find acts like an anchor for your long term happiness. ..We will all get better together sobriety is just the first step.....
