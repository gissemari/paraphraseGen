So I'm signed up for r/stopsmoking (51 days) r/nofap (One day a lot of relapses) and I probably should be on a few other subs for a few other substances too...I've been drinking for about 11 years and I would say heavily too. I don't have any rock bottom stories how it had an actual impact on my life (outside of myself 1 maybe 2 friends/family). The most one could say "It's all in his head. Maybe it's real maybe it's not"...Usually I'm 100% sober about 2-3 nights a week but this past month and half I have been drinking non-stop (maybe 4 days sober in a 40 day period)...On the weekends I'd start drinking at 9 am. All by myself...Yesterday I started to drink at 9 am but decided to stop. The rest of the day was difficult. I felt weird off but not in a hangover sort of way but just that a drink would cure it...Today has been a bit rough. Same feeling. Same need. Same urge. I felt it during the day a while ago but I had always intended to drink (I had a drink within 5 minutes of being home) so I didn't think it was that bad knowing that I was going to drink...I don't want to drink tonight (well ok I mean I do) and I hate that I'm beginning to have physical signs of withdrawal. It runs in the family too...So here's my first day...I never had the physical manifestation of the need to drink (Wanting to drink is a different story) but for the first time I don't feel like it's purely a mental battle (not that i win those a lot anyway)..EDIT: I recently moved in with a roommate who is a lot more social than me so I have been around more people this past year all who happen to believe I have an issue with drugs and alcohol. Maybe it's not all in my head.

Welcome to the sub as you say you may as well grab a badge for the ride. Another sub that sprang to mind as I was reading this was /r/addiction it may be worth checking out.  Good luck.
Hi welcome to /r/stopdrinking!..&gt;On the weekends I'd start drinking at 9 am. All by myself...Yeah....maybe it's not all in your head.  I've never heard the above statement said by a normal/moderate drinker...Welcome to Day 1.  There are lots of resources on the sidebar for your review Saturday Shares that may be useful and plenty of prior posts to read.  Staying active in this sub was a major help over the past few months...Hang in there!
