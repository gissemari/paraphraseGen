I ve got 4 beers left here and I constantly feel like I want to drink but than I get more time over but this weird stomach feel doesn t go away plus all the other crap...After some calculations I also found out that I ve consistently been over 2%o up to 3%o Alcohol in my blood a day (not all day long but top levels) and I don t know if it s safe to do this at home but I don t have insurance anyway.  .Any suggestions?  .

A doctor is the best person to do an evaluation of detox needs. Tapering is another option. ..See:.* http://hams.cc/taper/
