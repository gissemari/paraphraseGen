This was another planned relapse and hopefully it will be my last. I took my Antabuse this morning so I won't be drinking with you tonight. I certainly feel like shit though. I binged hard this past week all because I used a concert and a Halloween party as an excuse.

I will not drink with you today. Thank you for being so honest. You have this.
Good to see ya back :)...Are you following any particular path in conjunction with Antabuse?
