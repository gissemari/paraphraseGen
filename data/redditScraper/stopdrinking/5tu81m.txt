Hi everyone  sorry to be posting so often but that's the only way i can cope at the moment.  ..I was just wondering how many of you have badly relapsed and how did you get to where you are now ? Would love to hear other people's experiences.

I tried to moderate for about 2 years. Didn't work. Quit drinking probably...6-8 times before this last time finally stuck. I'd go about 40-70 days without drinking then bam! This time I hung on for the 90 day mark since 3 months is when many people report starting to 'get it'. After that it kept getting easier with a few bumps in the road. "Fall down 7 times get up 8" is the quote I lived for :) Best wishes!
Hiya Spotty. In 2014 I gave up for 4-5 months. Can't remember exactly. ..Following that I drank for about a month not heavily but slowly it turned into everyday by xmas...In Jan 2015 I quit again lasted about 10 days. I started drinking up to 2 bottles of red a night then. It's lasted about 2 years with the odd break of clarity every 3 months which resulted  in 4/5 days of promises to myself that were always broken. Last year from late summer until Dec I managed to stay sober in the week and just drink weekends.  ..This year in late Jan something snapped and I've just stopped completely. It's hard but I just can't bear going back to day zero again.  ..Relapses are part of the journey for me. ..When climbing a mountain you sometimes have to go down and round to go all the way up. 
Some many relapses. So many different layers to a plan on how to stop Drinking. I now take a medication that will make me sick if I drink. And it works. The threat works.
