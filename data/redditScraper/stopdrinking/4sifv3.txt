Hi everyone. I hope everyone is coping well with their struggles. I'm on day 8 of sobriety and feeling incredibly different already. The first major change I've noticed since yesterday is that I have an energy level I am not accustomed to. After working a 13 hour day I went to sleep at midnight. This morning I woke up at 7am cleaned my whole house before throwing on the suit and tie and heading to work. My relationship with my wife is slowly improving. We even laughed together a few times and played with our cat. I know that sounds like nothing but considering the last several months it's a remarkable improvement. She accidentally even called me honey and then remembered she was still mad. Lol. I didn't call her out on it. I still don't foresee us sharing the same bed anytime soon but we definitely are behaving as friends for now. I always thought alcohol made me more comfortable around people. It turns out that while it's true what actually caused me to hide from interaction was alcohol withdrawals anxiety and guilt. When I'm sober I actually do function far better in life. I'm in a great mood and I'm even enjoying listening to music which I haven't done sober in years. Keep hanging in there and I will not drink with you today.
