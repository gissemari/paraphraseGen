Hi SD..It has been a while since I've been on this sub and reading the posts.  About a year ago I used this sub to stop drinking and help me stop abusing alcohol. I was in a really bad place in life and  the compassion and support of this sub really helped me out of that dark place and into a much better one. Dealing with stress and understanding myself came a lot easier when I could think straight (go figure). ..Overall I have drank considerably less this past year and the previous 4-5 years. I still have drank on a couple occasions this year and found it not as enjoyable. A definite lethargy sets into my body after drinking and thinking about the experience has never led me to think it was good. My relationship with alcohol has certainly changed and there have been small victories of the days i haven't drank this past year (which is the majority of them!!). ..Throughout the year i've kept my badge on this sub updated knowing that i would return to use this community to finally rid myself of alcohol once and for good. Finally I believe that day is here. The last time I drank was on Oct. 22 and today is the day i am deciding to start the path to not drinking completely. ..I wish you all the best SD with your struggles and with your own paths. This community is easily one of the best on Reddit or anywhere. My path begins today and so with no better words of beginning (and middle/end really)...I will not drink with you today...~AWC
