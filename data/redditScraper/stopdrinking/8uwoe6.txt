Is starting to do some mental gymnastics plotting planning which wine bar stops to make on the way home...why am I close to salivating? OMG...A little ramble here.....Anyway I just walked over the work fridge and I'm stuffing myself with baby carrots.  I want something sweet but I have a cupcake and pint of Ben &amp; Jerry's Cherry Garcia waiting for me at home if I can just fixate on that.  Honestly I think I'm just hungry. H-ALT!  I had a craving last night but realized I hadn't really eaten a substantive lunch so after work I stuffed myself with a cheeseburger &amp; fries.  Not the healthiest but the cravings disappeared.  I WAS STUFFED and nothing else was entering my mouth. In fact I went home and essentially passed out from food coma...It's bothering me that I've been on this sobriety (alcohol-free) path for over a year and I've made some significant changes but still not where I want to be and still really struggling to piece together significant time.  It's worse now I think.  ..I'm meditating and working hard to stay present. July 30th though is the day I'm calling in to take an assessment to start a nearby IOP.  I was hoping to start in July but it's not possible since I'll be travelling for work and will miss more than a week. Not allowed! I feel like I'm just buying time until then. It's so weird though...I have to wait to get the additional support I need...Anyway just trying to be in the moment and ride this out.

Oh god have I been there. You're at work and suddenly all you can think about is how you're going to stop for alcohol on the way home. It's almost like a given by the time you actually leave and you start to get excited while finishing up the day. I try to acknowledge these thoughts right as they pop up and immediately think  that's not an option . Also it helps me to pinpoint exactly what it was that got me thinking about drinking after work and decide if it is really worth it. For example if a mistake you made or a comment from a coworker made you upset. Is the mistake going to get you fired? No then fix it and move on. Is that coworker maybe being unpleasant because of something going on in their own life or are they just an asshole? Who knows but it's not worth you giving up your sobriety over. If it was over no particular incident then it's probably just my brain playing a trick to get alcohol or as you said I may be hungry or tired. I'm glad you're getting help soon with IOP and in the meantime stay strong! I won't drink with you today.
