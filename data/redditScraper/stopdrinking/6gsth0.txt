Hey folks ..I would like to start off by saying I don't believe that I have a major drinking problem. I've made some mistakes had some nights where I have overdone it but otherwise maintain a pretty balanced and functional life. That being said I have gained some weight over the past few years and noticed that drinking has hurt some of my goals that I set. With that in mind as times become busier and my priorities change I would like to step away from it. ..Maybe giving it a break will be a wakeup call or maybe it will just be another positive choice. I am not sure. What I will try to do is keep an open mind and reach out for support when I struggle. I found it was a really effective method with quitting smoking so I thought I would give it a try here as well. ..Thanks

I have lost 40 lbs and gained a aym habit since i have quit drinking. I went to a supplement store and they set me up with a good program. I love the compliments about how good i look now. I feel even better though! Good luck...I will not drink with you today!
Congrats on quitting smoking.  I quit smoking too.  It was harder for me than quitting drinking.  I want to be healthy and I gained 20 pounds too.  Those along with the ginormous waste of money alcohol is are my incentives.  I won't drink with you today.
Well i figured i was drinking 2 to 4 thousand extra calories a day and not going to the gym. So cut that out and start 6 days a week at the gym and you have to buy new cloths
