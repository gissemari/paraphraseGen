My last go at sobriety I made it two weeks then bought a bottle of wine to celebrate on day 15 (today). It was a Monday and I was so proud of making it through a second weekend but I barely gave a thought to whether I should or not just decided last minute to swing by a wine shop on my way home. ..This time has felt so different. Last time (and all of the times before that) staying sober felt like a sentence. Each day was a chore to struggle through so that I could see the number click higher. This time it just feels like a new beginning. A scary and exciting adventure. I still think about drinking and some days are harder than others but in general when I do start to entertain the notion of drinking I quickly flash back to the sketchy itchy sweaty and gross sensation of withdrawal. That will probably fade I know that I will face challenges and I certainly can't say that I will never drink again but for now this feels right. I hope that these ninety days will give me enough time to reflect heal and develop healthy new habits so that I can make the right decisions for myself in the future. This could very well be teetotalism. ..My friends have been supportive and I have been so much more social in these last two weeks. One of my friends made an off hand comment about how she wished I could drink with her at such and such an event but it was said innocently enough. Funnily enough most people don't really seem to be aware of how problematic my drinking was. I thought it was obvious. ..I had been worried about another friend and how my sobriety would impact our friendship. Instead she is going on methadone for a painkiller addiction and is going clean herself. A few friends have even expressed envy at my self restraint (I'm still mostly sticking to the "trying to get healthy and in shape" angle)...I have more energy have been getting things done and have felt so positive even through some very stressful times. I don't think that I've watched tv once in these two weeks. Instead I've been calling my friends and family members have caught up on what is going on in their lives and have been able to be a supportive friend. I have been taking steps to move into a healthier living situation but do it without burning bridges. Amazingly (to me) I didn't even drink on my birthday and it was a big one. ..I feel good. I don't think I've hit the pink cloud yet (if I ever do) but this feels right and I can't wait to find out more about being a sober grownup.

Honesty is freedom..... tell your friends
Congrats to you! Personally I am almost done with my own 30 day challenge. It's funny because this experiment is/was an attempt to learn to moderate...but 90% of me wants to keep going...
