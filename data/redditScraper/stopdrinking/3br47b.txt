I was sitting outside with the dogs this morning and I realized how far I have come and how happy I am.  The 4th is right around the corner and the thought that I might struggle has not entered my mind once. I am happy that I don't drink I am proud and I am living life.  I just got back from a camping/tubing/fishing/hiking trip with my family. We spent 4 amazing days at one of my most favorite places on earth.  There was drinking around me of course but not ONCE did I ever think I was missing out or think "gosh I want a drink."  There was a group of men that camped a few spots down from us and one man caught my attention the whole time I was there.  I never saw him do anything but drink. He would get up and have a solo of coffee and then switch to beer.  He sat around camp all day and drank and it made me sad for him.  He didn't do this ...[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Jnet3Fd.jpg) and he didn't hike up and see this view...[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/5o1JYBL.jpg)  and he didn't fish until it was dark...[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/V4hYLDk.jpg) he missed how awesome the moon looks on a clear night through a telescope...[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Na0ZM43.jpg) One night he was down by the river attempting a campfire he seemed nice and I attempted to talk to him. He was slurring so badly that I could only understand a couple words he was saying.  He was so thin and was missing teeth.  Alcohol did this maybe drugs I don't know...but what I saw was alcohol and it made me sick to my stomach and so sad for him. I walked away with a heavy heart.  Addiction is a beast and I am so thankful I chose life over it.  These days I am addicted to happy and thankful and grateful and some days just being ... sobriety has given this to me.  Happy sober Hump Day everyone!

i was that man just over four years ago and I must never forget it.  I too get sad when I see people like that and just want to help them.  If only it was that easy.  Alcohol is a bastard and it sucks all the joy out of life ever so slowly. The slowly part is the worst bit for me as people don't even notice that they are being sucked alive.  Thank fook I am free of that today. ..Thanks for posting makes me feel grateful for my sobriety \o/
Yeah that was me when I camped too. Except I didn't even do the coffee first thing :(. Nothing more refreshing than a 7am beer.  Looks like a magical camping spot! I love this post!
That's a beautiful river! Isn't it great to **be** somewhere like that?
This sadly reminds me of my last family camping trip. I stayed behind most of the time while they went on hikes or adventures so I could down a few beers in the meantime while no one noticed how much I was drinking. All while missing out on all the beauty. Not this year though looking forward to the trip and staying sober this time.
Oh golly GoT!!!  Those are some wonderful memories you shared with us! Remember that old wham! song/video...Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go and their CHOOSE LIFE t-shirts? Now I have an ear bug dang it. ..His camping sounds like a very familiar one. And float trips? What a pain in the ass when you're a wine drinker. Nope. Do not miss one bit. Personal side note: because of the home life situation I was in up until recently I have not actually done a camping trip since I got sober (actually in 5 years).  Now that I have changed the situation I was in I am totally excited to get out there soon!!
