It's midnight and on Sunday I gave up two things- a relationship that was toxic and alcohol. Both have lately been so tied together that I didn't know what kind of person I truly was without them. I'm learning to love myself...Yet 4th of July was our holiday. We'd light the barbecues get the beers and be wasted by the time fireworks lit up the skies. As the day comes closer I'm trying to hold onto every bit of strength to not pick up the bottle and drown my memories of him. Today is officially over however  and I did not drink. Tomorrow I will not drink. Anyone here going through the same struggle as a major holiday approaches I will not drink with you!

Some what similar I made the choice to stop recently and she left me soon after. I unfortunately gave in tonight. I wish I just stayed on my path if that means anything. It's not worth it. Stay strong. 
I'm also separating from a 4.5 year marriage its so hard to be newly alone and sober. It's for the best and sometimes it's a big relief. But I'm sad and get heartsick- even though it's a mutual split and inevitable doesn't make it any easier. We loved each other we just fell out of love and can't function together anymore...But drinking wont make anything better it's just more pain....
