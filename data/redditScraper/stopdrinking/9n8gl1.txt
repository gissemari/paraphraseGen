Hi all! 3-1-1 days!!!..I'm on a badass trip to Iceland with friends from college. I was a tiny bit worried that they would be drinking a lot and I'd be struggling a bit being sober. ..Strange...4 people traveling for a week and only 4 drinks have been ordered and two shots at home (I consumed zero drinks)...So six drinks consumed so far between 3 people. That's like NOTHING. ..This makes me realize that my drinking was ABNORMAL. I drank daily and about 3 drinks a night minimum with weed. Always. ..Sometimes now that it's been 311 days I forget that I do have a problem with drinking. ..On this trip I'm recommitted to my sobriety. ..IWNDWYT

Huge upshot to Iceland as far as drinking goes is it'd cost you a pretty penny to do serious drinking there. Beautiful country though enjoy your time there.
