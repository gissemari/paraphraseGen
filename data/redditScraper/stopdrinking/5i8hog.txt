What's up Wednesdays are when we celebrate our sobriety see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** I am preparing for the holidays and have been wondering what to give my loved ones this year. I feel so indebted to them for how they have stood by me that I've worried that anything I give them won't measure up. But then I read the following: ** The greatest gift to give the people you love is your recovery. ** And I realized that this statement is actually true: that's all they *really* want anyway.. .**Struggle:** I have ongoing health issues (unrelated to alcohol) that now seem to be a permanent part of my life...**General:** Here's a Holiday Party Survival Tip: Present yourself as the official event photographer! I arrived at my book club's holiday party with my digital camera and announced  I'm the new club photographer!  No social awkwardness because I was busy snapping photos everyone was delighted to be in the limelight and it totally took the focus off the fact that I was not drinking...Do you have any Holiday Party Survival Tips of your own to share?
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph - Totally on top of Christmas presents this year.  No last minute trying to overnight packages to the West Coast this year!.Struggle- Still feeling super lethargic and lazy.  Sleeping a ton and not very motivated to do much.  .General- I was at Whole Foods yesterday and even when I was drinking I found the in-store bar totally bizarre.  And it's always packed!
Triumph- just went to my 10yo daughters play. She got the main role and her sober father was absolutely thrilled to be there. ..Struggle- getting a little worried about the holidays. I've never made it through a holiday season sober...ever. But it's all about today for me. ..General- feeling very good lately. Not drinking today is saving me day after day. I can't believe how stuck I was compared to today. 
Day 4 here and feeling accomplished. Friend came over last night I cooked dinner and we watched a film and I...didn't drink... I found it really tough between 5pm and around 9 then it was ok. Nowhere near enough sleep because it's an early start today but I do think I slept a little better. Thanks for all the support :-)
Triumph - I feel more determined about my recovery than ever this time and i am very much looking forward to a sober holiday!.Struggle - Tomorrow is usually the day i relapse but i won't let that happen this time..General - I'm getting surgery for my knee tomorrow so i won't be able to exercise the next couple of weeks.
Triumph- Joined this sub wrote my story out and posted it! Yeah! (Opening up is haaard.) Memory is improving!.Struggle- Haven't figured out how to socialize and getting lonely.. .General- I don't know what to say. Life is pretty weird in general... 
**Triumph:** All my major holiday shopping is done! Two weeks earlier than usual!..**Struggle:** My spell of depression is lasting longer than usual. I'm handling it OK. Ive been conserving My energy for my family duties. Those are going well but my work has suffered. Today starts a busy week of work and I'm going to be a bear at home :(..**Party Tips:** I've got kids. "We have to go NOW before a meltdown" is fine to tell my wife and she often doesn't realize **I'm** the one melting down.
Triumph: Finished day 3 sober  .Struggle: Life in general is a mess right now and there are times I feel sure a beer would cure everything. I know that isn't the case but it doesn't keep my brain from suggesting it as a coping mechanism. .General: I am sleeping way more than usual and don't know if  that's a good or bad thing. .Take care all! 
Forgot I was subbed here. I guess I must have made a new account and gotten a badge right before I checked my self into an in-patient facility. Turned out to be a good idea because I haven't been keeping track. Feels good. ..However I am only 30 days or so clean from my latest addiction. . . Heroin! That shit took everything from me as did alcohol. Similar effects on my life it's just that H did in 6 months the same type of damage I'd caused with years of alcohol abuse. Crazy. But I'm free. Wish I had a cigarette can't quit everything all at once right...Hello r/stopdrinking  my name is Algernon and I'm an addiction seeking son of a bitch. I think I'll stick around here.
Triumph: I told someone at work that I don't drink! They were talking about the gift they bought for our work party and I'd like it because it's a bottle of JD. And I just said "I don't drink". He kind of just steam rolled on I don't think he was really interested in having a conversations just bragging about his awesome gift. Whateves that's the first time I said anything about it at work and it just felt natural to say it. ..Struggle: Someone here posted once describing their cravings as "the tide is high". I wish I had saved it so I could give proper credit (and it was a good post) but that's how I've been feeling lately. So much going on with the holidays and what not. The tide is high but I have to keep on swimming. ..General: Tomorrow is my work party and it's the first holiday party I have to navigate soberly. I plan on stopping to get the biggest coffee DD has to offer before I arrive so my drink choice will be already decided. I'm also going to avoid that bottle of JD in the gift swap I'm crossing my fingers for something useful like k-cups or oven mitts. 
Triumph: Got a new receiver from a thrift store for $14 it's a million times better than my old one. ..Struggle: My "bubble of apathy" as a shrink once called it seems to be getting stronger.  I find it harder and harder to care about anything/anyone.  I'm also fighting depression lately but that's par for the course anymore. ..general:  My reddit secret santa finally marked my gift as shipped.  I don't think I posted my amazon wishlist or anything either so it will be real fun to see what a stranger gets me based on a questionnaire. 
Triumph: I've established a more consistent sleep schedule for myself! For the first time in years I haven't needed to take a sleep aid to doze off. Excited for more positive changes to come...Struggle: I've also been sort of anxious the last couple of days after that initial burst of sober-positivity wore off. Right now I'm finishing my last bits of grad school work for the semester. ..Also a little nervous as I'm traveling to my boyfriend's hometown this week. I have the feeling I will be in situations where I'm meeting new people/his family and will feel compelled to join them in a drink (/feel too awkward to turn it down). I'm not sure what the future holds but I'm looking forward to meeting my two-week goal first and foremost...General: I've been staying at my parents' house the past few days and snacking every waking hour on junk food. Good reminder of why I don't keep my apartment stocked with anything except seltzer...I can't be trusted!..Hope everyone's well!
Triumph: made it through a fun weekend with no alcohol. Almost two weeks subbing...Struggle: I think my so is dealing with depression although he denies it. Keeps saying that he's unhappy and everything that gives him joy is false. These things come up more when he's drinking and there's no way to reason with or comfort him...In general: I'm doing really good but it feels like other things are falling apart.
**Triumph**: 100 day sober! 30 days smoke free!!!!!..**Struggle**: I still can't run. Stupid Achilles...**General**: Play games! I find that people are always awkward with or without a drink at parties where they don't all know each other so playing a few simple games can get people talking and having fun. Just don't make em drinking games obviously!..There are so many things you can play it doesn't just have to be charades or pictionary. One of my favourites is a card game called Good morning Jack. ..Five cards all have actions so the King everyone has to salute the Queen everyone has to bow the Jack you say: "Good morning Jack" then you can assign actions to two other cards. You deal them out like snap (so you can't see your cards) each player puts a card down face up when there is an action card the last person to do the action picks up all the cards...It can be seriously fun and funny!.
Triumph: my boyfriend went out drinking with his friends last night. I cleaned the house a bit ate a healthy dinner and was in bed asleep quite early! Usually went left alone I get very tempted to drink but it didn't even cross my mind!..Struggle: I have ongoing stress at work. I'm also a bit worried how to tell my family I've stopped drinking. I'll be seeing them next week and I think with each day I gain more confidence in my decision. Hopefully it will be fine...General: happy to have this sub! Thanks everyone!
Triumph: I'm back on track with my calorie app and I went to yoga last night. I've lost 3 pounds since I stopped drinking. I'm trying not to be impatient. Slow and steady wins the race...Struggle: Worrying about money. It's going to be a struggle to pay for my daughter's tuition next semester. I'm trying not to let my worry make me a holiday Scrooge...General: On Thanksgiving I brought over a 2-liter bottle of diet soda which I don't normally keep around the house so it's something of a treat. My daughter was my refiller and kept refilling my cup when it got low. That was helpful. 
Triumph - this is the first Dec 14 in at least 2 years (maybe more but my journal only goes back to 2014) that I'm not finishing a multi-day bender sweating and shaking and suicidal on the couch..Struggle - Feeling a bit complacent like it's too easy this time around maybe?..General - In two sleeps I will be debt-free once again and I'm so excited to move forward with a great deal more stability in my life (financial and otherwise)
**Triumph:** I am a DIY champ fixing cars and household items lately. Mad skills. Cooking too   tonight is [Sweet &amp; Sour Chicken Night]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4Qr_Eqtrc4). People everywhere seem to be very nice and I am glad when I get out. Best interactions seem to be with random people. Go figure. ..**Struggle:** Struggling to get thru the maze of admissions for my kid into rehab. So BCBS   do you actually do anything to help people or only sell your insurance? If I have questions why can't I call you and discuss? Aren't YOU the provider? Need to find an in-patient facility as a starter and can't fly him to Passageways Malibu California like on TV. This is real world...**General:** I have Christmas cards going out for the first time in 20 years. .
**Triumph:**  Despite my long weekend being more stressful than I wanted I made sure to get myself to a hot springs and spent the night out of town enjoying my freedom and autonomy.  I took great care of myself and that fills me up so much better than drinking ever did...**Struggle:**  Up and down with the GF round and round we go.  Just when I've made up my mind this is unhealthy for me either my fear keeps me here or she shows up in such a genuine and loving way that I question my decision to end things...**General:**  I'm so sorry to hear you're experiencing health issues /u/sfgirlmary.  I hope they are treatable and fade away.  I'm not going to too many parties but my main survival action is to eat a ton of delicious food and always have some sort of NA drink in my hand.  If I am feeling uncomfortable I am totally okay with leaving.  Most folks are so wrapped up in either their booze or their conversation that it's not a big deal to just walk away.  I can always reconnect with real friends later.
Triumph: my kid is growing into his personality and it's crazy how similar we are. I am soooooo glad that I am sober and fully present to witness it. ..Struggle: I'm having to witness it via face time and on the one weekend a month I get him (he lives 3 hours away). Not being around him every day hurts especially since he's now old enough to give me crap about it. Gotta figure out how to move there within the next year or two because he'll need a positive male influence in his life and it's gonna be me (in my Justin Timberlake voice)...General: at parties I just tell people that I don't drink because I hate the decisions that drunk me makes. Since most of them have seen those decisions they tell me that they're impressed that I have the strength to be around alcohol without drinking which only reinforces my will to keep fighting one day at a time. ..And I also eat a shitload of food which leaves no room for fluids. 
Triumph: I spent the day yesterday with my older brother (by 14 years) we dont know eachother really at all. So I was really nervous and would've drank away the fear the night before but instead I met him at his ecit gate at the airport wide awake and hangover free. .He only had a few hrs in my city but we made the most of it. Worked out together because hes a powerlifter and I'm looking into getting involved in all that. Took my son on a walk and hung out. My house was messy but no beer bottles or alcohol bottles to br ashamed of. Just normal clean laundry piles and kid toys. It was a good feeling and i had an amazing time with him...Struggle. My son is sick today so I can2t take him to rhe gym daycare which means I cant workout so i feel depressed and bored :/  normally id drink with this boredom but i picked up some lacroix. So la croix and netflix tonight. 
Triumph: despite depression rearing this week I've been going to work eating as healthily as possible and using mindfulness sleep and episodes of Catfish to cope .Struggle. Depression dark thoughts want to sleep 24 hours a day.General: I had sushi tonight   went on a long walk and currently cozy on my sofa  
T:  Catching up on some sleep. ..S:  My eye is twitching! ..G:  I went and hung out with some people i haven't seen in 4 years. They didn't say anything about me not drinking. 
Not drinking today. 
T:  Taking some time off to take care of myself.  Not drinking today...S:  Big ol' fight with my non-boyfriend.  Hard to tell who's the bigger jerk and who started it.  It's really messing with my head and I am very sad but at least I'm not drinking today...G:  To apologize for being a jerk Imaginary Boyfriend bought me three bunches of flowers out of the blue so my house is full of Gerber Daisies now.  Can't remember the last time I had flowers in here and I think it was five years ago that someone gave them to me.  So that's nice.
Triumph: I cleaned my house!.Struggle: Work is stressful right now. I had to tell a great employee some not great news today and I'm now nervous she will quit. Meeting with her again tomorrow and I'm trying to stay positive!.General: Since I quit drinking and stopped taking my ambien so regularly I've had bizarre vivid dreams. They are the kinds of dreams that you think about all day sometimes revisiting a few weeks later. At least my assistant gets a good story every morning :). 
**Triumph:** I went on my first Christmas night out of the year and didn't drink (it was never in doubt I was driving). The waiting staff noticed and offered me a selection of posh soft drinks to choose from...**Struggle:** I finally have some money to invest into my business which is a new problem for me: Making sure I spend it wisely for best return.....**General:** Holiday party survival tip: Take a trombone and play carols!
Having a tough week. Can't take my ADHD meds anymore because they gave me a seizure (after teasing me by improving every other aspect of my life for a month first) ..Also I work in a center for child sexual offenders. A kid got a tumor and Is likely not going to make it. A girl I had started seeing at work said "good I hope he dies rapists should all die" and proceeded to chew me out over thirty all caps texts. Won't give me back my coffee thermos I left at her place and now work will be Awkward. I mean crazy bullet dodged but it's still upsetting to me...Plus the ambulance and ER bills add up QUICK. ..Good: this Saturday will be day 100 since I quit drinking and ALL 3 of my college roommates/best friends ever will be in town to help me celebrate after months apart ..
Triumph - I joined this community today. ..Struggle- I am newly sober again &amp; dealing with all of the feelings that come with relapse has been difficult. ..General - I'm thankful for my loving family &amp; beautiful children.  My career has really on the upswing so that is wonderful too.  I'm full of gratitude for my sobriety today.
