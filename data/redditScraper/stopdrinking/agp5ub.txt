Backstory I binged all December. It all started when a family member gave me a bottle of Whiskey as a gift. That was enough to trigger the whiskey demon within me and I stayed buzzed/drunk for about a month.   ...I woke up New Years Eve:..* missing a pinky toe and a chunk of my foot. Still hurts.* I had taken a machete and chopped my bathroom door off. .* Blew through my savings.* Cracked my phone.* Had to leave work the following day because I thought I was going to have a stroke. ..Backstory to that nightmare here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/abviwm/the\_holidays\_nearly\_killed\_me\_trying\_to\_be/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/abviwm/the_holidays_nearly_killed_me_trying_to_be/)  ...So I busted out a pen and paper and created a taper plan. Long story short slowly went from 20-25 drinks a day down to eventually 2 then 1 then 0. I have had a couple of few beers since then but kept it at 1 beer per sitting made it last an hour and then switched to water. So I've been making slow but steady progress.   ...**AND THEN SUDDENLY THE EVIL CLOWN EMERGED FROM THE DARK TO REMIND ME OF HIS MALEVOLENT PRESENCE IN MY SHADOW....**  ...This past weekend I go to a company party (a delayed XMAS party). My secret santa employee gives me... ....*Any guesses?!* ..&amp;#x200B;..**A bottle of Jack Daniels and two fine drinking glasses.** ..&amp;#x200B;..I laughed at out of amazement out of the irony of the universe and chose to perceive this as a challenge to my will. ..I got home opened the bottle took a sniff.....  ...And poured the entire bottle down the sink slowly deliberately. Watching each golden bead of evil nectar swirl into oblivion. All while chanting maniacal things like:  ..."I have defeated you."  ."I do not need you to relax."  ."I am aware of your game."  ."I am stronger than you will ever be"  ."Alcohol no longer has control over me"..&amp;#x200B;..Literally screaming at a whiskey bottle. LOL - must have looked insane.   .I threw the bottle away and gave the glass set to my neighbors. ..&amp;#x200B;..*That was one of the most empowering feelings I have ever had.*   .I'm still not perfect I haven't maintained a true 0 day streak yet. But I am a far cry from where I was and each day moving closer. ..I've also been doing subliminal hypnosis tracks for alcohol and it occurred to me that those phrases may be embedded in the recording because I've never said or heard them before (consciously)   ...I still struggle with the evenings I have nocturnal mania - when midnight hits I feel the urge to just do all the stupid shit in the world. I am slowly bringing that in control with CBD and meditation. ..&amp;#x200B;..I believe the secret to defeating this evil clown is changing our beliefs about it even if it means screaming your new beliefs into an empty bottle (that you poured out).   ...Tonight I will drink iced tea with CBD and visualize further reclaiming my power over the evil clown.   ...Just wanted to share best wishes to you all.   ...&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;

You did it! You ate stronger than you think and you proved it. Keep on keeping on. You've got this. Iwndwy!
Wow.  That's quite a story.  Congrats for tapering down to zero and beginning again.  IWNDWYT
Congratulations on your achievement I never could get the taper to work for me. I highly suggest getting to a psychiatrist and seeing if you can get on Naltrexone to help you control the cravings or Antabuse perhaps. I also suggest AA for being able to talk openly and honestly to other people that are more like you than you think. KEEP IT UP!
oh wow yes it is like an obsession/possession. I'm glad you were able to access your protective part of your psyche and release that negative energy. Sounds really powerful. 
Ritual is a powerful thing.  
This might sound way out there but once when I was in the throes of intoxication i did hear a voice clearly saying have another. I'm not prone to hallucinations and I don't have a history of psychotic breaks but I was terrified. I did listen to the negative encouragement and am very lucky to be alive. So at the same time I have trust in benevolent loving energy. 
You're badass!
Congratulations I love the description used for pouring out the JD that was my poison aswell the smoky alure lures you in. I knew it was my time to stop asap when I could tell I was still drunk driving to work and all the people I was putting in danger with my actions. Stay strong I believe in you. If you mean CBD as cbd cannabinoids that will work wonders for keeping you from wanting alcohol.
This made me tear up... I am so proud of you for doing that!! You are strong you are doing it! Keep going! IWNDWYT 
Fantastic job!! Whiskey is also my drink of choice and always resulted in a lot of personal injury......are you missing an entire pinky toe?
Take it one day at a time Iwndwyt
I imagine you screaming like [this](https://youtu.be/BAGb0i5abxc) IWNDWYT
Thanks for sharing your story. I have had some attacks of rage that remind me of some of the images you describe. Awesome work on using meditation and cbd....you got this TIWNDWY
IWNDWYT
I love this story :) 
Dude I get it. Embrace a healthy crazy. Soda water is your friend. It's gonna be a rollercoaster. But I've been assured it gets easier.
One hour at a time! IWNDWYT!
IWNDWYT 
Super proud of you. You're definitely on the right track. Sounds similar to my Story except mine was massive daily hangovers while climbing 32 foot ladders in the texas summer. (Dangerous)...Proud of you! Proud of us!
Which hypnosis tracks do you use? I use one I found on YouTube but I'd be open to others that apparently work!
I got whiskey for Christmas too...literally sent me down a path to hell. But next year I'll let them know no booze.
It sounds like you're making some great progress. Nice work!

Shit!!! That's some gnarly stuff right there. So proud of you for taking control of the urge and pouring that shit straight down the drain!!! Great job!! IWNDWYT!!!!
