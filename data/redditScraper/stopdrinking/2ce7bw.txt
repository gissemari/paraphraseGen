I've been hearing people tell me I should quit drinking for twenty years. I ruined a 15 year marriage and didn't quit. Washed out of university and got in trouble with the law and didn't quit. Began seeing a nice girl with a young kid. She hasn't liked my drinking but never realized how bad it was until she moved in with me The last straw for me was blacking out remembering a parking lot maybe a fight or did I just fall? Never found out. A hospital I walked out of coffee shop taxi. Woke up the next day and knew that was it...A week ago I went camping with our friends. Got to the camp site and set up the stuff. Made a fire and relaxed. Then out came the beer and coolers and (oh no) the whiskey. It was a five hour long battle royal with one side of me coming up with reason after reason why it was OK for me to drink. With my newly sober side relentlessly and carefully shot down each of those excuses as they came up. I couldn't socialize. I was trapped in the struggle for sobriety going on in my head. Finally it was over and I went to sleep...I enjoyed the next day but again at night around the camp fire the alcohol came out. It wasn't easy the second night but it was easier. Alcohol really wrecked the fun everyone was having at that camp site. People got angry yelled threatened each other with violence. Stuff that I've always done...Seeing it from the outside I'm amazed that anyone puts up with it. By the third day I wanted no part of it. So I think I passed my first test. I know there will be more to come but now I know I can do it. Thanks for listening. You guys and your stories have inspired me to save my own life by not drinking. Thank you.

Good for you! Crazy being on the other side isn't it? When I think "I wasn't that bad.....was I?" The reality is that I was probably worse. ..Thanks for sharing!
No drink no trouble.  If i drink alcohol I break out in handcuffs.  Well done on passing your test but try not to make a habit of it.
