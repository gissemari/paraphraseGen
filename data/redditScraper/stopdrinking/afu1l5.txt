Drinking has been a source of a lot of my problems in life. I have never been addicted to alcohol never had the urge to drink but I am social binge drinker. Whenever I am out drinking I drink way more than most people. In the beginning I was an angry drunk and would cause problems. Currentlymost of the time there are no issues but whenever I do cause a problem it's usually really bad and a lot of damage is done...&amp;#x200B;..**College (Undergrad) 2006-2014:**..I was a very popular guy and was part of a frat. This entailed a lot of parties and social events. I drank a lot and would cause problems . It got to the point that people started invite me less to these events because they didn't want to deal with me. Also a lot of people (who I considered my close friends) stopped being friends with me. My grades suffered as well. I would spend too much time going out and drinking instead of studying. I failed out of a very prestigious program that I worked hard to get into from high school. I switched majors and went to another school and failed out as well. While I was in my second school I got a dui. Thankfullysince it was my first offense and nothing happened besides being stopped it got pleaded down to dwai  (no misdemeanor or felony). I had go to classes and attend a thing where victims of drunk drivers spoke and drunk drivers spoke about it affected their lives spoke as well. It was a very painful process. After this dui and failing out of my second school I got my act together. I focused more on school and went out less but by now this had put a strain on a long term relationship I was in. Throughout college I was with someone and she knew what I was going through and was very supportive but by the time I was in my third school she had already graduated and been working for a few years. She couldn't take it anymore so right before I graduated she broke up with me. It sucked because I saw a future with her but I don't blame her for breaking up with me...&amp;#x200B;..**College (Graduate School) 2014-2016:**..After I graduated undergrad I decided that I wanted to get my master's degree before I started working in my profession.  It was a 1.5 year program. I was killing it. While I was in my final semester I was getting interviews with the top companies in my field. Things were looking good for me but then I got my second dui. This one was worse than my first one. I blow more than 2 times the legal limit! I was scared. I just destroyed my future that I've been working so hard to achieve and I am most likely going to prison. Thankfully I did not hurt anyone or get into an accident and I had really good lawyer. Instead of getting an aggravated dwi (felony) it was pleaded down to a dwi (misdemeanor). This second dui took a toll on me. It was much more worse than the first one. Once again I went to classes and had to had attend the thing  where victims of drunk drivers spoke but this time I also had an ignition interlock installed on my car and I had to see someone regularly who would educate me about alcohol abuse and would test my urine every week to see if I drank. At this time I was also offered offers from the companies I interviewed with but I declined them because I was too  embarrassed to explain my situation and was scared they would rescind their offers. This dui also affected my performance in my classes. I had to withdraw from one of my classes and retake it the next semester. I survived the second dui and got my license back and graduated from grad school and landed a good job. I vowed to myself that I would never drink and drive again. I almost lost myself after this second dui; I didn't think I'd be able to overcome this but thanks to my family and friends I was able to...&amp;#x200B;..**2017-2018:**..At the end of 2017 I was debating about cutting ties with a group of my friends because they were heavy drinkers like me and I didn't want to be around people like that anymore but I couldn't do it. I had been friends with these people for like 9 years! So I just made sure I kept myself in check. One night a friend and my cousin came over my place and when we hung out. We drank a lot and I told my friend and my cousin they could stay the night. Later in the night my friend got into altercation with my cousin. I broke it up but my friend wanted to leave and go home. My cousin and I urged my friend to stay but he refused and was being violent with us. I offered to call a cab or uber for him but he refused and was still violent with us.  At this point I had no choice but let him go (something I regret). He left and ended up significantly damaging his car and got a dwi. Thankfully he didn't hurt anyone or himself. He ended up never speaking to me again. Since he's in the healthcare profession I am positive that this affected his job as well. Through my other friends I heard he blamed me for his predicament and my group of friends (the ones I wanted to cut ties with) took his side and cut ties with me. This whole situation hurt me because I've been friends with these people for 9 years and I've always been the person they can count on. It took me awhile to get over this situation (I just got over it now). I realized that it's for the better I am no longer friends with these people because they don't align with person I want to be...I have a big family ( a lot of cousins who I am close with). We hung out all the time. Most of them are aware of my struggles and have been very supportive. Recently a lot of them have gotten married and some started families so we don't hang out as much as we used to but we see each other at family gatherings (alcohol involved). The thing is I am still single and these gatherings or random times we hung out I would feel out of place and resorted to heavy drinking. Most of the times things would be fine but there were a few situations that I was a problematic person. My cousins are still friendly with me but they have become distant with me...&amp;#x200B;..**Now:**..If you've made it this far I would like to thank you for reading all of this (I know it's long!). Writing all my past actions was very painful but cathartic as well! At 30 years old I am tired alcohol ruining my life!  ..I am tired of it pushing away people. I don't have as many friends as I did before but the ones I have I do not want to lose. I also do not want to lose my cousins as well! Also when I do find the right person I do not want to push her away as well...I am tired of it affecting my career too. I feel like it is holding my back from achieving my true potential. As can you see it has already set me back a few times already. If I continue drinking I know it will eventually mess up my career path...&amp;#x200B;..Starting today 1/14/19 at 4:00 am I am giving up drinking. I am scared because some aspects of my social life revolve around drinking and I am afraid people will stop hanging out with me but I know that the choice I am making is the right choice. ..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;

Whoa I feel like I just read my own life story. Pretty fricken close minus me being female. Thank you for sharing. I hate this age as everyone else is getting married and having kids and I am just getting my life together from all of the things I have ruined with drinking. Things are still hard but at the end of the day if I don't drink I am happy.  Good luck with everything :) I am here if you ever want to chat. 
What a tale thank you for sharing. Slightly off topic but I'm wordy so still wanted to point out: your particular series of events really seemed to highlight how "passive" of an approach we still have towards recovery (official tested you to see if you drank etc). I hope you can find some proactive sources for support on your journey such as an appropriate or understanding social scene AA this sub etc. Good for you friend! IWNDWYT
I was also tired of alcohol running amd ruining my life the beauty of each day. That is awesome you are quitting.  I wish i had quit at your age. I am 53 and wasted a lot of time  money and lost potential due to alcohol. If you haven't read any books there are some great ones like Alan Carr's Easy way. Also different support groups not just AA there is SMART recovery Refuge Recovery and others. .Sorry about your friend group amd Very thankful your dui s didn't result in harm like killing yourself or others.  I never got a dui but it could have been me. 2 of my adult children have and that made me feel responsible like they learned drinking from me. Alcohol abuse is a family problem and i believe stopping the line so to speak can have a positive effect for others. .Glad u are here i am new too. So far what has helped me the most is being here podcasts and meditation. I have a lot of work to do on self esteem and putting my life back together professionally its scary and sometimes i feel overwhelmed but i am trusting the process and have hope that this new sober life will be more abundant than i can imagine...... 
Sometimes we have to go though plenty of hardships until we see that things are not working for us. You sound like a person with so much potential and possibility and you may surprise yourself how far you can go without alcohol slowing you down (and obviously doing so much more to impact your life in a negative way). Get yourself plenty of support; sobriety is not a 'single sport'! I wish you so much strength!..IWNDWYT
I've never heard of anybody ruining their lives because they were sober...Maybe they ruined their life by doing things that weren't directly tied to substances (e.g. video games or gambling) but it definitely wasn't because they were sober.
Hey thanks for sharing your story. I do see myself in a lot you say. I'm trying to quit drinking as well and im terrified of losing my social life and friends or even my social identity. If you ever feel lonely i would not mind to be an accountability buddy. I'm searching for one because sometimes there is temptation of normalizing binge drinking for "having a good time".   ...Wish you the best of luck.
I can't recall anybody saying the night after a party; "I wish I drank more last night."..&amp;#x200B;..I recommend reading Allen Carr's book "Stop drinking now".  It explains some of the struggles you are afraid of facing with sobriety.  People like you for you not because you drink.  If they only like you because you drink then they aren't the best friends are they?
Wow! I found myself pledging not to drink for the rest of this year from today!.Like you I am not an alcoholic but drink on the very few social occasions where my friends and I go clubbing. .This Saturday I blacked out the entire evening waking up Sunday to angry friends and angry bf. .It is scaring me how much my personality changes when I drink and how often I end up with a moral hangover....So from this day I will no longer drink not even a little. It has never brought me anything than strains on my relations. .From here on I will find new ways to enjoy the company of my friends and new ways of staying up late and partying. 
30 is young.  Be glad you stopped now.  As for the drunk ex-friend who blames his DUI on you he is a real loser.  Be glad to have cut ties and make friends with people who share your values.  IwnDWYT
As an FYI for you on this journey my three best friends from college all quit drinking. I like hanging out with them even more now than I did before even though I (and most of my friends) still drink. If anyone cuts ties with you because you're not drinking that's their loss not yours! 
Good for you brother! I'm in the same boat and starting right around the same time as you. Good luck you got this!..IWNDWYT!
Good for you for stopping at 30. My drinking was a minor problem before my 30s when it escalated to a major problem that took me years to get over. I also think most of my development into my adult self happened in my 30s and now my early 40s. You can't change the past but you're taking control of the future! Sounds like you have a successful career ahead of you. And with your new sober super powers the rest of life will fall into place with new friends and family as well as the old ones remaining. ..Getting a day counter badge here was very helpful to me. Checking in here every day helped a lot in taking it one day at a time. I hope you keep posting stories of your progress. I will not drink with you today.
Welcome and great job in taking the first step! It's not easy but it does get easier and probably faster than you might think. I found the first week to be the most challenging because you're fighting the battle on two fronts - the physical and the mental - but it has really helped me to take it day by day. ..Whenever you're struggling come back to this sub and re-read your post; remember why you're doing this. I know this borders on being a cringe-y motivational poster but it's true: you're not *giving up* something (alcohol) you're *gaining* something (sobriety which will make for a better life in almost every conceivable way). As others have pointed out you're never going to wake up and think "damn I regret being sober last night" but that can be hard to remember in the moment. ..IWNDWYT!
Thank you all for your kind words support and advice. It really means a lot to me. I am so thankful I found this community. It reaffirms that the choice I am making is the right one! I will continue to visit this subreddit and update you guys on my status.
You might be an alcoholic. Alcoholics don't necessarily drink every day or feel the physical symptoms. But an alcoholic let's alcohol destroy his life and will take away everything in the world he loves...For where you're at now get into inpatient treatment. No insurance can't take time off of work whatever... bow to one of those excuses... and then think about where your life goes from here. If you could "fix" it you already would have.
