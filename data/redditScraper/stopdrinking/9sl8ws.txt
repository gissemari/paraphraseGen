Hey r/stopdrinking..I'm having a lot of trouble remaining sober right now. The last few days I've been taking it minute by minute not to pick up a drink. I have 6.5 months sober and could really use some kind words or support right now! ..Thanks :)

Just keep going! Keep busy with some distraction or something. Youre doing good!
Could it be linked to PAWS? Or is there something going on in your life that is difficult to cope with?..Personally I always find it helps if I have an idea of the reason behind the craving then you can focus on solving the root cause rather than trying to resist the urge to 'medicate' with drink. Weirdly it is much easier!..You are doing so well I find it very inspirational that people have reached these amazing milestones of 6 months etc I still have a way to go :)..Hang on in there go for a walk eat some sweets watch a film hang out with a sober friend.....you can definitely do it!..I wish you strength and IWNDWYT
To me time sober sometimes feels like waves. When days are tough and cravings are strong it feels like a wave crashing. But it passes eventually and a new one forms. ..You're doing great. Things are hard now but this will pass. We're in this together.

Don't turn back. So not worth it! You got this!
Bravo on your greater than six months of sobriety!!! Woo hoo!!! We all have our  difficult moments but  This too shall pass.  I have never had a bad situation that alcohol would have made better. 
Great job on 6 months!  Do you remember why you quit? Selective memory can undermine our efforts.  Do you go to an IRL recovery group?  AA SMART Life Ring etc?
