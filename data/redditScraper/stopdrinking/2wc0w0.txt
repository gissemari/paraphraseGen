I am newly sober (2 1/2 weeks) and I have a friend who is also choosing to be sober she has about 2 1/2 months of sobriety. She was struggling the other day and was talking about how much more fun she had while she was drinking. Her direct quote was "It's 90% fun and only 10% ruin your life" haha. At first this made a lot of sense to me because after all MOST of the time I drink it is associated with having an enjoyable time. After a bit of contemplation though I had what was certainly a realization many of you have had before; Any fun I have ever had while drinking (Meeting new people letting go of stress from the day or week an increase in sociability and confidence) are ENTIRELY possible while being sober I just have to work at it instead of taking the short cut. On the other had everything shitty that has happened while drinking (getting in fights losing my car saying things I was embarrassed by later ect...) could ONLY have happened with alcohol. I am looking forward to having just as much fun sober as I ever did while drinking and without the "10% ruin your life".

Great comment!
Truth to remember!
Huh great thought!
Awesome and very true realization. 
Unfortunately due to the nature of addiction it tends to be a sliding scale for a lot of us.When I was 18 it may have been 90% fun but by the time I wobbled and sweated into my 40s it was more like 10% fun to 90% ruin my life.
Great post and realization thanks for sharing!
Very smart thinking.
Great post. Alcohol is a short cut to social interaction that can go horribly awry. No shortcuts in life right?
This stuff :)
