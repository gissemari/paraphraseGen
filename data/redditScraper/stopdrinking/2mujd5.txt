80 days sober today. With the exception of a few weed relapses I've been sober (7 days weed free as of today). AND...I feel down. Really down. I assumed that getting sober meant that my life would transform and instantly become a million times better. I didn't lose any weight (food addiction ugh) I'm in first year of university so my grades have not improved and I'm as unstable as I was on day 10. However I know how much worse it could have been if I had continued to drink. The unfortunate thing I learned is that everybody has stress and most people don't even have addiction as a crutch. Personally I couldn't and still can't deal with stress and I still get insane cravings. But I'm thankful that I'm sober. One day at a time...

Hang in there my first 6 months were rough I was staying sober out of spite and for no other reason. Now?  It's worth it I can promise you that.
One day at a time. Sometimes one hour at a time. Hang in there you got this.
