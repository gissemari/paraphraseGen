She said "I don't want a dead friend." We were at my IOP and she came as a guest on friends and family night. The conversation and topic got really heavy and the counselor singled us out at one point and asked us to role play about why I'm here and why I'm not drinking or using anymore. This was a friend who was pretty much unaware of how bad it got for me because I lived out of town until recently following my last relapse. She looked me dead in the eyes and told me that. I'm so glad to be here today and to have her and my new friends in the group keeping me accountable. Every time I think of having a drink I'll think of those words. I don't want to be a dead friend. I'm not drinking with you today guys!
