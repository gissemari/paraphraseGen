Because life is still a little bit rough on me maybe writing the following down will give me some extra positive vibes. I guess I need some positive things to balance it all out :). ..-My dear friend is still in the ICU. It's been more than 3 weeks. He's a badass not giving up on life! I didn't want to drink! .- I myself had surgery last week. I didn't want to drink! .- Still struggling with family relationships. I didn't want to drink! .- Recovering from the surgery at home on my own with some help from my friends. I didn't want to drink! .- Had a funeral in between all of this 2 weeks ago. I didn't want to drink! ..So the not wanting to drink part of life is going well :) .Kinda proud of that. .Life wil be better. One thing I know is that drinking will only mess everything up. "Practiced" that way of "coping" for way to long. So I won't be doing that! Keep it up all!! .IWNDWYT .
