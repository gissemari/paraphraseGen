16 days sober after another alcohol relapse.  beer and margaritas turned into  and an ugly argument with a bartender. He had  cut me off.  Seems I cannot stop drinking if I am in a bar situation.  Always turns to shots or margaritas or something that ups the buzz.  No more!   If not for my girlfriend getting me in a cab who knows where I would of wound up. Probably arrested again. .Enjoying  La Croix now  I keep some everywhere. In my frig in a cooler in my car at work in the gym bag. Etc. all covered. Feeling solid and ready for the longhaul sober.  .Thank you all SDers. This sub reedit is a life-saver!
