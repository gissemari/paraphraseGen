Greetings fellow sobernauts! I hope you have had a great sober Saturday. The weather was too windy for me to go for my power walk today so I chilled out on the sofa and watched TV.  I read a good many of your posts too. You are all so inspiring and motivating. I know weekends can be a tad tricky when trying to stay sober. Thank you SD sobernauts for being here. I couldn't do this without you. It is the end of Day 6 and I am sober. Sending best wishes to you all especially those of us who are still struggling:-)
