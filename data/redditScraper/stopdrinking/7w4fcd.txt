After over a year in this amazing community I have read a lot of posts about other people's experiences with urges and cravings after quitting alcohol. I like to classify them as two different entities. A **craving** is the physical "thirst" for alcohol. It's the dryness on the back of my tongue and in the back of my throat. It's that itch that only alcohol can scratch. In the early stages of sobriety cravings consumed my being. They were strongest around day 3 or 4 during the first week of quitting. During early recovery I found that eating something sweet satisfied my cravings 100% of the time. I ate cookies. So many cookies. I could eat handfuls of Thin Oreos. Is eating a shit-ton of sugar healthy? Nope. Is it better drinking? YES. Now that I am 15+ months into sobriety I have developed quite a sweet tooth and my post-drinking weight loss has stopped. Now I have (almost) completely cut out refined sugar and rely on fruit in order to satisfy my sugar addiction. Baby steps right? Having a good non-alcoholic drink substitute is also a great way to fight cravings. My fridge is stocked with grapefruit and coconut La Croix at all times. Having a cold can I can crack open and guzzle is refreshing and keep my hands busy.    .I like to think of an **urge** as a more long-term struggle that lasts long after the cravings have subsided. An urge can be triggered by situations. Going out to dinner brunch holidays snow days birthdays vacations concerts etc. Controlling urges can be a lot more tricky. "Playing the tape forward" has always been an extremely effective way I fight urges. During situational triggers I often imagine myself the next morning if I decided to relapse. There is no amount of fun or pleasure I would receive from one night of drinking that would be worth that feeling.    .Urges can also be triggered by the Voice of Addiction inside my head that likes to romanticize alcohol. The Voice likes to reminisce about the early days of drinking when I was young carefree and when my body was more resilient. It likes to remind me of all the fun I had way back when alcohol was new and exciting. In order to fight urge triggered by the Voice's seductive reasoning I have to "remember my last drunk." I have to recall exactly how I felt when I decided to quit: I was miserable. I was depressed and anxious. My memory had turned to shit. My GI tract was a disaster. I was shaking like a leaf. I was bloated and unhealthy.    .Anyway I hope this helps some of you in the early stages of sobriety. Does anyone else have strategies on how to fight the urges and cravings?    .I will not drink with you today!

it's the difference between physical and psychological addiction. Physical addiction is the first to go away once you stop. For me it was over in a couple of days. The psychological addition lasted years - I still have it in me somewhere. It raises it's head when I encounter something for the first time sober - e.g. first sober wedding first sober christmas first sober funeral. But if I can get through the day the next wedding Christmas funeral etc it's not there any more. ..In the early days of sobriety the craving soon passed once the alcohol was out of my bloodstream my body stopped physically craving it - so long as I don't touch a single drop the physical craving will never come back. But then the psychological kicked in because every day brought new experiences to endure sober. Eventually the amount of new things started to tail off. These days they are few and far between and so I hardly feel addicted at all.
Hey Papi Great Post !  Very Useful !  And you've got a great Palindrome tomorrow !
That's such a great explanation. I found I got only mild cravings mostly and then the urges hit. So I avoided things that might trigger the urge for the first couple of weeks came here as often as I needed to substituted with mineral water walked the dog more - anything to distract disarm and dismiss the urges. ..They still come - only a few have felt overwhelming [like the other night in the motel room where they hadn't cleaned out the minibar] and then reaching out here has worked. Smaller urges come and go like houseflies - and just as annoying and unwelcome! I give myself a kinda brisk mental shake [or if that doesn't work a mental smack upside the head] and remind myself I don't do the alcohol thing anymore I mention to my strong self how much I don't want to reset my badge and how I made the pledge and how there are people that are really proud of my progress. I also use playing it forward and also playing it backward [either to how crap I felt after drinking OR how great I've been feeling not drinking]. I tell the Addict Voice to fuck off pretty much. I do my best then to simply ignore it. Ignoring it takes away its power. I know the urge will come and go possibly for many months or years to come - but this is a game of whack-a-mole I'm really determined to win. I am yet to learn how to be kind to myself in how I do the self-talk managing urges. It is still a reflex to be cross with myself. Perhaps that will come in time - right now cross is working when it has to. 
Thank you for this 
I never even thought about it like this before.  I just called everything a craving.  But it is much better to be precise in my language about it.  My best strategy was talking to my husband about how I was feeling and then he also stopped drinking.  I mean if it's dry people and dry places if it's not that way at home I am deeply at risk at least I was in the beginning.  Now we talk about the benefits together quite often.  I know you and your SO are sober together and I know the power of it.  I mean there's so much to be grateful for with just starting there.
I love your post - it really captures the craving vs urges struggle. I too play the tape forward especially the night before an event I'm going to attend. It always ends ugly and really has helped me through some tough urges. I also have an escape plan just in case I want to leave and my husband or friends decide to stay. There has NEVER been one time where I wished I had had a drink or two (hundred) and I am always grateful to wake up hangover free. I check in here almost every day and that has helped me immensely. Thank you for a great post. I will not drink with you today.
I totally see that. When I crave a drink I have a coke on ice and some Twizzlers. I feel like I got a treat and it helps. ..Urges are harder. I was at an airport hours earlier than my flight. I always drank before a flight so just seeing the terminal triggered my desire for a drink. But I told myself did alcohol ever help your anxiety with flying? Did it ever get you on that plane feeling better? The answer is no so I didn't drink. ..
So glad to hear that I'm not the only one devouring sugar in early sobriety.  I was hoping to lose a bunch of weight not drinking but I think that's out the window with my new sugar intake but it is better than drinking and I'm sure when I feel like I'm not white knuckling anymore I can start to do some damage control with it.  Thanks so much for sharing
Thank you. That's all so helpful and a great way to look at it. A craving is different from an urge. 
Brilliant distinction. I often see others talking about "cravings" yet I can't honestly say I've experienced many of them. The **urge** however is a different animal. The urge I believe comes from associations your brain has formed out of habit. They take longer to unlearn and they're trickier since they can be much more deeply ingrained into how you think especially how you think of and plan for the future. Thinking of the summer I imagine myself at a beach sitting at the bar or on the beach with a beer in my hand. I don't crave the taste or the buzz but I have the urge to participate in this process. ..Being aware of this is definitely a good first step. Otherwise it seems like apart for sheer willpower and identification/avoidance of certain triggers (especially early on) the hard work is in teaching your brain new associations new habits. Creating new memories for your brain to call up when it thinks of a certain place or activity. 
A lot of alcoholics suffer from hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) due to their pancreas over-producing insulin to clear out all the sugars from alcohol and regular refined sugars. This is why it's pretty common to see people in recovery eat a lot of sweets. In fact consuming sugary foods like cookies donuts and cakes can exacerbate hypoglycemia. A healthy diet helps with cravings urges depression and overall health!
So helpful thank you
