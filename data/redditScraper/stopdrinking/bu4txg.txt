I'm not sure what was going on with me this past weekend - I kept thinking...what if I just drink for one day? It's probably due to the change in weather - this is my first summer alcohol free. I was close to caving - even causeda small tiff with my SO. I was I decisive emotional and CRABBY. Then I just stopped and cried. I realized that I was struggling with wanting things the way they used to be- but without the consequences. Can't happen- is t possible. So I talked my way through it - had a nice dinner and watched a funny movie. I thank my SO for being patient because I was a real brat!.I did not drink and I feel so much better! Glad to have this sub to refer to when I'm in tight spots. IWNDWYT

Good job! Had a brush with temptation too so glad I didn't cave.
Awesome.
Good for you getting through the long weekend!  I struggled mightily on Saturday and Sunday being angry I wasn't going to drink getting depressed over changes in my life and then finally settled down Sunday and enjoyed some nice jazz music and reading in the evening.  I woke up in a great mood yesterday and wasn't even tempted.  Had my first sober holiday in decades and it was nice.  I guess I'm usually the instigator because my husband and adult daughter only had one beer each while I tried an interesting NA one (beer was never my thing to get drunk on so no issues with that tempting me) we cooked burgers and the grandsons swam.  It was nice to do all of that sober for a change.  The sub got me through the low moments as well.   Way to go on your long sober run!!..&amp;#x200B;..Edit:  grammar
