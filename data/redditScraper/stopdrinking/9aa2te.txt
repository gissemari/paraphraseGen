I made it about 6 months then tested the waters.  This past week has been a big binge.  I've been holding off today but my heart is racing I am starting to sweat and I am afraid of withdrawal so I guess I will attempt a taper.  I ended up in the hospital before hoping to not have a repeat of that.

Just be careful that the taper doesn't end up in another binge.  Best of luck to you.  
Welcome back.   Tapers are tough you probably should see if you can get some meds from a doctor.   
I got the supplies that I need for the taper so I won't respond while drinking but I appreciate reading words of encouragement.
After reading many similar stories I'm beginning to think that trying to "moderate" after quitting is harder than staying sober...Glad you are back and stay out of that hospital!
