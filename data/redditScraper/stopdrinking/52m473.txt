Its for dual diagnosis. I've been in so many I could teach them. Anyone else feel the same? I need people who truly understand my struggle. Its the same old tired information recycled time after time.

I've been in numerous IOPs and PHPs group therapy inpatient psych groups you name it.  What has helped me to get the most out of my recent IOP is:..1.  Remembering that I don't know everything;.2.  Fully participating in every moment - paying attention talking doing the exercises as thoroughly as possible;.3.  Listening hard to the experiences of others and finding the common ground/not dismissing people who use other substances have different life stories or who I find challenging;.4.  Talking to people during the breaks.  I still smoke so that's built in but other people in my IOP who don't smoke would come outside with the rest of us to chat.
Thank you. Great advice I'll follow it.
