It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-----------------------------------------.**Struggle:** I am back in Florida and the house next to my mother's is rented out. There is the sound of drunken partying at all hours the smell of cigarettes and dope constantly comes wafting over the fence and with the amount of people who come and go to the house our neighbors must be selling drugs. It looks exactly like the kind of life I used to live...At one point they had a beautiful race-ready Japanese motorcycle parked out front with a For Sale sign on it and I was so tempted to buy it. I really miss my single-cylinder caf  racer  thumper  that I rode for more than a decade but I'm trying so hard to live a safer healthier life. Like Dusty Springfield says in *Son of a Preacher Man*  Being good isn't always easy.  Actually if you ask me it's never easy. It would be so simple just to wander next door and join the party . . ...**Triumph:** I have not wandered next door. ..**General:** On Tuesday I had the pleasure of spending some time with fellow Dino and SD regular u/AllGravitySucks. It was a very pleasant meeting he's charming and quite handsome (but don't tell him I told you!).

I miss my motorcycle too. I sold it last year after I let it sit for two seasons unable to ride it due to an injury that never got better. I grieved for it and still do. Riding helped me stay sober because I would never drink and ride. After I was injured and could no longer exercise ride or do the other things that made me me I hit the bottle HARD. I'm slowing picking up new hobbies and finding other joys in life. It's been quite the journey. ..I hope the noisy neighbours tone things down so you can get some sleep. IWNDWYT
How cool that you got to meet AGS! Fun to make connections in real life. Too bad about those neighbors but good job not joining them.
I feel you on the easy/not easy. It s tiresome. Also giving in is just a letdown from beginning to end...**Struggle:** There s so much going on in my life right now that it s really difficult to get the alone time I need to catch my breath and lower the pulse. That spells trouble ahead - but I will *inhale grace exhale gratitude...*..**Triumph:** I was pulled over for breathalyzer testing a few days ago. I passed. The driver in front of me did not. Poor soul on so many levels...**General:** On Monday we received three pallets with 15 000 magazines that I edited and SaintMarge designed. It s the first big job in our new business and the first time we actually did a project of this size beginning to end so we were terrified to open the first box and see how it turned out. But it turned out amazing!! I m so very very proud of SaintMarge. And of the incredible turnaround that I did one and a half years ago - that you guys helped me do.

I'm so grateful for this today. Needed this right now. Came here to check-in and yay I can also process my struggles. \[TW for ahead\]..**Struggle:** My dad just came home for lunch and anxiously hoping "Modi comes back tomorrow" (Indian election results tomorrow) and I want to die. I already knew it would be difficult I knew my dad was going to sit all day and watch the shouting shouting results on LOUD so I made other plans with friends to stay outdoors all day tomorrow. But five minutes before that he told me he wanted to set up a big savings account in my name because he got a bit of money - I resisted and said I don't want it but he insisted. Now I feel like I don't want your dirty fascist money. I feel the same about my sister. What a great feeling the two people I'm directly dependent on for my health right now are outright fascist and benevolent fascist respectively. I want to die. It's another reminder that I'm not safe here. This is a clear PTSD trigger for me. Need to work it out in therapy...**Triumph**: I don't know. Nothing feels like a triumph right now. **But** I have therapy tomorrow and AA and I'm going to stay there. I mobilized what resources I have. A kind friend is letting me stay with them tomorrow till the evening. I'm studying these Captain Awkward posts on dealing with political despair while you have anxiety and depression and I'm going to try some of them for this context. 25 weeks sober and I'm staying here rooted in sobriety I love not harming myself out of a feeling of helpless rage. ..**General:** a 46-minute workout today. Wish me luck. Breakfast was a beautiful mango yogurt granola bowl.
Morning grom Nj! .Struggle: Not sleeping great yet.  I'm only on day 7 so I struggle during that witching hour: right when I get home from work at 5pm until about 7pm. The cravings are still strong but ....Triumph: I havent had a drink in almost a week so I'm pretty proud of myself .General: I'm tired like dont want to get out of bed and start my day tired. But not hungover :) .IWNDWYT
Struggle...2 weeks ago my life fell apart hubby divorce kids not talking to me ...next Thursday having surgery to remove unknown mass out of breast ..Triumph...hubby is willing to work with me on marriage now that I'm sober...kids except one are talking to me...finally slept 6 hours last night...had old tattoo with exs name covered with a beautiful lotus flower...feeling stringer everyday..and starting school on June 1 to finish my degree..have a blessed day all .Iwndwyt
Triumph: I went to my community garden meeting the other day to learn about no till gardening. This was kind of a big deal for me I get a bit of anxiety going to things where I know people as it is and I had only briefly met the instructor once before. It was a small group of people and it was totally fine I even asked some questions  and participated in the discussion. Of the 7 people there 3 of them brought wine to share because apparently wine is needed at all informal gatherings. I'm glad I pre-planned and stopped to get coffee on my way there. ..Struggle: I got my haircut over the weekend also. I do not like my haircut but that's not really the struggle. I had taken in a picture of what I wanted it was a pretty drastic change but I had my heart set on it. The stylist stopped short of what I wanted and talked me into going for a "safer" look telling me how cute it is and all that. Since then I've been regretting it I really wish I had spoken up for myself and gotten what I wanted. Now I'm torn between keeping what I have and playing it safe or going in again to get the cut I want but standing out :/..General: Long weekend coming up! I have no plans as of yet but I'm looking forward to a nice 4 day weekend :)
**Struggle:**  I have a close friend who is going through an unwanted divorce and of all things she likes to drink rubbing alcohol instead of just beer/wine/liquor.  She doesn't want to face reality and it helps her sleep.  I've tried leading by example talking to her pouring positivity and motivation into her but nothing works. I've also tried explaining that once she sobers back up her problems are still going to be there.  She's very depressed (which is understandable) and never smiles laughs and is always negative.  I've tried explaining to her that attitudes are contagious and that I want no part of that. ..&amp;#x200B;..It's destroying her kidneys though and she doesn't seem to want any help or to change.  I really don't want to wind up going to her funeral because that crap will outright kill you (regular alcohol is bad enough as is!).  I've told her that she's the only one who can make the decision to get sober and seek help.  No one on earth can help her until she's ready and willing to get help...&amp;#x200B;..**Triumph:**  Speaking of said friend I have put boundaries in place:  I was total honest and transparent with her and told her that I cannot be a part of her life if she continues to drink and slowly kill herself.  I'll talk/text with her on the phone but that's about it. Hell the last time she was in the hospital a few weeks ago her kidney function was at 20%.  I just flat out refuse to be around anyone that's going to affect my sobriety in a negative way as I want to be sober more than anything else.  I know that may sound selfish but recovery ***is*** selfish in a way and I sure as hell don't want to relapse!..&amp;#x200B;..**General:**  Been looking for a "recovery" job - specifically one with low stress.  I'm almost a month sober now so I need as few stressors in my life as possible.  Wish me luck!..&amp;#x200B;..IWNDWYT!
**S:**  Spent the day with the ex on Saturday.  It was our daughter's First Communion.  I'm still recovering.  She managed to manipulate her way into my house by saying that her ride wasn't answering the phone.  It was raining and storming and I couldn't in front of her daughter leave her out on the elements...All Hell broke loose as expected.  She placed her sun glasses and wallet/purse thingy on my counter.  That irked me to the core.  Then she wanted to smoke some pot.  She kept asking me for some even after I told her that I don't have any.  She continued to interrogate me assuming that I had some pot in hopes that I don't know...  I was lying to her then she asked me for money so she could get some.  Then she asked our daughter for some of her First Communion money so she could go buy some...My hot water heater is having some issues so I had to go down into the basement to check on it.  By the time I went downstairs and had come up she had let the dogs out and in.  Puppy had covered super senior dog in mud and had tracked mud all through out my house...Things basically went on like this for several hours.  ..**T:**  I didn't drink.  The thought entered my head but it wasn't really an option...**G:** Holy crap.  What a train wreck.
The house next door sounds like where I lived for 4 years. It was not as simple as just moving. I had my wife disabled and had to find a house to suit. ..Motor bikes. You have my blood pumping. I owned a Honda 250 twin as a 17 year old. I still want one but that will not be now as I am no longer able to hold a licence...My struggles. I am not well...Triumphs. I got all clear on bowel cancer check yesterday...I may have found out my reason for no energy and generally unwell after many years. Many thanks to a dear stop drinking member. ..Just for today I will be sober with you.  ..Your greatfull friend John.      
Struggle: I'm a stress drinker and I'm studying for the bar while looking for a new job...Triumph: I'm back in the gym after being sick for 2 weeks. I've gotten a call back from a recruiter. I'm 16 days sober.
Struggle: (File this one under a nice problem to have but a problem nonetheless.) Heading off for vacay Saturday and feeling challenged by sobriety because drinking used to be such a central element to my trips. Now every turn seems to require my saying "no" - drinks at the airport drinks on the plane margaritas in New Mexico beer in Colorado etc. I know I did this to myself by weaving alcohol into so many of my former experiences so I guess I'm beating myself up a bit too. At least now I won't have to worry about throwing up during a hike like the last time I was in NM. Oof the feelings of shame are real. ..Triumph: We finished redecorating our former guest room last night which we no longer need because we no longer snore to high heaven since I quit drinking and my husband cut way back. We did get a couch large enough to sleep on in a pinch but the bed is gone leaving room for yoga or just lounging. Some of the money we've saved by not drinking went towards a lovely piece of art and I'm just thrilled with how it came together. Oh and by not drinking we have the energy to get home projects completed quickly and relatively easily! ..General: I realized this morning I find it much easier to interact with my boss. I think my old drinking self just felt insecure at work because I knew I wasn't fully present and engaged. Now I feel a lot less like an imposter and I can interact with my superiors with a renewed confidence. It feels good.
**Struggle:** Trying to catch up financially. It's great being employed but being underemployed and unemployed for several months this year means maxed out credit. It's going to take a few months to catch up. ..**Triumph:** I'm adapting to the new job. I've only been there a few weeks but I'm starting to feel less useless. This job will take at least a year to fully learn but I'm on my way...**General:** Frogs are cool.
Sorry for hijacking this post.  How can I post on here? Thanks in advance
S: Feeling hormonal. Honestly my cycle has been a bit off since I stopped drinking and I have no idea of that's normal. But it's nothing serious so I'm keeping on keeping on.  .  .T: I'm allowing myself space to be "lazy/unproductive/idle"...which in actuality means looking inward noting feelings/emotional shifts and responding compassionately. I'm also reading a book about childhood emotional neglect that is validating my past/present struggles. The emotional work is anxiety producing but also feels so great.  .  .G: I've been thinking a lot about climate change recently...seems like my mind just wants something to focus its anxiety on now that it isn't about drinking??  
Struggle: I am finding it impossible to concentrate on work and I am so behind right now.  The stress of that is making me want to drink. My toddler has a cold and is miserable right now too so that's compounding my stress. It's very tempting to pour myself a glass of wine while I make dinner later and forget about everything for a while. I keep thinking about it. I keep thinking well maybe I can just drink less this time. It's crazy that I do this over and over again. ..Triumph: I feel better physically today and I have not had a drink since Sunday...General: Long weekend coming up and that should be nice.
Struggle:  Relapsed this weekend when my sister was visiting because I'm still in college and wanted to show her a good time.  Also got denied from my top job which definitely didn't help.  Definitely feeling absolutely horrible and really just sad...Also smoked weed again repeatedly...something I hadn't done for a long long time...Triumph: Saw my sister which I'm happy about ... despite the pressure I place on myself to be entertaining when I do.  Also got two a's on recent midterms so my grades are on the upswing!..&amp;#x200B;..General:  Have been seeing a therapist to keep me accountable missed it last week which I'm mad about but in general has been helpful.  Just doing the job search while still getting through the final months of college are stressful and I think definitely have been making me want a drink more and more.  Haven't hit the gym consistently either which is very new for me... past month and a half honestly and that feels horrible...  I'm really okay just dissappointed in myself right now.
SOOO glad when I think I am no longer going to crazy nights out however "fun" it was--nothing is more fun than being clear-headed seeing and remembering people not falling or losing balance forgetting less etc...Quality of life is totally better this way and coming up on my 500 days it's become my way of life so am past cravings. It's helped me to say no to other things too. Like such a big achievement gives me confidence I can also walk past the chocolate aisle (when I decide to) and decline dessert without feeling deprived.  I've outlived the deprivation and 'poor little me' syndrome...oof...Totally yours--keep it up everyone ...it (seriously) only gets better.
**Struggle**: I'm 28/M. My mother and sister have refused to talk to me for the last few months with very few exceptions. My dad is still in the picture and being supportive but he lives overseas so my contact with him is limited to WhatsApp. It's been really tough going without having family in my life. I know they need their space and my mom started attending CoDA meetings so I'm being respectful but I do wish I could have more regular contact with them. They just don't trust me at all unless I'm going to AA meetings every day and singing its praises (I've all but given up on AA after 7 years). Not sure how long it'll take before I can rejoin the family...**Triumph**: Training for 50k on June 1 is going really well. I'll be ready. Also my mom sent me a text this morning asking how I was doing and she seemed to be in a far better mood than she has been in months. Sobriety helps...**General**: I got back on my much-needed ADHD meds after a year of listening to advice from a former sponsor/people in the rooms. Untreated ADHD (for me) is basically begging for anxiety and eventual relapse. I wish I would've consulted with an actual medical professional before going ceasing medication and thinking I could handle it. My job is far too stressful and requires way too much organization and detail orientation to go in with untreated ADHD expecting any modicum of success. I feel really dumb but SO relieved.
Also in Florida here. Good lord it is toasty out today...Struggle: Going to WingHouse and not ordering beer or jager. I never drank shots during the day before and rarely drank jager. However seeing the dispenser at the bar made me get that insidious idea that I could "just be spontaneous!". Then I thought "ew what am I thinking? And how will I feel later". That poison is not touching my lips...Triumph: I have checked in here every day since I quit and I am working hard to rebuild my unconscious mind's resilience. .. 
**Struggle**: I am definitely over the month of May and looking forward to actually having downtime. I've moved in with my SO and we are having a hell of a time getting a routine going. We are still getting settled but there's so much going on that it's hard to find time to get the house together...**Triumph**: I'm getting so much done! I'm catching up on a lot of things I've neglected. Hopefully with catching up on these things I'll feel less overwhelmed in the future and just handle things as they come rather than allow them to build up!..**General**: Tomorrow will be 2 weeks since my last drink. I feel pretty solid and in a good headspace but one day at a time.
**struggle:** still dealing with a lot of anxiety which i thought would get better when i got sober. i have pretty severe generalized anxiety disorder which i have dealt with since before i really started drinking so i don't know why i thought quitting would automatically make everything better..&amp;#x200B;..**triumph:** i went out to eat with my SO last night to a restaurant known for their beer. in fact the bar manager came to our table because he heard it was our first time there and rattled on and on about all their new beers and stuff. I DID NOT DRINK! I didn't even want to! I sipped on my iced tea and enjoyed my meal..&amp;#x200B;..**general:** we got a new bed and bedroom furniture that i am looking forward to setting up. i've been enjoying making my home nice instead of ignoring everything to drink.
I'm not doing great today. I've had 2 drinks after being 1 year and 3 months sober. I've texted everyone my supports and have a perfect plan to get back and everyone's asking my why I slipped. And I hoe rly can't answer. Idk if I drank it away it was a mix of everything stress work love. Or just my crazy brian. Bc I planned it so I could drink and have just enough although I obvi didn't.  But I said after that I'd stop. And I did and I feel like ppl think I'm too strong. I need more help and I want it but even after all this time. I'm the asshole who wants them to offer it. Even though it's not on them.
**Struggle:** Haven't been sleeping well since I quit marijuana. On day 8 of no marijuana today.  ..**Triumph:** I ACCEPTED A NEW JOB OFFER TODAY!!! Finally!! I have been waiting for this for so long it is such a relief. I am excited to start a new position completely and totally sober. It's also offering enough money that I can quit my side gig! So I can focus entirely on this new position with a clear head and new motivation. This feels like the beginning of a new chapter in life for me and I cannot wait. ..**General:** Excited to get back into running again. Now that I will have more free time I want to get on a regular running schedule and eventually get back into training. I boxed for a couple years but would maybe like to learn some jiu jitsu and muay thai to go with it.
Struggle: I'm back on Day 1 after a 2 month long binge. 19 hours and counting! I'm in the stage right now where all I can think about is alcohol and that was always the most annoying bit for me during the first few months...Triumph: When I got home from work today the first thing I did was pour a whole bottle of vodka down my sink! I was also able to communicate with family members that I'm struggling and we came up with solutions to help. I.e. call when a craving hits .
I may be going to bed at 6:30pm... But I'm not drinking today. Nope. Day 3 down.
Struggle: I have wanted to drink all week. It seems like every show every friend every picture... alcohol. My fianc  and I quit at the same time. He confessed he bought a beer on the way home and felt so bad he gave it to a stranger at the bus stop. .I thought I would feel better by now and I did... but now I feel not fear again. .Triumph: I still haven't given in.. and he was truthful and also didn't give in. .General: I love reddit. I love this sub.
**Triumph:** My dad is visiting (without my wicked stepmother). We're having a lot of fun...**Struggle:** My dad is visiting. He arrived two days earlier than I expected. The weather isn't cooperating with our initial plans so there's lots of juggling. Having him here makes me reflect a lot on patterns of behavior and things I didn't learn as a kid--emotions boundaries good communication...
