So I had one beer last night with the in-laws. It's only 11:30AM and I know I have a Christmas dinner with family tonight and I'm already struggling. All I can think about is having a drink throwing in the towel going to the pub and necking a few pints. I've had one beer in the last two and a half days. Why does it seem so much harder to cut back when I'm trying as opposed to it coming naturally?   =/

your post title made me imagine we are all vampires and this is a vampire support group. 
When you find out let me know the secret. As hard as I have tried I could never ever just have a drink or moderate. I was always so mad/jealous when a person could have half a glass and call it a day. Or just not drink when they did not want to.  
hm.... does cutting back work for you ever? for me cutting back and moderating has always failed. i've tried it many many many times. a long time ago i drank rarely but when i did it was often a lot. but after i learned to drink regularly all subsequent attempts to moderate have failed. by failed i mean i'd set a goal break it eventually (in one week or two months). i'd forget what the goal even was....
I've never been great at moderation of anything really. It's a huge part of my problem.
