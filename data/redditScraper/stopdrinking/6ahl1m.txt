Hi all!..First and foremost I'm so happy I've found this sub. Today marks my sixth sober week in a row and let me tell you that really blows my mind. In the past two years or so I've never made it this far. It's like 25 was looming around the corner as a hard limit and a switch flipped and now I'm here and sober...I do have a bit of a query though. I think right now I'm struggling to determine how I really felt before my two years of fairly heavy drinking. Since it started presenting in my late teens I've struggled with mental illness. Very severe anxiety and sometimes extremely severe depression. Eventually a doctor alerted me that I may have type II bipolar disorder and without going into a bunch of gorey details I've accepted that that's a very accurate diagnosis for me. I was on lamictal and seroquel for a little while and I think it helped but I was still drinking and those meds really don't work to their full potential while you're drinking steadily. When I ran out of my meds I didn't refill the prescription and was actually excited that that meant I could drink more wothout fear of the two mixing. And then I proceeded to not be on meds for the next two years instead swapping it out for drinking with increasing frequency and volume...I think what I'm getting at is I know the alcohol was self-medication and now that I've stopped after drinking fairly consistently a bottle of wine a night for almost two years with lots of binge drinking sprinkled in between I can't tell if the inertia I feel right now and the crippling general anxiety about big world things that I can't control and the general feeling of just being low is some kind of PAWS type thing that will pass or if I always felt like this and just covered it up with booze. (I've had a cold for the past couple days too; I think that's controbuting.)..Any of my peeps out there with mental illness have any thoughts? I'm in school right now and this term that I've decided to become sober has been the one I've struggled with the most. Waaaaaay more procrastination which is how I always was before self-medicating. When did you know the period of time when the depression and anxiety and also euphoria sometimes was just mental illness problems as opposed to alcohol withdrawal problems?..(I'll talk to a doc too; but it's nice to hear what the community has to say.)

I have major depression and also medicated it with alcohol and drugs. When I gave up my crutch/best friend my depression flared badly to the point I needed to be hospitalized. After that I was very open to the idea of taking antidepressants daily and seeing a psychiatrist which I continue to do today. I don't know if that helps but it was my experience.
All I know from my experience with suffering from cyclothymia and GAD is that it's virtually impossible for me to differentiate between the issues driven by mental illness and alcohol abuse and withdrawal until I'm clean.  I had a nine month period of sobriety quite recently and many of the issues I assumed to be caused by mental illness were in fact caused--or at least substantially exacerbated--by alcohol.  But then I got over-confident and started drinking again albeit less aggressively than before so I'm in the process of cleaning myself out again to limit the variables that impact my mental and emotional state.  Alcohol abuse disorder is of course also listed in the DSM as its own mental condition and its presence along with the other comorbid conditions make it really hard for my docs to sort out what's what.
