Work and booze are non compatible I work 10 hr days mon- Thursday  trying to recoup the booze losses lol I quit 5 years back and the last relapse lasted a week I was a sad pathetic drunk nowadays and realized I had to get on wagon again. I know that I can never drink because I am one of those people who can not stop and have no control over alcohol ....it just takes over. Life without it is happy productive and yes there are stresses but alcohol never resolved anything and made things lot more worse.

It's amazing what we did to ourselves with booze.  We took ourselves out of the game of life when we drank like we drank.
Booze and truly living life are not compatible for me.  I was just thinking the other night how I would get drunk and want to be alone with my thoughts.  That is so unappealing now.  My thoughts aren't as dark now as when I was drinking too.  Happier healthier and a bit wiser?!?
Alcoholism is chronic; it goes into remission but we are never cured. You proved it as many others have. Glad you made it back.
Congrats on stopping again...I know I really wonder why I drank when it really wasn't even enjoyable and either was a waste of time or caused problems.  ..&gt; there are stresses but alcohol never resolved anything and made things lot more worse..This is so true!
