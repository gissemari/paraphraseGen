I had an interesting conversation with my wife this evening talking through a depressive episode on my part. She suggested (as many others have in the past) that while I'm inclined to go inward and ruminate during difficult times maybe I could try volunteering or helping others. I've considered this before but tonight something clicked. ..Who would I help given my social anxiety? What can I possibly bring to the table? I thought long and hard about this question and thought about people I would like to help. And I realized it's others who struggle with addiction. Not only would I take pleasure in helping people who are dealing with something I understand rather well but I think I could do this with passion and a true sense of love and responsibility...Step 1 would be of course to make sure I stay the course and do some healing of my own. But this was a HUGE revelation. I'm not sure why it never occurred to me before. What could be more beautiful than to turn the most negative thing in my life into an asset by using my experience to help others??..I just wanted to share this revelation. I am currently taking steps to join a program for the long haul with this solid and achievable goal in mind...It will not be easy but if I can get to a place where I can help others who are struggling with addiction... well I can't imagine any kind of volunteer work that could possibly be more rewarding.
