I'm 31 days sober now and just had my first day of therapy. I have some pretty serious anxiety and self esteem issues and I feel like even one day of therapy has helped to relieve some of my stress. Drinking was making it so much worse and quitting has helped immensely although there is more work to do to completely resolve the issue. Just wanted to encourage anyone who is drinking to escape any problems or has recently quit but struggling to be proactive in your self care. It really does get easier with time and you can do it!

Sober On!
Going to therapy is a big step in the right direction. I find that I actually feel worse immediately after therapy; all of the wounds I was ignoring are re-opened. Thanks for the post!
