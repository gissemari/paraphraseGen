But I really struggle with it.  I mean what's the point of being sober for one day? I know in theory that every day sober is a victory but my liver and my life are not going to thank me for a single day.  So on my sober days I tell myself  one day at a time  but then myself says back  Yeah but then what?  It's not like tomorrow's going to be any easier.   I know you're going to say that thinking about tomorrow isn't focusing on today but when I'm in the throes of battling over that beer or not skipping it  just for today  doesn't seem very helpful if the thought process is that I'm just going to drink it tomorrow.  Might as well end my misery and drink it now.  (Badge is incorrect. I'm actually on day 5.  I'm only able to string together about a week at a time and then the above battle ensues).  Any help in being able to better grasp this shit would be sincerely appreciated.

Today is all I have to work with. I can't do anything about next Thursday because it's not next Thursday yet. I may never even see next Thursday as there may be a meteor or lightning or a wayward bus. If I focus on today and don't drink today I'm being realistic and dealing with things as they are right now rather than trying to deal with a fantasy. Any thoughts of the future are always fantasy because they exist only in my head. Today exists right now so I can deal with right now the best I can.
One day at a time is a strategy that works for some but not others. Unfortunately it is tossed around like it is fact. Many people are much more comfortable with forever and just being done with drinking rather than "struggling" with it around for the rest of their lives. Others are comfortable with medium-term goals of a week month or year. I personally set a bunch of goals and use whatever will motivate me at that moment. At some points I have had to struggle and just stay sober one hour at a time. At other times I received more comfort from knowing I was 10 days from 2 months and then knowing the next 10 days were fine. The longer I am sober the more I seem to take comfort in longer sobriety goals. I have no intention of turning the rest of my life into some epic struggle over whether I will drink each day.
Well you've captured the essence of the dilemma...&gt;I get the one day at a time thing in theory..It's not about thinking about it understanding it grasping the "theory".  It **Is** about the *Action*.  ..Here's an analogy - "I get the theory of golf" - hit the ball and get it into the hole in the fewest hits possible...Pretty simple!  ..Now I just have to **apply** that.  I do that by practice.  Each day I practice "golf" I get better at it.  ..It's about me "doing" it not "thinking" about it...&gt;but then myself says back "yeah but then what?  It's not like tomorrow's going to be any easier."..Ah..... that is however a **lie** my mind tells me!  If I say "thank you for the lie; I'll just be sober today".  After a while I experience that is indeed **easier** and my mind can no longer use that lie...It will look for another lie.  That's OK.  Each day I don't drink the strength of the voice of the lie gets weaker and weaker.  Eventually that voice DIES...Whadda ya think?
I don't think it suits everyone and that includes me.Different methods or ways fit different people in my opinion.My decision is I will never drink again.Period.I don't give a rat's ass what I feel like or what my brain saysI am not drinking todaytomorrow or next year.I deal with urges when they come as well as different situations.But the thought of having to make the decision to not drink each day scares me.No thanks.I am a non-drinker. 
I have the long-game in my sights. Having considered how alcoholic family members have either quit or not; having compared my drinking years to the previous sober years; looking ahead and thinking how I would like life to be; it all points for me at not drinking ever again. Not "just one" on special occasions sometime in the future not "only on Fridays after 5pm once I've done a year sober" not "at my Kiddo's 21st" none of that. And I have chosen to look at each day's individual challenge as "I am not going to have the first drink". ..It's just that one drink I am NOT going to have which stops any of the others that would almost certainly follow from getting anywhere near me. It's something I had read a few of the long-term sobernauts here say - including the wonderful /u/Prevenient_grace - and I find it easier to get my head around than thinking in terms of time. .
My plan is to build a "foundation" of sobriety for my new life to grow on.  Each day of sobriety is a stone in that foundation.  No one stone (or day) is that important but together they create a firm platform for new perspectives new decisions new growth.  I am willing to keep doing it one day at a time because I want to give this new life a chance!.IWNDWYT.
So when I was quitting I had a similar mental dilemma with this concept.  Don't know if this will help but here's what I did.  I lied.  I flat out lied to my own self I would pat my subconscious on the head and say  just not for today ok.. today isn't that difficult we've done this before!  .All the while I knew full well my plans extended to full on quitting.  I just did not reveal that to my  evil twin.'  Seemed to work for me!  I'm here right?  I knew my reasons for quitting.  I wanted to get a better life happening without the constant illness influence or dependency on booze.  I wanted to know what it was like to get it out of my life.  I wanted really badly to really feel that... that meant stopping.  I just lied to  myself' about the process I didn't mull it over much I held my cards close so it wasn't as much of a battle.  It was a tough first couple of weeks.  But that did not last forever.  I starved that evil twin into becoming pretty quiet about things.  That was my process.  
We read a piece at my AA meetings called "Yesterday Today and Tomorrow". You could look it up but the basic message is "Yesterday's gone no sense worrying about it. Tomorrow hasn't happened no sense worrying about it. You can only control today. Anyone can win the battle of just one day. It is when we add those two awful eternities yesterday and tomorrow that we break down. Let us live therefore one day a time". ..And just from the tone of your post it seems that you are trying to do this alone. If I had one piece of advice to give anyone who's struggling it's this: FIND A GROUP!
I'm on one hour at a time. It is hard seeing days and months ahead.
