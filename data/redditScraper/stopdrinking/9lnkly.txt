Don't get me wrong. They were a lot of fun. But there was a lot of heartbreak and growing pains in there too. ..My 20s got pretty rough at times but I can't help but feel today that I haven't lived too badly so far. I've made big mistakes like anyone else but I'm pretty tired of letting them characterize who I am. The process of quitting drinking moments of weakness relapses and all feels like a logical step forward in living a decent if not amazing life. I feel pretty excited today...Also not drinking today! That's for damn sure.

Happy birthday!!!      ..I'm curious if you were able to connect with other sober people in their late twenties when you were newly sober?
