They know I've been struggling with slowing down/stopping with my drinking. I'll admit I've had a few within the past few weeks so my badge isn't 100% accurate but this past week I didn't have any until yesterday. It was an especially crappy day at work and I was just looking forward to relaxing and putting on my comfortable pants and doing absolutely nothing. ..I got my favorite brew on the way home had a few and got comfortable with some netflix. As always my friends invited themselves over and wanted to go out because it's Friday... the weekend... it's time to party or whatever. I told them I'd go out only if we went to a local brewery (I emphasized that I did NOT want to go downtown) and I told my roommate that I was limiting myself to 3. ..Three. ..I wound up only having two. Closing time snuck up since we were enjoying the live music they were having. Time to go home right? Wrong... everyone voted to go downtown to enjoy the bar scene. I'm bad with moderation especially after I've already started. So what do these 'friends' of mine do? Order shots of course. Then they buy me a mixed drink. And another beer. The rest is history... I pretty much got stupid tipsy ordered a few more made some friends that I don't remember talking to and woke up today feeling not hungover but more ashamed than anything. Ashamed that I can't stick up for myself or say no when it's time to be said. Most of all ashamed that I still hang out with people who encourage me to drink when they know I'm trying to kick the habit. ..

Unfortunately the responsibility of drinking or not falls on you and only you . It might mean seeing a bit less of your friends until you have a better grasp on your sobriety.Maybe you can avoid bars and clubs etc and suggest outings like the movies or brunch.
this is a tough one because nobody is responsible for your sobriety other than you. it is nobody's job to make it easier for us. ..i say this from a compassionate place because i have the exact same problem with my friends and family. family still keep a metric shit ton of booze in the house encourage me to drink at every opportunity ask me to pour them drinks etc. it's weird because they are also the ones who hated the drunk embarrassing out of control me and told me relentlessly that i had a problem. now they seem to think i should be able to drink like a normal person. meh...i am not even going to start on my friends. at the end of the day i could blame them all all day long but it's not going to help me. i have to do this for me and as i said it's not their job to help me or make it easier or even understand. sure it would be nice but it can't be a prerequisite to my sobriety. it sucks but that's just the way it is...don't beat yourself up. try to use it to develop tools to help you deal with it next time it happens and go forward from here knowing you have learned a lesson and can do better. ..i am rooting for you and not drinking with you today.
