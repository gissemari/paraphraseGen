I've struggled with the term alcoholic for quite some time now. It's been hard to accept that I am an alcoholic because it has made me feel as if I am sick for the rest of my life and will have to carry that kind of stigma.. ..But this morning it hit me. I am an alcoholic because I have a certain reaction to alcohol. For me that is I cannot stop when I drink the first sip. So everytime I drink I have a serious problem at hand...I know I will have that reaction always. And it's okay. But: I only have a drinking problem if I put alcohol into my body. When I'm clean all is good. I know I can deal with *anything* in life. But if I drink it grabs everything good and bad I have by the throat and makes *everything* worse. ..I have problems with self-esteem sometimes binging on junk food list goes on and on. But right now I don't have an alcohol problem. This is an amazing realization. Right now I feel free.

I like this!    
Beautifully said friend! I won't be drinking with you today!
This is neat!  And I'm glad it works for you.  I'm still carving out what my relationship with alcohol is.  I drank every day sometimes upon waking up.  For years I ate virtually nothing and just always had my glass with me.  I don't have any debaucherous tales or blackouts or interpersonal disasters under my belt - only stories of me taking the leadership role when everyone else got out of control...I quit because my goddamn eyes turned yellow not because I am ready to face a goddamn thing yet.  I hope I can find some insight like you have done with yourself :) ..Until then - I am happy to not drink with you today! 
I love when people break things down into something that is easy to not only understand but implement. ..I am kind of the same way.  .I don't have a problem with alcohol because I don't drink it. ..And I also have a bad reaction when I do - so I don't. ..Love this! 
I am *more powerful* than **All** the alcohol in the world **outside my body**...I have NO problem with alcohol UNLESS I put it inside me.
As Craig Ferguson put it after long term sobriety "I dont have a drinking problem but I can get one really quick".
Very cool realization.
This is awesome. Saved!
Take the extra moment and savour that realization. Kudos to you my friend. I will not drink with you today.
Truth. I will never ever label myself as an alcoholic or allow anyone to refer to me as one. I have a million data points that show me that bad stuff happens when I drink so now I don't drink. 
I love this post! Thank you. Just what I needed to hear. We are okay right now :)
Bingo. That's how I feel. When I tell people I've stopped I just say: I just don't enjoy it anymore and that's the truth. ..If I drink the likeliness of shit things happening to me or me feeling like shit are multiplied hugely if I don't drink then those things don't happen. ..Don't worry too much about labels. They don't mean anything. Alcohol is an addictive drug which has lots of bad side affects. I had a problems with those side affects and now I don't because I don't put it in my body. ..Simple. 
I like that :)
Sometimes it is as easy as that. It's so releaving 
This really struck a chord with me. I'm right there with you friend! 
Alcoholic is a term that applies to a person when they are actively addicted to the drug. I used to be a smoker. A heavy smoker. I rightfully called myself a smoker. It took years and many attempts before I quit for good (thank you Allan Carr). I know longer call myself a smoker. I am not a smoker. If I had one right now I'd be hooked knocking back two packs a day by the end of the week. I'd once again be a smoker. If you're not drinking don't label yourself an alcoholic - it's self defeating. Define yourself by what you do or don't do. Thinking this way has helped a lot.
How you characterize yourself and "the problem" is 100% up to you and if it works for you and helps you stay sober God bless. How I characterize myself and "my problem" by the same token is 100% up to me so here goes. I am an alcoholic a drunk a big fucking drunk who has not found it necessary to take a drink in quite a while and is like everyone else here determined not to pick up the first drink today. I am not in the least self conscious or ashamed or reticent to characterize myself that way. I was once but I am long over it. It's part of me has always been and will continue to be part of me until I have been dead for three days. May all of you stay sober today.
Here's another way to look at it. If you accept that you  are an alcoholic and that you have this disease then it will resonate deeper into your mind  how serious is it for you not to drink.
