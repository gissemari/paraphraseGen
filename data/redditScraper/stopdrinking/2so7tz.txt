It's been two weeks since my last drink  and there hasn't been a day yet where that little voice is telling me that one or two drinks would be ok  I know that voice lies and it would not be one or two drinks it would be 11 or twelve drinks . I quit drinking in 1991 and lasted 9 years  I felt great at the time  emotionally  physically  loads of confidence .... That is how I am starting to feel again . My sleeping is back to normal finally  and general wellness is the best it has been since the last time I stopped . The only thing I can tell people who are struggling is "quitting one day at a time" is what has worked for me  don't think about tomorrow  and don't worry about yesterday  your struggle with alcohol  is TODAY    concentrate your willpower on that and life will be easier . I will not drink today.

Congrats on your progress and keep up the good work!
I call it my "thirsty wolf" and it gets nothing;) Its voice weakens..Congrats on two weeks!.
Congrats! Sounds like you're back on track. You're absolutely right about quitting one day at a time. I've tried to quit and failed and that's one thing that I'm doing differently this time around. I'm with you. I'm not drinking today either. :)

Two weeks here. One day at a time. These weekends are hard. Today was really hard...It's funny how hard some days are.
