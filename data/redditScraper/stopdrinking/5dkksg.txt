I posted a couple days ago about my fianc  relapse after 65 days sober he had a smaller relapse today but twards the end of the day we think we figured out what's going on but we still need to talk to a doc to confirm but my fianc  was diagnosed bipolar little over two months ago and was prescribed lithium about a month and a half ago he was prescribed wellbutrin for depression and was warned that if he started to feel manic to immediately stop the wellbutrin well we are still very new to learning about bipolar and what mania even looks like and looking back and based on what we've read we think he became manic a week after starting the wellbutrin without realizing it and shortly after that because of the severe anxiety an associate of his primary doctor prescribed him 50mg librium every 4 hrs which never should have been done but we didn't know so fast forward to this last week his doc made a condition for releasing him to return to work which was the librium had to be out of the picture and so he did a one week taper his doc didn't think after just a few weeks that he'd have any withdrawals.... WRONG he was off the librium two days when he relapsed the first time and then again two days later "today" so this as well as being pretty sure hes been manic for all this time. He has no psychiatrist yet he's on the list for one but he only has his primary which is on vacation till Tuesday so we need to make a bunch of calls tomorrow and pray this can get under control before further relapse puts him back at square one. Has anyone here been thru any of this that can offer any words of wisdom experience advice "not medical".

This sounds like a complicated medical mess. I'm sorry. I hope you get the help you need.
