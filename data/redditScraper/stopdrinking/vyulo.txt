I really don't think I can do AA. I just don't think it's for me. I went to my second meeting today (was told that 90 in 90 is the best way to go.)..Problems..* The reinforcement of "it works if you work it" and the implication that my doubts about the program aren't valid and are a sign of a bad attitude. (Huge red flag that's definitely cultish.)..* AA is the only way to get/stay sober. Nobody says it outright but it is heavily implied...* "I've been sober for 15 years and the only way I stay that way is by coming here every day for one or more hour long meetings" I'm pretty sure I'd rather be dead. I'm serious I would consider suicide before having to live like that...* "You don't seem like you've hit your bottom yet why are you here?"..* The extreme focus on the idea of God..* Feeling like I wasn't "AA enough" because I'm not also a drug addict who couldn't hold down a job and ruined all of my relationships. (Note: The concept of "low" and "high" bottoms was explained to me and I felt like that was a good explanation. That kind of tempers this complaint.)..The biggest of all of them is the lack of empirical evidence that this program even works. The only other time I've heard people refer to a book like it is perfect and without flaws is Christians and the Bible. At least they believe that the book was written by the creator of the universe. The guy who wrote The Big Book was just a guy (a guy in the 30s-40s. It bears mentioning because we know so much more about the brain now.) Why has this program been adopted by so many addiction treatment facilities etc...? I haven't been able to find much in the way of meaningful alternatives either. I think that's a serious problem...Most of this comes from the meeting I went to today where I shared some of my doubts (specifically about the God aspect of it all.) I perhaps didn't speak as well as I could (I think I accidentally came off as condescending which I regret.) Personally if I'm going to dedicate myself to a program to stop drinking I would like for it to be something I can do and have it be permanent. For instance I quit smoking and now I don't even think about it or crave it (also almost every person in AA smokes and if you want to be a part of their before/after conversations expect to be exposed to it constantly.)..Can anybody relate to this? I started drinking 3-4 years ago and I really believe it is a bad habit that I both indulge in and enjoy way too much but I find the idea that I'm forever an addict who will struggle with this pretty difficult.
----------immediate responses--------

My advice is not typical of anybody but myself. I quit over 7 months ago and I guess I was  a "high bottom" in that I still had a very good job and functioning relationships. I quit without AA though I went to a few meetings in the first month. I went 6 months without help from AA and was able to gain a lot of confidence experience and happiness without it...But something was (is) still missing. And from my understanding it's what AA can provide. It goes to the type of thinking an alcoholic engages in that doesn't have anything to do with alcohol; a sort of sense of superiority mixed with low self esteem. It also goes to the fact that socially you will want to meet other non-drinkers because alcohol so completely permeates our society. And lastly it's really cool that a group of strangers get together and just share stories which is cool outside of the context of addiction entirely. So I began the program and have been doing it for a month and have to say I have found things I definitely like. I'm not 100% in by any means - I don't relate to the God talk at all for example - but I do think it's worthwhile enough to keep going. And I got a sponsor and am starting to "work the steps" and honestly just the introspection you do is useful for anybody...So that's my take! Overall I'd say keep going for awhile you're brand new to sobriety it's worth it for yourself to give it a shot to develop a fully informed opinion. Oh and finally - congratulations! Quitting is the best decision you've ever made. 
Yup that's the stuff people don't like about AA. ..It works for some; not for others.  AA is extremely well known (at least the name; the method less so) so lots of people who are just starting down this path assume it's the only way (it's not). ..SMART Recovery (http://www.smartrecovery.org/) is good for me although it's not the magic bullet solution.  The truth is though you're really going to have to look around and find what fits for you.  Sounds like it isn't AA.
&gt;"I've been sober for 15 years and the only way I stay that way is by coming here every day for one or more hour long meetings" I'm pretty sure I'd rather be dead. I'm serious I would consider suicide before having to live like that...I'm not an AA hater but that one really gets me too. I know I need to make a life long commitment to sobriety but do I really need to make that same commitment to AA? I know they have helped tons of people but that part of it really gets me. My only other complaint is that in the meetings I've gone to there always seems to be some over-zealous guy that targets me. I know they probably have good intentions but it kind of freaks me out.
AA isn't the only program! My second SMART Recovery meeting is tomorrow and I think it could work. I'm going to try AA as well and any other group I can find in my area. Look until you find what works for you! And if the religious bit gets you come join us at r/secularsobriety as well!
&gt;The reinforcement of "it works if you work it" and the implication that my doubts about the program aren't valid and are a sign of a bad attitude. (Huge red flag that's definitely cultish.)..It works if you work it means that you have to do the work.  You can't just show up and expect to get sober.  You need to work; it's not about everyone thinking the same.  Second you later state that you shared about your doubts (condescendingly no less) in the meeting.  OF COURSE they're going to try to convince you. I can prove to you AA is not a cult.  How?  Everyone thinks the same in a cult.  You will rarely find such a diverse croud as there is at AA meetings...&gt; AA is the only way to get/stay sober. Nobody says it outright but it is heavily implied. "I've been sober for 15 years and the only way I stay that way is by coming here every day for one or more hour long meetings."..This is about hope.  Not saying AA is the only way.  Ask just about any AA and many will readily acknowledge that people get sober other ways. ..&gt;I'm pretty sure I'd rather be dead. I'm serious I would consider suicide before having to live like that...If you're a true alcoholic that's definitely an option.  Not only an option but likely.  You **will** either get sober or die.  People come to love AA.  If you hate it in the beginning is that possibly because you're newly sober and you hate everything?  It sounds like you might be awfully closed-minded...&gt; "You don't seem like you've hit your bottom yet why are you here?"..I can't imagine anyone in AA saying this to you unless you've talked to them and tried to tell them that you don't need to be in AA.  This is what they'll always say in response.  Go do more research and find out if you really do need to be there...&gt; The extreme focus on the idea of God..It's not the christian god or any anthropomorphic god.  It could be plate tectonics.  They just want you to find something greater than yourself.  Are you the most powerful force in the universe? No? Good.  Moving on...&gt; Feeling like I wasn't "AA enough" because I'm not also a drug addict who couldn't hold down a job and ruined all of my relationships. ..This sounds odd.  Many AA groups won't let you talk (directly) about drugs because of the third tradition.  Also so many of the stories in the back of the big book **are about** high bottom drunks.  I really doubt they wouldn't accept you because you have a "high bottom."  That's a huge emphasis of modern AA: you're the only one who can diagnose yourself as an alcoholic.  Do you think you're an alcoholic? Yes? Then you belong in AA...I'm not trying to be a jerk but I'm sick of hearing this same laundry list of complaints about AA over and over.  It makes me think you either didn't go to AA or didn't give it a chance.  Try different meetings if you didn't like the one you showed up at.  Try NA (they consider alcohol a drug) they're a bit more liberal usually.  ..&gt;The biggest of all of them is the lack of empirical evidence that this program even works...I'm not even going to get into the "lack of empirical evidence" thing.  I can name quite a few reasons why the anti-AA statistics are skewed against AA but this isn't the time or the place.  You wanna spend 10 grand or more?  Be my guest.  Go to rehab.  Oh by the way the top rehab programs in the country are twelve step based.  Also if you try to point to cognitive behavioral therapy a lot of what the AA does is firmly rooted in CBT...&gt; The only other time I've heard people refer to a book like it is perfect and without flaws is Christians and the Bible. At least they believe that the book was written by the creator of the universe. The guy who wrote The Big Book was just a guy (a guy in the 30s-40s. It bears mentioning because we know so much more about the brain now.) Why has this program been adopted by so many addiction treatment facilities etc...? I haven't been able to find much in the way of meaningful alternatives either. I think that's a serious problem...People make fun of Bill W all the time.  Yes people like the book because it speaks to them.  But Bill was (IMO) a white-collar criminal who was unfaithful to his wife.  By all means he can be construed as a bad dude.  But have you read the book?  It spoke to me even before I was in AA.  Just get over the god thing.  Do you have to be so literal?  Can't you just replace the term god with "the universe" or what have you?  Look I'm no deist theist christian or whatever.  But I was able to find something greater than myself.  It's about breaking the cycle of self-centered thought present in addicts.  Finally we may know a heck of a lot more about the brain but there is still no cure for addiction...You **should** go to 90 meetings in 90 days.  Find a meeting that you like **the most** of any (even if that means you still hate it) and give it a **real** try.  This shit don't work over night.
I share many of your issues with AA.  I have been alcohol-free since January and do not go to AA.  I went to one meeting about two months ago because I felt the social aspects were worth looking into.  Fergeddaboutit.  I too would *sincerely* rather die than live like that...Just don't take the first drink and focus on living your life in a way that makes you not want to.
Hey there heartbeat. I'm Gilbert. I'm in AA...I have to be honest I don't recognize AA in any of the bullet points you list. Actually that's not true. I will agree that there is an extreme focus on the idea of God. But it's on the idea of God not on *a* God. I talk about God a lot but it's simply my shortcut word for a whole set of ethics and standards that I hold myself and aspire to..."It works if you work it" doesn't mean don't have doubts. It simply means that the program doesn't work half-assed. It's no more controversial than the instructions on shampoo...Did you notice that the guy that's been sober for 15 years told you what worked for him not what you should do? People go out of their way to do that because they would never want to tell you what to do. Stop being so touchy...As for whether the program works or not I have no idea...Your bottom is your business and the 3rd tradition says specifically who is AA enough. If you have a desire to stop drinking then you're AA enough and if anyone ever dared to tell you that you weren't then it would be that person who was not AA enough...Finally stop planning where you're going to be for the rest of your life. Why not make it to a different meeting that might be a better fit for you?
