Woke up feeling like trash and (of course) pretty down on myself. I've been struggling a lot lately but had been doing so well with not drinking. But yesterday I got home and turned to my old friend and inevitably went too far. Shit's a blur and I feel like I could crawl into a hole and die.

Hey me too! It's ok. Come dust yourself off alongside me and let's do get back on that sober choochoo. I'm personally feeling super happy and grateful I had the time sober that I did. I also really enjoyed nothing about the drinking experience this time. What say we use the time we had sober and apply that knowledge to get some sobriety earning dividens?
I was right there with you a few days ago. We fall down we get back up. One slip doesn't have to be a fall down the rabbit hole. Lots of love to you. Electrolytes. Sleep. xoxo
Brush yourself off and get back on the cart. From my reading here it sounds like it takes a lot of people a few tries before it sticks. You'll get it as long as you keep at it and stay vigilant.
Glad your back! Don't crawl into that hole come hang out with us in SD. Hopefully this will be a learning experience as to what not to do when you those struggles come up. Sometimes we have to do it a few times before it sticks but keep coming back.
