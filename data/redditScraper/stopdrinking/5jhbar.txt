It's not worth it. There is no such thing as one more time I'll work on this later or I have this under control. I made it six months a little under a year ago only to fall back down. I let my guard down I thought I could handle it. No adduct can handle it. It will destroy you on the inside. As of today I destroyed a 3 year relationship. I never learned to value myself love myself or how to generally live life on my own terms. I let relationships social media drugs and my inner self hate dictate the direction of my life. Tomorrow I go back to intake and  work out the final weeks of a shattered relationship. I have been running from my problems for too long. My mental health my issues with family members my self hate my childhood traumas. I thought if I just kept on using then things would seem fine but that is very far from the truth. I dug the hole deeper and deeper into my emotional issues. I was unlovable because I could never truly love and take care of myself. It's never worth it. In a matter of seconds all you worked for will be gone. The process starts long before you get high or drink. My emotional relapse started months before I started using again. I ignored them I didn't take them seriously. Your emotions matter! No matter how hard you work or how smart you think you are if your emotions are not kept in check you will just fall back down. Please it is not worth it. Get help now please. It will all be out of control faster than you ever imagined. You can't do this alone you need help. I wish I got help but I set up walls. I said I could do it on my own. How foolish I was. Now I'm back at step one devastated depressed and anxious. Please get help it is not worth it.

Rant duly noted!..Excellent observations...What's next?  Have a plan?
The best quote someone ever told me was "When you learn to take a compliment you learn to love yourself." Next time someone tells you something nice accept it believe it and carry it. It sounds like you're now able to self reflect and have clarity around what the issues are what needs to be worked on and your next steps. Wishing you all the best I used to feel the same but I focussed so hard on being positive self loving and confident and it worked
