I began my sober journey on December 1 and I liken it to an airplane that is trying to take off: each time I get off the ground and into the air I end up back on the runway. It's been a pretty bumpy beginning. ..Last week I had a pretty bad slip/relapse. It was only for one night but it ended up with me blacking out. It happened so quickly and it scared me. A lot. I never want to have to worry about that happening again...So I have not had a drink since January 22. I know there will be some turbulence but I believe now I'm off the ground flying and looking forward to this journey of sobriety...I look forward to being here and learning from everyone and hopefully offering support the best that I can...Oh and I LOVE my Smart Recovery group hence my username ;)
