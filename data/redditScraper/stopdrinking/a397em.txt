I moved to a different town a month ago and there is a lot of trust and freedom that come with it. Maybe a little too much. The thing is I am so much happier than I have been for a while. Actually extremely happy. But I have been thinking a lot more about drinking since being here. Yes I have moments where I want to throw it all away but it's more the idea of there is more chance for a slip by people asking me to get a drink or go to a party. It's nothing on them because the truth is there are people who can drink without problems arising (lucky assholes). I am at a point where I can be around people drinking but the catch is they have to be well aware that I am sober. People drinking around me that have no idea that I am sober makes my anxiety go through the roof. ..Simple solution right? Tell people if invited to an event or don't go to the event. It's just it's my coworkers and they are including me in something and I would like to get closer to them. But at the same time I have not gotten the vibe from any of them that they are non judgmental about addicts. I know that's a big assumption about a group of people I have know for such a short period of time but it's where I stand...I like that I am not labeled as the recovering alcoholic but maybe it's not worth it. I mean I tried this with my last transfer and was gifted a bottle of wine from my boss and was forced to expose myself under very weird circumstances. I knew I couldn't take that bottle out of the department because it was all going down my throat. ..I guess I'm just having mixed feelings about it all. I see positive and negatives of both sides but o course there is one large negative which is a possible relapse. ..If you read this I am sorry. I just needed to write this down to actually thing about it

I find that building a support group of sober people who get it is really important for me. ..TBH I don't go out often with coworkers anymore.  It has historically been very easy for me to be the guy who buys unwanted shots for everyone that night and drinks the orphans.  ..Now that I don't have to live that life going to bars to be with friends seems like a boring way to pass a night rather than a bonding moment.
You could just be someone who doesn't drink. If a coworker seems genuinely interested in why you don't drink you could indulge them further if that feels safe for you. As someone who moved and tried to shed my alcoholic label I fell into a relapse that was incredible delusional. I say honor and prioritize your sober self. It's been hard for me to navigate my identity and my story and how to relay it to others. At first it felt like maybe I was burden and ashamed I couldn't fit in naturally. Now it's the most precious thing I have and I say protect it make your story work for you and your sobriety. ..I'm thankful I got to read your post
