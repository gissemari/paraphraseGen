112 days ago I had no sober days in a row to be proud of.  The best I had ever done was 43 days and that felt like so long ago that it didn't even matter anymore.  I envied those who could get 60 90 or more days.  What was their secret?  Where did they find the willpower?  I cant say how others did it but I can tell anyone struggling that I just quit fighting the cravings and committed to doing one day at a time.  I don't dwell on when or if I will drink in the future.  I don't let myself plan a relapse.  I gave up on trying to figure out why I drank in a way I didn't like.  I tried for 3 years to think my way into better drinking habits and it never worked for me.  I started acting like a non drinker instead of thinking about how to drink less.  My default is that I do not drink.  Cravings still come from time to time but they hold far less importance they aren't as potent.  I can watch the cravings come and go while I assess why it came in the 1st place.  For me the cravings don't last they go away and come less and less frequently.  .A word of encouragement:  If you are struggling right now keep trying.  In this fight you're not beaten until you quit trying.  .
