I've been drinking on and off (mostly on) for around 8 years and it hasn't done anything but make life harder for me. The longest I ever quit was a little over a month. A little context to where I am in life: I've been married for almost 2 years to the love of my life. These 2 years have also been the hardest life has ever been. She's had chronic illness since birth dealing with intense pain that never leaves exhaustion inability to regulate heart rate or temperature migraines constant stomach issues the list goes on. Many of her issues nobody has been able to diagnose so it's a wild ride. When we got off the boat after our honeymoon her health took a dive straight down and these two years of marriage have been a barrage of ER visits long trips to doctors who ended up not helping or not caring medical bills through the roof etc. I recently got laid off and have been struggling to find a job. Rejection email after rejection email after rejection email. This is a big problem because we just bought our first house and we're running out of time to figure something out and we don't know how long my wife will be able to work because she just keeps getting sicker. Life feels hopeless. Everytime I can't hear her breath at night I panic because I know she could die at any point with the myriad of conditions and symptoms. Drinking feels like the only thing that momentarily makes me forget about all of that but I'm tired of it. I want to deal with life head on instead of numbing myself from it. I know I can take control and deal with life in constructive ways but I can't do it alone. So I joined reddit and subscribed to this page as a tiny first step. Thanks for reading. Day 1 starts now.

Day 1 is the most important. Stopping drinking is hard enough but in your situation I cant really imagine how hard. Try and find some AA meetings in your area the support and people there are an amazing source of recovery. Also just saying I would have never gotten through my first year sober without marijuana. I highly recommend it as a healthy vice to relax and get through really hard days. It's use in recovery is mostly frowned upon while in the program but to each its own. Keep it Up!
