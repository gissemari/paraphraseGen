I am 8 months sober from alcohol and was about 7 months weed free as well until about a month when I decided to smoke and have a few times since then. I'm not sure how I feel about the decision or how it impacts my sobreity. In the past when I was drinking weed was something I could take or leave and wouldnt really seek out but would use when others were partaking and it didnt cause me any issues. .Alcohol was always what I was truly after but would use weed when booze when unavailable since until recently I was underaged. Anyways a month ago I decided I wanted to smoke and didnt really think it through but convinced myself it was a good idea and kinda felt like relapse thinking I had done in the past. .Anyways I ended up smoking with a friend and quickly found myself seeking it out and thinking about so i feel like I'm just trying to use any means possible for escape now that booze is out of the question since i decided it's not worth the trouble anymore. .Kinda long but basically it seems that for me at least basically anything that changes the way I feel is something that I'm gonna find a way to abuse it if I allow myself to run free with it whatever it is such as caffeine nicotine and weed and booze so it's probably for the best I avoid weed to prevent myself from overindulging.

I avoid weed because the last 5 times I smoked I had to chug beers to calm my nerves.  I'm afraid to even touch the shit since getting sober because of that.  I don't really see a problem with nicotine or caffeine personally some people don't see a problem with weed so it's all how you view it.  For me I'd consider weed relapsing.  Basically my way to view me relapsing is doing something with the intent to escape reality I guess.  ..Caffeine and nicotine I don't think does that while weed would.  I also avoid any prescription or over the counter medications if I can but I don't see a problem with taking something for a cold or shit if I break your hip and take oxycontin because in such pain I don't see a problem though I would try everything not to but if taking it without a true medical need to I consider relapsing for myself.
I wouldn't consider smoking weed a relapse but I don't seek it out or use it as an escape. I can use it responsibly. ..Drinking on the other hand not so much. I would consider one drink a relapse because I know where that one drink goes and I'm not in denial anymore thank god.
