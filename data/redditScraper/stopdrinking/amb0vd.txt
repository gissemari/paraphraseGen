I'm totally new here and currently drunk (and ashamed). I'm about to fall into familiar additional (besides drinking) toxic behavior. I don't really have anyone to talk to because my. very best friend is also struggling with addiction and we tend to gloss over the severity of our separate but similar problems. I looked into AA but there are no meetings near me right now and frankly I shouldn't drive. My one pat on the back..I never drink and drive. But I do plenty to self-destruct. Please how do I start to stop?

I should have read the 'Welcome to SD' where it clearly states that you should only participate when you are sober (not me at the moment). That makes sense. Apologies for not reading and following rules. I hope to return if/when I'm sober. If anyone can send me their favorite anonymous online help tool I would appreciate it very much. Thanks in advance. 
Thank you for following our rules. I hope you can come back tomorrow.
