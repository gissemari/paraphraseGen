I very recently stopped drinking for 49 days and I just now (last night) finished relapsing for almost an entire month. Back to it again. I can't give up. I have to do this. I knew this journey was going to be rough but I had no real idea...&amp;#x200B;..I will not drink with you today AND I'm also going to enjoy this hot bowl of stew now and listen to the rain.

Welcome back. IWNDWYT. 
I'm back at it with you. Thanks for posting. We can do this. Stew and rain--two of my favorite things--they'll get you through.
I'm back with you too! I relapsed off and on for quite a long time and decided I had to make a concerted effort to get back on track as well. One drink leads to a huge rabbit hole doesn't it!? ..I will not drink with you today as well. Onward! 
Pattering of rain  -gorgeous sound...You got this - IWNDWYT
Welcome back! I've returned from a week long vacation relapse (as if making myself feel terrible was going to enhance vacation??). Glad you're back with us I will not drink with you today.
Round 24 for me.  If you fall get back up.
