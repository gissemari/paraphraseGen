It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-----------------------------------------..**Struggle:** I put all my painted-paper collages (which are very precious to me and represent many hours of hard work) into the back of the car to drive to the local art supply store to match the collages with frames. On the way a case of ginger ale that I had unwittingly left in the back of the car had gotten way overheated and while I was driving it EXPLODED creating a huge wet sugary mess. ..**Triumph:** I was able to immediately figure out what had happened and to rescue my collages before they got wet. Unbelievably none of my artwork was ruined! I was able to notice the disaster and act quickly only because I was sober. ..**General:** The writer Philip Roth once said  I'm like a doctor and it's an emergency room. And I'm the emergency.  Back when I was drinking this is exactly how I felt. But these days I feel less and less like I am the emergency..

Morning Mary! Thank you for the post and thank goodness your artwork was fine! ..Struggles: yesterday I had a strong bout of anxiety and found myself overeating (again).  Dog walk helped. Then I phoned daughter and asked her to help me get to the gym when she is home from uni. I need a gradual gentle programme for a fat old lady :-)..Triumphs: very proud of making a month sober. This time around has been much easier.  I am learning what helps me with cravings - this sub of course mindfulness mocktails candles journalling getting outside. Now need to add some more intense exercise. I also take a lot of pleasure cleaning up and washing the sheets!!..General: some days this change feels relentlessly hard work and I want to switch off and shut down like I used to every day. It is hard but it is real and true and I am grateful to be giving myself this chance to learn and connect and deal with the many repressed emotions still bubbling up from the past...IWNDWYT!!
*Yikes Mary  When ginger ale attacks...  Who knew the stuff would try and sabotage you.  I'm glad it failed.*..**Triumph:**  I finally quit smoking and I'm making it stick damnit.  After 15 years of quitting for a week and a month and a year and repeat I am done with it. No vaping.  No more nada.  I'm just not going to smoke no matter what...**Struggle:**  All the mood swings anxiety depression and craziness of quitting drinking come back every time I go through quitting smoking again.  It's one reason that this is my quit to end all quits.  It's shitty but getting less so with every passing day mostly.  I'm determined to not have to go through this again.  It's amazing to me how much more I have struggled with smoking than with drinking. I mean drinking is socially excepted and encouraged while smoking is basically leprocy and yet.....**General:** Thank god for melatonin. .. 
I'm SO glad you were able to save your artwork u/sfgirlmary! :)..**Struggle:**     I need to 'up' my program...**Triumph:**     Thanks to a very dear SD friend I've realized that *'I'm changing...what used to work is working less and what you CAN do is always a new opportunity'*...This combined with the 3rd Step Prayer have been very helpful :)...**General:**     This weekend is the 150th running of the Belmont Stakes. Town will be filled with 100K+ hoping for a triple crown. This used to be one of my biggest drinking/blackout weekends. This year I'm going to put a couple of $ on Justify and spend the day entertaining my 8 year old nephew...Yay!
**Struggle:** Same old same old. 15 years after my physical breakdown I m still not well enough to work full time. There are two interesting part time opportunities that I m looking into but energy motivation and self confidence come and go. I waste hours days months of my life crippled by fatigue and mental forces I don t understand (I don t *feel* depressed but display lots of symptoms)...**Triumph:** I ve known for a long time that I can t get better on my own. I ve reached out for help. ..**General:** I ve long since decided that when autumn comes I will not once complain about summer as we ve already had a better summer this May than all of June to August last year.
**Struggle:** Currently dealing with intense urges. Has been about an hour now that I haven't been doing anything other than thinking about drinking. It would be so easy for me to just go and get some beer...**Triumph:** Yesterday I bought beer and brought it home. I decided to relapse because "fuck it" but called a sponsor right before I cracked open the first can. He convinced me to throw the entire pack into the garbage and demanded photographic evidence that I had done so. I recorded myself throwing the beer away and sent it to him. I guess the money would have been wasted either way if I decided to drink it...**General:** Great weather recently sunny every day light breeze highs of around 28C. Summer's right around the corner! But with that comes sweltering humid heat and a metric shit-ton of mosquitos that come with it.
Good morning and happy hump day! It is good to no longer be the emergency. ..**Struggle** Just the usual work stuff. I got the promotion after all that drama. Now I have to take on the responsibilities. Meanwhile not sure if boyfriend will get another job and we'll need to move out of state. Still lots of uncertainty...**Triumph** Kicking ass in the gym. Eating lots of ice cream and other sweets and not getting any smaller but I was thinking in yoga class last night that I'm exactly what size I want to be. My BMI isn't what anyone would consider desirable but I feel so strong and healthy and I do not feel deprived or hungry with any kind of regularity. ..**General**  I remember a few months ago discussing with someone on here that drinking had been like a second job. I still think about that a lot-- how nice it is to not have to rush home from work to start the "poisoning myself" shift!
Well I woke up this morning and really wanted to share this so glad I saw this post: ..**Struggle:** I had a dream this morning that I was at a work function and there was booze and everyone was lining up to get drinks including me. I was at first troubled then thought well if I have to drink let me see if they have my favorite Jameson's. I saw the bottle but it was small and a woman had her hand on it.  Damn I'm going to have share' I thought. ..**Triumph:** Wait a minute I don't have to drink. It's been over two weeks without a drink I'm going to piss that away now? And I know that drink is going to taste like shit. I don't need to drink! In my dream I walked away and my coworkers had their drinks while I wandered off to dream about something else. ..**General:** First dream about alcohol that I can recall since quitting two weeks ago. I'm glad for this glad I am not thinking about it all the time and also glad that even in my dream I was able to resist the urges and justifications to drink. 
**Triumph:** I'm starting to see visible signs of fitness and weight loss. Abs and pecs for the win!..**Struggle:** My work changed up their insurance plans which means my copay costs are going up and I can't see my therapist as much. Bleh :(..**General:** I know Arrested Development Season 4 has gotten a lot of crap but I enjoy it for what it is. The remix isn't too shabby either!
Oh Mary - what a scare! So glad the artwork wasn't damaged!!!..*struggle* I am really not good at being ill. Because I telecommute there's no time off work [as not going to an office. means no-one can catch it from me so there's no excuse to stay away from work]. And there's no co-pilot for parenting duties. And I feel like crap. Oh well. Just self-medicate with herb tea loads of garlic and chilli and ginger and try not to overdo things. Put off until tomorrows what I can...*triumph* I made it through ALL the triggers in May with my badge intact every damn one. There is so much strength to be drawn from that. [and thank goodness it's now months until I face another trigger season - that being Christmas/NY]...*general* Loving the Wizard of Oz quote I have on the wall behind my desk right now - "You've always had the power my dear you just had to learn it for yourself." very apt for my now..   
Well done saving the art! ..**Struggle(s):** 1. Put a few pounds back on. Upped my workout intensity but working out while also watching what I eat makes me so tired. So then I overeat to try to feel better/more energetic. Ugh. 2. Have not been making an effort to see people so have spent tons of time alone which I oddly enjoy but doesn't really feel healthy. 3. In the meantime the warmer weather has been unexpectedly triggering and I have been thinking about drinking if not today then after I hit my year. I've even implied to some people that I will drink again after the year is up. :( ..**Triumph:** Set a goal to strength train 4x per week for 3 weeks. I am more than 2 weeks in and have met my goal so far. It is feeling like I am establishing a habit that I can stick to. Exercise help manage my moods as well as my weight and of course is critical to long\-term health. There are so many things I still want to do and I want more years/decades to do them. ..**General:** It's odd how I feel like a completely different person in some ways than I was while drinking. It's a person who needs a lot of work. Of course I needed lots of work while drinking too but used alcohol to shut down the self\-criticism and desire to be better and the cycle of over\-drinking and hangovers prevented a lot of forward progress over the past several years (or decade? yikes). As you all know not drinking doesn't solve all your problems it just surfaces a different set of problems to deal with. It seems obvious which set of problems to accept and address. Interestingly my husband (20\+ years together definitely knows me better than anyone) likes non\-drinking me better than drinking me and is extremely supportive of my not drinking (even though he still drinks). 
S: still very stressed about my job. Really wish I could fast forward time and get past this mess. Also having alcohol cravings at night. ..T: I met with two recruiters and will be actively and aggressively looking for new jobs. Also scheduled an appointment with a therapist to talk about my stress anxiety and how I can manage until I'm in a better situation. And sooner for over two weeks! ..G: time is just flying by this summer. Son is almost done with school!
Struggle - I have 2 days I'm unemployed and I'm realizing where I am in my life.  It's pretty scary...Triumph - I have a lunch with a friend who might be able to get me a job today.  Also got Allen Carr's book which has been pretty good...General - Ahh man.  I don't want to drink.  This feels like a long march and I'm scared and doubting myself.  But I'm here.
Phew here we go:..**Struggle:** Today is my first couples therapy appointment with my wife since my latest relapse. My alcohol use has come up so many times in these visits that I'm expecting to be taken down a rung or two by everyone in the room. But I'm not going to hesitate to walk into that room and sit down. I want to make my marriage work and I'm going to try to talk about what I'm doing differently this time around...**Triumph:** I got out late yesterday and did some overdue gardening. And boy did I sweat like crazy in the humid heat. But I think maybe it helped with my overnight sweats as I had my first overnight where I didn't really wake up with the sweats...**General:** My first out loud AA reading was section 252 of As Bill Sees It. For the sake of space I won't paste the entire section but it ends with:..&gt;For those of us who were like that A.A. has a very special.meaning. In this Fellowship we begin to learn right relations.with people who understand us; we don't have to be alone.any more. ..Oh man I read that and burst into tears in front of a room full of people I'd never met. In my darkest moments I think I really did want my family to leave me and to lose touch with everyone just to be left alone with a bottle. But places like SD and AA rooms have shown me that this was alcohol lying to me and that I did want the company of not only my family but others like me who understand what this disease is...Sorry long post! IWNDWYT. 
Good morning sfgirlmary.I didn't realize Philip Roth passed away recently (May 22 2018)...**Struggle** I done goofed at work last week and had to clean up that mess yesterday. It was embarrassing but it could have been worse. Things are super busy right now and I'm always thinking *I'll say no to the next project* yet somehow I'm taking on all of these projects AND inheriting projects from the other designers. I need to cap this before I get too stressed out and find myself yearning for the booze. ..**Triumph** I finally bought myself a pair of sandals and I'm really happy with them. It only took me like 30+ days. Pants/shorts are next on my list of items to replace.....**General** Dogs are magical. The little pooch I am looking after right now has stolen my heart and my ability to stretch in the morning it's okay he's so cute.
So glad your artwork was OK! I have had that happen before.. but it was cans of radler not ginger ale \*shakes fist\*...**Struggle:** I have been getting really irritated by my boyfriend lately (we live together). I honestly feel that the irritability is a symptom of alcohol withdrawal because I'm never snappy or cranky towards him and I feel terrible about it. I've been getting annoyed at stupid things that normally would never phase me. For example I get home from work before him so I usually start making dinner. He arrives home 10\-15 mins later and wants to help and keeps asking me "What do you want me to do?" or will start putting away ingredients I was using or start washing dishes/kitchen tools I'm done using and yesterday I just felt like he was in my space and I was like "Ugh! I don't know! You're stressing me out." It sounds so stupid and he was only trying to help but I wanted to break down in tears. I love him so much and he's such a good person it's making me tear up just thinking about snapping at him for no reason!..**Triumph:** Well I'm almost at 2 weeks of sobriety so there's that. I've been consistent but not obsessive with the gym and eating healthy which is quite the change from when I was drinking (had to count calories and exercise obsessively to counteract all the booze I was drinking!)..**General:** I need to find new music to listen to but I don't know where to start. A lot of my favourite music romanticizes drinking and drug use so I have only been listening to podcasts for the time being.
Ha! you created impervious piece of art! So glad you were able to save it. One of my kids paints and I know how devastating it is to have your hard work ruined....Struggles: My mind is such a defeatist and I'm really struggling to overcome it. "You are to old to change anything. Nothing is going to improve so stop kidding yourself. Nobody really cares so why would you deprive yourself of the only thing that makes you feel better" etc....Triumphs: Woke up early and took my car to the mechanic. Managed to vacuum the living room and move the bags with winter clothes to the attic. So at least I accomplished something today. ...General: I am my worst enemy. I would waste a whole day siting on my butt being overwhelmed and feel sorry for myself that get up and make a first step to conquer the chaos surrounding me...."If nothing changes nothing changes". I guess it's time to change something :)...   
**Struggle:** Been battling some depression recently. Keep taking my will back and deciding that I know what is best for me even though time and time again that has proven to be wrong. I am working now on putting actions first (journaling talking to friends not beating myself up so easily) and it's taking time but I'm making progress...**Triumph:** I am 18 months sober! Picked up my 18 month chip at my Monday AA meeting and it felt great. I got asked to speak at a meeting 2 weeks from now and I've never been the speaker so I am nervous but excited!!..**General:** My cousin is coming to stay at my house tonight as he and he's bringing his cat and I am 100x more excited to see the cat and I am OK with that.
**Struggle:** It's been a rough few days. A friend and mentor died unexpectedly and it's hit me hard. Losing him was huge but it follows on a friend's cancer scare and the death of another friend and mentor last month. My concentration is zilch and my frustration tolerance isn't much higher...**Triumph:** I've been falling back on yoga and running to help me cope pull my awareness out of my head and heart and into my body. It's been a couple years since I used these activities in that way. Good to know I still have the skill to do so...**General:** My friend would often challenge you with "How's your *now*?" It's a good reminder--and still a challenge--for me.
struggle: work stress typical life stuff. nothing too challenging...triumph: continuing to hit weight loss goals...general: anxiety has been acting up \- working through it. 
S:  ugh back to studying again for nclex and dog has some funky shit going on with her ear...T:  Daughter is with her mom.  Able to make some progress on getting my shit together. ..G:  it's raining pouring... storming actually.   Yesterday  the forecast said O% chance of rain.
Phew!  Close call Mary!  So glad your beautiful art survived.  I love what I've seen of it (hint: we'll take more sharing)...**S:** I AM DOING ALL OF THE THINGS. And I can't seem to stop.  I have boxes of purchases that I have not yet tried out/put away multiple yard projects in varying stages of completion a TON of vegetables and flowers that need to be put in the ground and oh yeah ground that needs amending before I can put said plants in the ground!  I don't stop moving from 6 am to 11 pm sometimes.  While I'm glad to be so productive I'm also getting exhausted and cranky.   And I've done it to myself.  Grrr...**T:**  I AM DOING ALL OF THE THINGS.  Looking forward to finishing some projects but I finally seem to have left my lethargy plateau and moved into the very energetic zone.  Trying out keto keeping up the running getting my garden going and doing a spur of the moment trip to MT to run a 5K on Friday night and then explore Yellowstone on Saturday before a long drive home on Sunday.  Phew!..**G:**  Can't wait until I achieve some equilibrium where it's not all house and yard projects all the time.  But this is what happens when the house you bought has been neglected for 20 years.
Struggle: I still dont have a car and I feel shitty for borrowing my partner's car all the time...Triumph: I got to hang out with a couple old friends again yesterday and played magic the gathering with them. I had a greqt time and we have plans to go see Birdemic next week at the local art house theater. ..General: Magic is such a fun hobby but I'm only like three days of getting back in to it and its already getting super expensive.
**Struggles:** got hurt and I need stitches in my hand. Not serious and I will be 100% fine in a couple weeks albeit with a new boss-level scar on my finger. However the stress relief I had from gym time and lifting will be limited not to mention the increased stress of not being as whole as I was a few days ago. It really makes me want to crawl into a pit of self-loathing and IPA's but I won't. I don't want to be that person anymore...**Triumphs:** It's day 11 sober. I've been resting better more focused attentive and generally more pleasant to those I love and I generally WANT to keep down this path. ..**General:** This last week has been really nice. change is slow but consistency for me is key. Willpower will get me far but I believe that consistent positive choices and a routine with healthy options will get me through the times of lower willpower.
struggle:  I had to exclude myself from a camping and rafting trip with friends last weekend because I can't handle the discomfort of being around a party and not getting wasted.  It's extremely saddening to me every time something like this happens :(..Triumph:  I got pulled over leaving a barcade downtown on a Friday night and was able to tell the cop "I don't drink."  He didn't even hassle me anymore and let me go for speeding.  This is after years of driving over the legal limit and never being pulled over once.  Thank you lady luck.  This actually happened I am not making this up :D..general:  I've got a 90 minute interview next week to determine if I'm a good candidate to take part in a ayahuasca ceremony with a local church.  Perhaps some god from the nether-plane will finally convince me I'm an alcoholic and to stop dwelling on the possibility of moderation :D
Struggle: Simply feeling very stressed over work but dealing with it unproductively by being on Reddit too much. ..Triumph: My belt is one hole tighter today!..General: I'm feeling pretty good about not drinking. Had a dream about drinking last night though. Still worried I might slip up this weekend at my parents' house but they know what's up and I'm decreasing my time there in order to try and cut down on temptation. ..Today is day 11. 
Struggle - I've somehow got into the position of launching a wellbeing festival having 25 other DJ gigs (inc 4 abroad) 2 of my best mate's 40ths and having to find a new place to live in the next month ..Triumph - this all actually feels somewhat achievable because of my sobriety. If I was drinking I'd be terrified right now and probably drinking more to hide from the problem thus amplifying it..General - I'm really filled with angst about the next 2 Saturdays. They are my best mate from uni and my best mate from school's birthdays - their 40ths. It will BAFFLE people if I am not the centre of the party doing shots with everyone and so on becoming a blurry mess of smiles hugs and sweat. But I am *really* enjoying sobriety and *really* want to maintain. I know my friends would support me but I'm just not really up for having that conversation umpteen times two Saturdays in a row. I'm not really sure how to approach it...Part of me wants to think I can limit myself to drinking at special birthdays and weddings but I don't know if that's true or not - I fear it could be a slippery slope back to where I was a month ago.
Damn OP! I'm also an artist and your Struggle and Triumph had me sitting on the edge of my chair. I'm so glad your precious work came out of this Ginger Ale Catastrophe unscathed :)..Mine were:..**Struggle:** I'm missing a lot of work time due to an upcoming surgery. It's very hard on my anxiety since I work with a commission system so I basically lose money by sitting in a waiting room for hours. It's also quite tiring to spend all day making sure I have all the needed pre-operatory exams and health checks running to different clinics and hospitals booking apps etc...**Triumph:** My surgery -almost- had to be postponed due to some of my exam results needing a long time to come out. But the hospital staff were true angels today when I told them this! They got help from the needed departments so I could go home with one result today and pick the other one tomorrow! I'm so so thankful for them...**General**: It's almost winter here and I'm SO happy for the cold weather. It's also much easier to think of winter-y non-alcoholic drinks than summer-y ones. So off I go to dive into a bucket of hot Mugwort tea.
Today was my first day back on campus in my path of pursuing a degree I tanked due to booze 10 years ago. ..Struggle: Walking around campus brought up a lot of memories both good and bad that I wasnt prepared for. It would take from "oh God I blacked out over there and my friends had to carry me home" to "Aww that's where I met my husband". It left me feeling raw and vulnerable. I found myself feeling insecure because I was in leggings and a sweatshirt and there was a girl who looked gorgeous in a spring romper who had all her stuff nicely organized (fairly sure she paid no attention to me it was just a red flag of "hey you're feeling insecure and it's probably not about your outfit"). While important for healing and processing that meant I was distracted and didn't get as much work done as I needed to. I'm super tight on time and when I need to focus I need to get things done...Triumph: I went to the pool when I got home to work out the stiffness in my body and spent a lot of time working with my foam roller and doing some stretching/yoga to help feel good in my body so hopefully I don't wake up tight so I can hit the ground running tomorrow (literally and figuratively). Found some tension in what I didn't even know was a trouble spot so it felt awesome to release that. It feels good to feel good in and explore the good things my body can do when I'm not trying to destroy it...General: I work 40 hours a week I run a part time pet sitting business I'm training for a marathon in December and I'm talking 2 classes condensed into 4 weeks (with a 2 hrs commute to and from class 3 days a week). So far I'm doing well balancing it all just gotta keep my head above water. Things ease up in July. At least I don't have to worry about what to do with my time. Just gotta keep an eye out for the "I'm too overwhelmed and just need to relax" cravings. 
What's up just checking my flair
You think I'll get withdrawal from being shitfaced for 3 days?
Struggle/triumph: I was seeing someone I really liked really had a good connection with him. But he drinks quite heavily and he violated a boundary I had set about drinking. I wanted to give him a chance but I didn't feel like he was being totally honest and up front with me about his drinking habits. I got too uncomfortable with it and it caused me a lot of anxiety so I ended the relationship yesterday. My sobriety comes first and now I understand more about what I can handle in dating situations when it comes to a partner drinking.
