Fucking hell I was confident but slipping one day made me snowball into relapsing multiple evenings. It wasn't even enjoyable but I just to hoped to be feeling something different. I had something to be excited about though the excitement proved to be unwarranted. Lesson learnt today I'm back on track. Already did a little exercise made some healthy food and smoothies read a little and will be going to the gym again tomorrow...It's so important not to become too confident. I just need to remind myself that you don't drink one day because that just doesn't work that way. It's scary how easy the old thoughts and behaviour come back once you drink a few beers. I'm confident though. I always do well the first days and even weeks but always lose my streak at around 50 days. Here we go again.. trying to get fully sober. The cravings and thoughts about moderations got me the last time.. I need to learn how to deal with them better. I'll be doing some research

Every step backwards is a learning experience.  You get stronger.  It's such a good thing that you are back here.  You got this!
