he came to rehab to get a chance to live again to be able to go without alcohol for one damn day tired of being helpless tired of being just a body at home annoyed that he couldn't be the father he wanted to to his 2 young daughters. he was suffering from cirrhosis due to long term abuse of alcohol but he was very hopeful he couldn't think of death he wanted to bring up his dear children...we spent 2 months together at rehab going through the excruciating mental & physical withdrawal embracing AA its first few steps opening ourselves to each other...he went home with lot of hope & determination. While i slipped a few times he continued being sober. It had been 18 months since rehab and he was doing ok physically now drinking only occasionally....but his liver continued to deteriorate and his other body organs also started getting affected. earlier this month he was feeling just about ok going through usual problems with cirrhosis but he passed away yesterday. Docs informed he died due to bleeding of internal organs...He passed away not being able to live up to his expectations especially the father he really wanted to be. i hope he breathed his last peacefully...this alcohol is poison it decays our organs and someday we are at a point of no return without being even aware of it until that diagnosis rolls out. the end is death with this disease. the withdrawal issues struggles to quit alcohol and all that is nothing when we compare that if we don't do something about it we will die and leave many hopes/dreams shattered/broken behind...guess that drunkard friend of mine is getting high in heaven now..
