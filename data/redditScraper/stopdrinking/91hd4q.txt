I was in a bad way yesterday and went down the list of all the healthy things to do decided against them and got drunk...I forgot how bad it feels how bad a hangover is how much it costs and how it doesn't make anything better...I will not drink with you today.

Sorry to hear that but sometimes remembering and learning can be a physical experience. Don't get down on yourself as we all make mistakes. Maybe this was just the thing to make you want to go 10000 days sober. 
Welcome back Man.
I suspect that your relapse started before yesterday. The pot just boiled over but has been simmering for a while. The relapse is the last thing that occurs.
It sucks that you relapsed but take it as an opportunity to learn and grow. I'd relapse literally at least two dozen times probably more and while it sucks and I felt so much guilt and shame I did learn a lot from it mostly that I am way stronger than I ever believed myself to be and so are you. Im proud of you for getting back on the horse and for deciding to keep fighting the good fight. IWNDWYT
I like how in smart recovery they say that a lapse need not turn into a full-blown relapse. You have not suddenly unlearned everything you have learned. Get back on the horse and ride again. Use this as a learning experience. IWNDWYT 
I relapsed again recently still working through all of the emotions and control honestly. I know I will get back on track but it is a scary choice and feeling to experience. Stay strong my friend
