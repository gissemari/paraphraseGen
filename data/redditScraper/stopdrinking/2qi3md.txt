Seriously I shouldn't be sober right now but I am. I posted last Sunday about wanting to drink because I had just made it to my dad's house for Christmas. I could feel the relapse coming I knew it was going to happen while I was back in Chicago. If I had a sponsor he would have for sure told me to really think hard about going to Chicago for break even I knew I was taking a decent gamble going into it. This was a real test of the sobriety that lately I've been real uncertain about. but here I am sober. ..As much as I dislike the AA cliches I had to actually put one to use and it did work for me. I was sober for an hour a minute a second. I had all but opened a beer that's how sure I was that I'd be drunk by the end of the night. "Just stay sober for another 15 minutes". Well after multiple sets of 15 minutes I managed to make it to bed sober. ..The hardest part by far wasn't people drinking around me it was actually when everyone was out smoking or when they all went to bed. "Man I could take a sip right now no one would know." or "Now I can get drunk be alone with my booze just like the old days". ..Rambling now. With that I'll pass...Thanks.

The quiet moments alone were the hardest for me too. I'm glad you got through minute by minute and day by day. You've done it once so it will be easier next time.
You know how to do this and I'm so happy you made the decision to do so.  ..
&gt; "Man I could take a sip right now no one would know." ..Except...you would know.
Good job! I too had some tough moments this holiday but stayed true to what was important to me. I believe that next year will be easier.
The 15 minutes at a time thing is something I will use if need be..I still haven't worked up the nerve to go to bars drinking parties or the casino..I know I must someday.
