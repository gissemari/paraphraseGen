I didn't just quit alcohol I stopped soda about three weeks ago.  Soda was a lifelong habit.  ..I have plenty of problems.  That stress and anxiety led me to drinking both things.  Now that I am out of those habits I see how it was actually contributing to the problems.  I feel like I have reset some of the chemicals in my mind and body.  I feel more balanced and less depressed and anxious.  Yes I still have problems in life.  I still have struggles with self-esteem and value at times.  But those things sure seem to have become more reasonable when they occur.  Sure I haven't had good luck with job prospects lately but I have hope for the future.  I wonder how much these drinks contributed to so many problems for so long.  I can't worry about that though.  ..I'm really ready to get on living the next best part of my life.  ..

I feel you on that! And congrats on 6 weeks that's a really fantastic accomplishment...I've found similar things in changing my daily habits and connecting more with real life. I still have work to go on the candy and sugars honestly so good for you for making that change   but my ways are healthier by far healthy food intake exercise regular communication with other humans it leads to a me stable mind that isn't racing quite so much
Congratulations! In my opinion/experience.... It keeps getting better...Stay strong!
It's amazing how capable we feel when we cleanse our bodies and mind of those poisons! Congratulations to you! IWNDWYT
