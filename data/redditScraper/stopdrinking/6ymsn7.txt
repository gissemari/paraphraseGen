I travel a lot for work. Usually a stop at the lounge means a glass or three of wine. Today I am here and I'm having juice. JUICE! I never drink juice ..Just wanted to tell someone(SD)  because people in my real life are not supportive(I've relapsed too many times for them to trust me yet)..But oh my goodness yay to juice!

Any travelling I did for work included a good half litre or so of wine before I made it onto the plane. Juice is indeed delicious. I tend to ask for a soda water and juice mix to keep it light so I can ease into another one. Good for you friend! I will not drink with you today.
Oh yeah OJ and Clubsoda mix=delicious!
When you're in an airport and you happen to hear a PA announcement that "friends of Bill W." are meeting at this or that location--that's an impromtu meeting of men and women in recovery.  
I love juice!
YAY! Traveling was always hard for me too cuz I lovvvvvveeee(d) drinking in airports. When I had to travel in early sobriety I stayed close to this group and posted about my fears. Everyone was so supportive and awesome. I'm cheering you on!.
