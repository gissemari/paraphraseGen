For the first 110 days or so I knew what day it was. I repeated it over and over every day. I needed that reminder. ..I just noticed that I now know "it's somewhere around X number." I need to check reddit now to know the exact day and that 131 looks and feels great!..If you are struggling right now just keep it moving. Time is slow and painful but its also long and forgiving. It gets better.

It's really funny that you say this right now... This was definitely the week that I lost count. After 100 I've stopped caring to be so precise. It's just like... a lot of days!
I can't wait for the you just described the feeling where you just slide into the daily grind or weekend and the thought does not even cross your mind. I will not drink with myself or you today....Good job!
