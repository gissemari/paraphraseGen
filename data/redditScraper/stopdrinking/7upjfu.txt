Reading some of the science of PAWS our bodies supposedly upregulate acetylcholine when we go sober which increases histamine release. And in my case day 31 of my sobriety seems to be coinciding with some cold hardy flowers starting to bloom on the west coast. I've always had terrible eye allergies but this is just brutal...I will not drink today regardless of the horrendous eye stuff. I just keep thinking about if I can stay sober my allergies should seriously improve because my gut and immune system won't be so trashed (this is the main reason I quit).

Last few days yes! West coast also. Warm and sunny after all that rain. Brutal.
It's not just the immune system. Alcohol causes inflammation which will make your allergies worse. It took a while but my hay fever asthma and even back pain have all improved greatly I suspect simply because these are all in some way inflammatory conditions. Hang in there. PAWS is temporary.
That's so weird my allergies have been terrible worse than ever never considered it could be my sobriety causing it. .IWNDWYT  
Now maybe that explains the itchy skin a few of us have posted about .. mine started pre stopping drinking ... I thought it could be symptom of my body being over wrought at the time as was under stress . ..I hadn't heard of PAWS presumably it's post alc withdrawal syndrome? Don't like idea that I've done that much damage to body I'm essentially detoxing. ..Not going to count days now I'm into month 2 ... but weeks ... still feel strong but worried about a night out tonight ..

I think I have been experiencing some of that. Didn't know what was wrong with me. Thanks!
