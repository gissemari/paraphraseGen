I figure if I'm gonna post here I might as well say a little about myself. It's long and jotted quickly so feel free not to read it...Alcohol really came in and stole my life. I had my first beer at 13. When I was 15 I had my first bottle of wine from my parents wine rack. We didn't just drink the bottle though me and my friend would take one each and chug it. .I can't remember how many times I've puked from this. But we all thought it was funny. ..I had always thought beer was sort of not my thing (until 17) so I would drink liquor. With my thought process being.. why would anyone drink something not to get totally ass drunk? It was very easy to access for me. I would start off taking as many shots as I could about once a week sometimes more... That lead to me going out of my way trying to get more and more. Ultimately it lead to me chugging fifths (sometimes drinking half gallons or more throughout (a lot of times)) almost every single damn day of my life from 18 thru 22 progressively worsening. Those were the ages I started getting drunk multiple times a day once it wore off and my head and stomach hurt I knew of one cure... I've been involved in multiple car crashes involving alcohol three arrests one being a DUI multiple fights with close friends lost girlfriends lost relationships in general lost jobs (I'm holding one now though) needless to say many injuries. That's not what closed the doors of drinking for me though. I thought it was just me in a "funk". ..So I would wake up call my friend we would go get multiple 30 racks MHL and just drink all day and night. Eventually it started to screw with my brain chemicals because I started becoming very angry depressed manic and believe it or not a LIGHTWEIGHT... for two years I was either bed ridden or smashed in a blue moon had a sober two days. This is mainly what worried me. ..I started vomiting daily and nightly. Would drink until one night my friends showed up and I puked blood everywhere. They all told me to stop or they're gone because they don't want to see me kill myself. ..I was walking like an old man for days after benders. Got hospitilized because I got so sick once. COULD NOT get over bar regret until I went back. I would wake up not knowing where I am just trying to find a toilet. So finally I took a break. ..Ever since I've been struggling with sobriety and keep telling myself I'm not an alcoholic I just hit a rough spot when in reality all those wasted days sick days arrests fights crashes all involved alcohol. I would blow VERY high numbers every time I was arrested. Knowing I was well over that at my peak... I would also pop pills when I got drunk. Drunk me was stupid and I'm really not that stupid. Also smoked weed pretty much daily since 16. Which I've been off for 2 months as of now. ..I'm a few years older now (mid 20's) and realize this will kill me young. I thought I was a rockstar because I played in bands. Needless to say those didn't last long with a binging problem like mine. ..Reflecting I hate every second from about the age of 18. Yet I still fail myself sometimes and relapse even after jail and probation (which didn't stop my drinking) because I "know" I won't take it that far. I will and I've proved that to myself multiple times. I have liver problems and a stomach ulcer now. I'm 4th day sober so far after failing a sixty day kick. (Sobriety kick)... I've been to a handful of meetings my license has been suspended again though so it makes it a bit tougher. I can get it back but requires paying fines which I'm not ready for yet...Welp there it is... a little about the problematic portion of my life.
----------immediate responses--------

I used to smoke a lot of weed (talking a quarter a day easily more if I didn't have to work) for about 10 years and the last 6 of those were also where I drank like crazy - 2-3 bottles of wine a night 3/4 of a bottle of gin. After I quit smoking about 2 years ago now (still carried on drinking though) I saw for myself after a few months what it had done to my mental health. All the anxiety mood swings negative self hating thoughts that I thought were just a part of me (ergo the self medicating) - guess what? Not so much. It was all the weed. (and I love the weed let me tell you I now smoke occasionally again though not daily and nowhere near those amounts). And now I have 3 weeks clear of alcohol too I can not express to you how much of all that negative bullshit was the alcohol and the chemicals messing with my brain. Just wanted to share that because that realisation really helped me to let go of the 'aww but i don't get to have any fun anymore' mentality. It's a whole lot easier now. Keep it up it's a long road that we've started on.
