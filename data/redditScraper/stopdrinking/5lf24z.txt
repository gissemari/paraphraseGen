So it started good with a small party with all my friends. Next thing was everyone got more and more drunk after the fireworks and suddenly some dude starts subtle hitting on my heavily drunk gf. Didn't struggle with cravings but I did struggle with the want to punch the guy. So glad it's over. Glad another party with drunk people is over. ..Well made it my second nye without booze so there's that. ..Gfs puking all day so far...Not drinking today!

Great job on staying strong.  Must be strange staring at what you avoided hope your gf feels better soon.  I won't drink with you today!
I'm lucky enough not to have any heavy drinking friends.  Glad you're (we're) not puking today.
