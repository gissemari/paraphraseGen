My name is Jason and I am an Alcoholic...I said some malicious stuff here under the username P0rkJeebus.  I was wrong and being very selfish.  This is not about me.   I was not working my program.  I told someone to enjoy their relapse.  I am not hiding under a new name.  I am beginning again and will never make a negative comment again.  If I do I should be banned.  In the past I was looking for excuses to relapse and I easily found them.  ..I have the utmost respect for the program called AA.  I started researching SMART as well and I have decided AA is still for me.  The only requirement to be a member of AA as well as this subreddit is a desire to stop drinking or as far as this sub goes a desire to moderate or control your drinking.  If you can't moderate or control then maybe it's time to stop altogether...In keeping with the first tradition that states our common welfare should come first; personal recovery depends on AA unity along with the only requirement to be a member of AA (a desire to stop drinking)-  It is my utmost priority to be honest and allow others to be honest.  This is not about me.  ..I am not going to comment or post unless I have something positive to say.  If I do. Just ban me.  Thank you again and I am sorry.

I change my username every year - too much Karma makes me big headed. I'd recommend it to everyone...Welcome back and Good luck.
Impressive. I've been reprimanded here but so far not deleted. I have to keep restraint of pen and tongue more in the forefront of my character defect list. I'm a work in progress too.
