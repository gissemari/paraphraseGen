Background: 31/M/drank a few liters of vodka every week for the past few years went harder after my dad died a couple years ago. Employed no legal troubles involving alcohol looking to start community college....Everyone at the meeting seemed caring and supportive. They seemed to genuinely be struggling with their problem and were quick to welcome someone facing the same struggle....I didn't speak much but I did listen closely to those that did. I recognized many of the feelings and thoughts and scenarios of those that spoke. I came close to tears a couple times because the familiarity hit a little too close to home....However I didn't and don't feel like I belong there. I felt like Thurgood from Half Baked at rehab. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vpin9VhNck...Most of the folks -- bless them they're struggling -- that spoke had had legal problems children taken away or just seemed miserable....I can see myself possibly reaching that 'level' if I don't take control and reign in my drinking but I'm not there. And I don't ever want to be....I enjoy a solid buzz I enjoy relaxing with a couple-few cold beers after work. I don't want to give that up. I just need to learn how to moderate my drinking. ...Is it possible? Is it practical? Can it be done?...I'm in the process of switching from mostly drinking vodka to beer. Takes more to get drunk more expensive and it's harder -- for me anyway -- to get shitfaced on beer. 
----------immediate responses--------

My understanding is that alcoholics who try to moderate always fail. The only solution is to stop drinking...Only you know if you're an alcoholic. The easy way to find out is to see if moderation will work for you...
&gt;&gt; I'm in the process of switching from mostly drinking vodka to beer. Takes more to get drunk.....That kind of thinking is one of the things that separates regular "non alcoholic" drinkers from those of us with a problem.  I drank to get drunk no exceptions.  When we do limit it to "just a few" we just struggle with denying ourselves what our brain really wants...You might be able to change your behaviors to moderating who knows?  Only you can find out.  Even in AA the literature suggests you try it and see for yourself.  Just be honest about what you're feeling and you'll know if it's working or if you just need to quit.  I did and now I no longer torture myself trying to do something my brain isn't wired to do.
This "process" of switching from vodka to beer (why is it a process...?) may be the information you need to decide whether or not you're an alcoholic.  I never had any of the legal trouble or struggles that you seem to think are necessary to seek treatment.  I just recognized that I am an alcoholic because I am compelled to drink in a way that is anything but normal.  There was no getting around it and switching from cheap whisky to expensive whisky back to cheap whisky then to wine then to beer did absolutely nothing to curb my intake of booze in the long run.  There may have been a couple nights where I had some miserable success but it never lasted...**My point is** you should be grateful beyond measure that you have the opportunity to be in those rooms without having experienced dreadful legal consequences.  Keep going back and listening talk to others let them know you're new and trying to figure out if you're an alcoholic.  They won't try to recruit you or trick you into identifying as an alcoholic.  But what you may discover is that you've been having consequences all along and that you weren't as high functioning and you'd like to think you are.  That's what happened for me anyway.  Best of luck.
&gt;Takes more to get drunk more expensive and it's harder -- for me anyway -- to get shitfaced on beer... Where there is a will - there is a way.  ..The trick is to identify with the feelings rather than comparing the situational specifics.  Everyone in that room enjoyed a solid buzz everyone in that room could identify with you on that...&gt;I enjoy a solid buzz I enjoy relaxing with a couple-few cold beers after work. I don't want to give that up. I just need to learn how to moderate my drinking...**note the phrase "couple-few"**.  I am not here to take your inventory or to say you are this or that but "couple-few" tells my story so perfectly...Good luck keep in touch but please remember our experience is that this is a progressive dis-ease and the "YETs" you heard can indeed be yours.

Hahah. I don't mean to laugh it's just that I felt the same way when I first flirted with going to AA 5 years ago. I didn't belong there. I'm 31 now also and guess what moderation didn't work for me. AA isn't about comparing yourself or judging others it's unifying to do one thing and one thing only- stop drinking. You do it to keep yourself sober. You do it to take back control of your life. If you can incorporate the practices and get along without it that's great. Just don't confuse why you are there.
I go into each meeting thinking I'll take what I want and leave what i don't. each meeting is different. 
Only you can decide if you have an issue or not. For me and a lot of the folks here we've tried every trick in the book. Maybe it works for a day or two maybe longer but eventually we go back to getting plowed every night...For me once I have a first drink (4oz Makers) I think - hey I'm really fine not buzzed have another. Once that hits now I figure I might as well get a good buzz going and the quest is on. Every. Damn. Night. I would wake up so pissed that I drank 20oz on a weeknight. I've been playing this game since Septembet of last year and have never felt more like a failure at any other time in my life...Last week I decided to quit the game. I surrender. You win. The damn game is rigged anyway...
The people who are vocal tend to be the ones who are struggling. That was my first my first impression and it certainly turned me off a bit as well. .As far a moderating your drinking aa suggests to people who are not sure if they are an alcoholic to try some moderate drinking. I would at the very least pick up a copy of the big book. Read it while you are having a drink and see if any of it resonates with you...Be careful. I knew a guy who became a moderate drinker. He would only allow 2 beers in his home every night.  What ever was holding that discipline together snapped and he ending up killing someone in his car. His life was over and he was 22- 23 years old.
The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking. There are open meetings too; membership not required...As I drank more some of my "not yets" came true. Live is better when I don't drink and try to grow spiritually. Good luck to you.
The way it was described to me by an old timer when I first went to aa at 23 years old was "you can do almost anything for a month if you try hard enough. How about you try this instead come to these meetings get a sponsor read the big book and apply the 12 steps to your everyday life. If in one years time your life doesn't improve in that time go back to drinking. Whats the worst that can happen? For one year you try to be a good person and besides you tolerance towads alcohol will be really low then." I paraphrased  that of course but that was the gist of what I can remember. But I honestly tried it and haven't looked back yet.
If drinking is costing you more than money then there's a problem...I too haven't yet had to experience many of the consequences that others have. But the consequences I have experienced have been bad enough that I don't want to live like that anymore...I haven't sucked dick for coke and I keep making meetings so that I never have to.
Just from my experience when I was having those conversations with myself I was avoiding the problem. Non-alcoholics don't need to switch the alcohol type to stop themselves. They can just stop themselves and control their actions...I won't call you an alcoholic. Thats not fair I don't know you. I will say that I once had those same thoughts and avoided AA. Eventually my drinking did cause me to destroy my marriage. People don't jump from casual drinker to full blown chaotic drinker overnight. Most of us start off  very casual drinkers. I myself wasn't a problem drinker 3 years ago. I enjoyed drinking occasionally and having fun. At some point that switched...I wish I would have stopped before I hit the turning point. I could have saved myself a lot of heartache and pain by being responsible when my battle was easier. Think about it do you want to wait until you have a terribly sad story to get better? Is that what its going to take? I wish I wouldn't have waited...Once again I'm not saying you are an alcoholic but I am saying I played those same games and I know I'm an alcoholic so be careful...Good Luck!
Here's a fun experiment: either go to a bar or pour yourself a drink at home. Somewhere between your first sip and pouring your second drink try to stop abruptly. Pour it out walk away whatever. Try this experiment a couple of times if you'd like...After doing that I discovered much of what I needed to know about myself. Thankfully I didn't need a cop or judge to point it out.
Give it a go &amp; see what happens.
Its all about choice and control brotha you either got it or you don't. If you can moderate or stop without help more power to you if you can't try out AA. The consequences of drinking has little to nothing to do with drinking its all about how I drink and what happens when I don't.  Good luck to you brotha.
Every time I've ever tried to moderate I still always ended up with a ridiculous amount of empties  in the garage that did not look like moderation in any sense of the word.
Ok here's the thing leagal trouble and drama doesn't make you an alcoholic. An alcoholic is someone that is incapable of moderating or controlling their alcohol consumption. If you are able to control and enjoy your drinking and you enjoy it keep doing it. However if you honestly want to stop and can't then AA can help you. 
Favorite true high bottom story.  NYC cop got off his midnight to 8 am shift knocked back an few beers with the boys in the parking lot and drove home to Staten Island.  Slept got up and drove back to Brooklyn.  Along the way he hit and killed a family of five...When ever people talk about how well they are doing I ask are you doing as well as Heath Ledger or Whitney Houston?  Anna Nicole died a billionaire.
Wouldn't work for me. Once I start i can't stop....months pass. 
Trying different things to moderate/control drinking (and failing) seems to be a nearly universal experience among the AA'ers I hear (myself included). ..There's a great list of "things we tried" in the big book...If it works for you congratulations. If not you know where there are some answers...When I was new in sobriety I also saw AA as a group of messed-up people trying to figure things out. ..Now I see it as a group of people leading sober lives despite a messed-up past...It's both of course.  Remember also that _everyone_ in AA starts as a confused newcomer only a few days away from active problem drinking. They have all been where you are/were. They can all talk to you about it and they will all share their personal experience if asked (pretty awesome actually)...
At the meeting you went to did they by chance get you a copy of the book Alcoholics Anonymous? I think you might find a little in there that hits kind of close to home too. Here are a couple of passages from [chapter 3](http://www.aa.org/bigbookonline/en_bigbook_chapt3.pdf)...&gt;The idea that somehow someday he will control and enjoy his drinking is the great obsession of every abnormal drinker. The persistence of this illusion is astonishing........&gt;Despite all we can say many who are real alcoholics are not going to believe they are in that class. By every form of self-deception and experimentation they will try to prove themselves exceptions to the rule therefore nonalcoholic. .......&gt;Here are some of the methods we have tried: Drinking beer only limiting the number of drinks never drinking alone never drinking in the morning drinking only at home never having it in the house never drinking during business hours drinking only at parties switching from scotch to brandy drinking only natural wines agreeing to resign if ever drunk on the job taking a trip not taking a trip swearing off forever (with and without a solemn oath) taking more physical exercise reading inspirational books going to health farms and sanitariums accepting voluntary commitment to asylums; we could increase the list ad infinitum...Though the book is credited to one guy it's actually the work of a group of people. In 1939 that was the list of some of the plans that they had come up with to not have to completely quit. I think it's actually very apt that you referred to switching drinks as a 'process.'..It's my strong belief that people don't do shit until they have to. With that in mind I encourage you to embrace the beer program and see if it helps. If beer turns out to not be the solution go talk to the guys at AA again. Hopefully you won't have lost anything by that point either.
My advice is to bring this question up to the people in your next meeting and gauge your response by their reaction.
If you don't have a problem with drinking then go back out and drink some more. Try to control it. IF you are an alcoholic we doubt you'll be able to control it. 
&gt; I can see myself possibly reaching that 'level' if I don't take control and reign in my drinking but I'm not there. And I don't ever want to be...You might not be able to see yourself in the situations that you heard about at the meeting but those people probably couldn't either at one point in time. If you don't ever want to be there you should stop drinking now. ..&gt; I enjoy a solid buzz I enjoy relaxing with a couple-few cold beers after work. I don't want to give that up. I just need to learn how to moderate my drinking. ..Drinking more than a few liters a day is not what any normal person would call catching a solid buzz. Do you honestly believe you can moderate your drinking. From everything you've said about how much you drink it doesn't sound like its going to happen for you. ..I can't tell you how many times I've heard someone say there were switching to beer or wine. Or only drinking after 5pm. Or only drinking when out to dinner. Think about what it means that you are switching to beer. People who are able to control their drinking don't have to do this like that right?
&gt; I enjoy a solid buzz I enjoy relaxing with a couple-few cold beers after work. I don't want to give that up. I just need to learn how to moderate my drinking. ..What's missing from your story here are the costs and the risks you are taking.  It's one big enchilada my friend. Trying to negotiate your way out (usually) won't work. How much are you willing to lose because you "enjoy a solid buzz?"..I personally don't believe in a "bottom."  Merely looking ahead to where things are going if you can be honest with yourself can be enough to see that taking action and making a change would likely be in your own best interest. ..Check out [SMART Recovery](http://www.smartrecovery.org).
