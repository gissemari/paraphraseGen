Tonight was the first time I've been to a concert alone and sober (friend bailed last minute) and I was anxious as fuck to go alone. I almost bailed too because the thought of being alone at a concert sober was terrifying. I forced myself to go anyways with a plan to leave if the anxiety got too bad/the urge to drink was there. But when I got there and settled down on my blanket (outdoor venue) and the show started I literally felt high off of everybody else's good energy and happiness and ended up having a blast. ..The lead singer took a moment to ask everyone to give a stranger sitting near them a hug and tell them you hope they have a wonderful summer. I thought that was really cool and it made me feel less alone. We're all strangers but we are all there for the same reason after all.. to rock out to some good music! ..As someone who has terrible social anxiety this was a huge step for me and a confirmation that I CAN have fun alone and without alcohol. Just wanted to share my experience for anyone struggling with anxiety about being sober in a large social setting that it IS possible to enjoy something alone and sober something I NEVER dreamed I could do. it's also nice not to be the girl stumbling around and eventually falling over..something I saw tonight. That girl could have easily been me 112 days ago but not tonight :)
