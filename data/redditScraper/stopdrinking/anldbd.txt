This is the first time I've ever posted to reddit so I can't believe I'm about to confess my sins to the internet... but I really fucked up and I don't know who to turn to... I've been trying to quit drinking on and off since December because I realized after getting a DUI in September that I might really have a problem. So I have been in court ordered treatment which requires me to be sober but since I lied my way through the evaluation they put me I  the lowest level treatment and dont really test us so I've been getting away with drinking still... the longest I've managed to stay sober is one week...I came home wasted yesterday to my boyfriend who is also an addict and has been sober for over 5 months now. I was so ashamed of myself I tried to avoid him. I must have blacked out because apparently I locked myself in the bedroom and passed out. He thought something was wrong so he went through my phone and found some pretty incriminating stuff from a couple months ago.. (he spent some time in jail for violating probation) some shit drunk and lonely me said I had no business saying while in a relationship. He is furious with me and I'm so afraid of losing him...Drinking has affected my job (doesnt help that I'm a bartender) it has distanced me from my family I'm in debt way over my head and have fines from my DUI on top of everything else. And now I'm terrified I'm going to lose my best friend my love my whole heart. ..I'm still struggling to accept that I have a problem and I need to stop. I feel like I've hit rock bottom and I hurt the only person who knows what I'm going through and cares about my sobriety. I don't know how to get back up again.

First a "blackout" is when the brain does not retain short term memory. When you "pass out" your brain does not keep any of the most recent memories. That's why you can't remember what you did. It is NOT a loss of control. It is NOT an excuse for out of character behavior. It is NOT an excuse. ..Second you can do this. You CAN do it. ..Good luck. 
I think you know you have a problem. You know I used to envision that alcohol was a bottle of anti-freeze standing there on the counter. Poison right? Only a suicidal person would drink that right? Well that is what alcohol is poison actually. If it can rob you of your consciousness mess up your relationships and make you lie you sure don't need it. Good luck and take advantage of that rehab program! Get honest with them and yourself and you will be surprised how good you feel.
