The real reason I started drinking again is because I'm an alcoholic and I let alcohol and thoughts of alcohol poison my mind/body...Maybe I felt that with my DUI stuff winding down it was OK or because I had gotten to a different place mentally over the past year or so I thought it wouldn't be a problem. I even heard myself saying to a friend "I think I can handle it now that I won't take it too far" &lt;-- what a load of shit. ..Last Friday was my last drink...I got super wasted with my husband and we stayed the night at a friend's house. We stayed safe but I still felt so wrong in the morning...hungover not at my own house not remembering all parts of the evening then dragging ass the whole day when our friends were visiting and I should've been at full capacity. When it comes to beer I just can't stop. ..Then this past week I've felt like I'm back where I was when I first quit drinking. Where is my positive mood and energy? Where is my natural happiness? Why am I being snippy to my husband? What happened to my coping methods?! ..And of course if I'm being honest with myself I came to the conclusion that drinking (regardless of how frequent or infrequent) makes me into a person I don't like. The way I "train my brain" during my drinking periods are all lies and excuses I tell myself. It certainly doesn't make me into a better person - which is what I truly want to be...Went to my first AA meetings in 2 months today over lunch time. I thought about going to a meeting that I haven't been to before. Ended up going to my home group. I didn't admit that I've been drinking but our discussion was spot on with what I'm struggling with. It was great to be around others who know what I go through and can relate to the same struggles - regardless of the details. It was good to fall back on my foundation...I don't even feel the guilt of throwing 6 months of sobriety away anymore. I just want to get back on track back to that sober person I like so much better. ..New sober date: 3/10/18 - I will not drink with you today...Each day is a new beginning - one day at a time &lt;3
