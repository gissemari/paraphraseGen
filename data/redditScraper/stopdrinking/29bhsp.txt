Each time I'm in the last few days before I hit another month I use that as a motivator when I am struggling to not pick up a drink. Even if I'm not struggling I'm very aware of how long it'll be until I have another month under my belt...This time however I didn't even realize I had hit another month! I guess I have been pretty busy with work and stuff but I take it as progress. I couldn't imagine a month "flying by" back when I was a month or two sober...Thank you all for your posts here they help me every day.

Hi _LB_- Always a treat to hear from you especially news like this. Yahoo! 
That's awesome _LB_!  Oh now I see why SOmuch2learn italicized your name -- it's the underscores.
Good work LB!
The number 7 (  Pinyin: q ) symbolizes "togetherness". It is a lucky number for relationships. It is also recognized as the luckiest number in the West and is one of the rare numbers that is great in both Chinese and many Western cultures. It is a lucky number in Chinese culture because it sounds alike to the Chinese word   (Pinyin: q ) meaning arise and also   (Pinyin: q ) meaning life essence...7 sounds like a good month to me! Pretty cool you didn't have to hold onto that mental talisman this last month. Progress.  YES!  Congrats LB. :-)
