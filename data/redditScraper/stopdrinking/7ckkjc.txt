9/5/15 was the day of my last drink. it was also the last time i was arrested. i struggled with sobriety for a long while after that night and probably more so with the fact that i was not able to live life on my terms. i quit the cozy managerial desk job i had worked so hard at for the previous 5 years and checked myself into outpatient treatment at a health realization clinic. after i had completed their program i set out on my new journey with the same mindset as the night that i was arrested. life wasn't fair. i'd been dealt a bad hand. poor me. all the while my wife is standing beside me as if nothing has ever changed. because it hadn't. i was a dry drunk mad at the world unable to accept that i was the reason for my own shitty attitude. she was still stuck defending herself and her actions to me and defending me to others. i lived this life for almost a year and a half and then something clicked. i had a  spiritual awakening' as they call it in AA. a few months ago i went through every aspect of my life and cleaned up any and all things toxic. i've changed my attitude towards the people i interact with i've finally realized that life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it. i've quit smoking cigarettes and cut back on the junk food. i took a chance and applied for an assistant manager position at a local restaurant and just had my second interview today for general manager. i've also realized that while i have changed my wife refuses to and probably never will. she'll always be the person i met and married as a drunk and to her i will always be a dry drunk. we have completely different views on life and after having been sober the past two years i am deciding to call it quits. i may not have a choice but to live life on life's terms but that doesn't mean that i'm not responsible for the direction that my life takes or that i don't deserve to be happy. .thank you for listening it feels good to get that off of my chest.

Congrats on two years and sorry about the dissolution of your marriage. 
"Never" is a dangerous word for me.  If I can change anybody can.  Expectations of other people are resentments in the making.  My first marriage didn't survive my recovery either but I had a major part in that failure.  Divorce is horrible and I don't recommend it unless it is absolutely necessary.
