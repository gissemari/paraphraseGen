Just like i said in the title. Relapsed after about 3 weeks than drank a lot. I mean like maybe worse than ever before. I  stopped yesterday morning and haven't slept all night. Got 3 hours of sleep today and woke up i a huge pool of sweat like all my clothes were wet and my bed. It's just a terrible feeling having to go through this again...

I am so sorry. Please know that many of us have been there and your feelings do matter...Ride the wave of uncomfortable feelings... they will dissipate..I will not drink with you today!!
Been there myself and I am sure most people here have too.  I won't be drinking with you today.   Great that you got some sleep and so good you are here!  We are in this together and I am sure  you will start feeling better soon...you've been there before it just takes a couple more days- and  then I am sure your resolve to stay sober is even stronger now!
I relapsed last thanksgiving after 3 months sober and let it turn in to a 4 month bender. Like you I was drinking harder than ever. I know that pain. Welcome back let's try again!
I won't drink with you today. X
Damn this is my exact same story. I got to 17 days and went to a party with some friends and crashed hard. Drank myself silly for a week straight now dealing with the withdrawals after I decided to stop again. Couldn't sleep all night just sitting there questioning why I do this to myself! Hope you feel better soon and best of luck.
What got me sober was persistence. Never give up!
Man I relapsed so many times before going into detox. I am still a bit worried about relapsing again. Just remember relapse does not mean you are weak or a horrible person. Just try again today.
