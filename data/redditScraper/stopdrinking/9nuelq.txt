Four months sober after countless relapses around the one month mark. Don't ever give up on your sobriety. It's the greatest gift you can give yourself.

Your words will inspire those who get stalled out by relapsing at a certain point.  They'll see that's it's possible to get beyond that as you have if they just keep trying.
