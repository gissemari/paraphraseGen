I went to the store to pick up beer for my father and future brother-in-law this evening...Pangs of jealousy ripped through me as I watched people toting their six packs and bombers handles of liquor and bottles of wine. I could almost feel that glow of connectedness comfort and joy that a steady supply of wine and beer would ensure I enjoyed with friends and family...We all deserve those feelings and we feel that much worse when we don't have them during periods that society tells us they should be the strongest. I've lived through a sober hell for more than two months now without joy or even a glimpse of peace...Why shouldn't I grab a bottle of bubbles a twelve pack of something wintery and some nice reds?..Because I don't want my happiness to be dictated by the whims of a drug that will eventually only cause me pain and misery. Fuck living on those terms any longer. For every night of chemically induced warmth and joy I ensure future hardship malaise and emptiness. ..My dad will have a beer or two tomorrow. Maybe a glass of wine. Some friends will have a few glasses of wine some will drink diet coke. They won't think twice about what they are or aren't drinking and I will envy that. And then I'll let it go...I won't have a bottle of champagne while I'm cooking another bottle during the meal and beers until I'm asleep...I don't know how to be alright without drinking yet and while that's frustrating and enraging it's completely logical. 10+ years of conditioning my body and mind to find fun excitement and solace in a bottle of booze or pills isn't undone in a couple of months...I'll find all of those things and I'll find them without alcohol. I owe that to myself my friends my family and to everyone else struggling. Much love and peace.......

You will indeed locate *all* those things!  ..New patterns habits and the welcoming *sober* triggers were exciting discoveries for me!  ..I purchased wine for guests for tomorrow but have no interest myself. When I first struggled to quit I Never thought that would happen!
You're doing great.  We'll get there.  I am making the most delicious non-alcoholic sparkling punch and fresh hot apple cider with mulling spices to enjoy during festivities.  I hope you have some extra fancy beverage to celebrate with.  It helps me feel like I'm not missing out on anything when I have something even more delicious to sip on.  ..Wishing you strength and success!
