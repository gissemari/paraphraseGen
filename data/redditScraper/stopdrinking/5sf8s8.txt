I'd like to first thank everyone for their support and to have a place that I can admit I have a problem. I'd also like to apologize as I feel that these first few days will make me post more frequently than I normally would sorry. I'm putting my faith in the people here to help me through this. I have a support system. I admitted to my brother and to my fiancee that I have a problem. While my fiancee knew my brother did not and was completely shocked. I guess I was better at hiding it from my family than I thought. My brother is 100% on board though and is taking it seriously. He is also a no holds bar brutal honest type - always has. I just feel that posting here will help me as much if not more...Today is my first day choosing on my own not because I'm too hungover not to drink. It'll be exceptionally difficult because my wedding is around the corner (Feb 17th). I feel that I can make it to the wedding but the actual wedding is what I fear the most. ..So I ask now to prepare myself for what may possibly be the biggest test of this journey how do you cope with not drinking when everyone around you is? Right now my brother and fiancee are the only two that know. I plan to sip on tonic/lime at the wedding to avoid questions and offers for a drink. I have faith that my fiancee and brother will keep me from drinking but I want to enjoy the wedding and not remember it as a struggle not to drink. I also want to remember my wedding and that alone will keep my from having a drink - at least I think.

The only person that keeps me from drinking is me. Relying on others to keep me sober gives them way too much power and control that they don't even have
Congrats.  Sounds like you have a lot of good stuff coming up in your life.  As far as the wedding goes.  It's yours not theirs. And bonus you will actually get to remember it all.
