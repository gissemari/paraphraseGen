Hey everyone. I'm 24 years old and was heavily drinking every day for over 3 years (and binge drinking on weekends for years before that). Today is my 25th day without drinking and I feel as though my psychological symptoms of withdrawal are peaking. I thought the initial withdrawal was going to be the worst part - the shakes vomiting paranoia and mood swings. Now I'm experiencing severe anxiety depression and a feeling of general hopelessness regarding my alcohol use. Can anyone speak to their experience with withdrawal symptoms this far out from quitting alcohol use? Any thoughts are appreciated. ..I won't succumb to alcohol but I hope it gets easier.

The first month is rough. Around day 50 I started having good days. Around day 100 is when most people report major relief. In the first 30 days I could barely leave my house without having a panic attack don't worry it will pass just give it some time and take baby steps...You might want to look up something called "Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome" or PAWS which will talk a lot about these non-physical symptoms. Some general keys are to eat well exercise and sleep as much as possible.
Hang in there my friend. It gets much easier as you detox. My brain was pretty pickled after 16 years of hard drinking. The first month was pretty rough and I was pretty emotionally unstable for the first 6 months. I went to AA meetings and met up with an addictions counselor. Find something inspirational to read. I've heard that Russel Brands's book "Recovery" is pretty good. .Breathe eat healthy foods lots of water. 28 years sober now. If I can do this you can. How is your support system?
