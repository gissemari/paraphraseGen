I'm bummed but still rocking my meetings. Staying accountable forgiving myself picking back up with more self awareness I still have the tools I've been working on and I will not allow any false confidence to creep in. I can't have just one. Just one turns into three days straight. I knew better. I learned the hard way. I'm back up to two sober days and by the grace of whatever I'm not suffering so bad this time around. I'll feel better when I get back into the double digits for sure...In other news the boyfriend finally got picked up for DUI and a warrant from a couple counties over for an excessive DUI he skipped out on. It's a damn shame tbh because they were previously willing to drop the excessive bit if he was in compliance. Now he's looking at a potential felony DUI charge and depending on how pissed the counties are he's looking at anywhere between 30 days and 5 years...The silver lining of course is that he's being forced to dry out longer than he's been able to in years. He's safe he's sober. Prior to incarceration he was continuously trying to white knuckle so I have hope that his head and heart are at least finally caught up to realizing his problem. I refuse to have high hopes because I'd rather not be brutally disappointed but I am waiting to see how sentencing plays out...Him being locked up has been one more external motivator for maintaining my own sobriety. I'm taking any and every reason I find to heart so I can keep stringing together the days...IWNDWYT.

Glad you're back.  You can only be responsible for your own actions.  Hope he figures it out on his own.  IWNDWYT
