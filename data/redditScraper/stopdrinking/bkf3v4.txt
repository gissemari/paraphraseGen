Go grab a Starbucks or a La Croix curl up in a blanket and watch A Call to Courage on Netflix. Especially if you're struggling right now! If you've decided you're going to drink tonight just watch this first before you head out.

Thank you for this.
What is it about?
Good idea. I'm headed to a speaker meeting. I will watch after. Thanks!
Tried looking for this and it's not coming up on Netflix..... wait found it. Under Brene Brown: A call to courage. Watching now. Already drank tonight but watching anyways. Always a tomorrow.
