Can't decide whether to drink or not tonight stressing out over it. I could go either way at the moment...EDIT:Thanks guys craving it like mad but I'm going to take your advice and resist just for tonight I'll reassess tommorow.

Tomorrow will you regret not drinking if you choose to hold off?  I've personally never ever ever regretted the decision to not drink. 
Why not commit to not drinking tonight and giving it more thought in the morning?
The in-between feeling isn't good. You can decide not to drink and to do something celebratory instead. Maybe have some ice cream?
Maybe try saying "not tonight." I do that sometimes and tell myself I can always revisit the idea tomorrow. The next day I always feel so happy that I didn't drink and committing to the next day isn't as hard.

Why are you even allowing your brain to debate this?   I make a decision every day that no matter what happens I will not drink. There is no choice to make after that.
I haven't yet wished I'd drank the day before so I won't drink today.
Go to bed early! You won't regret it in the morning. At the end of the day my willpower is shot...Also notice that alcohol is a source of stress for you. It is the CAUSE of the stress you're feeling.
Your 2 days in. Soon U start feeling better at an accelerating pace. Yeah just don't drink tonight. I won't either.
Keep as busy as you possibly can. You have 2 days 48 hours that you earned! You can visit the IRC and hang out with us to chat watch a movie go to sleep early whatever it takes. You can do this! :)
Let's eat some really good food instead.  
Why is day 2 always so hard? I remember my day 2 being hard and I posted here too.  It really helped.  Hang in there - I will not drink with you tonight.
