March 04 of this year would have marked 3 years in sobriety for me. I relapsed a few weeks before and have been on and off ever since..I've finally managed to get double digits in days after realising how my relapse had affected my family and had caused trouble for me in school..This sub has been amazing for me and I'm so excited to not drink with you all today..Going to stay with family tomorrow for a few nights where I know I'll be safe and then back to school next week. I need to start going back to more AA meetings as that is why I was able to get close to 3 years before..Thank you everyone here.IWNDWYT

Welcome back!!! :) Something that really helped me was listening to AA speaker tapes on youtube. They are fantastic I really recommend it. Find speaker you resonate with and go from there. That's great that you've made it for 3 years in the past so you know it's posible. Best of luck. IWNDWYT
