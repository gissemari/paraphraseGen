It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-----------------------------------------.**[Warning: Nasty medical issues are discussed.]**..**Struggle:** I've had some questionable (meaning: bad) lab results after a recent medical test and now I have to go back to a clinic in California for a more invasive and painful procedure so that they can figure out what's going on with my insides. They can't schedule it for when I return home in about a week to get a sonogram of my cirrhotic liver and also a crown for one of my teeth so I will have to get the procedure done when I fly home again in mid-May to get an infusion of drugs for my multiple sclerosis and also an MRI on my brain to see if my tumor which was treated with radiation about a year ago has stated growing again or not. Gah! So I'll be facing a series of scary and painful medical procedures over the next few weeks. ..**Triumph:** These days I am able to face unpleasant problems head-on and try to solve them unlike during a time not all that long ago when I was drinking heavily keeping myself deeply in denial and hiding myself from everyone and everything...Someone very wise on this sub once said  When the situation goes sour and it's time to deal with some serious shit I want sure footing a steady hand and clear sight.  And that's exactly how I feel about staying sober so that I can handle these difficult but important medical issues. With the calm focus of sobriety I can *deal.*. .**General:** Seen on a sign recently:  I want to be the kind of woman that when my feet hit the floor in the morning the Devil says  Oh crap. She's up.'

Sending all the good juju I can spare your way. IWNDWYT
**Struggle** Every day seems to be a battle between me and food since I quit. I really want to get down to 120 or heck even 130. But every time I hit 163ish its like the cravings get so out of hand that I just cave. Its like my body or my mind or something is afraid that if I lose ALL my vices Ill be someone else. Someone Im not proud of or something. But me right now is like that's ridiculous. And yet its only gotten worse the longer I stay sober. Like a bizzare panic switch or something. And not tracking my weight makes it even worse because if I dont track I somehow always go back up to 170 right back where I started the month! Its really unmotivating and starting to make me feel like drinking just one night would help me not to panic. Which I ALSO know is ridiculous. But the thoughr always lingers when I get stressed because being stressed and sober was never my forte....**Triumph** I haven't called out of work this month because Im too hung over or because I want to spend it drinking/smoking pot instead. Hopefully this continues and I can not only focus and study properly for finals that are upcoming but also I can finally save up sick days since I usually call in once a month to spend a day being not sober and chilling (and therefore am always out of sick time)....**General Musing** If I didnt have the support of this community Id have failed long ago. I know you guys are just internet strangers who are only similar to me in the struggle to be sober but thats enough you know? When I tried to quit and be sober alone Id always cave within 3 days. But here I feel accountable. I dont want to have my badge reset. I dont want to tell you guys I caved. Id feel sad that I lost my twins and my almost twins. I never realized how hard it is to live life sober when all your friends smoke pot or drink. And even though I want to one day return to pot (when I have lived sober a few months and feel I can use it responsibly without being dependent on it) after joining this group and staying completely sober for as long as I have I think Im finally ok with the idea of never smoking again if it turns out I CANT be responsible with it. Sober living used to be scary. But now I know that its fantastic and only a little scary.
Struggle: Last Saturday I relived an experience where emotional shock made me clutch my chest and retire to bed for about 10 hours. My heart felt black hot and my left side felt tightly wound. If I was a guessing man I'd say I had a very mild heart attack. Without going into too many details let me say I literally prayed my way through that black night. ..Triumph: Yesterday and today I made a decision to step back and let life take its course. I left the situation in God's hands. (Sorry - for a lot of people who are not into the God concept my God is all I have during my dark times. At the risk of upsetting y'all I choose to credit him for me being where I am today) .I spent an hour cleaning my apartment watered my plants and had a decent meal. I realized that I did not drink despite such an intense shock. I'm grateful I am alive that I possess some semblance of control over my life and that I matter. My love is important enough to where I can shower it on myself and not feel guilty...General: spottedfish wrote me a nice comment and this 40yo man broke down crying. Funny how empathy can be felt across the interwebs. I appreciate every single one of you at SD. Your struggles your stories - of success of failure and of getting up again all matter. They are the grit and gristle that make humanity so powerful. You beautiful souls keep on going. Hope your todays are better than your yesterdays and your tomorrows are better than your todays. IWNDWYT   
Beaming some high frequency love your way too Mary.  *LOVE* your general!!
Hey friends. I've been off the wagon for about two months. I sobered up a bit after my daily drinking and I don't want to do this again tomorrow. I have to go to a meeting tomorrow and I know I can  and most likely will change my mind in the hours when I have to go to work and get through the day. I'm going to sleep now but I want this to be the last thing I think about tonight and the only thing I think about tomorrow I have to start over.
Sending lots and lots of love and support for what's ahead Mary...**Struggle**: Trying to be grounded amidst several minor and major difficult events:..\- A senior street dog with a hematoma we had removed then developed a post-surgical infection. She's being well taken care of but she's in so much distress emotionally. And her pack member another dog who hangs out here is so dull without her. ..\- There's no internet at home so I'm on data. My phone battery is 46 degrees celsius hot because of how hard the data hotspot is making it work. ..\- There's a jackhammer being worked very hard in the next house since the last...two hours. I hope it stops soon. I need my morning to work. ..\- My dad is hovering around the house it's a holiday today and I have a feeling I'm going to get distracted/lose my focus. He's going to ask me to play scrabble with him but I just don't have the time or energy to deal with him. ..\- Going through a mild binge/addiction to these almond croissants. Ordered *two* yesterday. I've eaten one every day for the last few days. Oof. ..(And so on)...**Triumph**: No idea. Another day of sobriety for sure. Slowly starting to address my related financial issues. Starting to allow money to just lie there without acting on the compulsion to *spend* it to *wreck* it. ..**General:**  Still in a dire situation with housing. No idea where to go.
**Struggle:** Relapsed Friday night after two weeks without and the night wasn't even fun. I had almost an entire bottle of wine the better part of 375 ml of gin and some beer...Now I feel like shit. Mind's shot skin's dry been skipping out on the gym (went once since then though felt good) stomach's been hurting since then (acid reflux) and I can't concentrate on shit. I was also dehydrated for a couple days cause I neglected drinking water during a good part of that binge and I'm addicted to caffeine. Even after drinking a shitton of water it just went right through me cause of the caffeine. At least coffee's good for the liver...And before that life stress got to me and I got back into my compulsive drinking...**Triumph:** I only drank 6 times this year (all from mid-February to mid-April) and that was after 5.5 straight months without it. That's 3x a month on average post-breaking my streak...I've also been getting to know my motivations for drinking a bit better. I've not just used it for dealing with emotions or for escape I've used it as a means to the end of connecting with other people. Getting drunk has never been the end in itself. It's always been about escape or connection...**General:** My diet is the best it's ever been and my skin was amazing during the 5 months I went without alcohol. Can't wait until it goes back to being that way...I'm taking a break from drinking. I'll go at least until the end of August for sure. I'm telling myself "I'm never gonna drink again!" but I know it's perfectly possible that somewhere down the line I'll give into the temptation one night and have a decent night with it drink some more have a shitty night and killer hangover with it then give it up again...If I had quality friends I see regularly and a girlfriend in my life I wouldn't need or want alcohol. I'm really lonely these days. The first time I drank was at a party with people whose company I genuinely enjoyed but I didn't befriend any of them more than following each other on social media. Second time was on a date where I wanted to loosen up a bit then I got the urge to go blackout as usual but held off on it. The girl wasn't feeling me. I was at home after the date in self-defeating anxiety cause I didn't smash and the alcohol was fucking with me...And after that I went back to my old drinking habits. Going out on weekends then coming home and blacking out with a Youtube binge while drunk texting people. It's pathetic looking at it when I'm not under the influence. I'm not talking to anyone in person besides strangers I chat up in bars (though I go out with a friend once in a long while) then I go home alone and watch random shit I don't even remember watching until I get tired enough to go to bed and pass out. ..Then my mind is shot for 4-5 days I can't be arsed to do anything productive on the weekend even if I want to and I'd basically spent money on a short dopamine rush a bit of superficial interaction and some entertainment I have no memory of followed by cognitive and physical impairment for the better part of the next week...Welp at least this weekend won't be like that. I'll be productive healthy and sane.
Struggle: I'm still dealing with the consequences of my last drunk night out. ..Triumph: Day 3 sober day 76 without cigarettes. ..Regular: Tomorrow and Friday are national holidays where I leave and I'll be spending them by the sea. I'll try to fit a run in there too!
Keep us posted on your results Mary. We're with you...**Struggle** Work as always. I'm still never caught up there no matter how I try. ..**Triumph** Got my electric scooter out yesterday for spring and rode it to work and gym after work etc. I about froze my ass off on it in the morning but I was determined to have it be spring here! ..**General** I love your comment about the Devil Mary. I'm going with that today too. That's right Devil. I'm up!
**Struggle:** Last year I lost 1/3 of my income. A month ago I was given a compensation that would almost cover my loss. Now it turns out I won't get it anyway. It feels like an existential rejection. I'm really frustrated. Turns out that disappointment is a huge trigger for me...**Triumph:** I did an awesome job cutting down trees yesterday preparing firewood for the winter. Still got all my fingers and toes...**General:** Or struggle #2: I'm taking the family to see my parents the upcoming weekend. I don't like it there. I want to see my father except from that I don't want to go. I do it only to create memories for the kids and for my mother to not feel bad. I have so much respect for those of you who take care of your difficult parents. I love mine too but I really hate it there.
Struggle: I haven't really had an strong desire to drink since I stopped. Typically when I make a decision like actually decide to do something I just outright change my mind and do it. However I've been having some issues at work for the first time in 3 months and I can easily see that having a few beers before would have been the way I dealt with that stress in the moment and/or that night. It's made me realize I need to find a way to deal with this stress because I feel like I'm taking it out on my girl friend and driving myself a little crazy. How do you guys burn stress? I could maybe try to do meditation again...Triumph: I've been going to bed at 10-1030 for a couple months now and waking up at 6:30 with my puppy to take her out. The last few days I've gotten in bed between 9:30-10 and I think it's great. I'd be doing something stupid in this time and I'd rather do those things in the morning when I'm fresh and ready to go for the day. Also if I can go to bed early and get outside in the beautiful morning weather and play tennis then life is better...General: I told a buddy of 15 years yesterday that I stopped drinking 3 months ago he was a big frat guy back in the day and lives in a trendy city so I'm sure he drinks a lot of beer still. I thought he would be pretty supportive of it since he's really into biking and he lost a lot of weight over the last year or so but he just said "I mean...." and "It's good you realized that about yourself. Good for you."  I guess in retrospect that's not that bad but he stopped responding after that lol. Probably weird news for someone to hear or process from someone they only talk to every 3 months or so.

You're in my thoughts Mary.  IWNDWYT
**Struggle**: Starting to see my relationships as they are without the veil of alcohol. One in particular is difficult to face and I'm not sure where it's going. My marriage too--which I've known for a long time isn't good--seemed easier to deal with then I was drinking. ..**Triumph**: Despite above I'm 19 days sober and feel stronger and more capable of handling issues in my life. I haven't had a stretch this long in 16 years. I look better and generally feel better. I looked in the mirror this morning and couldn't believe how clear my eyes looked instead of yellowy and bloodshot. My mindset is slowing shifting from "OK I'm just taking a break from alcohol" to "Maybe I'd rather just live like this forever instead."..**General**: I'm so grateful I found this SD community. It's a wonderful respite that's been so helpful to me. Thanks everyone.
On day three.. Sleeping last night was a little tough. Waking up this morning felt like a truck hit me. But some of that's passed and am plowing through.
Oh Mary that sounds like a lot and scary stuff.  Sending you all of the good vibes and best wishes.  I really appreciate your honesty in sharing with us what you're going through and how maintaining sobriety gives you the strength and clarity to deal with it.  Adding a little Colorado strength to boost you up!..**Struggle:**  Seeing a new therapist to help me process my relationship and why I'm so stuck in making changes I want in my life.  She thinks that while I'm really good at learning about myself and analyzing my feelings I've disconnected from actually *feeling* my feelings that I'm all up in my head.  I thought I was done processing my tumultuous childhood and inappropriate father but it sounds like we're delving back in there.  Dammit.  I'm so stuck I'll take any road right now.  Just wish I knew how to do this.  I feel totally blind...**Triumph:**  I'm seeing a therapist!  And she's near me.  And my insurance covers it!  These are good things and I'm giving myself this gift...**General:**  It's been so long since I've felt a zest for life outside of physical activity or time in nature.  I'm really hoping this therapist helps me uncover that fun-loving girl again.
**S:**  Depression.  I'm not one of those people where their depression went away when they got sober.  My depression got worse.  An alcohol centered life offered a great distraction from depression.  The cycle of high highs and low lows offered some form of stability for me.  Furthermore it allowed a scapegoat in my life.  It was if I only can quit drinking it will solve all of my problems.  Being sober for over three years I realize how naive this belief was.  ..Depression for me manifests as irritability lack of patience and chronic pain.  In addition I feel very overwhelmed by everything.  For instance this morning when I went to make coffee I realized that I didn't have enough to make my 4 cups to get me going. ..A normal person would I assume just be like oh I'm out of coffee.  For me it's like I'm such a horrible person.  I failed.  I can't even be responsible enough to make sure I have enough coffee.  If I can't even handle making coffee for myself what makes me think I can handle any of the other stuff that I'm dealing with??..I was doing alright then I had a bad day at work and it turned into a cascade of horrible things.  I then had my contract canceled at work.  Then that leads to a whole host of issues.  Money yeah it's not everything but it's kinda important.  I'm back to the drawing board which is not a good place.  ..**T:**  Hard to see right now.  But I've developed a good foundation that will help me to stay on track.  I can get through today.  I know that for sure.  Then tomorrow I'll deal with tomorrow....**G:**  "Today is a day the Lord has made let us rejoice and be thankful in it."  -- The Bible (Psalms I think maybe I dunno not going to look it up)
Sending serenity Mary.
Struggle: Have posted about this a lot but I really don't like my job. They dump as much stuff as they can on us (people in my same position) and just tell us to do our best. So many things fall through the cracks that I feel like I am doing a terrible job but I haven't even gotten that much negative feedback. I have a performance review coming up and part of me expects they will put me on a performance improvement plan but then again I thought that last time and I was told I was doing a good job. It's maddening. I feel like I am going crazy. I used to think that it wasn't so bad that even though I felt like I was drowning in all this work they want us to do at least I wasn't getting written up for not completing it or fired. But now I have realized that I want to feel like I am good at what I do. That just surviving is not worth it...Triumph: So I did something about it. I applied at a few different places. And I already might have an interview lined up at one of them. It feels good to finally decide that this job is not worth it. ..General: Going on our road trip in just 3 days! We leave Saturday morning. I am so excited!
Sending healing thoughts your way. Sounds like you've got a great life philosophy one I will definitely learn from. Happy Hump Day and I will not drink with you today.
I have tried to reduce my drinking time and again. After a bender this weekend where I made terrible decisions (as always) I'm back on the wagon. However I like to have fun - I have lots of friends who all drink and I don't want to sit out because I'm trying to abstain. Next week I had planned a silly trip to a strip club for lunch and boozing. My coworker and new friend is very excited and even said "We're gonna get wasted and stay there all day FYI." ..I want to go but I don't want to drink or at least a lot which is what I feel like is going to happen. She's also a new friend and I don't necessarily want to go on about my struggles (not to mention all my other friends will be into getting wasted but would understand if I told them my situation). Any tips?
Struggle: I had a moment of clarity that inspired me to try again for sobriety. A very good friend of mine no longer wants anything to do with me (right now anyway). I truly thought I wasn't doing anything wrong because I was only hurting myself. Seems like the truth is I was wrong; I'm just the only thing I was thinking of...Triumph: Since yesterday I have.-Gone back to AA.-Scheduled a meeting with a potential sponsor.-Scheduled a meeting with a psychiatrist..General: I spent most of yesterday binging Flavor of Love. It's a guilty pleasure but it's something I watched as a teenager (before I started drinking) and it's kind of like comfort food?
**Struggle:** Today I'm feeling super overwhelmed with everything. Moving keeping up with recovery (which in itself is a job) other miscellaneous duties and errands. It's been a rough week my place is a disaster and I feel like I'm not making any progress. Easter is this weekend so I have to go out of town which is stressful as well...**Triumph:** After today I will have been sober for the longest amount of time since attempting to quit...**General:** I'm feeling pretty low. Anxious unmotivated. It's quite a terrible combination.
Hello sfgirlmary and SD. ..Your Devil quote made me think of an Irish (I think?) song The Devil and The Widow. That old Devil sure feared that Widow and the song is bawdy and hilarious. I have a smile on my face just thinking about it :)  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3JNqADWmY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3JNqADWmY) ..&amp;#x200B;..Struggle: I have a lot of family arriving in town for a family celebration this weekend. I love hanging out with them but alcohol will be ever present. And my dad is bottling some of his new delicious beer! I will be bringing my own fancy drinks to avoid distraction but this will likely be a challenge. Family time begins tonight. I am determined to remain strong and sober. Maybe it won't be as much a struggle as it seems right now...Triumph: I am still sober. 10 days in so double digits (woo!). I'm making good progress on my bedroom project and my skin is starting to look amazing!  Still free from smokes too and feeling pretty good...General: I've decided I'm going to join a gym again and my son will be joining me. It will be tough to get up so early but I think it will be a good thing. I will take it slow but I will take it steady.
I nearly dropped the ball today. I saw a friend's car at the pub and slowed down to turn in... One wouldn't hurt right? Except that it would. I have gotten to know myself well since starting this journey. I sped up gave the pub the finger and got home unscathed. I'm proud of myself tonight... IWNDWYT!
Struggle: It's been my first week sober in years and still very much getting used to filling my time with other things. My boyfriend runs a pub so it's been an adjustment to not just head straight there after work (or to not ask for more than a tea if I do want to hang out)...Triumph: Managed an evening out at a gig yesterday and surprised myself with how comfortable I felt staying sober and still having as much fun. Felt even better when I woke up this morning and realised I could remember the show I paid to see and my day off wasn't about to be wasted on a hangover.  
Today is one of those  theater of the absurd  kind of days where things aren't particularly being put on my shoulders but everyone around me is acting like an idiot and that's making my life more stressful than it could be if they weren't. ..This is one of my triggers to drink because it used to help me laugh at the ridiculousness of it all and shrug it off until alcohol became problematic for me.  I had to stop and remind myself of that just a few minutes ago...I guess a triumph is that I'm able to remember that instead of getting a six pack and then another one tomorrow and so on.
Struggle: Oh man work work work. I've got two week deadline to finish building a website and obviously everyone has decided to throw me a ton of last minute changes right before it needs to be up. ..My stress levels are through the roof right now I can't wait for this to be over...Triumph:  Despite really worn out and not up for it - I still went and did some projection training for the community run volunteer cinema nearby. I might actually get to screen some films for people which would be super cool...General: I completed Horizon Zero Dawn - one thing I sucked at while drinking was finishing anything. I've been keeping a list of stuff I complete including books games and whatever - so yeah it feels weirdly like an achievement! Better than spending my time in a misery hole of a hangover.
Struggle: I have a hard time with feelings of emptiness for days after I stop drinking it feels like I can't get enjoyment out of anything after a binge...Triumph: Only drank 2 times in the past 30 days and didn't get hammered the 2 times I did drink...General: Very happy with my level of physical fitness and that my lifts are all progressing steadily still despite my occasional falling off the wagon. I hit a new bench press PR today of 265 pounds at 145 pounds body weight so was pretty happy about that i'm closing in on my goal of double body weight. Life overall is good right now I just am having a hard time staying sober permanently I keep binging every month or so because I start to think about the good times I had with alcohol. Only to remember afterwards that they don't exist anymore and that I don't feel the same after drinking now as I used to when I was a teen or in college. I just feel empty inside and anxious for days and sometimes weeks after.
Day 115. It's all about the Z for me today! Z being Zoloft...Struggle: I started Zoloft on Monday and today I feel very dizzy. I had to call in to work and I'm sick of feeling like crap in general. I want to feel better but SSRI's take a few weeks to really kick in and for the side effects to subside. As for sobriety... somehow it makes me want to drink more knowing I "can't" on this medication and before starting it I considered just picking up drinking again because I felt better back then. Sobriety isn't the wonderful carefree land I wanted it to be. Turns out alcohol abuse wasn't my only issue. Still sticking with it though...Triumph: Finally TAKING the Zoloft. It sucks but quitting drinking and smoking took away the crutches I was using to cope with my depression. I spiraled. Now I need help to climb out of it. Taking the pill was the first step. I'm proud of myself for it even though I kinda feel like crap today and I think the meds are to blame. Hopefully it'll pass and soon...General: Basically that's it. Zoloft is the main change in my life lately. I haven't cried at work in a few days. That's nice. I hope these side effects go away. I'm still glad I went sober. That way I can process my emotions instead of using booze to forget them. It feels like a healthy step for my mental health. Still sucks right now though.
Struggle: My husband had been struggling with school lately and is possibly going to quit. I'm worried for him because he's been depressed because of it. He's always a very happy person and it's difficult for me to see him struggle so much with this especially since it seems like there's nothing that I can do to help. My excuse (not reason) to start drinking heavily again started with stress over him struggling with school last semester and I know that me being a mess definitely didn't help him at all. At least I can stay strong and sober to support him in any decision he makes...Success: I'm so much more productive at work now that I'm not either drunk or hungover (imagine that)! I do contract labor from home and my numbers have been way up since I quit drinking. It's really refreshing to see such an obvious and measurable benefit of my sobriety. ..General: My sister came to visit from out of town and went to some AA meetings with me this past week. I an really grateful for her help and support. She had to go back yesterday and I am already missing her but looking forward to seeing her again sometime this summer for some more fun sober adventures. I will not drink today!
One of my goals was to make it to 50 before needing a crown.  I am a classic dentophobe.  So 17 days shy of my 50th BD I snap a corner off a molar on a seed.  Day-um!  I call the dental office and they say that my regular guy is off.  Does it hurt?  No.  Do you want to wait for regular guy?  Sure I feel comfortable with him.  So 17 days later I'm in the chair to be ground away on and my dentists asks "did we meet first socially or professionally?"  I look up.  Oh shit Jxxxxxx!   I am so tunnel visioned when in the chair that I did not even realize that I had known my dentist from AA for a few years.  And people say that there isn't a god.
Truimph: i have a job interview tomorrow that seems really promising. My friend works for the company and put in a really good word for me and they are desperate for people atm so it sounds like I already have it. I interviewed there two years ago with the old manager who offered me the position but turned it down at the time because I was gearing up to start competing in barista competitions...Struggle: I have to call out of work to go to the interview. Unfortunately due to circumstances there is no other way. I've only been at this current job for three weeks and know that it'll look really bad if I call out tomorrow and I'm worried about the off chance I don't get the job what will happen.
Hi Mary I'm thinking of you and hoping that all goes well. I want you to always be in great health and feeling great!..Lighting a candle for you and sending warm hugs my dear SBFF &lt;3 xo
Struggle: I finished my last exam today and thought it would be a great excuse to drink. My friend who I had dinner plans with had to go out of town for work and my AA friend was busy. ..Triumph: I decided it was be a better use of my time money and body if I made a tofu curry and went for a 5km jog. The jog is my second this year and it was hell and hard but I'm slowly gaining my stamina back (used to run a good 8km easy before my relapse last year)..General: If I didn't have AA friends as well as my family who I will see tomorrow to celebrate my graduation I would not be alive today. This community is a huge help too! IWNDWYT
Shit Mary I'm really sorry about the medical news. That sucks. You are doing so much good for your health and your well-being it must be frustrating. On the other hand you're spot on with that quote. Things go from "How can I deal with this horrible reality without drinking?" to "How the hell would I endure this horrible reality without sobriety?" pretty fast all things said. ..**Struggle:** Taxes and Marriage...**Triumph:** Job offer success. The official offer will come in next week but I got the word that it **is** coming and we talked **actual** money. FINALLY. I expect another offer to come in late this week or early next week so I will get to choose which I'm both thrilled about and also already totally torn over. Public or Private Sector. Hmm. I'm leaning toward public...**General:** Did you know only about 3% of birds have penises? Well now you do.
