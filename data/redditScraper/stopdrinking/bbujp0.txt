I've been drinking heavily every day for a couple years but for the most part I don't drink from 2am to 2pm. the past week however i've been on a bender where i've pretty much been drunk the entire time and now that i'm sobering up i've been shaking/puking/struggling to eat. then I had two shots and felt fine. am I suffering from withdrawals? do I need medical help for this scenario? any help is appreciated thanks

Yes that is withdrawal. It peaks 48-72 hours after your last drink and can be a dangerous medical emergency if it is bad enough. Talk to your doctor...you may be prescribed medication to help at home or may have to go to detox depending on how much you have been drinking. Good luck.
Withdrawals. See a doctor ASAP.
