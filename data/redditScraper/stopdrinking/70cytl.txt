Hi everyone.  Today is day 14 sober!!!..I got off work early today and instantly wanted a drink. ..Instead I went to a piercing shop and finally got a daith piercing in hopes of helping with the migraines I have struggled with since high school...It hurt like hell and I immediately broke out in a sweat...Walking back out to my car I noticed an odd musty/ammonia smell.  I thought it was something outside until I got home and could still smell it...It's ME!! An hour later I can still smell it. I have washed my hands several times and my palms still smell...One of the cats ran away when I picked him up to cuddle...WHAT THE HELL IS THIS SMELL?!?!.....

I don't know but a few times I cried and my tears seemed like their was an ammonia taste or odor.  
Congratulations. It's coming out of you. Now your body is purging your fat reserves. It's cleaning itself up. :)
It could be an indication of unhealthy liver or kidney function. 
That's interesting I found out I have trouble processing ammonia and it was causing fibromyalgia symptoms. I take malic acid magnesium and a bit of l-carnatine for it. My fibro pain levels are basically zero when I stay away from booze. It's a damn good motivator
