I'm sorry you are struggling so much. Today it seams like the the world is caving in on us and there is no way out. ...But deep down inside you know the way out. You know it won't be easy you know it won't be fast and that is very scary. All those traps waiting to keep you under to not let you get out....All of us are in the same boat. So what that you gained weight you can lose it. OK you had a relapse but here you are today fighting!....Pour that fucking poison down the drain! I did. It was March 18. I just finished my obligatory bottle of wine and opened the bottle of vodka. I was sitting on my bed and took a sip straight from the bottle. I was crying because I hated myself. I hated my life and what a mess I made of it....Had to go to the bathroom and in the mirror I saw an old pathetic lonely creature with red puffy eyes and messy hair. I grabbed that bottle and poured down the drain. ...You are worth to have a sober life and future. There are people who care about you and want the best for you. ...Wat do YOU want?...Internet hugs and be kind to yourself. I will be cheering for you :)...IWNDWYT :)
Sometimes it feels like every bus is the struggle bus. Sorry you're struggling. Have you heard of [Kindling] (https://www.recoveryfirst.org/blog/the-kindling-effect-of-addiction/)? It's hell on your body when you keep stopping and starting drinking. Do you have outside support other than your doctor? Having a community behind you can make all the difference.
