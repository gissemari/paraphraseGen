Good morning/afternoon    .Theme: Though Love    . .**"Stop running to the bottle every time you experience a little pain it gets you no where but deeper in your hole."- My Mentor**    .What I got from it: In the beginning of my recovery I was a conic relapser when life got hard. He tried to encourage me he tried to inspire me he tried to coddle me but honestly what got through to me the most was when he laid it out hard and straight. I didn't like it at the time but that had the biggest impact.

Yeah. Something I've had to learn is to keep my sobriety separate from the ups and downs of everyday life. Learning that and the fact that drinking is actually much harder than staying sober for me have been indispensable tools. 
This seems like it's pretty much the crux of sobriety.  Your mentor sounds cool.
Good one.
