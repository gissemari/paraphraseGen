A few days ago I moved across the country to be with my boyfriend after months of LDR. We lived together for around a year prior to this. ..We got in our first fight since the move and I'm feeling a little bit of a blow to my 30 day sobriety high. He was with me for the worst of my worst and I still have a lot of guilt from that. I've done a lot to take accountability for myself and I'm really proud of the work I've done. But sometimes I worry that it will never be enough and that I will always fall short and end up letting him down. ..He is extremely sharp witted and when we used to fight I would struggle to keep up or  defend  myself due to my mental cloudiness. I never felt that I could properly express myself unless I was drunk but even then it would be just raw illogical emotional and that's never conducive to solution or compromise. After fights I would just leave and go get drunk at a bar. Or sit on the sidewalk outside the 711 with those weird juice box wine things in a paper bag.  I really hate myself for how I handled that and I know that that hurt him. That's been one of my main motivations for sobriety. ..Now with a tiny bit of time under my belt I can see how blame deflecting his argument strategies can be. I'm no longer willing to be the guilt sponge anymore. Sober me doesn't just allow myself to be talked over or played out. I also don't just counter attack everything he says. I process and listen. But in doing that I still value my emotions. ..This makes me really angry and it also makes me want to drink. But I won't because then he will just be right. I know that's a shitty reason to be sober but it's a reason so I'll take it. ..I'd rather be drunk and validated in my pissed off shitty victimy bullshit but IWNDWYT...

Don't drink! Now that you're sober your relationship dynamics may appear in a new light. Allowing yourself to process that and feel it will help you see things clearly and respond from a place of authenticity. You are worthy of love and respect no matter what.
Don't drink - no amount of alcohol will make this situation any better friend! ..I feel you in this - prior to sobriety(the first time) I was an easy target for my boyfriend and also the source of a lot of resentment too. ..He would bring things up I wouldn't be able to clearly remember or have the ability to defend so I'd just accept apologize or agree with what he said. Once I got a little bit of sobriety under my belt my brain fog subsided and I'd realize some things didn't play out exactly as he shared them and he was very assertive. It angered me at first and wanted to fight back or stick up for myself - and honestly in the heat of the moment it just made things worse. We both ended up focusing on who was right and who's facts were legit rather than solving the problem...Maybe try giving him and yourself a break for now. Realize he may have some built of resentment or fear from your drinking days and that's OK you can work through it. You don't need to carry anymore guilt either... give yourself a break - and a pat on the back for being a sober human!!! ..When things are calm try approaching him and asking to set boundaries for both of you in arguments... even ask his suggestions. We now have rules: stick to the topic at hand have a resolution already in mind but be open minded in solving (so we aren't just bitching to bitch) no name calling (totally guilty) no passive aggressiveness (his specialty.) It's not perfect but it's helped us work through disagreements. ..You're doing awesome adjusting to living together moving across country and getting sober is a lot to deal with but nothing you can't handle! Take it one moment at a time! .IWNDWYT
...and first EXCELLENT job venting your emotions in a positive way and in a healthy forum. Give yourself a lot of credit for that. You rock. Keep on kicking ass!
Not drinking makes us smarter.  It keeps us aware and alert.  Quitting drinking can make us warriors and builds valuable life skills.  The rub?  We gotta *stay* sober to enjoy the upskills of sobriety.  Or as I like to view it now that I'm out I *get* to *stay* sober thank you very much   ..Courage girl your doing Very Well and you will know this better and better the longer you stick with the sober abilities.  They grow.  You'll appreciate it.  Trust the process!  I will not drink with you where you are in your new digs you are not alone out there.     
**hug!** don't forget: you are a strong independent human being with amazing resources.
