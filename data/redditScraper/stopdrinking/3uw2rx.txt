The only thing I feel that kept me sober tonite was calling a friend from AA. I had the perfect two weeks of not drinking and no urges. Today it was like my head just snapped and I suddenly found myself with really intense cravings and planning to go buy a bottle of wine and 8+ beers. At the same time I felt relieve and intense depression as if I had already relapsed...I went to my first AA meeting two weeks ago met these great people who gave me their numbers which to call if I feel the urge. .I almost didn't call but I knew I wanted/had to. At the same time my alcoholic brain was telling me to go buy some devastation...I feel it literally saved my sorry butt tonite. I would be so drunk and miserable right now if it wasnt for that another alcoholic in need. ..I just want to say that if you feel feel like relapsing call someone write here be in touch with someone who *gets you*. Thanks for letting me vent...

Thank you good job on reaching out. Last relapse I had I didn't and I was out for the count for 2.5 weeks. I got that urge again at about 30 days this time just like a mania and I take everything wrong. I did what I was supposed to do reached out meditated wrote out my frustrations and even prayed and it went away. But reaching out is such a valuable tool. Keep up the good fight friend!
Good job /u/miyazakimm -- what lesson would I want to learn from this?
Nice work!
Right on!!!!  
Great job on countering the urge.  It's amazing how it can seem so easy at times and other times it's like someone is screaming in your brain to have a drink.
Great job!  Sometimes all we need is another level headed person to really put things into perspective.
