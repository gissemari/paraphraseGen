I've been avoiding this sub out of shame for the last couple of months. I fell back into my predictable hole of being a drunk isolated wreck for the last two months. What snapped me out of it this time was having to take a friend of mine to the ER for their drinking and mental health issues. I tried to kill myself 10 months ago while in a drunken stupor and that should have been a wake up call for me. Apparently it takes seeing someone else struggle with the exact issues I have to make me take a hard look at myself. ..I didn't drink yesterday I choose not to drink today. I am very much afraid of verbalizing all of this and most of all I'm afraid of living my life without my best friend lover and worst enemy - alcohol. ..Thanks for listening reddit.
