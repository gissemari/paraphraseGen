 You are struggling .I see it I feel it I hurt for you.  But I must tell you dear friend I believe with all my heart that you will emerge somehow wiser stronger and more aware.  Hold onto that thought tuck it away in a corner of your heart until the hurt melts enough for the learning to have meaning.   -Sue Mitchell.

Thank you! That is a really beautiful way to think about struggling through difficult times! Congratulations on time sober! **93 DAYS!!!** I hope things are getting easier for you with continued sobriety. They definitely are for me.
Great quote...Anytime I'm feeling a struggle or maybe even ' life's not fair!'  ; I watch this short clip about hope and inspiration.  Then I "feel stronger!"  ..https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ihGCj5mfCk8..
Thank you for sharing. ..I am almost at 30 days and I feel somewhat vibrant more alive but emotionally I can be all over the map depending on the day. ..Late at night I still get overwhelming thoughts of the past/present hurt that I am trying to figure out the root of it all (besides drinking) to where I can be wiser more aware in the future. 
Page 124 of the Big Book says:..This painful past may be of infinite value to other families still struggling with their problem. We think each family which has been relieved owes something to those who have not and when the occasion requires each member of it should be only too willing to bring former mistakes no matter how grievous out of their hiding places. Showing others who suffer how we were given help is the very thing which makes life seem so worth while to us now. Cling to the thought that [. . .] the dark past is the greatest possession you have-the key to life and happiness for others. With it you can avert death and misery for [others]..
Congratulations on 93 days!!!! Sometimes all I need to hear is that I will be ok. Not "it" "life" "work" etc... But ME. I will be ok. Thank you for sharing.
