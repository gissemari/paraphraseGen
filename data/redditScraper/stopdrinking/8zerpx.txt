That's 2 years if you're doing the math. I posted last year on my [1-year anniversary](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/6nqgaz/a_year_ago_today/) about how I had hit my rock bottom. I took that first year and fully immersed myself into AA and checking in with SD every day. This last year I have focused more on my life and my wife. I don't go to many meetings anymore. I know that I should go to meetings not so much for myself but to help another man who is struggling with their Day 1 like I was. Not to make excuses but life has happened to me and I do what I feel I am able. At [600 Days](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/832h6r/600_days_and_my_life_has_literally_changed/) I posted that my life had literally changed. My wife was pregnant with our first child - something that I just couldn't have imagined when I was still drinking. Today I'm excited to say that my wife is still pregnant but we officially hit 37-weeks yesterday so we have a full-term baby that could arrive any day now. At any moment I will be a dad to a little boy who will receive nothing but love and support from me. He will never have to see me drunk or see me turn down very opportunity to be a part of his life...Just [a couple months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/8iq60l/healthy_habits_in_sobriety/) I posted about the healthy habits in sobriety. I continue to live a happy healthy life - this morning I ran 5.8 miles. I just got back from a lunch with a wonderful coworker and friend of mine to celebrate this milestone in my life. It was great to talk and listen to her and to know that sobriety and our love of healthy habits have brought us closer...Maybe today is your first day and you can't imagine how this can get better. For me I saw amazing results when I decided to get into action 2 years ago. I have done so much to get this far and I'll continue to work hard for my sobriety. It doesn't always feel easy but this new life is way easier and better than the one I was living before...So to all of you - IWNDWYT!
