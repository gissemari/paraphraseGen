New to this subreddit as of 2019. Posting here more for a personal reference but would love to hear more about how people manage to keep their sobriety in check while still being able to go out to parties / bars etc. Don't want to cut that out as I dont want to miss out on meeting friends and today I managed to again keep it in check but it was a struggle! Also curious to hear what you drink when you are out

My friends and I got dinner before Christmas and wanted to go out for "another drink"... I was super nervous. Everyone else got booze. I sheepishly asked for a Seltzer with lemon...But it was a fun time. Still laughed still caught up with everybody. ..I had to drive anyway one drink would make me want more and I'd strand my car. ..But really I was just thirsty. Seltzer is tasty. ..Don't try to replace alcohol though. You surely aren't there just to consume special beverages.
I avoided bars and parties for the first few months. I had relapsed in such situations many times and I finally figured out that I had to avoid "tests" or other risky situations to protect my sobriety...Was I lonely? Bored? Climbing the walls? Yes to all of the above...After some time I reintegrated a bit but honestly - bars are boring sober. Drunks are boring sober. Parties can be fun but when people start getting sloppy I bounce - it's just tiresome...I felt like I was missing out at first but in reality I'd done the party/bar/whatever thing to death. I knew what was going to happen - nothing really new ever happened. I eventually developed other interests (playing the bass racing cars fitness) and those occupy my time...I don't miss bars anymore.
