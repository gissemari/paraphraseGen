It's not a problem.  I don't drink that often and it's a way for me to relax and enjoy my time off.  ..That's my thought process.  Then I have an internal struggle. I think about my health.  The hang over.  The grumpy morning after attitude.  I think of the time wasted.  The transition from social drinker to solo drinker.  Do I enjoy the taste or is it just my bodies way of tricking me into the poison? Would I want my kids to be like this?..The truth is I thought I loved and hated alcohol in the same vain.  It's a painful paradox.  It solves issues short term and makes them worse long term.  It used to mean adventure for me.  It would curb my social insecurity and let me express my personality.  Now it just taunts me hurts me and psychologically chips away at my mind.  ..What I have come to realise is I now hate alcohol much more than I enjoy it.  In fact I absolutely f##$#g hate alcohol for the struggle it has given me and all of you in this sub.  I'm fighting it head on and I'm going to destroy it.

What I realized after being sober for a while: Alcohol only helped me to mask what was wrong with me it didn't make me better in any way. Without that toxic and treacherous crutch I can finally become my true self but it takes some work.
You and I have very similar struggles with our thoughts.   Thanks a bunch for sharing the post.  
I'm with you.  Fuck alcohol.
I once said aloud  I hate alcohol  and my boyfriend said  You love it.  I laughed. I could see how he could think that. Iwndwyt
