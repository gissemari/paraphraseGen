So I think I know what I've been doing wrong this whole time. Last year I had two 100+ day runs almost back-to-back. I felt great. I was losing weight and getting to the gym and setting goals and all the good stuff and then I started with the one or two drinks thing again. ..And I'll be honest: That's always the problem but not for the normal reasons. I really can (and do) stop at one or two and I honestly can go a few weeks between drinking. I've never hit rock bottom or even been drunk for multiple days at a time. The problem is that I'm very sensitive to any and all outside influences (hormone shifts lights caffeine pretty much anything. It's ridiculous.) and even a couple beers at night radically alters how I feel the next day. I wake up with all the anxiety at 3 a.m. even after a glass of wine with dinner. You would think this would be reason enough to stop but it isn't. I'm addicted to self medicating so I don't sleep well have the caffeine I know will feel great for about an hour and then make my chest hurt with anxiety and then have to find something to chill me out in the evenings.  It's a stupid cycle I just struggle to stop. And sometimes that makes me feel like garbage about myself so I overindulge in stuff I like (drinking eating orgasms etc.) and the cycle continues... I know I know: Play stupid games; win stupid prizes. ..However I realized how much the mediocrity of my self-doubt and loathing is absolutely killing me decided to quit settling for it reset my badge after 7-ish months of this Most Boring Roller Coaster Ever. I feel tentatively positive again. In fact I got 4 days in noticed I was having some serious Seasonal Affective Disorder bullshit had a triggering conversation with my mom and still opted to only drink water and smoothies. In fact for a change this week my self-care has been front and center but in a way that's taking my personal inventory minute-by-minute and fighting my self-loathy thoughts off like my life depends on it. This is total first for me and I'm trying not to beat myself up anymore about all these times I've "failed" mostly because self-defeatism was boring a long long time ago and I'm ready for something new...For the very first time since I started trying to make myself better I'm being gentle with myself and feeling genuinely proud of me for trying again instead of functioning from a place of deep shame and embarrassment. That's not nothin'.  ..Thanks for being here still and giving me space to share. IWNDWYT
