Have you eaten recently?  A full stomach always helped me turn the volume down on cravings from an 11 to 2 or 3.
I gnaw on candy and chug sparkling water when the urge hits. I'm only on Day 6 but it's working for me!
I'm on day five and no this exact feeling. Hang in there. You are not alone. Reach out if you need to I could use a friend to journey with myself. Thanks. IWNDWYT
HALT (Hungry angry lonely tired) works well for me (I also consider boredom and habit as big triggers). Just acknowledging the trigger makes the craving more manageable for me and gives me something else to focus on fixing
