hello! happened to find this sub kind of randomly but i'm glad i did! i'm about two months sober now give or take! it's been a struggle i admit but i'm glad to see how i've overcome it this far. ..one of my thankful moments so far i went out to a comedy show the other day with my sister and her friends and my sister offered me a soda or water instead of an alcoholic drink :') it's the thought that counts!
