Hey well done on making that first step! Some things that have helped me along the way;..1. Reading This Naked Mind. It will change how you see sobriety and intoxication it will be one of the biggest reasons for my (hopefully) successful sobriety to come. You can even download a copy of it (for FREE!) to the right of SD on the side bar under Sunday solutions. I am yet to finish it but it's very well written...2. The SD IRC chat room also on the sidebar. It's a good place for support and accountability. it keeps me going and I have learned so many tools and coping mechanisms from the people there...3. Replacing alcohol with lifestyle coping mechanisms and routine. This is key for me. I went 11 days recently and this is what got me through. A slip in my routine was what lead me back to a relapse. You need to improve your life and yourself and everything you can about it to thrive in sobriety!..4. RESEARCH! READ! WATCH! Youtube videos SD everything you've got to learn everything you can about this what this pattern is how to break it why you should break it how to keep it broken and why it's worth breaking...5. Forgive yourself. Addiction/alcohol problems can happen to anyone who drinks regularly. It really does happen and it doesn't discriminate. Rich poor young old all classes all countries. Forgive yourself. And slip ups may well happen along the way. Learn from them and move on with an improved plan. But don't *ever* give up!
Congrats on choosing today to stop - we are all here cheering you on. One of my favorite tools is playing the tape forward. When I think about having a drink I use this tool and it always ends UGLY. Wishing you much success on your sober journey. I will not drink with you today.
