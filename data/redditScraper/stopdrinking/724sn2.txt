My new morning ritual:-) OK it's only day 2 but I'll take. So this morning instead of struggling to remember how I got to bed last night (not to mention what I said and did) and trying to convince myself that I don't feel as crappy as I actually do. I'm on this site reading inspiring stories and feeling for those of us that are struggling to finally shed the 1000 lb gorilla on our back.....started out as a baby playful and fun but eventually turned in to a dominating force that would not leave my alone! I've gone a lot farther with this analogy in my head... but I'll leave there for now. I will not drink with you today
