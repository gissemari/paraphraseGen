About to go pick up some Timmies for the family. I feel like dropping by the liquor store though on the way home. Going insane right now. The urge is there but I know it'll be hell if I drink. That drunk feeling though. It's haunting me. Wants to have me back!

If I drink I will feel good for two hours... then I will have a terrible hangover and feel shame guilt remorse. It's not worth it. It's your choice. 
I just walked through DMs (Had to cross through the building) and ran into someone who tried extremely hard to destroy my career... obviously in their mind that's not what they were trying to do or forgot how they had behaved. He was standing at the checkout with a case on the trolley waiting to be served. I tried to look away but it was too late I politely said "Hi" and as I walked away just heard "Shit mate you're looking well... What you been doing?" ..I was somewhat gobsmacked turned and said "thanks" and just kept walking. The life changes you're making in the first few days will shape the future you live... Stay strong bud!
I feel that but remember that drunk feeling is overrated. Im sure you could do without. It's a couple hours of feeling ok and then the next 24-whatever hours feeling like shit in all aspects. Hope you stay strong. It's hard but worth it. 
I was getting some cravings as well. Just did a workout at home. Worked great! Stay strong! I will not drink with you today.
