I have been caught in an odd loop in which I never made it to 3 days without drinking. At best the loop looked like this: ..* **Day Zero**: Gets drunk. Always think I can moderate always fail and only stop when I pass out or there is just no access to booze..* **Day 1**: Hangover day full of regret and my body hating my choices again. I swear to stop drinking. Why do I even do it? I don't even enjoy it anymore. Start feeling OKish only by end of day..* **Day 2**: Feels good to wake up not hungover! Nice. I actually had a decent sleep. Feel productive. Yeah! This is what being sober is all about. .* **Day 3 / Day Zero**: I am sure I have the hang of this now. I'll have one or two drinks and call it quits. I mean come on! Who is in control here? Of course I am. As long as I don't get drunk I'm sober right?... And  then a few hours later: passes out drunk...I have been struggling with this pattern for a very very long time. Years. I have been serious about stopping many times but never made it. Heck I still haven't made it. ..I wanted to share with you all though that for the first time since I can remember really it has been 3 solid days sober for me. And that is a big accomplishment and it has been thanks to this group. I have been lurking for months and a few days ago I decided to start sharing and being involved. ..Onwards through day 4! ..My best of vibes to all of you regardless of where you are in your journey. ..edit: formatting / spelling.
