Thank you for your stories. Thank you for sharing your wisdom and struggles. Thank you for your support. I know I'm early on in my sobriety but every night since I stopped drinking I have had dreams of drinking and in these dreams I've had to reset my badge. So lastly thank you for allowing me to hold myself responsible. I will not drink with you today!

I'm staying sober right along with you today! Thank you for your post  - I can relate to being grateful for what people share here it's been a huge help to me.
You're doing awesome! 4 days that's like past the hump of one week which i thought was a huge breakthru. Keep it up.
