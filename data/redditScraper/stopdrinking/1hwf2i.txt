Hello All..I was reading the "Big Book" of AA last night and came by this quote in "The Doctors Opinion" that I think people should remember. ..*" They are always "going on for keeps." They are over-remorseful and make many resolutions but never decisions." - Dr.  William Silkworth*..I'm currently in an IOP (Intensive Out Patient) rehab here in Colorado for both alcohol and drugs. For the past six weeks I have seen people have major up's and down's and suffer major guilt and pain. Many of them relapsed and went back to drinking/drugs. In many of these cases it came down to one thing they weren't doing it for themselves.  They were making resolutions to everyone around them that this was  the last time.  What they failed to do was make the decision to help themselves. If you cant do that you make it so much harder to succeed. Now you can use family as an incentive to stay sober but they cant be the only reason. You need to save yourself not just what people think of you. ..Keep strong my friends. .

Your post makes me think of what a good friend of mine told me when I was talking to him about how I needed to quit drinking. My friend (who quit for good a year ago) pointed out to me that I was using a lot of "probably"s and "I think"s instead of more definitive language. He (correctly) pointed out that framing statements like that serves as an easy out where framing things as "I am" and "I will" represent actual steps towards improvement. ..That really resonated with me and it's been helping so far.
