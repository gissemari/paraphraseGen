I m on day one again. My estranged mother called day before yesterday and we got into stuff from 25 years ago. We somehow made it to the horrible topic of when she called me while I was in college to tell me that she was leaving my father and to come and get her. I did go get her and supported her thru it. Traumatic events happened....several of them during the next 6 months of it. I was so stressed I didn't walk thru my college grad ceremony. My father was devastated...married 25 yrs...Anyhow I flipped out when she trivialized my feelings and said that if I still had traumatic feelings about it that it was my own fault. To stop digging my own hole and get over it then she hung up on me...Some kind of pent up rage ran thru my body and I called my old AA sponsor who I talk to a lot even though I do non 12 step work. She sounded pretty upset at me cause I have been going thru a relapsing phase the last few months and she thinks it's cause I do non AA recovery work...Anyhow I feel guilty for calling her in a rage and crying and saying terrible things about my mom and I feel worse about upsetting the old sponsor than I do about drinking over the whole thing...What should I do?..

Have you considered working the 12 steps with your sponsor?
Those who mind don't matter and those that matter don't mind...I don't AA myself but it seems like maybe it's not a good sponsorship match...I'm sorry your mom said those things. You are completely entitled to your feelings and some people tend to bring out the worst in us...
I do non 12 step sobriety. Online only...but the nuthin against AA.
