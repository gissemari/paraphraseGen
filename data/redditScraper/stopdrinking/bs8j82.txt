I don't know why but I'm craving really badly right now. Earlier I noted that the craving was likely a desire to just want to take a break and relax with the errands chores etc. This month has been crazy and I've already relapsed once...Right now my SO showed me all-inclusive tickets for a food festival which always has a lot of booze. It sounds so nice to me right now... but I have to remember what happened. I had to tell my sponsor and she chewed me out a little bit I had to start over. I have to remember how good it feels to be sober and to use this opportunity to reconnect with my SO (our schedules have not been aligned much lately) SOBER and not risk getting drunk and sloppy and angry...If I voice it it takes the power away.

Have a great sober time with you SO! IWNDWYT
I've become more aware of how heavily alcohol is advertised. It's absolutely everywhere selling the idea of fun friendship and relaxation. It feels so irresponsible to me knowing just how toxic it is. Alcohol is the cigarettes of our time. The tide will shift. The acceptance will shift. And I want to be ahead of it.
Just remember... there is SUFFERING involved whether you're drinking or recovering not drinking. ..The difference is if you're drinking... the suffering NEVER ends...If your suffering the misery involved in quitting drinking... the suffering fades away after a couple of years... for forever. ..It's your choice... just know there's no way to not suffer.
