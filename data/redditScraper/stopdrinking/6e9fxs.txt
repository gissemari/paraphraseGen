Day 1. The struggle is real. I keep wanting to "let" myself drink just a little bit. It's like this sneaky little reward I give myself. I can't wait to be sober again though. I've written here before about sobriety being my super power. I just have to break the cycle of drinking I've been on. Going to get some kombucha hope it helps curb my craving..

&gt; I keep wanting to "let" myself drink just a little bit...My 'drinking mind' came up with every excuse in the book for that first sip.  Because it knew for me that's all it would take.  Great job on coming back and I won't drink with you today!
Thanks for posting that.  I've been reading a whole lot of stories with the exact story different actor.  I won't drink with you today.
