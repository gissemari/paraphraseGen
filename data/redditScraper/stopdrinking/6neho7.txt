'morning all! :)..I am reading this sub on daily basis. And I can't remember reading *a stupid post* - meaning written by someone who really has some issues with IQ. Quite a contrary - I've read "millions" of profound highly spiritual intellectual posts that amazed me. .We are so intelligent people (yep I dare to include myself :) )..Yet - we were so stupid! I doubt it was a moment that turned us from stupid to intelligent ones - I will say I *konw* we were intelligent all life. So - how come we were so stupid to the level we tried to kill ourselves slowly and painfully? How come we were so stupid to hurt everyone around us? To ignore that people love us and care about us? To ruin everything we could?..Well - this is just a little vent I guess :) And this is where sobriety leads haha. And I like it philosophy in Saturday early mornings instead of struggling to keep myself alive after failed attempt to kill myself on Friday evenings!..I will not drink today with you! Especially because I can't wait the star! :D..Stay strong!.
