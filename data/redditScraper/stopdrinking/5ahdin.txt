My rehab in SoCal required I visit a doctor to be medically cleared for rehab. My doctor is straight booked for weeks so I went to an Urgent Care on a Sunday night. They weren't going to do it at first but the doctor's nurse came out to talk to me and her doctor on duty agreed to see me. The.Physical made me cry. All he had to do was give me a green light but he sat and talked to me for a half an hour about his own struggles with addiction and told me he was proud of me. It was so compassionate. He sent the medical report today and the doctor on duty in the rehab stated that because my blood pressure was high I had to go to medically supervised and monitored detox and I couldn't do it there because my medical group is up here in far north Norcal. Except there is no detox up here. I was in tears. I called the facility and they worked out a deal with my insurance where I could go there. I'll be honest the detox feels unnecessary but hey whatever needs to happen. I'm desperate to get better and I'll do whatever it takes. Doctor knows best.

The story you tell about the doctor speaking of his own struggles really touched me. Congrats on the steps you're taking.
I'm in medical school and I hope to be like that doctor someday! I'm so happy you're getting the help you need. Best of luck to you.
