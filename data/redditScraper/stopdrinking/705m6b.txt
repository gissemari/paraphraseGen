I just read that someone on here had 11+ years and then relapsed. I'm wondering how that happens so I can prepare for down the line. I think this would be educational for everyone (both new to sobriety and those who have been around the block a few times).

I've heard a lot of people say that their relapse started when they stopped working the program. First you stop doing your daily steps. Then you lose touch with your higher power. Then you stop going to meeting. If all these things are happening and you have a bad day on top of that boom relapse.
I didn't think of myeelf as an alcoholic. I thought my husband and i were heavy drinkers sure but not alcoholics. I got pregnant and quit drinking right away. My husband continued to drink. It wss then I realize how much we drank. I told him he had to quit and he didn't.  I threaten to leave actually did but just for overnight. Anyway he quit went to AA for a while then stopped going. We didn't drink for 17 years. Raised our kids basically in an alcohol free house. Then my dad got sick. We visited him at the hospital. Upon leaving I remember it was me that said "I wish I could have one glass of wine" Anyway thats what started us drinking again. I thought with so much time sober we could handle it. It was a false sense of security that the problem went away. It never goes away. Just lays in wait. Not drinking with you today.
In the sidebar Saturday Shares there are lots of relapse stories from old timers.  I think it is usually around something really stressful or they say hey no biggie then all of a sudden it's what the fuck have I done?  Sadly some of those who relapsed didn't make it back.  Many others got right back on the saddle and are sober.  I won't drink with you today.
