So I am closing in on Day 60 (!).  ..The first 2 weeks sucked but once day 30 came and went it's been getting easier and easier.  ..As I have mentioned here during football season I manage a sports bar and have used that as a way to drink way too much...Being sober at the bar with a bunch of friends watching them get hammered sucks.  But I did it - water diet Coke from the gun and Red Bull can get me through it...But one thing I never did was actually hang out with my friends at the bar until close.  ..Last night my girlfriend my buddy and I all headed up there around 11.  ..I had 3 NA beers so it actually felt like I was hanging out with everyone still - and I had zero trigger to relapse.  Again YMMV on that one.  ..My owner (who has been sober for 15+ years) has been very supportive of my decision to quit and was excited to have me try different NA beers and told me to pick some out online and he will order me anything I want.  ..Kaliber (made by Guiness) was fantastic.  ..So the moral of the story is that I got the feeling I was with my bar friends drinking and shooting the shit all night yet still kept sober...I know they say "who cares what other people think - nobody notices what's in your glass".  ..But I do.  Sitting around pounding water while everyone does shots isn't that fun.  And sure this may have been the placebo effect but I felt like a part of that social scene that I missed last night.....And I couldn't be happier :)..Thanks again for all of your support - I will not drink with you today.

A highball glass with tonic and a lime wedge works pretty well too. ..If you ever see St. Pauli NA anywhere that's a very good one. If there's a Trader Joe's near you they have Gestetner which is also pretty nice.
NA beer contains alcohol. Trace amounts but it's in there. Might be just enough to trigger a relapse. Non-alcoholic beer is for non-alcoholics. It's a slippery slope you're on.
