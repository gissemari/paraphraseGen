So last night I thought to myself I have never really been an alcoholic so why not just have two. My story is that for the past four years I have tried to drink moderately saying to myself have no more than 3 or 4 and doing okay with that but still waking up with hangovers. I get hangovers really bad and learnt last night even after two drinks I still wake up feeling like rubbish. I lasted a full month of not drinking last month and then last night thought it would be a good idea to stop after two. The last month was fine really. I never woke up with hangovers and did feel healthier consequently I am going back to being tee-total. .. I have changed my mind again because I still woke up with a slight headache and still have it now (6 hours later) and stopping at two is pretty pointless to be honest. It will probably be harder to stop at two than not drink at all. ..The reason I said to myself last night to have two is because I thought that I would not be very attractive to women if I dont drink. I am single and also because there wouldn't be nothing wrong with having two. However there was as I woke up with a pretty bad headache this morning. I am sure I will find the right girl in time and also it would be just as annoying to have someone who stops at two anyway. The fact of the matter is that me and alcohol do not get on...No method is perfect I will probably miss the feeling of alcohol and numbing myself but I will be happier long term in not drinking at all. ..Thank you.

I can relate. One or ten I get sick. I get horribly sick immediately but keep on drinking and get terrible hangover. As you mentioned it's not worth it. Just remind yourself of that. For a long time I googled intolerance or allergic reactions to alcohol..so why keep drinking? ahaha Personally I don't find anyone less attractive or more whether they drink or not. I tried moderation too but it creeps up and becomes daily for me even just a few and a few become harder to control. Good Luck!
Speaking from personal experience back when I had 8 months sober I posted a few personal ads online saying "I don't drink".  I never got better responses in my life.
