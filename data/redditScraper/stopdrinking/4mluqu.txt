Good morning / afternoon / evening..Theme: You again..** To help yourself you must be yourself. Be the best that you can be. When you make a mistake learn from it pick yourself up and move on.    Dave Pelzer**..What I get from it: I have been struggling lately in my sobriety with being "myself". Compared to the way I was when I was drinking I have become more quiet and reserved than I use to be more thoughtful compassionate empathetic loving caring attentive etc... Oh wait.. that's not struggling ;) That's just me being myself today...Have a happy Sunday!
