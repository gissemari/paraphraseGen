I quit drinking a week ago because I wanted to and knew I needed to.  Although I was a daily drinker I felt ok about not drinking on the weekdays but struggled over the weekend.  Now it's Monday and I feel like I almost regret not drinking Friday/Saturday night.

If you drank on Friday or Saturday night do you think you could abstain during the week?..For me if I drank on the weekend then I needed to drink Monday and Tuesday for the wicked hangovers I had from the past two days.  Then I drank Wednesday because you know half way done with the week.  Then Thursday came around and its college night (even though I had graduated college 5 years before) and then its Friday all over again...Anyway do a cost/benefit analysis.  What's better for you?  Drunk or sober?
Honestly what did you lose by not drinking on Friday and Saturday night?
You must realize how ridiculous this whole thing sounds. Are you really broken up about losing something from your life that makes you think/feel that way?  Alcohol is a drug. Drugs make us say/do/think nonsensical things. Case in point. ..That feeling will pass. It just takes time. :)
