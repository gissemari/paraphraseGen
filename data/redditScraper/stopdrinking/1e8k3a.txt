Whew. Wow. Yay. ..To those new or struggling - it took me many badge resets to get here. I've explored all of the wonderful tools and suggestions offered here: AA SMART LifeRing WFS the /sd chat CBT therapy exercise and yoga! I think the straw that broke the camel's back for me was the Carr book in the side bar. [Some of my earlier thoughts on it](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1cn42s/some_thoughts_on_allen_carrs_stop_drinking_book/). Looking at drinking as something that only brings me devastation and misery gives me the perspective I need to stop romanticizing it and get on with my life...To all the /sd community thanks so much for putting up with multiple badge resets and for always being supportive and understanding. What a great group we are!..My life is so much different than it was 31 days ago. 31 days ago I was sick sad anxious and sporting terrible skin. Now I'm hopeful calm contented and so so so much happier. Here's to another day!

Great job.  Continue to live up to these challenges. 
and the freedom.....The work you've persisted with is amazing as is your fairly relentless honesty with your journey... It's nice to see. ..I hope you've packed a pocket handkerchief...
Thanks for this (shaky and anxious here) always great to read some success stories. Just lost my "introducing myself" post to a reboot and didnt feel like typing it down again right away so now I can just thank you as my first post :)
Congratulations on your accomplishment and thanks for the helpful words and advice. I'm a serial quitter and I want to just quiet for good. Thank you..
Great job cake_or_radish!  I'm really happy for you!  I thought Carr's book was really helpful too.  Funny... for me the whole time I'm reading it I was thinking "This book is ridiculous.  It's basically saying that the way to quit drinking is not to drink."  But the part that you mention ("devastation and misery") really hit home for me.  And even thinking that the book was somewhat silly the desire to drink completely left me when I was done...Keep it up c_o_r!  You're doing great!
LifeRing!! That's the name of the group I went to.  I knew there was a secular support group but couldn't remember the name.
&gt;devastation and misery ..Right on...To any lurkers who are rolling their eyes at this and saying that their drinking hasn't caused THAT many problems.... great!   This is precisely why you should quit now.   Because it's coming it's ugly and it spares no one.
&gt;Looking at drinking as something that only brings me devastation and misery gives me the perspective I need to stop romanticizing it and get on with my life...Yeah. Alcohol kicks my ass. Every. Time.
Great work! Waking up without a hangover day in/day out is the best feeling. 
Congratulations. I've got a couple days to go on about my 3rd go around striving for that first 30. This post is helping me through it. Take care 
Hell yeah! Good job! 
As I tell myself every night every sober day is another reason to stay sober. Congratulations and keep on doing what you do!
The book looks interesting but I notice there's another one (also by Allan Carr) entitled "The Easy Way to Stop Drinking." Do you have any idea what the difference is if any?.
