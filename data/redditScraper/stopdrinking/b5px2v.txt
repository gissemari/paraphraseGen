Sorry for all the posts.  I'm really struggling it's 845 and about an hour ago I realized I had a warm glass of champagne on the counter.  I need to stop drinking I have severe anxiety  and the drinking is makes it worse.

Stay strong! That glass of champagne would be a trap full of pain for me.  I'm rooting for you! You can do this. IWNDWYT
