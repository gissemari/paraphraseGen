Drinking has caused so many problems for me yet I find it incredibly hard to make it past the four day mark. I'm a 22 year old college student and I feel as if it's effecting my school and work life as well as my personal life. I have a lot going for me but quitting is the hardest thing I've ever had to do. ...I always feel loads better when I don't drink except the day after I relapse and then I feel like a failure and I always feel embarrassed from what I say or do. This tends to haunt me. So why do I keep going back? Alcohol has caused me to lose tons of money and respect from people as well as days that I don't even remember. My heart is feeling heavy but I have to keep trying. I just wish none of it ever happened and that I could be a normal young adult.....Why me?

Was definitely in your shoes not long ago. It's the hardest thing to stop drinking and inadvertantly cut yourself off from friends that still do. For me having to explain to everyone a thousand times that I don't drink anymore was frustrating to the point where I would just relapse. But in the end I decided that it was best for my family and if anyone was going to stand in the way of me getting better they weren't worth holding on to. ..Choosing sobriety isn't the easy option but it is the most rewarding. Take each day at a time be proud of yourself for doing it each time and don't look back you GOT this!
Welcome mhardesty!  I have found that there is NO situation that alcohol can't make worse.  The decision to stay sober for me is done one day at a time. That means that I can't undo what I did but I can work on the next 24 hours. So yeah I already have your first day!  Keep coming back read old posts and hang with family here that *gets* how you're feeling on this journey...I will not drink with y'all today
