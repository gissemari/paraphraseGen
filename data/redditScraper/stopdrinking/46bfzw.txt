Hi I've seen this subreddit mentioned in some article and well I've been "sober" (I'll explain the quotes) for over 7 months but I'm still struggling so I thought I'd give this place a try. ..I have a question though I haven't had a drink since last june but unfortunately booze isn't my only problem I'm still on buprenorphine for an opiate addiction I've been abusing it a bit lately (hence the "" earlier) but last week end I decided to stop messing around with it same with weed so I was wondering what's your policy towards other addictions? I understand this place is focused on alcohol there are other subreddits for other substances but it's kind of a "package" for me I can't really separate everything so I might mention other substances if I'm going to post here and I was wondering if that's okay? In the appropriate context of course and I won't ask anything completely opiate specific like about WD/tapering off bupe or things like that. I don't think there's anything about that in the guidelines.....Anyway hi SD glad to meet y'all !

Welcome to r/stopdrinking!..The focus here is on alcohol we recognize that additional addictions/addictive behaviours are common it's ok to bring it up though r/opiatesrecovery would have more opiate-specific support...We ask in the [community guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index#wiki_post_only_while_sober.) that you only post here whilst sober which means that if you're taking bupe as prescribed that's fine but if you find yourself here on a day that you're abusing it we'd prefer that you lurk.
There's a good mix of people talking about substances and about life issues that come up in sobriety. Welcome to the subreddit and congrats on 7 months...For opiate addiction /r/OpiatesRecovery is a fantastic subreddit.
Welcome- glad to have you here!
