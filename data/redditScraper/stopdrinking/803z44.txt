I dunno if it's just me or if this is a common thing. Every time I've sobered up long after withdrawals etc are over I have found myself feeling generally unwell in myself physically. Not just in the past 9 days but in the 50 days I achieved before I had to reset...I feel like I catch every cold and flu going I ache my temperature goes above or below the norm at least twice a day I have terrible headaches and I'm generally exhausted. Is this just an expected side effect my body punishing me for/working to heal from the damage I did to it did you have similar? Or do I need to see a doctor? ..At the moment it's quite demoralising and making it hard to keep up with all this. My last relapse was sparked off because I felt so unwell and achey I accepted a pill I knew I shouldn't in the hope of some relief. I see so many people saying how much better they feel how much healthier how much more vital and I feel *worse*...I just don't know what the point is of being sober and feeling unwell all the time when drinking made me so beautifully immune to pain or discomfort that I could break bones and not care.

I have heard this several times. I can either feel injuries that had long been numbed or I am finally tuning into how I actually feel. I think being hungover and exhausted can change our perception of pain. Also sitting on a barstool or recliner half the day doesn't exactly put me in a position to find out what might not be working so well. ..I also suspect that the immune system will bounce around quite a bit before leveling out. However I also wonder how closely "getting sick" once in a while is similar to being "hungover" most the time. Maybe I just always felt sick when drinking so I just didn't notice?
I am having digestive issues and feel kinda small. Like I've lost a lot of weight although the scale doesn't reflect that I've lost a lot of weight. Just a few pounds. 
Alcohol in large quantities is a painkiller.  They used to use it in the old west before dental work for crying out loud.  For my part I used to get gout when I **stopped** drinking which had my rheumatologist at a loss - I should get it **while** drinking...So my theory is I used enough booze to kill the pain.  When I stopped I still had gout but I could actually feel it when I'm sober.  Maybe you are experiencing something similar?
If you are feeling anxious about your health and get too focused on symptoms it only magnifies them. Google "gate theory of pain." You mentioned seeing an MD. Maybe that's a good idea to put your mind at ease. 
I have caught the flu and several colds this winter   But I'm still so glad I am sober!
It's been a nasty cold/flu season overall so that may not be related to sobriety at all. Medical advice never hurts but my doctor has reminded me more than once that I'd been abusing my body for years - it won't heal itself overnight...
I have been thinking the same 
I quit drinking last year for a while and it was the sickest I've ever been.  I caught cold after cold. I joked that the alcohol must have killed all the sick bugs before then. The sick finally went away back then.  This attempt the bugs came back to get me at first but they've gotten better again. Personally I think I've ravaged my body for so long and then just stopped. Now my body has to reconfigure itself to adjust to the new norm. During that process my body's other defenses are way down since it's trying to undo all the crap I've done to it over the years. Those bugs take advantage during that time. Simplistic I know but that's my 2 cents 
Not giving medical advice but I do know that any change you make to the body lowers your immune system. When I do so little as change my diet I feel sick for a couple of weeks before my body adjusts. You've just quit putting poison in your body and it may just be that it takes you a little more time to adjust.
I have never experienced what you describe.  How is your diet?  Are you eating healthy?  Taking any supplements?  Getting any movement like walking?  Hope you feel better.
