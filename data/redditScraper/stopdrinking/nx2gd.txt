Today was such a great day. Got my 60 day token and got so many awesome hugs and congrats from people in the program. I often struggle to accept my own successes and people being proud of those successes but today just felt beautiful getting such unconditional support. I am finding the strength of my own voice; my voice is worthy of being heard. Thank you all for being here through 2 months of sobriety!
