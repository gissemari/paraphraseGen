Hi fam..Just wondering what some of your new or renewed daily habits are now that the sauce is no longer part of the equation. ..I am in the early days and am struggling to find ideas as to how to fill the time and make better choices. ..I can't wait to ready your replies.

Mine is a daily reflection of gratitude in a lovely App called  HappyFeed'
I spend a lot of time on here and I have gotten a lot of reading done.
I found a new job so that takes up a lot of my free time now. I'm a pretty big foodie now too
Early morning (well early for me) coffee and waking up with my kids. Missed it a lot the last few years. Love it.
Well.. I wanted to get one of those calculators that shows how much money I've saved... but I'm pretty sure I've spent it all on tea and coffee! ..I really really enjoy it and try not to consume more than 2 caffeinated drinks per day so I have lots of herbal teas too. ..My days include doing whatever tf I want because I'm able to drive whenever I want (not just before 5pm) and I'm never hungover or anxious...IWNDWYT
I try to be very good about my planner. I'll sit down for an hour or so on Sun and make sure everything is filled out. I have it set up so half to plan out the day and the other to track how I actually spent my day and I spend a few minutes at night going thru and filling things out marking off things to do reminding myself of the upcoming week etc...
Walking and biking twice a day. Eating healthy. Meditation. Reading SD.

I meditate every day I've started praying 3-4 times a day. I do a nightly inventory (an AA thing). I do the Iching once a week &amp; ask about the next week...
Hot yoga
