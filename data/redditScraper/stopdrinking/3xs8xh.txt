I'm finally starting to feel myself again. It's pretty crazy that a detox took me two full weeks. I've been documenting here on /stopdrinking for a few reasons one of which being a reminder to myself that if I ever feel the urge to drink again I will go back and read these posts. ..I've joined a gym and go with a family member who's a personal trainer. I'm lucky in that respect. I have also started to swim again. I just banged off 550m then sat in the steam room for a bit. ..I guess my point in posting is that a lifestyle change towards fitness seems to be working for me so far. I am not strong and my cardio is slack but it can only get better with practice. ..I'm still working on self forgiveness because I honestly feel I've let myself down with the drinking relapse. Meditation recovery podcasts and AA meetings are helping me with that. ..Recovery is hard work. It is definitely better than the alternative. ..Thanks for reading and good luck to those who have chosen the sober way. ..May the Force be with you. (I saw it today lol)
