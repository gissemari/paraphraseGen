Got wine last night for the wife and I to have with dinner.  Dumped the rest this morning.  Plan to go nowhere near any stores to keep temptation at bay.  Rationalization was going crazy since the beginning of the day yesterday so it's no surprise I managed to weasel my way into it come evening.  IWNDWYT!

Glad you are right back on it. IWNDWYT!
The moment I start nurturing the idea that I just maybe may have just one that's the moment my relapse begins. Glad to see you back on track. I will not drink with you today! 
I'm planning on going out for a nice meal with hubby tonight and already have begun thinking of drinks with dinner. However I am focusing on how I would feel tomorrow even if not hungover but the disappointment the return of cravings and just saying fuck it and go for more.... I don't want that.......Maybe I'll cook at home tonight ...... ... .
