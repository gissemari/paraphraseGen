Well here I am after making the decision to no longer drink. I've had several attempts but this time feels like it. I've accepted the seriousness of it and I just don't want it influencing my life the way it has for the last 15 or so years. It's been 10 days and as I type my mouth my blood my body is screaming for a drink but my mind does not want to drink at all...The fog has lifted and now I must confront reality. This is infinitely more painful than the physical effects of withdrawal. I look back over my adult life and I see a trail of destruction not to other people but to myself...My decision has come at a time where I find myself out of work. I've never been out of work before although I've switched jobs every year or two. I've had many opportunities to make something of myself and each time I ran. I don't know if alcohol was the cause or a symptom of some other trait. Maybe both...Now I feel adrift in the middle of the ocean with no land or help in sight. It used to be easy for me to find work now I'm lucky to get an interview. Why didn't I seize those chances when I had them?..And if only that were all. I look at other decisions I have made and think if the drink helped me accept things I shouldn't have. That I ignored my own self-preservation and happiness for the needs and wants of others. Decisions that I live with the consequences of today for better or worse...This is not a fear of relapse post but an acknowledgement that stopping drinking is the easy part...Where to from here? Without a point of reference one cannot possibly determine in which direction it is best to swim..

A really smart and well educated councilor can help you sort yourself if you can find one and afford it. Alternatively you can start attending AA meetings. They're free outside of a voluntary $1 donation. They use a system of 12 steps to aid in self discovery and spiritual progress I know I just said spiritual you define that for yourself no matter what others may believe in it's completely personal. I attend AA meetings and remain an atheist no one objects.
AA meetings and following the suggested steps in recovery helped me figure it out.  Good luck to you.
