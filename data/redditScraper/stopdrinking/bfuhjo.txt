I feel so terrible right now. Physically and mentally. I would give anything to have my sobriety back right now to get this alcohol out of me. What can I do to make this pass?

Only time. Pray. Watch netflix. Read a book go for a walk. It stinks.
You still have your sobriety. Only the counter has changed.  Nbd.
I take Benadryl and try to sleep. I go for walks. I try to drink a lot of fluids and sleep. I try to do whatever I can to make the time pass like watch movies or shows. I take vitamin b12 and also milk thistle. I try to be nice to myself because hatred only makes it worse. I write down how awful I feel so that next time I will be able to read how bad it was. I've been there many many times. I'm sorry you're going through this and I hope it goes by fast... hugs to you.
Be kind to yourself. Just like you would with a dear friend.  Compassion for self is part of this journey. Don't stop trying.
Id try to remember the shitty feeling. Whenever the moment of relapse comes close again Id try to recall how bad i felt last time and how meaningless the drinking was. IWNDWYT.
Drink lots of water take some multivitamin. Eat food to power up. Go walking fresh air keep the mind on other things get a few days sober whatever it takes!
