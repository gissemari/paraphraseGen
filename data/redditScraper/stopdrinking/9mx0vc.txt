CW for stuff like abuse suicidal thoughts etc. Also a whoooole lot of text :P..First time finding this subreddit and it still feels a little awkward to talk about my sobriety but I figure that's what this place is for. I'm currently 28 years old and 28 days sober and even though it's early in the process I'm pretty hopeful about keeping it up for the forseeable future!..In the past year or two I've realized that I have issues with substance abuse/dependency mostly with alcohol and weed. I never drank or did anything illegal as a teenager and was always an honors student who followed the rules growing up but my parents became extremely controlling after I came out of the closet which was then immediately followed by me dating an emotionally abusive/controlling guy towards the end of high school and beginning of college. Those experiences kind of fucked me up in retrospect so as soon as I broke free from those controlling influences and was finally "free" to live my life for myself for the first time ever the party school environment provided the perfect environment to experiment and drown the negative feelings in binge drinking excessive drug use and promiscuity which felt like perfectly normal things to do in college. I tried things like shrooms and LSD (and had two fairly traumatic bad trips) but my main vices have always been alcohol and weed...Those habits continued to varying degrees past graduation especially when going through especially low periods of unemployment or other stressful life circumstances... but I also hung out in a lot of circles where excessive drinking/drugs/etc were normalized like the local art scene downtown bar scene Hash House Harriers ("the drinking club with a running problem") etc. Whatever negative side effects came from drinking or smoking I figured were just par for the course and nothing I couldn't handle. It all felt so completely normal for so long that it really took me a long time to realize how unhealthy those environments could be at least for me. I was surrounded by tons of people who drank WAY more than I did so my perspective for what was "average" was pretty heavily skewed for a while...Eventually I started noticing my own struggles with depression anxiety anger issues and occasional invasive suicidal thoughts and I began to notice that drinking and smoking a lot had a tendency to make me feel worse in the days afterwards. I made small efforts to cut back on how MUCH I drank/smoked and took a few breaks but they never lasted for longer than a few days or so (because what was the point in holding off for another day or week if I was just going to start back up again later?). Those short breaks were still enough to make me realize that once I got past the cranky withdrawal stage I felt a LOT better and more productive and I begin to worry that I actually had a problem that needed to be addressed sooner or later. Not to mention that even when I was drinking more moderately I'd still have the occasional weekend where I went overboard and did something stupid under the influence. Increasingly I got tired of feeling ashamed and embarrassed of myself and worried that my luck with stuff like driving drunk (which I did too much and somehow never got in an accident) would run out sooner or later...My first SERIOUS attempt at sobriety was earlier this past spring after several long months of realizing I had been depressed and feeling like shit for at least a year with increasingly recurring suicidal thoughts when I was extra stressed from work. I decided to finally start taking care of my mental health which I knew meant at least taking a break from alcohol/smoking and going to therapy. I timed it to where I had a last hurrah for Mardi Gras then challenged myself to stay sober for the 40 day duration of Lent. During this time I went to therapy as well and my therapist helped me work through various issues with my abuse and certain other experiences as well as helped me see my substance abuse issues more clearly. She told me in no uncertain terms that I showed clear signs of substance abuse and that her professional opinion was that I needed to be sober and that she didn't think I should attempt to drink or smoke in moderation because substance abuse works in cycles that are almost certain to get worse and harder to break out of the more they progress. I agreed and we ended my therapy on a high note now doing RIDICULOUSLY better mentally physically productively creatively professionally. After Lent ended I continued to be sober for another couple of weeks even managing to work at the bar I sometimes filled in at without much of a temptation to drink...Then came time for a reunion weekend for a social organization I was in in college--kind of like a non-greek fraternity but co-ed nerdy progressive and also very Animal House. It's an environment I still think fondly of and have many many friends in but which contributed pretty heavily to my college partying days. Even though I knew my therapist had told me not to I decided to test the waters and try drinking in moderation because surely that couldn't hurt right? And if it went poorly then I could just stop again...Well on the first night my self-imposed limit of two beers stretched to three which turned to 4 and within a few hours I was completely hammered and making drinks from the communal liquor/mixer table without any attempts to measure anything popping into the designated gravity bong room to smoke every half hour or so and generally just back into party mode like I'd never left. The next day I felt shitty and ashamed of myself but nihilistically figured fuck it... in for a penny in for a pound so the following night I drank more to the point of not remembering the rest of the alumni mixer. My friends say I wasn't making a fool of myself or anything (though I did stupidly drive myself back to my friend's house where I was staying) but I still really regret that I don't remember what should have been a fun and memorable night with old and new friends...After that weekend I felt ashamed of myself but didn't quite have the willpower to start all over again with a new sobriety countdown. I did actually get a lot better about drinking and smoking in moderation in the months after that (for the most part) and then became too focused on preparing for an impending cross-country move to worry much about more serious self-improvement. I moved to southern California a little over two months ago and have been job hunting and freelancing for a while... but that meant working from home which makes it WAY too easy to have a beer or two during the day or get stoned on flavored legal weed vape pens when I should be getting stuff done. More recently I started to recognize that I was starting to slip into the same old self-destructive habits and my old mental health issues were starting to come back with a vengeance. So 4 weeks ago I decided that enough is enough. I know what I need to do--I literally paid a professional to tell me what's best for me so the least I could do is follow her advice which I know from experience is best for me...So far this time has actually been a lot easier than last time... I already knew what to expect in terms of withdrawal symptoms for the first few days so I was able to power through the shitty moods and I don't know enough people here to be constantly surrounded by peer pressure or invitations to "drinks after work" like I was back home so I haven't really been tempted much. My depression has basically gone away I'm drawing all the time I'm accomplishing things that I'd been putting off for months and I'm saving a whole lot of money. In a weird way I'm sort of glad I tried and failed to drink in moderation before... I now know first-hand that my therapist was 1000% right and I don't need to even try to play with that kind of fire. I do still crave the feelings of being drunk or stoned which sucks and I guess may never go away... but keeping track of the days has been helping me stay on track and feel accomplished as has looking at all the stuff I've accomplished as a result of spending my time productively rather than getting intoxicated. Hopefully this time's the charm and I just keep racking up the days as I work on being the best version of myself :)

Happy 4 weeks to you!  You're doing life saving work here.  Good job getting therapy and deciding not to drink.  It's such a game changer.  ..I will not drink with you today.
Moving across the country is not an easy thing to do.  Congratulations on seeking professional help when you needed it.  Too many people see that as a sign of weakness but really its courageous to face fear.  4 weeks is a huge accomplishment!
