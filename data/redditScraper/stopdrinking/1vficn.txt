So two months ago I posted here that I was feeling very depressed (http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1qfzm1/6_month_check_in_feeling_meh/)...Happy to start with the fact it did not cause me to drink at all. Or even think about it. I wasn't really worried about the depression causing a relapse. ..Today I'm feeling much better. The new job I took has been going great. They do bi-weekly checkins to make sure people are doing okay and I brought up a few of the stressers I had at the time and they were very understanding.  ..I exited my relationship. She was a great girl but we were growing apart. Staying together was not good for me. I think both of us are happier apart.  ..I still keep myself pretty busy but have put a little more effort in to some forced relaxation. No cellphone or emails over Christmas break was nice.  ..Overall I'm doing much better.  ..Two of my friends have also decided to give up on the alcohol so I'm getting them copies of the easy way...That's all.Thanks /r/stopdrinking

glad you're doing well and making progress. gracefully exiting a relationship like that can be so tough. good on you (her/both) for making the decision if you truly believe happiness should be found elsewhere. i've been faced with similar decisions that i've been putting off ... 
Sorry you got so little feedback.  But I'm glad you shared and updated us on SD.  
Hey your new job sounds cool.  Forced relaxation...I guess I do that too sometimes.  "I WILL NOT work right now!  I'll do yoga or read this book instead!" Congrats on eight months.
