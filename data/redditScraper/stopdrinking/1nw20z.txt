I know it's not from withdrawls anymore. Nope it's good old sober anxiety that I have struggled with for so many years. I just started a new job (lost my last one cuz I came to work hammered) Anyway I just need some advice on how anyone has dealt with a sudden onset of panic at work. It has happened a fw times at my nw job (I've only worked 3 shifts) And I'm afraid I'm going to lose this one cuz I'm sober  not drinking..aint life a bitch??Any advice???

I know exactly what you are talking about I lived with anxiety for yearsssssss. ..&gt;I just need some advice on how anyone has dealt with a sudden onset of panic at work...With your amount of time I would suggest just staying sober for the day you can drink tomorrow. When to tomorrow comes put it off for another day perhaps an hour ten minutes?..Best thing of all you can do is go to a meeting and talk about it be the first one to share don't listen to some bastard with fifteen years get better. 
It has only been 5 days for you.  It took me a few months until I stopped getting random bouts of anxiety.  In fact I had my first ever panic attack somewhere in there.  60 days in?  I don't remember. Not fun though...Things that help me with anxiety: I exercise I don't drink caffeine I dealt with a lot of the issues that caused me anxiety.  ..That last one is important. And it does take time.  Action + time is what did it for me.
Have you ever tried asmr or tapping?..There's a sub for asmr and if you're one of the people who respond it it it's great. I think so anyway. A little drug like actually...Also here's Link to a tapping video just to see what it is I think it takes the edge off anxiety and you can do it anywhere...http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=X4EDgTc0AyQ&amp;desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DX4EDgTc0AyQ
Slowly breath in through your nose starting at the bottom of your lungs (breath with your belly) hold then breath out of your mouth pursing your lips. Repeat 15 times or as many as needed... The beginning of anxiety is the end of faith and the beginning of true faith is the end of anxiety.     - Mueller George E.
This has helped me tremendously with exactly the same thing. I had the same thing as you. Anxiety got really bad around 30-60 days sober...Try this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6kq9N9Yp6E
