So it's Tuesday morning after my big relapse on Saturday night and I'm back at work. Since I managed around 4 hours of blackout over the weekend wandering around the city (big city of 4-5 million) I'm paranoid I ran into someone I work with and made a fool of myself or that someone saw me passed out in the doorway of a shop...Logically I know that it's very unlikely but my mind is creating the most terrible scenarios and it's making me freak out a bit... My career has been going well lately and I would be devastated if one drunken relapse episode were to jeopardise that...Fortunately I have zero desire to drink so I've got that going for me!

Well at least now we know that it's the same old shite..Right down to the racing paranoid thoughts;).Welcome back...
The paranoia is the worst. I remember avoiding my friends for weeks after a horrible night/day out with them because of the shame. They would even ask me how I am doing or just try to strike up a random conversation via text and I would just ignore them because of guilt I had. It's a surprise they have stuck around for as long as they have. 
Ugh those 'blank' hours...the dread of not knowing the fear of finding out the feelings of shame and panic around seemingly everyone. I relate so well to this.....Here's hoping neither of us ever have to feel like that again!..
