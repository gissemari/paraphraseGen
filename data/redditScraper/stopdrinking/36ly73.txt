Woot Woot Wednesday! [Guess what day it is](http://imgc-cn.artprintimages.com/images/P-473-488-90/60/6067/DMZD100Z/posters/bruce-eric-kaplan-man-says-happy-hump-day-to-a-camel-who-wonders-why-did-he-just-say-tha-new-yorker-cartoon.jpg)? ..[Let's hump it out on this happy day](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/11/90/5d/11905dba9e19018fd7b5cdf763a9bb60.jpg)! Hump days are when we calibrate our sobriety check in see how our /sd buds are doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations in the format below...**Triumph**: I had a tough week and I didn't drink. I had a lot of opportunities to do so and I found myself clearly parsing each opportunity to see how "close" I was to actually accepting an offer or ordering a drink. It turns out I was never really in a danger zone or at least it didn't feel like one. Though it was very much an "option" to drink (in the same way punching myself in the throat is an "option") it was never really something that was going to happen for me. I survived experiences I haven't been able to get through sober before so that's one more brick in my sober wall. ..**Struggle**: I'm still dealing with the fallout from some crap happening last week and I'm discovering that holy shit if you don't deal with emotions and feelings they don't go away! Yeah that's Bad News Bears all the way around. When I was drinking I could just drink for a couple days/weeks until whatever was bothering me was overcome by events. Not anymore. It sucks not having my crutch. It sucks having to feel all this crap all freaking day long. The silver lining I'm trying to hold on to is that holy shit this would all be SO MUCH WORSE if I were drinking. ..**General Chat**: I don't know about you guys but there are a couple different celebrities whose sobriety I follow closely probably too closely. I'm obsessed with Jonathan Rhys Myers and I hate seeing [stuff like this](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3085247/Troubled-star-Jonathan-Rhys-Meyers-looks-worse-wear-disorientated-s-pictured-drinking-bottle-vodka-London-street.html). I remember reading about him going into rehab right when I was starting to realize I had a problem and there's the little part of me that thinks "hell if rich and famous people can't stay sober with all their resources and connections how the hell am I expected to?" Are you affected by stuff like this? What do you think about how the media covers celebrities' struggles with alcohol?..More important how are you guys doing? How has this week been for you? Let us know your triumphs and struggles!
----------immediate responses--------

**Triumph:** I'm closing in on 2 years... crazy how time flies...**Struggle:** I'm getting really burnt out with work but I'm starting to realize that only a change of career will make me really happy. The scary part is figuring out what that next step is...**General Chat:** I feel bad for celebrities it must be tremendous pressure to always be in the public eye like that. I'm a very private person so having my business in the news would be my worst nightmare.
Triumph: eating something anything.Struggle: not doing well physically but also aware that I have been hiding behind drinking.General: I can't imagine having to see pics of myself on my worst days like celebs do.
I'm starting today...woke up at 6 am with an awful headache and a dry mouth and realized I've been poisoning myself. This won't be the first time I've tried quitting but i didn't know this subreddit existed so please wish me luck and any words of advice is appreciated!
Thanks for continuing to post this Cake. Isn't it stupid that feelings won't just deal with themselves?..**Triumph** We're getting the basement in our house finished and the guys start today. The triumph is that I am not feeling grumpy and resentful about it nor am I getting anxious and worked up about the guys moving our stuff down there (weird shame issues about people seeing how I actually live. Which really isn't all that bad.) We have an old house that has needed (and will continue to need) tons of work and in the past it has not been a pleasant experience. I'm just not that concerned about it. Without even trying I'm letting go of the aspects of this situation that I can't control and I'm not angsty about it (though I do have four people on the resentments list of my 4th step related to the last renovation!)..**Struggle:** I don't even know if this counts as a struggle but I did not go to my usual Tues. night AA meeting last night. I was tired and I didn't think I'd be able to get up on time this morning if I did. I guess my struggle is time management and balancing recovery work with the rest of my life. I know it's important to keep putting time and energy into my recovery and I'm only productive in the rest of my life because I'm staying sober. But like that thread about eating yesterday pointed out figuring out self-care is important too...**General Chat** GO HAWKS!
Triumph: today marks 5 years nicotine free for me. Now on top of that I can add 4 months sober. I'm getting pretty good at this quitting thing. The new pup is adorable as hell every day I have her I love her a little more. Things at work keep getting better the owner of the restaurant I work at who is an incredible chef told me that I make a better egg white omelette than she can. That was huge for me as I'm just starting out in this industry. ..Struggle: this dog has also been quite the struggle but I knew what I was getting into when I got her. I'm looking at this as a way to grow but seriously she won't let me sleep in past 7 am. Come on dog....General chat: the witcher 3 came out this week and I've been playing the fuck out of it. I've been waiting for this game for 3 years and its finally here. 
Triumph: had a good visit with my mom! Usually there's at least one big yelling fight while she visits but this time it was good.  I can't even begin to explain how nice this feels. Forgiving her has always been hard and being able to have a softer heart towards her has taken a lot of work but it's worth it. ..Struggle: Having mom visit was good company. I live alone right now so it was just nice to have her here. The next few days might feel a little lonelier but hopefully I can talk myself into being a little bit more social. I have plans for tomorrow and will work on making at least one social plan for the weekend. ..General chat: I planted dwarf apple &amp; dwarf pear in my yard and they seem to be growing! I saw a tiny bud on each tree so my next move is to figure out how to prune them/help them grow. I have no experience with trees so it's amazing to me that they are growing! .
Triumph: things are going well and ticking along...Struggle: not much... I don't have much motivation at work and its been grey and rainy. But those are all things that I can deal with...Chat: I'm not much of a celebrity gossiper bit I do find it interesting to find out who is sober and how they're struggling so publicly.
**Triumph** Tackled two things at work that I've been avoiding..**Struggle** Running injury has me down and out of the marathon I've been training for since January.  Instead of doing water running or swimming as suggested by my PT I've been sulking and sedentary. My all or nothing attitude sucks.  So do physical therapy exercises (though I know they help)..**General Chat** have yoga mat in office will do PT exercises as prescribed today.  [Clamshells](https://video.search.yahoo.com/video/play;_ylt=A2KIo9V2rlxVGRUAZkMsnIlQ;_ylu=X3oDMTByNDY3bGRuBHNlYwNzcgRzbGsDdmlkBHZ0aWQDBGdwb3MDNQ--?p=clamshell+Exercise&amp;vid=4bea3c72b0851d3d701520ca2c8648c1&amp;l=00%3A35&amp;turl=http%3A%2F%2Fts3.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DWN.wdaGBFDiGbsOaYn6BrtzwA%26pid%3D15.1&amp;rurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DvhUxuJoTvEQ&amp;tit=ClamShell+exercises&amp;c=4&amp;sigr=11bohcndm&amp;sigt=10j82mj5k&amp;sigi=11vjjbll1&amp;age=1324406766&amp;fr2=p%3As%2Cv%3Av&amp;fr=yhs-mozilla-001&amp;hsimp=yhs-001&amp;hspart=mozilla&amp;tt=b) anyone?
Triumph: I had a really nice relaxing long weekend. My husband and I rented a car and went to a lovely hike in a part our our city we've never been to before (Lighthouse Park for any Vancouverites out there). I was feeling very grateful that day as when I was drinking I never would have wanted to do that. And I would have had to bring alcohol with me cause who can enjoy the great outdoors without booze?  Well I can now!..Struggle: I'm really procrastinating on my step 4 work. Blah. I don't have a lot of shit to deal with but the shit that is there is making me feel very icky. I am really not looking forward to the amends I'll need to make but I am very aware of why I'm doing these steps and I'm looking forward to letting this stuff go...Chat: I am very grateful I'm not a celebrity because my main reason to quit was money. If I had endless amounts of money I would have sunk WAY deeper. I have lots of respect for celebrities that get sober for this reason. The temptation must be out of this world for them...Happy hump day everyone!
**Triumph:**I've just been having more frequent moments of happiness.  I laugh genuinely and deeply sometimes and it's been a while.  Also I'm going to see my therapists today and it'll be the first session where I don't feel shitty about binge drinking...**Struggle:** My emotions are still all over the place.  I get mad and/or depressed over teeny tiny things and I feel unmotivated and stressed.  I should go find a new car and work on looking for new jobs but I just don't want to?  I feel like dealing with myself all day drains my energy why do I have to be an adult on top of it?
**Triumph**: shoutout for /u/Nika65 for helping me deal with an issue that was stressing me out. Had the best sleep in recent memory last night...**Struggle**: Today is day 6 of no caffeine and I've been super lazy all week. I have little to no motivation to do stuff and when I actually do things like cleaning it's with the bare minimum of effort. And I'm super tired by like 4-5pm. I hope this feeling goes away before I start the new job. ..**General**: In high school I started emulating the lifestyle of one of my favorite guitarists including his drinking habits.  I didn't take the time to read the parts where he got sober before I went on my own path of destruction. never got famous but developed one hell of an alcohol addiction. When I see a celebrity struggling with addiction or alcoholism or when someone dies from drug-related issues(Greg Giraldo Phillip Seymour Hoffman Heath ledger Harris Wittels come to mind) it saddens me that they died but it shows just how strong addiction is. They probably had access to resources outside of my own but they still made the choice to use. I try to use their tragedies as reminders of the right decision I made to stop drugging and drinking and I celebrate their contributions to this world by living and enjoying their works.  
**Triumph:** Kind of had a breakthrough with my therapist the other day and the reality of my situation is becoming more clear. My family life was pretty bad I didn't learn how to properly deal with it and I developed depression and alcoholism as a result. Sounds simple but it's harder to see it in such clear terms when it's happening to you...**Struggle:** My emotions are coming back and I find myself feeling very lonely and unloved. I push everyone away (I almost wrote "pushed" but I'm still doing it). I don't trust anyone. I'm scared of being hurt or lied to. I feel weak and judgmental...**General Chat:** I think the way celebrities' lives are publicized is disgusting whether they're alcoholic or not. Everyone's got problems and it makes me sick to see them paraded in magazines at grocery store counters.
Triumph: Got a new job opportunity It's not so much of a commute! ..Struggle: I've been slacking on meetings I moved and haven't found a sponsor in my new location. ..General Chat: I haven't lurked or posted here in a really long time. I    look forward to checking in on a regular basis from now on :) 
Triumph: I've been sober and clean this long. My body feels better and my head is getting back to the place is was a long time ago..Struggle: Trying to find a job and stay busy to keep my mind off drinking..Chat: I have to take my cats to the vet today that should be interesting. One of them is a rescue and really hates the crate and being picked up. 
**Triumph:** Things have been going alright with me.  Been working thirds so I try to go for a long walk and did 4 miles Monday and 3 Miles Tuesday.  Will try to get the girlfriend to go with me on a long one tonight.  Also I got[ 4 months](http://i.imgur.com/ZGZXJ4vm.jpg?1) on Monday....**Struggle:** I had a big project last week at work which I completely bombed.  Did horrible.  It sucks because I have one more retry and if that one doesn't go well I can get fired from my company.  While it's not really hurting my sobriety it still sucks....**General Chat:** Long weekend the girlfriend and I plan to get some stuff around the house done like painting and hanging some curtains.  Maybe Geocache a bit.  Grill some good food and go see Mad Max.
**Triumph**: Completed my 3rd annual 45k bike ride that I first did at 6 months sober.  That means I just hit 2 1/2 years.  Yay me...**Struggle**: Life has been rough lately.  Not too much is going my way.  But I had lunch with a great friend on Saturday and that really helped me feel better about things...**General Chat**: I try not to get too wrapped up in what celebrities do.  Many of them seem like they think they can get away with anything and are above the rules that you and I follow.
**Triumph:** I hit two months of sobriety this week! Yes! And I started a new job as well! ..**Struggle:** I am still having trouble with a break up I had two weeks into my sobriety. It's been really hard for me. Fuck. ..**General Chat:** I had an amazing AA meeting at lunch today that I'm so glad I went to. I realize that I definitely don't trust my own thoughts yet. Referring back to my struggles with the end of a relationship I've been bouncing around the different ways I can help support myself moving on but not really believing my thoughts...At today's AA meeting a bunch of comments shared touched upon what I've been thinking about and I came to realize that I trust the people at these meetings far more than I trust myself right now. And that's why I absolutely must keep going back to meetings. ..The onward struggle. Here's to a good 24 to y'all. 
**Triumph:** 37 days is **very** close to a new personal best for number of days I've quit for.  And I'm a big fan of shattering personal records so I expect to surpass this one by maybe 1000 times or so?  Who's to say I could't live to over 130?..**Struggle:** Work has been tiring and the current task I'm working on has been kicking my ass.  I literally dread coming in to work on it because it's a total pain and it's just straight up not working like it's supposed to...**General Chat:** Wow I didn't really know who Jonathan Rhys Myers is but those pictures are a great example of what booze can do to someone.  I was pretty shocked when I saw the happier times pics at the bottom of your link.  Looks like a different guy..I like Craig Ferguson's story.  [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZVWIELHQQY) I've watched probably a dozen times or more.  He's a real inspiration for me - and I don't expect he'll fall off the wagon any time soon...Congrats on another day everyone! 
Day 4 no juice! Woohoo! 
**Triumph:** Jogged (slowly) for 20 minutes in a row on Monday. Feel like I'm maybe starting to get back into shape a little...**Struggle:** No idea what to do for my thesis project. Supervisor isn't being very helpful...**Chat:** There are a few celebrities whose sobriety has motivated me. Clark Gregg who plays Phil Coulson in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. said in his AMA that he's a sober alcoholic. I know I shouldn't be happy that somebody is an alcoholic but man that guy is awesome.
A little late to the party..Triumph: I had a wake up call.Struggle: I spent all day in the ER.General Chat: I fucking love RDJ
