Hi folks...I've been thinking lately about drinking and all that and i've gotta admit to myself that i can't find any good reasons to be drinking at all. I mean it doesnt even feel good to me when i'm drunk. Quite the opposit really the dizyness the lack of self control the filter that knocks all of the random bullshit thoughts outta the way before you do and/or say it is gone or close to extinction during drunken time etc etc...I've been reading a web comic for ages and one of the protagonists in this cartoon has gone full blown alcoholic and lost her job and is currently struggling with not drinking not wanting to drink getting over her fuckups etc. And i must admit i can fully relate to her situation (although i've never been fired or injured while drinking) my thought at the moment is that it's really hard to recognise a pattern when you're in the midst of it kinda like not being able to see the forrest for all the trees. but on the other hand recognise and sympathise with another person in the same shitty situation even a fictional one once you're "on the outside" ya know? This makes me really appreciative of having you guys around so i can vent and learn from ya'll so thank you guys and keep up on not drinking! ^-^
