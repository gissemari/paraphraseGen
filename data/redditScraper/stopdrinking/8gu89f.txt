"Success is an active process of accomplishments along the way" -Sober Time app..I feel amazing! Still learning ways to occupy my time but I think I'll get back to my old hobbies. Couldn't have done it without the help of a doctor honestly. I envy you guys who pushed through alone but we aren't all the same. I'm still strong. My first check up with the doctor after eight days I had lost eight lbs! My mind is no longer in a fog which is another great thing. I attended a wedding the other day with a lot of people drinking but I worked through it with a couple tears. It gets easier I know it and for those struggling know it will too. Proud of all of you!!

Thanks for sharing about your ten days and for pushing through those tears : ). You are very strong and growing stronger every day
Glad to hear you are doing well! Congratulations on 10 days. IWNDWYT!
: ) I'm glad you're happy..You mentioned something about the method you used to quit and I feel compelled to comment on that.  ..Whatever method we use to stop drinking is incredible if it gets us to put down the bottle.  I've heard people say that they feel since they use medication they're  cheating'.  Hey if we can cheat our way into sobriety let's do it!  Cheating alcohol out of the chance to ruin yet another life? Cool...Anywho your 10 days are 10 whole days of Freedom!  And if you don't drink today then today you win.  I'm proud of you!.IWNDWYT
