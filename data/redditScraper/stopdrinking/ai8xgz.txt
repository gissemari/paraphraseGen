Yesterday was awful I don't know if it was a perfect storm or just withdrawals but Christ it was awful ..Woke up this morning feeling tonnes better and back to work ..If anything these withdrawals are enough to put me off drinking again ..Day six is the furthest I've got in 2019 such a struggle I hope it's worth it ..IWNDWYT

Keep it up!!! You're over the hump and will start to feel leaps and bounds better each day now.
You get a fever? I got a fever like the flu or something and it feels like my ovaries hurt cept I'm a man and don't haves ovaries...kidneys?
I'm on day six but the sleep I had last night! Amazing!! I hope you sleep well tonight! I was waiting anticipating what day would I finally get a good nights sleep??!! And it came!! I got up at 6.30 this morning it's almost 7am now and I feel Tony the Tiger GRRrrEeAattTTT!!!! Longest I have gone since February 
It is worth it.  Keep going...you're doing great! Almost to a week! One day at a time brought so much good to my life. You can do this ! IWNDWYT
