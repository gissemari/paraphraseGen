Today is day #3 of sobriety. One day at a time right? I don't really struggle with drinking every day though...just weekends or when there's a deal going on at a bar and my friends all want to go out...My big weakness is Friday though. I don't have my son on Friday nights and I usually sleep at my boyfriends so it's like my brain decides all aboard the alcohol express-all systems are GO. ..So here's me crossing my fingers that I can stick to it this time and make it through a Friday without alcohol.

Day three!  Gettin er done!! 
Hey there! Day 3 here too and also Friday is a huge trigger for me. Plus I got fresh money income and an excuse for being out all evening. Will try to stay sober.
Have a good plan of action.  Consider changing your routine today.  Not forever just while you get things squared away in yourself.  Different activities make different routines possible.  You can do this.
