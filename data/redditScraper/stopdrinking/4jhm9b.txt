I'm not drinking today AGAIN! I've made it 3 full days and I find that I really want to stay clear-headed. I like me better this way. I've been struggling to stay sober (after fully realizing the delusion of "moderate" drinking) for at least 18 months. I learned that I kept giving myself permission to drink saying I would get clean sometime. Well that sometime is now. Not tomorrow or next week now. I won't drink today with all you who join me. And if my comments help someone even question their drinking I've been successful to myself! Thanks SDers.
