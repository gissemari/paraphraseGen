One of the reasons I loved to drink was it's an excuse to lay around and be drunk or nurse a hangover.  When I get sober like now and the work is piled up in front of me I get urges.  If I drink I can justify not dealing with it.  It seems my alcoholism and laziness have a symbiotic relationship.  I'm struggling right now.

You know.... some people seem to make a decision to do fun things and not work. I couldn't understand them. I couldn't do that. I was either working or fucked up having made myself too incapacitated to work. Taking time off? Couldn't do it. I felt too guilty. I couldn't stop thinking of all the shit I still had to do. I was anxiously thinking of my to do list all the time except when I drank. Being sober was like being bombarded with undone stuff. And I didn't want to do any of that stuff. I didn't have the guts to just be lazy ... or I thought of not working as laziness. I envied people who could relax. I still do..... 
Hang in there.  When I quit I went through so many things and felt so many things in the first weeks.  If life was always like that first week I wouldn't have stuck with it.  That week was rough.  But things changed as my body healed and as I learned more and more about what I was doing.
alcohol and hangovers are definitely a form of avoidance for me. I've had the same job title for years just at different jobs. If I finally stick to sobriety I might have to seriously think about growth grad school challenging myself etc. So I retreat into the routine of being halfway participating in life. All energy going towards nursing a hangover and sleeping it off to start again.
