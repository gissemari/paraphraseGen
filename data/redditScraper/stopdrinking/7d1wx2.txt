*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*. .**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**. .I'm pledging myself to not drinking today and invite you to do the same.. .Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.. .It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours lets not drink alcohol!. .---. .**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!. .What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up.. .**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.. .**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.. .---. .This post goes up at:. .    US - Night/Early Morning  .    Europe - Morning  .    Asia and Australia - Evening/Night..A link to the current Daily Check-In post  can always be found near the top of the sidebar...---.The struggle you are in today is developing the strength you need tomorrow. Don't give up.   - Robert Tews

I m on the train for a few hours to attend my uncle s funeral. Old age he s finally home bless him. It s weird to think that in *all* my extended family - six siblings on both parents  side with lots of kids and grandkids - there have only been two known drinkers (both of them violent when drunk) and never *ever* a drop of alcohol in *any* family gathering...And then there s me. Oh well...I will not drink with you today!

Checking in to say I will not drink with you today. Starting to feel a little better. Slept a little better last night. I've been ill and off work for the first time in years not sure if withdrawals or actually ill. It's took the pressure off with sleeping though but I'm going back to work tomorrow as it drives me insane! We're also coming up to the weekend and my technique before I relapsed was to tell myself  it's just another day another day I won't waste hungover or blind drunk  we all got this!

Your quote is so true! Tomorrow is always a big day but we need to focus on today. ..I will not drink today. Off to the gym for a little run (in the deep end of the pool).

I will not drink today! A little nervous because I do have a fancy work dinner with cocktails. I'm already planning on club soda and grapefruit. I've also come to the conclusion that no one really cares if I'm drinking. As long as they get a drink LOL. 
I will not drink today.
Count me in :)
I will not drink today. 
I will not drink with you today :) 
Late day. Clean dog shit out of salon (their way of saying "I don't like it when mommy's gone"?) scoop cat litters (these cats are full of shit!) restore kitchen (difference between wife being there and going to bed on time vs her not being here and me making it too late is that I leave the kitchen "as is".... *not* a good idea)..But me? I'm looking forward to this day -- this day of not drinking!

Good morning I will not drink with you today. Slow deep breaths everyone
My brother in law for the second time continually (seemingly jokingly) called me an alcoholic at dinner last night. Last time I got offended and sulked. This time I said  yep you're right. I'm an alcoholic  and it seemed to take the power away from him. We get along SO well usually so I'm not sure what this is all about besides possibly his own struggles with addiction. ..Anyway. I'm not drinking today! 
Will not drink today

Day 2 and I will not drink with you today!
I sign divorce papers today.  And not because alcohol trashed my marriage (at least on my part although my husband's drinking was definitely a factor) but because in getting sober I was able to see more clearly what was contributing to the deep dissatisfaction in my life and what I needed/wanted to do to move toward health and wholeness...I will not drink today. 
I put in a mile and a half run and did a one minute meditation this morning.  I'll not  drink with you today.

Holy shit. I didn't drink last night. Probably the first day in about 3 months. I didn't know what to do with my emotions or anxiety I had a few panic attacks and cried a lot. I assume it gets easier when you get time under your belt?

I will not drink today! I continue to struggle a bit with anxiety/insomnia but it isn't getting worse which is good. I'm amazed though at how much better I can function on little sleep than when I was drinking. I only got 5 hours last night but I feel like I got 7!

Checking in the first day. I quit for most of October then slipped up. Had a blackout drinking session on Monday night an hour's drive away from home with no car and just the "friends" I met at the show and bars. I think it's been time to quit for a long time so here we go.
