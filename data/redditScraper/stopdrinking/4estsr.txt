remembering my last decade and a half drinking i cant believe i lived my every day feeling so sick from the night before. that was no way to go thru life.  i was in chains and my only sense of freedom was to drink enough to temporarily forget my reality.  life is precious. time is precious. drinking is an evil poison that only disconnects you from how precious and beautiful your existence is.  i feel very lucky to have even had a glimpse at this truth. every day is a struggle but today i am fortunate to be alive and sober.

&gt;i was in chains..When I quit drinking I felt like I had been released from prison. It was the most wonderful sense of freedom I have ever had.
&gt; every day is a struggle but today i am fortunate to be alive and sober..I couldn't agree with you more. I am so grateful to be aware of who I was when I was a drinker and who I am now that I'm sober. I like this new life so much more than the old one. ..Some days I struggle with having wasted so much of my time but then I remember that if I hadn't done that I wouldn't be where I am right now and somehow that let's me accept it all happened the way it was supposed to :) 
True. I am still struggling with the wasted time and missed events/opportunities. Started adding up the hours and days once but decided that was a bad idea. Gotta keep moving forward. Life is very precious and now I am starting to realize I'm getting kinda old...
