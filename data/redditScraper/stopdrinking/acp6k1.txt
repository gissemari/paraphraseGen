Ive finally had it. I cant do this anymore. My work is suffering (i own 2 companies) i have no enthusiasm to do anything around the house and ive had 2 drink driving charges in the last 8 years. Not to mention the hangovers constantly feeling like shit and the empty beer bottles everywhere...Looking for suggestions or tips to keep occupied in the times when im not working and feel the urge to drink? I know i can do it i just feel as though i may struggle a bit at first.

Congrats on starting your sobriety journey!..It's a long road it's not easy but dammmm it's worth it!..The beauty of this journey is having others by your side. You've got a community of 147k+ here at SD backing you up there's a ton of recovery groups IRL and online that you can tap into and you're never alone...Interested in what happens at a recovery group meeting? Check [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index#wiki_it.27s_my_first_day.__what_do_i_need_to_know.3F) out...When I first came to SD I read/posted/commented and absorbed as much as I could here. I took advantage of the [book recommendations](https://old.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/books) hung out in our IRC and listened very closely to our wise oldtimers. The wisdom? Friggin priceless my friend...I'm proud of you for taking this bold courageous step and look forward to hearing more from you...Anything we can do to help??..
The chat has helped me a lot. Check out the side bar. I've been checking in each morning and in the evening when I would usually drink. It has helped keep me on track.
