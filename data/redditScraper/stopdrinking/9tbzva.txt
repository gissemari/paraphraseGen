So now that I'm starting to feel better physically somehow my alcoholic brain is saying have some wine tonight. Why would I want to feel bad again after finally feeling good? Does anyone struggle with this?

I think *everyone* struggles with this especially on day 5. It's a good thing that you seem to already recognize and remember that alcohol hurts you. I got through my first few weeks just forcing myself to rationalize drinking and constantly reiterating all the negative aspects of it (and the fact that I could think of zero positives). I also read This Naked Mind which was immeasurably helpful...You can do this! We are here for you.
Yes yes yes. This has always been the problem for me.  Wanting to stop drinking during and directly after a hangover is to be expected- it's when you start to feel better that the urge creeps up on you again. I've always struggled with this and that's why my day count is so low. Yet I keep trying because deep down I know it's the right thing to do and eventually it will stick once I get sick enough of feeling like crap. I hear it gets easier...? 
I'm reading as many Day 1 posts as possible to remind myself I was there just a few days ago and I will be again tomorrow if I drink today. 
Day 5 here too. I've been through that many a time maybe treat yourself to something else that you enjoy? An ice cream cone some pizza a manicure or facial if thats your thing. You can do it! Sometimes we just need a distraction.
