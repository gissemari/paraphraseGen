Hello all..So after lurking around here for some time I have to post and say how grateful I am to this community for being what it is. It is truly an inspiring place for people to discuss their demons and get the motivation and support necessary to push forward with the lives they truly want to live not the ones controlled by some exterior force or pressure...I've also decided to post a little about my struggles but do so in a different manner. See for most of my life I have been an avid writer and creator. I have loved the process or writing and storytelling and believe it to be perhaps the most intimate way of revealing one's true nature...With is being National Novel Writing Month I am embracing this as a time to actually write my first novel but do so while addressing the demons I dealt with specifically those related to alcohol and expectations of society when it comes to alcohol. I struggled with alcohol for a LONG time and have only recently really come into my own though I do still struggle with the regret and shame of having treated my body the way I did. So what am I doing? Am I going to sulk and wallow in pity? HELL NO! I'm going to use my experience channel my feelings and do so in a productive manner in order to help myself and hopefully others who go through similar experiences. ..As such I wanted to share with you all in this great community what I write. If you enjoy what you are reading I will continually post updates (daily weekly etc.) through a shareable link that will give you first raw access to my anticipated novel. It will probably never become anything worth reading but hell why not. A sober mind is a clear determined mind and I am happy to share my struggles experience and knowledge with you. It is the least I can do after you have all done so much for me...Here's the link to the first little bit I will make available for access...Any thoughts comments or critiques are strongly encouraged! I have the entire plot drawn out and outlined so if you would like information as to where the story is going to go and what it will be about I would be happy to share with you as well...Thank you all once again...[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JcCdGvXrtRc36glfKQE4WYAB2cdBnv80ZagufJKmdBA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JcCdGvXrtRc36glfKQE4WYAB2cdBnv80ZagufJKmdBA/edit?usp=sharing)
