Hello all I'm nearing a month of not drinking and am curious about AA. I've located a few meetings in my area but am having trouble deciphering the meeting types/accessibility. I want to make sure I understand things properly - "open" meetings are for anyone including family/friends and are a good place to begin while "closed" meetings are for only those struggling with alcohol though newcomers can attend correct? The meetings listed in my area do not indicate if they are open/closed meetings so I want to make sure if I show up I won't be turned away but am also being respectful of the space.   ...Thanks in advance! IWNDWYT!

Open meetings are for anyone you could bring a friend or a family member.  You will be welcome to any meeting open or closed  because the only requirement for AA membership is a desire to stop drinking.  Good luck!  Do whatever helps you... IWNDWYT  
The sidebar of the r/alcoholism subreddit has links to two articles about what it is like to go to your first meeting. Your description of open and closed is correct. You can go to either. Keep us posted. IWNDWYT
