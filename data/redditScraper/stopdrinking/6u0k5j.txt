Made it though Friday Saturday Sunday Monday and Tuesday all without drinking. Sleeping has been difficult--I don't think I've made it to sleep before 4am in the past five evenings--but I feel fantastic. ..My apartment is CLEAN. My fridge is full of vegetables delicious juices and bottles of S. Pellegrino. My skin feels younger already. My anxiety has gone way down. I've made some phone calls to loved ones I normally shy away from. The gym is calling my name and I can't wait to go. ..The best part of it all perhaps is that everyone I've told about my mission towards sobriety have been wonderfully encouraging about it saying how proud they are of me and what an inspiration I am to them. My dad said he'd join me on the ride so I'm going to try to hold him to it :)..Finally to all you lovely people here: You're keeping my boat afloat. Reading about your struggles and perseverance gives me a huge amount of hope and is the best type of motivation for me to keep on going. I believe in all of you very much. You're awesome.

Glad you're feeling good. Keep it up.
That is wonderful.  Sleep will come.  As the bad effects of alcohol are sucked out of your system by time and then maturity sleep and life in general gets easier.
