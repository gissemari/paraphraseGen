So I've been struggling with quitting for the past year. Started with the 30 day sobriety solution and I've been through it 7 times now I think? I've only fully completed it twice. My triggers are any painfully stressful situations at work going to social situations and my dad...I'm 27 and I live at home with my parents and without going into too much detail my dad is my biggest if not only drinking buddy. We have a jolly ol' time when we drink but when I'm on my sobriety stints I feel like the spark isn't there for socializing. It's hard because I really really want to be sober but I also love my dad very much. Neither of us have very many friends outside of ourselves so I feel guilty when I'm in early sobriety and I just can't even handle looking at him. I just say hello when I get home from work and storm to my room...My dad is on disability so he is home pretty much 24/7. There's not much escaping him while going through sobriety except for my room. While sober it feels suffocating but while drinking I love having him around. When I'm drinking I will pick up a small bottle of whiskey and some beers on the way home come home have a couple shots with him and drink beers and talk until 6 to watch some TV together. ..He's not as much of a problem drinker as me. He has more of a take it or leave it attitude and rarely goes overboard. Maybe 2 or 3 drinks sometimes 6 on rare occasions. I'm drinking at least 8 drinks on weekdays more on weekends and it's killing me. It's killing my finances my mental and physical health my relationships with friends and family...Anyways I'm just not sure what to do. I don't want to just abandon him because of my drinking but I also find it very difficult to quit otherwise....Any advice is appreciated.

  first thing that comes to my mind is what about taking up a hobby with him? like puzzles games creating something together? basically alter the way you interact and spend time with each other. take out alcohol and maybe get into tea? make a plan where whenever you get home from a stressful day you make a big pot of tea and play a game. there's tons of kinds of tea that could be a hobby alone! 
The first thing to do is to be honest with him and tell him how you feel.  I think he will be very supportive in your choice .  A parent wants what is best for their child and he loves you.  Heck he might even join you and kick the habit himself - but that is his choice not yours or mine. Don't ever feel bad about not drinking - it is a good choice. Don't use your dad as an excuse to be able to drink that is your choice as well. Be firm in your commitment.
