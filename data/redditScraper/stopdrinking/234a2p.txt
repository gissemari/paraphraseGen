So after months of heavy drinking almost every night for months I got sober for almost two months and was incredibly happy. ..Then I relapsed. ..I went on a furious two week bender that I am trying to crawl out of but I'm worried about withdrawal. I went sober for about 48 hours during which my face felt flush my heart would beat fast with anxiety and I wasn't sure if I was feverish or just flush. I also have this weird pressure right above my ear along the right side of my head. I've had this before and I don't even remember if it's alcohol related but I'm too scared to stop drinking. ..About three years ago I had a manic breakdown of sorts that culminated with a seizure that doctors believe came from lack of sleep and withdrawal. I spent a week in a psychiatric wing of a hospital. I don't want to go through that again.

Please go see a doctor and don't risk another seizure.  I'm glad you reached out here for support.  
A doctor is the safest option. Please seek medical assistance.
