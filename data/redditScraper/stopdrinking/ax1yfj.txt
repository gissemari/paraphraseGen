I was about 30 days in and I had a work event at a swanky resto (last Tues). ..I decided at the last minute to have a few drinks... The few drinks turned into a usual bar hop nothing crazy. Of course I was outside in the cold smoking a cigarette again. ..Wednesday. Didn't drink. ..Thursday a work partner decided to buy drinks at lunch. He was paying. So I had a few. Next thing you know I'm slowly bar hopping again. ..Friday I was exhausted. Figured a few drinks would make me feel better. So I stopped at a bar at 5pm with laptop. 2 IPAs double scotch and 1.5more strong beers with dinner later. Made myself completely dehydrated and I was irritable. I did leave half a beer there. I didn't like the feeling. ..Saturday I almost went out again. Luckily I made it home early and decided to go to bed as I planned to go the gym today with a buddy. ..Today I am thinking hey why not go for a beer. I won't. My mind is playing tricks on me!..My sleep sucked all week slammed in way too many calories and spent a little money that could have been better spent elsewhere. Bars ain't cheap. ..All day I have been regretting going out last week. My energy levels are off. A little anxiety and just a weird feeling that a drink would probably fix temporarily. ..God damn it! When will I learn this never ends well??? :-) The worst part right now is the cravings and FOMO...

I think moderation is even harder than just drinking  when and how much I want. ..My life is way better just not drinking. I can have better social interactions and stay on course. ..Sounds like you may be figuring this out as well
