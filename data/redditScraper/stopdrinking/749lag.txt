I'm having a problem staying sober for anything longer than three weeks at the moment. The problem is that since February anytime I have drank it hasn't been that much and I haven't had any crazy urge too it's just simpler to go along with having a few when all my friends are so relapsing no longer even feels like a relapse to me. I'm not scared anymore. ..BUT even given nothing bad has happened and I haven't gotten out of control or anything I spend the next few days over analyzing every thing I said or did. I become acutely aware of the way the people who I drank with are treating me in the days after we hung out. I beat myself up for spending money or accepting free drinks from acquaintances and not paying them back etc etc...Okay so it's no longer (or rather not at the moment) a matter of life and death or hitting rock bottom but it's certainly not worth this low-level anxiety. I want to be 100% in control 100% of the time so I can fully trust myself. ..I've made huge improvements in the way that I view alcohol and partying so hopefully this time I can make it stick.

Im right there with you. Getting out of control hasn't happen for quite a while but even with a few drinks the day-after anxiety is crippling and completely not worth it. 
I went out to the beach the other day.  Sun was going down.  Beautiful!  Waves were coming in tide was approaching my feet where I sat. I stood up raised my hands up high...I yelled "STOP"...Nothing happened!  The ocean continued and the waves lapped my feet and the tide came in...I'm definitely NOT in control.  ..Now I don't know you.  I'm going out on a limb here:  I bet you're not in control either...All I control is my next decision...I used to be the center of the universe and had to control everything and everybody around me.  Wow.  I got tired.  ..Now I'm just an insignificant speck.  I control my next decision.  Not the outcome...only the decision.  I do my best.  But I'm not in control...Here's a secret I learned.  I don't have to be in control to enjoy success.  ..I can give love.  Be caring.  Act kindly.  And still not be in control...I'm happy and sober.  ..I wish you health and happiness.
