Hello friends. I was curious if anyone in this subreddit also works in a bar and is living sober. I have been working with alcohol for about 10 years now and know that although it makes me strong to not participate and to have finally had enough... I want out and wish to work in a new industry. Looking for some like minded individuals who handle liquor 6-8 hours a day but also choose to stay sober. Romanticizing the days away with my clients about their drinking and then running to talking about my wreckage of a past gets old and is super hard on me... Looking forward to brighter days where I may have work in a new industry. I am 64 days sober from all substances and it's a lifestyle I wish to keep for the rest of my days on this planet. It's a thrilling ride and I have learned more about myself in these past two months than imaginable I know it can only go up from here but I am struggling in the midterm as a bartender trying to re-discover what I may do that is lucrative and engaging for work. I am on the 4th step and am co-sponsored. AA is working for me I go to one or two meetings a day and it is giving me hope I didn't have on my own. I came from a broken family with rampant substance abuse issues have been divorced warded ran away from everything in my life to come to this point now- sober and on my own full of hope that it will just keep getting better. I need my job to live but I know it's time to investigate other options to suit my lifestyle change. Any suggestions or ideas or just anyone who might have some advice or want to chat- I look forward to hearing from you :) I feel like AA needs its own sector for those who tend bar we are a rare breed.

I have some ideas if you're keen on learning technology. There's a great site my company runs that my 17 year old taught herself how to build apps. PM me if you want the url ( no this isn't click bait or spam)
i know people who have been bartenders and they handled it fine...but after awhile like you it just became dissonant with their new lifestyle and they had to get out. ..I am kind of in similar situation that you are. I work in technology but my skills are pretty specialized and the company who fired me practically purchased every similar company in the industry so I have been unemployed for years. I went from making a pretty decent living in NYC to losing my apartment and moving in with the my sister in the middle of a rural area in NJ...I am struggling where to go from here. It's tough. I pick up manual labor type of work and do computer consulting when old clients contact me for help. ..If you  want to talk bounce ideas off of etc. I am always here. PM me any time.
