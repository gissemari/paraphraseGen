After 6 months sober I'm about to go to a meeting after a 3 year relapse.  Scared about wreckage of the past amends possible jail etc.  I know I'm no where near that stuff yet this time...just needed to say it to someone.

Best to you friend. Stay strong and I will not drink with you today. Let us hear from you.
Glad you're here...Looking forward to hearing more about your journey.
I am also scared about many things as i start my sobriety journey again (after a 5 year relapse).  I'm scared to go to work tomorrow and see the people I went drinking with after work last week.  I'm scared to go back to AA meetings where I often feel out of place.  But I'm more scared to keep drinking.  It's OK to feel scared - those feelings won't kill us they just feel awful.  For today I choose not to drink. Hang in there!
