22 days ago I posted that I was frustrated because [30 days seems to be a trigger point for me](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/4tr3mc/why_does_day_30_always_make_the_gravity_pull/).  .  .22 days since then I have continued to be sober. I am having a not so great morning (Due to weight loss frustrations) but there is a silver lining! I am frustrated and annoyed but I am not considering driving out to get alcohol. My first thought was not well screw this I'm grabbing some vodka when I go out later. It was screw this dang no wait don't screw this things are actually better than they were.  .  .Mostly I wanted to say thank you all here at /r/stopdrinking for helping me through that hard day 30. I mostly lurk but that post really helped me get through a rough day. It was hard for a few days after that but it keeps getting better. That gravity is a lot weaker now and this is the longest sober time I've had in over a year. And to those of you who are struggling today you are worth staying sober.

Good for you!! I like to keep in mind when I'm not losing weight like I'd like....alcohol will toooootally not help me lose weight. Well. Except for that post hangover where you couldn't eat solids for two days...  ..But  like. The bloat that accompanies you any other time makes it not worth it.
