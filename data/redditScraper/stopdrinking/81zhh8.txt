Sigh. Sigh. Sigh. ..I relapsed yesterday night. I was doing so well so so so so well...I got sober got a therapist started taking supplements the thing is I stopped partying or going out. I mainly stayed home or went to work...Well yesterday I went out with my co workers. Got drunk and ended up having sex unprotected with this guy who was the friend of a coworker (he doesn't work with us)..I just want to die...All that therapy..All that detoxing..All that changing my life around..All that staying home..Just to go crazy the first time I went out...I'm 26 F and such behaviour is why I stopped drinking in the first place. I'd done myself so much harm and treated myself so badly. ..I was doing so so so well..Now I have to go back and tell my therapist that after 3 months of hard work I ruined everything. ..I'm so so so sad. ..I usually never hook up with anyone around work people EVER.  God I atleast used to hook up drunkenly with people outside my circle..I was so so so drunk. ..I'd stayed home for 3 months...I said I'd have one drink to attempt to  moderate'..Well the next thing some guy I just met who I didn't even like is ejaculating inside me...I'm so so so sad...I worked so hard...I worked so so hard...Now I need plan B and yet another STD test...Just 6 months after I got an abortion after a similar incident ..Why do I do this to myself? I'm able to do all I need when sober. Why do I keep doing this to myself? Why?..I say I'll moderate I'll have one. I'll go home. I can't just stay home. I should go out just once...Just one drink.......Why?..Now my depression is back. I'm hung over. I'm sore from this guy (he was rough!) and I'm in my messy apartment alone...This time 24 hours ago I was so proud of myself...I've lost it now...I've lost it...I relapsed...Oh and I begged him to tell my coworker nothing happened. I hope he doesn't but who knows. ..I'm disgusted...This is worse than before because I was doing so well and I know how that pride and accomplishment felt...My co workers were one group of people I never got wasted around or acted slutty around...This is a new low...I hate myself......

It's not all lost. Three months sober is something to be proud of.  You've proven to yourself that you can stay sober alone.  Now you've just got to work on a plan on how to handle going out and staying sober.   ..Be proud of what you've accomplished.  Acknowledge the mistake.  Dust yourself off and move forward.  Don't relive the incident in your mind over and over.  That doesn't help.  ..Imagine how NEXT time will be different and work towards that.  We do what we focus on.  Focus on the positive.
You're ok! Don't freak out! I know that's easier to say than do but you really have done great; you just discovered that you have to modify your overall strategy.  3 months is great and the personal growth there is not lost you must have been doing a lot of things really really right to get that far!   It's just about learning what to add next to extend that!
The good thing about making mistakes is that we can learn from them if we didn't make them then how can we know when things are going well we'd have nothing to judge the good stuff by and it sounds like you have lots of good stuff being sober for three months is one having a therapist and the tools there is another thing..Like the poster above says part of the success is planning don't hide yourself away you deserve to have good times this was a one off in months of good work
Hey ..Take this as an opportunity to learn. Recognize the mistakes that were made and move on with your life. Nothing you do now will change your past but it can change your future. You can decide your future right now...You don't need to make this mistake again you can find a new job you can decide to remain sober from this point and you can even raise a child if you need...Your progress is not gone! You can decide to improve...
Man oh man.  Or woman oh woman.  I have been in your shoes!  Listen everyone is right.  All the comments below.  I have done things relapsing that I WOULD NEVER do sober.  The two worst were getting a prostitute having unprotected sex and sleeping with a married woman.  Talk about shame and sorrow!  You made it 3 months and achieved a lot of personal growth.  Be proud of that.  Start again.  You're not a bad person you're human.  You made a mistake.  Ok another mistake.  So pick yourself back up.  You know you're strong enough.  You've done it before.  You're feeling the effects of a physical hangover as well.  Don't forget that.  You aren't now who you were 3 months ago.  You're better!  I will not drink with you today.
Oh Luxe sweetie...I can't say much more than all of the other great posts...except...you will be able to get that sense of   pride and accomplishment felt  back again. Don't give up. Even if it's a new low hate the **Low** and not **Yourself**. We love ya! No matter what...I will not drink with y'all today .. within  
Whilst in a perfect world everyone would decide to quit and never drink again relapses can be very useful if also painful horrible and deeply upsetting...I'm sorry you're in so much pain now but I hope what you've learned will make you stronger and better prepared next time. It might be helpful to write down what happened and how you feel physically and mentally the morning after. You can refer back to it when you start thinking moderation is a good idea...I hope your despair fades quickly. 3 months is an excellent achievement. You only drank once in 3 months. That's pretty amazing no?
You have already laid the ground work to get back on that bike (I'm a city slicker) and ride.  Everything is in place. Get on that bike and start peddling again!  You got this!  IWNDWYT
Thank you so much for sharing luxe I can so relate to your share; I'm 73 and just have 18 days without alcohol so I have experienced similar incidents like you describe over and over and over.  it breaks my heart because I know what it's like.  even tho i'm new here this is a great safe place to come and i'm proud of you.  I know it is fresh and raw but sharing is so much better than keeping it to yourself.  process as you must and then try and stay in the now thinking too much of the  past can lead to regret or depression and thinking too much of the future can lead to anxiety at least for me.  we just have today and my thoughts and prayers for a better tomorrow are with you.   
When I went back and told my therapist I had relapsed I was so freaking nervous. She just shrugged and said "I warned you you are going to make mistakes". If you are interested I listened to "Take a break from drinking" podcast episode 29. It's a good one on how to quit beating yourself up the next day. 
Thank you for posting this. You're so brave and strong to be here the day after. I teared up reading your post because I've been there MANY times before and have felt like you're feeling. I just want you to know that you're not alone. I admire you for being here today. 
I know you're disappointed to have broken a string of consecutive sober days and to have engaged in behavior you thought was behind you  but please don't beat yourself up too badly.  Many of us tried moderation all of us eventually failed. Now you know: you cannot moderate. If you never forget it this was a valuable learning experience. You haven't  ruined everything  and you will feel better tomorrow. I will not drink with you today. 
please dont be so hard on yourself! everyone makes mistakes. relapses are a part of recovery. youre doing the best you can and one day that will be enough! &lt;3
Very welcome
