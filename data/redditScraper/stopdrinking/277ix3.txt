Came out of a 3 and a half day bender Saturday. My parents picked me up from my apartment  it was the fourth time I've done something like this. I stopped answering phone calls and just drank. The last two months of my life/relationship with my now ex-gf gave me anxiety and I drank it off until my anxiety became crippling and I drank it off through Saturday. I'm doing IOP three days a week and have been prescribed lexapro for the anxiety. Last night when I explained the relapse to my group at IOP my mediator mentioned seeing a psychiatrist so we'll see how that goes. But as for today I just sit at my parents house incapable of running or going to the gym. I just have no motivation to do anything it's my third day on Lexapro and I know I'm not supposed to see it peak until 3-4 weeks but I feel like I just don't care sometimes. Other times I care so much I can't get over all of the damage I've caused in such a short time. I guess I'm just looking for experiences with any of this the lethargy the not caring the whole works. I'm committed to the IOP and will do whatever it takes but this anxiety element I'm really new at it's harder for me to get out of the hangover funk haze and get motivated.

Welcome /u/HighRoad10 --weren't you on this Sub in the past year?  In which case welcome back.  IOP sounds like a good first place to start after your recent battle with the bottle.  IOP will help you deal with the isolation aspect of bottom drinking.  But YOU need to move the feet don't just trust that sitting in an IOP class suffices for the action required to get and stay sober...We will be here as you go along.
