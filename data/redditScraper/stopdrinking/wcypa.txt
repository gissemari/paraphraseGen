What does /r/stopdrinking think of setting up a system where we have a thread everyday where you can post how your day's going?..We can talk about how much better life is without booze what new struggles we're dealing with and pull each other up when we're feeling down.  The power of community is a wonderful thing for us...As a new member I'm not sure if this has been done before but I see it being very helpful.  Sobriety is about taking things one day at a time.

We do have a few things like that.  I'll occasionally do a Modest Monday or Friendly Friday thread.  PokeyJones does a Sober Sunday thread.  We've had a few others too. I found that people tend to lose interest if we do them too often. If you want to give it a shot start up a thread tomorrow.  Just don't do one on Sunday or pokey will whoop your ass.  Sunday belongs to PokeyJones...Edit:  And don't forget that you can always drop into the [chat room](http://icanhazchat.com/?room=stopdrinking) room or [irc](http://webchat.snoonet.com) too...Edit 2:  Reddit will not format my links.  Bad reddit...Edit 3:  Frumious pointed out that I'm a dumbass.  On IRC.  I mean he pointed it out via IRC not that he pointed out that I'm a dumbass when I'm on IRC. But that's true too.
Hey! If you want to start one tomorrow (Wednesday) and then continue to do one every Wednesday that'd be great. It would be an awesome way to get involved in the subreddit. As offtherocks mentioned we have Modest Monday Pokey's Super Sober Sunday check in and NOW we have a Saturday AMA...:)
