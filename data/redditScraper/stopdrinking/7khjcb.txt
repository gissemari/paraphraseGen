With the Christmas and finals and my new job and other lovely stressful events comming I often forget to just stop for a while and look back at the SEVEN BLOODY SOBER months. So many opportunities to drink! Cravings bad mood good mood social events alone time relapsing friends thursdays.....So I would just like to remind myself that I am - so far - kicking some serious ass when it comes to not drinking! ..And whether you are on day 1 or 10000 - excellent job! I am dead serious I am so proud of you!..Sobriety starts to feel natural to me which is awesome. On the other hand it's easier to forget the battles fought to earn this feeling. So why not remind myself (and maybe you too) with a litlle post :-)..Happy holidays I won't drink with you today.

Fabulous idea great post!  Knowing I'm not alone in this makes all the difference.  ..I've made it through some holiday events so far that were a bit challenging but I find I'm doing better every time I get out and socialize.  Your post helps me and will serve as I reminder as I go forward in these holidays!..Happy festive wishes to you!
Congratulations on Your Sober Journey!
