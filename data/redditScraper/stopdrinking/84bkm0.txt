I'd had a long couple of days at work my other half isn't well and is in the process of further diagnoses that don't look good the dog's too old and tired to give me any attention I don't want to worry my kids it's dark and rainy outside. I can cope but there's no escape. Last night I could have just done with a drink to take the edge off - you know what I mean? Just a little something to cheer me up and help me unwind and relax. I just felt restless and a bit bored my mind wouldn't stop going round and round. A glass of ginger beer just didn't quite do it for me! Anyway I didn't have a drink as I'm proud of my sobriety and I know nothing good will come of drinking especially the next day (or worse the middle of the night when I'm woken up) and I know I have to focus on my other half at the moment so being drunk or hung over will not help. I just wanted to vent as I'm missing my old friend but I won't drink with any of you today or tonight!

Well done - stick with it - takes the edge off for a few hours but feel worse after !   I've realised - finally - eventually - it's easier to tackle problems sober rather than being pissed/hung over !

Moan away !!   Hopefully I'll remember to take my own advice when I'm struggling !!  Listen to the sensible voice in my head rather the shithead one ! 
I'm here for you thinking of you. You did the right thing to come here and let it out. IWNDWYT.
