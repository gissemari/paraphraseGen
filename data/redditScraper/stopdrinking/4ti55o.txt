Have been circling this wagon for many years. I am 38 and have been regularly drinking for 13 years. I have tried to quit many times and each time things get better and then I drink again and my drinking amount increases. I no longer want to be burdened headaches and low productivity. I live thinking about living rather than actually going out and doing activities. Any advice for ways not to relapse in early sobriety would be appreciated!

Don't do it alone. This sub is great for support and helping finding other support systems. Family and friends are a tremendous help and will likely be happy you're quitting. 
Welcome!  Getting sober was a huge physical change for my body to get used to.  I needed plenty of rest and good food.  Exercise helped me early too.
The things I describe at this link [to a post called the Baby Steps worked for me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Good luck and welcome aboard the SD lifeboat.
No one's said it yet? Okay I will...Dry people dry places. Many of us find that when trying to cut something out of our lives that has been consuming us for years or decades we are not immediately able to put ourselves *comfortably* in situations where alcohol flows freely...I'm not saying stay away from a Chili's at lunchtime just because they have a bar but maybe not hit that wine tour some of your friends were thinking of going on...You're going to see a lot of stories here of people that made it through encounters like the wine tour but.....just....why....test your willpower so early on? ..In my opinion early sobriety is a time to work on *you* forming new habits examining old behaviors and sometimes focusing on *just staying sober*...Good luck.
Hey there and welcome! One of the biggest helps for me so far is to *have a plan*. Have a plan for your days have a plan for your weekends coping mechanisms and things to turn to when you are feeling like picking up. I literally keep a list I can get to on my phone/computer of resources and tools in my "toolbox" that aid me in staying sober. Things like talking to my therapist my gratitude journal a hot cup of tea - many different items. Welcome and good luck! r/stopdrinking is a one of a kind community glad you're here =)
