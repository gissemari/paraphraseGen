Things are going well. So much on the go I don't have time to drink. If I do it will all fall apart overnight. Surprisingly I don't feel like drinking...that's a first as at 3 weeks i've usually convinced myself that one or two won't hurt and ruin everything. My Mom is now settled in care facility and after meeting with her team of caregivers it has sunk in that she could never live alone again. Mostly she is in a time decades ago in her mind and has n  physical mobility at all. I have her apartment almost cleared out with many items gifted to family donated or in boxes to deal with over time. There have been some tough moments. Yesterday when there with my son I suggested he take the couple of bottles of booze that were in the cupboard. He declined as the bottles were only about a third full and poured them down the drain. What a waste I thought!!! Glad he did that though. House Reno is well on its way. Twins are gearing up to move out in a month as we gave them a Sept 1st deadline. I bought a new vehicle...on a bit of a limb here but mine was going to cost a lot fairly soon and also had some bad memories for me. I took a leave from work to get all this done and keep the pressure down as I realized I need all these things in order before I can commit time my career demands. Accepted I do not have super powers  and must ask for help with all this instead of becoming overwhelmed and escaping in a bottle. My dog had surgery on Friday and is recovering well from a torn ligament. Picked him up to find we have matching casts. On my last bender I fractured my wrist. Thought it was sprained and only had xrays last week resulting in a trip to the ER cast clinic.  Constant pain has certainly been a good reminder of why I cannot drink safely...ever. very busy few weeks with much accomplished. So much better dealing with issues than trying to drink them away. Thanks to all of you here on SD for the inspiration to keep trying and never give up...no matter how many times I have relapsed in the past (trillions!).
