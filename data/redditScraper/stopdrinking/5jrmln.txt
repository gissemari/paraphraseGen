I had been suffering from some emotional instability for the last year or so and made a move 6 hours away from home to live with my sister in order to get a change of scenery and try get myself out of this "funk" I was in. Once I moved there my life become and endless cycle of drinking/partying with my sister and crying from being homesick and generally having a hard time in my life. My sister is not a very empathetic person and could not deal with my emotions and would tend to get angry and frustrated with me when I would get upset and it just led to me closing myself off even more and feeling worse.  ..Four nights ago my sister and went to my staff Christmas party and got drunk as usual. I drunkenly made a fool of myself and became upset over some guy even though sober me wouldn't have even cared. This led to my sister drunkenly telling me that I have no self esteem and no self respect things I have already been struggling with. Once I got home I just became so overwhelmed with how I'd been feeling the past year the cycle of drinking and feeling shitty then waking up and feeling even shittier. I ended up taking a whole bottle of pills and called my mom sobbing telling her what I did. I don't remember a lot of what happened after that but I woke up in ICU with a breathing tube and restrained to the bed. After throwing up all over myself a few times the nurse cleaned me up and told me that I needed to call my mom because the last thing she told my mom was that I was in ICU and I was non responsive. I have never felt so terrible in my entire life. I felt so guilty for putting my mom through that and thankfully I was actually happy to be alive. ..My sister and my dad have both responded to the incident with anger and think I was just being dramatic. I have since gone back home for a while and my sister has not spoken to me since. My dad has warmed up a bit to me but it's been tough. I know that my first step towards improving my mental health is to stop drinking. I used to be able to drink with my friends and stop when I wanted but it has become clear that the alcohol is just making me feel worse. Most of my family and friends have responded really well to my sobriety but I am worried about how my sister will respond. Most of our life since living together has included a lot of drinking. I know my sister loves me but I'm afraid she won't respond well to the sobriety and in the past has said that she doesn't think I would ever be able to not drink. I'm worried about how this is going to affect our relationship and living situation. I'm sorry about the wall of text but I just really needed to get my story out and was looking for advice on how to tell my sister about my decision to be sober.

Good job deciding to get sober!  That's awesome!...Your sister loves you although she has a rough way of showing it.  She wants you to feel better so she uses "tough love" and "just snap out of it!" talk.  It hardly ever works of course but she's coming from the right place.  She just wants what's best for her sister....Talk to her.  She'll be fine and after a while when she sees how great your sober life is maybe she'll decide to follow your good example.
