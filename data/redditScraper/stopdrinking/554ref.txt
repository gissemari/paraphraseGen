I feel like I don't have any control over this. It actually hurts and makes me want to cry that alcohol might be out of my life for good. I just want to SCREAM!

I hear you. I stopped for almost 100 days then got overconfident "forgetting" what a problem it's been for me. I started again last week at a dinner party with just two drinks that night and already back to binging and starting arguments and all the old consequences. I'm back to day one and I feel so horrible. i think I'll start to feel better when I've earned my one day badge back! Just a few more hours...
It's normal to feel sad and angry and on edge in the early days of sobriety. I did too. It felt like the end of a love affair that went bad. ..You have control over whether you take the first drink or not. I always remember why I stopped in the first place. It has helped me stay sober for a "few days"!
Alcohol is just out of my life for Today...Not for a week.  A month.  A year.  Certainly not **Forever** !!..It's just Today...Today I decided to forgo ONE drink that's all - The First One...Tomorrow......and certainly Forever will take care of themselves...All this forever nonsense is your mind lying to you!!
I never mourned that alcohol left my life. I needed to figure out a health way to occupy my mind along with keeping my body busy. It just takes time to heal.
