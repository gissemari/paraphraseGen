What are you going to do differently so it doesn't happen again?
Hey welcome back fellow relapser and congrats on coming back! It wasn't easy today but I am not drinking with you.
I relapsed as well. Been a pretty bad month.  I will not drink with you today. 
Same here!
Same here. Hope to make it through. Day one again. I need to make it stick this time. My wife is running out of patience.   And I want it too!
Hey don't beat your self over it. Nobody is perfect. Good luck!
Welcome back.  Thanks for sharing.  I've just read a bunch of relapse stories.  All the same.  16 months ago I had to face music I had to stop or cut way back.  I never had attempted to moderate before.  Well now I've had many starts and stops.  I've learned there is no moderation so I am now happy to embrace sobriety.  We are on our way!  I won't drink with you today.
Glad to have you with us :)
