A 3 week relapse has made me see what alcohol is in my life. It is nothing good ever it has never lead to anything positive.  I have a wonderful caring loving person in my life who wants me to be healthy who has put up with so much of my shit who I don't know will ever really recover from what I have put him through out of my selfishness and this disease and I'll carry that guilt with me forever. I want to fix it everything but I cant fix the past. I just I don't want to continue hurting him and myself. I want health. I said to him today I don't even mind if I never make you happy again I just want to stop making you sad. And that is the truth. I can't believe I have become this person that hurts the ones I love by hurting myself. I'm done being that person. I have a family of alcoholics who I am visiting at the moment who are toxic in my life and I fall back into this trap how predictable of me sick of that. I want to stop being weak. I don't want to be like them. I can see a better version of myself out there and I want to be that person. Alcohol stops me from that.  it's 2 mins until 24 hours no booze. I hope I can write this and look back at it in a years time and see how far I have come.

Good for you for making this decision to change your life. None of us can change our pasts. I think about my grown children always seeing me with a wine glass and a buzz....and I wish I could take that past away. I can't. All I can do is move forward and make better choices. And I won't beat myself up over my past. I just know I want better in my life. I will not drink with you today!
