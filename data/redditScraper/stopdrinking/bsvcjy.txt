After being drunk for about 16 years straight pretty much every day since I was about 19 it finally clicked booze is just stupid and just a plot against the goyim. ..I have a fucked up tooth I got taken care of and the infection pain pills and dental work masked the DT so that was really lucky timing to be able to power through that ugly part.  Don't worry doctor I just got really cold but I'll be fine I just need to put on my hoodie. ..Now I'm feeling pretty home free. Drinking seriously sucks it is literally poison and it makes you stupid and simple. Good riddance.  Wish me luck on my 2nd week I'm feeling great about it finally. ..Was so hard and such a struggle then suddenly seemed so natural and effortless once I was finally really ready to walk on my own. Booze is a weapon of mass destruction in class warfare and I'm done assisting the enemy so will not drink with you today. Feels good thanks for your help everyone. I reset this dumb badge like 30 times but this time feels so much different.

Good luck. IWNDWYT
It's liberating :D
Good luck to you on your journey but to be absolutely clear we are a support group that does not discriminate by race or religion. Alcohol is not a  plot against the goyim  as you say. I've reported that this post be removed because of that...I wish you all the best in your journey in sobriety it is the gift that keeps giving. I'm rooting for you one week is a huge accomplishment! Just take it one day at a time. I hope you keep checking in here...I will not drink with you today!
That realization is something else. Seems simple but alcohol blinds us. Huge step. "finally clicked." " Literally poison." Awesome.
I know plenty of Jewish drunks op but whatever motivates you is I guess healthy.
