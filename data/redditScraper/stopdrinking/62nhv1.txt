I am currently out of the family home after my latest relapse. I met my SO today and I thought I might be able to come home.  Life has been busy so the weeks have gone by without us talking properly. In short I can't come home for the foreseeable which is devastating but I know that there is hope.  Despite all this I am positive. She is right she needs to know that I am back in control. She needs to know that I am taking this seriously. I don't socialise much anymore as I was busy with three small kids and many of my friends are in the same boat. She told me to reconnect with friends and she is right. Ironically all my friends are in Poland on a stag weekend right now. I didn't go due to my fear of drinking!!! I am serious about quitting alcohol and I need to prove it. I need to tell so close friends about my problem which I will do but I need to find the right moment. I don't really know the whole point of this post but I just needed to share!  Thanks for listening!!  Ironically I feel that I should be drinking given the result of today instead I feel the opposite!

I have been told that it takes a full year to detox the brain and rebalance all the chemicals. Besides there is that 1 year rule. ..Just try to rebuild your relationships in a healthy way. If you have kids see them and talk to them as often as possible even if it is supervised. ..That trust is a hard thing to rebuild. It has been 3 1/2 years and my daughter still does not speak to me much but she does allow me free access to the grands and for that I am thankful. ..Perhaps that relationship will heal perhaps it won't. I do know that either way my sobriety HAS to come first. The moment I let something even a relationship with a higher power come first I run the risk of losing my sobriety. ..I cannot take that chance so I will not drink with you today!
