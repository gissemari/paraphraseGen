Four months and a day sober today after drinking daily for 3ish years. Tried to quit cigarettes too this week but no luck. My weight is back down to normal and my skin is coming along. In general I see how drinking has been good for me as I'm less explosive towards the people in my life and I've been doing a better job of making/saving money my personality has come back to me slowly and I feel a lot more comfortable with myself. I still feel very depressed but a lot less anxious. I'm struggling a lot with accepting life as it comes which is a big reason why I kept drinking after it stopped being fun. Not sure why I'm posting it's relieving that I won't be spending my birthday drunk or hungover then drunk and I'm thankful for that.
