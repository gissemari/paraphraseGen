I finally had the dreaded relapse dream last night. I was with an acquaintance that I'd only met once in my life at a bar several months ago & we hit up the liquor store & I picked up a six pack of my favorite brew & finished the whole pack. I remember feeling absolutely ashamed & disappointed in myself knowing that I couldn't even last a full week without a drink...But alas! It was just a dream & today marks my first week without alcohol. Last Thursday night I bought my last six pack & I must say it's been a very refreshing week without alcohol in my life. I couldn't have done it without the amazing people in this community my family & all those cups of chamomile tea! I look forward to the future without alcohol involved in it. Hope everyone has a wonderful day!

What else has been different?
I had a relapse dream last night too! Except mine involved missing 2 days of work due to being too drunk and then having to explain it to my boss. It's eerily similar to things that have actually happened so much so that I woke up terrified that it wasn't a dream. I'm kind of glad my subconscious finally seems to be on board with the idea that drinking + me = certain disaster!! 
Congrats! I had a drinking dream last night downing bottles of beer while carrying a bottle of whiskey (I barely ever drank whiskey lol)..The dreams will keep popping up but feeling guilt from them is a good sign. It means the deep parts of your brain know you shouldn't do it...Keep it up the longer you go the better you'll feel!! You can do it!!.
i hate relapse dreams i get so worked up i usually realize im dreaming then force wake up so i can take a breathe and be super relieved..its weirdly helpful though lol
Good on you.
