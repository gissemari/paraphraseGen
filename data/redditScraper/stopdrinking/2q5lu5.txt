Hey guys haven't posted in a while.  Just thought I'd check in.  Getting a 4.0 this semester awesome new girlfriend parents are proud of me.  Life is coming together.  Amazing what getting sober will do for you and when I look back on where I was last year I get excited for where I will be in another.  Best of luck to everybody struggling and all I can say is just hang in there.  It's all worth it.  Anyway hope you guys are doing well tonight.  If anybody needs to chat let me know

Wow good for you /u/deathbysexy!
This is awesome! Congratulations! I was beginning to worry that the sexiness had finally done you in.... ;)
Cool!
Congrats. 435 days dang. I just want to say I really like your sentence "when I look on where I was last year I get excited for where I will be in another. " what a great outlook especially for me because yes things are getting better for me in sobriety but what can I say I'm your typical impatient addict. I've been doing some reflecting on where I was last year and I'm grateful I'm. Not out of my mind with my compulsion to drink. And that's some big progress. I'm just impatient because I still feel stuck in other areas of my life. But  after another year of consistent daily actions who knows what's possible...Thanks for sharing your enthusiasm and positivity congrats and hey nice work on your 4.0!!!
CONGRATULATIONS!
435 days? Amazing! Good for you xoxo
