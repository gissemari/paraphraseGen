I woke up at 5am feeling nauseous and went back to sleep only to wake up with a full blown stomach flu. My husband took our son to the movies and my mom came by and took my daughter to church so I'm lying in bed in an empty house. Which never ever happens. I'm trying to fall asleep but I keep being overwhelmed by feelings of guilt and anxiety every few minutes. I just realized this is the first time I've been sick since not drinking and it does feel an awful lot like a bad hangover. I'm having residual guilt for all the times I've stayed in bed with a hangover while my family picked up the slack. I'm proud of myself for lying here and figuring out my feelings instead of turning on the tv to drown them out. I still feel awful but maybe now I can rest! I also feel a little nervous that my husband might think I relapsed after he went to sleep last night because this is exactly how I felt/looked when I was hungover in the past. I can't believe how often I willingly chose to make myself feel like this in the past!
