[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy Hump Day! What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** I met Sebastian years ago when I got a temporary job to replace a woman at a company who had to take a long sick leave. She was crazy in love with Sebastian and he and I became good friends while she was gone. (He's gay so it was strictly platonic.) I was still drinking at the time and he was a normie who didn't ever drink but now I'm making plans to see him for dinner and I am so happy not to be drinking! I feel like I can be a better friend to him now...**Struggle:** I am a slob. Sobriety has not changed this except that now I'm a sober slob instead of a drunken one. Half the time my tiny apartment looks like a bomb went off inside a clothing factory. And now that I am doing painted-paper collage it's even worse with pieces of cut paper everywhere. I have had to come to terms with the fact that this is probably never going to change...**General:**  How did it get so late so soon? It's night before it's afternoon. December is here before it's June. My goodness how the time has flewn. How did it get so late so soon?   Dr. Seuss ..
----------immediate responses--------

T:  I'm coming up on 666.  I remember someone at a SMART meeting who was on day 666 and I was really almost like awestruck.  There is just something about it that was tangible but yet so distant.  With a year people can make it a year on will power and white knuckles but someone with 30 years it's just they are very far removed from day one or even year one. ..S:  It's real.  Too damn real...G:  "And will you succeed?  Yes!  You will indeed!  (98 and 3/4% guaranteed.)"  That's from Oh the Places You'll Go!  by Dr. Seuss.   :)
**Triumph:**  I was thinking about rescheduling my next licensing exam.  With Thanksgiving and family visiting and my son's birthday and work I felt like I hadn't studied as much as I needed. But I've been studying for months and I knew I would never feel ready.  I just had to do it.  Worse thing that happens I'd be out $200+ and have to wait a couple of months to retake.  So I just crammed and crammed some more and showed up Monday to take it.  I *think* it went well.  I'll have to wait a couple of days to find out.  I'm glad I went for it and didn't stall...**Struggle:** I've been seeing signs of compulsion in myself that I don't like.  I just lowered my nicotine in my vape down so that might be part of it but I feel like the inner addict is looking for compulsive behaviors to latch onto. Sugar and junk food and general over eating are things I find myself doing recently even when I've decided not to.  Time to exercise more and try some meditation I suppose...**General:** Tomorrow's daylight is supposed to be 1 minute and 10 seconds less than today according to the weather site I viewed.  Hmph.  
Triumph: I'm on day 86 as of midnight. I'm doing good. This is my 4th quit attempt and everything feels perfectly fine most of the time. I'm so busy with school work writing and an improv troupe I'm in that I stay really busy and don't think about drinking much. For me being bored is a big trigger. I'm more confident in ever about staying off the drink because I've learned from my previous attempts. A favorite sober skateboarder of mine expressed that "it doesn't happen overnight." It's a process and the learning doesn't stop. Addiction is tough to figure out. Anyway I'm rambling. I'm sober happier and I have less anxiety than when I was drinking. Side note: Thursday of next week I will have my Associates degree and a Certificate of Specialization in Creative Writing. I'm fucking PSYCHED...Struggle: I quit because I got my first DWI on 9/10/17. Been sober since I woke up the day after. So I'm paying for that and even taking the spring semester off college to work and pay it off and get my finances in order before transferring to a university. This is when I'll have more time to get bored and I'm sure some tests will lie ahead for me but like I said I'm feeling really good about sobriety right now. ..General: Today you are you! That is truer than true! There is no one alive who is you-er than you! -Dr. Seuss..(^as an aspiring writer I'm always trying to remember this quote and beat it into my head how important it is to just be yourself in this life. No one can do anything the way that you can.)
After drinking last week I've gone 4 days and already I feel so much better! Motivation positivity and energy are all back just got to remember how it took all that away when I think of having just the 'one' (10) again..I wish you all a great day and....I will not drink with you today!
*Triumph:* Saint Marge has a thing for Christmas calendars so I make her one each year. It is on the exact same format every year; square cards with a contemporary pattern on the back and a theme on the front either pictures lyrics or whatever. Year one was handsome actors from movies and series we had seen saying how they appreciated different sides of her. Two years ago was traces of our then 2 y o daughter; pictures of things she had misplaced taken one bite out of and left broken etc. This year it is ransom notes you know where criminals cut out letters from the newspaper and glue to make a creepy message. The first one said "I see you" the second "I hear you" and so on - affirmative notes saying that she s always in my mind and in my senses. Well anyway they stack up. This year is season seven or eight I think. The goal is to have our kids clean up after us and find fifty plus years of calendars neatly packed in boxes. I m very happy that I had the presence to make it this year too. ..*Struggle:* As of this week I m on social security shaving my income with a third (just before Christmas sigh). I should be happy for a great social security system but these are trying times. Worst part is not knowing if I can ever work full time again...*General:* The Christmas decorations are up (we do it early to spread the hassle and prolong the *hygge*. That should add a little light to the long December nights.
T: I got a full night's sleep and today is a bank holiday (also my country's Independence day)..S: I'm seriously thinking about changing my job as it takes so much more than it gives. But I don't think I can handle that right now as I have to start hunting for a flat on January. Also searching for a therapist on top of that...G: I wonder if I should lay off climbing etc for now.. I realized today that only now do I feel recovered and my last session was a week ago which wasn't even that heavy (who am I kidding? It was 25 hours and 15 routes)
T: I have been able to give my 4 year old a standing up horsey ride on my back the last 2 days. Nice to not be afraid to do it for fear she would fall off my drunk ass...S: I haven't been feeling well. Rolling stomach with a slight headache. Not sure if I am coming down with the stomach bug as one of my children was throwing up yesterday morning or if it is from cutting all alcohol for the last 2 days...G: Christmas shopping is 95% done and wrapped. Woot! 
T: I've been keeping my apartment clean and it feels incredible. I'm starting to structure my environment and to come home each day to a clean and tidy room reinforces the control I have on my life...control that I struggled to have when I was drinking...S: Social events are still difficult for me because the people I've gotten to know over the years drink without thinking about it (so it seems). There's an event I'm going to tonight and I know the temptation for "just one" will be there but I will not succumb to it...G: I love "Flow" by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and that first track that opens up Bj rk's new album.
Triumph: I am happy that some people here said my post made a difference for them. ..Struggle: I work for myself. I am grateful to have a lot of freedom around how to allocate my time and ... I have a lot of freedom around how to allocate my time. Constantly second-guessing myself which can be exhausting. ..General: "You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose." --Dr. Seuss
T: I'm back on the wagon! All of 36 hours  but hey its a start. ..S: if this last bender hasn't gotten me fired  then I'll be very surprised/grateful. ..G: I think the only reason I have a job  is because im the only person in the company who can do it  so I've got that going in for me  which is nice.  
T: I am over a week sober for the first time in over a year. Also paired with diet and exercise I'm down 4lbs (Looking to lose 20)..S: I am home from work sick though I'm not tempted to drink (no booze in the home) I hate being alone living so close to a liquor store. .
**Triumph:**    Had a lovely time with K (SO) celebrating his 15 Year Soberversary last night - consisted of take-out Italian Polar Seltzers ice cream cake and coffee. What a cozy and fun way to celebrate such an amazing milestone! I'm extra *grateful* today for our sobriety :)...**Struggle:**    Can't believe I'm saying this but this is probably the worst thing I can report right now (how cool is that?!): a string of Christmas lights went out and I have to replace them. I'll take *that* over a damn hangover *any day*!..**General:**    Love this one from Dr. S: *"Don't cry because it's over. Smile because it happened."*
Triumph: I was out for trivia the other night and a younger lady started asking me about why I don't drink. I'm usually very guarded about these kinds of questions but I decided to put it out there that once I start I don't stop and how it caused so many problems in my life. It turns out she wasn't just being intrusive but was questioning her own drinking. We talked a bit about it between trivia questions and I hope to be able to talk to her more personally if I see her out again. It's crazy to me that apparently people notice the fact that I've quit drinking and think of me as the person to talk about it...Struggle: I think I've entered pre-menopause and my body doesn't even know what to do with itself lately. Emotions are running wild I'm breaking out despite using an acne system my brain just decides to not work at times my sleep has not been great. I'm going to see the doctor to make sure it's not anything else going on but if I've got several more years of this to deal with it's gonna suck :(..General: It's that vitamin D time of year here shorter days and it's so grey even when the sun is out. 
T: picked up my 30-day chip last night after a false start or two. Also got pulled over last night for a faulty tail light and it was SUCH a relief not to be thinking  oh shit will he smell it? Am I slurring? Are there empties in view? ...S: for the first time I'm really noticing the extent to which alcohol is embedded in entertainment (playing Fallout and I have more booze than bullets in my inventory). Gives me the itch a bit but being broke as hell helps curb that itch. :-)..G: working on the scoot today. It's too damned nice out to be caged in the car... I need to get some bugs in my teeth. ..Sober on friends!

**Triumph:** I signed the paperwork for full-time employment! I'm still uninsured for another 10 days but it's exciting to be a bit more stable!..**Struggle:** I haven't lost the weight from Thanksgiving. I need to be more strict about my eating window and my sugar intake so I'm not worried about losing it before the year's up. ..**General:** After my parents were pretty grossed out by my place when they came over for Thanksgiving I realized I need to turn my apartment into a home I can take pride in not just a place where I keep my things and sleep. I clean the kitchen (including sink and stovetop) every night before bed. Sundays are for cleaning the bathroom. Mondays are for laundry. Tuesdays are for the back room. I'm still figuring the rest out but for right now I'm excited to figure this out. 
Triumph: Worked 80 hours in 7 days. Been difficult but will be balling for Christmas. ..Struggle: The bare minimum of self care for me is not drinking. Ive only been doing the bare minimum. ..General: Been watching this superdad videos where they make beds with storage with bits from Ikea. Reckon I'll do that. Pick up some jam while I'm there. Y'all had their jam? Magic.

Not drinking with you all tonight. 
triumph: i stopped at two stores last night wanting to buy chips to binge on. i left the first store saying "if you get to the second store and still want the chips binge." when i got to the second store i said to myself "if you can leave here without chips they will not be in your apartment." i know that drive to hurt myself is the direct result of a relationship i need to stop participating in. it is hard though. tackling all the bad vices at once...struggle: i have been hard on myself lately. i am working on being a kinder more supportive voice...general: time to really better my life by removing a toxic person that does not deserve me. easier said than done but i think it is time.
**Triumph:** I've had some really great times over the past few months...**Struggle:** I'm dealing with some family issues that are forcing me to dig deep inside. MY big challenge is opening up emotionally to my friends and asking for the support they will gladly give...**General:** There are two holiday traditions I've established. One is watching The Grinch (the original. Don't even mention the new one). The other is the [Tick Christmas special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GItq3dooxhY)
I've been having the same conversation back and forth in my head pretty much the entire time since I made the decision to stop. Can i be a different type of drinker this time or stop because you know it won't change. 19 years of drinking and I feel like I'm losing a big part of my life. Friends fun etc. but I know for today I won't be drinking with all of you. 
T: I'm approaching a whole year with zero alcohol. I have had no alcohol in 2017. Wow. Now I think of this pleasing fact more than I think of drinking. ..S: Anxiety is up more than a bit. Holidays as an adult are stressful. What a waste of energy anxiety is. ..G: Reminding myself of all I have to be grateful for and making a plan to get all this Christmas stuff done. .
I found out today I need more dental work and my insurance is maxed out for the year until July! Holy shit I will not drink today.
T: Not quite there yet.  Gotta get past this upcoming weekend and then we'll talk...S: Next is coming to terms with the fact that I'm struggling with general depression.  Watched the USAToday.com video yesterday where I was able to point at all of them except the agression:  https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/health/2017/12/01/12-signs-depression-men/107398546/..G:  Hoping to start saving my "poison money" towards things I want (camera lens iPad Pro iPhone x etc.).
T: I slept for a full 8 hours last night without waking up once!  .  .S: The downside of that: I'm terrified of sleeping/not being in control of my body for a full night so without alcohol I stay up as late as possible until I'm dead tired and pass out. I've been terrified of sleeping since I was a kid. I don't have bad dreams but I hate the idea of laying there without control of my body for such a long period of time.  .  .G: I've been sober for 3 days!! I know I'll have anhedonia for long time and I've been extremely tired regardless of how much sleep I get but there's been glimpses of happiness these last couple days.  .  .IWNDWYT!
**Triumph**: Powered through a rough couple of days of work and family stuff to get my 3 week flair. 3 weeks is where I crashed and burned last time so to power through this barrier is a remarkable victory for me. Interestingly (for me at least) it was the shame associated with resetting my badge that provided the motivation to not destroy the bottles that are still in my house. It's a small thing that little number but man-alive does it mean something to me at this point. I fought hard for that little '24' and I'll be damned if I'm going to give it up for the fleeting superficial pleasure of a few drinks. Like Jerry Seinfeld and his streak of creating original content I'm inspired by the chain I've built and I am committed to not breaking it. ..**Struggle**: I think I was experiencing a bit of a pink cloud for the first 21 days or so but it seems to be wearing thin. The familiar physiological symptoms of anxiety have been manifesting lately and without my "medicine" I'm forced to just invite these feelings in for a cup of tea. I know that this is the healthy thing to do that will lead to lasting fulfilling peace and joy but I wish it wasn't such a bag of poo...**General**: Like many other people on this sub I've somehow cut 100s of calories out of my daily intake and have not shed a pound. And I'm not eating any more than usual. I suppose that a body loves homeostasis and will fight to hold on to every pound that I put on. Mind you I'm fairly slim but I was quite looking forward to seeing a 6-pack emerge as a reward for my virtuousness. 
**Triumph:** Made it to 100 days and beyond while celebrating Thanksgiving with family and friends in Hawaii.  Old me would have been drinking during the whole vacation...**Struggles:** My S.O. drank during the whole vacation and it really turned me off to her especially when she became vile and hateful during numerous blackouts.  I am struggling (and failing) to not blow up with anger at her for basically continuing to live (drink) the we always had.  But now it's so much easier for me to see how the disease is progressing and how close she is to hitting a really nasty bottom that may include divorce which really breaks my heart to think about (I so miss the sweet woman I met all those years ago)..**General:** think I'll watch Horton Hears a Who to lighten my mood..
sfgirlmary you are a hugely creative person with both the eye and the hand of an artist. Being a slob (your word) may be part of your artistic process. If everything were in neat little piles your art might not be as expressive.  
Triumph : I've worked well the past few days with some exceptions. ..Struggle : The exceptions. I've been a little undisciplined and irresponsible and lost some time with deadlines coming up. I haven't drank but I've escaped in other ways. I let the stress get to me. ..General : Had a rough couple of days but I will do my best to correct things in the next ones. 
Triumph: Finishing day 11 no cravings no more side effects. ..Struggle: I have gained weight. Somehow cutting out 1000+ calories in rum and Pepsi's daily has netted me gaining 5+ pounds. I find that fact depressing because weight loss was my shallow reason for stopping (on top of my substantive reasons)..General: Even with minimal commitments holiday season has been stressful this year. Guess I feel pressured to make it more memorable since my oldest child is 4 now.
