Dear /r/Stopdrinking.Its been a long stone cold dead day in my life. The long stares of my wife listen as I confess my deepest sins. I am a constant relapse(r). I get drunk and scream vicious bullshit in the night sky. I am about to lose my job because of my alcoholism. I have posted before but I forget the name. In many post I was read of your community and need the help to stay on the sober wagon.  I would write my story on here right now but I am just checking in with the community. Thanks for listening. .BlackMarket

Welcome to the sub! I imagine it was a crappy day if you were having to lay it all out for your wife...but truth be told she probably already knew quite a bit of it...I certainly wasn't as clever as I thought I was!..Oh well....you only have to do that once if you want! Read around get reacquainted with the folks here...and don't have that first drink!..What's your plan for staying sober?

Its possible.. Rock bottom is different for everyone.  You can do it we have all been there in one way or another..
Your plan of a counselor and AA is a positive step on your road to recovery. Don't drink one day at a time. 
Welcome to recovery. Not a moment too soon either.
Welcome  and enjoy your stay
