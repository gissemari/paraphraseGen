Day 8 in the books.  This is my second time I've gotten to day 8.  It took eight months the first time and I made it to 40ish days before I made bad choices and started drinking again...That was nearly four months ago.  Now I'm at day 8 again and it feels *great!*..But my journey hasn't been easy...My SO who has been trying to "cut back" and  "moderate" all that time has finally had a string of drunken moments that embarrassed her enough that she decided to quit completely...And I'm immensely proud of her.  She's on day 17.  So happy for her...Except the part of me that isn't.  Part of me is pissed that it seems so easy for her and so hard for me...I know that I shouldn't feel that way; that it's irrational.  My greatest struggles are completely internal so what I reveal to the world and what I experience are vastly different.  Why wouldn't it be the same for her?  For all of us? That what I *see* of her struggles aren't comparable to what I *don't* show everybody else...But I'm envious;  I *want* this to be easy for me because I don't want for alcohol to have such an influence on my life...And G-d help me in some ways I want it to be *harder* for her... So maybe she has a better understanding of what I've been going through.  I mean I don't *really* want that but why can't I have it as easy as she?..I *am* happy for her.  For us.  I look forward to the time when our present struggles are a distant memory; to a time when we're both in a good place and this mess we created for ourselves doesn't permeate our daily lives.. .I don't *want* to be upset. I don't *want* to be envious...And yet... Here I am...I will not let that envy take hold. I won't let it become a wedge between us.  I won't use it as an excuse to get mad at the universe then punish myself for it by drinking.  I won't ever point out that it's harder for me than her; she's smart has seen me struggle and she knows.  And has been nothing but supportive to me....In an odd turn... It's helping me realize how *lucky* I am.  Yes I'm struggling.  And yes it's seemingly harder for me than for her....But that just shows that it may be even harder for *other* people.  And *THIS* is why I come here today...Because I've read some harsh "Rock Bottom" stories here... So much worse than what I've experienced...I've seen some crazy relapse posts here... People who had years of sobriety then made a mistake... And then were deep in the clutches of alcohol for a *long* time before they came back...I've seen the stories of prison AA meetings...And I am *so very thankful* for each of those stories....Because it helps me realize that I'm a lucky man.  I have it *so easy*; so very very easy...I will *not *look at people who *seem to* be having an easier time and think "why is it so easy for them?"  And I won't look at someone who's having a harder time and say "why is it so hard for them?..Instead I understand that we all struggle in our way.  And we all may have triumphs both big and small that should be met with praise.  And many of us may have setbacks both big and small that should be met with compassion...I will not give in to irrational thoughts; I will not let emotion rule me; I will not give that strength to the enemy.  I will not let differences divide me from my fellow man...And I will not drink with you today.

Nice post - great self awareness. I have had numerous people say to me that since it was so easy for me to quit I probably didn't really have a problem in the first place. When I say  no thanks  when offered a drink they somehow think I am saying no because I don't want one. They could not be more wrong. There have been internal struggles of epic porportions. There have been days of obsessing about a glass of wine.  I guess allI am saying is things are not always as they seem and each journey is unique. Sending you strenght. IWNDWYT (no matter how diffucult that may be).
I  understand in that my husband has quit for weeks at a time with me and never ever has struggled to just say no and makes it look sooooo easy.  He wont understand how hard it is for me because he doesnt have the same brain that wants to binge drink like I do. .. Maybe your girlfriend is also having the mindset that shes not "losing" something but gaining so much by quitting drinking and she is also still in the early days so it may still be easy for her after having embarassed herself.  I have also done this where I made it look like I wasnt wanting a drink.   Give it some time there is bound to be times its a struggle for her to say no to a drink too its still early days.
