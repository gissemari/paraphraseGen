Yay! I did it...I was pretty scared about how the whole thing would go as it was during 2 consecutive days but I somehow managed. The party was a bit weird but I still managed to shake a leg on some deadly house beats. My trick was also to find people who weren't completely hammered it was then easier to get into nicer conversations than what you could expect at 3am next to a bonfire...I wouldn't say it was easy to overcome the social weirdness of not drinking and explaining why but I survived and on Sunday morning I was fit with only 4.5 hours of sleep so there's that...I had relapses over the last couple of month coupled with parties and drugs but now I have enough. I don't need nor want this hell. IWDWYT

That is a major accomplishment! Congrats!!!  IWNDWYT!
Congrats! I'm going to a wedding/vacation in 3 weeks and I'm worried about the same. But I want to shake the urge off like you did! 
 I don't need or want this hell .  Yeah!  That's the right kind of attitude   I'm happy to be here not drinking with you.  
Your experience will be the inspiration for my own sober wedding this weekend. Thank you!
