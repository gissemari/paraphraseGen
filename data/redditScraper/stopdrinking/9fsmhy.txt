Well things starting going well so I thought I'd allow myself to have a few beers here and there. Naturally a few turned into a lot. ..I work an IT job for an extremely difficult client that basically threatens to have me fired a couple times a month. It's getting to the point where the stress is not worth the money and it's making me want to go wild when I'm not at work. I'll have to move in order to get another job in my field as it's only seasonal where I'm at now. Probably not the worst thing. I've picked up some side jobs doing sound for bands in town and I truly enjoy it. I realize I'll probably have to step away from this because the temptation is too great. The main guy in the band doesn't drink and I sent him a text last night after the show saying that I struggle with alcohol but it's refreshing to be around someone who's doing well without. While I was drunk. I'm kind of embarrassed about that. ..I guess I have things going for me but this addiction makes me feel like I have absolutely nothing at all and makes me look like a fool. I want control of my life. Hopefully one day I'll get there.

Seek help and support. There are many free recovery groups you can go to. I am in AA and it has been a life saver. ..In the AA blue book one chapters discusses being around situations with alcohol. When you get sober the goal is for you to be able to be in those situations without giving in. The longer you stay sober the easier it gets. The first couple months are hard.
