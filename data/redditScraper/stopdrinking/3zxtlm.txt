but the allure of a relapse was suddenly on my mind on the drive home tonight. I wont describe the thought process because it was pretty alluring! (but you all can probably understand anyway!). One can never be too complacent can one?..EDDIT: (get it? reddit edit = eddit??huh huh? Cough anyway i stayed strong and sucessfully resisted)

Good job. One good way to dissuade yourself that I've found when tempted is to think through the whole thing what would happen to myself and my life if I picked up again to my immediate future the following day and beyond.
Well-done /u/Joseph1933 --thanks for sharing this pal.
Hi /u/Joseph1933 - I'm around the similar two-month mark as you and also have been having slip/relapse thoughts appear in my mind recently (like post-NYE recent).   ..I've found that these seemly random intrusive thoughts are actually knee-jerk responses to different stresses I encounter in the moment.  *Did my boss just have a 15 minute conversation at me about optimizing an area of use that he NEVER uses? Do I feel that I have so much to do I don't know where to start? Did I forget to eat enough before heading home?*   ..All these things happened today and while my brain first thought "Yes let's drown this in wine" I was able to trace each knee-jerk reaction back to the stressor. While it doesn't fix the stressor it immensely help me putting cravings into perspective.   .edited for format
Drink can pop in our minds at any strange random moment it's scary really my last craving my head was inside a fridge freezer!
