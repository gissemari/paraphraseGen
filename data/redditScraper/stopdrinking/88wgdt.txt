The title says it all. All the shame and embarrassment is slamming into me pretty hard at this point not to mention the horrendous hangover. I think I'm finally ready to take the next step of attending AA meetings for support but I wanted to reach out to the community for any advice on moving forward. I feel like all my hard work was wiped out in one night and I'm beyond angry with myself.

Im exactly the same... i screwed up my sobriety on day 30 yesterday... im mad at myself. Went to AA tonight and someone told me to stop beating myself up for it... just keep going. Im back to day 1 :( but it felt great to be with such positive people tonight.
Well the drinking definitely is helping you feel pretty lousy about yourself. Eat a good meal drink plenty of water and hopefully when the physical suffering subsides you'll be able to handle the mental a little more easily...Feeling guilty when you've let yourself and others down is natural and you can embrace that to help you take the next steps. Don't let it make you hate yourself and provoke reckless decisions.
I relapsed after a few years; it was kind of an experiment that failed. I realize now that I'm able to live sober and was at my best sober. Keep fighting! It get easier and you can manage it..
AA worked for me.  There are other programs but AA seems to be everywhere and free.  That being said it really is just a bunch of alcoholics trying to help each other stay sober. I sugg st tryouts ng to find some women's meetings and give it a chance.  ..I am glad you are back here. 
Ah 2 steps forward 1 step backwards.  Don't kick yourself to hard.  It took us years and years to become the alcoholics we have become I guess it would be crazy to think we will be fixed in a few days.  I do love AA though I hope you give it a serious chance you might make some life long friends if you stick around.
Don't beat yourself up and take care of your body. Drink some water and eat something. .If you want to hit an AA meeting I'd say the sooner the better before you start to spiral in your own thoughts. AA worked for me and a few tips that I've found helpful are finding meetings specific to my gender (women's meeting or men's) and remembering that if I don't like the meeting or the people I can just go to a different one. Each one is different and there are plenty of different styles. Don't be afraid to reach out to the people there. They're there to be of service. ..I wish you the best don't give up.
@ OP: Hi. Let yourself up. You're human. Means you're one of us. And just in case anyone's not yet seen it [here's the reason we're all here](http://news.medicine.iu.edu/releases/2014/05/genes-predict-alcoholism.shtml) I'll bet over 98% of alkys have this genetic panel. It's an open secret among certain western societies that this runs in bloodlines and this proves it...OP self-recrimination is [bootless](https://www.google.com/search?q=bootless+definition&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b-1) and will only slow you down. You've had the necessary education on the lying lover that booze is..."just one it'll be alright..." you can regard this most recent incident as part of the cost of your education. Which is really what it is...So get yourself to meetings daily depending on your schedule. Everyone's circumstances support group assets etc are different. All you need is a determination that booze is out of your life...Also one really helpful self-help book. Oh don't get me wrong I  despise most of the genre. I find them all to be the long form of "first get really really *lucky*...or alternately "First pull yourself up by the hair"...This one's different. If you can honestly answer on a scale of one to five a series of self-evaluation questions honestly and apply the results correctly you can change your world in an evening No BS. It happened to me. By the time I had finished the first chapter of [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-New-Mood-Therapy/dp/0380810336) ~50 pp. I felt *lighter* like in the cliche. It was weird but true. Dr. Burns gives you the tools to stop self-destructive thought patterns...and by extension self-destructive actions. It's really quite remarkable...So take a deep breath forgive yourself a mistake and make a new plan. It's not how many times you fall. It's how many times you get up determined to do better...IWNDWYT.
