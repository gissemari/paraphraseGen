Hello all I hope everyone is having a good day so far! ..I was hoping to just share some feelings that I've been dealing with since deciding to stop drinking. ..I've always struggled with depression and anxiety but since I quit drinking the feelings seem to be much more intense. I recently developed some health issues and after becoming extremely ill I was unable to drink. The thought of alcohol is enough to make my stomach flip now. I used to be a heavy drinker... I could take care of a 6 pack of beer and then at least half a 750 ml of whatever hard booze that was lying around by myself. I was drinking so much on a daily basis that it was concerning my friends. I was able to hide it from my family for the most part because I was out every single night getting plastered and not coming home until the wee hours of the morning when no one was awake. I didn't really care that people were concerned. I acknowledged that I had a problem I just did not care AT ALL. ..I'm 22 right now and I've been using alcohol as a band-aid/coping mechanism for all of life's problems since I was about 18. Seriously I was drinking about the slightest inconveniences whenever I could. I drank at jobs I drank before and after work I drank myself into oblivion on weekends. I was in a really bad way. The sad part is that I was hardly dealing with hangovers unless I was drinking terribly cheap alcohol. ..It's not like I'm really battling cravings at this point since even the smallest amount of alcohol will make me sick to my stomach now. More than anything I feel like I'm having to relearn how to deal with all of my emotions and it's kicking my butt. ..I will cry over the smallest thing or become infuriated and I hate it. It's like the part of my brain that regulates emotions is all out of wack because there's nothing to dull the feelings anymore. I know that alcohol is a depressant and that quitting is supposed to be good for depressed people but jeez... I feel like I'm just as depressed and in some ways even more so than when I was at the height of my drinking. I don't ever want to start drinking again I just want to feel normal again. ..I appreciate anyone even reading this greatly. Thanks for letting me share.

Early recovery is an emotional roller coaster. Your brain is trying to find balance again after years of alcohol abuse. Depression anxiety irritability (even mania) are very common experiences in early recovery. As your brain chemistry returns to homeostasis your mood will stabilize you will become more calm and feel much better overall. It takes time and patience. I have used meditation exercise (yoga) therapy and meetings as tools to help my brain move forward in the healing process.    .    .Try to view these uncomfortable emotional states as a good sign that your addiction dying and your brain healing. Hang in there.    .    .iwndwyt
Hang in there friend full fledged sobriety (lol whatever that is that is to say how can we accurately measure let's just say it's an evolution and you'll know it when it comes) is not the same as early sobriety.  It's BETTER.  The twitchy things become calm the ideas roll the zest is there and available the totality of gradually improving actions and behaviours are adding up and reaping their awesome results in our daily lives the energy flows in better spaces within us and around us we *see* life from a different perspective that has accumulated over this time between quitting and now.  I had immense faith in the beginning and trust and was willing to ride it out.  There are all kinds of reasons why we are up and down at first and we all experience them it's ok and if we know sooner or later it'll end then that makes it easier.  I liked to read stories success stories inspirational stories musings and reflections on here from people who were looking back and glad they kicked this thing.  Saturday Shares and Sunday Solutions in SD community info is rich in inspiration and motivation.  Best wishes you're not alone we've all been through it and so many of us have made it past the slog the in-between time.  It's good out here let's just find ways to make it easier on ourselves and pretty soon we find those things are breathing good life into us.  And we come to find ourselves breathing good life out into our personal worlds.
