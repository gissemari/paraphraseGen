Yet again resetting my badge. It's easier this time because my roommate isn't drinking and I'm also starting welding school soon!! I have my life goals set finally and I can say no more firmly. I'm not sure if that's because I have school to think about and I have to finish and do well..I am sick of where I am in my  career  and I desperately need a change. ..I've been reading a few books about others getting sober and it's really good for me to hear that some people have relapsed a few times. My brother passed on 1/28/15 from a drunk driving accident and I just can't imagine that happening to anyone else I love again including myself. Here's to a healthy time in school and doing the best I can for myself. ..I have been coming straight home from work and leaving my money at home so I don't have an option to go out and drink. I feel great every day I wake up clear headed and not hungover. Also a major date is coming up!! February 9th is my one year of quitting smoking cigarettes and my one year of lifting weights and bettering my health!!! Cannot wait to celebrate with some delicious food and my parents. ..Have a great day everyone!!

Hey good for you!  I find focusing on goals to be really a useful tool.  And I like to keep a full toolbox.  Great job on nearly a year of quitting smokes.  Cigarettes were hardest for me to quit.  You'll get there.  Sometimes it takes [practice](https://i.imgur.com/CUJF3lK.jpg)...IWNDWYT
Also my reset is for 1/28/18! So about 5 days 
I remember the conventional wisdom when I was skateboarding: everyone wrecks. Winners get back on the board. I will not drink with you today!
