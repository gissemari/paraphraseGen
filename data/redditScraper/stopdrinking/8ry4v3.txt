So I relapsed. Again. ..I'll reset my badge this evening (assuming I make it through the day)...I'm about to head out to the docs and FINALLY speak to someone about my anxiety issues and depression. I'm not anticipating much to be resolved as I am just visiting my GP I'm just glad to finally addressing the situation. I'm hoping that this will lead to a follow-up session (probably the first of many) and finally this problem that has been with me for decades will finally get talked about...What worries me is that there's an off-licence just around the corner that I have to walk past and the temptation will be very strong to call in there. I'm really hoping I can resist it.

Good for you for talking to your docs about this. Help us around the corner. There isn't a quick fix but I think you will a lot of relief and empowerment just from talking about it. Iwndwyt.
