I officially made it to three weeks. I am happy with that achievement  and the wife says my color is better than during my recent 16 month relapse DESPITE being sick as heck for over half my three sober weeks...My new band has its first long gig this week (only experience previous was three songs at a festival) and next week I see the inlaws for a pre-Christmas dinner...I hope neither event results in someone getting me a beer that I do not want. My top excuse now planned is "the doctor has me on these pills that make me sick and mess up my blood pressure if I drink when I am on them."..If someone buys the band a round it will get awkward fast as two of four are nondrinkers...I am tempted daily to just pick up a six pack and show myself I learned my lesson and I am now in control but I have resisted so far as I know I have no capacity to moderate. But the upcoming events take away some of the control.

Congrats on the 3 weeka man!
One strange thing I've noticed. As soon as you quit something harmful people (you may not have been in touch with) crawl out of nowhere offering you that shit for free.
