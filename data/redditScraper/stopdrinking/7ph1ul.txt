After six months of lurking in this sub reddit I decided it's finally time that I gain a badge and start sharing my story.  I'm currently at 350 days and will hit my 1 year mark January 25th!..I've never been one to share in AA meetings so I'm hoping I can use this outlet to express my struggles and what I've found to work best for me.  I look forward to being an active member and really giving this sub a lot of focus after I finish my first sober trip around the sun!..Thanks in advance everyone I'm excited to close my first year out and IWNDWYT!
