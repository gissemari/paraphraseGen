Just checking in to celebrate my first month sobriety after several up and downs. I was sober for nearly 500 days starting in November 2012. I relapsed in early 2014 and went on the sober path again on November 2014. I relapsed again mid of this year and here I am again sober and happy. ..What am I trying to do different this time? I'm trying to tackle the reasons why I'm drinking: Boredom anxiety no friends and no hobbies. ..* I'm planing activities for every weekend till I'm getting used to the new lifestyle  .* I'm speaking way more to my colleagues and starting to find friends I really like to hang out with not only when I'm drunk! (this will be hard). .* Finding new hobbies or re-activating old ones (video games hiking biking).  .* I'm currently listening Allen Carr's audiobook. He is mentioning some really good points and it's giving me strength!...Anyhow today evening there will be a big challenge but I'm confident that I'll survive it. I already have an exit plan so I can go whenever I want. ..Happy holidays everyone and stay sober!
