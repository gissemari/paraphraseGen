I stayed sober for longer than I have in many years. Nearly 3 weeks. I'm not proud that I caved and drank Friday then again yesterday to quell the hangover. However I am sober now and I want to try again. ..Reasons I probably caved. .1- Too early in sobriety to be hanging around people drinking for drinking's sake.2- Didn't pause to consider HALT(hungry angry lonely or tired) - this has helped me avoid relapse a number of times but this time I just let my current state dictate my behavior instead of stepping back for a second to reconsider...Without a doubt I was happier every time I chose to be sober instead of having a drink. Restless maybe but that feeling passes and staying clear headed is always worth it.

Welcome back. It's important to figure out the cause of relapse and you have. The "H" in HALT causes me the most intense cravings out of just about anything. It's great having such tools to use at our disposal. 
Back on that horse.I will not drink with you today.
Glad you're here!..After your research did you arrive at any new techniques to prevent in the future?  Willing to share with others?
