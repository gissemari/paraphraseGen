Last time I hit 6 months I threw it away in less than a week thinking that I could trust myself for a beer or two. Yeah that didn't work at all - after those beers I quickly and easily talked myself into getting hammered without really thinking twice about it.  Luckily I caught myself and the dumb little screw up didn't turn into a full blown relapse. ..So thankfully I learned my lesson last time and now that I'm back here again at 180 I'm just going to keep on keeping on. Might go out for some ice cream to celebrate.  ..Kudos to all you who didn't drink today. And for anyone who did kudos for coming back here. Onward and upward!.

Congrats! Now you have a year sober in two parts! Ice cream sounds perfect. :)
Well done on 181 days - that's superb. It all changed for me when I stopped 'trying' to quit drinking and instead just quit. Enjoy your ice-cream - it's a sticky 95 F where I am now so I might join you :) 
Good deal these 6 month mile posts.  You are well on your way now.  
Thanks for your post. You are fortunate to make it back; many do not. Yahoo! for six months...I hope to hear good news from you as time goes on.
