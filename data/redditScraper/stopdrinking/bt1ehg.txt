This is just on a lighter note and an idea I'd wanted to share. ..I didn't recognize my own issue with drinking all at once in some dramatic event. My realization was an aggregate of many little experiences but along the way there were little things that seemed to be trying to get my attention. ..Sitcoms always joke about drinking too much - usually in a way that kind of celebrates it but occasionally taking a warning tone. This gag stuck in my mind after I saw it and felt like it was speaking to me:..&amp;#x200B;..The Drew Carey Show: \[Setup\]..&amp;#x200B;..(Drew and Oswald are standing in a lab and Drew is holding an "Epiphany Ball" that gives the bearer clear insight into any question. He has a sudden Eureka moment:)..&amp;#x200B;..Drew: "Hey! Here I've been banging my head against the wall to get ahead in life and the answer is so simple!"..Oswald: (Grabbing the ball) "I want to get ahead too gimme!"..(The ball falls to the floor and smashes)..Drew: "Now what was I going to say...? Something about stopping...drinking... Oh! We should stop and get a drink on the way home."..&amp;#x200B;..\[End\]..&amp;#x200B;..So there you go. A throwaway gag on a particularly bad episode of an old show but it got me good. I had been struggling to get back on my feet at the time I watched it and lamenting my ongoing bad luck and lack of success. I hadn't had my turn with the epiphany ball yet. ..Do you have any examples from TV and movies where it felt like the characters were calling you out?
