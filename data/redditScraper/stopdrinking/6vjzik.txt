Glad you are here - don't beat yourself up - for however long you weren't drinking you were practicing sobriety. Wishing you success on your sober journey. I will not drink with you today.
Keep coming back. 
Your username says it for you. I won't drink with you today if that's what you choose.
Hey- I've done that - more than once I am afraid.  The only thing to do is just get back on the horse and keep riding.  You wouldn't quit on a diet just because you jumped ship and ate a whole bunch.  Winners are the people who just keep going ahead.  Don't let anyone judge you.  Only you know what is in your heart.
