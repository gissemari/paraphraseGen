So I've been struggling and yesterday was particularly bad. My boss knows about my issues but I can't overcome this crippling guilt that is keeping me sick so I reached out to a local inpatient program that directly addresses the guilt of addiction and only works with women. ..I don't know how I'm going to get a month off in my line of work im relied upon heavily and I don't know if I can find a temp but I need to take care of myself. ..Iwdwyt.

If you are stateside the FMLA should protect you.   ...[https://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/](https://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/)..  .Also if your employer offers an Employee Assistance Program if I were you I would take advantage of it sooner than later that can also protect you.

Your health is more important than your job. I too strongly recommend that you look into FMLA if that's an option for you. ..You're not alone.
