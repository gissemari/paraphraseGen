This is no joke guys. I'm really struggling to stay sober. The vacation is great but the things that I rely on at home to help ease stress are not available here. We are currently in the mountains in the rainforest and I just had to kill a massive spider inside my cabin. Giant insects are my phobia and this is sending me over the edge.  ..Send help! Send an exterminator and a brown paper bag please. I'm hyperventilating! ..G ..

Hang in there!
Just think if you were not sober then that damn spider would have probably crawled in your ear while you were passed out. Sobriety means being alert and enables your spider killing skills!!
You can do this! IWNDWYT!
