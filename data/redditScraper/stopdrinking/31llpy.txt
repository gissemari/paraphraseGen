I fell hard for 2 weeks. I fell so fucking hard that I nearly had my wife divorce me. Lots and lots of talking things through and I'm making this post to remind myself that april 6th I will jump back on to sobriety with you all as my witness. That relapse really destroyed me and those around me I am so sorry to myself and everyone that cares about me for this happening. But I want to regain that strength I had to make it nearly 3 weeks and make it longer. A month. Half a year fuck.. a YEAR or permanently. I am sick this is out of hand. The damage I've done because of this.. I'm at a loss for words. I have to get back on the razor's edge. I'm scared I'm anxious I'm terrified but I'm certain that this cannot happen again or I will truly be a lost pathetic cause. I pledge to not drink on monday april 6th.

I'm scared I'm anxious I'm terrified..Sounds like you are in the right state of mind to make a positive change and have it stick. Pain was required for me to make the decision to change as well.
Do you need to go to rehab?
Pick yourself up and do something different. You can do it. It takes time to recover and sometimes we relapse. That isn't an excuse it is just the way it is for many of us. It was the case for me...What are you going to do differently this time? No offense meant but it takes more than strength to get sober...
I was in a similar bad way last December 24th you can do it man!! ONE DAY AT A TIME
