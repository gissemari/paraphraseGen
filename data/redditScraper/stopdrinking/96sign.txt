I do sometimes.  Especially when it would be convenient/relaxing/easy to go back to the way things were before.  I need to remind myself why I started down this road and why I can't go back.  Sorry for doing it publicly - I need accountability right now.  I almost made a throwaway because I actually am ashamed...I'm six months out from the Incident that got me scared enough to start trying again after a months'-long relapse.   I don't remember much about that night - I remember lots and lots of crying hysteria and then that horrible teleportation to my bed waking up at 2 AM and trying to figure out what happened.  The next two days can't have been good but after a while hangovers really do run together.  But that night was bad enough...It wasn't just that night though.  The real problem started the first time I decided to drink when I was the only adult home with my young children.  I cooked for them fed them bathed them (my God) read them stories and put them to bed while so drunk I couldn't remember doing any of that...Other days - and I don't know that this is much better - I'd wait until they were down (literally counting down the minutes until 8 o'clock) before seeing how fast I could get a cup of vodka inside of me.  (Jello.  Jello is easiest because you can swallow it in huge chunks with water - I'd make it at 10 AM and look at it happily all day.)  Then I'd take it slow and see where the drop-off point for the night was - 7 or 8 drinks in all usually.  Not 9.  I never had a 9+ night that ended well...I never drove drunk thankfully.  I did drive hungover... which if I'm honest means that I drove with more of a miserable buzz on than I should have...All this to say... I *needed* to quit when I did.  Not just for my family but for myself too.  My blood pressure is naturally high - when I was drinking heavily it was very high.  I was severely overweight; now I'm only ten pounds from my target weight.  I've always struggled with my mental health - I still do - but now it's less "I'm literally drowning and can't do anything about it" and more "This is uncomfortable - how can I work on it?"  I'm better when I'm sober and it's not a subtle difference...The reason I'm second-guessing my own commitment right now - despite everything - is because I have to tell my husband the full truth.  Not just a firm "I've decided not to drink anymore" but *why*.  Including all the times I endangered our children.  I think I have to be honest if he's going to take me seriously...Even though he's seen me fail to set a limit for myself (again and again) I don't think he really understands.  He drinks most days but almost never passes two drinks.  I've only seen him hungover once or twice in the ten years we've been together - unless I was making an effort that was me almost every weekend.  He's not an alcoholic; I am...I really need to tell him.  And I'm afraid... I think mostly because once I put that out there slipping back quietly into old habits isn't going to be an option.  He *will* call me out on it (as he should).  I should have done this a long time ago...Sigh.  Thanks for listening.  IWNDWYT.
