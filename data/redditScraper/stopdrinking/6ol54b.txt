So this will be my second longest sober run ever and the last one I had I was counting every day which really seemed to help. This time however it's odd. I'm hopeful it's a good sign though because it seems to indicate that I'm so busy and occupied with my life that I don't need to count the days because I have other things to think about instead of fantasizing about alcohol and using "my number" as reinforcement for why I shouldn't drink...Just wanted to share. Relapse has been a big part of recovery for me it's interesting to see what changes each time you give it another shot. Hopefully this will be the golden-attempt in which I will have given up alcohol forever and y'no it's not scary to use the word forever this time around. Actually it's exciting...
