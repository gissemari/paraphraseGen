I'm coming up on 5 months sober and it's involved (understandably) lots of highs and lows along the way. I'm attending AA working steps seeing a therapist taking supplements exercising praying and meditating. Of course I'm not doing any of these things perfectly and am looking at ways I can do these things better. The past two weeks or so have been a huge low probably the worst since I've gotten sober. I'm reading about post-acute withdrawal and wondering if a lot of this is related to long-term healing. That or maybe I'm really depressed underneath all the previous self medicating. But I don't want to take antidepressants except as a last resort. This week I've had very brief thoughts of suicide or harming my SO with whom I had a big "why don't you do this or that in our marriage" kind of fight. Ugh. I've been low in energy just feeling overall like shit on a stick. I've thought about relapsing but thank goodness I finally understand in my core that I can't go back to alcohol. I have to forge a new way through this mess. I know a lot of this junk is for my therapist but I want to give you a snapshot and get feedback on your experiences with PAWS and/or depression.

I still struggle with depression. It comes and go's. One of the bigger things I learned getting sober was that my urges would pass if I just gave them time. Depression is the same for me at least. I can be especially low during relationship struggles. Diet and exercise play a huge role for me not only in relieving it but preventing it. Sometimes I just need a break--I start to feel burned out. So I'll plan something I know I'll enjoy like a new restaurant and new experience or a small day/weekend trip.
I found my depression lifting at around 5 months but I don't think I was clinically depressed just depressed due to alcohol and not dealing with my shit.  Sounds like you're dealing with your shit so it might be a time to see a doctor.  I have gone the Rx route twice as a short-term tool to manage my depression; at some point it becomes bio-chemical and I needed something to shift that chemical stew along with all the other things I was doing like you are (food exercise etc).
