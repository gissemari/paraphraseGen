See question in title. I'm just so discouraged. Even when I succeed in not drinking my brain just struggles so hard every day to be positive and strong even though I have so many blessings. Just feeling sad today.

You don't need to be as strong as everyone else  just be strong enough for you.  One of the hard lessons I learned was to try to not compare myself to how I perceived others to be doing in sobriety.  I found that this process takes time  and it will happen in its own time.  And trust me  not everyone is doing as well as you may think. We all struggle each day in our own way.   For some  the struggles can be overwhelming  for others it may be just a little bit. ..Be kind to yourself.  Making any changes particularly with alcohol is daunting.  There are good days and bad days.  Unfortunately  I trained myself to want things to happen immediately.  They don't. I learned patience and acceptance that I am healing  and each day I am further away from the hell I lived for over 20years. ..Take care of yourself. You are doing great. 
Sometimes but I also think most people do.  There are also times where I know the struggle is making me stronger.  I'm sure it is making you stronger too.   I'm sorry you are feeling sad. IWNDWYT.
Yes. Been feeling this way all morning. Sick of how hard it is to function everyday. Hang in there. IWNDWYT
