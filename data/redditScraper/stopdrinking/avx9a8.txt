In one fortnight it'll be my 25th birthday and roughly my 6 month birthday since quitting alcohol. The last time I posted I was about a month in and pretty furious with my life as it stood since then I've achieved more and overcome obstacles that would've flattened me if i was loaded or hungover. Work is consistent and enjoyable and manageable. And I'm close to pitching a graphic novel that I've written and illustrated myself to various publishers (exactly where I want to be in life.) this isn't to brag but know I wouldn't have had the consistent mindset to put my ideas in order on an A4 page no matter how good I thought they were rattling in my head...No one told me about the sugar thing at meetings so I got a bit fatter than I already was haha but I'm back to playing basketball and hitting weights hopefully I can be as obsessed with exercise and healthy living as I am with my career. I'm steadily talking long distance with someone and I haven't fucked it up like a sloppy idiot. whether it's friends or more I'm still learning how to properly appreciate a non sexual bond. The brain still goes for the self destruct when it wants but without a drunk motherfucker at the helm i can ride the impulse out. ..That said I did fall off at Christmas Eve however that night led to a fortnight of neuropathy type symptoms and was a reminder of why this is so important. I love being sober and in control even when explosive It's all part of the tapestry my friends. ..I hope this helps anyone struggling. Really looking to be a more active part of this sub. It's been the longest and best 6 months of my life so far and every entry I've read here has contributed...Peace. I always type too much
