Sometimes I just have no idea how I can possibly do it. Without alcohol to cope I spend 75% of the day crying. I logically know how horribly unproductive my "coping mechanism" is but sometimes it feels impossible to live with my life without SOMETHING even something as destructive and artificial as alcohol is to make me feel better even when I know it's for a short time...I know this rationalization is a horrible trap that so many people fall into. I'm trying so hard to accept that there are things outside of my control that make life really sad and difficult and I'm not helping myself by constantly trying to escape it. It's just hard...I'm just struggling. Clearly not just with alcohol but dealing with a very unhappy life which I'm sure to many people can relate to. Changing my habits in all of this feels like hopeless uphill battle sometimes. I'm doing my best...Thanks everyone and IWNDWYT

I m sorry you re struggling now. If it s any comfort many of us do and for me working through all the bad stuff in my life was something I just had to do. It was terrible and I m not done. I never realized how many issues I had pent up and postponed through my drinking but as I stopped I was able to begin that long and hard journey...It s not hopeless. It just seems that way but it s truly not. Thank you for reaching out. I will not drink with you today!
