Good morning SD! Just needed to send another thanks to this group for getting me to this point. This weekend I buried my father in law who just passed away made it through a Dropkick Murphys show in Boston for St Patrick's Day weekend and stayed sober on St Patrick's Day. Losing my father in law and burying him this weekend was definitely a huge struggle but strangely enough the fact that it was St Patrick's day was an equally challenging circumstance. (I've grown up in and lived in Boston my entire life 31 years 6 of those years I lived on the infamous parade router so you can imagine how big of a part of my life this weekend used to be.) I stayed sober all weekend as hard as it was and I thank this group for getting me to this point. Almost 4 months down. ..I will not drink with you today!
