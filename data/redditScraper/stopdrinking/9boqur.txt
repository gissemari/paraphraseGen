I promised myself to post instead of drinking so here i am. I thought about drinking the minute i got off work actually lots throughout the day. Maybe you did too? I hate alcohol for having this hold on me. Like damn. I have enough problems in life that I'm trying to sort out can this monkey pls get off my back? ..A long boozy weekend is coming up. I'm motivated to not drink finally after days recently of slipping and drinking. Relapse. Cause I'm an addict. Ugh. The only thing that helps me is knowing that nothing that feels bad right now will be helped by alcohol. Alcohol makes every problem i have ever had WORST. And not drinking specifically NOT drinking even one drink makes things better. Even when they feel shit like they do at times and even when I'm stressed and having issues breathing and freaking out. ..Soooo ok yeah. I watched these videos yesterday on YouTube which were super helpful: ..https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3UwzbMCg394 ..https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=beYVlVQxtxU&amp;t=3s..https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HPLJuyULAZ8..https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XnU2FGG8dYU..I hope they help someone else!  I will not drink with you all today I'm trying really hard not to. I forgot how much fun i had buying other kinds of random beverages. So i guess it's time to go buy craft sodas and sparkling waters! ..Also just my experience - non alcoholic beer is a NO for me. Noooope. Mess around with enough of those and it'll have me polishing off a 6 pack in no time. Glad i tried it. Def tastes like the real deal. Which did not taste amazing only tastes like getting effed up and that's what it made me want to do. ..Ok I'm done rambling. Hope you all are having an alright day and hope things get better for you if it's not.

Thank you!  I'll check these out.
Awesome stuff. Thanks :) 
I thought the near beers tasted like crap. I suppose then that I drank the real beers or hard stuff for the buzz.... no buzz no like!.Switched to sparkling waters for a later afternoon treat. Other than than tea coffee or just plain water.  It works. I watched an interesting video on alcohol addiction on Ted talk you tube the other day.
