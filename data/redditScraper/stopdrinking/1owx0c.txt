I'm 24 and I live alone. I never really drank during the week but my usual routine was to buy a bottle of scotch or whiskey on Friday night after work drink about half to 3/4 of it while watching TV and playing video games. Then I'd wake up in the afternoon on Saturday too depressed and anxious to leave the bed so I'd just order food and browse the internet until the early evening when I'd polish off the bottle. Sunday to Thursday would just be a blur of anxiety and depression that I'd slowly recover from until Friday when I'd feel good and want to drink again. ..Recently I started seeing a counselor and trying to avoid drinking on weekends. I feel better in general but it's still a struggle for me to avoid buying a bottle on Friday nights. I get tense and annoyed at the idea that I'm "not allowed" to relax the way I want to and I have to put in a lot of active effort to avoid buying any alcohol. The stuff I'm doing is largely the same - watching TV and playing video games - but I'm not enjoying it as much. I've hear that the best thing to do is go out and pursue other activities which I've done a little of (going to the gym long walks) but at night I have the same problem with boredom and tension. I can't seem to feel energized or motivated to do things that don't involve drinking. It all feels like a lame substitute for the thing I really want to do...I've heard that that's a normal mindset to be in at the beginning and that it tends to go away after a few weeks so I'm willing to just tough it out and slowly build into other activities as I go. My problem is that it's my birthday this weekend and I don't know what to do about it. I'll see my girlfriend but I haven't really reached out to friends in a long time and I don't know what I would do with them that doesn't involve alcohol. I'm also a little worried that I'm going to end up justifying drinking to myself on the assumption that I can because it's my birthday. All I can think of right now is just treating this weekend the same as the last two and just dealing with the boredom and tension because it's a chemical and behavioral inevitability for now. Do you all have any tips for handling this though?

Happy birthday in advance of it. Why don't you bring your girlfriend out for a meal on your birthday.  Maybe she will even pay as its your birthday.  There are a list of things to do as hobbies on the FAQ page.  Have a look and see if anything tickles your fancy.  If not go to an AA meeting as it will break up the evening.  Other than that not sure.  Anyhow good luck and happy B'day.
