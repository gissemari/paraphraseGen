So for those on social media Facebook has this daily thing that shows all your posts you made over the years on today's date.  There's also an app called Timehop that does the same thing.  While its cool to look back on good memories lately when I read mine it be comes clear that I have been circling around attempting to get sober for nearly seven years LOL.  It's like I read a post from five years ago saying "I really need to focus on better things than drinking it's ruining my life" then continued with another five years of it.  I guess the point of this rambling post is it has been a good reminder/eye opener that I've really always know where I need to be and I have the tools and knowledge to take me there but I just have to continue using them.  This is my first crack at sobriety without the assist of rehab/religion/AA or anything else...but so far it feels the most "legit" and likely to stick.  ..Any of y'all feel the same way?  How long did you know you really had a problem but just kept putting it off/relapsing?

I fancy myself as pretty introspective and realistic but I was really in the binds of denial for such a long time. I KNEW I had a problem for years...maybe even ten years or more but never truly admitted it to myself (or others) in the way I did recently. It was always wishy-washy "I should really..." or "At some point I intend to..." but this time it was: *"I am tired of this shit and I'm stopping right now! I have a problem and I want your help. I'm not ashamed. This is where I have found myself at this point in time so let's work on this! Let's go!"* I switched from passive and contemplating to "Let's get this toxic situation solved."..And I am fully ready to face this. A neon-red blinking switch in my brain finally clicked. I'm mad and going to do something about it now.
I realized I really had to do something about my drinking in Oct 2013 when I started yammering private business between SO and I to anyone that would listen. 3-4 years prior to that I had a strong suspicion I had crossed the point of no return but I didn't care enough to make a change. I can't believe it's been 22 months since I started quitting. In one sense it seems like a short amount of time because I feel like I've been waging this war for **YEARS**.  On the other hand it seems ridiculous that in that amount of time/effort I still haven't kicked this beast. ..And yes if I scroll back through my own FB I find every 2nd or 3rd post to be about booze or booze influenced. Always in a fun happy 5 o'clock somewhere tone. Didn't want the world to come to the conclusion I had some kind of problem or something ya know?
