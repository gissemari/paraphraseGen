Throw away account for obvious reasons...&amp;#x200B;..I suppose the necessary background is that I was still drinking when I got married. We've been married for about two years. I stopped drinking six months ago.   ...And boy howdy is she not a fan of my decision. I'm going to stick with it because I think it's the best decision for me but it's definitely created some problems in my marriage. She's said several times over the past six months that she wishes I drank still that the weekends are boring that I'm less fun etc. I try to sympathize with where she's coming from - she just lost her drinking buddy and drinking was a big part of our relationship - but it'd be nice to have more support. ..&amp;#x200B;..I guess what I'm struggling with is I'm "realizing" a lot of things about our relationship. I'm using the quotes because I honestly don't know if this is what clarity feels like or if these feelings are normal or if I'm just too new to sobriety for it to not be overwhelming or a combination of all those things.   ...Let me explain - I'm wondering if I just married a drinking buddy. Drinking was a huge part of our relationship. We met through the Hash House Harriers and most of our social life revolved around drinking with other hashers. Now that I'm not drinking it doesn't feel like we have much else in common. The suggestions I make get shot down because she's uninterested in them and I feel the same way about a lot of her suggestions. ..&amp;#x200B;..I'm also becoming aware of what feels like a lot of codependence in our relationship. She very much wants to call the shots for all of our marriage decisions and really don't want my input (especially if it deviates from her plans). She'll stop me from doing things I want to do myself to "help" me frequently even when I don't ask for or need help. She gets resentful when I say I want to do the thing myself. I used to be much more tolerant of this when I was drinking because it meant I could drink more be less affected by hangovers etc. Now that I'm not drinking I want a say in my life and I'm feeling a little chaffed. ..&amp;#x200B;..She's also a much more negative person than I am. We just got back from vacation and every day there was something to complain about. It's too overcast it's too cold it's too windy. Then the clouds clear up and it's too bright it warms up and it's too warm the wind dies down and it'd be nice to have a breeze. The lines were unbearable. Just one thing after another. My personal feeling is that unless I can change something it's not worth complaining about. So being around this attitude so much can be hard to relate to and frankly it can make enjoying stuff I really want to enjoy harder to enjoy. ..&amp;#x200B;..In summary I'm feeling a lot of feelings about my relationship and I'm not sure how to process them. I hear about clarity coming after you get sober but I have no idea if this is what clarity looks like. Did I just marry a drinking buddy who wasn't a good fit? Or are the first few months of sobriety just really hard and these feelings are kind of normal?

Congratulations on your success in staying sober.  The view  here will probably  emphasize  that your sobriety  must be your first priority. I am amazed that  you  have  managed to  get sober on your own. And stay sober. without  any support  from  your  wife. A decision  about a marriage is as much about money and children as anything else. Be prepared to see your net worth  divided by at least two. Your age makes a difference too. . My first marriage was a disaster and I  wish I  had  pulled  the plug a lot  sooner.
I got this relationship book when I quit so I could figure out how much was coming from where and probabilities of things working out or not.  It suggested that change freaks the other one out- I mean imagine if the tables were turned?  What then?  We need an adjustment period and if things never adjust to our liking then that's just the way it is but sometimes the other one starts to see the positive side of our change and sorts of jumps into their own revolution to keep up with it and equilibrium returns.  But the book said it takes time to tell and I can see how that's true.  Idk just thoughts.  Great job not drinking man!  Right on.  IWNDWYT
