I get a newsletter from the American Psychiatric Association.  Today they posted a way to tell if you're in an addictive relationship with someone.  But it makes sense with respect to alcohol as well:..Here's a quick checklist to know if you're addicted to a toxic relationship:....You have more bad moments than good but you can't let go because you're always chasing another fix of the good.....The relationship depletes rather than energizes you.  It takes away from other areas in your life.....You lose resources (emotional financial interpersonal) but no matter how great the cost you continue with the relationship.  You can't seem to make rational calculations.....When you try to leave you can't seem to follow through; you go through withdrawals.  You cave and you relapse......You pretend every time you make up it will be different.  You consistently ignore the fact that the past is the greatest predictor of the future.  You will be back there in pain again.   But you have selective memory (i.e. denial.)....You're lying to your friends and family about the way you're being treated; you're minimizing the pain so they won't turn against your partner or urge you to do what you already know you should do which is end the relationship.....OR you've alienated good people in your life who don't want to stand by idly and watch you suffer anymore....

Awesome post! This describes perfectly my relationship with alcohol.  You consistently ignore the fact that the past is the greatest predictor of the future. You will be back there in pain again. But you have selective memory...I am not going to drink today.
Exactly ALL of this.
Wow...describes it in a way I could not.
Yup- being an alcoholic or addict is like being a battered spouse.  Great post
