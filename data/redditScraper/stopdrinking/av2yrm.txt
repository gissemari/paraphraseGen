Thank you everyone who showed their support yesterday. It was amazing and quite unexpected seeing that my previous posts didn't draw near as much attention...I'm starting my second day of no drinking and feel fine. Last night I had a little bit of anxiety but I honestly think it was just me freaking myself out a bit. I read a bit too many negative posts and stories about people relapsing on here. I have no worries that I'm going to relapse and the temptation to drink is non-existent right now...I slept well even with the nightmare that I had slipped and had 9 drinks somehow. What a relief it was when I woke up to realize it was just a dream!..Multivitamin super B complex vitamin small breakfast Gatorade for electrolytes and CBD oil keeps my mornings nice and relaxing. ..IWNDWYT!
