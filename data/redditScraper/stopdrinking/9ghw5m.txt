I'm not beating myself up about relapsing. I'm definitely mad about giving in to a craving lying to my wife and feeling like hell all day (despite having only four pints last night jeez). But I'm mostly angry at the lie we've been sold that makes this sick cycle possible. ..So I'll push back   on the messaging the culture the expectations   and learn from my mistake and move on. I know I can't have just one though I lie to my friends and say I someday might. Even if I wanted to though it wouldn't be worth the risk to the life I have...I'm going to be a father soon. I don't want my child to see me this way as a sad scheming shithead. He or she (we don't know yet) will only know me as sober. The real me. ..I've got a song that keeps me going.  Push back push back push back with every word and every breath.  Without resolve and focus this falls apart. Sobriety is not passive. I won't let my guard down again. ..Thank you for being here. ..I will not drink with you today.

Welcome back. Some people don't make it back so quickly. Some don't make it back at all.  ..IWNDWYT 
I am also careful to keep my guard up especially with time as it seems my memory of the bad stuff seems to tend to get fuzzy.......glad to see you back! It sounds like you have some really great things to look forward to! IWNDWYT 
I'm resetting my badge today too. I'm looking forward to 100 sober at Christmas. ..Best of luck to you friend. I'm glad you came back to start again!
