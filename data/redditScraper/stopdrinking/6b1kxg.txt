I had almost 2 years sober and profound  anxiety and then I relapsed a few months ago. I felt a lot of Shame for that...The good news is is I'm still sober and can you believe it my anxiety's becoming manageable! ..Just thought I would check in because in the past I've only checked in at my darkest. It's kind of nice to have a happy post from me anyway!

Glad it's working out for you. I had some experience with anxiety it can be debilitating. 
Oh deedee that's great news! It's great to hear from you!
The anxiety sucks doesn't it! It's great to hear that it's not just me. I won't drink with you today.
