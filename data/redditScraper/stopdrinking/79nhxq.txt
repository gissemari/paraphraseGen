I drank this weekend and of course I regretted it.  It's the same every time: I drink too much but feel "fine" while drinking.  3:30am I wake up and I'm crippled with anxiety night sweats dehydration the works.  Can't fall back asleep and ruin the whole day because I'm exhausted and hung over.  I'm sick of this shit.  Here's my plan for sobriety this week:.Wednesday I'm going to a concert with a friend.  I've volunteered to drive and I am planning on not drinking.  That one will be easy enough.  The next day my sister is coming into town and we're all going to a local brewery.  That's the hard one for me.  They do offer some sodas and kombucha so I think I'll go that route.  I also have requested a badge starting today and I think that will help me stay on track as well.  .I'm really feeling like I can't ever really get sober.  The longest I've gone without drinking was 12 days and it felt great.  Alcohol held no sway.  Then I tried wine and beer again-- didn't taste great and was able to recognize it for the terrible poison it was.  But I was back drinking again.  And here we are.  I don't drink every day but I drink often enough that I'm stuck in the never-ending loop of not drinking for a few days then feeling the relief of that first beer and the regret the next day.  Around I go. I don't want to keep doing this.  I'm better than this and I don't want this substance to rule my choices.

I can relate. Ive built so much of my life around alcohol. Building a new life takes time but its worth it. ..A plan really has helped me. The biggest help has been envisioning my triggers and thinking about what i will do in that instance to conquer it. They seem really insurmountable at the time but afterwards feels like a big victory.
