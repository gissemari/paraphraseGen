I've been drinking heavily for about 3 years now. I went to AA last year and stayed sober for 4 months. I loved it but some things happened and I do not feel comfortable there anymore. I also am not ready to quit smoking pot again and that's pretty looked down upon there (I can't lie to them either. I just hate lying)..After relapsing hard in December I havent stayed sober for more then a day since except for when I  got a public drunkenness arrest and didnt drink for a few weeks after. ..I miss being happy though. I have a girlfriend who I care about a lot and family who loves me. Yet I cant even bring myself to enjoy their company without getting drunk. I'm sick every morning and miserable at work but the inability to feel natural joy is whats really getting me. ..Right now I dont feel that bad. My last drink was at about 2am this morning so I have maybe 12 hours sober but I have no faith that I can last through tomorrow afternoon without some support.

Day one for me to stay strong.  You can do anything you want to for 24 hours at a time
First day here as well!
