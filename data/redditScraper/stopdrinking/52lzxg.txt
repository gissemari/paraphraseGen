First I wanted to say that I made a very heart-felt post on this subreddit in June under a different username. I received many wonderful thoughtful responses and I want to thank everyone who supported me then. I ended up deleting the post because I didn't want it to be on my post history. There is no shame in struggling with drinking but I wanted it to be a private rather than public struggle so I made this account today...Probably around the time I made that first post I decided to commit myself to 90 days without alcohol (and marijuana). Began September 1st and going strong. I wanted to share some thoughts both so I can put my feelings into words and so I might help someone else who is thinking about going 30/60/90/infinite days without alcohol make their decision...**Thought #1:** I don't actually miss alcohol really at all. But I DO miss smoking weed. Turns out weed was my preferred drug all along but I didn't realize it until I gave up both...**Thought #2:** Finding ways to have sober fun has been absolutely crucial. I'm very fortunate because I have awesome friends who were supportive of my choice and who are down to do things without getting wasted. I cannot understate how helpful this has been for me. Last night a friend and I went to a movie together. She smoked weed before I was sober. It was totally fine. The night before that a friend came over and we cooked dinner together sober. On Friday I hosted a game night at my house some people were drinking and/or getting high but I stayed sober and still had a great time. Last week I went to the beautiful Oregon coast with two friends. We made a bonfire ate snacks and went swimming naked (turns out I don't need to be intoxicated to get naked around people...never would have guessed). ..**Thought #3:** The lead up to Day 1 was more stressful than anything that has come since. How will I have fun without alcohol/weed? What will my friends think? What if September first rolls around and I don't stick to my plan--what does that mean for me? But once I started a lot of those worries melted away. As did my alcohol-related anxiety (o gosh will I blackout and do stupid shit this weekend?)..**Thought #4:** I'm doing this for me not for anyone else. And part of this is that I can explain it to people on MY TERMS if at all. I don't need to explain myself to anyone. I don't owe anyone answers. Instead of telling my friends "I think I might be addicted to alcohol so I'm doing 90 days without" I told them I'm doing a 90 day "cleanse" without weed or alcohol to get healthy lose weight and save money - all of which are true...**Thought #5:** My group of friends was always hard-partying. Turns out this may have been my doing all along. Is it a coincidence that my friends suddenly don't feel pressured to drink when they're around me now? Hmmm.......**Thought #6:** I'm so proud of myself. This is awesome. Sobriety is a great thing and I might make this a permanent change.

You are so articulate!  This was insightful and enjoyable to read.  Congrats on 13 days!  I have a question about your feelings on weed but only if you are interested in sharing.  I'm not sure what the protocol/etiquette/general feeling on marijuana is here.  Don't mean to overstep.
Doing great keep it up!
Thanks for sharing! I'm telling myself this is a 30 days cleanse just to get me through. I'm hoping it will be longer than that God willing. I also smoke weed. I haven't quit that yet because I've tried to go cold turkey on both and failed miserably. I'm interested to see when I'll be "ready" for that it you're posts makes me think sooner than later. I've cut back significantly (smoking several times per day vs. maybe once a week now) and started hanging with my friends who don't smoke at all which helps. Congrats to you and thanks for sharing! I'll be here with you for the next few weeks!! And hopefully longer than that!
