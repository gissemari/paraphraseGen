*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*...**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**...I'm pledging myself to not drinking today no matter what happens good or bad and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others..It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours let's not drink alcohol!.*****..**This pledge is a statement of intent.**....Today we don't set out trying not to drink we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!.What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up..*****...**What this is:**...A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning..*****...**What this isn't:**...A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread..*****...    This post goes up at:.    US Night/Early Morning.    Europe Morning.    Asia and Australia Evening/Night...A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar..*****...Good morning sober friends! ...My last post hosting the DCI this week..Well  What I'm going to do now at 7AM??? Help!! Haha :) ...It's been a joy and true honor! Thank you so so much for having me this week. You've all helped me to stay sober and empowered me in this journey!! I can only hope I did alright. I've tried to address some of both the struggles and the gifts in my sobriety journey so far. It is not an easy path some days but it's the best path in my life I've ever taken and the one I need to walk if I want to live. As I am wishing you a wonderful weekend (and again a HUGE thank you!!!) I will close this week with this:...**To all the lurkers**: Feel free to join us if you want to and when you are ready. You are not alone in this take the plunge we'll help you where we can! Making this pledge every day is more powerful then you can imagine! ...**To all of you on day one**: Welcome (back)! We've all had day one. Many of us multiple times. Getting started is the most important step! And so is never give up trying. ...**To all of you with milestones**: I applaud you! Celebrate each accomplishment with joy and proudness (and possibly cake and or chocolate) You deserve it! ...**To all of you in between milestones**: Keep up the good work! Just for today. ...**To all of you with one or multiple years of sobriety**: Thank you for being here letting everyone know that it can be done and thank you for supporting everyone with your wisdom and experiences! ...To myself: Faced another fear sober by doing this hosting and learned a lot!!! Check! :)...To /u/SaintHomer: Thank you for your words of encouragement en getting me set up!!! ...I'll see you around lovely brave people! Stay safe stay kind and stay vigilant!!! .I will **NOT** drink with you today whatever good or bad may happen!  ...Have a great Saturday! ...&gt;*"My Recovery must come first so that everything I love in life does not have to come last".* -Unknown- ..Cato and cats

Dear Cato thank you so much for hosting this week and for sharing such great thoughts with such clarity and truth...You remain terrific  . Love from Dublin  
Not today  
Thank you Cato all the support has been warmly welcomed. IWNDWYT although today is a tough gig with the four year anniversary of my father's death. I'm going to keep reading and rereading the posts on here to stay on track and not allow even this to be simply just another excuse for letting the cravings take over. He died unnecessarily after a day's binging on alcohol. Couldn't pull back from the catastrophic events that followed. Anyone else out there hearing me rack up another excuse right now!!!!! I'm staying strong - thank you again and thanks to every other SD on this sub today - you fill me with hope and determination x Let me say it one more time - IWNDWYT
I will not drink today
Made it!   Days!I will not drink today
IWNDWYT!   
Instead of drinking I will work on this every day to avoid slips (Sobriety Losing Its Priority).  ..Really depressed right now and I don't know why.  It's okay though I'm used to feeling this way (and often worse) everyday.  The odd bad day is to be expected this is a vast improvement.  ..IWNDWYT  ..Thanks very much for hosting this week u/SilverCato and cats.
Not today
I'm housesitting tonight and it would be the perfect opportunity to drink. No one would know but me. But I'm not drinking today.
Good morning everyone! Working today and it's nice to not feel like a hunk of crap even if I am still reeling a bit from my poor decision the other night. But tonight I think I'll go to the gym and do some exercise whilst listening to The Naked Mind and then just chill with some music!..&amp;#x200B;..IWNDWYT!
Still not drinking.  I want to given the stress I've had with eBay/PayPal this week but I'm not gonna.
I will not drink today.
Thanks for the check ins this week u/SilverCato! ..I'm not drinking today!
I won't drink today!
Over a week! I had my favorite opportunity to drink yesterday at 4. Working from home day was over pretty much wife went to the store with my kid for 90 min. Most other days that'd be a great time to throw back a couple Double IPAs and get Friday started. Instead I played it forward and threw some burgers on the grill and grabbed a seltzer. Today is the first 70 degree day of the year here and it's going to be an amazing Saturday outside with the family and zero hangover. It's 5:30am. I'm up and showered and just waiting for sunrise. ..Last Saturday I was hungover and had a headache until 3pm!..IWNDWYT!
Day 9. IWNDWYT
First day back at work after a week off. .I will not drink with you today.
I won't drink today

Morning from a wild and windy Ireland. Thanks for hosting and if I may add one thing to your post. Every additional day without the sauce is a milestone. Stay strong. IWNDWYT.
Good morning fellow sobernauts! As per usual: I will not drink with you today. Stay strong everyone... 
Still not drinking with you today.
I will not drink today! Day 6. Extra grateful for this post today. I started an antidepressant that probably won't help much if I drink with it. Ready to feel better. Thanks for the post! :)
IWNDWYT
I will not drink today.  Happy weekend everyone!
You are all SO welcome! Thank you for all the kind replies!!!! Life is still life had some bad news this morning unfortunately.

And even though a bad thing happened today: I WILL NOT DRINK WITH YOU TODAY!!
Thank you so much for  hosting this week Cato beautiful job - well done!!! ..No drinking here!
IWNDWYT
Thanks for hosting!! .I went to meet friends at a bar last night for trivia. Instead of the 18oz (+) of wine I'd usually have I drank two lemonades... and it was fine fun even. All my worrying was for nothing. No one said anything and I actually enjoyed the juice... And now I'm not hungover! maybe i can do this after all!! Iwndwyt!
Good morning everyone. Thank you so much for hosting this week Cato. Today is the start of week 10! Wishing you all a good weekend. IWND  WYT

Good morning! Cato your posts this week have really touched me and have helped get me through the week. I can't thank you enough!! IWNDWYT

Good morning from Canada SD. You did a spectacular job all week Cato.It was nice to get to know you a little better.Thanks. I will not drink with any of you fine people today 
Good morning to my sobernaut friends! Well we reached the end of the storm last night and it was only about 8 inches snow here so could be worse. Supposed to get above freezing each day including today so hopefully will all melt away again soon. I love a beautiful snowy landscape-- in December through February! Enough already Mother Nature! But everyone is thinking this each spring here in Minnesota. It's normal. I have a lot of chores to do today-- catching up after being out of town for half the week. And I'm super super exciting for the new GoT tomorrow! Busy and fun weekend here. No drinking to befoul it no no no.
IWNDWYT
Morning everyone!  Today is my second Sober Saturday (day 13) and we're heading to my in-laws for a bbq today.  They're not big drinkers but I'm sure my bro-in-law and husband will be having a few beers in the sunshine.   My favourite drinking time.  But I will bring some sparkling water and will stay strong! IWNDWYT
What day am I even on? I took a break from posting daily (which I said I wasn't gonna go but) but I'm still on that dry grind...I ate way too many wings last night (because of the "there aren't many left I'll just kill them" logic) and right now I feel pretty hungover..But otherwise I been good..IWNDWYT
Looking forward to maintaining my sobriety outdoors on the deck with the rain to end by 10AM and the temp to *zoom* from the current 59F/15C up to 76F/24C. ..I'm still shaking off this recently past abysmal winter and being outside until the much much later dark without layers and layers of heavy clothing I find to be an indescribable pleasure which I will not corrupt and ruin with intoxication...Blizzard affected folk I raise my giant thermal mug of coffee and wish all of you safety and hope that Spring warmth soon returns to your lives.
I will not drink today.
Sober Saturday for me as well. Looking forward to a good sleep tonight and a productive Sunday. IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you today! Thank you so much for hosting Cato.
IWNDWYT    
Working!? On Saturday!? Ugh. 6 day workweek can't get me down though  I will STILL not be drinking with y'all today! Let's get it SD!
Good morning SD!..Bravo! for a great week Cato!  Thank you so much for the support and positivity in checking us in each day!..I won't be drinking with y'all today!  ..Big love my friends!
Great morning. The same bird outside the window loudly wakes me up every morning at 3 a.m. but I am not minding it at all spending some time listening and then going back to sleep. Great crazy dreams and up before anyone else. Going to yoga this morning. Thinking of you all and I will not drink with you today.
On day 123. I will not drink with you today!
Hello again all...I am pledging to be sober with you all for 1 more 24 hour day. I will sleep 6 or 7 hours of that. That leaves me 17 or 18 hours only to be sober...To our friend Cato a huge thank you for the week. I have learned a lot from you and been given great reminders of many things. You did your best ( well fantastic realy ) and just think of Bill W and Doctor Bob in the first months. They pushed on and look what we have. ..I have had a great week  I have been sober and that is a bonza week for me. ..So if you wonder can I do this. I am sober against all odds. You can be too. Just don't take that first drink just for today...I have done that for over 10000 days now 1 day at a time...Take care. Your Friend John.         
Tough tough day after relapse. I can't stop hating myself for being back to square one in pain for the millionth time. I truly cannot live with alcohol in my life I'm absolutely at my breaking point.
I will not drink with you today!
I'm in. IWNDWYT  
I will not drink today.

Happy Saturday!..Lots to do today. ..A meeting and breakfast this morning. ..Then going to see my brother sister-in-law and niece. I'm not supposed to make amends to them today just focus on being nice and enjoying the time my sponsor says. I'm not ready to make amends nor currently capable of it. ..My husband and I are going to listen to Carmina Burana this evening - over 140 voices plus the city orchestra. It's going to be awesome!..I will not drink with you today!
No drinking today.
Thanks SD friends for always being there when I need a little encouragement. IWNDWYT.
Ick it's supposed to be raining and thundering all weekend. 600 days ago this would have been the perfect excuse to spend the whole time drinking. But I don't do that any more I will not drink today.
Hi Cato...Thank you for a terrific week of posts. We are all better off for knowing you.  ..IWND  WYT

Thank you Cato for all your kind and encouraging words.  ..I will not drink today  
okay we're going again. Another day. ..This week has been SO HARD. The struggle is very real. .My brain tells me to drink every night and it's taking every ounce of concentration and will to keep clear. I'm dreading 7pm tonight when the jeckell and hyde begins anew...Having faith that this will pass. IWNDWYT
Our last day of vacation at an all-inclusive resort. I skipped alcohol all day yesterday and as a result got a great night of sleep. Which was all I wanted from this vacation. Today is a travel day and we get to go home to our two boys. I don't need to drink at the airport or on the plane. IWNDWYT.
Thank you for hosting  Cato! IWNDWYT
Cato you inspired me all week with your thoughtful observations. I truly appreciate your efforts! IWNDWYT
Good morning from California!  A lovely day stretches out before me.  Husband and I will walk at the beach this morning.  We'll probably talk about how fortunate we are to live where we do and then we'll discuss kitchen cabinets!  It will be a beautiful day in which wine will have no place.  Silver Cato thank you for your words of wisdom this week!  I looked forward to reading your posts every morning.  Good people of SD IWNDWYT    Gigi
Thank you for a great week of check-ins  [u/SilverCato](https://www.reddit.com/user/SilverCato)  and cats! ..It's Saturday I have only two weeks of classes left until I complete my bachelor's degree and I'm really anxious about having to embark on the job search. Drinking WILL NOT help. Going for a run this morning might make me feel better for a while so I'll do that instead. And of course I have my cats and this great community to help me through the day. IWNDWYT
Glorious sober morning soberniks!  Have a smurftastic day! IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you today. I made the same dumb decision and had the same shitty result. I'm tired of life being this way.
Just for today. IWNDWYT.
According to my stop drinking app I am 96 days sober! And in that time I've lost about 30 lbs. ..With the aide of naltrexone and acomprosate I haven't had the craving or even the slightest desire.  I do believe these medications have helped me...Good luck to all!
Day three and i dont work tomorrow but iwndt.
Thank you for hosting this week Cato! I've enjoyed reading your posts! IWNDWYT!
Super great hosting/u/SilverCato!  Thank you!..Half installed a garbage disposal last night and then discovered it was damaged and can't lock into place.  Replacement won't be here until tomorrow so I used a car jack to push it up against the sink for now...Got a new lawnmower and going to take that for a spin this morning.  Hoping it goes better than the disposal...Feels good to be doing things around the house even if they aren't always met with complete success...IWNDWYT
Day 7 the sun is shining and IWNDWYT.
Thank you for hosting this week Cato! Great job. IWNDWYT
I will not drink today!!

Thank you Cato! Last day of a stressful trip for me and definitely IWNDWYT!!
I will not drink today!
I've never been sober for this long before... It feels so good and I'm damn proud of myself. Gonna eat some breakfast walk my dogs and have a hopefully awesome sober day...Hugs to anyone out there struggling - stay strong. This gets soo much easier with time!
I'm learning if I linger in bed too far past the I'm so glad to be waking up sober moment that's when the nagging thoughts creep in. Anything from tussling with unresolved feelings about an ex to flashbacks of stupid things I did while drinking to how much my hair is untamable. I'm resolvibg to et up more quickly to get moving and greet the day and let those thoughts dissolve into the ethers of the past. Plus today I'm going to goat yoga and that's damn exciting. IWNDWYT
Morning everyone! It's shaping up to be a beautiful warmish day in my neck of the woods and while I'll spend most of it inside catching up on paperwork at least there will be a warm breeze blowing through the window screen and sunshine falling on my work space while I get caught up. IWNDWYT!
Going to my best friends engagement party tonight. Love his fiance. Open bar. I'm very happy to be my wife's designated driver. I'll be even happier tomorrow when I'm going then watching the Masters and not hating myself. IWNDWYT
Trying to get through my first sober weekend in a long time. Woke up feeling good and hoping to continue that through to tomorrow. I will not drink with you today

Good morning and thank you for being an excellent host Cato (and cats)!..Today has been lovely so far. I've had a long walk on the beach with my son chasing birds and hunting for shark teeth. Now I am sipping a cold brew coffee while I wait for a tasty brunch. We are going fun shopping next. Later at home I will work more on my bedroom project and pass out happily tired with no alarm set. :D..IWNDWYT!

Afternoon SD IWNDWYT
Just wanted to say thankyou a heartfelt thankyou for letting me tag along. I am alone but not alone with this. I darent go out too itchy ! Everyone here is amazing.  You really are. IWNDWYT.
Day 195 of not drinking. IWNDWYT
I will not drink today.
This is the end of my day 6. Usually I'm passed out by now but with enough booze to drink again tomorrow. Until that runs out and I decide another bottle is a good idea. Then frantically try to finish it because the "rules" say I can't drink on a work day which would then lead to a massive hangover. A hangover which would then stop me from working out and make me feel shitty for most of the week...I made it and I will make it again tomorrow. I actually tidied up and did laundry today. Feels productive and I hope to be again tomorrow. IWNDWYT
Almost forgot to check in today! Welp haven't drank so far and don't plan on drinking for the rest of the day! IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you today! Thanks for hosting!
29 days sober waiting for my 1 month milestone.  I will not drink with you today!
Still reeling from a disappointing meeting with the boss on Friday... After months of being told I would be prepped and groomed for a promotion I was told that there was no room for me.  .  .We're about to transition administrative teams and while I could have  job here for life there's no path for upward development. Time to job hunt. As shitty at it feels drinking isn't going to fix this either. IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT!  
I screwed up yesterday but today I am not drinking.
Another shitty relapse last night. I feel terrible IWNDWYT
I won't drink with you today.
I won't drink with you today
Checking in today.
On the third day I found a different kind of liquid. Neutrogena bath gel! I will not drink today as I have a bath. My quads hams and back will love it!
It feels like a Sunday but it's only Saturday! My weekends feel a lot longer now without drinking. IWNDWYT
No matter how much soju I see people drinking on the mountain today I will not drink and enjoy a sober hike in South Korea!
I won't drink today.
Checking in
Day 1 again. I have been trying to quit for almost a year now and my longest stretch of sobriety was 1 month and 2 days. Hoping to turn this around finally. I will not drink today.
lets do this
20 hours in - I got this.
I refused yesterday got up at 7am on a Saturday feeling great and accomplished all my errands by noon and a bike ride! ..I went to a bar this afternoon with a ton of friends and told them all I was done. I even explained why - and didn't feel ashamed. I was still offered a lot of drinks and shots (only as inclusion not pressure) and it felt great. We were there for hours. When I left I'd only spent $5!! I went home by 6pm and I've made myself an amazing dinner and I'm watching the office. I'm SO happy! I'm so fucking proud. I now feel like I can do this. I'm glad I can come here and talk about it too because I don't have anyone else to talk about it with. ..Im proud of all the people here!
6 weeks in. It's been a struggle in some ways and easy in others so far. I was very set in my drinking routine so finding ways to break it up has been my easiest way to fight cravings. If that's not enough HALT does the trick. Life is just so much better sober... the problems are still there but now I'm handling them instead of hiding and it's quite a positive feedback loop.
I will not drink with you today.
Day 3 (again) - not drinking today! Tuna melt and La Croix instead. Tomorrow will be a good morning.
I did not drink with you today!
I will not drink tonight!
IWNDWYT
I've decided that this time - facing tough situations with losing my job complicated and painful relationship problems and feeling lonely and just sad - I will not make alcohol my crutch. I want to feel healthy and happy and drinking has never ever done that for me. ..I will not drink today.
Thank you - your replies helped me put that glass back in the cupboard and the contents of the bottle down the sink. IWNDWYT this fine Sunday either. And I have a shiny new badge I'd like to see grow  
You are so welcome! I'm proud of you. We can do this!!! IWNDWYT
