So ignore the badge because as of writing this it hasn't changed.  Not sure when that happens but Wednesday September 7th I took my last drink of alcohol and have had not a drop since then.  I could not have done it without SD.  You guys are amazing whether it's the Day1 post or the 2 year sober post.  Seein both sides of the coin the triumphs and the struggles in one place has given such perspective to this decision.  I have read posts that sound like I could have written them and other posts that make me feel grateful that it has been no worse than it has for me...Observations:.- The first three days sucked.- A full nights sleep is better than any buzz.- I make this harder than it needs to be.- I am more even tempered than I recall.- With sobriety comes the ability to focus... The reason that the work days seemed to take forever was because I was a drunk/hungover asshole and watched the clock for the next time to drink.- People are kinder when you are not walking around in a fog.- I can be the husband and father that I have wanted to be..Thank you all for your continued support thoughts and other well wishes.  I hope I can be there for some of you all as well...I am not drinking with you today!
