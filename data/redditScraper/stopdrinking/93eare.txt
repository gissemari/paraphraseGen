I'm struggling with AA.  I'm doing an AA meeting daily and I'm reading This Naked Mind and SMART.  There seems to be some conflicting ideas on what our alcohol problem is and how to to treat it.  In AA I'm asked to say my name and that I am an alcoholic every meeting.  I hate doing this.  They tell me I'm powerless over the condition.  In This Naked Mind I'm taught that alcoholism is just an unconscious mind that needs to be retaught.  I'm inclined to believe the latter but let's face it... there more of them(AA).  It helps to have others to travel this journey.  Am I over thinking things?  How do you guys deal with different in philosophies?

I can't believe I'm powerless. If I'm powerless I may as well drink because I'm not going to beat it anyway. 
My take is that I have all the power in the world over alcohol as long as it remains *outside* my body... I have no power to change the fundamental chemical interaction between the drug Ethanol and my addiction-prone brain though! Works for me.....There are various different approaches and schools of thought about what addiction is and how to treat it... my advice is take whatever bits work for *YOU* from the various philosophies and leave the rest... If the end result is that you're not putting alcohol in your mouth (and are happy about that) it doesn't really matter!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Powerless - is misunderstood misconstrued and often used as an excuse to dismiss AA which does not require you accept that or anything.   ..**MY understanding** is that once upon a time I was pretty much powerless over alcohol - as evidenced by my drinking when I had promised myself or others I would not (many times)  **this is no longer the case BUT** I remain convinced that part two of powerlessness is still there - *that if I take a drink my off switch is disabled a*nd it would take another (sooner or later) and another - and would be back in the same old shit...As for saying your name and "I am an alcoholic" - I do it because I have come to believe it is true - some times I call myself a drunkard (also true) confused puppy and more.   ..**"The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking"** \- if anybody gives you shit - point to the traditions on the wall where it says that it's number 3.  So say your name or make one up - really nobody cares and say "I have a desire to quit drinking." no labels required...Thing that I have come to understand is that ALL the interpretations are right / and wrong to some degree (especially if I let my inner lawyer loose).  Getting hung up on the definitions kept me slipping and sliding for a while - as I searched for a loophole with my name on it. Turns out there wasn't one and the special unique snowflake I imagined myself to be needed to melt into ordinary water...good luck stay in touch
&gt;I'm asked to say my name and that I am an alcoholic every meeting. I hate doing this...So don't.  The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking.  If you want to be Just Sergio With No Qualifier nobody will have a problem with that...&gt;They tell me I'm powerless over the condition...That's up to you.  And if you have power over it then quitting should be no problem right?.
I would stick with one program and work it best you can.  I'm a AA guy and AA and the rooms saved my life so I'm a believer.  I don't know anything about other programs so I can talk intelligently about them.  As for the powerless over alcohol thing you are indeed powerless if you are a problem drinker and can't stop drinking.
I remember being hung up on the word "alcoholic" when I first joined AA.  I had a problem using this word because I knew it meant that I could probably never drink like a normal person ever again.  When I first joined NA I had an issue calling myself an "addict".  In my opinion these are just words.  At AA I call myself an "alcoholic."  At NA I usually call myself an "addict and a drunk."  An old timer at AA says "I'm John and I have afflictions of addictions."..AA taught me that no one can label me as an alcoholic except for myself. No one seems judgmental when a newcomer does not self-identify as an alcoholic.
The fundamental purpose behind any and all of these paths to sobriety is unified:  to not drink.  Whatever path gets me there is a matter of preference.  The goal is one and the same.  IMO.  
I don't struggle with the different philosophies.  ...I got sober in AA that is what works for me.   There are so many different paths on the journey of sober living I always recommend that you find one that works for you and stick with it.  ...As for powerlessness over alcohol I lose any semblance of power the moment I start drinking it.  That is what the powerlessness discussed is about.  ...Also yes in my experience alcoholics want to overthink anything that is to simple to be true.  ...Like if you don't take the first drink you won't get drunk.  If you do what is suggested your life will change.  Many are like wait that is just to simple what am I missing?   So they just have to continue to research any and all methodologies of recovery instead of focusing on one and going forward but then again that is just my experience and observations that I have picked up one day at a time over the period of a few days of living sober.  ...Be good to you. 
I found the program of AA to be sufficient to recover.  I identified with the disease and the progression of it as described in the Doctor's Opinion and Chapter 2 of the book Alcoholics Anonymous.  Alcohol was my only substance so I heard my problems echoed in the shares.  And I listened to the solution those people used.  ..The traditions really hooked me. I like it because it is independent self-supporting and has a single purpose.
