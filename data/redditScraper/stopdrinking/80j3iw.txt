I lost my dad to cancer when I was 20 (now 28) and didn't know how to cope with it. Seeing the man I looked up to my entire life reduced to a shell of himself I couldn't handle it so I started drinking. I turned 21 a month after he passed and it began to spiral out of control from there. Mixing depression/anxiety with alcohol and drugs obviously the best way to go  I can see now the majority of my friends have issues with alcohol and drugs so it was never hard to find someone to go out with on the nights I wasn't sitting at home drinking by myself. I never thought anything of it as all my friends were out with me but I finally realized I was no longer in control. My struggle has always been with alcohol but with the friends I associate with most of the time there are additional temptations that I occasionally partake in...I was out with my friends recently and I had quite a few drinks then someone had a blunt that we passed around between a few of us just like the good ole days. We walked back inside after finishing up and someone was railing a line in the kitchen. They offered me the bill they used but knew I couldn't do it. I started having a panic attack so I walked back outside to get some air and had to have someone come pick me up because I knew I couldn't drive. ..I haven't really gone out with them the past few months as they typically have additional party favors that I no longer wish to be a part of but I wanted to see how I'd do being around them. These are my best friends since high school and I feel like I can no longer hang out with them if I want to get better. I love these guys like brothers but I feel like they're still stuck in the party phase. Every time we get together it's everyone sitting around just drinking or smoking instead of going out to do something without getting drunk. Should I be upfront with them about my struggles and let them know them know I can't come around if they continue doing these things or what do I do?..Sorry for the long post but I'm having a hard time with this. I don't want to lose these friends but I feel like that may be what's necessary for me to get better. .

Lots of folks around here practice "dry people dry places." You might have to do that for a few months until you find your footing. Personally hanging out with drunk people is annoying/boring for me so I've been avoiding it.

Do you ever suggest doing other activities with them? Say watching a movie or going to a concert or something?..Maybe if you decline invitations to go out drinking one or more of them will notice and reach out to you to see what's up. That might be a good time to start a conversation...In any case friends come and go but the real friend stick around. I'm sure that even if you focus on yourself and your sobriety for a while it'll be picking things up like nothing ever happened (friendship-wise) with your buddies.
