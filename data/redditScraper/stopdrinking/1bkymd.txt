----------immediate responses--------

Just took up running again on Monday for the first time since November. Running 5km twice every day. All this extra energy has me absolutely buzzing.
Yay Wednesday!..I went to an AA meeting on Monday my second ever although I regularly attend Al-Anon (my regular Al-Anon meeting was cancelled cuz of Easter).  ..Listening to people there I came to realize that addicts do not get over being addicts.  Addicts who don't drink are usually just addicted to something else (smoking eating exercise meetings etc.).  I stopped drinking 130 days ago and it was relatively easy.  But I have been giving into some bad food habits and I have been exercising a lot (just finished a 33 day running streak).  I realized that I can't just not drink I have to find healthy addictions so that I don't give into my unhealthy ones...People should feel free to disagree with me because I'd love to hear other peoples' views but that's my reflection on addiction as it stands right now.
Have returned from two month trip to southwest cut short but that is ok..Have lots of chores but nothing too crazy..Resuming my service work - AA meetings in prison tonight that was something I had missed doing..
hello everyone!..triumph: faced worst week ever at work and ended up in HR. i pleaded my case came out on top and received a raise. i felt like drinking to relieve stress but didn't.  i have a week off to relax and regroup. ..struggle:  my communication system with my SO has become flawed as of late. sometimes she doesn't want to hear of the wonderful me i've become. i have to work on sharing instead of taking and being a dry drunk...it's nice here in northeast USA.  i can't wait to take my daughter hiking.

Thanks for posting NMBP!..**Triumph**: Things are going well in a general way.  Work is going well I feel healthier I'm generally happy and I'm really looking forward to Spring weather (it's still in the 20s/30s F in the mornings)...**Struggle**: I've been tired lately.  Instead of just getting up when my alarm goes off I've wanted to go back to sleep.  This morning I decided not to ride the bike because I'm just tired and sore.  I'm pretty sure though that if I didn't already have Krav Maga scheduled for tonight after work I would have gotten up to ride.  I guess it's a good sign that I feel like a bum for sleeping all the way until 7:30 and that I'm only working out once today.  Such a major change from barely waking up by 9:30 to be at work by 10 and doing NO physical activity for a couple years...Keep it going everyone!
What's up y'all?..Triumph: nothing specific.  Still at it...Struggle: still feeling mild anxiety.  Had a mini-tantrum yesterday.  After asking the kids approximately one billion times to get ready to leave the house I lost my composure and started crying. Freaked my 8 year old right the hell out and she started crying too.  Lovely...General chat: have to cut the grass this weekend.  It's finally looking like spring.
Triumph:  I haven't drank this week with elevated urges and some high emotions...Struggle:  Easter Holiday and today is my birthday - I miss my wife and kids...General: Although my birthday will be a bit lonely I'll not be drinking.  I'm not certain how many birthdays I'd have to go back to one in which I wasn't drinking beer - feels good man.
Hello sobernauts: my triumphs are that I overcame some crazy alcohol cravings while travelling and I've been celibate for 4 weeks.  (Random sex was a big part of my drinking and a crutch for my self esteem) My struggle is that I'm insanely attracted to somebody in my immediate AA support group and I think it may be mutual.  Ohhhh lordy.
Triumph: I was asked to share again at my noon meeting yesterday.  My sponsor was present so that was cool. I'm also starting to get some of those 9th step promises.. .Struggle: I'm not really struggling on anything at the moment.  I feel happy content and at peace.  I think I'll reflect on this and try to hold onto it as long as possible.. .General: IMO the season openers for Game of Thrones and Dr. Who were awesome.  The season finale to The Walking Dead was weak sauce.  Also Easter is over so Easter-themed M&amp;Ms are half-price.  I can haz the diabeetus?..
**Triumph**: I've managed to properly account for my debts/finances and while they still suck at least I have a starting point. I've also cleaned and organised and just chipped away at the clothes pile that's needed sorting for aaaaaaaages...**Struggle**: I'm exhausted. I haven't been sleeping well lately...**General Chat**: Today is Cheeseburger and All Things David Tennant day. So in about four or so hours I'm going to fill my bacon and grease quota for this month. Also happy Fish Fingers and Custard Day!
Today are six months since I last got wasted and six months since I last smoked. Today was also a pretty good day especially compared to the last two weeks that have been pretty tough.

**Triumph**:  This is the longest I've been sober in over 5 years and so far my cravings haven't been too bad.  ..**Struggle**:  I would have thought that cutting out 12k calories a week from beer would have led to some bigger weight loss but it's staying pretty constant right now.  Also my energy levels are really low.   Normally I'd get home from work and drink until midnight or later but now I'm just exhausted after about 7pm.  Once my schedule gets a little more set in stone I'll get to the gym.  Hopefully that'll take care of it.
Hey guys..First time in the subreddit. I've had one of the worst weeks in a long time consisting of my Aunt passing away a friend of mine from my childhood being gunned down and another friend facing federal prison. I just got asked to step up in the company I work for (with no raise just to see how I can do I guess?) and I am currently talking with a few lovely ladies and dating around trying to find someone I connect with and who respects my decision to stay sober. I feel like I have all this good stuff goin' on for me in my life but I feel empty. 
Yay Wednesday check in is still going strong : )..Triumph: Most days I am too busy doing stuff I love to even think about drinking. I freaking love my new life. I've been lifting weights feeling strong just feeling alive and tuned in...Struggle: Some days I think it is too easy and it makes me suspicious. But I will take this rollercoaster as it comes...General chat: Summer is coming! I am so excited! And this year I will not be too hungover for long walks beach trips camping hiking picnics bike rides....
Triumph: I have 121 days sober and only rarely wish to drink. I've been having more dreams about drinking but they don't play into my day to day. I have been crocheting like a mofo and finished my first ever baby blanket for a friend last week. ..Struggle: Finding a job and moving past my anxiety to effectively communicate to a potential employer that I'm employable. ..General: I live in Phoenix there's no snow. 
triumph: had a very powerful urge to drink last night. as my shift came to an end i almost resigned myself to grabbing some beers. instead i drove home and told myself "just go home and then stop at the liquor store later." then i waited until 9 30pm (stores close at 10 here) and i said "just finish this youtube video and hop over there quick after." then it was 9 52 and i told myself "you still got time." and then i didn't have time and the stores closed and i made it one more day. and by that time i was very much enjoying my cup of tea and the third "a song of ice and fire" book and was happy that i didn't drink. even happier when i woke up feeling great this morning.  ..struggle: tonight will be the same battle. ..general chat: i wish i had more money so i could go travel somewhere exotic. 
I am feeling great !
Triumph:   18 weeks today.  Had to buy new pants.   Never been happier to be in a Wal-Mart checkout line I tell ya...Struggle:   Hit a major wall emotionally.  No motivation to do anything.   Feels different than the ups and downs of the last four months.  I don't know if it's the endless winter or what.  I am a zombie right now...General:  Patton.
GET OUTTA HERE SNOW! You've overstayed your welcome.
Triumph: Doodled yesterdy taking time to draw something for the first time in years and it actually came out stunningly well and it's a piece of art I'm proud of.  Started running again.  Actually about to go on one now.  Sleep schedule is wonky again as I got back to day 1 over the weekend but hopefully exercise and time will fix that.  Officially have my first working shift at my new job on Friday.  Can't come soon enough as I'm currently.....Struggle: ..skating the line of financial ruin.  Still separated with the girlfriend.  Still trying to give her space.  The idle moments and negative thoughts that flood in when I'm alone need to be dissuaded by busy healthy activity and social support...General Chat: My long-distance buddies got together and decided to revive my WOW account.  They are thinking of me due to the breakup stuff and this was a simple "hey man let's do something pointless together and tell dick-and-fart jokes on teamspeak since we all live so far apart these days.  We're thinking of you and we don't want you to be lonely."
**Triumph:** Still sober still alive. I got some stuff done around the house that I'd been neglecting for too long which is big for me because I tend to obsess on certain (read "fun") things rather than pay attention to the whole spectrum of responsibilities...**Struggle:** My wife and I are moving to another country later this year. She's shared with me her concerns about being away from her family and support system. She bought us copies of Gottman's "The Seven Principles of Making Marriage Work". My ex and I spent a lot of time with a Gottman trained counselor and seeing this book again is bringing up some pretty profound feelings: I'm a failure of a husband I'm too cold and distant (read "broken") to make a relationship work even after 4+yrs sober I'm still making the same mistakes I was before. I'm trying to sort through these feelings and get to the core of why I've always felt broken and alienated from everyone else for as long as I can remember...**General Chat:** F1 season is in full swing and it's finally warm enough to do location photoshoots!
Bad news: Spent the last 3 weeks drinking almost constantly bringing to an abrupt halt nearly 8 months of sobriety...Good news: Got my act together and haven't drunk anything in 48 hours now. Not feeling  too bad. Here's to another attempt!
Triumph: multiple parties attended oh so many drink offers refused. ..Struggle: There is a bottle of wine sitting in my hotel room right now. But I can handle it (not drinking it that is). Starting to question the industry I've chosen to work in. ..General chat: just glad everyone is here when I need you. 
Easter went to a friends house who was having a Jell-O shot Easter egg hunt and all were taking shots. Spent night smoking weed and doing sunny d shots while surprised at my sobriety they were supportive of me as a person. Didn't drink didn't even want to.
Triumph: Went to a party for a friend's birthday. Most people there were getting wasted. I happily drank my root beer and no one questioned it but the real triumph was that I was damn near the life of the party. We were all laughing and singing and generally being so loud that the next day my voice was hoarse and my abs hurt...Struggle: Things are going really well for me right now. I'm taking it one day at a time and soaking up all the good that's come my way recently...General Chat: My house has been clean for 87 days straight! It's a sober miracle!
