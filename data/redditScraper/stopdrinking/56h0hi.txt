Hi everyone..So my story (like many probably) since June I've been in a terrible cycle of succeeding with not drinking and then failing. I'll go two weeks totally clean and then for whatever stupid reason-- my brain thinks it's ok for me to have one.  ..Some background: I am officially divorced from a person with whom I developed and maintained terrible drinking habits for 7 years with. I started cutting down as of Sept 2015 and suggested that he does he same and I was always met with "you're the one with the problem" or "I had to deal with your shit for years". I got tired of hearing this.  Long story short I eventually left. I was never going to get healthy by staying...  I am with one of the most amazing people I have ever known now but unfortunately  I have taken some of my awful drinking baggage with me. He has done everything with helping me by locking up his booze holding on to my credit cards (which I give him voluntarily) and periodically asking me how I'm feeling. Like he's gone above and beyond for me in helping me get sober and I've fucked up so many times by sneaking alcohol and disappointing him...So here I am again. But only this time I'm equipped with antabuse regular therapist appointments and a Wednesday appointment for a vivitrol shot...I struggle with so much guilt most of the time (which is why I relapsed) but I'm moving forward. ..I will not drink today...Thanks for taking the time to read this. I'm a lurker most of the time and your stories help me continue this difficult path to sobriety. You all are amazing.
