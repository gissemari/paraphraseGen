My friends father has been sober for 16 years and I gave him a phone call today telling him what im in about my inevitable relapse I had and the stress im going through. He told me that I have 2 choices drink and probably be dead by the time im his age or stop and give myself a chance.  He recommended I look into going to some sort of meeting and see how I feel about it. I guess he personally didnt go but he said I have to atleast try it. Anxiety is still here a little but this withdrawal has been fairly easier then the last. I have 24 hour duty on the notorious day 4 tomorrow so ill be lurking tomorrow. Thanks for listening guys.

Tomorrow is your day to shine!  Hang in there :)
I go to aa mtgs it helps because i meet some good people who are doing the same thing i am trying to do.
Good work on this phone call.  That is a "moving the feet."  Keep doing this sort of thing and always remember we only do this 1 day at a time.
