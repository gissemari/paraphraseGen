So I've been trying for so long. It seems like I've had times before a moment of clarity where despite my mental fog from my hangover i realized that i can and will stop. ..But I've always relapsed. ..Thinking only a couple wont kill you. Hangovers will pass.. Whatever to continue my brain would find a reason. .But i had that again today but realizing all the shit I've put myself through just to get drunk.. My stomach hurts acid is coming out both ends basically. .I spent 20 dollars on just stuff to try and make my hangover more bearable. .Yet I'll still be miserable suffering at work for about 8 hours more or less. Not counting all the money I've spent every other time. ..The time and pain alcohol is putting me through doesn't outweigh my happiness I get from it nor the pain that it stops...Today starts a journey to try to get better...If you have any doubts that today is the day to stop drinking cast them aside.

I've been through the exact same thing so many times over far too many years...You're not alone.
Have you read This Naked Mind? It changed my thinking on alcohol for the better. Highly recommend. 
Good luck on your journey. Wishing you every success!
