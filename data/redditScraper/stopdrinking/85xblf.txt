This anniversary really snuck up on me. I don't have many people to share it with but I knew y'all would understand. It's my day off work and I'm out being mom to a 20 month old toddler. It's hard but it's really nice knowing that I've never neglected him due to being drunk or driven with him after having something to drink. My fuck ups and my victories all belong to me. I'm not a perfect mom but I'm a sober one. I've never shown up to my current job hungover or missed a day due to withdrawals. I have as many problems maybe more now that I'm sober but they're not as daunting as they used to be. I'm still cleaning up messes from my drinking days but I'd rather do that than continue to run. ..I am a very average person. I don't consider myself remarkable in any way.I don't consider myself remarkable in any way. This is the longest I've been sober since drinking became a problem and this is after multiple relapses. I suppose what I'm trying to say is that if three years sounds like a long time and sounds like something that it took a remarkable set of skills to accomplish I can assure you that three years is not very long and that it took nothing more remarkable then being honest. If I can do it anyone can.
