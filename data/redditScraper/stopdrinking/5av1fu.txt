Checking in with you all after six months of happier healthier booze-free life. This is the longest I've gone without any kind of substance in me in 22 years. I feel alive in a way I haven't since I was a kid and every day feels like a wonderful gift. Tonight I celebrate by not drinking with all of you who are taking your own journeys! Thank you for sharing your support your struggles and your stories of success with us.
