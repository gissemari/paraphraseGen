I went to my in-laws for Thanksgiving.  They are pretty heavy drinkers but I hadn't had anything in 39 days so Iwas feeling confident I could just do my own thing...We arrived on Wednesday night.  First thing out of their mouths was that there was beer in the garage and bourbon in the liquor cabinet.  I ended up having one drink and stopping there.  I'm not sure what made me give in.  It wasn't the first time I had been around alcohol since stopping.  On Thanksgiving I had a couple the same for Friday and Saturday...My breakdown happened when I got home on Sunday night.  I ended up staying up late drinking carried on through Monday and Tuesday going through a handle of vodka plus a bit more.  Yesterday I woke up feeling awful.  I came in to work for a meeting and left shortly after.  Last night I barely slept.  I was exhausted but my heart was going crazy and I just laid there for most of the night.  Today I still don't feel well.  I'm not sure if that's from the alcohol or the lack of sleep (probably both)...I have a lot of time off in December.  I need to keep busy so I don't do the same thing again.

The only way I can stay sober is by not picking up that first drink - sounds so simple yet it's incredibly hard to do so I take it one day sometimes one hour at a time. I think it's great that you're already planning to stay busy during your down time. Be strong and be kind to yourself. We are all here cheering you on. I will not drink with you today.
Welcome back and congrats on 39 days sober! I have relapsed many times but the more I come hear and read people's stories the more I'm able to identify my own triggers. I feel compassion to others stories and therefore am able to feel compassion toward myself. Seeing a therapist for the past year has also really opened my eyes to why I felt the need to drink for relaxation stress release connection escape acceptance etc. IWNDWYT
