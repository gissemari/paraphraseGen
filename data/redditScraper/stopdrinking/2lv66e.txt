today marks 10 months since decided to stop drinking and make my life in to something better. i couldn't be happier. i've progressed so much personally emotionally artistically and financially i know i could never take another drink and risk forfeiting all i've gained in such a short time...to those struggling through the first days and months stick with it. stopping drinking doesn't magically fix everything wrong with your life but will eventually put you in a state where you can work on things instead of ignoring them. it will definitely make you question some hard stuff about yourself but who doesn't need to do that at some point?..the drinking dreams have stopped the cravings much more transient and manageable and i just have so much time to work on me. i highly recommend it. ..edit: forgot to add that this place has been instrumental in my continued sobriety. who could ask for anything better than an active support group of people who know what you're going though on tap. certainly better than anything else on tap (sorry i love bad jokes).
