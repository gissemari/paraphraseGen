To my psych appointment and then to the State Park for a picnic with the family. I am not feeling so positive at the moment...the cravings hit the second I got up and I feel...super-depressed right now for ???? reason. I have no reason to feel bad...I just do...It is now almost 12 noon. I will not drink for the next hour...Sigh. :(..I am ok guys...just struggling...Ty for reading...~LG

I hear you LG. Those first few days for me I had an awareness (real or imagined) of a lot of recalibration and rewiring going on in the body and a bit of a battle between old entrenched dependencies vs. the growing sense of physical mental and spiritual freedom from the poisoning I'd been doing to myself...Hour by hour works .. I found it got significantly better after that day 345 kind of stretch.  Hang in there.
