Edited to add that I am really needing support on this one. Maybe a picture of a cute puppy or kitty. Maybe some encouragement. Maybe an Internet hug. Anything really. I am really struggling with this...Ill try to make this is as short as possible. But growing up with an alcoholic mom who also had other addictions to pills that she stole from work primarily birth days have been etched in my mind as painful days filled with chaos. I know that there is the great suggestion to reclaim my birthday but I'm not there yet...Yesterday due to my anxiety depression etc ( I did two social things with my husband but had to cancel the 3rd because I was too exhausted and unwell) I got into a fight with my husband. I am the first to say that he is a loving and supportive husband and that I am typically the one creating chaos in the relationship. But this time I believe he was in the wrong. Not because he is a bad person but because he does not understand..There are times that I have to cancel plans because of my emotional well-being. This causes my spouse to feel like I am flaky unreliable and selfish. His feelings are valid. But the fact of the matter is is that sometimes I am unreliable. I have to put my alcoholism recovery and mental wellness first. Too add I also have a diagnosis of bipolar...Yesterday I was so upset I wanted to drink. Literally to spite him. How immature and ridiculous! Fortunately I didn't...I also had suicidal and selfharm thoughts for the first time in a long time. Didn't act on them glad I didn't. But that just goes to show how rough it was...Today is going to be tough for me. My husband wants me to go out and do something with him an interest he has that I don't share. Typically I will go with him because I think it is fun to do things outside of my comfort zone and to spend time with my husband. But this place has thousands of people and even thinking about it causes panic...So while I am going to try and be as calm as possible and I do believe I was calm in articulating my needs yesterday things could go south again today...Fuck birthdays.

Firstly  Happy Birthday!  Sorry you share my hatred of them for similar reasons. ..In fact it was my 38th this year when I fell off a 10 month wagon :(..You're not going to do the same miss so put your big girl pants on and have a 38th birthday for both of us.  Mmkay? ;)
This too will pass :)..Sending love...
Happy Birthday!! I'm 38 too!!..202 days is nothing to sneeze at. You've done some awesome great stuff already to get that far. 
Hang in lady!  It's just one day albeit one emotion-filled day that you can get through and then it will be in the past.  Is your hubby up for alternative activities that may be better for your state of mind?  How about just a movie out?..As requested:..[kittens &amp; puppies!](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/EylDi0Dxrn0/maxresdefault.jpg)..
I actually can't envision myself leaving the house today. But thank you for your suggestion. I am filled with a lot of really hard to deal with feelings and anxiety so I am going to stay home. Thank you for the pictures!

Happy SOBER Birthday {{hug}} and I'm with you about not handling birthdays all that well.  In my case I grew up in extreme poverty and I always felt that any expenditure for my benefit drew unwanted attention.  Despite achieving substantial affluence later in my life I continue to get resentful and squirrely around my birthday. If I were you I would make your husband go get you a piece of cake or some candy--something he has to do as a quest then thank him for being so thoughtful.
[Happy birthday](http://sunnylol.com/images/2012/December/12/50c87d8f3a5a9.jpg) - Try to be good to yourself today.  You have survived 38 years on this Earth and you are working towards making yourself the best you you can be.
I hope your day gets better. &lt;3  Here are some cute doggies to cheer you up:.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8DiOthAKek.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG8njOXLza8.
[Happy Birthday!](http://media.salon.com/2015/01/dog_hug_cat.jpg)  Do whatever you want(or need ) to do today. I like to spend a week celebrating. This way there isn't too much pressure to make one day everything I want it to be. Take care of yourself! xok
