I wanted to let you all know what helped me. Joseph Prince is a great pastor who will help you feel God's love and forgiveness for you and not feel any shame or guilt that would make you relapse. There are many full sermons of his on YouTube and he has changed my life in many ways included making me feel the forgiveness I have in Christ and my freedom from alcohol. God has a plan for everyone no matter their past and He loves you all the same as if you'd never done anything wrong (still gotta accept Jesus as savior though).
