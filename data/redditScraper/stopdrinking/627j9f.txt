Yesterday and today have been tough. No particular reason. Just been thinking about it frequently and halfway convincing myself that one drink one day wouldn't make a difference. I know better and I'm not going to give in. But damn. It's hard today.

&gt; one drink one day wouldn't make a difference..For me that may be true but I'll never know because it wouldn't be 'one drink' or 'one day'.  Still when I have those thoughts I find that my own life has stalled in some way and I try and find something new to do a routine to break to get something different to look forward to and focus on.
Hang in there. I have always found my cravings to be much shorter than the hangovers :)
