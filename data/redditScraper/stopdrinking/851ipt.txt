I had the most cathartic meeting tonight. My usual group was FULL to the brim. People from out of town attending our meeting. People sharing. People getting coins. People recommitting. I felt hugged by everyone. ..I was supposed to go to a bar tonight. No intention of drinking. But I decided to go to a meeting instead and have coffee with my friend in the program. I don't have a sponsor yet but I want one. We cried together. Hugged each other. I feel so good and positive. ..I do worry about relapsing again I'm not going to lie. I know the lure of alcohol and drugs gets stronger the more positive about life I feel which is some bullshit. But damn right now I feel on top of the world. ..IWNDWYT.

Thank you for sharing here as well.
I like this:..**chase after sobriety as hard as you chased booze** ..Centres me right away screws my head on straight every time I get  out of line' in my thoughts maybe you'll like it.  I will not drink with you tonight .
It's good you worry about relapsing. People who don't worry about relapsing at 9 days often... end up relapsing...Are you in service at all? If not now is a good time to make that happen. Find an open commitment at a meeting and if there aren't any at the moment then make a commitment to show up early and help set up chairs or stay late to clean up or something that allows you to help out at the meeting. Remember we need to give it away to keep it. So when you are feeling good *that is the time to help*..And while I'm being a bossy-butt (sorry it's one of many bad habits please don't scold me mods!) stay away from bars for awhile. There's no point in making life harder for yourself. ..Thanks for your post and keep up the good work!
