No you are not drinking today
I've made a commitment to just not drink for the next 24 hours I know that's doable. If I start trying to think longer term than that I get myself in trouble.
Sure a couple shots sounds great to me too!..But you know what sounds *even better*?..Not being hungover tomorrow. Not spending money I don't need to. Not consuming empty calories. Not worrying about what I will do when drunk and/or blacked out. Not risking a DUI. Not risking stupid injuries. ..Also the knowledge I made another day sober. And not feeling guilty about what I did.
I failed guys. Got four nips. I'm sorry. I feel like I don't belong here. I'll never be able to stay sober like you guys.
Hi I put water and sparkling water where I normally put the wine and put away all the wine glasses. It was difficult yesterday (Day 2) but I felt great today.
