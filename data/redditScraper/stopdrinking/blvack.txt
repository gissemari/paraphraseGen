So after 70ish days I caved and had a drink on Sunday. In retrospect the cravings had been building up for a while and I didn't work hard enough to to get through them..Having a drink did make what was promising to be a terrible day a better one I did enjoy it but I am under no illusion I stole from tomorrow to pay for today..It's Tuesday now and I'm still feeling the ill effects of just one bottle of wine and 2 double gins. My eating and sleeping are all over the place and I feel stupid and slow..I am treating this as a  hiccup' in my journey and not resetting my counter I have no plans to drink again for the foreseeable future. I used to beat myself up so much when I relapsed usually drinking the day after to cope with the disappointment I felt. But today I feel like meh these things happen and one day out of 70 is a huge improvement! .I will be sticking close to this group again for a while and staying vigilant to make sure I don't make any more mistakes.
