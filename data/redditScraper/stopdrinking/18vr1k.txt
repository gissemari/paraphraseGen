It's a great feeling knowing that who I was doesn't have to be who I am Today...Struggle: Not listening to old thought patterns.  They try their best to sneak in...General chat: Is it spring yet?..Have a good 24 hours folks!
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph:  Finding more and more non-alcoholic beverages I really enjoy!..Struggle:  Dealing with lack of energy :(.  When I was drinking I was still a gymrat but lately I've just been worn out when I get off work and don't have the motivation to work out.  I'm sure it'll pass but right now it's frustrating...General chat:  Scary stuff in my neck of the woods.  http://www.kshb.com/gallery/news/news_photo_gallery/photos-massive-fire-at-jjs-on-the-country-club-plaza-in-kansas-city
Triumph: told a very close friend about how I've quit.  She was very supportive and nonjudgmental...Struggle: Like Annie energy is low this week.  Yesterday I ate everything in sight...General chat: can't wait for spring break next month.  We're going to go camping if it's warm enough and while we're there my baby will turn 6!
Thanks for posting these each week.  I look forward to them...Acting in new and healthier ways is a good thing.  I'm doing the same...**Triumph**: I've lost a total of 38 pounds in the last 6 months.  It's enough that people notice and comment.  Makes me feel good.  With only a few exceptions I've worked out (stationary bike even days sit/push-ups odd days) every day but 3 since Jan 1...**Struggle**: My weight loss has significantly stalled.  I've been using MyFitnessPal to track my progress.  But I really haven't modified my eating habits much.  I think I may have to do that to lose more.  I have about 30 to go...**General Chat**: Can't wait for spring either.  My tennis racket is calling to me!
Triumph: Found a job with a great company and I will move and start next week...Struggle: Very poor. My bank account is so empty!..About to hit day 40 and things are going a lot better than I expected. The table next to my bed that used to be covered in empty cans has been can free for quite a while and we threw a house party here over the weekend and I wasn't tempted to drink at all.
Ah is this a weekly tradition? I like it! ..Triumph: I'm sober! It feels awesome! Also since I haven't been drinking after work I haven't been spending my tips and I have a wallet full of money that I am excited to drop in the bank. I've been able to afford other things I want...Struggle: A lot of feelings are popping up stuff I thought I dealt with. I also get so excited about being sober that I want to rush ahead of myself and fix all the things right now! Not terribly helpful but better than what I felt 12 days ago...General chat: Ooh spring you say? I was just thinking last night how awesome this spring and summer are going to be. I always plan to do fun stuff in the summer like go to the beach forest preserve camping long bike rides yada yada. However I always ruin those plans because when you get off work at 3-4 in the morning and then sit around drinking for another hour it is really hard to get up before 1pm feeling good. I got done at 2:30am came home and went straight to bed and woke up at 10 naturally. I feel like I have so much more time today!

50 days! yeah me! it's been probably 15 years since I've gone this long without. Better late than never! thanks to all of you!!.General chat: I thought it was spring fresh snow this morning :(
I'm still here! ..Triumph: Moderation plan still going okay. 33 sober days out of the past 45 and counting. Two pounds lost. That is two pounds of wine! ..
Triumph: Got my ADHD diagnosis started medication and everything is **awesome**..Struggle: None right now thank you...Wait what does this have to do with drinking?  Well after I quit drinking I realized my life was a disaster and it wasn't getting better with time and work. To make a 3 month long story short last week I was diagnosed with ADHD which I believe I was attempting to self-medicate with alcohol and caffeine (pro tip this does not work!). Since I've begun medication and therapy my life has improved immeasurably and my addictive cravings and thoughts (alcohol caffeine) have gone away...I'm not saying this is a solution for anyone else but it was for me. I feel like I can finally start living!..[edit] to make it clear I will always see myself as an alcoholic and I will not - can not - ever drink again. I'm not 'cured' but the cravings have gone away and my life is getting better.
**triumph** on my way to three weeks :).**struggle** dealing with issues (tend to continue to put my head in the sand).**general chat** um um.... I'll listen (read) on this occasion. .**comment** good spot this sub reddit. Thanks to all for being so friendly and supportive.
Thanks NoMoreBeersPlease!  Love the hump day updates!..Triumph: 23 days! More productive than ever!..Struggle:  It's still tough especially realizing the gap between alcoholics and non-alcoholics.  ..Last night I went out with my current beau to a show.  By 9pm I commented "if i were drinking right now I'd be drunk.  I'd have had two drinks at dinner and two drinks here and then at least two more at the show."  He laughed and said "Just pace yourself.  Have a glass of water between drinks!"..Ahhh... haha... that's not how it works for my little reptile brain!..General chat:  Is it spring?  I think it's almost spring because it is POURING RAIN today!  Looking forward to a hot bath and reading a book tonight.
