I would've been a sweaty shaking mess 7 months a 2 days ago but instead i sit at my computer completely well rested and relaxed with the whole day ahead of me. ..Everyone is asleep just me my coffee and the birds chirping on a serene Sunday morning life feels good today and to those of you who may be struggling i firmly promise that i will not drink with you today.

Wow it's already tomorrow morning there? It's still early yesterday evening here :)..Hangover-free mornings are amazing aren't they? ..Even if we're on opposite sides of the planet I Will Not Drink With You Today :)

And I firmly promise that I will not drink with you today too. 
You must be on the other side of the world from me because I'm still squarely in Saturday evening. :) What happened today? IWNDWYT. 
Morning here(Romania) as well and enjoying my coup of coffee :) Cheers!
