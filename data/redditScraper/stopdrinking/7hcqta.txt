So I've got almost a year under my belt and for some reason I'm really feeling restless and missing a glass of wine. Came out of nowhere and I'm wondering why? Is it the holidays? The decorating without a glass? Maybe it's the realization that this isn't just for a finite period of time and it's slightly depressing. I'm really missing a glass of wine these days...Anybody else have experience with this at this point in your sobriety? Why now?

I am not there but I read here every day and have several similar posts from people approaching one year. I hope you hear from one of them. It appears most get through it maybe they'll have something useful to share. 
People with more sobriety myself have also pointed out that at annual periods cravings appear. Based on your day count it also appears that this is your first Christmas/New Year Sober. Hang in there.
It seems like it just rears it's ugly head every once in a while.  Stress brings mine out.
Soberversaries are major triggers!  It's like the demon starts lying with crap like "You got a year under your belt surely you must be 'cured'."  I've seen it a lot here when people get to 7-9 months; it's very common.  Keep doing what you're doing!  Most people report feeling fine right after their first year.  Blessings to You!
