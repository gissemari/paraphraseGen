I made it a whole fucking week. Only got about 3 hours sleep last night but somehow woke feeling energised. A massive thank you to every single one of you here who is struggling daily and helping others on the path . A massive thank you to those who sent messages of support and helped me to where I am. Would not be here without this subreddit. Have a great Friday everyone. IO :-)

Nice!  Keep it up!
Seven days is tough - Go Irish!
Nice job! One week is great. Let's keep this thing going!
Congratulations on your first seven! Those first few days are so bloody hard some days I have to go hour by hour just so that I can get my arse to bed sober! You've got a great foundation to build upon. I know what you mean about this sub. It's a safe space here with loads of caring people who actually get how I'm feeling. Saved my life for sure! Take care and positive vibes to you IO :)
One week is great! But I may be biased :)
Big congrats one week is a huge milestone!
Living in Ireland and not drinking is very hard particularly with the nice weather at the moment. I've been telling my friends I am detoxing don't know how that will go down at a festival though! Keep it up random internet stranger!
You. FUCKING. ROCK.
