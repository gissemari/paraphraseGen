Good Morning/Afternoon!..*Theme:* Inspirational..**"Life begins at the end of your comfort zone." - [Neale Donald Walsch](http://www.values.com/inspirational-quotes/7341-life-begins-at-the-end-of-your-comfort-zone)**..*What I get from it:*  GOD I have been so so so [uncomfortable in sobriety.](http://i0.wp.com/www.dailyinspirationalquotes.in/wp-content/kapson_uploads/daily_quote_images/2014/31-10-2014-00-Inspiring-Quotes.jpg)  I have had to do things I don't want to do and talk about things I would rather not talk about and even think about things I tried my very best to forget.  I have had to fight through cravings and go to bed when I wasn't tired and have left parties via the [Irish Goodbye](http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-01/24/11/imagebuzz/webdr07/anigif_optimized-21414-1422116081-7.gif) and stayed home "sick" instead of going to a restaurant and I have had to ask for help and open up to people and UGH.  Point is I have been a lot more uncomfortable in sobriety than I was while drinking.  Sure the hangovers and crippling anxiety and shame sucked but I was always able to use and drink my way out of that after the discomfort got to be too much to bear. But like many aspects of sobriety after a few months I came to realize that [the discomfort was helping me](https://leadershipfreak.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/mouse-trap.jpg) to grow and that personal growth was what I wanted.  Once I was OK with not drinking anymore I became really interested in LIVING UP to my full potential and growing mentally and spiritually as a sober person.  So as much as I don't want to "do the due" sometimes I know for me it's always the better choice.  It's the healthier choice. The end game shows me that it is the HAPPIER choice.  So I sit in that discomfort take a deep breath [and dive into it.](https://amyjalapeno.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/pain-bliss-struggle-purpose-amyjalapeno.png?w=610&h=471)  Because from Day One what I have wanted is to [get better.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5osPtE7kXI)  ..Have an awesome day all!
----------immediate responses--------

I have been hiding in my comfort zone. I go to work I come home I go to two meetings a week. That's it. There is a voice in the back of my head that keeps telling me to plan for bigger and better. A nagging that says I can do more than I am doing (no it's not my wife :) - and I need to listen to that voice more. My fear is that if I push for more that the pressure and stress that I use to cover up with booze will cause me more pain and discomfort than I can/want to bear. Not that it will cause me to drink but that my response will be anger failure or embarrassment. Being sober and conscious of my shortcomings is a daily discomfort. Pushing beyond them takes courage and persistence. Today I hope I can be uncomfortable enough to have both. Happy Saturday!
