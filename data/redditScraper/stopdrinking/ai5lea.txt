Holllllly shit ya'll. ONE WEEK. If you had told me a week ago that I would go a week without drinking I would have told you you were insane. Checking in on SD every day has really helped me pull through and I am just blown away by how different I feel in this moment than I did one week ago. ..This week I went to the gym 4 times! I woke up yesterday morning fresh and hit the gym before the sun was fully up! I managed my work stress through exercise cooking and reading. I don't have dry mouth headaches weird bloating and my self-loathing and anxiety has taken a back seat. I actually SLEEP; no more weird insomnia!  I'm so flipping proud of myself. Yesterday afternoon the craving hit me really badly and I started to question why I was doing this but I resisted and that meant I got to spend the night cooking and watching a movie with my husband instead of passing out early and feeling miserable. Right now I'm baking double chocolate chip banana bread because guess what? I can eat a piece of freaking double chocolate chip banana bread and not hate myself for the "extra calories" that I used to reserve for drinking. ...When I was drinking I thought that I had no time. I thought that the only was I could reset and destress was with a beer in my hand...I have found so much more fulfillment and joy this week more than I ever thought was possible. I can't thank you all enough for sharing your stories struggles and triumphs. Reading your posts kept me motivated this week and I can't imagine going back to how I used to be. I will not drinking with you today you wonderful brave amazing people. Thank you &lt;3
