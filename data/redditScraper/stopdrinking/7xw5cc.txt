*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*. .**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**. .I'm pledging myself to not drinking today and invite you to do the same.. .Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.. .It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours lets not drink alcohol!. .---..&gt; Believing in negative thoughts is the single greatest obstruction to success.   (Charles F. Glassman)..Today is the beginning of the weekend and a lot of people seem to struggle with the weekend.  I believe that we struggle in part because we have pre-existing negative thoughts - "I'm going to screw up eventually so why not just give up now" is a common one for me.  ..Cognitive behavioural therapy suggests that we challenge unhealthy thoughts and beliefs.  ..Just because I have screwed up before doesn't mean I am going to again (I am not a rock and I can change).  ..I don't drink for the taste (no one has it innately it's a poison and our body rejects it initially)...Alcohol doesn't give me courage (I drank out of cowardice) it doesn't relieve stress or anxiety (if you're here it's created a ton of stress and anxiety for you) it doesn't make you happy you don't need it for a social life you don't need it to fit in...  ..Any of the excuses you might feed yourself today/this weekend for drinking are bullshit.  Read all that again: Friday is no good reason because we have no good reason...---..It has been my absolute privilege to post these messages every day as answering them has really helped me in the past.  Every person pledging has come through as a reminder to me that I am *not* alone and in fact have 100000 people on my side.  It's been insanely positive for my sobriety.  *Want what I've had and also have mad quote game?*  **You can volunteer to host next week!**  Message me for details...---. .**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!. .What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up.. .**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.. .**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.. .---. .This post goes up at:. .    US - Night/Early Morning  .    Europe - Morning  .    Asia and Australia - Evening/Night..A link to the current Daily Check-In post  can always be found near the top of the sidebar...---

I will not drink with you today 
Today I am thinking about how I need to remember my sobriety has value and like anything valuable it needs to be guarded. Anything in my life even things of great value can become taken for granted left to fall into disrepair if don't remember their value. Take a look at my car for a reminder of this. :-)..Today I am sober and I cherish these 6 weeks I have built up. IWNDWYT.

Fridays are super hard for me and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't nervous about after work today. ..I have a long note on my phone about why I don't want to drink and the consequences of taking that first one to help me.Play the tape through. I have this sub and the chat. I really hope that's enough...IWNDWYT.
I will not drink today!
Today is the first day I feel good. I'm on day 6 and had although still broken the best nights sleep in a long time. I feel fresh alert HUNGRY (08:15?!) and ready to face the day. Tonight will be the biggest test of the week being Friday but I'm confident I can get through it.

I will not drink today
IWNDWYT. Today will be a challenge as my boozy family arrive for the weekend and this is first time I won't be joining in. Feeling strong and armed with alternative soft drinks and sound bite explanations/retorts...wish me luck I grew up in piss artistry land and this is a new adventure. 
The wife is working a double today so it's just me and the kids so I will definitely not be drinking with any of you today!  Instead it's going to be a nice little dinner with my girls and maybe Shrek the movie for dessert donkey always puts me in a good mood.  Happy Friday all!

I will not drink today no matter what happens good or bad. Getting more test results for my wife and things haven't been good. Lizard brain says if it goes this way I drink. If it goes that way well...drink. Trying to replace that with regardless of how it goes I'll count our blessings and do something healthy like a walk.  Sober on SD'ers!

Should also have a pretty relaxing weekend ahead and we have my stepkid for the next ten days - I'm excited to spend time with him and watch him and our pupper run around like nutballs for the next ten days! 
I will not drink today!.
Checking in IWNDWYT SD.  
I texted my estranged sister yesterday to wish her and her family well. I would never had done that while using alcohol. By doing that I have a sense of peace and letting go of that suffering which has been with me for a decade. Today I'm greatful for my sobriety

I will not drink on this soggy Friday. The foot of snow has melted and it's a world of mush out there. Son is home sick and since I have a ton of sick days I took the day off. Slept in and heading to the pool shortly. Then it's movies and laundry the rest of the day!.
Boyfriend is on his second out-of-state interview. My anxiety is high. I have rallied a friend for some yoga and ice cream tonight. I will not drink.
I will not drink today!

Happy Friday Sober People slept in today cause I am off today for a 4 day weekend and four and a half weeks ago this would have been a four day drink fest but not today. The sun is shining and yes birds are singing going to be a good day and no drinking with you lot. Peace
Today is my birthday and I will not be drinking.
Haven't been sleeping well these last two nights (I may be overdoing the caffeine in the evening thanks work) but still woke up feeling great. Everyone have a awesome Friday! ..IWNDWYT 
Not today! Day 25 sans badge.
Reset.  Slipped last night. Almost had two weeks under my belt.  The warm weather and being outdoors with a friend led to beer.  I obviously need to remember sober people sober placesas well as add some tools to my plan.  Thanks for being here guys.    IWNDWYT
I know what the right answers are at least I know what they are for me. My girlfriend always tells me how I know what the right thing to do is I just have to do it. I'm tired of sinning my wheels. It's time to do what I know is right. One day at a time: I will not drink with you today!
No drinking for me today
I'm here and present.  Feeling a happy medium.  A "meh" day is a good thing when compared to being hungover and full of self-loathing.  I will not drink with you today.
I'm in a great mood right now which is a nice change of pace from the beginning of this week. I will not drink with y'all today!
Not drinking today!
No drinking for me today.

Not drinking today or the next 24hrs.
I will not drink with you today my friends!   
I will not be drinking today 
This naked username-- checking in flairless! Busy week lots of ups and downs. Feel great to be sober. Tomorrow is boyfriend's birthday and he is still drinking. I will not drink with him this weekend though. He knows my sobriety is important and won't pressure me. I'm pretty sure he's proud of me in fact and I can see he's been cutting back at least. ..I will not drink with you today.
I did not drink yesterday and I will not drink today.
Good morning SD.  I won't drink with you all today.
Good morning.  Not drinking today.
I will not drink with you all today. I'm going to work on my endless project getting today's work done. I'm going to knock an annoying item off my to do list. I'm going to clean my car. Tonight I will relax with a nice meal and then maybe a video game. 
I will not drink with you today
I will not drink today.
Apparently the Badge Bot broke. But believe me I still know I'm at Day 698. And counting. Every. Single. Day.
IWNDWYT!
I will not drink with you today!
I will not drink today!
Wow late check in today but I will not drink with all you lovely people today ... to busy doing other productive things!!
Went to sleep at 1am woke up at 7am. I'm continually amazed at how much less sleep I need since I stopped drinking. ..Now to get off Reddit and out of bed.....IWNDWYT
The Badge Bot may be AWOL but I'm at 95 days &amp; counting. IWNDWYT
None for me today.
Checking in!! Looking forward to a three day weekend. I am super excited to not drink with you today!!  
I will not drink today. 
No drinks
this morning i had a nice moment of gratitude for life's blessing. because i am so busy at work and often stressed i get overwhelmed but that is mainly due to the stress i place on myself. i get annoyed by the busy bus and city but i fail to pause to realize how much i love my city and how grateful i am that the bus gets me where i need to go. the weather will not be as bad this weekend so i am hoping to get out and explore. ..i will not drink with you today. 
I will not drink today!
I will not drink with you today.
Happy Friday! I will not drink with you today!
Fridays are hard - they used to be a night that I'd go out and binge. No longer - my doctor told me that I cannot. Ready for whatever Friday night brings to me that isn't booze!..May the 2 weeks not be broken. IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT
I most certainly without a doubt will not drink with you today.  
Broke my streak of losing weight every day. But I can't minimize the positive: I've been working out more and more every day. I guess what I'm saying is I won't use that or anything else as a reason to drink today.
I'm so excited to be on day 9. No intentions to drink today! However I'm not looking forward to seeing my psychotherapist today. i haven't seen him in two weeks (since my last bender) and I really don't want to talk about it. Of course in past experiences I say the same thing and once I get on that couch it's word vomit...Regardless of how it goes I will not drink with you today.
Last day at my old job and am 100% sober exactly how I'm wanting to go out. I will not drink with you today!
Checkn em
I will not drink alcohol today no matter how much pain I'm in.
Checking in. I will not drink with you today. I don't miss it. Life is much more fulfilling.
Came to check in and got so caught up in the comments and missing badge that I forgot to post! IWNDWYT
i will not drink with you today!

I will not drink today!
Not today.
I will not drink today 
Happy Friday!!  Guess what I will not be doing today?!  IWNDWYT 
Check-in for today. Got my labs back from the doc with a decent bill of health. There are improvements needed but it is early yet. Remaining hopeful and do not have the urge to drink. 
Howdy! I forgot to check in this am...so here I am...IWNDWYT 
I will not drink today. 
Badges? Badges? We don't need no stinking badges....of course i just popped in to 'see' mine. Oh well IWNDWYT. 
Another weekend ahead of me. Another sober one. A new love of life. IWNDWYT
Late to the party but I went to my second AA meeting in two days. Got my 24 hour chip. Feeling just a little better about it all. ..IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT 
Checking in this Friday evening. I will not drink with you today   
This has been the most emotionally draining day since I got sober this time but I will NOT drink with you today. &lt;3
I will not drink with you today. Which is new for me on a Friday night but I will not!
I will not drink today.
Not drinking tonight!!  It feels good completing to do lists and having a clear mind. 
IWNDWYT 
A good evening to everyone. I shall not drink with you tonight.
Today has been my first day sober in a long time. With the weekend here I am fearful of what decisions I will make so I've decided to work over the weekend. I may just make weekend work the new norm to keep myself busy at all times. ..I will not drink with you today.
The day is not over! Still not today!
