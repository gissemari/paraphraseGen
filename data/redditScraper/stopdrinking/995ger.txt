I'm getting so tired of this . Really I am. I had another relapse dream last night. This time in the dream I was at like an event on a boat and someone handed me a drink they had made but everyone was drinking it it was like blue and I thought it was non alcoholic . There was vodka in it . I could taste it as soon as I took the first sip. Then I thought to myself well I guess that's it 4 months for nothin I have done myself in and then I drank the whole drink... logged into my sobriety app and clicked start over. ..It literally feels right now as if that all really happened and I feel so guilty and I hate myself really. I feel some relief knowing it was just a dream but man it sucks to wake up like this.

A couple days ago I had a dream where I was drinking too and it's so weird to me how the dream versions of ourselves know they aren't supposed to be doing that and how we feel guilt over something that didn't happen. You can't control dream you but you can control your actions today :)
