I never thought of myself as an alcoholic. In fact I never really got into drinking until I turned twenty one. I was the sober friend who drove all of my other friends to parties while they illegally imbibed. I liked knowing that I was keeping everyone else safe even if I felt like a total buzzkill. I never liked to lose control but I started to indulge more as my life started to change.  ...I will save you the pain that I went through during and post twenty one which resulted in my binge drinking but I think it is important that I share some very important moments during my years of catastrophic drinking.  ...* I once was pulled over by an officer on my way home from the bars with my friend. I passed the sobriety tests (miraculously) and blew just under a .08. I was let off the hook which gave me a false sense of accomplishment. If I could fool them I was invincible. .* I later blacked out at a Christmas party and decided to drive home. I crashed into not one but three parked cars and luckily my brother was with me (and sober) to take the hit. Again the universe decided to let me off of the hook. .* The following Summer I attended a pride festival with some friends. I blacked out (per usual) and ended up being assaulted by two men. This was one of the worst days of my life..* Most recently I blacked out at a work Christmas party. I am unsure of anything that happened here but I do know that I lost my keys and broke down my own front door.  ...Needless to say I am only a few days sober but I am never going back again. The only serious problems I have ever experienced in my life have all been tied to drinking. Considering all of the above my life is actually at a good place and I do not want to risk losing any of that. I want to be a good and happy person. I love being outside I love my friends and I love my family. I love dogs yoga morning coffee and the movies. There are millions of things I love that could be taken away from me over something so insignificant. I wanted to write this so that I could remind myself of the major things that have hurt me and why I am choosing to live without their cause: alcohol.  ...I don't know if this story helps but I find that it's sometimes beneficial to see that someone else is struggling with the same type of problem. Luckily I have hope and I know that I can cut this out of my life. I know you can too.
