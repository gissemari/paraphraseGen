I've been looking for this subredddit for awhile now! I'm happy to join a community who can help me with this addiction I've been battling with for 8 years strong. As a native and growing up in a family that is very open to substance abuse I've struggled a lot. Recently last Sunday I decided enough was enough and put the shot glass/beer bottles down. It was probably the best decision of my life coming in on two weeks now  I feel great! I'm thinking more clearly and have been working on getting other things in order. I think the hardest part is rediscovering my passions that didn't involve alcohol before this became my second me and I must say it's hard! Drinking has been a huge issue with me and fianc  she has been my life stone that has kept me grounded and seen me at my worse and seen me on the tipping point of quitting but This is it! Semi-cold turkey and the love of my future wife has made me turn my wheel to a brighter road without alcohol! Thanks.

Welcome!..I would say don't feel too pressured to fill the void too quickly. When I look back over the course of this year it didn't take long for other passions to come back and for me to find new ones too...I will not drink with you today.
Congrats!  You should get a flair.  Show off that 14 days with pride!
