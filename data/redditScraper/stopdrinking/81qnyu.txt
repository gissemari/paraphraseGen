So it's Saturday morning and I just have to say I feel fantastic! I was so tempted to relapse last night but I thought about how I would feel this morning and I held out. Well now I'm up 2 hours earlier than I usually would be and I feel great. Now I can actually be productive today maybe clean the house maybe work out a bit instead of sleeping all day and popping Advil.

Good for you! Amazing how productive a sober Saturday can be without much effort either. Have a great weekend!
