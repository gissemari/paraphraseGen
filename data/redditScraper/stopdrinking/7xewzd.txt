62 days sober. It doesn't help my mind wandering during meetings but it fits me better than drinking. What does help is high intensity training. And just knowing that with each day of not drinking my mind and memory are getting better...I also struggle with attention problems and always have. Mainly I don't learn or retain a lot from a lecture. Never have. I learn by doing things.  My alcohol abuse made this way worse. So I am gauging how the improvement will be since I read after 60 days your brain really starts recovering...My memory also took a big hit. I am excited to get this back to where it was. Once I learned something like playing a song I used to hold onto it. Can't wait to be there again...My plan is to not drink and add in high intensity training and a healthy diet. I feel that is the best therapy for full recovery.

&gt; My plan is to not drink and add in high intensity training and a healthy diet...Exercise especially high intensity really improves the mood (at least for a while after the exercise) and good moods prevent relapse.
Congrats on 62 days. I find HIIT has been a huge help especially in the beginning and having consistent workout habits help move the days along. Now it's a part of my day I look forward to as much as maybe more than I did drinking! Wishing you the best in your recovery.
