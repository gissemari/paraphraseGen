So tonight I am officially two weeks sober and pretty proud of myself especially when the last several years I couldn't make it two days I owe a big thanks to SD so thank you all. The last couple weeks have been a lot of ups and downs and mental struggles as I'm sure there are more to come. Today a coworker said I was being to serious and that I should drink more. Haha. I spent the next several hours telling myself that I should just get a small bottle of vodka but ultimately I came home from work changed and went to the gym came home and had a glass of chocolate milk and a sparkling water later in the evening. For the first time in a long time I'm winning the battles against my inhibitions. Thanks for reading!
