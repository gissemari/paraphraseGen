I have checked my calendar three times now to make sure it was actually Wednesday already. HAPPY HUMP-DE-DUMP DAY! ..Share your triumphs struggles and general nonsense! ..---..**Triumph:** Start HRT next Friday the 13th. Labs all came back clean. Work is solid no problems. Gizmo is a goofball. I move into a really good supportive household in June and the anticipation kills. ..**Struggle:** PTSD. ..**General Nonsense:** What is your favourite quirk about yourself?     ..Mine: I have a jean jacket that is loaded with patches from various punk rock bands. ..
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph: Start a new job and a path to a new career at the end of the month at a very reputable institution.  Have a good job now but this time I will be doing what I love.  I am 25 and feel I am getting this figured out at a good time in my life...Struggle: Boredom.  I am early in my sobriety and struggle with my free time as I used to just spend it drinking with buddies.  Being a young professional most of the things my friends want to do involve drinking and I'm not ready to  be around that so early in my sobriety yet.  So far I have been exercising eating lots of good food and watching netflix/playing video games.  I am searching for a more fulfilling hobby though...General Nonsense: I have a Spotify playlist entitled "Man Music" which is basically just super manly songs I blast in my house when my girlfriend isn't around.  There are some pretty ridiculous songs on there.  Current favorite track on it is "I'm a Man" by Spencer Davis group.
Triumph: I'm rediscovering my personality and hobbies without alcohol. I'm almost 25 and I've been drinking heavily since I was 17. I'm looking forward to gardening cooking sewing and crafting and drawing this summer. I also plan to continue running every other day....Bonus Triumph: When I had my breakdown and epic drinking binge about 5 weeks ago I stopped going to both of my classes. This semester was my first back at community college and it's very important to me that I finish school. I missed about 7 school days... I was ready to just withdraw and give up like I have tons of times before but with the encouragement of my boyfriend and my newfound sobriety I contacted both professors and was allowed to finish one class. Today is my last class for the semester and I'll find out my grade May 18th....Struggle: I'm struggling financially and am worried that I'm going to have to find a different job soon. I've been at my current job for two years and am very comfortable there but it's commission-based and my checks have been horribly insufficient lately...No matter what happens drinking won't help...General Nonsense: Almost forgot to answer lol. My favorite quirk about myself is the songs I come up with for my cats. They're really just versions of other songs. My favorite is "Pretty Kitty" which is based on "Pretty Woman". :)
**Triumph:** It's SPRING! One of the two or three most glorious months where I live and I'm enjoying it thoroughly...**Struggle:** I'm getting closer to maintaining equanimity. When I lose it I have to be careful not to let my self-disappointment feed into the loop and make it worse...**Nonsense:** Whoa I'm struggling with this one... I like to cook and enjoy sharing flavorful and nutritious food with friends and acquaintances.
Triumph: Two days sober.  ..Struggle: Sleeping. Between the dreams (yep had my first dream about drinking last night) and the general difficulty I have even getting to sleep it's been tough at night.  ..General Nonsense: I can throw down dad jokes with the best of them.

**Triumph:** Was hired yesterday to teach an upcoming class at our local community college. And not a fluff class either: I will be training prospective home inspectors in a state-certified class to prepare them for the national exam!..**Struggle:** Business is slow in what should be our busy season. Trying to figure out why and answers are not coming. It's scary to have to dip into savings to pay the bills...**General Nonsense:** I have tons of quirks. One of them is my fondness for Dutch licorice; the salty kind. 
**TRIUMPH** ..Went to dinner --&gt; bar with my boyfriend and his brother. My poor boyfriend got sucked into the alcoholic destruction that is his Brother. Poor guy had to be about carried home. I on the other hand sipped Soda water all night with no inclination to drink whatsoever.   ...**STRUGGLE**..I'm not looking forward to this Sunday. We're going to my boyfriend's mothers. She's..God I dont know.  He says she's an alcoholic but I never see her drink more than one (ok large) glass of cheap white wine. He replies that that's only what I SEE her drink. Touche. Anyway. Between his mom and step dad and brother who'll all be there it'll be a booze fest and no one'll understand me not drinking. Not worried I will mind you just not looking forward to the fucking inquisition. I wish I were pregnant so people'd leave me alone on it for 9 months.  ...**NONSENSE** ..I'm knitting a pair of socks patterned in [middle fingers]( .http://imgur.com/A6Z3rcN) and it just fucking tickles me. 
Haven't checked in for a while but not drinking today! Wishing you all the best. xo
**Triumph**..I've been sober for over a week including a weekend. I successfully fended off cravings last night. Small wins to be sure but I'll take what I can get...**Struggle**..Guilt and boredom. I'm getting back into things I used to enjoy but the guilt for my actions while drunk is hard. The therapist I'm seeing has said I need to start actually accepting and processing these feelings instead of burying them and it's hard. I'm not used to really feeling emotions...**Nonsense**..I am really enjoying the mobile game Neko Atsume. It's unbelievably silly but I keep 'playing' it.
**Triumph:** I'm wearing a pretty dress. sometimes that's all I got :)   ..**Struggle:** I feel paralyzed by a Very Huge Thing that I keep putting off. it's really personal and I'm not ready to discuss it here yet. let's just say time is of the essence like my actual life depends on it and I've been procrastinating for years by drinking the worries away. now that I have to *take action* I'm totally freaking out. I don't know how to do this sober. (actually: writing this helps me realize that I need to ask my doctors for more support. just like everything else I don't need to do this alone. thanks SD.)..**General Nonsense:** when I laugh really hard I snort and my left eye squints. it's ridiculous! 
**Triumph:** Emotional committed to sobriety..**Struggle:** Breaking the weekend pattern. I'm extremely nervous of this upcoming weekend. My plan is to hang out in the chat and lean on SD for support. Hope it works! :)..**General Nonsense:** Spent over $1200 in the last 2 months on alcohol or alcohol related nonsense. Definitely looking forward to putting this money to other uses!
Triumph: went climbing and did a decent set of bodyweight stuff too after 25 weeks of complete physical inactivity :) feeling good!..Struggle: work social situations general anxiety sleep mood swings..General nonsense: I wonder which book (unrelated to addictions) to read haven't really read any fiction in a looong while..
Triumph: I worked productively on a new client at work..Struggle: I would love to drink a glass of Chateauneuf du pape without wanting to drink two bottles of gutrot corner shop 'Red' afterwards..General nonsense: I have far too much fun singing and dancing in the car by myself.
**Triumph:**House purchase that only could've happened because I stopped drinking!..**Struggle:**OMG how am I going to pay for all of the little things that need fixing?!..**Nonsense:**I can be pretty silly and playful and I am not embarrassed in the least by this even when I get the eye roll from some folks.
Just wanted to check in and say hello. First post on this reddit. ..Triumph: Sober 9 days...again...Struggle: Saying sober and out of the general fear and loathing that drives me to drink...General Nonsense: I own a big fluffy ass cat that follows me around the house. I'm a grown man :-) .
Triumph -- my depression has lifted after 3+ years..Struggle -- Sleep.  Always.  Chronic insomnia not improved by sobriety...General Nonsense: Had the opportunity to spend time with my son who goes to school 1100 miles away.  Saw him pitch live for the first time on his college team.
Triumph: Restarting sobriety and zero cravings right now...Struggle: Feelings of self-loathing and shame directed at my last blackout drunk...Random Quirk: I love fantasy RPGs Witcher 3 is awesome for those of you looking for a good video game to play.
Triumph: I feel like my trombone playing is getting back to where I'm reasonably happy with it after a bit of a lay off earlier in the year...Struggle: A couple of work issues slowing me down a bit because I hadn't put effective barriers to them in place a while ago. Last year this sort of thing would have led me to drink. But not now...General nonsense: I have to sing &amp; alter pretty much all music that is on the telly on a regular basis. It drives the SO mad...
**Triumph:** 27 days clean great days at work lost a pound and a half cut down on my anxiety medication...**Struggle:** Hunger and mild heartache over a guy who I can't have. ..**General Nonsense:** I eat yogurt with a fork. 
Triumph: coming up on three weeks thinking about drinking is becoming less of a habit loop/compulsion...Struggle: ...on that note trying not to get "complacent" and fall down with "just one drink" or totally forget why I decided to stop in the first place. Keeping my cost-benefit analysis handy. Have a busy/stressful week culminating in a large-ish event and have to re-up on all the tools I've used to stay sober thus far...General Nonsense: If someone is humming or singing a song to themselves I always join in. Even if it's total nonsense I'll just start riffing on it because why not?
I won't drink today
Triumph: One month left of the school year left before summer break starts for this teacher!..Struggle: I never have enough money for all the toys/lifestyle I want! ..General nonsense: My favorite quirk...I have a very self-depreciating sense of humor but I really am OK with myself and like my humor.
Triumph: celebrated two months of sobriety on Monday...Struggle:I'm trying to get my husband a green card so we can move to the US. We got a temporary rejection at the interview. The officer said we need to provide new tax statements from 2015 from my co-sponsor and I. I'm getting everything sent to me now but filing overseas freaks me out because I haven't done it well. I'm not adulting correctly :/...Nonsense: I blazed through about 10 cans of Schweppes soda water the day we got our rejection cleaning half of the bottom of my fridge. I REALLY wanted to drink and pounded soda water instead.
