I made the best decision of my whole life. I am truly grateful...I would never have thought that I would have come so far and how great my life has become. ..For those of you struggling...I got sober this long just 1 day at a time. You can do it too. It has truly been worth it...Edit: WOW Thanks for all the well wishes it is people like you that keep me sober... many thanks

So Happy for youthanks for being here for us.
Congratulations!..How has your opinion of yourself changed since you quit?  ..Did you ever stop being terrified of relapsing and if so when and how?  ..At what point did you start to feel better - way better?  ..What was your biggest difficulty in recovery?
