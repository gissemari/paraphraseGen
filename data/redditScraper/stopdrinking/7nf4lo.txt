Made a lovely curry and played crash bandicoot. Feel a bit crap that my boyfriend feels he can't ever drink around me again though I even asked him if he wanted drinks as the very last time before I start a clean slate with the new year but I played the tape forwards and I'm sober didn't drink a drop last night.  Even though I'm struggling with how 'normal' it is to drink to celebrate or whatever excuse can be used. There's still parts of me that think I'm being boring for not drinking..... Thanks society for making it such a big thing to drink alcohol. Idiots.

I can speak from experience (I was sober for 10 years at one point) you will eventually see that most people really don't care if you drink or not.  Sometimes they don't even notice you are not drinking even though you may feel you are wearing a neon sign that says "look at me I'm the one who's not drinking alcohol!".  Right now it feels like a big deal but eventually it won't define you so much as just be a part of who you are.  I will not drink with you today and I am grateful to be sober today.
Mine was quiet as well. I liked it.
Hi! Good morning! I'd rather be boring and happy than drunk and miserable! I also want to hug your boyfriend! Happy new year purple!
Happy new year purplehaze!!! .We made it!     .I'm happy you didn't drink last night and I'm happy not to be drinking with you today too!
Quiet here too and it was nice. Book recommendation: This Naked Mind. A lot of interesting stuff about how society conditions us to relate alcohol with being/having fun. Something I still grapple with!.
