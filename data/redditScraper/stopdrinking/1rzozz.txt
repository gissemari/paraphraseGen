Today is my second first year. I don't count my sober time collectively as in "I have 3.5 years with a relapse" No - today it has been one year since my last drink. But I don't like to ignore my previous time sober either...For me that time is an important time period. It helps make my sobriety stronger today. On March 1 2008 I hit my first rock bottom.. And fortunately I managed not to injure or kill anyone else or myself or have any legal trouble. But even without those things I had nowhere left to go. I spent 2.5 years sober and it actually went well and life was improving. ..After those 2.5 years I began to get envious of those who could drink normally. (Funny I didn't start off that way I guess I was charged up about my new way of living.) A lot of things in my life had shifted dramatically and I spent a long time considering whether or not I was really an alcoholic and my brain convinced me I could make moderation work that I wasn't really an alcoholic that I had merely been *abusing* alcohol before. I was happier now I was in a different place. Little did I realize that my depression had been aggravated by my drinking not my drinking aggravated by my depression. Armed with a list of "rules" for how to make it work (looking back this is such a huge red flag that I'm not a normal drinker but how many of us have tried "the rules"?) I made a calculated decision to try drinking again. I guess they call it a relapse but I always thought a relapse was more of an accidental and emotional return to drinking but I am realizing more and more each day that **I am not special**...I spent 2.5 years trying to make it work but it didn't take long to return to my bad drinking habits. I still managed to stay out of trouble but it wasn't long before I was right back to where I left off...To make a long story short I realized after a particularly bad blackout that I really am indeed an alcoholic. Now I don't feel comfortable recommending the path I took (drinking again). But my story is that having tried it I can now confirm that Yes I am an alcoholic and No I can't make moderation work. Those questions used to nag me and they don't any longer. Another reason a previous time of sobriety helps me is that I wasn't afraid of sober life because I knew what to expect. I knew i could have fun sober as I'd done it before. It has made the second go around a world easier for me. I realize that drinking for me simply isn't an option. I am someone who just doesn't drink...I am thankful to be here today to recognize another first year of a new way of living. Thanks for reading.

Thank you for expressing your experience strength and hope. We are all better for it.
Outstanding!  I really appreciate your post full of solid insight thanks for sharing.  Many happy returns.
Thanks for posting.  I think sobriety will only work for people who believe they are alcoholics.  Sometimes the rock bottom convinces them other times it's realizing that moderation doesn't work for them.  I'm glad you figured that out without any really bad things happening!
Congrats!
&gt;I am realizing more and more each day that **I am not special.**..exactly.
Thanks for doing the field work! I am lucky in that my experimentation with moderation lasted about a month and was as boring desolate and soul-deadening as all of my drinking had become. ..Keep up the great work.  
Congratulations on your second first year! That's awesome!..This is an awesome story and very much inspirational. Thank you for sharing it.
Very similar path myself OP; what is different for me now is that I know deeply I am alcoholic and can never safely or without severe mental fuckery drink again; I go to meetings and try and fill my life with healthy habits..Thank you for posting :)
Thank you for sharing and happy second first year.  
Congrats. Thanks for sharing! When I realized that my problem with alcohol was moderation it made it much easier as well. I can't not have that 4th or 24th drink I don't have the self control for that once I'm intoxicated...But I can not have that 1st one...I love this sub. Truly a nonjudgmental place where you can meet tons of people in all stages of recovery around the world 24/7/365. The most amazing thing though is how "not special" and similar we all are...Keep up the inspiration I hope to hit a year in 10 months but hope I'm always still 10 months behind you!
What a great example of the kind of thinking that occurs in alcoholics. A problem drinker becomes convinced he is not an alcoholic so what does he decide to do about it? Drink of course...It's something I've had to say to a few friends before "If you don't have a drinking problem not drinking shouldn't be a problem for you."
congrats on finding your way back. i know how hard it can be to recover from a relapse. and congrats on another year of sobriety!!
Thanks for this! Since trying to sober up forever ten years ago I have:.90 days dry .9 months drunk .1.5 years dry .5 years drunk .2.75 years dry .1 year drunk really really drunk .2 months dry... and now today dry. I'll make it today...I have lots of rock bottoms and every time I tried to quit I meant it 100%. I've finally FINALLY come to terms with one day at a time. Before it was never enough. But now it's the only way for me.
Congratulations!  What a gift for you to be able to come back to sobriety with such clarity and to be able to share that with others.  Thank you!

thank you for this awesome post.  congrats on your sobriety.  
Congrats. I had to do a bit of research myself to convince myself I was sober.  I would not recommend it either.  It nearly killed me.  Today I am just me and don't live in a fantasy world.
