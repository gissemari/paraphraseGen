Some random thoughts I wrote in my journal that I wanted to share with you guys because well this sub helps me a great deal and while I'm still learning the ropes maybe this post will help someone at least  in a little way..	.1. Whenever I am about to drink I KNOW I am about to drink and STILL act accordingly. That has to change I CAN control myself..2. It is more than alcohol - you can act compulsive even towards reading while it is way healthier I still go on it in excess so there are deeper issues that have to be worked through.3. I always drank in some sort of illusion that I will meet someone that I will experience something out-worldly strike upon a great life altering realization  but it is nothing more than daydreaming. While I had my share of great experiences I am quite sure now that the cost and result ratio does not match. Only around one in ten benders result in something good in my life and even then my self-destructive behavior finds ways to mess it up. It is a classic example of not following my own experience that shows how drinking does not help me but actually systematically destroy me while I still hang on to hope that it somehow could help me better my life. I think media portrayal of alcohol helped me to create such unrealistic expectations. .4. I am afraid that life without substance abuse is somehow isolated but experience shows me how I feel way better sober in all aspects of my life. Somehow I still have this clinging feeling that I am missing out..5. All in all I think all self-abusive behavior is a set of actions that follow false beliefs. Those false beliefs are the ones that should be attacked head first and probably even relapses can be helpful in that way. For example yesterday I played my childhood computer game AGAIN for few hours and well.. I felt like shit afterwards. It wasn't fun or in any way interesting. Just a bad nostalgia trip some things are better left in memories and shouldn't be ones to try again. How do we call people wo do things again and again while expecting different results? That's right. Idiots...

Isn't it the definition of insanity? Doing the same thing over and over
