Life is still difficult at times. I've spent some of those years neglecting my recovery to the point where I probably am beyond lucky I didn't start drinking again. ..I'm going through some extremely tough times to do with a relationship right now. We're both long term in recovery but for some reason cannot behave ourselves when we're together. It's frustrating because we love each other very deeply yet struggle during conflict to even act like adults. I'm hurt and scared but I know it will be okay because I have people who care near me in these rooms. ..Only offering I have don't glide through recovery. Actively pursue growth and reward through the program or you may pay for it in a similar way.

You are right on Joshuages.  I'm around your same recovery time and gliding at any stage newcomer or oldtimers or in between is dangerous territory. even though I am very accustomed to sobriety my thinking can get me pretty far into left field and it's scary howfast that can happen.  I am very glad you posted and are getting to a meeting for support.
Iam old but new at this. What do you both mean?
Relationships are sometimes the hardest thing. I hope both of you the best. Stay strong! :)
