I had a bit of a relapse Thursday night. I've been kicking ass at life the past almost two months. I hadn't missed class was actively keeping up with the material house was always clean etc. I was my true self no fog clear thoughts and words. A friend was cooking a fancy dinner and him and another close friend were having some wine. I romanticized the idea of a gourmet meal with some wine after all I was feeling great about myself and my success. Yeah you know how it ends. ..I only had one glass and we were out. So it's after dinner and I decide I'll go get us some beer just enough for 6 each. So it won't be a double digit night I tell myself I can drink responsibly. Six beers later it's a great night we're having great conversation but it's getting kind of late. My friend has to get up early but I don't want the party to be over. In fact that's the most valuable lesson I learned from it all. Drunk me cannot accept the party is over until I pass out from being so drunk. I go into toddler mode throwing a fit in my head that it's not fair I deserve this one evening. ..So I drunk drive to get another sixer (nice one bro). About 3 into it I'm in hysterics. I'm emotionally irreconcilable and i'm by myself. I lost my dad earlier this year so it's been tough times. Alcohol brings out all the pain and it's been this way the last many times I thought I could handle drinking. Lizard brain strikes again!
