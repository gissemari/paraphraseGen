Whilst dreaming last night which I love that I do regularly again I found myself waking from a dream within that dream that I had relapsed. No I thought I was simply dreaming. But I found it was true I had gotten blackout drunk and done some pretty horrible things to some very good friends. I was devastated. BUT NO! Everything was a dream and I woke up to my 18th day sober. Relapse nightmares may be the worst kind of nightmares because as an alcoholic it seems perfectly reasonable that I slipped up and blacked it all out. None of that absurdist stuff in normal nightmares. Just very plausible situations. Anyways sorry for the rambling. IWNDWYT!

I believe that dreams have meanings and the website dreammoods.com has the following to say:.."Recovering alcoholics often have dreams of drinking which results in feelings of guilt. Such dreams help to reinforce their sobriety."..http://dreammoods.com/cgibin/dreamdictionarymsearch.pl?method=exact&amp;header=dreamsymbol&amp;search=Alcohol
