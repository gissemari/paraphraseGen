How did I celebrate? I drank ice water all day and evening. I must have some kind of supersensitivity to dehydration because I can't remember a time in my adult life when I didn't "have a drink going." During the day it would be iced coffee; by evening it was whisky whiskey or wine. Occasional forays into something else at times both night and day but to quote what someone said is an Irish aphorism "They speak of my drinking but never my thirst."   .   .When I stopped drinking alcohol I knew I needed something with a bite to satisfy whatever Scotch or JD or rye did for my tastebuds so my go-to evening drink became soda water (seltzer) with diet tonic water. I still enjoy that sometimes anytime and that's still my order if I'm out with friends who are imbibing.   .   .The last couple years I've gone more to unsweetened iced green tea (we're talking nearly a 2 gallon pitcher a day) or 3-4 liters of diet soda. I still will drink iced coffee (black unsweetened) a few times a month.   .  .For Day 2000 though I somehow got it into my head that I would drink only iced water all day and evening which is refreshing in the summer but normally I'd "need" something with at least some flavor at some point. But today I forwent anything other than iced water even with my tasty home-grilled burger and spinach-Romano risotto I made us for dinner.   .  .Why just drink ice water all day and evening on my 2000th day since I last drank alcohol? It just seemed the perfect healthy way to mark the day   particularly because 2001 days ago I might have been able to for a day but I'd struggle especially as the day wore on trying focus on anything other than the alcohol I wasn't drinking. Today rather than be obsessed by the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH I can't safely have whenever I was thirsty I had to remind myself I was just having H<sub>2</sub>O today which made me smile.  .  .Sorry for the trite answer in advance but it's very true: How did I go 2000 days without alcohol? By taking life one day at a time.  .  .My every strong thought and prayer for everyone just stopping drinking and has come across this post. To answer the question in your head: Yes you can. Just today you can not drink. That's all I get too is a one-day reprieve. Those days just before you know it add up and can turn into thousands.
