To anyone struggling I can tell you that it isn't worth it. I drank and now I have to deal with cravings much worse now. You may miss drink but that's how this illness fools you. It makes you remember drinking in a better light than what it is. So please don't make the same mistake. Take it from someone who knows it will not be worth it. I have to fight now not to drink.

This is so true and scary:..&gt; It makes you remember drinking in a better light than what it is...For me this feels like the biggest danger right now.  I've been keeping a list of crappy things that resulted from my drinking to remind myself -- because if I don't do that I glamorize it.  Thank you for this reminder it helps me.
Thanks for sharing I won't drink with you today!
You've conducted some important research.  What did you learn that might help someone else?
Thank you for sharing and please take care of yourself. 
100% right Neptune. We can't go back. I've tried many many times and  always with the same horrible results. This is much better and feels amazing already even at 4 days. 
The past few times I drank and fucked up I wrote myself an email the morning after when my anxiety and regret was at its peak. They REALLY help me to stay sober when I'm tempted.  If you do slip up I highly suggest writing yourself an email detailing how you feel because it's hard to remember that when you're feeling shitty and thinking about drinking...Here's an except from my last email:.."I feel like I'm going to die.  I don't want to drink anymore if I can't prevent myself from blacking out.  I need to lose weight.  I hate who I am right now."..Hope this can help some of you out there.
