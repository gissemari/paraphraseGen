Hi All..I just wanted to introduce myself and say thank you to all those who have shared their struggles advice and encouragement via their comments and posts--ya'll have helped me quite a bit (I've been lurking :)..I (40 yo lady) decided I was done with drinking--really done--on Sunday night April 15 2018. This is the second longest I have been sober in 20+ years (yikes....). But I am and it feels great. Honestly I don't hate myself anymore and believe me I have been hating myself for decades. It's nice not to have to hate myself. I've over doing it. ..I know this time is different. Why? Because I NO LONGER WANT TO DRINK. Every time I went to quit before I was in a state of deprivation (white knuckles thinking that I would have to deprive myself of booze for the rest of my life. Now I am in a state of liberation (realizing that booze just sucks (the life out of me) and that I am free from it)--I am liberated. I am free. Hallelujah!..I came to the decision that booze was making me miserable of my own accord (hey 1/3 of peeps decide to spontaneously quit--I didn't know that was a thing until I turned into one of the quitters). But after I had decided that booze was doing nothing for me and in fact was responsible for making me miserable (anxiety depression 40 lbs attached to my once lithe body) I went in search of info to bolster my decision---and the Reddit rabbit hole led me here. I found resources that I didn't know about ("This Naked Mind" and "Alcohol Explained" (Thanks Woody!)) that bolstered my decision/resolve and further gave me information that allowed me to understand HOW I had arrived at a place of out of control drinking that I didn't want to be engaged in. I had not know prior the mechanisms (biochemical and subconscious programming) by which I found myself night after night engaging in drinking behavior that I did not want to engage in--thus leading to the cycle of self loathing followed by more drinking. Now that I have both Resolve + Understanding there is nothing that could convince me to go back to drinking. (If I'm not going to drink paint thinner then why drink booze?)..I'm not saying this has been 100% easy--It hasn't. The first few days I felt elated and then....a six day headache set in that zapped my energy. I'm still dealing with some physical withdrawals (I also kicked sugar at the same time so that may be exacerbating the symptoms--next up throwing out the cigarettes!) but they are toning down and I KNOW that at the end of this detox process I'm going to feel so much better (I've only lost 2 lbs but I figure that's a good start and it's all downscale from here :)..tl;dr: I am finally free of booze and I wanted to thank everyone here. IWNDWYT..xoxo..-J
