Life is beyond amazing I've travelled the world been to loads of music festivals gone back to school started a business ironically now I'm even investing a lot of my cash in marijuana stocks...Sobering up at 21 was the best decision of my life. I had so many bullshit ideas about the world and myself anyone who's struggling just keep at it.
