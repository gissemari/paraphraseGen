Hello guys..I went to my first AA today. It was a wonderful experience. Learned about HALT today...Hunger : Always keep your tummy full. If stomach is full chance of relapse reduces...Anger :  Our suppressed emotions are back. You can get angry easily. So keep calm and stay focussed. Try to just think about the moment...Lonely : Don't get lonely. Talk to people go out. When you are lonely your mind plays tricks with you. Keep yourself busy...Tired : Don't take too much stress or work too hard. Relax and enjoy....Here is a article explaining HALT in detail....http://m.addiction-recovery.com/HALT-hungry-angry-lonely-tired.php

Bravo for having the courage to go to a meeting. Don't stop now.
I personally have found that HALT is helpful to others also not just those seeking a sober life...When my beloved sister lost her husband to cancer she went into a horrible tailspin as you can imagine. He was only 60 no kids and they were just planning on retiring together...Anyway! The gist is I would get many sorrowful phone calls from her and reminding her of HALT and also journaling both seemed to help her manage a little bit better in her grieving...TL;DR It can work for anyone.
The gainz will be real.
I throw an extra T on there for thirsty. ..I will occasionally find myself having thoughts about cold beer if I am very dehydrated. ..Drink water! Stay hydrated !
