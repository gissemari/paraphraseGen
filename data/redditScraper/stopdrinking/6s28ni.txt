Made the apparent mistake of sharing my struggle and we'll kept secret with my SO today and felt a little shot down..he said he might not be able to handle this..my journey.  I drink too much wine but I have improved and on a mission to complete abstinence.  I did it for 5 years! I will succeed again. No its not easy...it's harder this time for some reason. But I have come along way. I'm not a raging alcoholic...but maybe to others it's just all the same. I am ashamed and my own worst critic.  I just didn't expect the judgement I got today. But it bears a stigma I guess. I support and cheer each of you on! We can do this! Our stories serve to help others who need a hand up!

Sober On!
You know my wife was not initially supportive but at time has gone on and things are better for me and us she is now. It might take time. In the meantime there is SD!
I find the abstinence part very difficult. If I had to do abstinence and deal with guilt  shame self esteem  I'd probably never quit!!..So I cheat.  I just do the abstinence part. If I can just do that part well it's good enough for me.
I think you could take a lot away from. Bren  Brown's book "Daring Greatly" I'm sure you're on the right path only you know best and he might come around maybe just not now. 
You are not alone. You might-feel-alone but you are not. You may have not got the response from your SO you expected-but give him time. Change is scary for most people. But what you are doing sounds right. And right is good honest real. Good should follow. I am inspired by your choice. I will not drink with you today.
