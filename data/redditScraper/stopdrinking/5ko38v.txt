I live with my parents and tomorrow they're going to be leaving for Hawaii to celebrate New Years with a couple of their friends. Living with family has helped a lot to keep me accountable; not having to sneak around/quietly dispose of several glass bottles at a time/make up bullshit lies all the time saves quite a bit of mental energy. ..The past two weeks have been difficult ones for me at work and the prospect of having an empty house to get wasted in is *really* tempting. Boredom and loneliness are two really big relapse triggers  for me and I need advice on what to do when I get home from work at 9:30 at night with nowhere to go and no one to talk to other than my dog.

Stay sober try to assess the situation write in a diary what you want to change that makes you bored and lonely. Use your time wisely to make strides towards being *less* lonely and bored. The next day after drinking you will feel hungover guilty *and* lonely *and* bored. As you can see alcohol only adds bad stuff and it intensifies your emotions already present. There is no creativity solutions or way out of things at the bottom of the bottle. We're with you you can do this!
