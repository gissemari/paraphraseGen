I'm almost 3 weeks sober but I'm finding myself facing some intense temptation.....Tonight my wife and I are entertaining her office for a work party and there's tons of booze. Everyone will be drinking. I don't have to worry about leaving the party. There's a persistent voice saying "you can just relapse you've done so well one night won't hurt". Nobody would even care or notice if I relapsed (I'm sure even my wife would understand). I know I shouldn't but honestly I can't think of a good reason not to. The thought of not drinking really bums me out. I know it's a fucked way of thinking about this but I need to say it out loud so my SD brethren can talk me off the ledge. ..Thanks for everything.

Gee I'm really glad you posted this.  OK let's step back: why did you think it made sense to stop drinking in the first place?  Was drinking a mere annoyance?  A trivial concern?  Or would you say you were more like a lot of us drinking is damaging your physical and mental health damaging your relationships and causing you concerns about being in control?  If the latter maintaining the commitment to yourself not to drink is in my experience incredibly important.  You go back to pre-withdrawal and in the blink of an eye you can find yourself acting out dangerously and uncontrollably.  I relapsed after 15 years and it cost me 7 lost years and by that time I lost nearly everything dear in my life.  ..So how do you get through this evening?  Stay away from the booze and the drinkers.  Keep a soft drink in your fist.  Go to bed early.  Clear out all left over alcohol immediately tomorrow.  ..Good luck.
