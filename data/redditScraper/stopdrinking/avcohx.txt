Last Saturday was the worst relapse if ever had I came home to my wife and two young boys at 5 in the afternoon the next day. I've never felt this low before. I feel like a truly disgusting human being

You're not a truly disgusting human being you're a human being trying to be free from an addictive poison. You're trying and that's the important thing...IWNDWYT!
it's okay to feel that way just try to use that negative energy as a source of positive motivation ..let it be the catalyst for change 
It is never too late. All of us here started with  day one. Make this day your own day one. IWNDWYT.
