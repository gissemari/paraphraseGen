I had a crap morning but i will not drink over it. I have been busy today at the library and collecting some cans to make some money..There is not any work around at the moment so I have to earn something everyday even just $10 worth of cans pays for petrol and food. I enjoy doing it. Its kinda gross but it takes my mind off things. I really hate drinking i keep remembering day one how horrible i felt. I feel good physically but mentally i have lots to work on with my anger and depression. But nothing is better than waking up without a rotten hangover and feeling so sick i can barley walk. I really really want to change my life. I want to work full time and possibly meet a girl and have a relationship. at 29 years old i should be married by now like my friends. Alcohol has taken everything good from me in life. Its a struggle but I know if i stay clear from alcohol it will slowly mend back together to live a great life. Get married one day and hold down a good paying job. Today is day 15 and i will not drink today or tonight.

Like the song says I have 99 problems but (Alcohol) isn't one! You're spot on with the anger and depression but we can deal with that on their own merit. .I'm 40s broke and single. I have faith that you will grab hold of the time you have to your advantage. The sky is the limit. I also believe that I can do better! Well done
