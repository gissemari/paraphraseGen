My sleep issues continue on and off. Last night not in my own bed (staying with family before moving daughter into college later today) and i was up and down at least 5-6 times. Big dinner last night may have contributed. And am in time zone an hour ahead yet hubbys alarm still went off shortly after 6...Still the quality of the sleep i did manage is so much better than in the past that i got out of bed feeling happy and optimistic and am enjoying my coffee...Those still struggling with sleep it does keep getting better. Have a great day

Congratulations on 33 days the daughter going to college and waking up feeling good in spite of rough sleep! My sleep is still sorting itself out too. I will join you in not drinking today. 
Yes- my exact experience lately!! I have broken sleep - starting day 4 today- but it is still 1000x better than how I slept and woke up/functioned while drinking. I woke up feeling so happy this am full of energy and optimism; totally understand your feelings!..Here's to a great sober day ahead and maybe a better night's sleep for both of us to tonight!  
It's great waking up feeling optimistic still a novel experience but I'm going to keep on enjoying it :)..I'm glad your sleep is getting better Serenader x
Congrats to you and your progress. I only got about 6 hours of sleep last night and it was broken as well but I somehow woke up still pretty refreshed and happy. Not drinking feels pretty dang good...Have a great day x
