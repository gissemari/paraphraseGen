**Last night was another challenge and potential milestone for me. This is what happened :)**..Last night I went to this alternative night in town. It's a monthly thing in a bar the same bar that I used to go to several times per week when my drinking problems reached their low ebb a few months ago...I'd already set my eye on going subconsciously several days ago. I've always sort of acutely known when I'm going to go out and [given my isolation issues recently](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2peyw6/quitting_is_going_well_but_im_in_a_rut_and_really/) I always knew I was going to. The difference this time was that I'd be drinking only soft drinks and not even considering alcohol...So I counted up the last of my money for a soft drinks budget (there's a bad habit in there still I'm sure) got ready and set off...Most of the night went moderately well without being spectacular. Because I was on my own I felt left out and so on but I had to remember that I always felt like that when I was drunk too not just while I was sober. I was more aware of my awkwardness though and trying to dance and all I wouldn't normally care about how I looked but I really did worry about looking ridiculous now I was self-aware...It was fun though I guess. I had brief conversations with a couple of people ones I probably wouldn't normally have if I'd been drinking as I'd have been looking to find someone more interesting or wanting to be where the action was or something. But I did feel like I can't really do the going out alone and making fun so easy anymore if I don't drink...The end of the night though turned an ok night into a really good one! I finally plucked up the confidence to try and dance for the final 15 minutes or whatever the sober person amidst the drunk people. I guess I was a little hyper from all the caffeine which helped...A guy came over and started dancing with me and it led to more (including me getting flooded by the fake snow machine because I felt like it) and we ended up kissing and so on. Pretty typical girl on a night out stuff except that I did it while I was sober! Said guy had apparently had his eye on me for much of the night and only plucked up the courage at the last minute...This might not seem like a big deal or even relevant to most but it was important to me because if I'd been drinking I'd have been obliterated by alcohol by that point. The positive outcome wouldn't have happened I'd have just looked tragic or have already went home angry at the fact that I don't have any friends...Instead I got to chat to the guy for 45 minutes after the night got his number and then got a free taxi home off a couple of older guys who were amazed that I seemed so lively despite being in their words "stone cold sober". People I'd not normally speak to because I'd be close to incoherent at that point...So it was a really awesome evening in the end! Great for my confidence and while I still think I struggle with drunk crowds when I'm not drinking it supported my decision to no longer drink entirely. The downside perhaps is that soft drinks are still expensive and I feel weird without a drink in my hand so I need to keep buying them. It's a psychological thing...So yeah I just figured I'd share...

Hopefully this doesn't come across as preachy but at only 19 days in you should try to avoid bars especially ones that you frequented during your average week.  I had a nice solid 4 months under my belt and thought I could hang at my old bar with all my old bar friends but it just turned out that even at 4 months it was way too soon to be in there.  The problem isn't that somebody else will try to convince you to have a drink because one won't kill you.  The problem is that you will eventually talk yourself into having one because one won't kill you.  I reset my badge twice this year and both times it was because I went to my old bar and hung out with my old bar buddies.  The second time it happened I arrived walked in the door walked to the bar where my friend was sitting he gave me a look as if to suggest that he was buying the bartender looks at me without any words and I ordered my beer.  It was over after that.  It's total commitment on either side of the fence for people who can't drink and it comes at a price if you choose to commit to not drinking.  You might have to give up some old friends and old stomping grounds.  Hopefully this isn't coming off the wrong way I just want you to know that if you have a problem with alcohol then going to places you used to get drunk in might be a bad idea this early in your recovery.
Good going!
This is only a challenge because you have  consciously chose to "go out". I hear about these self appointed "tests" frequently and I wonder to myself why? At what point do the risks outweigh the reward? Everyone is different but I have found that my relapse is a near-death sentence. The idea of having a fun time while putting my sobriety at the forefront of chance does not sound smart. All it takes is one lapse of judgment. Or for me I tend to think "just a couple" when I have an attractive patron by my side. Either you really like risk or you don't value your sobriety with such extremism as me. Good on you for not drinking though. I just have heard many a time when visit after visit seems to change and personal boundaries become muddled. Attraction gets thrown into the mix next and saying no to alcohol becomes that much harder. There are people actively refusing alcohol in situations that the are forced to be in such as work parties. Where in your story is there actual struggle
