Week 3 here (with a weekend relapse) and it's recycling day today all cans and bottles go into black boxes and we have 2 of them...So I lift the top one down and it's only half full that'll be because I'm not drinking I think shuddering at the vodka bottle responsible for my downfall on Fri...Go back to pick up second and it's completely empty! Usually they both overflow and I'm hiding the excess down the sides of our landfill bin...I will try my best to remember how that felt as I don't drink with you tonight :-)

Ha! I have recently been appalled to discover that my recycling bags are as full as ever except that now it's bottles of ginger beer instead of bottles of wine.
Yes! I'm looking forward to recycling collection tomorrow &amp; not hearing the Death Knell of wine bottles clanking into the lorry at 7am! I will not drink with you tonight.
Atta' girl Trina! Oh how I don't miss the old embarrassing recycling days! I was so mortified that I packed up bottles in black hefty bags and drove them to dumpsters in the middle of the night. Like a drunken fool I failed to realize that there were cameras all over the place and must have given people a show watching me lug the bottles and trip/fall all over trying to get them in the bin (I'm 5'1). Anyway you're doing great!!! :)
We have 'bottle pickers' that go through our recycling bins on garbage day to pick out the liquor and beer bottles to redeem them for cash. I saw him look towards my house with a perplexed look on his face last week. I hope someone in my neighborhood has extra empties for this poor guy. I probably paid his rent.
