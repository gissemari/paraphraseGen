I want this thread to be a list from the community of reasons not to drink.  Only add 1 reason per post.  No need for explanation.  Over time this thread will grow and can be used by those who are struggling.  They can look through the list of reasons and be sure to find a reason not to drink that fits their life...&amp;#x200B;..I am not drinking today.... because I want to improve my overall health.

Because at the end of the day it's rotten grape juice in a fancy bottle.
You really do need to do that laundry
Because hangovers are the wooooorst.
Cause if I do that's all I will do...No More Zero Days! Peace
It'll make you get fat! Most drinks really make a dent in your daily recommended calories. It also stimulates your appetite and the next day you're needing that hangover comfort food.  
so i can look my friends family SO in the eye. 
Alcohol is a jealous lover a cruel warden and a merciless executioner.
So you don't rob Future You of the decision to make it a week/month/year/decade/lifetime without a drink.
So you can deal with problems head on instead of deluding yourself that your life is going okay. 
So you'll remember that conversation
The panic of trying to remember what shitty thing you did is the worst feeling
For your wallet - not just the booze but the food impulse purchases and gas to get you to the store.
