Happy Fourth mis amigos. For the past maybe 5 years I've spent every 4th of July drinking all day; I always blacked out. Not today. I'm 100 (**!!!**) days sober and so proud to be here. This sub is helpful beyond words. People need a little encouragement in their lives and unfortunately often good friends and family can deprive us of that when actions toward self-improvement highlight struggles of their own. So if you're like me and have friends/family who still ask when your 'sober phase is over so we can enjoy a beer together like old times' instead of pushing you forward with a little encouragement: know that I'm proud of you. 120000 sobernauts here are proud of you too. Happy Independence Day and IWNDWYT!!

Thank you so much for that encouragement. At first it was a little scary to learn how much I had in common with so many people on this sub but now I feel so supported by everyone! Good luck on your journey and IWNDWYT!
