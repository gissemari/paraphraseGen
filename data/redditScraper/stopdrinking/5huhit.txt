So far its been 3 days. So far I have not had-..* any alcoholic beverages.* anxiety.* trembling and tremors.* thoughts of relapse.* Withdraws or medical complications..I've began looking into gym memberships. If the weather would warm up I'd like to go out jogging at the park. For 3 days I've been unchained I can do more activities now.

Good work.  I'm starting out again sober too.  
Right there w you. Except I can't sleep and I don't feel happy quite as much. I guess it effects us all differently.
