So I'm on Day 5 and am struggling to find motivation to do anything.  I know not drinking is the best choice for me but I'm sad to not be able to drink occasionally (we all know how that works out).  I had a 3-week stretch of not drinking back in November and a glimmer of positive changes but I knew I was going to give myself "permission" to drink on Thanksgiving.  Of course that opened the door to daily drinking yet again.  So I'm starting over and trying not to expect a life transformation overnight.

I give myself time to not do anything when I don't feel motivated. I tell myself it's ok to do nothing!   
It's important to just get through the day. I get those sober "don't wanna do anything" days all the time. Go to Starbucks and people watch. Kinda creepy I know but it helps me. Also calling old friends and just talking should give you a boost to get off your ass...I'm back on the wagon for good this time  ..I won't be drinking today!
Well done on 5 days!  I'm on day 1 yet again and I'm not even struggling to find motivation to do anything as I'm hungover. Stick with it; this isn't where you want to be. 
Good job &amp; keep going. Bad days happen. Drink won't improve them. I will not drink with you today.
Tough to deal with these days.  Nothing drastic but getting outside helped me.  Treat yourself to something.  You deserve it keep up the good work.
I recommend reading This Naked Mind. It helped me so much with struggling with drinking moderation etc..
I hear you and felt the same. Day 5 was awful I was so tired. Felt low. Some lovely people on here explained how it may be all those toxins and alcohol leaving your body and that this will pass. Stay strong and it will get better.   For me although I wasn't bouncing around day 6 was easier and I had more energy. I will not drink with you today.
