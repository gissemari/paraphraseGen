My husband just deployed and I took it hard... ended up doing a hard binge for several days. I've reached the point where I'm fed up with myself and just want to let that go so I can be there fully for my family...I tried to quite cold turkey two days ago and the symptoms were rough (no tremors seizures voices etc - just felt awful) so I'm currently trying to taper gradually instead. I bought a pack of light beer last night and have been drinking one every hour to keep the symptoms at bay then plan to increase to 1.5 hours/2 hours/3 hours etc every day or two depending on how it goes until I get to where I don't have withdrawal symtoms when I stop...For those that have successfully tapered to give up alcohol do you have any tips? I plan to go in the morning to buy Pedialyte to drink along with water in-between drinks. But is there anything else that can make it a little more bearable? I'm quite alone right now (husband just left family just left on a cruise and my two friends just moved away so basically no personal support) so I'm struggling and would love some support/advice.

I tapered down from 2 bottles of wine a day for 10 years. Basically what I did was switch to beer (the same alcohol amount of the wine I was drinking so about 4 liters of beer) and drop 0.5 liters per day per week so it took me about 2 months to taper. If you've been drinking less time you can probably taper more quickly than this (well my taper was super slow anyways). ..Gatorade or whatever is a good choice. I would avoid caffeine because your body will be jittery anyways when you take out the depressant alcohol. My blood sugar was out of whack so focusing on eating every couple of hours helped (my body was trained to be thirsty when I was really hungry). Pushups jogging walking with an audiobook helped with the anxiety. I added some liver stuff to my vitamins like liv52 and milk thistle. Something like valerian or melatonin can help sleep in the early days. I would try and eat a huge late dinner to sedate me at night...The psychological part was the hardest for me and the memory I cherish now when I get a craving. It's totally okay to hate the detox and be thankful for small victories...If it's an option for you I would recommend visiting the doctor and they can give you something just in case things take a turn for the worse with tremors or seizures.

In my experience if you aren't getting tremors you probably don't need to worry about tapering your consumption. I've done it a few times and sadly just kind of sucks so you might consider giving cold turkey another shot. Also I feel tapering was just a springboard to a slippery slope to starting drinking again. Sorry kind of a non-answer.
Go to urgent care and tell them you're quitting. They gave me a script for Gabapentin. It helps dramatically working on GABA in the brain to calm down your central nervous system to avoid the tremors anxiety sweating etc. After a week your GABA levels should start to naturally level out as your brain produces its own again.
