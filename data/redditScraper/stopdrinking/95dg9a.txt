My biggest problem with remaining sober is that I love going out on weekends and I'm extremely social. It doesn't take long for me to feel isolated and become depressed. I'm sure many of you can relate. My relapses ALWAYS happen on a weekend. During my longest period of sobriety I definitely started to feel lonely. I live in a region with cold winters which makes it even more difficult to stay busy and sober. What helped a lot of you with boredom isolation keeping your mind busy etc?

Meetings might be an option. AA SMART etc... Might help you meet some fellow sober people.
