I made it nearly a month then had a few wine nights at home this last week. I used to drink until I blacked out and I would drink morning to night. Now I have been attempting sobriety and every relapse is much more mild but causes a surge in anxiety and renewed remorseful feelings about how horrible the drinking used to be. Here's my biggest struggle: I feel like I have no support. My parents and my brother are terrible alcoholics and like to even tease me about how I don't drink. My SO is a pothead and when I struggle with cravings he tells me just to do whatever I want. I know that my sobriety is my own cross to bare but I just wish I had some real face to face interaction with someone who supports my journey. I come to this sub a lot but I still feel very alone and the desire to be sober has alienated me from everyone else in my life. I need to go to meetings and I wonder what your thoughts might be on attending both AA and Alanon.

I have found therapy to be really really helpful for me. I like the confidential aspect and the fact that it is focused on me and what I want to work on. ..I think a lot of people go to AA and AlAnon - one to deal with their own addiction and the other to learn to live with their loved one's addiction. ..I'm a big fan of "the more tools the better" when it comes to recovery. 
I got sober in AA and i know plenty of people who do both programs...In fact one AA I know with 20 plus years says that all AA's should go to at least one Al Anon meeting because they either dated or are related to an alcoholic...
I think that's a great idea to go to both AA and Al-Anon.
