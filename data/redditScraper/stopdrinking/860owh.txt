Good morning fellow sobernauts! Welcome to Wednesday or what I believe we refer to here as  hump day'. I've always found Wednesdays something of a challenge. In the midst of the week when work pressures accumulate it can be easy to lose focus...I've found that keeping what I call a  highlights reel' works wonders. By remembering all of my high points   the highlights   I have the motivation to stay true to the path I'm on. My highlights reel collects screenshots of my family's messages that I refer to when I'm low...My wife Cara saying:  I'm so proud of you.  My son Ross saying  What you are doing means the world to me.  My daughter Caitl n saying  Go girl!  (I am not a girl but it works!)..When I'm struggling and I feel temptation rearing its ugly head I find that taking a little time out and reflecting on these messages helps me considerably. The bottom line: We are not alone...As important as my family family is my r/stopdrinking family. All of you! I've found the support here tremendous and I thank you for it from the bottom of my heart. We're in it together every single day...So here goes my daily pledge: **I will not drink with you today!** Good luck everyone have a great Wednesday!. .---. .*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*. .**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**. .I'm pledging myself to not drinking today and invite you to do the same.. .Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.. .It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours lets not drink alcohol!. .---. .**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!. .What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up.. .**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.. .**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.. .---. .This post goes up at:. .    US - Night/Early Morning  .    Europe - Morning  .    Asia and Australia - Evening/Night..A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar...---

Hello! I've been missing check ins and generally being AWOL for days because I've been so busy but I'm still sober and I'm excited to see my badge! 
I'm working in a grey Ireland but I managed a  wun' (walk/run) at 6am and I feel good IWNDWYT 
Watching the Married At First Sight finale here in Aus. It's sooo bad yet so enjoyable! IWNDWYT.
Up before I needed to be by about four hours  time to kick the arse of another sober day. IWNDWYT
Checking out for 21 March ... nothing wrong with going to bed at 8.20pm right?! I got through the day I stayed sober.  
Hey SD! I'm not drinking today. Have a wonderful Wednesday!..Shout out to my fellow "Nor'easterner's" - we'll get through this!
Really having a shit time at the moment. Not feeling any benefits from being sober and continually fighting off the urge to begin considering  moderation'. Rationally I know this is impossible for me. Low on motivation low on energy and just miserable. Apologies for not being positive like normal! Still I'm not going to drink today.
I will not drink with you all today!  24 hours let's do this!  
Happy humpday SD! Not drinking with you today.
Here in the Pacific NW I am nursing a sinus infection.  Definitely not drinking tonight...And this is my 2 week mark!!
I will not drink with you today. ..Days are building up!
I will not drink today on my big 3-0. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart for being here. Between this group and AA I know I can string more days together.
On a biz trip all the other girls have a glass of wine or trippy cocktail. A month or two ago this made me thinking a lot about whether it was really not that bad and maybe....now something has kicked in.  So proud of my accomplishment and love all the positive gains that goes with it a life without wine.  "I gave up one thing to have everything"  is the title of the current chapter in my life.  Thanks for the support. IWNDWYT.
Alcohol sucks. I will not drink today. 
I will not drink with you today!
I didn't drink in Aus with you today and I won't tonight!..Had an excellent hump day! All the jobs were smooth and had zero dramas. Life is good!
I will not drink today.
Alcohol does not feature in my day today...No mamatter what happens I will not drink with you SD :)
I will not drink today 
Checking in from a snowstorm. Cold and a bit grouchy but still sober :) IWNDWYT
I will not drink today.
Had a few strong cravings early on last night pushed past them and drank 4 sparkling waters and a cherry Coke Zero   but I'm on morning of day 3 and my kids have a snow day from school (in spring!) that I can be present for mentally and physically!
I will not drink with you today 
I will not drink today
Count me in :)
I will not drink today!  Snow day where I am so I am staying home from work.  Plan to have a cozy day in with my husband my pups and some movies.
Checking to say I will not drink with you all today! Wish everyone a positive day.
Good morning SD fam. I've been such an early riser since I quit and I love it. I'll get up shower have my coffee and hit a meeting and then I still have my whole day ahead of me. It's great!..IWNDWYT 
Good morning good afternoon or good night SD! I'm content today and that means I don't even want to drink with you today. I'd love to have a cup of coffee with you tho. 
I will not drink with you today. Enjoy the day everyone!
The 'highlight reel' is a great idea! I will not drink with you today.
Another day another snowstorm here! But I won't be drinking during it!!!

It's 6.20pm Wednesday &amp; our Autumn equinox here in West Aus &amp; it is still about 34C (93F) just beautiful.... I will gladly send warmth &amp; sunshine to all who are cold &amp; wet  ..And here is a pic of my dopey dog T wearing socks because he won't stop licking his paws..... [Oh Mum!!! WHY???](https://i.imgur.com/lKZDDpI.jpg).... LOL..So I didn't drink this morning or this afternoon &amp; I very gratefully will Not be drinking tonight! I am also very very grateful to say that today I am feeling much more like my quirky self  
Heyyyy 25 days down one more to go. Thank you ME for working so hard on being better right now. 
No drinking here - having to spend an exra day at conference due to snow back home wish I was heading home today but am ok with one more day. Plan on caving after AM conference endings and just chill sober style!
I will not drink today
Booze free hump day! IWNDWYT!
Good morning fellow sleepy heads. Ugh. So sleepy all the time! Anyhoo. I will not drink with you today!
I will not drink with you today!
Not today. Not today. Not today!!!!
Hump day! Halfway to the weekend my lovely sober friends! I will not drink with y'all today. :)
To the OP  Go girl!  Cracked me up!!   Keeping a mental highlight reel is an excellent idea.  No drinking for me today.  Bracing for another snowstorm bleh. 
I will not drink with you today!
What beautiful thoughts Christopher - quite brightened my somewhat tired Wednesday evening! Now I'm having lovely flashbacks to the positive things some of my friends and daughter have said lately - bless :) Frantic kind of day with a big drive at the end to the nearest city and back so obvs no drinking on the menu! Not drinking tonight either and will not drink with y'all tomorrow either :) Happy Hump Day everyone!. 
Another day done another begins...
Had a challenging day yesterday to put it mildly.  A few months back the situation would have me ending up knee deep in a bottle til I could sleep myself into avoidance. No more! I am feeling real emotions and dealing with this bump in the road sober for once.  I can't say it feels good  but definitely empowering and responsible. Hoping for the slightest bit of improvement today at least  I will not drink with you today. 
First part of a route canal today..Hate it..Craving a drink for days now..I will not drink with you today..That chocolate will never know what hit it though.
Thanks Mr Murph! I will not be drinking with you all today!
Best of luck to you all. I will not drink with you today.
I will not drink with you today on this snowy spring Wednesday. 
I will not drink today even though I am in a major angry episode and don't know what to do. 
Checking in at my favourite hotel. Le Sobriete
No booze today!
I will not drink with you today!
Been a few days! New job is really taking over my time in the mornings. Gotta switch up my routine a bit. Will not drink with you today!   
I will not drink today 
I will not drink with you today.  I will be present and in the moment with my wife and kids.  Coffee cheers to the other sobernauts!
I will not Drink with you today!..
Still here and will be for another 24 hours! Love being able to check in daily. Have a great day.
I will not drink today.
I signed in to yesterday twice!!! Ok well I'll even that out right now:  I will not drink with you today!  ..**those who cannot their minds will not change anything else**..I used to think drinking was something I *needed*.  Relied on.  I changed my mind.
I like the idea of a highlights reel u/mrmurphyltd. That is actually something that I could use in every area of my life. When the 'dementors' tell me I'm worthless I need to review my highlight reel. Thanks...I won't drink today!
Thank you!! Hope you have a fab first full day of spring!
I will not drink with y'all today!!
I will not drink today. 
Thanks for your encouragements Christopher. IWNDWYT

Not today.
Happy Hump Day mofos. I will not consume any alcoholic beverages with you today.  
Not drinking today.  
I just realized I checked in for Wednesday on Tuesday. Oops. Hey so happy Wednesday SD! I won't be drinking with you today either. Happy snow day if you're lucky enough to stay in and be careful out there if you have to head out. It's a good day for tea and sugary treats.
Good morning everyone! Had a good and busy day yesterday. Busy day at work and I didn't want to really punch any of my coworkers for a change. Always nice. Yoga after work then came home and made chocolate chip cookies. Didn't drink and had no desire to. And I will not drink with you today!
I will not drink today!
Will not drink today. 
I will not drink with you wonderful people today!
I will forgo just ONE drink today !  The First One
Wow experienced a really horrible case of PAWS last night.  This harsh depressive rage came over me and I felt like cracking open a few to feel better but I prevailed the best I could.  Instead I put my kids to bed a bit early and went to bed myself.  Today i woke up feeling back to my old cheery self.  I had a major epiphany on the way to work this morning last night would have been a classical time for me to relapse.  Thinking back over my various efforts to quit before joining SD it was precisely when these moods struck I would drink most often and these moods seem to be caused by PAWS which is caused by trying to quit!  What a horrible cycle.  ..Not this time!  IWNDWYT 
Checking in. IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you today. 
Day 66!! 
Stuck in airports all day.  Send positive energy my way!  IWNDWYT!
Not today. Today's crunch time and I cannot afford a hangover.
Wicked Wednesday I got this you got this we got this! Happy to not drink with you today!
I have no energy and I can't focus at work but I will not drink with y'all today!  This sub is the best!
I will not drink today!
i will not drink with you today
Making this day count. I won't drink with you all today!
I can do this.  IWNDWYT
One day down. My hand is all kinds of fucked up but other than that things are pretty good today. I won't drink today.
Three weeks! I will not drink today.
Day two saw my return to the gym after weeks of being too tired/lazy/hungover to spend even an hour working on my physical fitness. I ate a healthy diet yesterday. Getting rid of the nasty sodium-laden nutritionally void junk that always seemed like such a great accompaniment to my beer has helped me shed a couple pounds of water weight already. Looking forward to what today will bring but no matter what IWNDWYT. 
IWNDWYT!!

Good morning I will not drink with you today!

 Alcohol is not the answer. It just makes us forget the question -anonymous .I will not drink with y'all today! 
Happy hump day. I will not be drinking with you all today!
Wednesdays are always tough for me as I have the night to myself. Instead of drinking a pint of liquor I will be on my rowing machine doing pushups and jump roping. I will not drink with you all today.
I'm here to say that today I will not drink with you!
25 days! Woo Hoo! Never thought I would get this far
I'm in this for another day. I have no one to hold me accountable today except myself. I don't feel scared about that though. 
It's Wednesday! I will not drink with you today
Day 1 of my 5 day work conference. Big exam in just 4 hours! Even at the airport yesterday I bumped into a friend who said we should "celebrate" after being done the exam. Well I'll be celebrating for sure but with a fancy coffee drink or a sparkling water because I will not drink with you all today!
Ahhhhh 5 inches of snow in Cincifuckingnati last night with more to come! I cannot deny it is pretty...for 10 minutes! I put some hot chocolate in my coffee this morning! **IWNDWYT!!!**

On day 17 of 28 so not drinking today. Tomorrow there will actually be two opportunities to drink -- one's an open bar. But it's not within my plans.
Tomorrow's 80 days. So far I haven't had any cravings thank God... feeling better than I have since I was 18 (I'm 26 now) 8 years of wasted potential but that's over now..Thanks everyone for participating in this sub
I will not drink today.
I will not drink today. 
Good morning.  Not drinking today 
I will not drink today! 
Welp the honey money phase of sobriety has worn off. I've been in a bad place these last two days. ..I haven't been getting good sleep and that is having a direct impact on my mood...In addition all the feelings that I was using alcohol to try and suppress have started to surface again. ..Life is good and I shouldn't complain but I'm feeling very lonely...I think I finally realized that my "insomnia" is more like late night anxiety. My brain races from worry to worry like it is circling a drain but unable to purge itself and these bad emotions just continue to swirl around my head until I clamp my eyes shut even tighter and try to focus on the void and let sleep overtake me. ..I'm not throwing this sobriety away though. I've come this far and I refuse to succumb to my own weak will and trivial desires. ..Tired and alone but IWNDWYT.
Good morning I will not drink with you today. 
Keep it going today signed loving my star friend
Good morning /sd! IWNDWYT!

Starting day 3 - I absolutely will not drink today 
I will not drink today. Stuck at home for the time being due to a freak Spring snowstorm that could end up dumping a foot of snow. So glad I'm not panicking about whether there's enough booze in the house to make it through!

Snow..snow..snow..and wonderful DC traffic..a lot more fun with no hangover. .I will not be drinking with you today and I will never drink again and I will never change my mind. .
I will not drink today!
Day 12. Had a *really* strong urge to drink after a rough training shift but I read posts here while waiting for sleepy meds to kick in (which still didn't put me to sleep one of the fun things in early recovery I guess) and then eventually went to sleep. Still stressed about finding a place to live and perfect place was just rented this past weekend but I do have several leads so hopefully it will work out. Whatever happens alcohol will only make it worse...I will not drink with you today.
Phew spring break with kids and working from home. Super stressful but I'm definitely dealing with it better than if I were drinking or hungover. I'm not drinking with you all today.
Good Morning! Feelin' great and ready to not drink with ya'll today.
I will not drink with you today! I hope everyone has a great day!
I will not drink with you today 
I will not drink today!
Good morning SD.  Too much coffee late in the day yesterday so a bit of a bad sleep but at least it was caffeine related!  I won't drink with you all today.
 I am not a girl but it works    Thanks for bringing a smile to my face this morning. Your family sounds so lovely and it's so great you have that support! ..I had a hard couple days this week but I swallowed my pride and let go of my instinct to deal with things myself   I called up my friend in AA who's been sober 3 years and told her I'm struggling. I feel so much better having done so and am heading to my first of two meetings tonight. ..IWNDWYT 
Sometimes I can forget how much I need everyone in my life. I do get caught up in my selfish thoughts and actions. Last night I was totally enveloped in recovery with 70 people for 4 hours... speaking about sobriety... I couldn't help but to the think of ALL the people who helped direct me here... Amazing that 4 years ago I felt so alone so isolated and yesterday I was surrounded by people. Good stuff! And I will not drink with you today!
Good morning! I will not drink with a single one of ya today! May your day be filled with awareness and peace.
w00t!!! Got me a star today!! 30 days and feeling good. I will not drink with you today :)
I will clear my mind with meditation today.
I will not drink with you today.  Going for double-digits :)
Checking in. Even though I have to study today I know I'll be able to!  I will not drink with you today. :)
This is my first day saying this: I will not drink with you all day! First 24 hours I can do this!
It's going to be a day of hard work spending too much money on an unplanned car repair and riding in a car for four hours.  Baaaaahhhhh. ..But I won't drink or smoke. .
I will not drink today 
Good morning my friends. I will not drink with you today!
I will not drink with you today!
I'm not drinking today. 
I will not drink with y'all today. Happy spring!   
Of course  I'm here ready for another sober day  so I won't drink with you today. 
Checking in for the start of day 2! I feel like absolute garbage right now but at least I'm not hungover. IWNDWYT
Marriage is in a tough spot but not going to let that get in the way of my freedom from poison. ..I am not going to drink today.
I won't drink with you today. Enjoy your blessing of sobriety today folks.
I will not drink today.
Day 2. No booze for me. Going for 24 hours and 30 days. 
Day 41. Flying back to a place that gives me such anxiety I've always needed to drink. Not today! I will not drink with you today. 
Life is still fairly painful. Yesterday work put up something my ex and I worked on as part of an office art installation and I lost my shit. I spent a good ten minutes crying in a bathroom and came dangerously close to visiting the liquor store after my shift - I was standing outside the place trying to determine if it was worth it. I ended up going home having a poor man's rice bowl for dinner and waited to fall asleep ready to face another miserable day. ..IWNDWYT. 
Even though I have stumbled and been drinking even to the point of blacking out last night. I will not drink with a single one of you today. .It's all about how many times you get up right?
Thank you Mr. Murphy! IWNDWYT 
I will not drink with you all today!
I am not going to drink today.
i will not drink today.  While not the only reason because I will hit a week tomorrow!
I will not drink today!.
Good day SD.  Hard to beleive how quickly these last 10 days have flown by with no hangovers.  Increased energy.  Feeling fiiine.    IWNDWYT! !!  
I will not drink today. Here is to the next 365 days!
Exactly 6 weeks today. And seeing some day 1 post titles pretty similar to what I posted then. I'm not feeling great today but still feeling better than I did then. IWNDWYT!!
I will not drink today. Out the window there are little whirls of cloud drifting by birds darting below them. It's nearly time to cook dinner and pack up boxes for a move at the end of the month. I haven't got much work done today but for the first time in a while I feel happy and I wish you all happiness too whoever and wherever you are.
I will not drink today. 
I will not drink with you all today!
Checking in!   
Good morning SD! ..I guess I'd like to share about how dependent my sobriety is on my marriage being good. It's ironic that my drinking is what sent it to the shitter in the first place. ..We had an argument Sunday night. 5 weeks ago that would have meant screaming holes in the wall police at the house and most definitely me grabbing a case of shit beer and going full steam ahead. I've never hit her and never would drunk or sober but all of this other stuff is just as toxic. I'm so grateful that that's not how we handle things any more. My wife has BPD which has been difficult for me to understand on a very deep level. When I was drinking we both knew exactly what buttons to push on each other and it was a fucking mess. ..On Sunday I told her how I felt and then had the sense to go hang out in the spare bedroom for the night instead of standing there and escalating things. I'm so grateful that my I'm able to make decisions for the good of both of us and prevent a full-blown fight. We both woke up Monday and realized how stupid the argument was and moved on. I can't get over how much less volatile an argument can be when one participant isn't half in the bag. ..Anyway the rest of our new bed comes today and I'm going to spend today getting that set up finally taking the rest of my old empty cans out of the basement and to the redemption center and then going on a La Croix (or Bubly it's pretty good if you haven't tried it yet!) shopping spree. =) have a great day love you all! 
Forgot to check in earlier this morning. IWNDWYT.
Thanks for the positive thoughts after a lousy night mrmurphy. Makes today look better! Checking in for Wednesday. IWNDWYT.
Won't be drinking with you today.

Hey everybody! Not drinking today!
I have this big construction paper on my wall with a lot of quotes and stuff my family has wrote in there to encourage me. Words are very powerful. Here ill tell you one that I'm looking at right now. "STAY BUSY IF YOU KEEP YOUR GRIND RIGHT IT WILL KEEP YOUR MIND RIGHT" IWNDWYT!!
Really really bad nightmare last night. Like...standard horror movie affair stuff. Except weirdly this one *still* ended in me drinking a lot and rolling around in my own puke in the lobby of a restaurant. Evidently that's one of my worst fears...So! On that note! Not drinking with you all today! Best wishes you all!
I won't drink work you today!
I can't promise I won't be downing a stress pint of Halo Top later but I can promise I will not drink today. Yay harm reduction!

One day at a time. IWNDWYT.

Day 4 - first day of therapy in an hour. My anxiety is at an all time high but I will not drink today! 
 
Decided I need to do the check in daily again. I've had more than a few moments where I've thought "Eh one drink isn't going to hurt." That way madness lies....
I will not drink today!
I will not succumb to the typical  oh it's a blizzard! Let's get blitzed!' I will not drink with you today!
Great idea MrMurphyltd! And happy hump day all! I am sitting on my couch curled up with a nice cup of dark roast coffee and watching the beautiful snow fall! Later I am meeting up with a friend I graduated college with for dinner who's in town on business. Excited to see her and I'm not even worried a bit that I'll drink because I just know that I won't. Feels good to know that and I'm not taking it for granted. ..Carry on fellow sobers have a lovely day and I will not drink with you today! 
So happy to be here and to be sober. I will not drink with you today!

Evening from the UK - couldn't check in this morning due to work - I haven't had a drink today and I won't drink with you tonight. I have to check in with my new sponsor at 7 pm   
Love to everyone here! IWNDWYT.The steps I am taking to treat my illness have been working. The desire to drink has faded away. Life has more purpose. Obstacles are exciting challenges instead of depressing roadblocks..If you are new to recovery keep going. Keep trying. ...

A beautiful Thursday morning here so grateful for my new way of living. 
I will not drink today!
I will not drink with you today.
Happy to not drink with you today! 
I've had a bit of a rough go the past few months: Broke up with my girlfriend lots of changes unhappiness etc.  And I began to realize that drinking for me was more than just "a good time."  In many ways it had become a way of existing.  While I wasn't waking-up-in-a-ditch alcoholic or losing-my-job-alcoholic or whatever you would count as rock bottom I was definitely a little overweight (mostly due to my affinity for beer) and very unhappy.  My job was struggling as well as being behind on my bills (but always having money for beer!)...Honestly I was going nowhere.  And I didn't like that. All the dreams and plans I wanted in my life felt more like dreams and *not* plans.  I had to face the truth: Alcohol instead of being a social vehicle or a small pleasure was affecting my life too much and stealing my happiness and productivity...So I stopped drinking...It was difficult at first because I could really go on some huge benders.  I woke up hallucinating several times seeing lights and patterns in my room or once that I was fenced in.  It was hard and confusing.  ..But slowly it's getting better...I hit a rough patch this weekend and tricked myself into drinking: "I'll just have a beer. It's been a long day and one beer won't count because I won't get drunk."  But one beer turned into two beers which turned into a small bottle of Jack Daniels which caused me to rifle through my roommates whiskey.....And I woke up Sunday hungover. I felt the pain and shame I had felt before. And the truth was confirmed: Alcohol had threw me off my center more than I want to admit.  I am not in control when I start drinking (even though sometimes I *think* I am in control and only have a few drinks I really am not)...Is life better?  I don't know.  I feel lonely a lot.  Sometimes I'm scared that people won't want to hang out with me because I'm no longer drinking.  The climbing gym I go to is closing in six weeks and everything that provided me "comfort" just a few months ago is slowly being taken away from me.  I want to find a new career but unsure of the path or where it will take me or if it's possible...But I'm determined to figure this out to see how sobriety helps me and figure out where this path might take me.  I don't want my dreams to remain just dreams--I want to make them come true.  But it'll be a long hard path...I promise to not drink with you guys today.
I will not drink with you today. Decided to go for a nice run and hit the gym instead.
Better day. ..I will not drink with you today
80 days today! My boss was really ill so I had to do his presentation at a conference we're at. I've never done public speaking to that degree before and I only had 24 hours notice. I don't think I could have done it if I was still drinking because the anxiety would have been too much...Now I believe in myself a lot more and my abilities and absolutely smashed the presentation!..Going to celebrate by NOT drinking!
It's been another rough day at work but I will not drink with you today!

Iwndwyt. Think i got One of those screenshots you speak of today when a friend who generally only knew me drunk told me its a lot nicer to have a conversation with me now and i push a discussion a lot further without looping and still keep in track. That felt fucking awesome to hear. Progress.

Great job everyone. I am eating a salad! Not drinking anything but tea coffee and water! It sounds miserable but it's frickin' great!
Guess no one said this was going to be easy but didn't expect it to be this hard I manage a few days then WHAM back drinking. It's like any excuse and there I go. I really want to stop for many reasons. So for tonight I will not be drinking with you.
I will not drink today.
I am struggling and I'm glad to find this Reddit community. I get 24 hours everyday but then I drink after work when I'm alone. I've had to pay $1000 in the last 3 months for things lost while drunk. I struggle because I live in a small town where there are no meetings after 8 p.m. at night. And I work 11 and 12 hour shifts every day.  I really need fellow sobriety seekers around late nights.
Checking in and still not drinking with you! 
Not drinking with you all! Much love and strength to everyone.

Checking in - managed to avoid drinking despite the abundance of Alcohol being offered in 1st class on business trip.  . Interesting how judgey I became with others who were drinking - Jeez it's 11:00am really? But they were also able to stop at 2 drinks - really.
