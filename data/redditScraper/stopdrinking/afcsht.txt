Hello everyone! I am a long time lurker to this sub. I've been visiting this sub for over a year. ..In December I started realizing how negatively alcohol was impacting my health relationships work performance and my overall life. However I continued to drink wine on most of my work nights and drink myself into oblivion on Friday nights. Waking up New Years morning with a horrific hangover and not remembering the majority of the night I decided enough is enough. I didn't want to wake up feeling physically sick and anxious. I didn't want to wake up not knowing what I did who I pissed off or hear stories about the idiotic things I would do or say. Most of all I knew deep down inside I was using alcohol to deal with my issues. I hopped on this sub and read probably over 100 different posts about how extraordinary life can be once you put the drinks down. ..12 days in I'm feeling a clarity I haven't felt in years. I have been able to finish tasks and projects I've been putting off forever. At work I'm so much more effective and efficient. I'm enjoying time with my family and friends without the urge to drink. I'm working on my issues with a sober state of mind.I've been going places I've never been. I just feel like I'm becoming the person I've always wanted to be. I'm starting to see how beautiful and amazing life can be. Thank you to every single person on here who is brave enough to share their stories struggles and celebrations as it has really helped me. Now I need to figure out how to make my badge on here
