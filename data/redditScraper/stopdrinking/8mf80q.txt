I want to thank you all for sharing and remaining positive. I am turning a new leaf in my life. Today was my last hangover. Instead of laying in bed all day waisting my life in guilty self loathing I came here. I read many of your experiences and struggles and triumphs then I got up and cleaned my entire apartment purging all my unnecessary stuff. And tomorrow I will work around beers and drunks and be surrounded again. But because of you all I know I can do this. I think I will look for jobs during my shift and bring a lot of alternative beverages. I can do this.

Yes you can. Welcome! You can get a badge on the sidebar if you'd like to see your day count. I'm glad you're here and I will not drink with you today. :-).
Yes you can! Take it one day at a time damn take it one hour at a time it you have to. But you got this!.IWNDWYT
One day at a  time I got stronger and it got easier for me.  Now I am filled with life and hope.  You can do this.  Life gets better sober.  I wish you the very best on your journey.  I'm rooting for you! IWNDWYT 
Get after it buddy!  I'd recommend setting up a badge too as I've found that really helpful like that silly little counter reminds me that I'm adding it up to positive healthy days free from alcohol.
I Won't Drink With You Today !
