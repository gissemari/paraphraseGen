For me the trick was to change.  I had to take a different route home had to avoid the beer aisle in the store and go to meetings - even though I was hearing things I did not want to admit were true...I had to stop feeling sorry for myself realize that stopping drinking was in NO WAY a deprivation that I was not in some way entitled to what was essentially self harm...I had to make new sober friends at the meetings and hang out with them when I otherwise would have been wallowing in self pity...I had to rebuild my self esteem- starting with **not drinking today will make me a better person**
You got this!  I struggled hard yesterday.  The cravings were terrible.  The thoughts of my drinking brain almost took over. ..But I did it!  And here I am today proud of the decision I made and feeling much better.  ..I played it forward. I knew what would happen. ..Stay strong my friend.  IWNDWYT 
Trust that there is so much good in store for you ahead

The struggle is real and we truly get it. .Recognize H. A.L. T. Hungry: Eat and drink some juice.  Angry: Breathe! Meditate! Lonely: Call a friend. Get out and walk. Tired: Relaxing bath and sleep. Be kind to yourself . 
Thinking of you. It's so damn hard sometimes but you will get there    keep fighting. 
Thank you! I made it through that day   so grateful that i did.
