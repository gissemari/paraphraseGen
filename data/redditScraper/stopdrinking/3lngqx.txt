This last relapse has been the worst I had quit drinking and I was going to meetings. I was sober for 46 days then something happened I don't even remember why when or how it happened exactly. But I'm especially scared right now because I have resigned myself as not being able to help myself to drinking and feel incapable of quitting. I hope I can make it through tomorrow without drinking till I blackout. My biggest problem is trying to stay motivated about staying away from alcohol. There are so many things out there that trigger me to want to have that first drink. How do y'all cope with the temptation?

I relapsed a month ago and have since recommitted to being sober. You can do it!..Caffeine helps me stay away from alcohol. That might be trading one vice for another but I think that is much safer and far less destructive than alcohol. I tend to go to coffee shops and work (I work remotely) do duolingo or just browse the news/reddit. It has helped a lot especially in the early days when my withdrawal was really bad...Best of luck to you. You got this.
What kind of drinker were you? Beer liquor mixed drinks?  I was mostly a beer drinker but was also big into mixed drinks.  I found that making myself a mix of cranberry juice &amp; sparkling water was like going through the motions of making a captain Morgan &amp; ginger ale and actually soothed me and stopped the cravings..I also do daily meditations/reflections.  That helps start my day with a calm mind.  I use Taoist philosophy but the Bible would work too.  Heck anything positive would..I also come in here every time I think about drinking.  Most of the time just reading other people's posts helps me out.  It's like going to an Open Discussion AA meeting and just listening...Hope this helps.
