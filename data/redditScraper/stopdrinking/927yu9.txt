First timer here... please be gentle!..I've been sober 20 days. Today I stopped at our local bodega and bought the coldest bottle they had. I drink straight liquor and I haven't eaten. Truth be told I don't even want to drink but I feel like this is my only outlet. Today was horrible!..I work a difficult and demanding job and on my way to work my significant other made me feel awful in my way to work. I didn't give him a kiss on my way out to work because I was late. He proceeded to jump into a barrage of accusations that I haven't done... ..Fuck today. I relapsed.

Have you been drinking today?
Hi there Jen. Welcome back. You are not alone. Many of us have relapsed and got back on the sobriety train. Let's do this. I know you can. IWNDWYT:-)
Wishing you the best as you take the next step on the journey.  You can do this! I will not drink with you today.
