Hello. I've been dealing with alcoholism for over 2 years now. My longest time of being sober is 1 month before relapsing and I'm willing to do it again. ..My main issue with completely quitting is constantly having this feeling of wanting to get drunk while I'm playing games which I do a lot. That is practically the only way I can enjoy drinking/playing games and I've made it an incredibly bad habit. I'm thinking about just completely staying off the computer for a bit to ease this feeling while staying on the sober train. ..Any ideas r/stopdrinking?

My drinking became entwined with all sorts of other activities too although I never was a gamer... I was convinced that alcohol made everything better but that was really just the addiction lying to me and the force of habit in action.....Video games themselves are designed to be addictive and they stimulate the reward and pleasure centres of the brain very effectively... combine this with alcohol or caffeine or nicotine or weed or whatever pairing or combination of those things and that's a real workout for the neurotransmitters! (not in a good way).....Staying off the computer and the booze together might be a good idea to start with and when you feel more comfortable not drinking maybe try a few games and see how you feel? I've found fizzy water a good substitute drink believe it or not and I've just replaced the booze in the glass with fizzy water!..It takes a while for the brain to recalibrate to what 'normal' enjoyment is supposed to feel like though and for the new habits to start settling in.....IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt; .
