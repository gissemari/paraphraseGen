I will not drink today. The temptation so far has been not as difficult as I thought but I'm on sick leave so things are a little easier. I do depend very much on the community out there and I offer all my support to you all as we struggle together to overcome our addiction. Do have a good Friday!

Congratulations on day 4! The temptation is real sometimes but we are stronger than it. I don't think the whispering voices of alcohol will ever leave me alone and I say that as someone who went to the hospital for alcohol-induced liver failure. They still creep up into my head and try to tell me how much fun drinking used to be. But I play it forward and think about terrible hangovers and ER beds. Drinking is not fun voices so stop tempting me; I know better. I hope you have a great Friday hopefully if you are out for sick leave due to being sick you are feeling better :)
