TL;DR: I am not satisfied with how much I do for others and want to do more but I am not lazy in any respect as it is and don't know how to do more. ..I don't know what to put as the title so I didn't worry about it. The last drink I took was in April and I am starting to feel better physically. Actually I've never felt so good in my life. The issue I'm struggling with right now is that I am not doing enough for those around me. I'm negatively motivated and have always done better when I was told what I did wrong. But I haven't done anything to anyone "wrong" since I quit drinking so I am analyzing everything I do day to day and it never seems like I did enough. I don't make a lot of money so I cannot afford to buy much or get people gifts to show gratitude so I am trying to do as much as I can for people especially family and my girlfriend. But no matter what I do I never think its enough and it eats away at me right before I go to sleep about how I should have done more. ..I don't know that I'm looking for advice though if you have some it would be appreciated but I am going to ha e to learn how to be satisfied with what I can do and move on to the next project or act of kindness. I just hope these thoughts go away because I fear it will start to eat away at me and then my relationships I have tried to rebuild in my sobriety.

Sometimes these things have to be approached in a roundabout way.  Although giving back to your family and girlfriend is important to you perhaps doing some volunteer work elsewhere would be the most effective outlet for your desire to contribute...Is there a local animal shelter hospice school or community outreach that is looking for help?  Maybe you could ask your family and girlfriend what organizations that *they* would like you to participate in and so you can do the work on their behalf when they are too busy to contribute...I also want to say that feelings of inadequacy or dissatisfaction are very commonplace for people who are struggling in recovery so just accept that you are going to have these negative emotions no matter how much you do.  Just learn to practice self-acceptance as you learn to practice kindness.  The feelings of being 'less-than' pass in time as long as you are doing your best.
