I messed up big time yesterday after a short period of sobriety. For the past 20 years I haven't been able to get more than a year sober. I have 4 sons 3 of which share in my struggles and it kills me to see them suffer. I am successful  with my career as are my sons but this isn't the legacy I want to leave them. I would like to say I will not drink with you today but I haven't been incredibly successful.

I so get it. Being hard on yourself won't help though. In my case it makes me want to drink more. I'm on my 4th little day and trying to forgive some of the mayhem I've caused. It's difficult but the support here is amazing. Welcome... and IWNDWYT ;). 
Keep trying! I think that's the best gift you can give to your sons. If they see you keep fighting this evil for the rest of your life and getting up no matter how many times you get knock down it will give them hope and strength when they need it most. Be kind to yourself. IWNDWYT.
