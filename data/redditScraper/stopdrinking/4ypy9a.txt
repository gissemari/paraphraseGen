It's now been almost two years since I stopped drinking. My life is infinitely better now than it was then. Here's my attempt to help others understand and perhaps inspire. But this is mostly for me.. .**25 October 2014; The Final Night:** ..On 25 October 2014 two friends of mine got married and I got drunk. Really drunk. Hammered. Blitzed. Wasted. Annihilated. Insert any one of those words that I've used over the years to describe the insane level of drunkenness that I or one of my friends had recently achieved. This night though was different. My then-4-year-old son saw me drunk for the first and last time. Prior to that night he often saw me on a happy sunday of wine-drinking but this night he saw me vomiting in the parking lot of a country club next to my wife's car. He plead to her to explain what was going on; what was wrong with his daddy? He just didn't understand. That night I didn't understand either. ..I don't recall drinking "a lot" at this wedding. I do recall having more than my fair share of wine that evening and I do recall thinking it was a great idea to have a glass of scotch after those many glasses of wine but I don't recall if it was one or several. I recall smoking many cigarettes and a cigar which was a terrible idea and no doubt contributed to my vomiting but that's really inconsequential; I'm here to talk about my drinking. (I've been an on again off again tobacco user over the years but I was in off again mode at this point.) I was at a point in my life where I just couldn't handle the booze like I once did. Over the previous 3+ years I had gotten super fit and lost about 70 pounds and over the previous 10 years I'd gotten 10 years older. The reason I mention this is to say that I was 34 and weighed 180 pounds but that night I was still drinking like I was 24 and weighed 250. My body just couldn't handle the poison that I was pumping into it. ..After emptying the contents of my stomach onto the ground in that parking lot my wife who was used to it got me home and I made my way to our bed. Shortly thereafter I vomited again in bed while I was passed out. When my wife found me moments later she was obviously and rightfully appalled but somehow still compassionate and worried. I was somehow able to strip the bed and put the sheets in the wash but apparently I got angry - really angry - at my wife for offering to help (apparently I had to do this job on my own because it was me that had fucked up and I couldn't accept help for things that were my fault). I use the word apparently because I don't recall this part of the night. Since I have the history of being an angry drunk every so often and since my wife had no reason to make up details that would make my night worse I absolutely believe her. I'd estimate that this all happened at around 11pm. ..The next thing I do remember was waking up on the couch at 3am. Anxious. So anxious. More anxious than I'd ever been in my entire life. I'd always struggled with alcohol induced anxiety but this time was different. I could feel my entire life crushing down upon my chest - I could have very easily died that night. The decision to stop drinking was made right then without a moment's hesitation and I've never looked back. I walked up the stairs and woke my wife up and declared that was the end. It was terribly selfish to wake her up then yes but at that moment I couldn't live for another instant without declaring to her my intentions. And this time it wasn't for just a few weeks or some open ended amount of time where I'd count my drinks or anything like that. I was done drinking. About a year prior to that night I'd emptied much of our liquor cabinet during a similar middle of the night episode of depression and anxiety but this night I finished the job and I've never looked back. ...**Prior to 25 October 2014; My Lifetime of Struggles:** ..For much of my life I've struggled with occasional binge drinking and for much of my adult life I've struggled with whether or not I should or could continue drinking. I can distinctly remember asking my wife on multiple occasions over the years if she thought I should stop. She always left that choice in my hands and I can now see how much wisdom was in her response. The only way this change could have happened was for me to decide for myself and I've since discovered that the only way I was capable of pulling the trigger on this decision was for me to hit rock bottom. ..For my entire adult life I looked forward to parties with glee. For a few days leading up to any kind of social gathering that would involve alcohol I would be giddy thinking about how much fun it would be even though afterwards I'd remember so little of the day. My wife grew accustomed to me driving to events so that I could be a passenger on the way home. I never drank every single day but most nights I'd have a glass of wine or 3 or a beer or three. But every so often one of the aforementioned parties would come and I would get absolutely shit-faced. And each time the anxiety would hit and I would wake up the next day wondering what I had said who I flirted with who I stared at lecherously or who I'd hurt with my loose tongue. I say wondering because I honestly didn't remember and I was too nervous to ask my wife about what had happened. Each time I'd take breaks from drinking intending to  reset  my relationship with alcohol. Looking back I can now ask myself  Reset to what?  The ability to reset something means to go back to some clean slate to some beginning. But for me and alcohol a healthy relationship never existed so a reset was a concept that didn't exist in this case.  ..I can identify now that my last night drinking was the culmination of a very lengthy depressive episode that was around two years in length and which featured several distinct phases and multiple low points that I'll discuss a bit later in this post but let's start at the beginning. ..Without diving into too much detail my childhood wasn't a happy one. I try my hardest not to judge my parents' marriage but in my eyes their marriage is not a good one. After all these years it is apparently something that works for both of them but I would not be satisfied with what they have. Growing up they drank little but each had problems of their own and I am consequently very much the product of long-term emotional abuse. My dad worked too much had serial affairs and loved counting his pennies more than his affections. His prized possession was a classic car and I always felt like I was competing against it for his affection. He lost his own father at a very young age and spent much of his adult life longing for the days of his youth. My mother was the product of two alcoholic parents and was one of seven children. She being second oldest grew up mothering the younger siblings and by the time she had her own children and her own failing marriage went through an immensely long depression. She attempted suicide at least once had a short period of heavy drinking and overall demonstrated little joy in life. I knew nothing of self-advocacy and seldom asked for anything for fear of denial. I stayed in my room often and had few friends. ..Among the happier times of my youth were in my early teens when my parents first mended their marriage and would take vacations by themselves and leave me at home with my older brother. He was a late teen by this time and would have raging parties that I would watch from the periphery and sneak beers even though I found them revolting. I was 12 the first time i remember feeling altered in some way by alcohol. This trend continued for a few years until I was in high school and finally found some friends of my own and I in turn became the host of my own parties over the summer while my parents were away. Alcohol was the center of my social existence by the time I was 16! ..High school continued without major incident I had formed a decent sized group close friends (many of whom continue to be my closest friends in the world) and I got good grades. It followed naturally that I graduated and went away to college. That experience was my first major stumble. ..Moving away to college brought freedom from my oppressive parents. By this time our relationship was simply barely there. I was more or less apathetic towards them as they really did little in the way of support. There were always high expectations to get good grades but rarely any support to achieve those lofty goals. My first semester was ok at best. I was very introverted had a very difficult time making friends and was ironically homesick. Parties were limited to the weekends and raging drunkenness reared its head only seldomly. My second semester was a different story. To combat my loneliness I joined a fraternity. I wasn't permitted to drink during my pledging period but I just stopped going to class so that I could enjoy the company of  friends.  Once I was initiated with about a month left in the semester no longer prohibited from drinking not going to class got combined with drinking at least 5-6 nights per week. I ended with 4 failed courses and somehow squeaked out 1  D.  Basically I wasted a whole boatload of my parents' money. Somehow I convinced my parents to allow me to go away for a third semester pledging to them and to myself that the behavior would change and I would turn things around. Spoiler alert: Nothing changed. One month into the semester I was on the phone with my mother at 6am still awake from the night before unable to sleep with crushing anxiety pledging for her to come and get me; t eded to leave school before I wound up dead. I saw a counselor that morning withdrew from school and returned home completely lost in limbo. ..I was 19 at this time and already bordering on alcoholism. Over the next few months I worked a shitty office temp job waiting for spring to come so I could enroll part time in community college so I could dust myself off a bit. I stayed completely sober for many months going to AA meetings as a spectator with my aunt who'd recently found sobriety (incidentally it was17 years for her in May  16). Things seemed to be going well for me overall around this time. I found my groove in school and started working to my potential started a dating a lovely young lady and was truly happy for what seemed like the first time in my life. ..As I turned 20 21 then 22 alcohol started again dominating my social life. I very rarely got drunk but when I did I found myself becoming verbally abusive. My drinking buddies started becoming more important than the young lady who adored me (it's important to note that she had an abusive alcoholic as a father but I didn't do much work to avoid becoming that) and our relationship fell apart. When she finally after at least a year of trying broke up with me I was devastated. Alcohol became my primary means of calories for a few months and I dropped a bunch of weight. I was depressed and sought counseling for the first time at my college. It was a moderate success. Although I was still very much obsessed with my ex-girlfriend I started seeing another young lady (who would eventually become my wife). Just like that I felt good again. ..I can now recognize that the only way i could self validate was to be in a relationship with someone who adored me. Of course I loathed myself on the inside but as long as I had a woman who loved me it was all ok. Things were never terrible after that. Quite the contrary I/we were mostly happy but there was always a shadow. I always felt like I was hiding something. I was always on again off again with tobacco use both smoking and chewing and I had myself fooled thinking my girlfriend/wife didn't know. I always shamed myself about my sexuality (i'm definitely somewhere on the kink spectrum and still can't identify if I'm bisexual pansexual or heteroflexible but I've only ever been with women) and tried to act purely vanilla. This period of 8 years or so saw frequent drinking but infrequent abuse. Often enough to know it was there but not often enough to cast a dark shadow. ..The next major life event that saw me make changes was an illness to my father. My father is many things and chiefly among those many things is fit and health-conscious. It scared the shit out of me then that when he was 65 he needed a quadruple bypass surgery. At that time I was obese and still used tobacco frequently but made significant lifestyle changes in response to his illness. Over the next few years I managed to complete turn my health around dropping a huge amount of weight getting into fitness as a hobby and mostly shedding tobacco for good. Weight loss and fitness became an obsession. My latest unhealthy obsession. I become scale obsessed health blog obsessed orthorexic anxious and started into a pit of depression. I went through periods of insomnia and turned to wine in the evening to relax to fall asleep xanax before bed to prevent myself from waking up in the middle of the night with anxiety. And this was  healthy  to me. ..Probably the worst thing that happened it that I lost a ton of weight over that two year period and my wife did not. She lost some - she looked great but after unpacking the next sequence of events through marriage counseling she felt jealous that I lost weight faster than she did but was unable to articulate it. Rather than making a meal out of it I'll just come out and say it. I had an affair. Actually a few but one rather serious one. My wife knows all of this; I told her myself because I couldn't live with the decisions I made. In the few years since we've both put a lot of work into our marriage and it's now better than it's ever been thanks in no small part to my sobriety but my sobriety is my focus in this story. Basically I convinced myself that even after losing all of that weight my wife didn't think I was attractive and for the first time in my life I noticed women looking at me. It could have been in my head; I'm not sure. But the fact is that I made some bad decisions. Bad decisions led to more drinking which led to deeper depression. Rinse and repeat. ..The first step back towards a good place came after the low point of my life. November 11 2013. I sat in my car in the garage drunk. My wife and I were separated at this point and I sat there with the car running reading on my phone how long it would take for me to just slip away into nothingness. When I found an article that said that because of today's cars low emissions and catalytic converters it would take not only a very long time but also be painful i snapped back to reality. This was the night previously mentioned when I emptied much of the liquor cabinet and from that night I was sober for about 4 months. At that point I made no attempt to  stay sober  but it took me a few months to even get the urge to have a drink. After that fateful night my wife and I was separated for 5 or so more weeks and for a few months after she came back I didn't drink and didn't think much about it. In February 2014 I had a few beers after a day of skiing and every so often I'd have a few drinks here and a few there. All things considered things were going great! No binging marriage getting better etc. Slowly an occasional binge crept in. July 4th. Then later in July at a wedding. Then a Labor Day Party. After Labor Day I'd  reset.  Didn't drink in September. Then my parents missed my son's birthday party (about a week before my last night of drinking) because my father refused to pay tolls on a highway to get to my house and got lost 4 times. And finally   the last night. ..**Since 26 October 2014; Healing My Mind Body and Soul:** ..In the immediately aftermath I ate a shitload of ice cream. Sure I put on a bunch of weight but I was tackling a bigger problem. I went back to smoking a LOT but again i was tackling a bigger problem. About 2 months after I stopped drinking I gave up the tobacco I'd been using a lot of the last year of my alcoholism but the ice cream continued. My wife and I worked on our relationship. The anxiety was gone. I slept better than I'd ever slept in my life. I was more present during family functions. I was becoming a better father. I was a better listener. I smiled more. I FELT BETTER...After 6 months alcohol free I started working out again. Ice cream became less frequent I started losing weight again. And the feeling better snowballed. The more I felt better physically the better I felt mentally. The better I felt mentally the better I felt emotionally. My physical mental and emotional health were at lifetime highs...Let me rephrase that. My physical mental and emotional health ARE at lifetime highs. I may not be quite as fit and thin as I was before my depressive bout took its full grip upon me but I'm getting stronger every day in more ways than just my muscles and I'm doing it without obsessiveness about my behaviors. I'm less prone to self-critique these days and I've finally allowed myself to give award credit for my own accomplishments. It's a nice feeling. And I'm proud today to share. For the first time in my life I treat myself gently I practice calmness and patience on a regular basis and I'm the best overall version of myself to date. ..One of my hardest challenges came just over a year ago. On 26 June 2015 an old friend of mine who had alcohol struggles himself chose to end his own life. I found out after the fact that this wasn't his first attempt. About 10 years ago he was on kidney dialysis because of a failed attempt involving the consumption of antifreeze. He told me at the time that it was kidney failure of an unspecified cause and I simply didn't inquire in any more detail. His successful attempt came after years of dedicated service to other survivors of suicide but ultimately the darkness consumed him. The day after his death many friends got together and mourned together. Many drank; I didn't. If I ever had the excuse to have a drink it would have been that day but the memory of my friend and his struggles with alcohol drove me to stay sober. I stayed sober for him that day but I also stayed sober for me and I've stayed sober FOR ME every day since October 262014 and have no end to that streak in sight. ..If you're still reading thanks for sticking with me. I hope some of you can gain something positive or relate in some way to my story. Mostly it feel nice to get this all out of my head and into the universe. Life is wonderful. .

Thank you for sharing all of this - I love how you broke it into three distinct sections!..I can relate to a lot of what you wrote - my childhood has similarities. I recall with great detail the eve and day of my decision to stop drinking including letting my husband know. I asked him what he recalls of it and it surprised me when I questioned him recently about it that he barely remembers anything except that I had told him I was knocking it on the head and he thought that'd be a good idea. I love that you describe the aftermath of your drinking - I too ramped up my exercise several months into sobriety I'd taken things pretty easy on myself until then and decided it was time to spread my wings a bit and start practicing discipline...My condolences for the loss of your friend. I lost a family member to alcohol earlier this year and it was thankfully a dry wake at the request of their sons. It reminded me what a gift my life is now that I have it back.
This is a really powerful post you've written thank you for writing it...I can relate to quite a few things in here - the unhappy childhood the binge drinking. It's funny that I never really question aspects of my drinking history until I read the same thing in someone else's story. I too had centered my entire social life around alcohol from the age of 15 or 16. Before that I had pretty healthy pasttimes. I'm in the early days now thinking about how I can restructure my entire life - relationships are a big part of it - so I can keep myself sober. Though I'm kind of tied down at the moment I just really want to start doing the work of sobriety. Today I'm just not drinking but I know there's a whole lot more to come. ..Also I'm sorry to hear about your friend. Despite the sadness you did incredibly well to stay away from alcohol and to keep going. I'm sure your friend would want you to be happy and would be proud of your progress...I wish you all the best for your continued growth and happiness. 
Congrats on almost 2 years! I can relate with several parts of your story particularly alcohol in the family and sometimes it just helps to know that we're not alone. Thank you for sharing this story. You must be very proud of how far you have come :).

i came across your post...thank you for sharing your story...there are many thing that i can relate to here. i am only just barely climbing out of the hole myself and have a lot of work to do...this was inspiring. again thank you.
Really enjoyed reading ur writing. I can relate to so much big and small details the ups and the downs the lows that finally made me say im truly done the past getting reflected in the present. The past getting healed in the present...I lost the person i love most to suicide my dad 2.75 years ago. I stay sober for him and live in truth in his honor. Thank u for sharing ur experience with that as well. It can be hard to stay sober thru the dark times whether its grief or our own pain...which really are one and the same...I sense a lot of strength wisdom and depth in these reflections. 
A lot of that was so close to my experiences as to be spooky. I also have an incredible wife who never once told me what I ought to do but supported me because she had faith that I would eventually see my own way out. Took eleven years of her support. We're two lucky buggers mate that's for sure.
Ice cream was my savior too! :)

A compelling post very honest and very well written. My compliments on your writing style.  ..Can I ask you to elaborate a little on HOW you have managed to make this progress in your recovery? Did you return to AA or seek any type of professional assistance?
Thanks for sharing your story.  I found it to be very inspirational.
&gt; Each time I'd take breaks from drinking intending to  reset  my relationship with alcohol. Looking back I can now ask myself  Reset to what?  The ability to reset something means to go back to some clean slate to some beginning. But for me and alcohol a healthy relationship never existed so a reset was a concept that didn't exist in this case...This is a profound insight stated beautifully and something I am coming to understand.
