Good Morning/Afternoon!    .      .*Theme*: Stick with it..**"Don't quit.  Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion  .    [Muhammad Ali] (http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/m/muhammadal148629.html)**  .   .*What I get from it*: Those first few weekends of sobriety were the toughest for me.  All I knew was drinking so I didn't know what to do with myself.  I sat inside playing videogames watching netflix and reading posts on SD (not quite the training regimen Mr. Ali was referring too but I'm not going for a perfect analogy).  I worried that it would always be this way.  I've since begun filling my weekends with more fulfilling and sociable activities (although its a struggle during winter).  Toughing it out during those first weeks was so worth it but it was a leap of faith to believe that my drinking could be replaced by something positive.    .Right now my "suffering" is making amends so I can be happy and sober at the same time.  I tend to hold stuff in so the idea of having sincere conversations with friends and family is horrifying but I want what's on the other side of those amends.            .Have a great Friday!

Happy Friday! You're amazing!
   
Some people succeed because they did the thing longer than most people not because of talent or money or good parents or whatever. The best example was when I did a show a about 4 years ago. There was that singer who played before me and was boring people. Then I came and did so much better. She stuck to it and finally succeeded while I stopped and didn't even though I was better and consider myself more talented...I didn't want to succeed because it was just a hobby for me but I saw the power of not quitting. And that situation didn't happen once but twice!
I want it too. See you on the other side /u/larry_sellers
