So I was not drinking for a year almost on holiday(s) I drank but lets say out of 365 days I was sober for 350.  I am SO grateful for that.  I am so grateful for this group.  Since the one year mark I have had weekends where I have had drinks.  Nothing crazy *(I am re-reading this before I submit it and I am totally lying this past weekend we had some time with friends that were in town I drank with ease took a full DAY to get over my hangover - felt horrible missed a volunteer shift felt guilt - that uncertainty of* ***OH SHT... WHAT DID I SAY WHAT DID I DO DID I TEXT DID I POST ANYTHING???****).*  ..My H still full on drinks and is **only** too happy to have me partaking with him again.  I will not drink during the week and have stuck by that.  ..NOW... last night.  I am scrambling to get ready for a sports event away with my kids H is travelling for work I am stressed etc.  **I have wine in the fridge.**  I wanted a glass.  SO bad.  I wanted that escape why not no one would really know and I would just go to bed after... WELL.  **I played it forward** continued to do my laundry **and did not drink.**  I did wake up to a call at 3 am though.  First thought was... well not a good one.  It was my H who needed his passport brought to him.  He was at the airport (20 mins from us) and had been travelling inter country and now had to go across the border totally forgot that he did not have it with him.  IF I had had that wine it would not have been possible (cause we know that only one glass would not have been just one glass).  ..Not too sure why I needed to post this other than to say this morning although I am very sluggish I am SO happy.  I stayed true my children did not see me '*saucy*' I got the passport to my H (and snuck in a little kiss) made it to the office functional here and almost ready to spend a weekend with a bunch of kids at a hotel with some SUPER annoying sports Moms.  The weekend should be interesting. Ha ha BUT as much as I may want to I WILL NOT DRINK with you TODAY and (because I probably won't get a chance to post) TOMORROW.  ..Keep strong keep posting keep reading.  It really helps.

Good for you for playing it forward and not drinking.  Being able to take your H his passport and being present for your children are even more reasons to not drink! Congrats on being sober for so long! I really do not know how many days but it is alot! IWNDWYT
