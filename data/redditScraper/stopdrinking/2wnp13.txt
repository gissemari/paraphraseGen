http://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonselk/2013/04/15/habit-formation-the-21-day-myth/..This past week with all the snow and ice I definitely hit what this article calls a "fight through" phase..It worried me about relapse and made me feel like something must be really wrong if I was "white knuckling" after such a successful honey moon phase.. .This article lays out three phases..*Honeymoon*;.*The Fight Through*;.*Second Nature*;..It also describes how one could get to "the second nature" phase but a change of circumstances can set them back to the fight though phase..My favourite part it mentions how going trough a few fight throughs will bring you back up to the second nature phase.. .That's a nice way to look at it..After a ragged week it is as if magically today I am back to having no desire to drink at all and feel perfectly comfortable in my sober body...I am not even jonesin' for sweets. Man oh man..Day 66 through 69 them was devil numbers hahaha.
