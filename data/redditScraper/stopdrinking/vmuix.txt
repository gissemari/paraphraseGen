Well here I am... 4 days away from my 'one month' milestone and I am proud and excited.  I am learning A LOT about myself and sobriety thus far hasn't all been a pink cloudy cake walk.  ..I am learning that psychologically my brain wants alcohol to deal with frustration anger and disappointment.  There is one trigger in particular that causes the strongest pangs and the strongest feelings of anxiety and disappointment and that is yes a guy in my life.  He's been in and out of my life for approximately 4 years.  I'm going to say at this stage that I think I may be addicted to the idea of him or clinging to his fading presence in my life more so than I am to alcohol or cigarettes right now.  My downward spiral the last 6-9 months was partially due to me leaning on the bottle because I was having a horrible time dealing with his inconsistent behaviour and his back and forthing with me.  He's a Mr. All-Talk and No-Action type.  It has caused me great stress and I have allowed it to for way too long!  I used to be in love with this man or the idea of him but have come to a very painful realization that he is toxic and unhealthy for me.  He's not cruel or abusive he just won't give me the love that I deserve but won't let me off the hook either.  Basically he's up and down present then gone -- and the roller-coaster experiences with him has made me drink in the past and really makes me want to drink some days in the last month as well.  I have not given in though but the intensity of this grief and frustration has been overwhelming and all-consuming some nights...I have noticed that anytime I get an email from him (he lives overseas -- thank God) or anytime he does not respond in a timely manner to an email from me I plummet into a pit of depression and sadness and I want to drown my sorrows with wine.  The temptation of relapse is the strongest when he is on my mind or has been in contact.  Last night was one of those nights so I put IKEA furniture together for hours in my livingroom crying all over the manuals.  I did not drink.  But I did think that this has to stop and come to an end already.  I came to a very painful realization that I have to completely cut off all contact with this man so that I can maintain my sanity and sobriety.  He knows that I have struggled with drinking and knows that I have also stopped.  He also knows that his actions have caused me a lot of heartache and confusion.  I have to walk away from him.  Should I flat out explain my feelings and actions to him in an email or just slowly fade away?  Do I explain that I feel that my sobriety is being compromised by the stress that his behaviour causes me or do I just quietly walk away with my sanity intact?..Thank you for being here gang.  I look forward to posting on my one month this weekend.  I couldn't have done it without all of the support here at r/stopdrinking.

Hi IChoseLifeToo...It sounds like you have actually thought this through pretty rationally and have made a wise decision.  (It's all up to you and that's only my opinion.)  ..In my experience love/sex relationships are very often a major part of what people need to deal with in early sobriety.  That's both my own experience and it's what I've heard about from lots of other people mostly in AA.  So if you don't know it already at least know that you are far from being alone in having strong feelings like this.  (People with long-term sobriety can certainly have these issues too.)..As far as staying sober I have some thoughts for you about all of this.  This might seem like a funny way to put it but I hope it makes a point that I think is really important...1. If you stick to the decision to end the relationship **just don't take that first drink.**..2. If you find yourself still "stuck"... undecided or whatever you want to call it... with a relationship that apparently isn't really adding much if anything to your life **just don't take that first drink.**..3.  If for some reason you decide to stay in this situation with the guy **just don't take that first drink.**..4.  If you're happy lonely horny sad angry thrilled or whatever **just don't take that first drink.**..Put your sobriety ahead of any relationship (sexual business friendship etc.) because if you lose you're sobriety you'll very likely lose or destroy those relationships anyway...As for what to tell him I would tell him any number of things about why the relationship isn't working from your perspective but I would leave out the issue of your situation with alcohol.  Whether or not you drink is your responsibility even if the stress you feel from the relationship has preceeded your drinking at times...As I think you already know there's a lot of support here at /r/stopdrinking and at meetings.  I also wish for you a better relationship with someone who treats you better!  Also that is more likely to develop after a person gets a really firm footing in sobriety...I hope some of that was helpful.  And by the way I lost my sobriety more times than I can count (mostly before AA) due to my feelings relating to relationship problems.  So I think I know how earthshaking this stuff can feel.  I had to be told that we still can choose not to drink.
You have to end the relationship.  You can't say open ended things like "*Right now* I think we can't see each other."  You have to be definitive. "I am ending this relationship for good and moving on."  Leaving things open will only cause you more heartache and will stand in the way of your recovery.  It's bad for the soul.  You have to completely close the door leaving no doubt in your mind or his...My advice:  Write him a long email explaining your feelings and the reasons you don't want to see him anymore.  Don't send it right away wait a week.  Re-read it.  Edit it.  Get comfortable with it. Accept it.  Then send it.  And start a new chapter in your life.
Hello .I find myself in the exact same position with a guy ive been in love with for years and years. Your post is pretty parallel to my situation to. ..I also use alcohol as a way to cope with anger and sadness and a way to go to sleep but the morning after the problem is still there and im just hungover. ..i sent this guy a message breaking off contact but the post below about waiting a week and then re-reading/re-editing i would agree with. although thats not what i did. ..for me i realized that a lot of people dont subscribe to the idea of unconditional love. there love requires some kind of conditions that people cant live up to. but out there is someone who will be incredibly in love with you......so drop whomever it is that makes you sob yourself to sleep cause if they take you for granted then they really dont deserve you. ..(i know 20billion times easier said then done)..im 23 female sober for several days and willing to work this out with you because are problems are alike feel free to message me if you want. ..take care
i guess my post got deleted that sucks sorry if i offended anyone.. i wish you the best of luck i can sympathize. 
I believe that for myself I was codependent before I was alcoholic. I have struggled with men for a long time because I always NEEDED them and would get obsessive about them...Do the adult thing. Tell him what you need and how you feel. I had to do the same thing with a friend in the program just last week. He was weighing too heavily on my sobriety and I was feeling overwhelmed by his presence in my life. So I cut him out...I need my sobriety. I have to let things go that no longer serve in my journey to lead a sober useful life. ..You're doing the right thing.
When I stopped drinking I had just starting seeing a guy that I had dated in high school. He was trying to decide if he should stay in the area move out of state yada yada... ..I had to lay my cards on the table. I told him that I was making a commitment to myself and if he couldn't support that commitment 100% he needed to see himself out. And he left. I cried... But I didn't drink. ..Right now you need to put your commitment to sobriety first.  I think that you need to cut ties with this guy as soon as you can. There will be other guys and you will find one that will love you sober and support you 100%.
tell him its done cut it off now. the more you drag it out the more you are dragging yourself through the mud. If you are an alcoholic you suffer from a physical reaction (allergy) to alcohol. Once you put it into your body you must continue to drink to satisfy the craving or you will go nuts. Don't take that first drink or you won't stop!! You also suffer from a mental obseSsion which causes mental blankspots where no matter the consequenses or how strong your convictions in the blink of an eye you will drink and most times don't know why you picked up. The only way to relieve this is through working the steps. if yoou don't already i highly suggest you get a sponsor and start on the steps imediatly. I'm not trying to be mean when i say this but i know it to be true if you do not work through the steps you WILL drink again. that is why they are there if you want sobriety thats how to achieve it. And btw fuck that dude you're much too good for that!! best of luck babe!
and its not as easy as just don't take that first drink. No offense to anybody but it never says that in the big book for a reason. because if it was a choice to just not take that first drink none of us would need this program because we could all control our drinking. 2 things make up an alcoholic: physical allergy mental obsession. don't forget about the mental obsession it leaves you with NO CHOICE. there is no thinking through the drink. thats why the steps are there to relieve you of this mental obsession
Not worth a relapse. Tell him you've got higher priorities and set up a filter that sends any e-mail from him straight to trash.
&gt; clinging to his fading presence..Do it cold turkey like you did alcohol. You don't owe him an explanation unless you just feel like you have do. But if you do that block his e-mails and change your e-mail address. Then get social so you don't spend hours on the computer machine--church AA sports judo class gym--it doesn't make any difference just get out of the house and around healthy non-toxic people...BTW you are very articulate and that is a great phrase "clinging to his fading presence". Are you a writer by chance?.
Love addiction has nothing to do with love.
