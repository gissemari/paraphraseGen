Going through the first real job search since sober no good news bringing back thoughts of just having a beer to relax.

I'm in the same boat tonight job search and everything. Message me if you want..
Hey other person for messaged I am not too sure why your message is hiding.  
Just "a" beer? I know how those thoughts go for me anyways. When I indulge that I'm either miserable because I want more or I go get more and then I'm miserable because I got more and caused problems.  ...Whoa congrats on 217 days by the way! That's awesome!  ...I hope some good news turns up for you.  ...IWNDWYT
