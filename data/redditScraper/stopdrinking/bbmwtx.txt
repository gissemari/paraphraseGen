I have been using alcohol for coping for over 2 decades. I run have supportive family and friends and other health options....but I prefer to numb with alcohol.  I have been sober for 2 months and 13 days.  The last 24 hours have been a bit of a dumpster fire....just one thing after another.  And man did I want to tune that shit out and mainline some wine.  But I didn't. And what's better what's fucking amazing is I DIDNT HAVE TO.  I was free from that lie.  I knew it wouldn't help I knew I would regret it and feel horrible.  And I was right.  Reminding myself that I don't HAVE to drink to cope made a world of difference.  And it feels amazing.  I went to bed last night in peace and woke this morning feeling empowered.  ..Happy Wednesday all IWNDWYT

Congrats on resisting the urge; that's huge! I hold on to dear life during the hard times and it helps to train me to deal with challenges sober. I'm better at it every time and I think u will be too! I will not drink with you today my friend.
Thanks man. I really needed to hear this today. I had a good stretch going then just went crazy these past two days. So I know I can and I want sobriety. Thanks for the encouragement. I'm not the only one. I am staying sober with you today! Peace.
