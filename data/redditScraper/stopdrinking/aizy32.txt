I'm working a sobriety program and did a really enlightening exercise yesterday. I'm sharing in hopes that it will help others who are struggling. ..The idea is simple: list out your top ten core values with a simple explanation of each. Once this is done evaluate the effect that your problem drinking has on this core value. ..Working through this exercise really crystalized the fact that alcohol runs in direct opposition to everything I hold sacred. For all these years I've been sacrificing my own core values at the altar of a short buzz. I've included the results of this exercise below as an example. I hope others find this helpful. ..\--..CORE VALUES: ..* **Family** \- In the end only two things matter: who you loved and who loved you. .* **Health** \- Your body is a vessel; a vehicle to fulfill your dreams. If you don't take care of it where are you going to live?.* **Passion** \- Nurture the things that ignite you both big and small. They hold the secret to lasting happiness big results and a life full of meaning.  .* **Tenaciousness** \- Be relentless and uncompromising in the pursuit of an impactful life. .* **Curiosity** \- Never stop learning. There is such a thing as a good question. If you don't understand something well enough to teach it you don't really understand it. .* **Accountability -** do what you say you're going to do when you say you're going to do it. You are solely responsible for the outcomes you produce. No excuses. .* **Emotional Intelligence** \- Be mindful expressive and in control of your own emotions. Practice empathy judiciousness and acknowledgment with others'..* **Self-reliance** \- No one is responsible for you but you. Nothing is free. If you really want something be prepared to work your ass off for it. .* **Integrity** \- Say what you mean. Mean what you say. Honor your word. No exceptions. .* **Workmanship -** Strive to be the best at whatever you're doing no matter how small. Details matter.  ..THE ALCOHOL EFFECT..* **Family** \- Drinking makes me a shittier father and husband.* **Health** \- Drinking destroys my body and mind.* **Passion** \- Drinking dulls my passion and makes me wallow in self-pity and negativity. .* **Tenaciousness** \- Drinking saps my energy and leaves me highly unmotivated. Life feels like survival instead of an exciting pursuit. .* **Curiosity** \- Drinking makes me too tired to care about anything except getting through the day and when I'm going to have my next drink..* **Accountability -** Drinking makes me less likely to follow through on my word.* **Emotional Intelligence** \- Drinking makes my emotions out of control and kills all empathy and patience for others..* **Self-reliance** \- Drinking ensures I will never secure financial independence for my family. .* **Integrity** \- Drinking makes me say things I don't mean and mean things I don't say.* **Workmanship -** Drinking makes me sloppy

Great Share !  Thanks!
I absolutely love this!!!!! IWNDWYT
May I ask what program you are doing?
This is a great exercise.  I realize I don't know what my core values really are and yours are inspiring.  Looks like I have some thinking to do and lists to make.  Thanks for sharing this.
well said. yeah four hours of sitting in my cozy beerhole saying fudge the world was not getting me anywhere at all.
Thank you for sharing. I did a very similar exercise while at inpatient rehab and it really helped me see just how incongruous alcohol was with the way I wanted to live my life going forward.
