Guys I hate drinking. To start off I'm 23 years old...I've quit multiple times for months at a time the longest being 4 months. This isn't an achievement it's actually the focal point of my questioning: am I going to be this way forever?..The first time I drank was when I was 16 and I got alcohol poisoning. My friends tried to hide the handle of Captain Morgan from me and I'm not one who likes to be barred for anything so when I found the bottle I drank myself to oblivion worrying that they'd find out I drank and hide it again...This was the first time I drank...At that point I didn't continually drink I actually left it alone until after I got out of Basic Training for the U.S. Army and the people all around me normalized drinking (and cigarette smoking at that at this point I've been cigarette free for a month and that's the longest since I started when I was 18. Not a brag just a perspective on my experience with addiction) I moved to a major college party town which ended up being the worst choice of my life so far and my addiction ramped up hardcore...During the year in said party-town I drank every day to the point where I was drinking about a 30 pack of beer a day for close to 6 months. Starting at about 7:30am I'd drink the strongest 40oz available and fill my day being intoxicated. I thought it changed me from the nerdy socially guy I used to be but it really was a useless mask and when I took the drunk mask off I was more socially awkward than before with my new sense of "wisdom" (which was in reality off-putting opinions on the way people live their life not fun for anybody)..Look I don't really know what's wrong with my mind anymore. When I grew up I was a straight-A student over-achieving in fear of being not the best of the best. Seriously I was so "competitive" and hopeful that I wouldn't fall behind in anything that it literally made me sick to my stomach to not be in first place in anything I put my mind to...I still have that mindset I think it's deep ingrained within my psyche but I've lost the ability to compete. When I get stressed now I get (UNGROUNDED) thoughts of ending it all and giving up. I want what I used to want but I've lost the drive to change my position because of how easily accessible escape through substances has become since I became of legal age. I wake up every day telling myself "I cannot do X X X anymore" and it never works I give up faster the sooner I say that...It seems the more I want to be sober the further I fall into this trap and I don't want to die to alcoholism. I want to rescue the spirit I used to have  I want to love myself and believe in myself but all I see myself as is a failure to my sober religious family and a failure to the kid I used to be who wanted the whole world...I don't have a stable home I just bought a shitty car after being carless for 2 years and I took on a job offer that promises a lot as the "light at the end of the tunnel" (high ticket sales) but I seem to have lost the self-confidence I once had. People tell me "you're doing good for your age" and I only feel patronized...I want to stop all substance usage I want to go through the neurotic worries I had when I was younger without alcohol instead of the realistic worries I have of ruining any possibility I have to succeed and become something besides a burnout before I end up six feet under...I need help I've gone to AA meetings multiple times and the people I met there feel disillusioned to me people who know what's going on with their mind but instead of acknowledging it as a part of their real lives they demonize it and refuse to communicate with those who are still suffering. I've tried finding sponsors I've got friends who have become sober and the ones I've met seem to fall into a persona of being a superior person because they've figured out how to keep this substance out of their body for the time being of course (many have relapsed after displaying this persona yet give no acknowledgement to how they treated me during their "sobriety")..I guess the real bottom line is I feel alone. There are people around me who are suffering and I feel the pain they do but I've got literally nothing to connect to nothing to ground me and keep me in check on why I want to be sober in the first place...I fear that if I can't get a grasp on my self-control I'll end up dying in a pathetic way and being a general disappointment to everyone who believed I can be something. I don't know how to control myself or my addiction and I'm running out of places to look. Any advice please?

Im certain others will chime in as I dont really have specific advice...vut you have a community here and everyone has been pure awesome. I have found it to be a mistake comparing my life to others. Whats adnormal avout not wanting to kill your brain (among other things). You shouldnt be expected to poison yourself and it is no ones business why. Take it slow and maybe avoid situations where you may feel pressured real or implied. And stop by here :) I read here everyday and it has been encouraging. Not going to drink with you
Glad you're here.  Sorry to hear about your struggles...More importantly Congratulations for Noticing what's going one and wanting it to be different!..Here's the good news- it's not about perfection not self-control.  Those attributes can be useful in certain settings but they're not useful with respect to alcohol.  That's the trap my mind sets for me.  ..When I accepted that I could start getting better.  ..You write "I feel alone".  You're not. We're here.  More importantly there are a lot of resources (free) that help...I first spoke with a counselor.  She recommended AA meetings.  I went got tools resources support and fellowship.  I've not looked back!..You don't have to be "Perfect".  Here's a comment I shared just a moment ago about 'perfection'.  ..Ah!   Perfection  that seemingly noble descriptor used by my lying mind.  There are many here among us especially me who have been held prisoner by my mind to that elusive grail: *Perfection* - also appearing often in the guise of the  Lord of Procrastination ...I broke these chains of bondage by getting a simple concept through my thick head   (1) Humans are NOT perfect and (2) I don't have to be  perfect  to be **Successful**...I don't know if you drive an automobile but I and most people I know do.  I will **never** drive perfectly and no human ever will.  I often and for many many years have driven **Successfully**...If my goal is to drive  perfectly  it's not achievable.  If I'm going on a level straightaway possibly miles into the horizon if I in combination with my machine were  perfect  I would set the steering wheel in one position and not move it at all until I reached a curve in the road.  Yet I cannot nor can anyone else do that simple thing.  I will make seemingly small adjustments to the steering wheel.  I tiny nudge left a slight nudge right.  I'm constantly doing that.  Because I'm not perfect and *neither is the system in which I'm operating*!  I cannot drive  perfectly  on a perfectly flat and straight roadway.  I however may drive  Successfully !  Success being stay within the lines on my right and left.  ..I don't need to be  perfect  at *not drinking*; I want to be  Successful  in Sober Living.  I want to keep it  between the lines' I want to  avoid a crash' I don't want my  system to break'.  I can be successful without being perfect...When my mind tells me  you can't be perfect at that! .  I agree.   Yes I will not be perfect.  But screw you lying mind I am and will continue to be Successful!.
I was browsing these forums to get some perspective on other people's paths as to what is working for them what hasn't and being realistic / true to myself and my significant other. ..What you wrote connected with me. I fell into similar circumstances. But I have always felt alone. I like being alone. I know that I can beat this alone. However I know that it won't be easy that route and likely be a short lived 'win'. So I am on here. To look for a different kind of support. Maybe writing about it will help. Maybe it won't. I have tried to quit several times before with varying levels of success. ..But I am not ready to end up like my father or his father. Not that their bad people. In fact they are very high level functioning alcoholics and proud of it too. Like I once was. But that isn't the mentality I want to pass on to the children I hope to have one day. ..So here I am. I really appreciate your honesty on here. I think maybe part of your problem really might steam in your self worth. I know my drinking is directly tied to how things are going for me and that it can be vicious cycle. When I have money in my pocket and work is going well I don't feel like getting obliterated I feel like rolling thru like James Bond. But when I am feeling down on myself or defeated I want the comfortable numb bliss that I know is in the bottom of the bottle. ..I relate a lot more with 'characters' then people I meet in real life. Fictional persona's like Dr. House and Sherlock Holmes. When I am consumed by work passion or competition I don't feel like drinking. I feel alive and I don't want the alcohol to numb that...We are born alone and die alone. Feeling alone is a state of mind. Reading looking for spiritual experiences feeling alive. Constantly reminders of what I want my life to be filled with vs. focusing on trying to keep one thing out. ..Good luck on your journey and I hope we both find what we are looking for here.
