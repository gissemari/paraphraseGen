I'm a regular at /r/cripplingalcoholism. I've been an alcoholic for about 5 years now (just turned 27). I drink about a case a day and some change. A bottle of tequila on paydays. ..Last Monday school started again and I got absolutely blackout hammered the night before due to trying to deal with my brother's recent death (died at 29 from cancer on August 31st). I seriously thought I was going to have a seizure in class couldn't even hold a pencil due to my shakes. Had to go to the bathroom 3 times in an hour long class to puke. At this point I realized that I'm on the verge of becoming a non-fuctional alcoholic. I stopped Tuesday cold turkey. My blood pressure sky rocketed insomnia was terrible etc. I got through that. Last night I fell off the wagon after a shitty day at work. I drank a 6 pack 2 40's another beer and 2 glasses of wine. Woke up hungover as fuck and realized how fucking weak and stupid I am. In those 3 sober days I experienced so much clarity in my mind. I felt like my IQ had risen 50 points. The constant fog was lifted. It was amazing. Now tonight I didn't drink any. My shakes have returned. My brain is itching so bad for some alcohol right now. Obviously I want to continue to try to quit but it's probably going to be the biggest struggle I've ever faced. I ordered the book on the sidebar of this subreddit off amazon tonight. I will read it and hoping it's half as helpful as all you make it out to be. I know I need years of therapy/drugs to combat my inner demons (something I truly believe I'm not strong enough to do nor can I afford). So I guess what I'm asking someone in here is what drove you to be an alcoholic and what filled the void that you were once filling with alcohol after you stopped drinking? I cut myself sometimes too but obviously that's not a healthy alternative. I have post traumatic stress disorder. If anyone here suffers from it and has successfully recovered from alcoholism I would love your input especially.

First off I'm really sorry for your loss.  29 is way too goddamn young...Second I know what you mean about the inner demons.  Years of drinking has buried them really deep and I am fairly sure that my journey into sobriety is going to cause a lot of soul-searching that I'm deeply afraid of.  I know I've been drinking to fall asleep.  I know I've been drinking to reduce my anxiety.  I know I've been drinking so that I don't have to face the condition my life is in...I'm putting things into baby steps and shorter goals...1) Lose weight..2) Become social again..3) Wake up earlier and become productive at my job...4)Get my health back.  I used to rock climb 5.12 and I used to through-hike multi-hundred mile trails.  Now I start sweating when i mow the lawn...5)Get a psychiatrist that does talk therapy and see if I can't unwind the snakes nest of demons deep down in my subconscious...What do I hope to fill the void I've been filling with alcohol?  Life.  Actively living for myself.  Learning to take care of my own life as an adult.  I went to an Ivy League College graduated magna while working 40 hours a week managing people twice my age I own a house and at no point do i feel like a functional adult.  I'm trying to fix it.  I'm up right now pouring over this subreddit and communicating instead of drinking despite the anxiety headache and insomnia.  I figure we're all in this together.
