I have found myself struggling with almost overwhelming anxiety and sadness in the past few days. I made it through a party I was dreading yesterday but had SO much anxiety beforehand I almost couldn't go- it was a party at my in-laws that my SO's sister from out of town was throwing so I felt obligated to go. My SO had no idea I was not having fun and was surprised when I told hi. I wanted to go home- since he was drinking he was oblivious to my needs. He still doesn't get it this morning. I am beyond mad at him for choosing himself over me again. We discussed my anxiety about the party ahead of time he promised if I wanted to go we would- then when it came down to it he ignored me. I don't want to ruin our holiday but I'm not sure If I can be with someone who picks and chooses when my sobriety and my feelings works for them. Sorry- just needed to vent. Hope all of you make it through the Christmas holiday and can experience the beauty of the season without alcohol! IWDWYT.

I am so sorry that you experienced this. Normies really don't understand what we go through in our minds...I won't spend any time with any family members who stress me out or bring up negative feelings this holiday. I'm not obligated to anyone except my young children and myself. My family will live without me there.
I'm glad you made it through the day friend.     my first Christmas was difficult also but this year I have so much more of the clarity and peace of mind I allowed myself to gain by choosing sobriety it was all worth it.  The further I went the more clarity I gained- over my choices my friends my circumstances.. it's a real blessing.  Hard at first but a real blessing.  Hang in there!  I'm not drinking with you.
