It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-----------------------------------------..**Struggle:** Recently I have been haunted by regret over how much time I spent being drunk during a period of more than twenty years. Time is the most precious resource we have and I have wasted so much of mine. That fact is a bitter pill to swallow...**Triumph:** Recently I bought a pair of cute Mary Jane shoes. You have no idea how wonderful this is for me. For the past few years I have been forced (by a non-healing wound on my left foot) to wear a pair of hideous heavy orthopedic shoes that look like something Frankenstein's monster would have worn on his feet. They are so ugly that I actually wept the first time I saw them. ..The worst part was that while I was hoping nobody would notice that I was wearing ugly shoes people would constantly comment on them. I once wore them to a party and told myself beforehand  Don't be self-conscious. No one will notice.  But when I walked into the party a woman I knew said loudly  Mary those are SOME shoes you're wearing  and then EVERY SINGLE PERSON in the room immediately looked at my feet...But then a few days ago I found a great footwear shop and a pair of cute shoes that I can actually wear despite my foot problem and now when I go out I no longer feel like a freak from a circus sideshow. ..**General:** "Never under any circumstances take a sleeping pill and a laxative on the same night."

Yay!  Congrats on your shoes Mary!  That's totally awesome.  Feeling comfortable and cute makes such a huge difference on my whole attitude and experience of a day. ..**Triumph:** I found a tiny hole in my favorite old today and stitched up before it became a problem. I went off to work feeling sharp by comfy. Similarly I tried to put on my favorite new rain jacket in the car (never ends well) and heard a short loud ripping noise.  I remembered when I got home and found the small tear in the armpit and fixed it.  I love these little sober super powers.  These sorts of things I would have put off until they became larger problems.  ..**Struggle:** I just can't seem to leave work at work.  Especially in the middle of the night.  I obsess over any mistakes or delayed schedules end up thinking of worst case scenarios or just plain dream about doing work which is **so** freakin' lame.  I used some meditation tools last night and that helped some.  It might be worse at the moment since I'm sick and my mind goes a bit wonky when fighting off the plague but I know it's a recurring issue that I need to address.  ..**General:** I just read that a snail can sleep for three years.  This makes me think of gardening.  I am looking forward to getting back into the soil.
Isn't it crazy how one small change in your case shoes make SUCH a difference? ..Triumph: coming up on one week fully sober and I'm feeling a bit clearer minded. I am going to start a new parttime job on top of my fulltime job which will hopefully transfer into a fulltime position. This will allow me to shift my whole career and make a lot more money to open up even more travel. I am excited for what is to come...struggle: I am currently moving house and trying to lose weight and even though I haven't drank anything my energy levels are pretty low. I am pretty tired and my new house is a mess of trash and boxes but hopefully everything will get pretty and come together soon!..general: Hopefully things will be coming together for me. I have a big holiday coming up (Chinese New year living abroad comes with some fun holidays!) which will allow me to reset and really nest into my new space.
Hi I understand your pain. Shoes are a personal favorite of mine. Hopefully you can find some more for your feet. Don't give up! If you found one pair out there you know there's more...Triumph: last night after a demoralizing day at work I wanted to stop for my comfort food and wine at a local restaurant and just forget the day..I stopped at a Moe's restaurant instead ate too much of a veggie burrito and chips along with orange flavored diet coke and headed home to bath bed and reading this thread. ..Struggle: I despise my boss. Nuff said. ..General: I discovered I have Monday off for MLK day. I wasn't expecting that but super happy about it!
So I feel I've had many triumphs this week so here goes...Triumph: After lots of reading and hard self reflection work I've managed to come out the other side of a long period of depression and debilitating guilt...I realised something so important that has genuinely changed the way I see the world. First off: I have my own power and agency in any situation. I get to choose how I do things...Secondly I cannot choose how people react or think about me. Obvious right? But sometime this week it just clicked. ..Whatever I do good or bad I can own that but if people continually want to pull me down or want me to perpetually guilty - then that's their thing not mine...I can make amends and apologise but I cannot give them my whole self to placate their needs. ..This also suddenly made me feel really capable at work. I realised that my anxiety would tell me - oh I can't do this or what if it goes wrong? But now I think: I can do this and it is goes wrong I can't control the other persons reaction. I can just make the appropriate changes etc. ..Talk about a revelation. I suddenly feel utterly powerful...Struggle: Twinges or anxiety but compared to months ago when I was waking up crying everyday it's a hell of a lot better and they normally pass. ..General: I've started running again which is ace. Also I went to physio because I've been having shoulder problems and one of my exercises is just to lie on the floor on a towel...Easiest physio exercise ever. 
Congrats on getting your beautiful new shoes and thank you for creating the post!..**Struggle:** This is just day 3 for me. I'm a weekend binge-drinker (sometimes I'd binge on weekdays if there was an event or excuse such a birthday or a big game).  I'm a little scared that I won't be strong enough to avoid drinking this weekend but I'm determined to do my best not to...**Triumph:** I told my parents and 2 of my closest friends that I have an alcohol problem and I'm quitting. They all knew but telling them openly felt like a significant step. It's something I haven't done other things I have tried to quit. My father happens to be very ill and I helped my uncle fix up some things that needed fixing at my parents' as my father was observing us. I've never been much of a handyman myself so that felt like an accomplishment as well. Today I'm helping my mother to take my father to hospital which is going to be a struggle. He should go with an ambulance but refuses to because he's a very stubborn man a quality that I definitely inherited from him (being stubborn has its good things too; my father and I are both very perseverant)...**General:** Hang in there! Thanks for your support and hope you have the best day you possibly can. ..&amp;#x200B;
Struggle: My conniving husband is contesting which state he is based in so I'm going to have to go through another set of lawyers. It's going to men more legal fees time and effort. Aargh!..Truimph: my health scare turned out ok and the doctor actually the time to talk through my case in depth with me. I'm proud of myself or reaching out to people about this issue and following up with doctors appointments...General: I joined Tinder and it is such a good laugh for an older person. Is this really what the kids are doing now? ..IWDWYT and congratulations on the shoes Mary!
**Struggle:** I m getting really winded up over some deadlines that approach like black holes. At least they keep me from mulling over some bad news I got when I went to the doctor but every time I slow down it s there; two new diagnosis...es? that will not get better only worse. Oh well. It s just life and we all know how that s going to end - *in a blaze of glory!*..**Triumph:** My wife and I have sent our first design to our first customer in our baby fresh business and they love it!! Weeee!!!..**General:** Oh I d love to be part of that freak show!! Pick me pick me pick me!!..**General 2:** We ll reach 150 000 one of these days. Amazing.
Morning SD IWNDWYT
**Triumph** All the recent challenges have triggered my latent PTSD - but I am NOT using booze pot or anything else to try and stuff it down. Instead I am giving myself plenty of time to rest I am being honest in a very calm and matter-of-fact way about how I feel with people when I need to and I am not pushing myself outside my emotional comfort zone right now on any level. All of which is making it much more manageable to the point I am more or less functioning quite well in terms of taking care of what absolutely must be done from day to day. This is HUGE for me. In the past I've always pushed myself to the point where I fall apart quite radically OR self-medicated in harmful ways...**struggle** I might be *coping* with the resurgent PTSD but it is taking constant work and I am having to be aware of the "cop-out" reflex that seeks the off switch of the wine bottle as a default position...**general** found two cool full-time jobs in my field at the campus of the Uni I start study at this year to apply for one in marketing content writing one in social media. I know from friends who work there already they are super-good about flexible working including work from home days and juggling things around kids. This could be exactly the opportunity I need to really restructure my life in a good way..
Struggle: I keep thinking about how I'm going to handle situations where I would normally be drinking. Since I quit I haven't really done anything that would have previously involved drinking. However I do have a wedding two concerts and the whole summer ahead of me. I'm just going to keep taking it one day at a time though!..Triumph: I have so much more time and I'm also using the money I would have spent on drinking to pay down debt. My apartment is clean I'm cooking instead of constantly getting pizza or fast food and I'm reading a lot more. ..General: Just finished Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari and it was a great read. It makes you think and changed my perspective on a lot of things. ..IWNDWYT!
Glad to hear about your shoes Mary. I have awful feet and always have. I have huge bunions and taylor's bunions on both feet and that has made most cute shoes out of the question for me all of my life. I bitch about winter here in MN but secretly love that it's an excuse to wear huge forgiving snow boots every day for several months. Even most flipflops some how or other rub my feet wrong so summer is hard on me footwear-wise. ..**Triumph** I appear to be surviving yet another rough week at work. ..**Struggle** Work. Why couldn't I have been born to an independently wealthy family?..**General** This time last year I reconnected with my childhood best friend. It's disappointing to learn that we really have nothing to say to each other. "Work sucks". We've got that in common and very little else. 
**Struggle**: A very important very time crunched very complicated work project got dumped on me a couple days ago. I've been cranking on it as well as my other operational responsibilities...**Triumph**: I'm tired not putting much energy into things like cooking but I'm **DEALING** with family responsibilities and making things happen. I'm not depressed not exploding and even having fun (in the loopy exhausted oh-shit-why-am-I-laughing-uncontrollably way). The time and energy going into work is being recognized by colleagues. The final project has benefited from my attention. [Satisfied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHn_Kb4Dz40)! 
Struggle:  I am smoking again!  Wtf. ...Triumph:  I'm working on quitting smoking. Down to less than a pack per day.
Thanks for the thought-provoking post Mary.  And hooray for your cute shoes!..&amp;#x200B;
**Struggle** Toxic ass friend alert! Trying to have healthy boundaries without panic or feeling like I'm being bad or judged. Made this mistake of agreeing to see them this weekend though I am seriously considering bailing. This feels like a linchpin moment in my life here is a chance to really express my self state what I need clearly and disengage as needed. There's only drama so long as I play along right...?..**triumph**  haven't had a drink in a week! Also feels like I am genuinely forming a connection with my inner world. It's like who is this person?! But in the best way :)..**general** 3 day weekend coming up!
Been just over a month for me. Lost 15 pounds approx and been killing it at work. Every day I want a drink more and more lately but the cravings pass and I know it will get better...This sub definitely helps.

Triumph - I am on vacation with my husband in Zion national park and have not had one urge to drink. Today is day 107...Struggle - with my expectations of vacation. We're here in January why was I thinking clear blue sky and sunny cloudless days for hiking? It's snowy and rainy and many of the trails are closed. As well as the govt shutdown putting a real damper on things visitors centers closed disgusting bathrooms. Sad to see our beautiful national parks treated like this. While it hasn't been the ideal trip it's been A good lesson in being thankful for what you have. I'm on vacation!..General - I am honestly really looking forward to being back home in my snowy cozy corner of the northeast with my cats! 
Triumph:  I'm currently sitting at my new job head of security for a 20 story skyscraper...Struggle:  I forgot about how weird a new job makes me feel.  I've been having what can only be described as a mini panic attack every morning this week.  As soon as I get to work though I'm fine.  ..General:  I thought drinking was behind some of my worst habits turns out I'm just a shitty person. 
**T:**  Made some genuine progress on my daughter's room.  ..**S:**  Her bday is coming up so we're coming up on another round of an influx of cheap plastic goods...**G:**  I think I'm a little too hard on myself...  Well maybe more than a little.  I've been a single parent for almost 2.5 years student working full time bee keeper sick old dog psycho puppy completely out of control it's just like yeah it's impossible to thrive in all dimensions of life I mean when we see a successful person they still have problems.  Look at Bezos what good is all that money if it still can't make a marriage work.  
I love this thread! I'm still pretty new to Reddit and this group so this is my first time experiencing  what's up Wednesday  lol - SD is becoming my new addiction ;) ..Triumph:  I've felt the most accomplished over the past week than I have in almost an entire year. Not that I've done anything huge and spectacular per se but my depression is continuing to lift and I am seizing the opportunity to  become great  again! I am optimistic motivated and inspired to begin new healthy and fulfilling habits. ..Struggles:  we are at our lowest financial point that we've been in in over 10 years. Our household income has reduced by half and we are dangerously close to bankruptcy. My husband and I met with a trustee and filed a consumer proposal this week.  Adjustments to our spending habits and lifestyle have hit hard and fast. ..General: The only things in life that I have 100% control over are attitude and effort. Everything else is out of my hands. .
Yay for cute footwear!  I go through periods of not caring what I wear or look like and then suddenly become quite self-conscious that I am dressed like an eccentric old lady and rush to remedy the situation.  :-)..**Struggle:**  Pushing myself out of my comfort zone and actually moving in the direction of getting a new job.  I am really struggling with believing that I am qualified for a better job as much of my skills are soft skills and the hard skills I have are from a different career and are 8 years old.  Working with a professional resume writer to gain some confidence and some new words to describe my proficiencies...**Triumph:** See above.  I'm actually taking a step!  I've been hemming and hawing on making a move for probably 5 freaking years!!  Safety and complacency have been a really hard web to extricate myself from...**General:**  Sooo grateful for best friends and meditation apps!!
Struggle: all this energy from not drinking is overshadowed by the flu. Uggg. I'm on day 4 and it won't go away. ..It's one of those illnesses that I feel like garbage but can moderately function. That almost makes it worse because I CAN work (I work from home) but I feel like a dumpster fire. ..My daughter had it I took her to the doc and they gave her antivirals. They were $100 a pop! I can't afford getting them for myself so I just have to grin and bear it. ..I'm missing my therapy appointment today die to sickness and bad weather/roads and I'm super bummed about that. ..Blarg. ..Truimph: not drinking for 15 days! And been doing daily yoga challenge for 15 days too not missing a day even with the flu. I dont have many cravings for alcohol either it's getting easier and easier seeing myself as a non-drinker. ..General: getting lots of weather where I am at. Snowed about a foot last night. Now it's raining which sucks. But supposed to get another foot tomorrow. I'm in California so weather like this is very important- drought and wildfires always loom heavy in the background here. 
Struggle: it's Wednesday and my husband just left for 2 days. I'm home alone with my 3 year old and it's snowing. That familiar feeling that I'm just not up for this any of it has crept in. That feeling that everything is exhausting and one day we'll all be gone and forgotten anyway so what's the point of any of this? It's probably related to hormones as I don't feel this way all the time but it feels so real and endless right now. I'm constantly trying to recall what it's like to feel great and remind myself I'll be there again. ..Triumph: I'm the new year Marie Kondo cliche going through all my stuff and getting rid of a ton. It does feel good to let go of things I've been holding onto for no reason. I also haven't spent any money; working hard on getting rid of stuff is a good motivator to not buy more... also we have some debt to pay down so that's a good goal. And I haven't drank in 45 days. I still remember that it won't help me...I hope everyone else is hanging in there!
**struggle:** i have been so annoyed with my boss this week. she never shuts up and by the end of the day i feel so tense and overstimulated just from trying not to show how irritated i am. it's exhausting and i feel like i have no energy or motivation to be productive by the time i finally make it home...**triumph:** despite the constant irritation i have chosen not to drink after work! i may not be productive but if i'm going to sit on the couch and shove food in my face at least i'm not doing it with an entire bottle of wine...**general:** this weekend i'm going to buckle down and finish at least one of my applications for grad school. deadlines are coming up and i know i'll feel better once it's done! having an exit plan for this shitty job is one of the few things that's helping me keep it together...&amp;#x200B;
**Struggle:** Right there with you [u/sfgirlmary](https://www.reddit.com/user/sfgirlmary) For the past two weeks I have been haunted by regret (kicking myself) wishing I had stopped drinking sooner. I can count on my fingers the days I haven't had a drink in the past 15 years but the regret of what I could have done in those years sober is infinite. I have learned more in the past two weeks that I feel I have in the past two years (or more) and I am tormented by the question "Why didn't I do this sooner?" ..**Triumph:** Last weekend I spent about an hour journaling out an "Alcohol Timeline" detailing some of my earliest experiences to the more recent ones that triggered/furthered my dependence. It's amazing when you get something on the page and you see it in a different light. I had some pretty stressful/traumatic experiences was ill-equipped to deal with them and turned to booze because I saw everyone else do it.  .I thought to myself as I wrote out my timeline "Shit no wonder you downed the booze!" I forgave myself because at the time of the incidences I had no guidance no tools no support to know it was the wrong choice. Forgiveness of myself. That was   and continues to be   huge. ..**General:**  It's no use going back to yesterday because I was a different person then.    Lewis Carroll.. Give a girl the correct footwear and she can conquer the world.    Bette Midler

New here and digging that there's some structure to this threat so I can go on autopilot and just follow the outline ;) ..&amp;#x200B;..Struggle: Pretty maddening PTSD from a recent divorce from a person with borderline personality disorder (yowza) and the recovery from that plus cutting out the booze is leaving me fairly flat and feeling like a shell. My social life has gone out the window but I just am paying attention to healing and cutting out things that stress me out even if it doesn't make sense logically (spending time with loving friends)..&amp;#x200B;..Triumph: Getting along okay at newish very high pressure job. Not blowing anyone's socks off but I'm getting quite a bit done and making solid improvements for the company. Supportive friendly coworkers are helping. ..&amp;#x200B;..Getting into yoga pretty heavily too. I'm doing about an hour and day and just making it a part of the daily routine no questioning it or falling back on it. Cutting back on my cardio addiction and trying to retrain my brain that yoga is enough right now. ..&amp;#x200B;..General: Happy to realize some folks that I haven't spoken to in awhile are very supportive about my sobriety efforts (day 78 here). Meanwhile my old friends are partying hard and I'm saddened that they may just have been drinking buddies all this time enabling each other. Sigh.
So could do with a little help gave up drinking around six months ago but recently started again been drinking at work all day recently could do with some tiles on trying to stop 
**Struggle:** Started substitute teaching recently and can no longer go to my home group nearly as much as I used to. I was really enjoying this group that I had only just recently made my home group so I feel a little lost in regards to finding a group I feel really comfortable in. This just means I see my sponsor less at meetings. I have trouble saying how I really feel to people in fear of hurting their feelings making them made. This can turn me into kind of a pushover...**Triumph:** Applied for an apartment and am going to be living for the first time on my own (with a roommate). Excited to finally be paying my own bills and really doing the adult thing. I'm so happy to be doing it sober...**General:** I just remembered as a joke in high school I put "don't trust the fart" as my senior quote and it ended up actually being my senior quote in the year book.
Struggle: It's wintertime and cloudy. I like snow but not the cold. When it's cloudy I am in a different mood. ..Triumph: My gym time is more rewarding now. I didn't realize how tired I used to be. ..General: The term "smart shoes" has a new meaning these days. I read there's a self-lacing sneaker coming out that's app-controlled.
Had a long day yesterday rested today. I had a super vivid dream last night that was cool- haven't dreamed in a long time. ..Not drinking today. 
I wanna drink so badly this hangover sucksssssssssssssssssssss
- Struggle: it's not a struggle necessarily but this week I've planned and worked on taking care of my apartment. Some broken things needing replacement. While I drank I had little interest to take care of anything. Empty cans and bottles on the tables next to piles of books I had planned to buy a bookshelf for. I had a broken lamp in the ceiling and used whatever minimal light my lazy drunken ass could arrange with no real effort. I basically spent the fall alone in my neglected apartment in darkness. Sad to think of it...- Triumph: I bought and installed a new lamp today it boosts my spirit a lot to have some light. I have been looking at bookshelves online will get one during weekend. I already bought some tools to drill it to the wall...- General: I've had more interest to plan and take care of work finances apartment and my health. Still work to do with all of those to teach myself out of some lazy habits I've adjusted to during my drinking. One day at a time. I love how everyday I find something I can make better and see that I have the time energy and money to do it...IWNDWYT
Struggle: I've been really down this week. ..Triumph: I took time off work to work through my stuff this week. That has been helpful. ..General: This too shall pass. :) 
I get the regret thing I'm the same. Hoping that soon I'll move on from it otherwise in ten years I'll regret wasting the next ten. Good news about the shoes! :) 
I know I already posted but I just wanted to say that I saw a copy of Frankenstein at the book store and I thought of you.  I'm not sure if that's good or bad but I figured I'd let you know.  :)
Triumph: no drinking for four days now and though I've had cravings they have been manageable. Hot cocoa plus popcorn in the evening helps...Struggle: tried to reconnect with a person I care about from my past who reconnects in a limited way but more limited than I'd ideally like. No response. So I felt awful for putting my heart on the line like that when I should know better...Grieved that some and then realized I don't want the friendship as much as I first thought. And then cried about that a while. I guess the second triumph in that is that I like my life even with sadness about past unchangeable mistakes...General: seeing some ladies friends this weekend and reasonably sure I can get through just one night of watching them all drink wine while I have club soda. Looking forward to a possible east coast storm. ..
Triumph:..Made it through my holiday without drinking. There were lots of times a cold beer called to me. Felt a bit stressed lately but haven't drunk. Paid off my credit card debt. ..Struggle: ..My partner is smoking too much weed and it's affecting me as they stay up late and wake me up. I'm sick of it. I have expressed my feelings let's see what happens. ..General: ..I am doing ok sometimes I feel a bit robotic in social situations like I can't relax but I still have a good time. 
Triumph I guess- I'm about to walk into my first ever AA meeting. Sitting in the Peking lot. ..Struggle - I'm nervous. Hoping it'll be a good experience. Trying to keep an open mind but I get all anxious before any event/gathering..General - I'm currently in a support group and individual addiction counseling. They all suggested I try it out. I was hesitant at first but we'll see how it goes
I need some help honestly I cannot stop drinking. Would someone reach out to ms.? .
Struggle: Having difficulties sleeping. Really has been messing with my health and wellness.  .Triumph: Went a solid 16 days without a drink. Typically I am a social binge drinker last weekend attended a dinner with many friends and just drank water and Coke! And even tonight in catching up with a friend was able to limit myself to just one hard cider! One usually turns into two which turns into at least four pretty often.  .General: So just found this sub have been contemplating quite a while cutting down on alcohol for a while now. So this is cool to have found and look forward to being able to share here for some extra support. I often struggle with the "just having one drink" sometimes so not only am I hoping to find new activities to do on weekends that don't involve drinking if I do decide to order alcohol on rare occasions I'd like to just learn to control my cravings and stop after ONE.
