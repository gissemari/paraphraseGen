I was hesitant to even send the request for flair as the beginning always leaves me wondering if this decision to stop is a knee-jerk reaction to doing something stupid and a week or two later I'm back at Costco buying mass amounts of high ABV beer. ..First the term alcoholic. I struggle with that term because for all intents and purposes I am one. I need to address that but the other half of the problem is that by acknowledging it a relapse feels like a failure. If I convince myself it was just slightly out of control or "I love beer that's all! I'm just a craft beer fan!" it gives me a bit of an excuse to keep going...That voice in my head of "I'll get to a point of moderation down the line I'll drink again but I'll have a handle on it!" is slowly happening less and less. I know it'll never go away but I gain a little bit of "life XP" every time I disregard it. Eventually I'll hit the level cap :) ..It's been a week now just one week and life is already better. My wife is totally on board I'm sleeping better I've spent more time with my newborn son and 2 year old daughter. I've gotten more done around the house and am getting into work early (thanks newborn! they are the best alarm clocks) without feeling like shit. ..However every day is a challenge and probably will remain as such. The good thing is every day is also a victory. Every day I succeed I've won something: A better happier healthier life. ..

Welcome /u/ohsoverywrong to /r/stopdrinking -- at this [link is the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which you may or may not have come across before.  It's what I did to stop drinking and stay stopped.  Personally I don't think it matters all that much at first what you call yourself and certainly not nearly as important as stopping and getting sustained time sober.  It is with sustained time sober that I gained clarity sufficient to gain purpose and momentum...Good luck to you.
Hello and welcome. Congratulations on your two young children. I had an alcoholic father and it affected me well into adulthood. Your babies need a sober dad. ..One day at a time worked for me!
I hate the term alcoholic too. Always in my mind the logic went like this. "Alcoholic = disease = crutch = excuse = weakness = victim mentality = weak willpower" and I am generally not a weak willed person. But when I started fantasizing about alcohol it literally being the first thing I wanted in the morning and such I started to grow worried...On small thing that clicked for me is while I have always been ABLE to put the bottle down to prove to people SO etc I am not addicted I HATE doing it. I can stop at one beer but then I spend the next 6 hours wanting another one worse than anything...That's where your "I'm just a craft beer fan!" mentality gets someone like me in a lot of trouble....
I applaud you.  You sound so much like me.  I convince myself I'm just a huge wine lover.  Love going to tastings (and getting drunk) love having a glass of wine (that's in the bottom of the bottle).
