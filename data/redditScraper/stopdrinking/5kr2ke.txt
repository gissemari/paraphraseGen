Hello everyone. I've been reading this reddit for awhile and struggling to stay sober for any meaningful amount of time. I had 8 days going into Christmas and relapsed that night. Drank an excessive amount (as always) and had to work the next day. Working full of regret and anxiety and wondering if I stunk...I had a few years under my belt until 2011. Things started going well and I figured "drinking on the weekends can't hurt right!" Huge mistake. I never was a daily drinker just a big time binger. And over the last 5 years the binges have gotten worse. The withdrawal has gotten worse. And yet after 5 days or so I drink again...I've hidden it from most everyone in my life. The people I care the most about still think I've only had one relapse since 2011. I'm ashamed of myself and want to be done with this for good. Joining you fine folks here is a way of drawing a line in the sand. I need support in some form. Just looking to put together 24 hours at a time. Thanks for reading and I won't drink with you all today.

Hi we're glad you're here.  I drank the exact same as you not every day but all of it when I did.  And when I did got more frequent and worse.  This has been way better.  I won't drink with you today!
Welcome! I'm not drinking with you today. One day at a time. ..I know exactly what you mean with thinking "I'm doing so well one drink on the weekends won't hurt." I've played that game with myself soo many times. For me it always leads back into daily drinking. So I finally told myself to just stay away from the stuff altogether! 
Welcome! Checking in here daily and reading *This Naked Mind* made all the difference in the world for me...There's a link for a free copy over in the sidebar.....
