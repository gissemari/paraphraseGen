Hang in there! First two days were the worst for me.
Damn this is the best description of the first few days I think I've ever read. Sorry you're struggling but hang in there. As u/cyclefreaksix said the first couple days are the hardest...And damn do I love this:.&gt; The alcohol is dying in my system and its not going down without a struggle. I hope its suffering..I hope so too.
You've got this! Your SD friends are cheering you on and would be delighted if alcohol went down suffering!
Crawl into bed and sleep a lot if you can.
