Worst day to be emotional about sobriety huh? I don't know if this is normal but the last few days everything has been getting to me and today I'm feeling it. Seeing all my friends post about day drinking and their plans tonight to go bar hopping has me feeling really left out even though I know I can go out and have a soda water instead. Went to my regular AA meeting but just couldn't bring myself to be as into it as I usually am. Unfortunately I live a block from where everyone will be drinking tonight but thankfully I work late and I'm planning on just going to the gym after work. At least I can guarantee that place'll be empty tonight haha. ..Not in the best headspace but I will not break my sobriety and IWNDWYT.

Sounds like a fine plan to get through this evening.  Patience it's not always going to be so difficult if we keep at it our brain chemistry even out and we start feeling much better about everything.  Go earn yourself a nice NDV tonight and good job!  IWNDWYT
Hang in there. I've learned to "play the tape forward" and think about how I'll feel the next morning next week next year. It really does help me in the tough moments. Be kind to yourself! Know that a lot of folks are not drinking with you tonight.
Maybe I'm weak. I shut down all social media besides this app. Everything feels like a trigger and I'm tired of alcohol driving my life.  Sobriety over everything. #IWNDWYT
I'm praying for you. Once you break through the struggle the reward is great.  Stay strong.
