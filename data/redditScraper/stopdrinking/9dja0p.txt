I'm on my third day of attempting a long stent of sobriety. Last night I was in class and we're going over some material that I'm already struggling with and it's making me incredibly anxious. .Usually after class I reward my self and take the edge off with several drinks. But I went straight home to sit and fidget in front of my wife. Then lay in bed not sleeping   It's just really hard right now. I'm covered in cold sweat sick to my stomach and panicking. I'm barely functioning at work.

I'm sorry you're feeling unwell. Just think about how much easier it will be to absorb the content of your studies once you're rid of the foggy brain of alcohol. And how much better your problem solving and coping will be once you kick the early days of alcohol withdrawal anxiety! ..The stage you're in is hard. The hardest part. You can do it dig in push through and remember it's the only time you'll ever have to do it!
This is not an easy thing you're doing and the first few days are really hard. I guarantee it will pass if you stay sober.
