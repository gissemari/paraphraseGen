Hi stopdrinking ..Longtime lurker and wanted to post about myself. I've been attempting unsuccessfully to quit alcohol for about 2 years now. I'm about to turn 28 and want to stop but for the life of me cannot make it past 5-7 days without caving and drinking. ..My drinking has morphed me into someone who isolates and is self destructive. I have some sober friends through AA but I can't tell them that I relapse so often for fear of being ostracized hence me coming to this forum and seeking some support through the internet. ..I can say with certainty that I want to stop. Drinking no longer brings me pleasure (only a 30 minute high and then its 24+ hours of hangover symptoms). I know if I can make it past the early days the alcohol cravings will become less and less I just cant seem to get past that first 5-7 days. ..&amp;#x200B;..Anyway any thoughts or ideas would be helpful. Feel free to send me a message if you'd like.
