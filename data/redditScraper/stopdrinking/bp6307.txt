I need some thoughts from you guys regarding drinking. For context I am in my mid 20s working a full time job...I need help seeing a life without alcohol as I am conflicted about its role in my life and how I should feel about it. I feel like everything fun in life revolves around alcohol. Happy hour concerts friday nights sports games movies festivals vacations dinners etc. It's like alcohol has creeped into every event. ..I know that I could do most of these things as a teetotaler but I get a sense that I am missing out without alcohol. I have tried to cut down. It is always like "oh I will just have two beers no harm" but it almost always turns into 6+. This keeps me in a cycle of regret where I know I want to change but feel like I have no where to go after that change. I hate the idea that I could be harming my physical and mental health but a life without alcohol feels like I would be sitting in bored solitude. Does anyone else struggle with this?

Everyday
I did. Until I met someone. You can always go to these things without buying alcohol. It may take time and people may not agree with you. You always here the same excuses. You won't have fun if you don't drink. It's just a few. You'll miss out. I would always bring water to people's houses or pop that I liked and made sure I stuck with that. I dealt with a massive addiction problem with alcohol and pills. Once I realized how much I destroyed my body I started investing in hobbies that I loved doing. Working out building computers and just being outdoors. Once I finally got into a routine of things it helped me quit all together. I know not everyone can do this but it helps when you have friends that support you in no matter what you do. I wake up on weekends at 6. I have a job I work 530 to 230. I have more energy and feel like myself.
