I'm going to bed sober tonight. It wasn't an easy day but I asked a friend to hang out with me for a few hours then my wife told me we'll watch the 5 remaining episodes of dating around we had left so now I am happily sitting on the couch a satisfied sober chap...today was a tough day. BUT there are some days which are easy. I love love love those days. The longer I stay sober the more of those days I have - it's a real motivator to keep up sobriety...The times I've relapsed I've felt trapped as hell the day I relapsed and then usually for a day or two at least afterwards. I feel super anxious I feel sick and bloated I feel like maybe my liver is acting up or something and I feel disgusted with myself...but the days when I wake up feeling super chill and I go to bed feeling super chill? Those are the best days...It's 11:32pm here in NYC. Going to bed soon. I hope tomorrow is an easy day for you all and I hope it's an easy day for me.

Feeling free is so wonderful! IWNDWYT 
Easy day or not we have a gift. We don't have to drink today and that's a beautiful thing...

I'm here in LA getting ready for the day. I was starting to feel anxious about my work day so I jumped on the sub and found your post. Thank you. I needed to read what you posted. I know I have a busy day ahead and was feeling a bit nervous. I decided after reading I'm just going to take it slow. I'll do my best but not over think. I'll keep calm and considerate. I'll keep it simple. My goal is to make today mine and to not feel trapped by any given circumstance. So.. yea .. today I'm going to live free. I'm going to live life on my own terms while owning up to my responsibilities. ..Wow   Thank You!  - that was awesome !
