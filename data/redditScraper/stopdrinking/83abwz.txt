So I'm absolutely terrified of flying. Like shaking right now on the verge of tears because I have to fly in a few hours scared...In a fit of missing my family I booked a last minute trip to surprise my brother on his birthday.  In the past I have dealt with my severe flight anxiety by a combination of booze ativan and my travel buddies making sure I navigated the airport correctly...I'll be flying solo and I'm going to navigate this sober as I'll be by myself.  Does anyone have any tips or tricks for a fraidy-cat flier?
