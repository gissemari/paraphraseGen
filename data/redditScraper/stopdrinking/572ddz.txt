[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy hump day! What's up Wednesdays are when we calibrate our sobriety check in see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..**Triumph:** My brother calls me Junior. Recently he had supper at my house and snapped a picture of me then sent it to his wife who has not seen me since before I quit drinking. She is not the type to give compliments but she texted him back  Junior looks AMAZING!  This really gave me a boost...**Struggle:** Recently I was looking through my desk and found a postcard advertising a David Hockney exhibit that was at the Palace of Fine Arts here in San Francisco in 2013. I remembered that a coworker had asked if I wanted to go with him but I had said no (because it wasn't a place where I could drink). So I missed an exhibition by one of my favorite artists for booze! I still struggle with sadness when I think of ways in which I have allowed drinking to limit my life...**General:** I was doing some research on the White House and I found out that Richard Nixon loved bowling so much he added a bowling alley to the basement of the White House when he was president..
----------immediate responses--------

**Triumph:** I have become an active anonymous alcoholic IRL..**Struggle:** I don't have any appetite any longer after beginning multiple daily AA meetings. It is almost 10pm here and my last meal was a small microwaved potato with like 1/4 cup sour cream at about 630 a.m. Yesterday I didn't eat at all until 10p.m. Before AA I had just weened off of the ice cream phase...**General:** There are some attractive women in AA. This is one of the last places I would think of for obvious reasons but the attention is... reassuring. I never wanted a relationship during my years as a soldier and especially not as a drunk. I left a relationship with the last serious girlfriend I've had in 2008 when she cheated on me. If there's one thing that keeps booze out of my hands it's the thought of finding someone again and as an adult (who knows he's an alcoholic).
**Triumph:** 55 days... seriously 55 days! *happy dance*..**Struggle:** My mum just rang - my step-dad collapsed and has been taken to hospital. He is just shy of his 80th birthday and unfortunately it looks like he has had a(nother) major stroke. I hurt for my mum my step-dad (obviously!) and for myself. On the up-side (if there can be one) my first reaction was not to find a bottle but to come here and share - so thanks /u/sfgirlmary this was a well timed post for me. Mum only rang a couple of minutes ago so I really don't know too much but I have everything crossed for the best possible outcome...**General:** My husband and I are doing this 'not drinking' thing together. We are for obvious reasons each on our own journey and responsible only for ourselves but it has been wonderful to have the support. He's been my best friend for a lifetime so it matters. Anyway...he's in the military and has been lucky with a lengthy (for him) spell at home but he left on Sunday and won't be back for a few months - which sucks :( Although I shouldn't complain too much at least this time we can talk to him pretty regularly unlike some of his 'trips away'.

**Triumph:** Things are good for me right now. I've just generally been in a better mood since my trip and I'm feeling more relaxed. Excited for fall and the changing of the seasons. ..**Struggle:** I want to say the bags of kit kats I bought are for halloween. But they're not. They'll be long gone by then. I gotta learn to use my better judgement when picking snacking options. ..**General:** I want to say a giant **thank you** to /u/sfgirlmary for taking over the What's Up Wednesday for us!! I've had an awesome turn with hosting the last couple of months and it's time for some new blood to continue this SD tradition. 
**Triumph** : Got up at 7am this morning and went for a run in the cold British Autumn woods. It was wonderful. ...**Struggle** : Just realizing how much work I have to do to get my new website up and running before the weekend. ...**General** : I'm so much more present with my daughter when my blood is clean of alcohol in the mornings. I used to be snappy grumpy tired and impatient. I already find myself enjoying every second of being with her. It's amazing how drinking chips away so slowly at your ability to see what you're doing to your family over time. So glad to be back on track. 
Hey u/sfgirlmary thank you kindly for picking up What's Up Wednesday! And many sincere thanks to u/stratyturd for hosting the past several months. Much appreciation and hugs go out to Mary and Straty...woohoo!! Thanks to our wonderful mod's we are safe comfortable and sober when we come to SD every day. ..I don't have much today but I do have one that I'll use to dovetail on Mary's General: a (non-drinking) friend of mine just told me about St. John the Divine cathedral here in NYC. It's ironic because I've always loved architecture specifically gothic cathedrals and the old mansions. I just haven't spent much time doing the research lately. Anyway I come to find many magnificent facts about it (e.g. Raphael's tapestries and other treasured pieces are housed there and I'm also a big fine arts fan). From that conversation and my follow-up research I've rediscovered something about myself that I truly loved PRIOR to drinking. Yay!! Perhaps I'll get back into my museum obsessions and art book collection. It's good to know I may have recaptured a hobby and that I can enjoy it so much more now :). 
Triumph: After months of looking for a house in our price range (and getting outbid etc. as there's a dearth of affordable options in our area) my husband and I have secured a little brick ranch house. Yay! We move in at the end of November...Struggle: Trying not to panic at huge financial commitment of house and let the stress affect my marriage...General: A couple of weeks ago I mentioned in What's Up Wednesday that I bought a refurbished spin bike. Best move! I love getting up and doing my own workout on my own terms!..Thanks so much sfgirlmary for taking over this thread and to strayturd for keeping us going for so long. You guys rock!
Hello people. ..**Triumph**: I had 2 addictions the other was weed. I smoked a metric tonne of the shit for 15 years. Figured it might be easier to do one thing at a time and quit drinking first but finally stopped smoking and it's been almost 2 weeks of total sobriety. Finally where I dreamed of being for so long. Yay. ..**Struggle**: This damn pink cloud thing I posted about last night. I shouldn't have read into it. Today was the first low day since I quit drinking. Think I popped my bubble. Also might have sleep apnoea or something that added to it apparently I snored so loud last night the wife needed earplugs and I was so tired all day even after a full nights sleep. Not sure why it's worse now after stopping everything. ..**General**: I am always hungry at the minute. If this is any indication of how my life is going to be from now on i'm going to live a tasty tasty existence. ..
Lmao imagine who Nixon invited to the White House to bowl with him
**Triumph**: 5 weeks sobriety. Started running again more frequently. ..**Struggle**: Been feeling pretty blah recently. Moved back to my hometown stuck with my parents for another three weeks til I move. Feeling anxious about the future. ..I will also admit I am missing going out on the town. I don't miss being drunk or the aftermath but I do miss drinking and going out with friends. That sort of sucks. I will get over it but I am feeling moany...**General**: I am reading a book called the Outrun about someone who leaves London and move back home due to becoming an alcoholic. That story is eerily similar to mine. 
Triumph : Crossed the 1 month mark. Meeting with the therapist every other week now insteas of every week. Feeling stronger each day...Struggle : Last friday had a trigger and almost said forget it.... while standing in the automotive isle I look down and there is a bottle of Makers Mark... my old favorite... what a sign. An out of place bottle of whiskey. Anyway decided my feelings would pass and moved on. ..General : I'm getting better sleep. Full productive days are great... sad to think how many days I wasted sleeping through them because of an "all nighter" yuck... hated that feeling. Self respect and confidence coming back. One day at a time because thats all we got! .
Triumph: I'm still here fighting the good fight.Struggle: after my first initial 90 days of sobriety- I tried moderating for for several months with no successs. I'm back again..General: This time my SO is not drinking either  .
**Triumph:** I was struggling to think of a triumph not that things are bad just normal. But I have a picture victory to share also. Due to some miscommunication with my mom I thought we were all meeting up at my brother's the other night and then going to dinner. When I got there nobody was home. So I let myself in took a selfie with his dog and sent it to my bro. He replied with "Cool pic!" high praise from an older brother. It was a nice picture; that thing in the eyes that you can see in peoples before and after pics I could see it in my eyes! It felt really good to see that in myself...**Struggle:** I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow. I had every intention of coming clean with my doc about my drinking history when I made the appointment. Now that it's almost here I'm having second thoughts. I don't like the idea of admitting to the fact that I had lied to her for years about how much I was drinking. I don't like the idea of having a comment added to my chart of "alcohol use disorder". I'm afraid that my genuine complaints of pain are going to be seen as drug seeking behavior now. Ugg. I know I'm going to do the right thing and be honest but I don't like it...**General:** Thanks u/sfgirlmary for taking on the what's up Wednesday! Here's a bit of interesting White House history: Theodore Roosevelt was known to have a lot of pets kept at the White House. My favorite is his son Archie who was 9 at the time had a pet badger named Josiah.
**Triumph:** I'm in the middle of a small renovation project. There is something very satisfying about sawzalls and sledgehammers...**Struggle:** I'm solo dadding this week. My littlest has a horrible cold and been home. I'm trying to nurse him keep critical work projects going and keep the house from imploding. Yeah I'm a bit pinned...**General:** There has not been an art exhibit in town that I'm super excited about since getting sober. It will be interesting to see art with much better awareness of my emotions.
STRUGGLE:  .3:30am checking overnight work emails on my cell in bed before I pop up like a friggin clown-in-a-box and hit the desk for another day hustling Hollyhell.  I offered a client a deal a steal a sale of the fucking century on bailing them out hardcore $200 cash for 8 hours of my work and gear.  But they "need to think" about this one.  REALLY???  I dropped $1600 the other week to get my fucking car through this year's smog check.  I didn't question it I took out my second-to-last platinum card that I haven't maxed out yet and slapped it down next to the mechanic's register.  It's what it costs it's what I fucking dish out for something that I NEED.  My oil changes cost $80 for 20 minutes in L.A. yet these morons are debating $200 for one day of my skilled digital work on my own gear to bail out their precious "film."..GENERAL:  .Did you know that squirrels in Poland are red and have just about the most heelarious "pants" like ever?  Check this li'l dude out TOO FUNNY!  He's my phone's wallpaper today so that I don't get myself arrested with my possible reactions to the morons mentioned above:.https://1drv.ms/i/s!AvfaCaklFbSIgWad5NtyO-GHEbTZ..(best for last).TRIUMPH:  .I'm really not all that tempted to drink anymore.  I have my moments usually at 3 or 4pm when I'm tired and haven't had dinner yet but that's just years of psychological and physical habit that too are wearing off nowadays.  I think after my last relapse a while ago the lightbulb finally went PPHHHFFFT in my remaining brain cell and I finally get it.  It's actually not so hard not to do something I don't want to do anymore anyways...Clown =  1..Universe = 0..
2 days. Feel much better. Not drinking today!
Cool thread. This is my first post here. I'm on day 206 of not drinking and just came upon this forum looking for another source of support...Triumph: Ran a half marathon this weekend 7 minutes faster than I've ever done before and 35 pounds lighter than I was the day I quit.  The physical transformation into a healthy sober person has really been amazing for me. It's the main thing that keeps me going each day to be honest...Struggle: My marriage has become a real struggle since I became sober and I'm not sure why. My wife seems to have trouble supporting me and I have trouble understanding why and whether it has to do with resentments left over from when I was drinking. We're in counseling together (and separately) so we're working on it but it's just exhausting to be fighting for a marriage and sobriety every day.  Looking forward to some smooth happy days in the future because right now it just feels like there are too many hours in the day...General: Just really excited to have found this forum. My psychiatrist keeps telling me to go to AA but I haven't worked up the courage yet. This forum feels like a little step towards finding a real life support network.
**Triumph:** I've lost about 15 pounds (probably closer to 20 but 15 since I started paying attention) in the last three months. Obviously not consuming all the calories from drinking and eating like shit because I'm drunk are the biggest factor. I started lifting weights about 5 weeks ago as well and while it's too early to see any real results from that I feel better than I have in years...**Struggle:** It's "Craft Beer Week" in my town an annual event that culminates with a pretty cool festival and an afterparty for all of the brewers at my restaurant. We are doing different promotions every night and there's a lot of hand shaking and shmoozing required of me which is not something I am good at. Add to that being around the constant drinking and finding ways to talk about the beers we are featuring without actually tasting them and ......I'm pretty wound up. ..**General:** Are y'all watching Luke Cage? .....pretty good
**Triumph:** I finally got what felt like a good night's sleep last night. I was able to get up early with my SO made my lunch (no spending money on eating out for me today!) and got to work a half hour early. Considering I'm usually 15-30 minutes late this is huge for me. Also week 1 complete!..**Struggle:** I'm behind on some things at work that I have no good excuse for being behind on other than procrastination. It's definitely stressing me out and making me feel like a huge failure in the professional world but one life change at a time I guess...**General:** I'm feeling pretty good physically. I got to the rock gym last night for the first time in months and it felt great. I've also got roller derby try outs coming up which I'm pumped to go into as a sober person.
Triumph - at day 45 not craving alcohol. ..Struggle - feeling really ill the last few days. Nerves in my face hurt 3 grumbling wisdom teeth headache just feel shitty. Seems bugs can live in me now I'm not pickled every day. ..General - doing good.  Hoping this shitty feeling passes so I can get back in the gym. Hate missing a day even more 2! It's part of my recovery and my routine. 
Triumph: I got 99 days and didn't drink 1 hit me!.  I'm at 99 days not to shabby if I do say so myself.  I've lost weight figured out I'm still fun at parties sober I was able to put $500 in the stock market (could be doing better there but I know how it rolls in that world.) It's getting cooler out and winter will be here soon. ..Struggle:  Done goofed at work this morning and forgot my access badge had to call the shadow people that watch over the company and get them to let me in then they called my boss and his boss so eventually the big boss came in and got me a temp badge printed up.  It wasn't a huge deal but I still feel like an ass. ..General:  I found inspiration for sobriety in the writings of Stephen King I saw way to much of myself in the grownup version of Danny Torrence.  It inspired me to start writing again will I make a million dollars doing it? probably not.  Does it make me happy? certainly. 
Triumph: I admitted my alcohol problem to others..Struggle: Stopping and changing my habits and reward system..General: My sister in law is driving her from Ohio and she is such a Gem I am very excited to see her later today oh and my step son won his baseball game last night  they played so good like real team mates (they are 10-11 years)!. .
**Triumph:** I'm sleeping better and feeling more confident.. .**Struggle:** We're finishing a house remodel that has gone waaaay over time and some over budget...**General:** The remainder of college football season is going to be very different without alcohol. And by very different I mean it won't carry the negative repercussions that followed the majority of the first half games. Looking so forward to travelling to see my team over the next two months.
Triumph: I have maintained my commitment to long on to SD daily and it really does make a difference...Struggle: recurring thoughts of drinking this weekend. I re-frame them and I am developing a solid plan but I have been fighting this fight for at least 12 years (with some years of sobriety) and the battle is wearisome. ..General: Fall. Good lord so happy it is Fall. Love the weather love the start of the holiday season.
**Triumph** ...28 days! 49 days since I started one relapse and 28 days straight sober. ...**Struggle** ...Just got divorced. (Ex)Husband left this past saturday amid many tears and expressions of love and regret. He left a bottle of vodka in the house. I stopped at the store to get mix. I didn't park. I drove into the parking lot turned around went home and dumped the whole bottle. Every day is a struggle. Every night is sleepless. I will not drink through this. ....**General**...Overall feeling better healthier more emotionally stable. I feel like crap when I drink I feel like crap the morning after drinking. There's no upside and I'm gratefully I can finally see clearly enough to recognize that.
**Triumph:** I am on a week-long mindfulness meditation streak! Something I have been wanting to implement in my life for a long long time but was always too drunk or high to follow through for the most part. I even got up early to meditate BEFORE work today which is huge cause I usually roll out of bed at the last second...**Struggle:** I have been completely and utterly exhausted the past 2 days for some reason and it's only the beginning of the week. I have a busy rest of the week planned and it's going to take a lot of energy and effort to make it through it all...**General:** I have smoked weed a couple times recently and am noticing lingering effects of grogginess and fuzzy-headedness. It's a confirmation to me that the totally sober path is the one I want to be on. I feel SO much better when I don't participate in any mind-altering substances!
**Triumph:** Over 130 days... support network is strong! ..**Struggle:** I still have invasive thoughts of wanting to drink. I am coming to realize that I am not one of those people whose drinking caused their problems. I drank to hide my problems. It "worked" until the alcohol also started causing problems...**General:** Oh hi problems. There sure are a lot of you. What the hell.
Hi Mary. Thanks for taking over What's up Wednesday and for your post which I enjoyed reading. I've visited the Palace of Fine Art in San Francisco and have an album full of photos of it. It's awesome. I'm sure you will have many wonderful opportunities ahead to go see wonderful sights. Like you I regret how alcohol limited my life and opportunities when I placed it at the forefront. Still we can look forward to great things to come when we stay sober. Of this I'm certain. .Anyhow here goes: Triumph: I am continuing to declutter my garage and build my Xmas hamper. Back in the day I couldn't do either without gulping down wine to give me fortitude. I am doing things slowly but they are getting done.Yay....Struggle: Losing weight is not as easy as I thought it would be as a non drinker. When I had five years sobriety my weight was fine. This timeI have struggled to lose the tummy. So have resorted to the GI diet. I will keep you posted on my success..or lack of...?.General: I'm a happy bunny. Grateful for many things. Glad to know you peeps here on SD. This community is a real life saver. Sending all my fellow sobernauts best wishes:-)
**Triumph:**  66 days!  I was finally able to pick up my chip so that was pretty cool.  It was my first we agnostics meeting and it was pretty great.  I was curious to check it out since my spiritual side is all over the damn place which ultimately just confuses me and leads me back out.  Also been getting the creative juices flowing again lately which I am pretty happy about...**Struggle:**  Financially in a shit place due to living in an expensive city.  Anxiety levels and social paranoia are high lately.  No motivation.  I feel like my depression/alcoholism is just spying on me from the shadows waiting for the right moment to strike me down with despair and drink.  No appetite and fatigued.  haha I think that will do it... Onward and upward though!  It builds character...**General:**  I am enlightened once again through music!  It is simply the best.  I can actually enjoy the subtle complexities of it all once again without the fog.  I've been going to the record shops and getting some stuff with money that I most certainly would have spent on alcohol.  
**T**: I have almost reached 500 days and I can honestly say I have no cravings to drink. I remember how awful I used to feel all the time and I never want to be back there again!..**S**: I was recently diagnosed with Hashimoto's an auto-immune disease that causes my hypothyroidism. I don't know how long I've had it because my drinking masked or worsened my symptoms. I'm now on a gluten free no/low sugar and limited dairy diet. Ugh! All my favorite things! I haven't been able to ride my bike lately because I fell and bruised a bone in my hand so I've been feeling really sluggish lately...**G**: I once missed They Might Be Giants because I was drinking and I completely forgot I had tickets... 
**Triumph:** day 6 :)..**Struggle:** I hate work even though I should be happy (good money/benefits lots of holidays)..**General:** I feel like I should start to look for something to do in the evenings...
T:  Plugging away at nursing school...S:  Sisters bday party comming up Dad invited me to go to the Chicago.   Booze will be involved in both.   ..G:  The leaves are changing and falling.   The temperature is awesome.   
[removed]
**Triumph:** Some movement (hopefully) on the job front...one organization is writing a job description "for me" another is excited I applied for a new position with them (I've worked with them as a community partner before) and two intro interviews this week.  Come on Universe -- crack it open!  ..**Struggle:** Despite the movement worried about money and finding good work.  SO lied to me again about drinking; struggling with what to do about my relationship...**General:** The Cubs won their division -- NL Championship here we come!
Triumph: this week I ran and hosted a comedy night without touching any of the free beers. And I just got back from headlining a gig in London. Sober. It feels insane but great so great. I went swimming for the first time in ages and just won a few coins on a scratch card so using those to go swimming again tomorrow. Also downloaded the headspace app and getting into ten minutes of meditation a day. Been a top week so far!..Struggle: the mood swings. I'm riding high right now but I can feel the inevitable crash coming hoping a swim tomorrow will soften the landing...General: the disabled guy I work/care for has gotten me into wrestling. Every Wednesday we watch smackdown together and I'm hooked. It's like RuPaul's drag race with worse acting challenges and smaller costumes.
Triumph: Nearly 10 days! ..Struggle: I've started smoking a couple cigarettes in the evening to distract myself from drinking. :( Also have a 10 day trip starting tomorrow. ..General:  One this week I watched several health documentaries on alcohol and drug use which normally I would have avoided since I was still drinking - and it was as terrifying as expected but was added fuel to keep on this path since I'm a bit of a hypochondriac.  .And two I beginning to think I need to start thinking of things I want out of life in addition to what I need to quit doing in life.  Does that make sense?
Triumph: Tomorrow is my 180th day sober!..Struggle: Still struggling with anxiety and depression but more manageable at six months sober than it ever has been and I know it will continue to improve...General: I am going to enjoy my last two days of time off from work! I've accomplished a lot so far: lots of cleaning homework exercise but mostly just plenty of sleep and relaxation. 
**Triumph:** Think I did pretty well on a pathology test and I stayed in a good mood the whole day. Also I got to sleep in (it's the little things). ..**Struggle:** Still feeling guilty and beating myself up about my last blackout binge this past weekend. It's really motivating me to stick with the whole "no alcohol" and self improvement though...**General:** Realized where my friends and drinking "friends" really stand to where I've gotten the real support for my journey which is both a triumph and a struggle! So I figured it'd go well here in General. I'm realizing I have to rebuild my life's foundation with a stronger support system that sets me up for success and not failure.
