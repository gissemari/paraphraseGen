Soon 30 days clean and I need some encouraging words to stay away from relapsing. Are you most likely to get back into your old bad habits only after one relapse DIRECTLY?

Can't really give a definitive answer because each person is different. For me it takes a little bit. 
You are most likely to get into your old bad habits when you engage in the patterns of behaviors assiciated with drinking...When I stopped I recognized I had patterns habits and triggers...There's an oft quoted phrase: "Dry people Dry places."  ...Here are my thoughts about how I might be [Pavlovs Dog](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/4f3fqu/i_think_im_pavlovs_dog/)...I changed my patterns especially right after work and in the evening which was my weakest point and my traditional drink wine scenario...I went to a meeting right after work exercised ate dinner went to an 800 pm meeting came home and went to bed...That broke my broke my patterns which eliminated my cravings..
I believe the recovery wisdom: we are slow learners and fast forgetters apply to relapse.  What I had to do was totally take alcohol out of daily decision-making with that first conscious choice each morning.  How?  For me it was the [simple actions at the Baby Steps post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)
I'm not sure that there is a definitive answer to this. If you search this sub by "relapse" or "reset" you'll see that some people come back after a day some people come back after year(s) some people relapse many many times and some people disappear. ..Something I read here a while back that's helped me: I know I have another drunk in me I don't know if I have another recovery.
A bottle of wine turned into a 4 month whiskey bender now I'm working on Day 6 again. I never want another drink again.
My personal experience with relapse went 95 days sober then 6 months drinking more than I ever did while I was drinking before back to here...So...yeah. I allowed myself to let things get much much worse after I gave up the first time...
It is a lot easier to just not do it.  Hang tight.

For me it is exponentially easier to stay stopped than it is to stop. My experience with relapse is that "Just one glass of wine and I'll start over tmrw" turned into a 9 month bender of pure misery. If I could turn back time I would have saved myself that living hell by never picking up that first drink. 
As I said in another thread some of us are like alcohol virtuosos. We can put down the instrument for years but when we pick it back up the notes are right there under our fingertips. We only need a little warmup period and we're back at peak form...We can't be alcohol-naive anymore. Our bodies and metabolism remember. They spent many years developing an efficient system for dealing with ethanol in the blood stream. That system will be quickly re-activated...(Much experience with "moderation" schemes one week into my most recent quit)
