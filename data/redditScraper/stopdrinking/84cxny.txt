Has anyone here had experience with alcohol and benzo addiction? I am struggling with quitting alcohol which is the first major step before beginning a benzo taper and honestly the road seems so long.

I had to quit benzos because my supply ran dry so I went cold turkey and it was the most hellish experience of my life. Tapering is definitely the way to go! You may also want to seek medical help - benzo withdrawal can be very dangerous.
I don't but I'd go see my doctor for help with that.  I mostly just saw that you might like some support.  I've got that!  Keep looking seek and you shall find just don't give up   I will not drink with you today friend 
Here to say that I have been taking Xanax for 10 years and went from taking 60mg a month in November of last year to taking 5mg a month! 2mg a day to .25 every other day or so...I NEVER thought it'd be possible- but definitely do it under medical supervision. I have been sober from alcohol for 4 and last month at my first try had 25 days...I feel so amazing anc clear headed. I'm here to talk if you have any questions.
