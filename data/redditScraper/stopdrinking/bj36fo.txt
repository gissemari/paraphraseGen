I have been struggling trying to get back to sober living. Longest is a year but for the last 2 years it's been on and off. Im committed to staying sober this time. Im on a business trip to San Francisco I used to live here and it always causes me anxiety coming back as it's a city I love and was heartbroken to leave. ..We had a team dinner last night and I passed on the wine. I'm now enjoying a sober morning with a view of the bay and I couldn't be happier with my choice to pass on wine last night. I can now enjoy the day in a city I love with clear eyes a clear head and pride that I'm back on the road to a sober life!..IWNDWYT!
