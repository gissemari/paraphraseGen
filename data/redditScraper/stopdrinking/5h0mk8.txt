Hi all. I posted this in the AlAnon subreddit but I figured I'd share it here as well because Stop Drinking is a much larger community and may be able to offer some more insight. Please let me know if this post isn't appropriate for this subreddit in any way and I'll remove it...My dad is a recovering alcoholic. He's currently about four months sober after about a year and a half of extremely heavy daily drinking that nearly killed him and pretty much tore our family apart in the process. I was away at school at the time so I didn't have to deal with the deteriorating situation at home but it absolutely tore my mother apart especially when she found out that he has been cheating on her with a much younger woman...My dad finally quit after that year and a half period. I don't know exactly what caused him to stop. Anyway he got sober started talking antidepressants and naltrexone got a new job and seems to be living life the same way he was before he started drinking super heavily. So it's been about four months my mom seems hopeful and I was at first until I learned that he's still cheating on her...My dad is super protective of his cell phone. He doesn't leave it anywhere he doesn't let anyone touch it it's on him 24/7. He's carried on this behavior from when he was drinking and it's raised a huge red flag (I think my mom noticed it as well but I feel like she's willing to ignore it because it's easier for her that way). Anyway by some miracle he left it at home while running errands or something and I went through his texts and he's been talking to the same woman he cheated on my mom with during that year. I know this because I went through his texts once during that time as well. She told him to come over with a bottle of vodka. This was pretty alarming to read to say the least. My dad came home soon after and I listened as he called her and told her he was coming over. My mom was at work at the time...I don't know how long he's been seeing this woman or if he ever stopped but I have a feeling she's strongly linked to his drinking habit. I don't know what to think. Is he headed for a relapse? I know he started going to smart recovery meetings during the first month of his sobriety but I don't think he is anymore. I don't know if he's still taking the naltrexone either or really going to therapy at all. I guess the bottom line is that I seriously don't trust him and I don't know what to do. I don't want my dad to relapse but I feel like it's inevitable. Or is it?..Thanks for reading this far I really appreciate it. Any words of advice are super helpful.

I don't know how much drama it would create but maybe contact that woman and let her know what she is doing. Your old man might be hiding all of this from her and she is completely unaware of the severity of the situation. This is what I would do any way. From there I would call out my dad. He might get butt hurt but one day he will appreciate what you did. This is just me and what I would do knowing MY family.
Sorry to hear you are in a tough spot but it's great to hear that you're interested in supporting your dad in sobriety. Is there any way you can have a day together or go grab lunch or see a movie? Just spending time together can help and if you feel like it you can tell him how much you love hanging out with him sober. Just let him know you're there! ..As for his potential relationship with this other woman I don't believe that children should ever be in the position where they feel they have to control or manage their parents lives. If it really worries you have a conversation with him about it.  Who knows maybe your mom knows and they have some sort of understanding. It'll be a hard conversation and may seem unthinkable but it's a clear path forward.
