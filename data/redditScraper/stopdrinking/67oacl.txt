I love the clarity that day 4 brings me!  My mind is sharper my skin is less red my senses are open and an overall nice feeling comes over me.  Overall it has been 14/18 days sober (I've screwed up every weekend).  Each week it has been easier and easier to get to Day 4.  Thank you again to each person on this site for sharing their stories they have helped me stay strong so far.  To those that are starting over...it seems to be easier to stay sober a little longer after each relapse.  Keep your head up if you drank yesterday and come back here for support and head to a few meetings to get back on the to where you want to be.

Hey 14/18 days is a big accomplishment! I found going on walks to be really helpful in the first few days. Whenever I wanted to drink I was out the door walking until I was exhausted. 
Good effort! I will not drink with you today!
