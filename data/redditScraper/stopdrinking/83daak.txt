I struggle with patience.  Getting what I want when I want is still a personality defect.  Anyway when I decided to quit drinking 2 years ago I was scared.  Drinking was what I did.  I met my husband at a bar.  We had a bar in our garage.  Family gatherings were about mimosas opening the next bottle of wine and short ones (usually whiskey or tequila).  My brothers husband sister-in-laws were rowdy and we loved hanging out.  My closest friends and their husbands stayed over to wee hours in the morning drinking the beer from our built in keg filled with home brew.  Anyway I miss social gatherings but I don't miss alcohol.  This post is going somewhere....I was scared but I started to think of the positive without alcohol.  I decided I was getting fixed....no more babies...and I was getting a 2 door jeep wrangler soft top manual.  It didn't matter that is wasn't going to fit my family of 5.  So life sober was looking up.  Relationships mended and my hunt for my jeep that would symbolize my freedom began and two weeks ago I bought my jeep. Peace. https://imgur.com/FDKzm5d
