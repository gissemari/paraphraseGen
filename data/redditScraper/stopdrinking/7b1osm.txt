Hello everyone..I stopped drinking about 7 years ago and it's the best thing I've ever done...Today for whatever reason I'm struggling with all the guilt and shame all over again. In particular I'm thinking of nights from over ten years ago. It's nothing crazy mostly just embarrassing and inappropriate stuff but still is paralyzing me with guilt today. Depression and anxiety are things I deal with daily but this today is really troubling me...I never tried to make amends in the past as I'm not entirely sure it's a good idea. I've told my spouse everything that I did and though she agrees it was shitty she doesn't think I should beat myself up over it to this day...I'm not afraid of relapsing thankfully. I know that will just make things worse.  I do wish I could forgive myself. I feel like I've disappointed my family and friends even though they don't all know the details. I just feel like I've fallen short...I'm doing my best to be the type of person I want to be. I'm so glad I left the booze behind.  I'm just hoping to let go of these feelings as I'm really not living my best life when this hits...How have some of you dealt with this?

I have made some amends and not others. I find that I seem to have some peace about things where I have made amends and the things where I have not it still bothers me...I will admit that some of the amends not made are because I don't know how to address it now after so much time has passed. And those seem to still bother me...Plus individual counseling has helped me greatly. 
I almost look at my drinking self as another person. Fair or unfair. Ive admitted things I did to myself and apologized to people it made sense to. I'm a different person now. Hate the things I have done but I'm actively doing things to make sure they don't happen again. ..
