When I used to drink I often blacked out and lost entire portions of evenings. I genuinely believed this happened to everyone and that it was just part of getting drunk. Near the end I recognized that no not everyone had to fake it hard the next day when questioned about how they enjoyed the party. And if they did it was most certainly not with the frequency or disregard that I had...My cousin got married this weekend and I was in the bridal party. Most of the others were her sorority sisters and friends from college and they like to drink. A LOT as I discovered. In the limo from the church to the reception a continuous stream of bottles of hard liquor just circled around the limo. "Take a swig pass it along." Each person was also double-fisting a glass of champagne and a can of beer. My older cousin eventually noticed that I was passing on everything and scrounged through the cooler in the back until he found a lone soda hiding at the bottom. On that 20 minute drive the others polished off 4 bottles of hard liquor at least a case of beer and two bottles of champagne. I seriously didn't know how any of them were standing for the picture-taking afterward. ..And then I thought "Oh my god. If I was still drinking I'd have been a thousand times worse by now. It would have been so easy to reach for more and more unnoticed." The idea was like shovel to the face. A wave of relief so palpable washed over me that it felt like a cool breeze (an amazingly welcome feeling when standing outside in a floor-length gown on a 80 degree day). I wouldn't have to worry about what jibberish I said to who where I left my glasses purse...etc. or if I started yet another argument with my husband--the one who often tried to steer me from drinking when I was getting out of control or making a fool of myself and took the most verbal abuse for it. Instead I laughed for hours with my family got to dance with my husband and see him feeling proud of me and most of all got to remember every single moment of a beautiful and joyful day. There were a few moments where I was at the bar getting a cocktail for my husband and even though the thought of downing a quick one and hiding it occurred once or twice I never gave it consideration. I just reminded myself "I decided not to drink today. I am living sober now."..I had breakfast with my family the next morning without any tension or fear. And when I looked at the pictures from the evening I most certainly looked "joyous happy and free." I will remember this feeling when I am struggling because I am so grateful to be experiencing life fully now.
