Last night I got my first [chip](http://i.imgur.com/6UCAhRc.png) at an AA meeting. 60 days. I felt a lot of support from the group which was needed last night. There have been many moments this last week where I have convinced myself that I am not a problem drinker and could handle moderation. I try to make myself believe this quite a lot lately...I don't know if it is this particular meeting place or not but AA hasn't sold itself to me yet. Obviously I understand the contradiction when I say above that the group support was appreciated. I'm not looking for someone to sell me on the idea of AA just letting you know my own thoughts...Last night a homeless dude was at the meeting and he shared a list of his transgressions including a kidnapping felony and adding that he has 20 children. He threatened suicide and vaguely threatened violence against the group. He then said something along the lines of "who gives a fuck about drinking when I am going to kill myself tonight?". The gist of his rambling 10 minute message was that he was a very dangerous man to be feared about to kill himself and that being concerned about drinking is a luxury and that we were all concerned about trivial things. Awesome. I wanted to yell at him to shut the fuck up and take it elsewhere and then felt like a terrible person about that...I talked to a younger dude doing the post meeting 1:1 for the first time after 4 meetings. I asked him about finding a sponsor and how that works. He took my number said he would call me today. He honestly seemed to care. He took me outside to meet some people and as much as I wanted to try and chat to them I had to leave. The problem is that they were all outside smoking. I quit smoking 500+ days ago (thanks to /r/stopsmoking) but it is often a struggle to stay quit. We all know the comfort of a having a drink in hand when chatting to strangers.. well a smoke in hand is the same thing. The last thing I need when trying to find mental peace from quitting booze is to re-introduce the tension that smoking brings to my life. Everyone at this club house seems to smoke and if I hang out after meetings with the smokers I know I'll be smoking soon.  ..A lot of the sharing at meetings has been meta sharing about how AA has helped people turn their lives around. Almost all of it in fact. The best guess I can come up with right now is that AA is really about the time after the meetings. The meetings themselves dont seem to be a massive resource to me yet but I see all these small groups forming after the meetings and I am sure that the support network that people form together is the actual process of AA that makes the difference. ..I struggle to join a group already formed. I am not the "hey can I join you?" guy. I am a solitary beast and so for me AA seems a little like an impenetrable clique. I understand though that taking that step to let down my weird lonely defenses and joining AA becoming part of the group fitting in honestly.. will be a huge step in my recovery. I just don't see a lot of people or ideas I think I will identify with in this particular group...The stories in this group I have heard have all been way more extreme than mine. Arrests losing children losing jobs prison forced rehab. None of this has been my experience and my own struggle seems incomplete and silly to me in this group. There is a lot of much harder living than my own...I'm stuck being a mediocre drunk worried about playing in the big leagues...
----------immediate responses--------

There will always be someone with bigger problems than yourself. Even if you had lost everything ruined everything and were friendless and physically injured there would still be someone worse off. You just started recovery earlier...I have never permanently injured someone or myself drunk (apart from a scar on my finger). But if I continue then I am sure I'd get there eventually. You can be a functional alcoholic for a while and the mileage will wary some make it years some only a few weeks. Still it is probably better to address your issues now rather than after you've lost children got arrested lost jobs and get forced to rehab.
Hi.  Congrats on your 60.  ..I had a somewhat similar reaction to the AA meetings I went to.  I stopped going but that's not why.  In fact my reaction almost made me keep going and I'll tell you why.  It's kind of a long story but it helps me to type it out even if no one ever reads this.  .."I'm not nearly as bad off as THOSE GUYS" is what my dad has now told us that he said about the first Gamblers Anonymous meetings he went to 20 years ago.  20 years ago my dad still had [most of] the retirement savings he and my mom worked for their entire lives.  He still had the house I grew up in. He still had my elderly grandmother's (she passed away before all this came to light thank Universe) savings.  He still had the respect of his church community because he was in charge of their fundraising efforts.  He still had a clean criminal record.  Most important to me anyway (I know it's selfish...) he still had my unquestioning respect devotion and even a little bit of hero worship.  ..Today he has none of those things.  He's been in Gamblers Anonymous and working the steps for five months.  So that's great.  But now he is as bad off as "THOSE GUYS."  If he had stayed in those meetings... no use crying over spilled milk but... he and my mom are in their late 60s.  Starting over with less than nothing.  I only see my parents once a year because they live far away and can't afford to come out here. And all sorts of other negative repercussions I won't get into because that's his stuff not mine.  ..So when I caught myself thinking "I'm not as bad as THOSE GUYS" I tried to remember that my father - who I literally modeled myself on in sooo many ways - said that exact thing.  At the point when he could have stopped himself from being one of THOSE GUYS.  ..Honestly probably the worst repercussions of my drinking are things that people who are not me would have trouble seeing.  I never got a DUI or lost a job or worse because of drinking.  I just... felt like crap a lot and wore myself out arguing with myself about drinking or not drinking when I could have the next drink how could I conform to the moderation rules I laid out in front of met etc.  So no story along the lines of what I heard at the AA meetings.  ..Actually one time I had my prejudices confirmed a little bit.  I spoke up about my experiences (I now understand that noobs really aren't supposed to talk that much I think?? but I was unconsciously treating it like a grad school seminar where silence is taken as an insult to the group).  I got kind of attacked by... well.... by one of "THOSE GUYS."  He sort of told me my problem wasn't serious and/or I wasn't taking it seriously (I'm not 100% sure I got what he was saying and I am quite positive he meant well).  And as a young(er) professional woman in a pretty conservative/backwards geographical area I must admit that I feel I have met my life quotient of getting talked down to by older men so I didn't love that experience.  ..So my response is ultimately kind of contradictory:  the AA meetings don't do it for me right now.  But I'm not ruling them out.  Because for the first time in my life I don't want to become my dad.  :( ..Basically I'm trying not to overthink it.  And I'm trying just not to drink.  ..I didn't mean to hijack your thread; I just related to so much of what you wrote!  Anyway I just passed my 60 days too and it's a big deal and congratulations again.  ...
