I'm in the middle of a big move. The apartment is full of stuff everywhere and the baby is screaming uncontrollably more than usual. The tension between my SO and I is crazy as we both feel like we're in over our heads and feel like we won't make it. We're stressed out to the max...I was struggling to see anything positive at all because the timing of events is just as unfortunate as usual but when I realised I am sober and doing all of this I felt overwhelmed by a calm - and I know all will be good. I don't even care that I'm too fed up with AA to consider going to a meeting. Wow! It really is powerful stuff. What a gift to be able to see the positives of being sober in these rough times...152 days today. Thanks to all of you and keep doing the right things.

Awesome! You certainly don't want a hangover on top of all that chaos! Great work!
Keep uo the great work!  Moving is the worst (like the physical act of moving all stuff). Stay strong!  Will be awesome once your settled in a new place.
