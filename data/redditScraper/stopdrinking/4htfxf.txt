...IT IS NOT WORTH IT. ..I would be approaching 100 days had I just fought a little bit harder. Instead things are slipping back...Time for me to start again...Take care of yourselves.

Sorry to hear that. Please don't give up I've been reading your posts and can tell you were going in the right direction and can do it again. welcome back!
Glad you're here!  Some don't make it back...Have any plans to make it different?
Wondered where you went Andy.  I became accustomed to seeing your posts.  Glad you are back. 
Your fight got you back here. We all belong here.
Thank you for posting.. I offer you STRENGTH .  I feel your pain as I was there also...IT IS NOT WORTH IT.
I'm glad you made it back friend. Don't be too hard on yourself we all struggle. 
Thanks for posting this message. Welcome back to the good place. 
Thanks for reminding me it's not worth it. It's been getting difficult. Welcome back :) 
I can't seem to get any real momentum going.  I'm strong for several days and then find some weak excuse to allow my self to drink.  Usually just for a day or two and then I'm back here.  You did your body so much good by being sober for as long as you did.  Please don't beat yourself up too badly.  I'm envious of how long you went.  I think for me one of the hardest things to get through is thinking of myself as someone with the disease of alcoholism.  I haven't yet accepted that and I fear that is why I keep falling back on wine to self medicate.
Hi thanks for posting I really enjoyed reading your posts about changing our relationship and perspective on alcohol.
