Hello r/stopdrinking I am Miss Pavlov and I am an alcoholic...Today I completed and was discharged from a 14 day intensive inpatient treatment and it remains to be the best decision I have ever made for myself. I am incredibly grateful to have had the opportunity. The personal awakening and education I received are invaluable experiences that will become the foundations on my journey in sobriety and recovery...Before I said enough was enough and admitted to needing help I was a long time lurker of this thread. Your stories struggles and thoughts have always been inspirational to me. I plan on becoming more active on this sub and contributing using this as yet another tool in the sobriety toolbox. ..So Hello. Happy 24hrs everyone.

Hello to you too and congrats on your success in rehab! I too was helped greatly by rehab...I'm sensing a certain confidence and determination in your sobriety...and I admire it!
Congrats. I wish you the best going forward and strongly suggest you do your best to keep the momentum of recovery moving forward. Whatever support you seek it is important to keep seeking and accepting help. It's astonishing how quickly we forget the pain of what led us to quit in the first place and rationalize our way back into a drink. Continued support from other sober alcoholics is the best (and only) way I've found to keep these justifications and the subsequent relapse at bay.
