I just found this subreddit a week or so ago. I've commented on some posts but feel the need to make my own post as I'm really struggling right now...I am 40 and I was recently diagnosed with PTSD from childhood sexual abuse. I have spent my whole adult life trying to avoid the feelings of shame hurt anger sadness etc. One of my biggest coping mechanisms has been alcohol. I've been a heavy drinker since college...Now that I'm in therapy for my PTSD it's really becoming clear to me how much alcohol is adding to my pain. I'm able to avoid drinking fairly easily when my symptoms feel under control. But it's really hard not to drink when all the painful emotions I've been stuffing down forever start bubbling up. I see clearly now how alcohol makes it worse though. It increases my anxiety makes me tired makes me feel guilty makes me feel sick etc. It definitely increases the PTSD symptoms...I'm not going to get better unless I stop drinking. I know this. Today has been really hard and I feel very overwhelmed. But I will not drink with you today.
