At a gathering with my functioning alcoholic family. Someone just handed me a glass of champagne and I took a sip. I'm practically hyperventilating right now and I dont want to break. It's been a really crappy Christmas Day so far and I'm feeling so anxious. ..I'm sorry I'm really struggling and I've been so happy the past three weeks. But I'm also a people pleaser and don't know if I can get out of this one. I don't want this to set me off again. I will not be that bee in the pitcher plant. I don't want to slide...Sorry again for the vent. Thanks for listening!

It's ok!  I understand the people pleasing/not wanting to create conflict or discomfort for other people.  But that's truly not your problem and right now that isn't the priority.  Is there somewhere you can step outside and take some deep breaths?  Run an errand for someone and go to the store?  I feel you.  Not drinking with you today!  You can get through this.  
i'm sorry! any way you can go for a walk?
Stay strong. My mother has offered me wine 6 times so far today. I won't drink with you. 
You can do this! I'm right there with you friend 
Keep up the fight! We are with you. Did you tell them that you weren't drinking today? You don't have to tell them that you're quitting for good just that you aren't drinking today? Maybe because of a medication or that you're driving or "hung over" of anything to get them to stop offering 
Greetings my 21 day twin.  I think that when you make it through today you'll have done this HUGE great thing that no one can ever take away from you.  What a fantastic gift to ourselves being sober today is.
