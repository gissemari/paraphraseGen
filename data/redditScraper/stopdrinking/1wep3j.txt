So this might sound a little cheesy but Marcus Luttrell (Lone Survivor) has been such an inspiration to my sobriety. I think alot of people feel the same way. His will to live and his determination to work hard for what he wanted make my struggle with drink/drugs seem minute. The fact he has even shared his story is proof to me that he is determined to recover and share his experience with those who may benefit. I am currently putting together a letter of thanks to Marcus and a donation for the Lone Survivor Foundation. Its a two way street. I am curious about people who inspire you guys to better yourselves. Who are they and what are their stories?

I haven't seen that movie but I can totally relate.  Hearing about others' stories of overcoming adversities staring down their demons it inspires.  I guess that is why we (humans) tell stories and have since forever.  It's how we know who we are.  Awesome...Thanks for sharing. I'm going to be sure to take that movie in before too long...As for people whose stories inspire me I'll get back to you on that.  I'm sure there are plenty but I want to think about it...Interesting post.  I'm looking forward to seeing other people's responses.  Thanks for sharing.
I'm on my phone so I can't link to it but when I first posted here I mentioned two people who I know IRL who provided me with motivation to stop first of all...But other than that my father. It might sound rude and I do love him but I just don't want to live his life. He drank for most of my life until switching to NA beer sometime when I was in high school. There was a long period of unemployment in there (he hurt himself as a fireman) and now we actually work at the same store. He was never abusive but was never very pleasant to be around either and he did change much for the better when he stopped drinking. But I want to live a very different life than he did (and I think he'd want the same for me).
