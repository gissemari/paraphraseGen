Hey everyone I love you guys and I love your posts. ..For anyone struggling in the early days keep going. Life gets better we get better...I still have tough days and moments as I learn a new way to live who I am and what I want. I'm outside of a relationship for the first time in my life which is very challenging but my outlook moods and coping skills improve every day at I work hard at getting better...Sending you good vibes!
