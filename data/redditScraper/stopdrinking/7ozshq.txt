I posted here a while back looking for guidance as someone who was struggling with alcohol but didn't know whether I had to quit   https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/7j3qzf/my_drinking_is_a_problem_and_i_dont_know_what_to/..I have since tried to drink in moderation by cutting out hard liquor and sticking to only wine and beer. I did ok for a little while. But it didn't last. Observing this new beer-and-wine-only rule I still managed to get near-blackout wasted and have an embarrassing public meltdown. ..My significant other more or less told me I needed to quit or we're done because he can't deal with it anymore. I don't blame him. I can't deal with myself anymore. I'm tired of the self-loathing and shame. So I'm done. I am earnestly committing myself to sobriety. ..I'm a few days in and it has been extremely difficult. I constantly feel the need for relief but know it's not an option for me. I'm trying to soothe myself in healthy ways   doing yoga every day exercising more. It's no replacement for booze...The other thing is I have no sober friends. None. And I don't think I can do this alone. I've tried quitting many times in the past and always failed I think in large part because I had absolutely no support system and was surrounded by friends who drink. I'm hesitant to go to AA because like I said in my previous post I don't identify as an alcoholic...I know the only requirement for attending AA is the desire to quit drinking and I'm sure everyone there would be very welcoming and kind but I'm afraid I would be out of place...Lastly: Does anyone have any tips for being around alcohol and maintaining close relationships with people who drink during these early stages of quitting? I'm sure it'll get easier but right now it's torture for me to be around booze. And my significant other drinks. I can't ask him to not drink around me   we live together so we're around each other all the time. And he's unwilling to stop going to bars himself. He's always asking how he can support me but the only thing he could truly do that could help it seems is not drink around me and that seems to be out of the question. I know it's selfish and unrealistic to expect anyone to re-orient their lives around my needs. This is my shit and I need to learn how to deal with it...Thanks in advance for your help.

You wouldnt be out of place. In fact you wouldnt have to mention your drinking habits. Nobody has ever questioned me. Good luck. 
&gt;My significant other more or less told me I needed to quit or we're done because he can't deal with it anymore...In my experience I had to stop drinking for *myself*. I had to put my oxygen mask on first before I could be with anyone or help anyone else...&gt;I've tried quitting many times in the past and always failed I think in large part because I had absolutely no support system and was surrounded by friends who drink. I'm hesitant to go to AA because like I said in my previous post I don't identify as an alcoholic...I know the only requirement for attending AA is the desire to quit drinking and I'm sure everyone there would be very welcoming and kind but I'm afraid I would be out of place...Wisdom right here. You said it. I also had to build a sober support system and seek out different paths to sobriety including recovery groups. ..[Here's the inside scoop](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index#wiki_what_happens_at_a_.5Bwhatever_recovery_group.5D_meeting.3F) on what happens at a recovery group meeting ;)...shhhhh!!! ;).
If he means what he says about supporting you then he maybe could accommodate you in some way maybe by not drinking in the house during these early days? Have you spoken to him about it? Or could you suggest you do dry January together you may feel a little stronger after that. A lot of my work colleagues are doing dry Jan as well so they are being supportive without even knowing that they are! I'm not sure I could have done the last week if my SO had been drinking in front of me. I'm no expert and only a week in myself. As the person above said I'm sure AA would welcome you. Good luck you can do this. I will not drink with you today.  
&gt;I'm afraid I would I would be out of place...Who knows?  Can't say until experiencing it...Here's how I look at - there's no admission fee the only cost is my time.  I don't have to say anything other than   I'd just like to listen .  You can leave whenever you want...When I was struggling I tried anything!..Worked for me.
