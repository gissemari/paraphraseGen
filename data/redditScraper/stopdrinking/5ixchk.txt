Yesterday that thought came to mind. And it always comes and goes from time to time. I know that if I start drinking this time maybe i'll end up dead or ODing because I always do a lot of coke when i'm drunk alcohol and coke just go hand by hand to me. ..I don't now how to react sometimes and i think i have social anxiety cause i get strees out with people even if they don't talk to me. Alcohol helped me with that. Made me feel like a functional human being in this dumb society...Now i'm sober for more than a month again after a bad relapse more. I was a year sober and in the final month i almost lose my mind. I feel like i'm the same depressed guy sober or drunk. Maybe a like more calm sober because i don't spend all of my money in a week. ..I just don't see the point in all of this. Just feel lost in life and all that.  I don't know if i will be sober the rest of my life but TODAY I WILL NOT DRINK. Just take it  day by day maybe something awesome will come. Who really knows.

I think the world record for sober is 24 hours!..I"m almost done...Today I forgo just ONE drink - The First One..If Today proceeds like Yesterday I'll do the same thing Tomorrow
I sometimes listen to [Leo from YouTube](https://www.actualized.org/categories/emotions) just to get out of myself for a bit. Worth a look as he has a covered a lot of things. All free - all on you tube too.
