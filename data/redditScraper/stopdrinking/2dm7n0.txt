So I got sober in December of 2010 and that was the best thing that ever happened to me. But then two months ago I experienced some troubles in my life that got the better of me and I decided to start drinking again. Ive been ok so far but everything that is said about alcoholism sneaking up on you is true. It finally caught up to me and I just got off of a bender that snapped me back into the right perspective. I never did like AA so I went searching online to find some support to get back into sobriety and I found SD. Ive really appreciated what Ive read so far and I decided to join up. Thanks everybody.

I'm glad you've decided to get sober again! This place really is a fantastic resource filled with amazing people and interacting here regularly has been instrumental for me.  I hope you'll stick around and I'm sure you'll find the same thing...If you'd like you can request a badge on the sidebar that tracks your progress day by day.  It's by no means necessary but most people here (myself included) find it kind of rewarding.

I am glad you seem unscathed at least on a felony/ICU level...Welcome.  SD will be a big help post early and often.  But my experience is that there is great value in face to face interactions with similar sodden sorts.  You might check out Smart recovery or shop around for an aa meeting you can tolerate - they are quite varied.
Welcome back to sobriety /u/CatoAnderson.
Hello and welcome! Don't miss the Saturday Share stories in the sidebar and the link for the chat room. Glad you made it back.
Good luck life works better if I don't drink.
