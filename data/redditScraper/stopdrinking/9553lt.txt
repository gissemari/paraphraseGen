As said in the title my mindset is beginning to change. I've gone from thinking that creativity and personal development could be attained from being intoxicated to being able to see that it's not the truth. It's what's been holding me back. Spending a couple a days a week being intoxicated or hungover havn't ever done anything good for me as a person. ..I'm happy that I've quit and I feel like I'm able to do a lot more that I used to. ..I'm still struggling but I promised myself never to drink again and I think it's for the best. .

The lies our society tells about alcohol! No wonder it's hard to quit when everyone is brain washed into thinking that alcohol is the answer to adulthood...Stay strong!
You're absolutely right - you'll be able to achieve so much more sober. One of the things that still surprises me every day is how much time I have to do things. I'm way more present in my everyday interactions and way way way more productive at work. 
The only creative thing I did drunk was finding ways to drink more. I can't think of one single accomplishment I'm proud of that happened while drunk. 
The Artist's Way is a book that talks a lot about this. The author is an artist who also thought that booze was what fueled her creativity but she realized it dampened it. She wrote a book that fosters creativity and artistic growth through weekly activities and challenges rather than through alcohol or drugs.
