Here in Austin our whole city is in mourning as the festival continues. ..http://www.statesman.com/news/news/breaking-news/2-dead-after-car-crashes-into-sxsw-crowd/nfB5n/.. Just thought posting this-although terribly sad might be meaningful and helpful to someone struggling. .. Every year this festival brings tons of money and people to Austin. With it tons of free alcohol and a giant party. ..  Now that I don't drink my perspectives on the whole dynamic of the festival have changed. My thoughts are with the victims and families today. ..  If you think your drinking might put you at risk to harm yourself or others-you are probably right. DO whatever it takes to stop. You could save lives. .. Sorry if this is a bit erratic I am still a little in shock and hoping my friends I have yet to hear from are safe and sound. ...   .

Stories like this are one of the reasons why reflection is so important. Obviously this is the worst of the worst case scenarios but it's an important reminder of just how devastating alcohol can be if we let it...I think I can safely say the hearts of our entire community are with the victims and their families. I hope one day incidents like this will finally come to a stop.
Yep.  I'm always so troubled by these horrible stories.  These tragedies populate the local news websites everyday although the SXSW has drawn particular attention to this horrible thing.  The guy behind the wheel of this car was who I was always at risk of becoming when I actively drank.  
I'm a little uncomfortable associating problem drinkers with this. The guy is facing capital murder charges. It's sort of like if we posted something about a guy who shot his wife and children while drunk. I mean yes the alcohol was a factor but the man being a murderer was more of a factor.
