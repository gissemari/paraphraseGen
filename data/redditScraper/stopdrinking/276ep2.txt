Even a hill appears taller from the standpoint of a deep valley. This makes me think about a Machiavellian concept: that which is harder to obtain is harder to lose. I think that might be because when we work hard for something it's worth more to us.
Love this!  Worthwhile things are worth big efforts :). I tell my team "it's called 'Work' for a reason.  :)
I have a similar post that I plan to put up.  This is just so true.
