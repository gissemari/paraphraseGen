After relapsing into some old issues having a complete nervous breakdown and waking up god knows where after two days in a complete blur I'm going to stop. No drugs alchohol or anything. I have no idea how im going to do this after abusing my body daily for such a long time but thought I might hit you guys and ask for some tips or inspo

You got this...Btw you might want to get a medical screening ASAP as detoxing alone (depending on what your intake was) can be potentially fatal.
Welcome  . I wish you all the best. Just take one day at a time and let the past be the past. 
You're not alone.  I struggled by myself. I needed a new mode...I finally realized that it wasn't *lack of willpower* as my issue but rather *Lack of In Real Life Support*.  That's all I needed!..I went to meetings and immediately found people who understood what I was experiencing.  I got tools resources support and fellowship to first stop drinking and then to live sober...Now I just forgo ONE drink today - The First One..Never been happier!
