So I posted on here a few weeks back. I had been sober two weeks and then ran into my ex girlfriend. Hadn't seen her in 8 months and breakup was pretty ugly. Kind of messed with my head and relapsed back into heavy drinking. ..This past weekend I was on a pretty terrible bender. Day drinking on Saturday and I was being an ass to a friend. He hit me (I deserved it) and I fell and cracked my head open on the sidewalk. Came to in the hospital as someone is handing me a phone telling me it's my mom. ..The dissapointment in her voice broke my heart. "I don't see why it's fun for you to drink so much."..I wanted to scream at her.. "it's not fun. I don't do it because it's fun!" Which was a really sad realization on my part. I didn't tell her that because she worries about me enough already. I just told her I didn't know. Got a cat scan and a hefty hospital bill. ..And now I sit here with the usual post-bender depression. Except it's worse now and my head hurts. I'm not doing well and I need to get sober again. One of these times I'm not going to wake up.

I had a similar thing happen ended up having to have 3 teeth pulled and got a decent dental bill. It's not fun remember that. When you want to drink next time remember what will happen. I'm jealous of people who can drink in moderation need to come to the realization that I cannot. You need to come to a similar realization. 
Whew that sounds like a rough one. I've got an ex who just the thought of her makes me want to drink! Your mom probably doesn't understand but I sure do this shit ain't fun. And 15 days isn't nothing I hope you can build on that number next time! Take care of yourself my friend :)
