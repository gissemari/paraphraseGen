Like many people I miss Robin Williams but one thing I'm grateful for about him is his honesty when it came to his struggles with alcoholism...This [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLtPp_xIpC4) from his stand up bit kept me together early on in sobriety and helped me realize I wasn't alone in the struggle...If you're new to sobriety YOU ARE NOT ALONE. Stick with it. It's worth it and nobody gets sober on a winning streak. ..;)

I've struggled with my ups and downs over the past few years like a lot of us here.  Always remembering that I'm not alone and that there are many examples of famous people who also struggle with alcoholism is helpful.
Thanks for this one!
How do I add flair for number of days sober?
Thanks for this. I miss this guy so much. Do you know where to find any other clips where he talked about alcoholism? 
Thanks for the laugh! Some good clips to watch later too. 
I miss him
That was really fun to watch. I love when celebrities are open about their addiction and help shine a light onto it. I realize this is mainly a comedy bit but he speaks a lot of truths in it too. 
Excellent post. Thanks for sharing. 
Geez I miss him. He was a force of nature. 
Great clip and sooooo true thanks.  Will watch this more often as a reminder of why I should not drink. 
Oh thank you for posting that.  I watched the whole clip. Made me feel sad and hopeful.  
That's a great quote.
I'm about to fuck a Hobbit I gotta go good luck.
