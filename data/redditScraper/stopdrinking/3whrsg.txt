Suddenly things snap into focus...I've been pursuing unity all my life..But could only glimpse the monsterous vision in fragments;..It has haunted me for years...Each time I sighted it I struggled to make it concrete...At first it seemed I only had a sculpter's yard of unfinished figures - ..Then it slowly began to make sense ..Gathered from glimpses and inferences...More and more this mysterious life comes together...It may take years more to reveal the whole...That's all right...I'm prepared to go the distance...**My Take:**.There have been several times in my life mainly from a career point of view that I thought I was at the finish line. This was where I would stay until I retire.  But things keep changing.  I keep ending up back at the sculpter's yard looking at the unfinished figures. .It's happening again. .I mentioned a little while back that I was offered a promotion but I didn't want it and I was turning it down.  I got pushed in that direction again and I had to admit to myself that (dammit!) I'm the best qualified for the spot among my coworkers.  So I'm going to take it..Whatever happens I'm prepared at least today to go the distance **sober**.

Sober too I have found a purpose.  The essence of sober has within it a purpose.  ../u/Batman_2099 -- I don't doubt that you have a powerful purpose and this daily exercise keeps revealing aspects of your character.  Keep doing what you're doing.
