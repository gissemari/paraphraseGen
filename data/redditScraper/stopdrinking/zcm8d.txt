**1 Week Sober Yay!!!**...Background:.> I drank every day for about 7-8 years with very few exceptions.  I very very rarely went a single day without drinking.  I drank copious amounts of vodka every night until I was drunk.  As a functional alcoholic I told myself that it wasn't that big of a deal since I only typically drank in the evening.  I told myself that since I held down a job and wasn't drinking vodka for breakfast I was in control...> I made a serious effort at quitting about 3 1/2 years ago and actually went to my doctor about it.  He prescribed naltrexone and told me to stop drinking.  He also put me on some anxiety medicine.  I made it 2 whole weeks before I started drinking again when my willpower was no longer enough...> Last Tuesday 8/28/2012 I finished Allen Carr's booking on how to stop drinking and I've now been sober over 7 days.  I last had a drink on 8/27.  I haven't had any cravings.  This has been incredibly easy.  I have been starting new projects and finishing ones I had been putting off for years.  Feels Great!...**If you haven't quit yet or are really struggling with cravings please please please spend a few dollars and buy Allen Carr's book.  You won't regret it.  I WOULD scream it from the mountain tops if I could.  Life changer for me.**

Congrats! I have been having quite a few slips and relapses the past couple months and have had trouble staying sober. I am actually about to head to the bookstore. Carr's book on smoking was very helpful and feel the stop drinking book would give me some better insight. 
GOOD JOB!
