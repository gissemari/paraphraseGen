 So I just reached my eight month milestone.  That very same day I had to rush my mother to the hospital. The same hospital that I was admitted to exactly a year ago.  As I walked through the emergency area with her I actually recognized the nurses and one of the doctors that tended to me when I came in with a very high blood alcohol level. I looked at them and I wondered if they recognized me. I couldn't help but feel the shame and the guilt wash right over me all over again...I was praying that they didn't recognize me. All I kept thinking was  they're probably like oh there is that loser that came in drunk last year  ..It was about 4 AM when I was sitting next to my mom waiting to hear from the doctors about her CAT scan and I recognized a doctor that took care of me .... she was speaking to a man who was obviously intoxicated. She kept telling him that she really didn't know what more to do to help him. She kept saying  this is your third or fourth time here this month.  He just looked at her and said  I need help. ..Part of me wanted to go over there and angrily tell her  just help him he's begging you .  I felt his pain and I just wanted to reach out to him and say .... it's OK.    I stupidly I didn't do anything because I was just too embarrassed to be recognized as that  loser' who was in his position a year ago.    I froze.  I reflected.  ..I am very lucky to have pulled myself out of that dark place so that I can be here for my mother when she needs me.  ..I cannot emphasize enough how much the sacrifices I have made have been so worth it. So besides not jumping at the opportunity to help another because I feel like that's my duty I can at least say that I have come along way and every day just makes me stronger and maybe next time I will be able to offer somebody those comforting words that I wasn't able to provide. ..For those of you struggling I don't really have anything profound to say except you will never regret powering through the cravings and not drinking.   Emerging on the other side of those difficult moments is worth more than anything I can put into words. ..IWNDWYT

I recently sat in the ER overnight due to some health issues.  At about 3am when the place was finally quiet I listened to them talk to a young woman who had been in numerous times for alcohol related issues.  They quietly told her she was going to die within a year at the rate she was going. I just sat there and took it all in thinking but for the grace of god there go I.  I said a quiet prayer and just let them talk to her.  It was not my place to intervene but it rocked me a little that I couldn't speak up at 9+years sober...&amp;#x200B;
Such heartfelt true words that spoke to me. Thank you for sharing. IWNDWYT
