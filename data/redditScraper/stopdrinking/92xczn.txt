This update is mostly for myself but I get a lot of inspiration from other people's stories here so maybe this will help some of you as well...If make it through today it will be 10 weeks this time and I am pretty happy about that! I've been working with occasional struggles on getting sober since October when I had a seizure from alcohol withdrawal. I had a three month sober period after that and it was great for me my job and my relationship with my girlfriend. After that I had a few months where i would drink for a few days sober for a few weeks. Rinse and repeat. Everytime I would start drinking I could feel my anxiety and depression creeping back in. I know I can't drink anymore but it has been tough to keep away. Alcohol has always been there for me to help ease the pain and anxiety. I'm really motivated this time to keep things right. I'm seeing a counselor and that has been helpful. I'm learning I have a lot of issues that I have been pushing down all these years and the only way to move past them is to work through it and address them. It is part of who I am and that is that...The good: I'm happier and healthier than I have been in years. I've come a long way out of the depression I had after getting divorced and having to put my dog down due to old age not long after that. I still miss my old dog so much but the answers aren't in a bottle of vodka..I've regained interested in many old hobbies and activities. I'm hiking biking camping and swimming more than ever and I love it. I'm sitting here at the beach right now about to hop in for some surfing. Sober life is really good and fun..I'm also really hitting a good stride at work and I'm so much more efficient and effective these days. I like my job a lot but it is demanding every day and I can't drink and effectively do my job. Sober me is the best me...The bad: I still have a long way to go to fix the trust issues I created in my current relationship. I lied to her about my drinking and being an alcoholic. I have so many regrets. She is sticking by me so far but it has been a rollercoaster. I know she has contemplated breaking up with me and I don't blame her. I really love her and I hope we make it through this..I'm also struggling with telling friends about my problem. I have a hard time showing weakness and imperfections and I'm afraid people will act differently around me or not invite me to activities if they feel weird about it. I need to get over that and be honest with them...The rest: I've lost some weight but I could easily have dropped a lot more. I am eating everything in sight. Lots of sweets ice cream candy you name it...I love this sub and it has been very helpful to hear others challenges and success stories. I read your stories almost every day. You guys are so awesome and supportive. Thanks for turning me on to The Naked Mind also! Today I'm gonna surf and not drink so I can hit 10 weeks tomorrow! Best of luck everyone.
