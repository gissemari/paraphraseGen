I spoke with the President of our small 59 employee company after not getting very far with my direct supervisor.  We went through a downsizing and I absorbed a lot of responsibilities.  New management came on and they keep piling my plate not knowing how much additional work I've already taken on...I told him that I've been in a rut and that performing Accounts Payable duties has been making me miserable.  He was really very responsive.  He said to give him a couple days and not to jump off the roof in the meantime...It was terrifying but I think a very important step to my overall happiness.  I can't say that work stress hasn't been a factor in my continuing to drink after relapsing...I'm looking forward to being able to fill the majority of my day with Human Resource duties again.  I have a therapy appointment for March 2nd...I will not drink today!

Good job :) 
He sounds like a good leader.  Keep up the great work!
Huge step actually! Good on you!
Nice work! So good to see the stuff that you feel capable of tackling even three days in. Congrats too on your three days. The first days were the hardest for me so good work sticking it out.
