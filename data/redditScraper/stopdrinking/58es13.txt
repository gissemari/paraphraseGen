Hey everyone! Here's Thursdays quote :) I hope you all have an excellent Thursday!    ..Theme : self love   .Quote :  Why should we worry about what others think of us do we have more confidence in their opinions than we do our own? .  Brigham Young   ..This is definitely something I've struggled with and I know others struggle with as well. My instinct has always been to conceal the problem  and fix it before anyone notices. This is alright for dealing with a small problem at work but is terrible for the heavier things. Why are we so intent on shouldering all the weight.   ..But when it comes to concealing a drinking problem this is not only a terrible idea it's catastrophic to you and it's pointless as well. Ask yourself what you are so afraid of in telling people you've quit drinking. Afraid of the looks? They gave you similar looks while wasted if only you remembered. The jokes? Are they any worse than your most shameful night being rehashed? The prying questions? They pry regardless.   ..Every day  between the clothes you wear things you say and do  all dictate the message they untimely perceive and make judgements on. So why not give them something positive?   ..Be well everyone ..Not Today

That just makes too much sense yet the question in the quote is challenging and therefore intriguing...It was easy for me to get past what others that I did not respect thought of me. It's the ones I did/do respect that's a little tougher. One of the ways we humans keep from going insane is by reflecting ourselves off of others and seeing what comes back. This is why enough isolation can drive you crazy and why too much of it is unhealthy...I can say that I am a lot more confident in my opinions than I used to be yet I sometimes wish I was a sure about one thing in life as some others seem to be about everything...Do I sometimes then care what others think? Well yes and I don't think that is entirely unhealthy at all. Am I so obsessed with what others think that I will let them set my agenda? Hell no. You know that saying: *If you don't set your own agenda someone will step in and set it for you.*..Today I try to carry myself in a way that even my worst enemy wouldn't have anything bad to truthfully say about me. That's my ideal. I miss the mark from time to time of course but I never give up trying...And while I'm big on self-sufficiency initiative and creative problem solving if I get stuck on something for too long I no longer feel any shame in reaching out to a trusted advisor or friend for input. Remember what they say about advice though: Make sure it's good! I don't have all the answers or ideas but I mostly know a good one when I see it. :)
The bible says no man lives to hiself and no man dies to hiself. To me that means I wasnt born to be alone with only myself to answer to. The beauty of living to me is being part of the human race . That means peoples ideas choices happiness  sadness and journeys touch lifes. So my life may touch others lives and I want that to be a good thing. Which means yes my life isnt my own its the people who I touch lives as well. And vise versa with others lifes touching mine.  And when I die those that remain here I hope remember me as a person that cared what I was to them. That being part of my ambition to get sober. I want to be my best and free to share my life without shame.
