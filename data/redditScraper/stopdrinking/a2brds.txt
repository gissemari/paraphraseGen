I know it's a bad substitute but i feel better and I feel that it'll be easier to drop the caffeine the only habit I've struggled with is drinking. Cigarettes easy peasy Cocaine? Not a problem. But beer? So hard. But I can do it!

best of luck. 
Right? I've had no problems with those things either including weed but beer man.  Keep it up but yea the Red Bull is bad.  I have a friend who for a time just kept drinking those and he passed out while helping someone move.  Maybe it could have been related to something else too I'm not sure but yea it might be better to try coffee.  
You can do it! I believe in you. IWNDWYT 
Well done but be careful caffeine addiction can be a serious monster to get over if you end up over doing it...IWNDWYT
