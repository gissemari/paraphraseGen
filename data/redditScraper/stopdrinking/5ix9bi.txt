I stopped last Sunday after my drinking ended my first real long term relationship. She has moved on quite easily and is going to a party tonight.  My anxiety has been full tilt all day. I slept off most of today but I'm awake now and scared. Oh I still live with her because if I go anywhere else is my friends couch and that is binge drinking central. Tonight is definitely the most I've felt a craving for liquor in an extremely long time. I keep staring at the clock saying another 5 minutes  another 5 minutes. I'm struggling. Games aren't distracting me enough and her getting dolled up right in front of me is the worst of all. I'm struggling here I just need to vent a bit
