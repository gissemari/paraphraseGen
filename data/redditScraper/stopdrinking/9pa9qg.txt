I made a conscious decision January 11th of this year to get sober. I had that small window of willingness open up and I took it. Went to a meeting everyday for about 70 days kept 70 days of sobriety. Then a relapse. Then 30 more days...then relapse. 30 more...relapse. 20-relapse another 20 relapse so on and so forth until this past September I was barely able to get to around 4 days and I was drinking exactly how I was before I decided to get sober. I returned to the hell that I had built once before...Today I am on day 4. The first 2 days I had flu like symptoms and I have not been able to stop eating.  So I've been eating a lot of fresh vegetables and lentils as well as all the candy and chips I want...and water lots of water. ..Day 4 and I am finally feeling better again in fact I woke up this morning with a ton of energy and feeling very happy. The thing is I know that 'happy' feeling is a product of my body re-calibrating it's a heavy swing up and if I've learned anything from relapses there's heavy swings back down. ..I can get those 30 days and things get great and I feel ok and that existential dread creeps in and I say fuck it and boom. Relapse carousel. ..I'm ready to ride the rollercoster tho and take it to new levels cause being stuck on the go around feels like a very haunted place to be. I start an IOP Monday. I've been at 2 meetings a day since Sunday. IWDWYT
