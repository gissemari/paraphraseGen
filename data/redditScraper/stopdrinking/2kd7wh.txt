And YOU get a cake and YOU get a cake and EVERYBODY GETS A CAKE!../SD and the people who contribute here are the reason I've made it to 90 days. I joined /sd two years ago and have struggled so much but here I am. ..The day is beautiful. I've got fabulous plans. I thought my life was good but it's getting so much better. My friendships are stronger and more real. I'm killing it at work. My family life is improving in ways I was afraid to hope for...Thank you thank you thank you. I will not drink today...Have a great Sunday everyone. And there's plenty of cake so feel free to come back for more!
