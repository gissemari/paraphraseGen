First major event today since I got sober. I knew it was coming really struggling with aniexty today. I know I can't control anything but me any encouraging words would help. Though it's easier to move this time since I'm sober And less chaotic due to knowing where my stuff is I'm still having a hard time. I will  not drink with you today.

I moved house while drunk so many times and it was invariably panicked stressful and haphazard.... I thought at the time the drink was helping but in hindsight it really wasn't!!..Play the tape forward and think how much worse it could be if you were *impaired* by being drunk or hungover......Best of luck with it all - let us know how it goes?..It's difficult and stressful yes but sooner or later it will be over and you can heave a sigh of relief... sober!..I won't drink with you today... Happy New Home!..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Moving sucks but it's worse hungover!  Good luck IWNDWYT!
You've got this. I bet this evening you'll reflect on it as having been the easiest moving day ever.
Hug! .Moving is yuck but at least your sober!  I usually just do my best stick to my timeframe and smile and be nice to everyone helping even though inside I'm simmering or crying!  It only lasts a day.  Then you get to unpack!      I will not drink with you today even though moving day is not our favourite thing!
