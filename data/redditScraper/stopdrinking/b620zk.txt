So unfortunately I am not new to addictions. I'm 31 now and my biggest addictions have been gambling and marijuana. I've had an on and off battle with them for nearly 10 years now. Pretty much daily smoking and whenever I had money to gamble. It's been 12 days since I've firmly devoted myself to never ever go back down that road again as I just have no self control. Now my other issue - I have been trying to stay busy and keep myself focused on other healthier habits (as recommended) but at the end of the day my ass just does not want to stay sober. I also have pretty bad depression and have been using weed to cope but now when it's late at night and I'm alone with very negative thoughts I just want to escape. I've never been a big drinker a few shots of tequila and I'm already doing the gag reflex and feeling like I'm close to my limit. However this past week I've been drinking every night (sometimes morning) and I've been able to take more and more shots (close to 10-11 shots a night now) and I can tell my tolerance is building up rapidly (exact same thing happened with weed). Not just that I'm buying a pack of cigarettes almost every day. Before this I usually smoked 1 cigarette a day so I never went through more than 2 packs a month...&amp;#x200B;..Obviously I have some deeper underlying issues that is making me constantly search for some kind of substance to drown myself in but more than that my question is how do you guys get out of that constant struggle with not wanting to be sober? I can't figure out if it's because I hate myself that much or if it's that feeling of escaping reality but I honestly can't remember the last time I was happy being completely sober. Typing this as I'm pouring myself another shot.. ..&amp;#x200B;..Thanks for reading and to anyone trying to stay clean best of luck

I just got sick of the pain I was actually causing myself with booze and not being able to live any sort of life while still active. Just. Could. Not. I sat on my couch (wasted) and would envision all these things I was going to do. Yeah right. When? Once I sobered up the next day?? Never happened. Couldn't happen until I put down that shit. It takes a lot of work (for me) to want to stay sober. I get the case of the "f\*\*k it's" a LOT!  But one sober foot in front of the other and better things start to happen. It just beats the alternative for me. I'm not always happy but don't recall a whole lot of happiness being "sh\*t-faced either once it all got out of control. Keep checking in on here! IWNDWYT
