I'm new here and just wanted to jump in and share. Like some others I've never been a blackout drunk but for about ten years now I've really struggled. I drank every single day at least half a bottle of wine when I was alone (on good nights) much more when I was with other people. The heavy social drinking is normal among my group of friends and I loved the subtle feminist victory (or so I thought) of keeping up with the guys. I had no idea whether everyone else was drinking alone too but at first I did it because I was bored and it made me feel like I had an edge that other people didn't.  Oh you don't drink alone? How sweet.  But over the years it just felt sadder and sadder as I found myself slave to the grocery store. Soon my pre-6pm life became all about reworking my schedule to make sure I had time and money to buy wine on the way home and my post-6pm life became all about netflix and obsessing over whether or not I'm drinking too much how to make my half bottle last until bedtime and whether I can make it to the grocery store tomorrow to buy more because OOPS I went slightly over half a bottle EVERY. SINGLE. NIGHT. and if I've done that I may as well have another glass. What a fun edge to have!  ...Recently though I've begun to feel like too much of me is dead inside because of this. The countless wasted nights in front of the TV weigh heavily on me. There has always been this war between daytime ambitious me and nighttime fuckup me and lately I feel like the latter has been winning as those habits become more and more automatic (even when I desperately didn't want to drink or felt I didn't crave it I couldn't stop myself which confused/scared me the most) and during the day I feel irritable and depressed and my brain feels vibrating with dullness. I've lost my spark of interest in the world which used to be the core of my identity and I'm terrified that this insane drinking do-nothing couch potato will become my identity. I've been doing this for too long and I'm desperate for a change.  ...Anyway I've tried quitting plenty of times before but it has never lasted more than a few weeks. Right now I'm haunted by this question taunting me throughout my day: What makes you think this time will be different?  ...I'm sure this question has been asked before probably recently but it's good to be reminded. Do you have this nagging voice telling you you'll fail like before? How do you deal with it?  ...For me it's different because I've admitted to other people (albeit strangers on the internet) that I have a problem and I'm trying to change. I have an accountability I've never had before. I've also never admitted that I'm an addict to myself before now so I'm also more actively and consciously seeking out information about my addiction and putting measure in place to make success easier for me--nighttime distractions reading This Naked Mind (to start) listening to other peoples stories and basically anything else I can do to get out of my own head and stop getting wrapped up in my own pity party. I'm not really qualified to say this yet but this sub is already helping so much. My two days have been hard so far but turning to this sub and reading everyone's posts during my lowest points has gotten me through. *Thank you!*

We're glad you are here and thank you for showing the courage to share this all it helps me to read that what I go through others do as well.... which is what has helped me the most that my situation isn't all that unique and the shame I felt for so long was just in my head for the most part...The first few days I had to keep putting myself in check specifically patience in my recovery. Drinking for 18 years abusing my body for 18 years... I had to slow my mind down and realize that all that abuse wouldn't be fixed in a few days.
Glad you are here;  That nagging voice you mentioned that is literally not your own free brain. That is the voice of alcohol speaking to you through your neurons because it has already re-wired your brain.  Hence why the substance is addictive. It alters behaviour and brain neurons to make you consume more of it.  Once you just stop and realize that you can stop and that you true inner voice and brain is hidden underneath this other voice of alcohol manifesting itself as fear of failure you'll be amazed at what's truly underneath!     ..I can't wait to hear how you feel then!  I"m very excited for you.

I wish I could be this articulate. All the best. 
Glad you're here!!..I finally realized that it wasn't *lack of willpower* as my issue but rather *Lack of In Real Life Support*.  That's all I needed!..I went to meetings and immediately found people who understood what I was experiencing.  I got tools resources support and fellowship to first stop drinking and then to live sober...Now I just forgo ONE drink today - The First One..Never been happier!
