When I reconnected with my soon to be wife in 2009 I was 32 days sober. It was a Flaming Lips concert where I was working and she was in attendance with some mutual friends. We had know each other for roughly 4 years before through these mutual friends. It also happened to be a time when both of us were single....Fast forward to 2013 2 kids later and 3.5 years of drinking. Now I'm in active recovery. I have home group and a sponsor. My sponsor and I sat down recently and did my 4th and 5th Steps. Which was quite the experience. I ultimately saw that there was nothing to be scared of and was as open and honest for the first time in probably 12-13 years. I'm sure that I should be happy and grateful to be alive in my kid's lives and with some one that loves me... And I am grateful....But I'm also really really scared right now. I'm getting ready to get into the most committed thing I've done in my entire life. I feel my character defects right there with me. Hell I'm still learning how to process feelings and emotions. I'm practicing asking for removal of my defects and shortcomings. I just man don't even know what to tell you I'm feeling....Sorry if this seems incomplete but I just don't even know. Thanks for being here.
