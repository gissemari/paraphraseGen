And struggling...I made it 6 months sober before and just couldn't take it anymore then I was drunk for the better part of a year and admitted I can't moderate...So 5 months ago I called it quits permanently.  First 4 months went swimmingly then about 3 weeks ago the urge to drink flaired up badly and has gone away every now and then but has mostly stayed...I've also gained 5 pounds during my sobriety previously losing 40 in the year spent drunk...I know in a cerebral sense sobriety is the right choice and drinking won't fix anything but I really need a night where I don't just worry all night long and I don't know anything else that brings me peace like alcohol does...I have a therapist she's taught me how to meditate but that's had dimishing returns lately...Maybe this is just a time when people get itchy and I just need to push through...Either way I won't drink with you today..

I told a friend of mine I was struggling with some anxiety recently and she said "What a great opportunity to nurture yourself"!  I don't know why but that has sort of stuck with me and now i am discovering how I am able to find some of those nurturing moments in seemingly arbitrary every day decisions. "I'll have a giant salad".  "I'll wear my favorite outfit". "I will sit on this park bench for 10 minutes". "I'll take a hot shower for however long i want". It sounds silly but when i take note of those little opportunities to be kind to myself I tend to act on them more and they add up and help move me into a place where I don't feel like I am leaking anxiety everywhere. I'm sorry you're struggling. 5 months is so great. I don't know a whole lot about economics but drinking also seems like an exercise in diminished returns whereas there is a whole lot of data that backs up sobriety as being the sound investment. Rooting for you. I will not drink with you tonight.
