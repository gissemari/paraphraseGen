Not sorry alcohol that I kicked you to the curb! I am 40 days sober today!! Looking forward to my 400th day! Has not been easy and the cravings still come and go but I will not give in ever! You can sit and laugh all you want alcohol because you think I will come running back to you but it is never going to happen. Since I kicked alcohol to the curb I sleep longer and more sound I have lost 17 pounds my skin looks better lab work is better off a blood pressure med and bp is 104/70 I follow through with things I start more energy and way more money! It is a win win! Anyone who thinks they can not do it you can. I never thought I could as I drank every evening.  This is the first time I have even tried to quit in over a decade. If you are struggling hang in there because it is beyond worth it. IWNDWYT

Congratulations on the journey! Best decision I ever made for me and my family.
You grow with the vine you climb.
Congrats! Wow 17 pounds! I have got to get on the stick lol. My discipline has been waning. I do feel better though and I'm about to call the doc about my bp. My diastolic number has been pretty low at 63. I'm not really sure what is too low. It is so worth it!
Really good results in  such a short time. Congratulations!
Right on! Well done
Those are some really impressive results. Congratulations!
Right on! FU alcohol. You are a liar and a thief and no longer a part of my life...Iwndwyt
You are right! You CAN do this. So much hard work is behind you already and although there is still hard work always ahead you have demonstrated that you can do this. What a great list of positive outcomes already. Keep adding to it; with each passing day I am sure you will. Congratulations on 40 days.
