I'm ~7 months sober after 12 years functionally drunk and on the cusp of falling down. I suffer from major depressive disorder and abuse alcohol to cope. Doesn't sound like it works...and it doesn't but my system became a comfortable way to slowly burn my life to the ground...This week and today in particular I'm in absolute freefall WRT sobriety. ..I've got a good network of friends counselors and such but am losing internal battles and struggling for my life. Today I went to 1 on 1 counseling and met with my doctor. They're both well aware of the dangers I pose to myself. Meeting with them is the easy part...the other 22 hours of the day I'm stuck with me and the insatiable desire to drown my emotions in alcohol. I can't drink. I know it. And that's why I'm here. ..Tonight I don't want to drink. I'm going to do my best to not let myself down.  Everything about this process is hard and I realize that my problem has multiple facets that don't belong in this sub. I really need a little support to stay sober today if you guys have any words of encouragement. Thanks!
