I have been feeling down lately and decided to post.  The replies I received made me feel so much better.  Sometimes I will read a post and think I should reply to that but I'm kind of busy someone else will.  ..I'm going to try to not do that anymore...Strangers on the internet are literally the reason I haven't relapsed in the past few days.

Keep going strong you're doing good.  I'm only 1 day into sobriety and I feel the pressure of it weighing down on me immensely...I hope that I can reach how far you've made it.  I hope that with this community that is possible.
Reaching out here in a meaningful way helped me take my first step. After a thousand tries at day 1 I've finally looking at the final hour of day 12. 
It's not just for that reason I also believe by helping others it helps your own sobriety. 
Glad you are feeling a bit better! :) 2 days to go to the big hunndddoooo..High Five
Absolutely the effect that internet strangers can have is amazing. The kindness of strangers on this sub is a  big reason I'm still sober. 
You guys give me hope I can do it.  The longest I've made it so far is about three weeks.  With no holidays or celebrations coming up in the near future I feel like this is my time to beat this silly addiction..
I love the "Posts in need of attention" link in the sidebar.  I know I don't have time to reply to everyone but I check that once a day and make sure some posts get at least one reply  before I go to bed.
