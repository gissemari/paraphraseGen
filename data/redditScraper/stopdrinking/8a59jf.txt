A struggle I've had with AA was feeling out of place in meetings because of the age difference. I'm hoping this will help.

I went to one when I was 40 because my sponsor was younger and looked 12. It's very chill and full of a lot of support the group I went to had fellowship afterward at a funky middle eastern place with no liquor license LOL!
My experience was great!! I go three times a week now bc I get to see my friends and talk honestly and openly about my emotions and sobriety. Go and meet people after. Get their numbers and call them. I almost drank today bc of stress but I called another girl from aa and she talked me out of it and was just a really good friend.
