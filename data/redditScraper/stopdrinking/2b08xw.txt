[MRW I woke up and found my badge smiling 365 days!](http://i.imgur.com/0XmMiIo.gif)..Life is such a beautiful ride when you're in the driver's seat instead of letting booze take the wheel. For anyone out there struggling tonight I want you to know that this **tough work** you're doing for yourself to get healthy is so much better than going on autopilot with substances and letting things just *happen around you*. Be present. Be mindful. Allow yourself to feel things that upset you anger you or maybe even give you anxiety... and then let it pass. Deep breaths. You are never alone. I'm so proud of you all! ...Much love..Pseu
