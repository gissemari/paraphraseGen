Not today...With the world being what it is among other stressors in my life I've been edging closer and closer to relapse.  I've also been away from this sub for too long.  Thank you for existing.  Ten minutes on here and my desire to pick up a bottle of booze turns into a desire to commit myself to self care.  Thank you. You guys are awesome and a huge part of the reason I continue to choose sobriety over intoxication.

Welcome back :) 
pretty much anytime i am feeling bad i realize i am neglecting myself and need to get back on track. not today indeed. 
Sometimes I had to say "Not now" and repeat again several minutes later.
It's admirable that you are self aware about getting closer to relapsing. Welcome back :)
Not today
Not today. 
Your self-awareness is serving you well!..I know that neglecting to look after myself properly leads me back towards thoughts of drinking. This sub helps keep those thoughts at bay for me too...I will not drink with you today.
What do we say to the god of booze?.."How bout some seltzer?"
I've taken up reading again since I quit drinking I recently started A Storm of Swords :) actually about to grab a cup of coffee and read a few chapters this beautiful Saturday morning!
Not...fricking...today Satan...My phone autocorrected fricking to drinking so I'll take that as a message from reverse Satan.
Not today! Also i'd cut back on the Pandas too while you're at it ;)
I say "Fuck you booze! I'm growing again today!" 
FUCK THE ZERO
