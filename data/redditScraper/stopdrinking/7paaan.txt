It's day 10. First off I didn't think I would make it this far if you had asked me even a month ago. ...Also I struggled for a good while with RESISTING the temptation. ...Then realized I am now a NON-drinker. That's that. I find other ways to fill my time and:...I sleep through the night!..My face looks younger and brighter..I have lost 6 pounds ..I'm not hungover every damn day ...The list goes on. Thank you all!

congratulations and courage to you on your journey ahead.
Keep at it hot on your tail here working on day 8. The benefits are clear. The long game is daunting. One step at a time!
Day 9 here for me! And I found a surprising satisfying drink of my own concoction (or at least I like to think of it as mine). Tonic water with a bit of grenadine and some lime. Looks like an alcoholic drink. Feels like an alcoholic drink and most of all too bitter to gobble so I can nurse it for the social settings I endured since going sober without pressures or questions. 
Thanks!
Right on! I make Mocktails like:...Glass of ice .Mostly topo Chico and a couple ounces of kombucha. ...
