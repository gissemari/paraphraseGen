Work is the most stressful part of my life. The reason I have my alarm on the app set at 5pm to remind myself how long I've been sober and how much I've saved. The minute I walk out that door I head straight for the liquor store. Every. Single. Day. But not today. I will not drink with you all today.

Today is only my second day in and I fully expect my ritual of getting off of work and heading to the LQ to hit me once i get off. But if I've learned anything in this sub is it is way easier to do nothing about your drinking than going into the store. Like you literally just have to sit and sitting is the easiest thing to do. ..I will not be drinking with you today or tonight
I did the exact same thing. At my quitting time my phone would give me a message that said "go home". Don't go out of your way to pick up 650ml 10% IPA's to drink while you take the long way home. 
Yea!..Evenings right after work were my weak moments.  I had a similar pattern.  Arrive home?  Time for a little glass of wine!..I broke that pattern by finding a meeting that started at 5:30 pm.  That got me started on the right foot each evening until I had a new habit.
Have you tried the gym? ..Punch things lift things grunt sweat get exhausted.  It's hard to want a drink after a good workout. :)
Great idea with the alarm.  I think I'll do the same.  After work is defiantly the challenge
Getting off work was usually my drinking time (if I didn't have one or two before or at lunch). I would stop at the first gas station I passed on my way out and get a pint or a 5th and crack it before I hit the next stop light. I won't drink with you today! Stay strong 
Yup - still haven't found that replacement activity for the end of my workday.  But I know I will need to before long if I'm going to keep this up.
