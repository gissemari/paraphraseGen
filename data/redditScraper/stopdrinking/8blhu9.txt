Y'all I came here for support because while I have actually used my fear of failure (I don't want to wreck my streak) to not even desire anything I am celebrating an anniversary (10 yrs w hubs) tonight and we close on our house Friday. I am struggling so much. I am clinging to my phone literally to keep my hands busy on this sub so I won't take a drink. ..And here's the honest truth - my hubs walks in the door from work just now with the good bourbon and vodka and he didn't acknowledge today. I am mad and hurt and I want a drink. ..Help

I drink so much damn whiskey its rediculous. Used to be id never be able to drink half a bottle in a night. 
IWNDWYT ..The craving will pass. 
I think of it this way. If you do drink you will still wake up mad and hurt and feeling like shit. It sounds like a really sucky situation to be in. Not sure if you can go for a walk to clear your head or tell the hubby that you know you can't drink and see where it goes from there. Wish I could give you a better answer to help you get through this.
50 days is amazing please don't ruin it. Numbers like yours motivate me. I'm so tired of my resets don't be like me. IWNDWYT 
Lol thank you for this! I needed a laugh! Chips and guacamole here I come!
Good idea. Weather is nice. I'll go outside calm down and regroup. Thanks for the support!
It's a day for celebrating on your terms. Do what will make you happy in the long term. 
A lot of good advice and encouragement here. I always enjoyed this saying: no one ever wakes up sober feeling good and says they wished they had gotten drunk the night before..IWNDWYT.
