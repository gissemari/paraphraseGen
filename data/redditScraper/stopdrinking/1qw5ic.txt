I had a bad relapse after my boyfriend cheating on my emotionally (texts read his journal with him writing down her responses to his questions etc.)  Then an abortion.  And working on two hours sleep without alcohol really working until 3 then up at 4:22 with the kids then up at 6 for back to work in the kitchen.   So all spiraled out of control on Thursday and led me back to the worst of the worst.  I felt like everyone around me my boyfriend (who texted my ex to say my kids were not safe then they had a coffee the next morning).  Everything was misinterpreted.  I was so sad this weekend.  But today I am pulling forward.  Today I realized that I am still the sunshine lovely woman that I have always been. I just have to fight if off and have.  I am so sorry to those that I have hurt especially myself.

6 days means something. Alcoholics like me can never be the people we're capable of being until we wrest ourselves from our addiction. Once sober we are free.
Although it can be hard to accept is it possible that your current relationship is more a source of stress than support? If there are children involved you need to make decisions that take them into account. I'm not judging at all I just hope that you can see your way through this. Sometimes sobriety requires a change of circumstance. Just a thought. Wishing you the best.
Amen to dayatthebeach. Sounds like you had a horrific couple of days. Good luck.
