It's a big night for drinking and there will be a lot of new people visiting SD over the next week I imagine...I've had a big two years of healing and self-care and this year I'm going to make a special effort to welcome new subscribers with kindness and to focus on humility and compassion. ..I want to remember that while it might feel good to not be hungover and ashamed shouting about it might not be helpful to those struggling and hoping for understanding...(Please don't think I'm directing this to anyone here it's genuinely for my own accountability I can be quite the smug git at times and I think the further I get from my drinking days the easier it is to forget how scary and difficult my first days and weeks actually were).
