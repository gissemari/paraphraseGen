Good morning/ afternoon.   .theme: get determined.   .**"Most obstacles melt away when we make up our minds to walk boldly through them.- unknown**    .What I get from it: staying sober became a lot easier once I gog off the fince and decided I would get sober no matter what.  It stall had its struggles but it gave me something positive to focus on.

Most obstacles aren't obstacles but we sure are.
I'm only on day two but I like this and find it relatable.  Moderating never worked for me.  Somehow it's less panic inducing to simply realize I don't drink anymore.
