Don't drink. It won't be tomorrow think about how much time you may need to achieve 7 days again. I thought it will only be a day and 2 years passed.
Thank you friend 
Just hit your pillow tonight without getting drunk first. If you could do it yesterday you can do it today! 
Thank you! 
Hey there SpecialK have you heard my newest sober jam? ..**if you chase sobriety as hard as you chased booze you're golden**..    if you need some courage you can have some of mine.  If you need some strength I'll give you that too!  And I'm throwing in a bear hug!  I will not drink with you tonight 
Thank you!! I went back and forth so many times in my head last night but I decided NOT to give in. If I do this time I certainly will again. I'm feeling way to good physically and mentally to break the streak!
