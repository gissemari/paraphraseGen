Last night I had my first night of sleep in I have no idea how long where I took nothing. No melatonin no weed and no booze. It felt great and honestly I feel really rested. I'm still struggling with cravings but *insert picture of the hulk* I see this as an absolute win.

Awesome!  I'm happy you were able to get some quality sleep without the need for anything to help you sleep.  ..&amp;#x200B;..You can read this article [here](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/how-alcohol-affects-quality-and-quantity-sleep) from the National Sleep Foundation on how alcohol negatively impacts your sleep.  It's interesting stuff!  Knowledge is power IMO...&amp;#x200B;..IWNDWYT!
Anyone have tips on sleeping?..I often wake up in the middle of the night and cannot fall back asleep. Struggling with how it solve this. Any suggestions are appreciated.
Oh man.  When I think of drinking again the one thing that stops me without fail is the thought of loosing this amazing sober sleep.  I love sober sleep.  LLLOOOOVVVEEE IT.  Cravings pass.  Hit up This Naked Mind if you can.  That can knock a lot of them out.
I started drinking because of a huge problem with insomnia. Once I discovered a glass of wine or two could send me off to sleep i started having that whenever I had a big day coming up. Over a few years that turned to every night and the amount increased. I also tried out sleeping pills... i got addicted to them so quickly within weeks. I found that addiction to be much more intense than addiction to drinking. I actually had really bad physical withdrawal symptoms when i stopped ... if anyone is thinking of taking them please be very careful. They also caused severe depression for the duration i was taking them. I also took mirtazapine for a couple of years which helped me sleep but made me put on weight and feel lazy. ..For a few months last year and a couple months this year i have been sleeping completely unaided by anything. The first time i was so scared it felt so strange. Just me alone in the bed trying to do this thing which apparently everyone else does naturally and effortlessly. But i have got so much better. Sleep hygiene does help massively even though i dismissed it before. It also made me realise that anything that helps you sleep usually also impacts your quality of sleep so in the end it's usually not worth it. Only took me 8 years to figure out! ..Best of luck to you and hope you come to enjoy your natural sleep too.
