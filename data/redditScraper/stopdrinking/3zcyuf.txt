I posted here a bit under my old account but lost the password.  Long story short I had to leave my home with nothing about 4 months ago.  I have slept on the streets stayed with my little brother(alchoholic) my parents(heavy drinkers) and now my older brother in a hotel.  He promised me a sober place.  I have had 1 relapse in the last 4 months(last week). I am doing pretty well I think but I am really at a breaking point...He is now drunk and starting arguments with his gf.  I have no where else to go I am miserable because I am 800 miles from my kids I don't know what to do.  This was my last idea.  I have a job and I am trying to save money for my own place I went to a meeting today to come home to this. I am sitting here in the bathroom crying and fighting the urge to go grab the bottle.  I am just so tired of trying so hard and just things getting worse. I don't know why I wrote this and sorry if it doesn't make sense.

I don't have any advice but if it helps I am thinking of you and wish you only the best and brightest future.
I'm sorry you're having such a hard time. Have you thought about a sober living house!  I stayed in a half way house and several friends stayed in an Oxford house. 
Is there an AA group that is open between meetings? I used to hang out there when things were too chaotic at home. It was the one place I knew I'd be 100% safe from drinking.
