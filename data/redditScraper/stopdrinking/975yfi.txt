Just had some awesome pillow talk with my lovely wife. Nothing crazy or super interesting but I could tell by the way she animatedly told me about her day that she was genuinely excited that I was present and engaged rather than passed out and drooling down my face. ..Honestly that one reason is good enough for me. For 12 years she has been my rock. And me not drinking makes her life infinitely better. That's good enough for me. ..Side bonus: I jumped back on the wagon quickly enough this time that I'm not suffering from withdrawals. That's good. Not relapsing again? That'd be even better. ..Goodnight Neverland! ..Jack

That's a great reason not to drink. My own sobriety is the best way and the foundation to make up for my past bad behaviour. Well done on getting through day 3. Hopefully I see reason 4 tomorrow!  
Being really present in life is the best part of being sober! I had no idea how detached I was because I was pretty much always either drinking or hungover...Congratulations on day 3! 
I remember in early sobriety i would go to bed early just to keep from craving alcohol. I would read and more often than not my wife and i would have really good conversations. I often found myself looking forward to going to bed. It was relaxing calm and comfortable. I sort of found myself wondering why I hated going to bed before. Its great being able to find joy in new things.
