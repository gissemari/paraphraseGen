I know this sounds like hyperbole but it's true...I figured I would just give a brief update incase anyone was in the position that I was in when I first stopped drinking...After quitting on January 1st I wasn't prepared for how difficult things were going to be.  My anxiety spiraled out of control and I felt that quitting drinking had actually amplified my suffering.  I was truly struggling with staying sober and struggling to even function...Essentially I had lost the ability to self-medicate my life-long anxiety...Quitting drinking ultimately gave me the courage (and forced my hand) to seek help for my anxiety which in turn lead me to starting to take (a pediatric dose) of Zoloft in conjunction with talk-therapy...My entire life has changed.  I've travelled all over the world and all over the United States alone and with friends.  I've been through birthdays work-parties multiple weddings sporting events all sober and still enjoyed myself!  I've developed stronger and more authentic relationships and for the first time I feel like I can make slow and intentional decisions about my life.  ..I honestly can't even really remember what it feels like to be drunk/hungover...I could write a book but I won't bore you guys I just wanted to stop in to say thanks.  I don't post here much but I probably wouldn't have made it this far without this place...At first it didn't seem worth it but I'm grateful every day that I don't drink anymore and I'm so glad I've made it this far it has truly been the most transformative thing that I have done for myself.
