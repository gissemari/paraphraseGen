Hello. A kind redditor pointed out that I relapsed yesterday when I wasn't even aware of it. Out of the shock and found this community today. I've been lurking. I work from home and put in a solid four hours. I promise. I don't have the guts to share my story maybe one day. Thank you for sharing your relapse stories...I'm sorry but I can't drink with you today. House sitting for my parents while they're on holiday. I decided to organize my childhood home. My dad is neat (one who washes hands changes clothes etc) and has silently put up with my mum's chaos for decades. He is also a collector of random things. The 80s are a blink away and my siblings and I have already talked about their future. My old man has already brought up he and my mum plan to downgrade soon...I started with drawers. First their bathroom. Oh man. My mum has expired stuff from years ago tucked in the back! I've also cleared out some in the kitchen as well as one of my mum's work spaces. Hello cough drops expired in 2012. Do my parents really need six peelers? Seven bottles of rubbing alcohol. Handfuls of paper clips in three different rooms. Does my dad really need twelve combs? He decided to go bald this year...I'm going to go through photos tonight. Dad has been an amateur photographer since he was a kid. I remember back when scanners first came out he bought one and wanted my siblings and I to scan all the albums. We never did. I'm going to put a pause on my mum's stuff and start scanning his albums. There is at least a hundred if not more. If I have time I'm going to figure out how to digitize his old slides too. Maybe going back in time will remind me how lucky I am and how thankful I should be. He took so many photographs I still dislike having my picture taken to this day. I only call home on birthdays Christmas Mother's Day and Father's Day. It'll be a good wake up call. We'll see how far I get. 80 years of stuff is a lot to go through alone.

Hey what a wonderful mission you've put yourself on!    I'm happy too just thinking about his face when he sees what you've done!  And your joy looking through all those slides and photos!   &lt;*sigh*&gt;
