Been thinking about my recent relapse after 400 days of relative sobriety.  My relapse started on Friday Dec 15th after a particularly hard week.  Sitting at a restaurant bar eating dinner before going to see Star Wars with my wife and kids. It happened so quick.  My wife ordered a drink and I just thought why not I deserve this - I work so hard on multiple fronts.  I can have ONE DRINK! So I ordered a martini up!  I remember that excitement that rush as I took that first sip.  I mean I don't want to sound too dramatic but it was dramatic.  Boy it tasted so good and I felt great.  Fast forward to December 25th.  I was right back in the saddle.  Pre gaming with vodka hits before family events looking forward to that first cocktail of the evening and dreading any event that may disrupt my fun... I ended up endangering my family with my dd and got into a physical altercation with my son after he cussed out my wife.  The incident with my son is more complicated because he needs me to be a good father and that means holding him accountable - but it cannot ever be physical.  I need to be stronger...  As I have been reflecting after getting back on the wagon on the 26th I like parts of drinking - social excitement rush laughing the buzz relaxation camaraderie etc. but I hate the risk of poor choices the hangover loss of control lack of responsibility the way my kids look at me when I have a drink in my hand etc.  For me drinking It is analogous to living on a rollercoaster.  I simply cannot do it.

I'm glad you're back. Thank you for your accountability. It's posts like these that help me maintain my sobriety. Those 400+ days are not lost - let's do this!
It sounds like it still feels like forbidden fruit still a sweet treat. Does that have anything to do with a general sense of your life as "duty" or labor? If so and the drink represents a missing sparkle treat how could you introduce an "element of sparkle" in another truer way?..Do you have any creative hobbies that make you feel free and alive? What brings you joy? What feels awesome? (Hiking into the wilderness and discovering natural hot springs and soaking under the open sky? Taking photos of phosphorescence in the nightwarm sea?)
