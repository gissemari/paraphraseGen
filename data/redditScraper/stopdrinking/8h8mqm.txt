I won't give in to the stress anxiety depression loneliness and fear. ..I will not drink to make myself feel better. ..I will not drink to fix my problems. ..I will not drink so that I can actually get some sleep. ..I will not drink to punish myself for things I've done and things that I couldn't control. ..I will not buy into the thinking that I'm worthless and damaged. That no one will ever love me and all this baggage so I should just drink myself into oblivion and slowly fade away from reality. ..I will sit here safely locked in my apartment un-showered still in pjs watching Return of the Jedi and scrolling this sub. ..I will tell friends and family that I need some support today. ..I will tell my mom that I had struggled to care about myself and my existence for quite some time. ..I will cry a lot. ..I'll embrace the struggle of acknowledging I needed massive change in my life and that it's not easy to do. ..I will embrace the process of change.

Awesome.
Well done. Youre really staying with your emotions rather than numbing them with alcohol. You can do this.
