Greetings Posse Members..As I've mentioned the relapse voice has been whispering in my ear for the past week. Just now I was relaxed / safe enough to be able to step back and observe the voice a little bit and play the tape forward. Here's what I found...For now the voice is saying something like  just once just let loose and have a ripping good time then I'll leave you alone.  Now I already know this is a lie. I know that giving in to the voice guarantees the exact opposite: that it *will* come at me again. What I didn't know is what it would say next...So I  played the tape forward' and I realized that... no matter how the actual experience of drinking goes whether it's enjoyable or it's disappointing or it's shame-inducing the voice **will** say to try it again..Either:.1.   That wasn't as much fun as we thought it would be - better try again.  Or:.2.   That was so awesome!! Are you kidding?? We **have** to do it again!!  Or:.3.  Wow. So. You really are just a fuck-up after all. You know I knew it all along. Might as well drink then. At least that way you get to feel better for a little while every day even if it means feeling like a worthless piece of shit the rest of the time. ..Whoa! That voice is not on my side. Not on my team. Not an ally. And the thing is that 1 and 2 both lead to 3 don't they. If you're here perhaps you know what I'm talking about...Thank you so much everybody who's been helping me out on here including the person who recommended the Rachel Hart podcast which helped me see this. IWNDWYT Friends.

Such an evil voice.  I've noticed that it withers and dies after awhile without attention.
That voice is really bothering me today. Saying exactly what you just said  just one more time  it's a lie.
Yes I know exactly what you're talking about.  Thanks for mentioning that podcast.. I am going to listen to it.
Great post. Been hearing that evil bitch myself that last day or so. I pick door #4... IWNDWYT.
Good job! It's great to be mindful of The Voice. It will get quieter with time. Another strategy I use when tempted is to remind myself that all of those precious neurotransmitters I've been building back up will be  washed away  if I decided to drink. There is no amount of pleasure or fun I would receive from a few hours of drinking that would be worth that. 
The voices you hear are The Hungry Ghosts!...I've been listening Tara Brach's [Healing addiction- De-conditioning the hungry ghosts](https://www.tarabrach.com/healing-addiction/).and it helped me a lot....I wish there was a way to evict the stupid voices from our brains. 
Thank god that voice ends up getting weaker the longer we go without feeding it the booze it's after.. if it ever dares talk to me these days I say...  really?!  You must be joking.   .Powerful stuff you just did there!.Stay strong friend! .IWNDWYT 
Nailed it; I'm obviously not alone here. Thank you. IWNDWYT.
also you're guaranteed to feel so conflicted/nervous/confused during this "one ripping good time."  it's not like you're going to pop open beer #3 and not have a care in the world.  the whole time it's gonna be like "wtffff am I doinnggg how how far is this going to go how am I going to feel tomorrow??"           I'm not the hugest Annie Grace fan but the parts in This Naked Mind about "cognitive dissonance" really stuck with me.  I know that would be a huge issue should I ever start drinking again.
Totally know what you mean - still figuring out how to quiet what I call "the noise" - also known as that voice or in my case what seems like the band of devils sitting on top of the hog-tied angel who is attempting to help...Good thing you got a posse...IWNDWYT.
