I never remember it being so challenging around this time of year but then again I was still drinking all other holidays so.....I don't know. It's just difficult. I was sick almost all of November and it showed on my paychecks. I'm struggling to keep up with bills as they fall more behind with threats of repossessing my car and my heat getting shut off. I'm trying to stay positive  but my birthday is on Christmas and my mom's was too. She passed away almost 11 years ago but it's still really difficult. As well as not being around my dad which I always have been except for this year and last year...It's hard for me to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I have a supportive partner who is very loving and understanding but I have to realize that I have to do things for myself. Which I have been but he has been helping me out and it's very nice. He's a good guy. ..Things are mostly ok I'm just struggling on finances and holding off on making amends. I made one last night to an older gentleman who said I had no reason to make the amend because he couldn't recall me being inappropriate (although I know I have been before hence the reason I made it. It felt somewhat better but maybe a little confusing. I guess I'll just have to pray about it and for the willingness to do more....I know I'm kind of scattered I apologize. That's all that's going on just felt the need to get it out. Thanks for letting me share..(edit: spelling)

You mentioned you're making amends I am assuming therefore you're in AA and working the steps? A home group and sponsor really helped me through these tough times.
Dear /u/ch42 ..We are always here to listen! Don't forget that you have a sober group of people that are here to help when you feel like you can't help yourself. As VE explained already I know that when I feel like everything is falling apart around me I make it to my homegroup. My sponsor tells me when I'm in my own head and feeling like nothing is going right and that I'm the worst person in the world to help another alcoholic. I do that here and by service work in AA. I hope everything starts to feel better now and that you are able to get through this. Don't forget about us here!
