Hi everyone!..We had a blizzard last night? At least that's what they were calling it I guess on account of the high winds. It snowed and I'm sure the roads are a mess but....I've seen worse. As far as blizzards go I'm just not that impressed. I'm grateful that I can take public transit instead of driving today but that's about it. ..I've started reading a book called  The Five Things We Cannot Change' by David Richo. He's a psychotherapist though the book is more spiritual/philosophical in content than anything else. ..The basic premise of the book is that there are five  givens  that are a universal part of life and that it is our fear and denial of these givens that causes us problems. (It sounds vaguely Buddhist because it is.  I rely most heavily on the Buddhist tradition because that spiritual tradition emphasizes the importance of seeing through our illusions and facing up to life's givens in order to become who we are more fully meant to be. )..You call that a blizzard?..Hi everyone!..We had a blizzard last night? At least that's what they were calling it I guess on account of the high winds. It snowed but not an excessive amount although it was raining before and I'm sure the roads are a mess. I'm grateful that I can take public transit instead of driving today but that's about it. ..I've started reading a book called  The Five Things We Cannot Change' by David Richo. He's a psychotherapist though the book is more spiritual/philosophical in content than anything else. ..The basic premise of the book is that there are five  givens  that are a universal part of life and that it is our fear and denial of these givens that causes us problems. (It sounds vaguely Buddhist because it is.  I rely most heavily on the Buddhist tradition because that spiritual tradition emphasizes the importance of seeing through our illusions and facing up to life's givens in order to become who we are more fully meant to be. )..These are the five givens of life that Richo identifies:..1. Everything changes and ends. ..2. Things do not always go according to plan...3. Life is not always fair. ..4. Pain is part of life. ..5. People are not loving and loyal all the time...I wrote a couple of days ago about the relationship between gratitude and acceptance. The combination was identified in my daily reading in  The Language Of Letting Go' as being extremely powerful but without a comment on the relationship between the two. ..I've been looking at what I have in my life to be grateful for (my resources/assets) and what I need to accept (as a way of identifying what I *don't* need to accept which are things that I can change.) It's been a somewhat useful exercise - I certainly have both more to be grateful for and more that I can change than I previously realized. ..But there is a direct relationship between the two that Richo identities which I missed.  When we accept the good with the bad the easy with the difficult gratitude arises automatically.  Gratitude is the *result* of acceptance. So gratitude and acceptance are a powerful combination because having both demonstrates a deep level of acceptance of ourselves and life as it is. And that in itself is powerful...One of the great challenges to acceptance that he identifies is control.  Control is one of our favorite ways of running from life as it is.  All worries are really worries of not being in control. And we don't ever have control no matter how much we struggle against the givens of life. We only have a belief in our ability to control. So it is letting go of that belief and accepting the givens of life which allow us to let go of worry...Anyway though it's a clearly written and easy to understand book it's very dense. There's a lot of ideas in there. It is very helpful to me for where I'm at and it feels very much like the right book at the right time. I'm much better at understanding things on a conceptual level than I am at putting them into practice but I suppose the practice of these things is really the work of a lifetime. I'll let y'all know how my enlightenment gets along as I move forward...I find the idea of accepting myself and life as it is in this instant very powerful right now. It's not a new concept but somehow it just feels more real and more powerful. I guess I can see ways that I've been fighting reality that have been causing me grief. And one of those ways is of course substance abuse. Intoxication was a way for me to run away from reality at least momentarily. ..I heard an old chestnut of an acronym at a meeting last night that's quite appropriate: **S**on **O**f a **B**itch **E**verything's **R**eal. I'm working on Step Two at the moment ( Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity. ) Sanity I am starting to see is acceptance of reality as it is. My denials and distortions and fantasies are the insanity. Sanity is seeing that everything's real how it is...And reality as it is has opportunities for growth and development and joy that my controlling fantasies don't allow for. Acceptance of life as it is also connects me to others because I am part of the human experience. ..It felt good to get back to a meeting after being sick over the weekend. I am grateful for my sobriety because it too connects me to others and offers me the opportunity for growth and development as a person...I hope that you all are well thanks for sticking this one out I know it got a little long winded. It's a lot to chew over that book. ..Ginger_Sprout Out

Great post!..Love the 5 bullets...I'd amend #4 -.."Pain is part of life; Suffering is optional"...Great sequence you've got 123...Next one is just a short 4 digit strobogrammatic homogenous palindrome away -   1111 + 123 = 1234 !..Celebrate those sequences!
Fantastic post. Stsy safe out there in the "blizzard" IWNDWYT
Thank you Ginger Sprout for another enlightening post.  I've been involved with a yoga meditation circle for the last 3 months.  Studying the Yoga Sutra's by Patanjali.  These concepts of spirituality have really illuminated my mind.  It's a long trip but I think I'm on the right path.  We survived the  blizzard  out here in the burbs too.  Take care and keep doing those good things you do.
I really really love this. I have been diving back into meditating since I quit drinking and I'm telling you it has made allllllll the difference. I had dabbled in it before I quit but never regularly. Now I do it just about every night before I go to sleep. I have actually now started to catch myself mid-berate. This is astounding to me. My awareness is growing and that only helps with this journey of staying sober. I wish more people weren't so afraid of it. It's really just stopping and focusing on your breath. It activates the parasympathetic (calming side) nervous system. It's effing science yet people think it's "religious." At any rate your post is very helpful and I will look up this book. :)
Hey ginger:  today I made that turmeric lemonade with coconut milk instead of water:
