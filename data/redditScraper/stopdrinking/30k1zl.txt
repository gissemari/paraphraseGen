Happy friday folks...Just popping in to say that I feel absolutely awful right now. I came down with a cold about a week ago which morphed into a sinus infection. So I've been feeling pretty awful. To being this awful cold the girl I was seeing split up with me. I shouldnt be that broken up about it but my one outlet for pent up energy is lifting. And being sick all week has kept me sidelined from the one thing I look forward to...So why does it feel like a relapse? I just got done from a short shift at work and took a physical inventory of myself. Chills shakes poor appetite low energy and focus even some anxiety and a bit of depression creeping back in...It feels pretty awful. But I started on antibiotics and hope it passes soon. I havent really had any cravings for a drink really... if anything its been cravings to get back to the gym and get my mojo back. I can be sick miss workouts each junk food but nothing will cause me to backtrack more on my progress then to pick up a drink...Thank you all! Have a wonderful weekend!..Edit: Couped up going to watch MSU win tonight hopefully sip on some seltzer water and munch on stuff I shouldnt be eating.

A sinus infection is a bummer. No wonder you feel yucky. I've been there and empathize. Kudos for 386 days! Easy does it.
