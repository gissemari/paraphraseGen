Hello all just wanted to drop a quick line as I celebrate 30 days without a drink.  Things are going really well.  I'm not sure what the difference is between this time and other attempts to quit since my relapse but I'm not going to look a gift horse in the mouth.  I'm feeling really strong going to meetings weekly and calling others whenever I have any problems...This shit is working and I'm very happy about it.

Great news.  I bet you're not trying to "quit forever?"  
Right on! You sound like you're rocking it this stormy Tuesday! (Well it's stormy where I am.) High five!
This shit IS working! I like the way you put it :D
just want to say well done! I am also moving towards the 30 day mark and like you not sure why this time is different but very glad it is!
