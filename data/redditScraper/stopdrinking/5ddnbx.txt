Just finished my thesis and final exam for my engineering degree and have completed all my coursework for good. ..What better time to get out if this cycle than now. Spent all of today in bed feeling pretty sick. Anyone else here struggling with early days?
----------immediate responses--------

The early days were really tough for me.  Especially the first one.  I remember feeling terrible and regretful that I had relapsed once again.  What got me through the first couple of days was calling up and reconnecting with my family.  I found a lot more power in telling them what I was trying to do than telling my peers.
Congrats on completing it!..I struggled so much early on - withdrawals for a few days I was exhausted and rested lots. My urges remained strong for some time after that though they did start to reduce in frequency and intensity and I became better at dismissing the alcohol salesperson voice in my mind. ..One of the things that I've found most rewarding developed over  months - finding out how I like to live sober I got more active.  Alcohol is no longer my reward and coping mechanism.
Great job on finishing the thesis exam and coursework!..In my experience I was in detox in the hospital during the first week so I had constant oversight by doctors medical staff and was prescribed medications and vitamins to assist with the process. So although I felt very sick I think it could have been worse had I not gone to detox (it should be noted that I experienced severe auditory hallucinations and went through a very difficult WD period)...In any case I found that lots of water/tea sleep rest healthy diet and vitamins helped me along very nicely. ..I'm glad you're in a much better place. Please keep us posted!
