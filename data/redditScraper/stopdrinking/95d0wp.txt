Hi there folks!..So i'm 17 days sober today. I start to feel my body responding. Triapid helps me with the cravings and antabuse makes me be afraid of alcohol...My medicine what i take for PTSD Borderline and Bipolar works better. I feel like all my medicine works better. ..I have way way less anxiety. My cravings can be really bad but even if i'd say: "Hey one beer only" i can't because probably antabuse would kill me. But triapid helps me fucking much about this...So i have less anxiety i can sleep better and even my medicine works better. I saved a lot of money. There is no reason to be non sober. There is no way i will say: "Hey only a few beers" after 6 months of soberity. This time i will say hey fuck beer! Give me some soda and an antabuse. ..Antabuse is a really cruel medicine. It works by fear. When i was on my first rehab there was something called "Blasting" or "Exploding" and you had to take antabuse (here it's called antaethyl) for three weeks and they made you drink a glass of wine. A dude almost died he was transferred to the ICU and i vomited for hours (i needed infusions) i had the worst headache possible i had a blood pressure of 220/150 mmhg and a fever of 41c  (105.8  fahrenheit). And it was from about 1 deciliter (3.3 fl.oz) of cheap wine. Since that this practice has been banned by the medical chamber for obvious moral reasons...But antabuse works and if you really really have the motivation but you are afraid that you might relapse antabuse is your medicine (EXCEPT if you are suicidal). It really worked for me before and i was sober for 300 days with it. It's agony what it makes. I wanted to die when i drank on it. But death doesn't come easy. It's horrible. It's true agony...Wish me luck I won't drink with you tonight!..-/u/Hunthrowaway  ..
