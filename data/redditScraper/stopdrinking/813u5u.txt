It's been over a month without drinking and it's been the best decision I've made in years. Although I'm still struggling with depression right now its a genuine comfort to only deal with one problem at a time instead of a constant (self-created) tornado. ..I'm having a hard time tonight but I know it would have been worse while I was drinking and smoking weed every day. In the last year I messed up a lot of work opportunities because of drinking and know that tomorrow I'll be on point even if I'm a little tired. In the past I'd be next to useless struggling to stay awake and battling nausea while pretending to work or doing the absolute minimum. Not anymore. ..This site has been a massive inspiration to keep going and I love you all for that. I'm starting to feel like myself again. Thank you so much.
