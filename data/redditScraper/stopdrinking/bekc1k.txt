Hello family I am almost at 5 months sober. My life is so much better today. I still struggle with acting out sexually for attention binge eating laziness selfishness getting caught in my self will. I haven't been working a program daily for a few weeks now. I have amazing people all around me but I know this won't happen by osmosis. I was on step 8 then moved cities and I've had every excuse possible. Everyone talks about so much freedom from completing the 12 steps and actively doing a tenth step every night and having a DAILY REPRIEVE. I have not been living the spiritual life it has been more of a theory for me for a while now. Trying to light that fire under my ass but I know all to well we can't think our way into acting. We must ACT our way into right thinking!!!!! I think I'm nervous to finish because I don't feel ready to sponsor other women I'm like I still struggle with bills don't drive or have a car am   so behind  when truly I know I'm where I'm supposed to be and I'm going to get out of recovery what I put in... I'm exhausted with this avatar I'm living in and I read this quote about depression being when our soul is ready for so much more but we are limiting ourselves in the present because of the pain or shame of the past fear of the future etc... most days I feel like I'm just running from limb to limb barely making it wearing all these masks and being a scatter brained people pleasing fool!..Anything helps :) yes I'm in therapy :)

I wouldn't be in a hurry to sponsor others. Being part of the community for awhile until you have over a year and can honestly say you have/are working and living the steps is kind of crucial to having an honest relationship with people you sponsor. ..I only struggled with steps 4 and 5. The rest pretty much came naturally. Just do your best if you can. I went back through them two more times before I had 5 years. ..Not everyone is cut out to be a sponsor. There are other service opportunities if you feel the calling to volunteer. ..Good luck. IWNDWYT
