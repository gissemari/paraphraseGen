Hi.  So I'm struggling a bit these days and I'm not sure why.  For the first time since I quit I feel that a relapse is possible.  I'm not thinking about drinking I'm not planning on drinking but for some reason the last few days I've felt like it's not 100% out of the realm of possibility that I might drink again some day and that scares me...I detect a general pattern in my life right now that kind of fits with this.  I feel unsatisfied on some deep level.  I'm happily married two beautiful kids decent job and income but I feel like despite all this (or maybe because of it) I want something to happen.  I want to move forward in some meaningful way.  Instead I find I'm backsliding.  I've been doing really well for the past few months losing weight but Halloween was a fucking disaster for me and I put a few more pounds back on.  I've been arguing a lot with my wife over stupid shit.  Getting up in the morning and facing another day of doing a bunch of crap I don't want to do instead of things I do want to do is depressing me.  And on top of it all I have this insanely stupid idea that it would be okay for me to drink again eventually someday...I'm posting this partly because I could use a few sage words of advice and perspective and partly because I think there is a mistaken impression amongst many members of this subreddit that sobriety is in the bag once past a certain point.  Just because someone has sober days in the hundreds doesn't mean shit.  Don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it too whether you have 1 day or 10000 days...Anybody got some smarts they can share with me?..***.**Edit**:  I really appreciate everyone's responses.  I find that posting this here had the effect I thought it would. It started the process of breaking me out of this funk.  I had a really open conversation with my wife after I posted and I told her how I was feeling.  She was great in her response.  I deeply appreciate your kind words of support.

Get to a meeting. Call an alcoholic and talk. Sit with the yuck and find out what's underneath. Anger? .Happy? Alcoholic? ..Passes - all you have to to is not pick up. ..(edit cake was burning) I realize this reads as really a bit preachy my apologies. ..I've no grand wisdom for you or even anything you don't really know for yourself...For me the 'just for today' works. I can do anything I like tomorrow .The halloween issue doesnt hit in Australia the way I understand it does north...But is that the only trigger for you at the minute?..
When I get feeling overwhelmed and the thoughts start popping into my head that I can drink my problems away I try and find a quiet spot and think carefully what my life will look like if I did drink today.  I'd lose my friends my family my job my car my health and finally my life.  I'm not sure how long it would take but I would...Something else I've been finding that really helps me feel better is talking to other alcoholics.  Meetings have been really great lately...As my sponsor says "You can be the best you can be by just not drinking today"..Take it easy AF and if things get really rough you can always grab some Maple Syrup eh! :)
What can you do today that's going to get you from what you're doing to what you want to be doing? Got an idea? Cool.  Now do 'em like the goddamn badass that you are!..Go for a run. Make a healthy meal. Apologize to the wife.  Spend time with the family and reflect on how blessed you are to have these people in your life when not too long ago it was in jeopardy. ..As for drinking someday in the future...well who knows? You're afforded today and today only. Make the best of it. And that starts with not picking up a bottle of poison. ..P.S. love you man. 
According to RES I've upvoted you 12 times.  I'm pretty sure all of those times were you giving me encouragement so seriously - thank you for that.  I've saved a notepad file on my computer of quotes from this subreddit that have really helped me.  Some of them must have been from you but I didn't attach the usernames to it which I regret now.  Really all I have to offer you is this file (I'm struggling these days too) so here it is despite its lack of proper citation:..1. There's an old Chinese proverb that says: 'If we continue in this direction it is likely we'll end up where we're headed.'..2. One of the reasons I've always been so good at getting away with things is that I've always obeyed the golden rule of the amateur con-artist: know when it's time to stop. Recognize when you really have reached your last chance; and don't push it an inch further....3. It's interesting how as alocholics (if you are one) we come in consumed with fear of things that can't hurt us that are imaginary- fear of people AA the world around us. Yet we're not afraid of things that can kill us like drugs and drinking ourselves to death...4. "There are certainly high bottom and low bottom drunks but an alcoholic is the only person with a terminal disease who will attempt to distinguish between varying degrees of an illness that is DEADLY."..5.  The realisation that's got me through the BBQ and the office party and the birthday gatherings was that the thing I'm so tempted by I already had and I rejected it. If someone takes a recreational drug and mid-high says fuck this I don't want it... That's a pretty crappy drug. Of all the opinions I can trust I trust my own the most. I was there doing the thing I apparently want to do and I said to myself this isnt worth it I want to quit. So actually when my resolve is wavering I don't want what drinking really is in reality I'm wanting the fantasy of drink I've created in my own mind. I want the exaggerated memories where I was enjoying myself that I can somehow attribute to the drink and strip it of all its repercussions...6. That cycle: drink -&gt; get drunk -&gt; hungover at work -&gt; hellish day -&gt; I deserve a drink tonight -&gt; repeat.The stupidity of cycle is so painfully obvious in sober hindsight...
Hey buddy!..What have you done for your sobriety today? Maybe it's time to start getting balls deep into some program of recovery. You sound very isolated. Spending too much time in my head is dangerous it's a ghetto up there...Weight loss is a process. I aim for general health. A few pounds is not the end of the world but a few drinks might be. Halloween was not a fucking disaster. You didn't drink. You did what lots of people do: eat candy. ..Another thing...why not make exercise a fun and social thing? What do you like doing? Any great Canadian sports? 
Hey A_F I'm always around if you need someone to talk to. I guess you're doing the right thing now just trying to make sense of what you're going through and talking about it. 
Go out and help another alcoholic? It's pretty much the best solution anyone has against drinking and feeling that way and I don't mean online. 
I could share some platitudes (don't drink no matter what this feeling will pass help others with their problems to get out of your own practice gratitude) but I don't think you're as close as you think you are. There's always a nonzero chance that any of us will drink again but we do what we can to keep that at bay. Asking for help is a powerful lesson in remaining teachable and whether that lesson arrives when you ask for it or twenty years down the road or even not at all I increasingly believe the act of asking is the most important part. For that I really appreciate this post and what it means to my own sobriety going forward. We do what we can and try our best to accept the outcomes. You do awesome work here and if the "early returns" on this post are any indicator your fan club (us) is all in your corner on this one. We're all in this together but just for today you got this...TL;DR [don't blow your nose in your shirt](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/zujs8/sober_me_vs_drunk_me_a_story_of_causality/) :).
It would be the easiest thing in the world to pick up a drink. I would barely have to seek it out I could just wait for someone to offer one to me. This is the thing that keeps me slightly scared and a little humble and alert. It would be the easiest thing in the world and I choose not to do it. I make that choice every day for that day. Giving up drink and living sober has changed everything in my life for the better. I still get that stupid voice in my head every now and then saying "why not have a drink?" I have one answer: "not today."..I would love for it not to be an issue anymore. I'd love for drink to just not be on the table. I would also love a unicorn filled with puppies and candy. Ain't happenin'. ..The past is unchangeable the future is unwritten you only have a say in the present. Don't drink today and you keep control of the present. That's  all you get that's all you ever get but it is enough. ..Good luck to you. 
Sounds like you're in a temporary funk and don't have something enjoyable to look forward to on a daily basis.  You're focusing on the negative rather then the positive.  Been there many times...Some of the various actions I've taken to get out of it.....Get a sitter for the kids and go out on a date with your wife.  Eat out at a restaurant and go see a movie or get some X-mas shopping done.  Open up to her about how you're feeling currently and make amends for bring short and sharp with her.  She deserves to know what's going on with you and after spending this much time with you she can handle it...Write it down and share it with a trusted adviser.  Not unlike steps (4&amp;5 and/or step 10 in AA)...Find some new recovery literature to read that can build back up your enthusiasm.  http://www.amazon.com/Dr-Bob-Good-Oldtimers-Recollections/dp/0916856070 and http://www.amazon.com/Pass-It-On-Message-Reached/dp/0916856127/ref=pd_sim_b_2 fired me up and has kept me trudging along this service path I've been on over the last 10 years...Take some time out just for you.  Whether it's a computer/video game or a weekly night out with the guys/friends.  You need to have some balance... a method for you to cut loose and enjoy yourself without the spousal/family stresses/responsibilities even if it's just for an hour or few...Obviously the AA meeting is a quick attitude fix.  But if I remember correctly the whole higher bit you hear frequently in AA drives you a bit batty...It's good you brought up your recent troubles.  You're right it is important to share when we're struggling a bit especially after we've been around awhile as it helps to keep us all vigilant.
Just because someone has sober days in the thousands doesn't mean shit. All we got is today. We are not invincible. It sounds like you know how vulnerable you are which I believe is a good thing. You gotta take action. You know this stuff. Talk to your sponsor go to a meeting. Don't drink today. I know that feeling you mentioned about having a stupid idea of it being okay to drink again because I've shared it before with you all. We're sick people. But we can recover/get through it by talking with another alcoholic. 
Already a lot of responses here. Two things came to mind for me reading this post though. ..1) I've also found myself slipping into the mindset of "well maybe someday..." lately. I haven't confronted it head-on but instead thought things like "just stay sober until this crazy idea of drinking again fades". ..Then I found myself rereading my old posts and going...

You know? It's like you hear that old song on the radio and suddenly you're 16 again. Maybe I don't know. I hope you figure it out.
Oh man I've been there man. Around 6 months ago I had my first scare in almost 2 years. I had the perfect combination of feelings that made me not want to feel anymore at almost any cost. ..I called a couple people in recovery that I am close with. I kept calling and talking about it. I looked to help another alcoholic. I reminded myself that this feeling would pass and that the only thing that could make it worse was a drink...Thank you for posting this and just don't drink today.
Hi A_F. By the number of comments you've gotten already you should first know what a beloved guy you are around here. That should help some...I get into this sort of funk from time to time myself. I've noticed that it's cyclical and in my case I've tied it to inevitable exhaustion that comes from carrying a life-size cut-out of John Wayne with me every where I go...Like all alcoholics I suffer from pretty serious problems with self-esteem. My reaction to those feelings is to try and be not equal to but better than. I work more try to please more try to handle more try to smile more. Eventually the gap between my real self and what I'd have others believe is real starts to grow and the strain of holding up the illusion rests on me. I've spent so much time trying to meet all the obligations I've assigned myself that I've thought of everyone's well-being but my own...My advice is to spend a little time taking care of your shit instead of someone else's. Find a task on your to-do list that's not really necessary and that no one else even cares about and blow it off. Let yourself off the hook for a while. There was a time when all you needed to do to call a day a success was go to bed without having had a drink. Start holding yourself to that standard for a while again. Take a breather. We'll hold up the world for a while until you're more rested.
I'm no professional but in one sentence you say ..&gt;  I'm happily married two beautiful kids decent job and income..A few later you say..&gt; I've been arguing a lot with my wife over stupid shit. Getting up in the morning and facing another day of doing a bunch of crap I don't want to do instead of things I do want to do..Perhaps there is a disconnect between what you THINK and what you FEEL. 
I find that getting used to being uncomfortable is a HUGE part of long-term sobriety. If you are a 12-step person it's six and seven work. Sometimes you just have to hang out in your character defect and get used to not acting on the impulse of escaping your feelings of boredom or restlessness. It's the only way to grown into self-acceptance regarding the Halloween clusterfuck and life in general.
I appreciate the fact that you are here.  Up until now I viewed you as some sort of demigod of /r/stopdrinking.  Sage of sobriety champion of cheerfulness witness of wisdom.  And in truth you are many of those things.  But it is important to remember that at some level we are all on the same page regardless of our days spent sober and that is the level of the mortal alcoholic.  No one is perfect and that is good.  Could you imagine how much unwanted attention people would be throwing at you if you were perfect?..I wish I had better advice for you in return for all of the beautiful gems of knowledge you have had for me and the others here but what I have will modestly suffice (I think.)  It seems to me that you are losing your contentment and there is really no reason for this.  Contentment comes from within.  Or at least if you go chasing after and base your contentment upon external achievements and objects or future goals you will never find your contentment...There are two ways to practice contentment.  The first is through gratitude.  When your emotions run amok and all you can think about is what you are missing practicing gratitude is a good place to start.  There are *so* many things to be thankful for.  You have a wife and beautiful children a house and a nice job.  There's that.  You probably have some comfortable furniture a television a vehicle or two and a washing machine for your clothes.  You might even have the capacity to buy and cook warm delicious meals offer ample clothing to your wife and kids have access to education etc. etc.  There is basically no end to the people places things or ideas that you can be thankful for.  I personally *really* appreciate the excess amount of clean drinking water I have access to.  "Practicing gratitude protects us from our own pettiness and smallness and keeps us centered in the joy and abundance of our own life."  My youngest brother used to tell everyone that our family was rich.  We were not rich with money but with love...The second way to practice contentment is through "the paradox of non-seeking."  The harder you look for contentment the harder it is to find.  First "discontentment is the illusion that there can be something else in the moment."  You go out to dinner with your family at a nice restaurant.  They forget one of your drinks the meal comes late your steak isn't cooked the way you asked for it and the waiter was rude.  It takes some skill and patience but it is important to note that *that was the moment.*  Things unfolded the way that they did and if you try to change that you are going to become discontent.  If you base your contentment on some distant idea that everything is going to work out perfectly down to the teeny-tiny essentially random details you're going to have a bad time.  One of the major premises of contentment is that there is nothing missing from what you have.  It's the idea that life is complete the way that it reveals itself to you in each moment.  When you compare your life to others you see all of the things that *they* have and *you* don't.  So by not searching for contentment but rather by looking at what you have in a pure and neutral way you can find contentment with what you have.  Even being content with your discontentment is a thing you could practice...I'm sorry if it seems a little jumbled but I think it might help you a little.  Practicing contentment by displaying gratitude and being healthily happy with your position in life is never a bad idea.  Remember that the time is *now* and you are *here* and that will always be the case.  You will be just fine.  Sit and organize your thoughts and answers will come to you...Stay cheerful.
A safety net to prevent relapse is an important component of recovery. It requires introspection honesty and time but the results are worth the effort. ..I have upvoted you 14 times so you obviously have a solid foundation and insight about recovery. But as you said it doesn't make us immune from relapse. ..I commend you for this post. Relapse starts before we actually pick up a drink. Your post sets an excellent example to the point that none of us are exempt from the "cunning baffling powerful" pull of our addiction. I can attest to that myself. ..I'd be curious about your thoughts if you are inclined to review the link below. ..* [**Relapse Prevention Plan**](http://www.addictionsandrecovery.org/relapse-prevention.htm)
The one line of advice that I keep coming back to time and time again:.."The part of you that is telling you to drink again is the same part of you that is willing to drink yourself to death"...It's up to you to decide which part of you that you want to listen to.
When these times come along and they do for almost of all of its important to throw yourself into whatever program (AA for myself anyway) you have for dealing with your alcoholism from the start. I stay happy and sober today the same way I did in the beginning of my journey by going to meetings making phone calls meditating and trying to be of service. Many times I know my higher power saved my ass because I don't know how i made it through some of my own crazy thinking without picking up a drink or a drug. I will keep you in my thoughts my friend. You will make it through!!!
Sorry I am late to the party but I wanted to say thank you for writing this! I was struggling recently and was afraid to write about it because I was worried that I should have "gotten it" by now. But thank you for showing me that recovery is worth more than pride!
