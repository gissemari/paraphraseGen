I haven't had a severe craving for alcohol in almost 4 months. ..So this entire week I was traveling for work and had a 5 hour drive home. The traffic was terrible and the weather had been nasty all day long including terrible drivers. I only had about 3 hours of sleep so I was irritable as ever...Suddenly while I was driving I had a sudden urge to pull into the gas station and buy beer. I have not had any cravings up until this moment and it was an absolute nightmare...The craving was paralyzing. I was terrified and crying because I forgot what it felt like to actually want alcohol. I felt completely helpless...To be completely honest out of all the years I drank heavily I have never had a craving that intense in my entire life...I'm proud to say I conquered it and feel much better today...IWNDWYT

Well done. Glad you weathered the storm. Tiredness can be a trigger. IWNDWYT  
Awesome. Similar experience here today. High fives all around    
Those ambush cravings can be so shockingly powerful - so awesome you came through the otherside! 
Thank you! I'm having the Friday struggles and this was perfect to read. I will make that trip straight home to my girls and will begin a sober weekend with them..IWNDWYT!
Maybe that was your addiction trying to talk you into drinking...You starved it. Good job.
So awesome!! You did something that was hard that in the moment was difficult to do. I find the more times I do something I should do especially when it is not something that is particularly pleasant (or comfortable at the time) I come out the other side feeling so powerful! I've experienced this effect with working out meditation cleaning and many other things in life!..I'm looking forward to kicking that next cravings ass! Thanks for this post! Great job!..IWNDWYT.
