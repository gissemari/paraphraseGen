Well you definitely are not CURRENTLY drinking yourself into total oblivion so that's absolutely awesome.  I can't really chime in on this because the longest stretch I've had booze-free was 37 days and I drank at the end of this.  I'm sure you'll get plenty of useful answers. ..I will say this- there are a lot of other things that you desire to do that you prevent yourself from doing.  If you can stop those desires then I'd imagine you can stop this desire as well.  Tons of people have come before you and remained sober for the rest of their lives.  You can do it!  The resources are out there to succeed.  ..Even if you fuck it up- failure is just a part of the process and you'll learn from it.  Congrats on making a full month.  That's really awesome. 
Congrats on making it 31 days!!  That is a huge milestone take a minute to feel proud of yourself!..I've got 387 days as of today and while the desire has not gone away it comes a lot less frequently for me.  Maybe 3 or 4 times a month now I really want to grab a bottle as opposed to in the beginning where I was thinking about it constantly...Good luck on your journey you've already made the hardest steps!
I don't know if it goes away. I think it does get less intense the further you get from your sobriety date. It helps to have tools in your life that are alternatives to drinking when you're stressed out. When I get upset now instead of thinking about alcohol I'm more likely to think "well better talk to my therapist or partner or sponsor. Better yet better get to a meeting today." 
Yes.  It still happens but the frequency and intensity greatly diminish over time.  For me around 5 weeks the desire to get obliterated dropped off.
