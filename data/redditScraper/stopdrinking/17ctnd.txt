This is not the forum for this...I recognize that fact...Rather it is my story. An unvarnished retelling of a part of a larger more confusing whole...It's for you although you will probably hate me by the end...Although the I'm hoping the mods will regard this narrative as one of sufficient benefit to those struggling here it's primary *raison d' tre* is not to address solely the problem of alcohol addiction and abuse...Rather it's purpose is self-centered. Entirely so...My aim?..I seek respite...Therefore here it is. My life:..It ended for me on a bus stop bench..."Don't mom. DON'T. I don't wanna go. I wanna stay with *you*."..Mom was mad. She got mad a lot of time. But this time felt different. As we rolled along the interstate and she abruptly took the exit with her face livid with anger this time felt very different..."I fuckin' told you. I'm going to leave you at the police station. Your dad will pick you up after a few days."..This doesn't make sense I realize. No way would the State every act as an impromptu babysitting service for an opiate addict's child. But at age nine I didn't know better. How could I?.."Mom *please.* I'm SORRY. I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go!" Tears poured down my face as I pulled the door of the minivan open. The pavement whipped past as I unbuckled my seat belt and prepared to jump. My younger siblings some in carseats watched on in horror...Eventually the car was stopped and we sat down on a park bench to reconcile...Shit like this happened a lot. Mom would get mad and blow up. ..Some of the time it was spectacular like when she threatened to abandoned me a thousand miles from home or when she took and loaded a rifle and pointed it the family dog in the middle of the living room but most of the time it was fairly pedestrian. ..She would single one of us out either myself or a sibling or Dad and would procede to vent for hours. Yelling. Screaming. ..When Dad *wasn't* getting yelled at he'd watch. He'd sit passively and when solicited for opinion one way or the other he'd invariably affirm Mom and wait for her to burn out. Being the oldest combative and earnest I was frequently the target. During these bouts I'd look at him pleadingly . . . to no avail...There was never any physical abuse. Sure there was the occasional ill-considered chastisement with the broad end of a wooden spoon or an object flung in anger but there was never any direct violence to the body...The soul? Well *you* decide...Flash forward. I'm fourteen and I'm alone in the basement. My folks were religious people of sorts and so kept us home instead of letting us enroll in a public or private school...I spent up to eighteen hours a day in that basement listen to the crackle of talk radio. I craved contact of peers of other people. But that contact was sparse. About two-to-three times a month I was allow to spend substantial time with the kids in the neighborhood. The rest? Nothing but my immediate family and that stale transmission of AM radio day after day...Now I'm eighteen. Now I'm going to college. Now I'm signing a contract with the Army saying that if they pay for my college I'll serve for four years. Despite the fact that Dad worked and Mom spent much of the time in a medicated stupor I manage to get out and have my school paid for by Uncle Sam...Maybe *that's* an older family member I can count on . . ...But I'm awkward. I have the unflagging jingoism of a young man with an ideology inculcated by hours of transmitted propaganda but I'm awkward. I have trouble making friends. I don't play well with others...But I'm young. I'm brave. I find achievement and even love. I bury the demons and find the girl...Then I hurt myself. My shoulder gives. A rotator cuff injury that remains undiagnosed for *years.* Then my back acts up. An heretofore unknown case of scoliosis gives me chronic back pain making abdominal exertion agony. Then my ankle gives. Tendonitis afflicts me one morning running...And then I don't run. ..*I don't run ever again.*..Along with the other conditions I work through the pain. But I can't run and then comes the depression. ..It comes about the same time the girl goes...Then the drinking arrives. It arrives slowly but then ramps up. It ramps up as the depression ramps up...Now I'm twenty-one. Never had sex (the girl was of religious people too and I am faithful) and physically spent. With drinking comes weight gain. I get fatter and drunker and work myself into the state of dissipation...Still crave that connection. Try to rekindle old friendships. Start new friendships...Go to a party. Get near-blackout drunk only to have a "friend" put me to sleep...Takes me down to his basement...Vague noises from the party upstairs..."Friend" is gay. "Friend" . . . ..Alone now...The gun sits next to me on the desk. ..I load it...I think "this is it."..The vodka lies next to the gun...But this isn't it...I put the booze and the weapon away and I get in my car. I call a suicide hotline and don't kill myself that night...The panic attacks come though and come hard. I wake up drenched in sweat. The alcohol doesn't help...I get in my car again and this time I don't stop...I drive . . . West. I drive and drive from the Midwest until I hit Nevada...Stop by a brothel. Loose my virginity. Get back in my car and drive until I hit an ocean...The sand on the beach is warm. The water is cool. I feel . . . calm...But the problems with the Army aren't resolved. Nothing is resolved...I have taken Uncle Sam's money and he wants it back...Drinking accelerates despite therapy. With the drinking comes unpredictable moments. Demons come out...More booze. More whores...Hate myself for both. Hate the person I have become...Drink and drink and drink...Go overseas. Meet new girl. Tell girl everything...Girl is cool...Twenty-six now. Admitted to law school. Survive three instances of major depression with suicidal ideation with plans...Deep into debt. Go to private school. Pay $200K for degree...Don't know when I will be with girl. Wonder why girl doesn't want to be with me. ..Don't know about future. Don't know the point of it all...Drink...Break up...Go on bender...Wake up on bus stop bench...[Day Three.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/149293/72_hours/)

You are *wayyyyyyy* too hard on yourself. ..I know it's tough but the past is the past. We have two options: to romanticize our past pain or to look to the future where almost anything is possible. There is no monopoly on happiness. We've all got whoppers in our past: some worse than you some not as bad. ..So if you want to be the lifetime victim of every single circumstance then have at 'er but know this is a choice. We looooove our pain. It's a weight on our shoulders that justifies all the other choices we've made. You won't be able to forget the past but you don't have to actively carry it on your shoulders at all times. Forward man. Forward. ..Also don't delete your account. You have a great writing style and I look forward to reading your posts! 
I don't hate you. I don't even *know* you. But I notice you have a badge and are participating and deal with the same shit I do on a daily basis. I don't hate myself so I don't hate you. Don't be so hard on yourself. We all have to live with some shitty mistakes we've made and I'm pretty sure we all hurt a lot of people along the way. What matters is that you're aware of these things. That you give a shit. That you want to be a better person. Those are the reasons I love you. Those are the reasons that I have nothing but joy in my heart when I see your username on this sub. Smile more we're here for you. 
I don't hate you Respite.  And I don't want you to go away.  I look forward to reading your posts and comments...Others have posted some really meaningful responses to you so I think I'm just going to ask: Don't go.  Please stay.  Keep posting.  /r/stopdrinking helps me.  And I hope it can help you too.  Stop by the webchat/IRC (in the sidebar) if you want a real-time conversation.  Do what you have to do to stay on the path of recovery...
