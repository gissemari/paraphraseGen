First I want to thank the moderators and every contributor on this forum.  You've played a huge role in helping me get my life together.  This place is incredible.  I've come clean with my wife and family about my struggles and feel so much better about myself and my future.  I've been sober for 13 days and have no desire to look back.  Its pretty cool to be able to think clearly and not be drunk hungover or irritable as fuck all the time.  ..Just wanted to share a quick story about a recent grocery store visit... this was a few days ago so I'd been sober for about a week.  As I passed the aisle with all the liquor I didn't even think twice about it.  Felt incredible to feel like I'm in control for once.  ..A few minutes later after getting all the groceries on my list and texting my wife to confirm I'm buying the correct baby formula (not making that mistake again) I push my cart into the checkout lane.  As I'm about to finish the checkout I grab my wallet and pull out my credit card and my drivers license.  A split second later I'm thinking to myself "you don't need your license you idiot."  I laughed out loud to myself and the checkout girl probably thought I was psychotic as I'm standing there laughing at my wallet.  I don't remember the last time I bought groceries without including a bottle of vodka.  Crazy to think that was such a standard routine.  Hopefully next time I realize I only need the credit card :)..Again thanks to everyone who contributes here.  I'm glad to finally be a part of the group.  Have a great day everyone and stay strong.

Every shopping trip always ended up in the booze aisle.  Crazy I used to hide the bottles underneath all the other shopping.  So glad I pass by that aisle now!  It's great to be part of this group - it keeps us all strong together.  You have a great day too! :)  IWNDWYT!
The small things can make the biggest difference...im glad you could laugh ..... well done on 12 days
