You know every time I have admitted that I have a drinking problem my loved ones would say  But you go offshore for days weeks months at a time and you're fine.  It's just at home you have the problem.  Why can't you do it here?   They're right in a way.  What's the difference?  First there is no alcohol offshore.  Now there are some who have been caught drinking hand sanitizer making jailhouse hooch or od'ing on NyQuil to cure their shakes but I never had to resort to that.  Mine was mental.  I thought about it.  I dreamt about it.  I passionately talked about it when the subject came up showing off my knowledge of fine bourbons.  I couldn't wait to get home not just to be back on land see my wife and pets but to have that first drink.  .On day 5 since my last drink I still thought about it.  I dreamt about it.  But it was different.  I didn't yearn for that first drink back home.  I feared it.  My dream last night was relapsing.  My thoughts were of how am I going to carry on without drinking.  These thoughts made me realize how bad of a grip alcohol had on me.  Who thinks that way?  I put booze ahead of my marriage my family my job my finances even my health.  .I stopped smoking pot 7 years ago.  And I smoked alcoholic style....all or nothing.  But once I had my mind made up I was done with it and never looked back.  Now it's mostly legal better quality and I can watch people smoke in front of me.  No worries.  I recently had to change my diet.  At 227 lbs My doctor said that I was a candy bar away from pancreatitis.  He didn't know about my drinking.  I cut back drastically on carbs and sugar started going to the gym and lost 25 lbs.  Keto works!  What gets me is that I can kick the pot sugar and carbs to the curb with no problem but not drinking.  This is how I know that I am an alcoholic.  This why that I have to accept that this is a fight for my sanity my health my marriage my relationships and my life.  And I will win one day at a time...IWNDWYT
