Here I sit hung over and hating myself again.  I relapsed back in December hard and its taken me this long to try and pull myself back out of that hole.  I started this journey last March and here I am all over again starting over.  I've got so many ruined relationships because as soon as I fall into that pattern nothing else matters...just the booze.  I hate what a flaming narcissist alcohol turns me into.  I thought I could moderate but it affects every aspect of my life and I dont like the human I am when I drink.  So here's to a serious attempt and tentative hope that I can pull myself out of this.  I aint drinkin today yall.

Welcome back. Glad to have you hear. Just putting your mind to it and starting day one is a big part of the battle. You have done that. I will not drink with you today.
Yeah there was a time where I thought I could moderate too.....I moderated my self right into oblivion lol..I also remember the alcohol induced narcissist it was me overcompensating for my lack of confidence sober I think...at any rate hop back on the wagon there is room for all up here. Try not to fall off as its a long way down and it hurts... a lot 
I went through the same thing 7 days ago. I learned that moderation didn't work because old habits took over. Don't hate yourself for failing. Love yourself for trying. Love every day you keep trying even if you're starting over.
Good luck I cannot moderate my drinking either - keep telling myself If I can resist that 1st drink - then I can avoid the 20 or so that will inevitably follow after !! 
My sleeps improved 100% - took a week or so to get over the initial stopping - but worth it - also have so much time and motivation to do things is amazing how much time I devoted to alcohol - so far can't see any downsides to stopping - just improvements - good luck - IWNDWYT
