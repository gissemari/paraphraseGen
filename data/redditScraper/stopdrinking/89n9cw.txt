It's been 8 days definitely not the longest I've gone without a drink but it's definitely the most I've struggled. The first 4 days were a breeze but 5-7 were where the voice started taking over. ..It's currently 1am here and I'm not craving...However my sleep cycle is messed up. I'm unemployed right now so that probably doesn't help but basically I've been going to bed around 5pm and waking up at 2am. Yesterday I went for a nap around 1pm and crashed until 9. I got up to eat then fell asleep again til now...Anyone else experience this? I have been trying to develop better sleeping patterns so I end up waking up at 3 (for working out in the morning) but I've ended up sleeping 12-14 hours a day. Is this my subconscious way of avoiding alcohol or something?

My sleep cycle is completely screwed. I can't sleep until the wee hours and then sleep half the day. Today I slept four hours from 1 pm to 5 pm. I woke up exhausted and disoriented. Now it's 3 am and I can't get back to sleep. Ugghhh
Im right with you at 9 days. Its hard and I been getting that second voice too. My sleep is messed up too but I work overnights 9pm-3am so ill take it whenever i can during detox. The really restful sleep has been a huge turner for me I love it.
I think everyone has sleep issues at first.  Many said that they still felt tired even after a lot of sleep for a couple of weeks.  Lot's of repair going on.  IWNDWYT
