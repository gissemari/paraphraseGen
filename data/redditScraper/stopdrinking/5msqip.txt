Today instead of feeling sluggish sick and ashamed I have/am:..- Made my kids breakfast.- Played with my toddlers.- Facetimed with my sister & in-laws.- Laundry (and it's not an overwhelming amount since I've actually kept up with  it lately).- Deep cleaning.- Listening & dancing to Leon Bridges.- In a great mood.- Hopeful.- Fulfilled.- Riding on that pink cloud as long as I can :)..Thanks for sharing your stories & struggles. You all have helped me more than you know! Xo!
