I feel very lucky to be able see that I have a problem. I've been struggling with trying to get sober for a few weeks and getting better at it everyday. My friends also have problems but for whatever reason they can't see it. One of them is probably going to lose her kids she's dating an abusive jerk and somehow still she thinks its under control. One of my family members is severely drinking instead of getting his cancer treated but he always talks about how "those alcoholics should make a choice to control their drinking like I do". He is literally choosing to drink instead of live.It really is a blessing to become self aware of the harm you are doing so you can do something about it.

&gt; I feel very lucky to be able see that I have a problem...It took me a long long time to see it.  Once I did I thought 'how could I be so blind?'  I remember that so I don't go back.  I'm not sure I'll get a second chance.
It really is the first step to improving your life. Thanks for posting this.
Welcome back mate. It's horrible to watch people you care for destroy themselves. I guess there is some solice in knowing you don't have to join them. I'm happy that you've chosen to join us Sobernauts. I will not drink with you today mate.
