For those that might be struggling to kick alcohol into touch at the moment maybe science can persuade you that you can change and all is not lost? ..http://bigthink.com/ideafeed/good-news-science-buddha-agree-theres-no-you?utm_campaign=Echobox&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Facebook#link_time=1467067390..Now I'm nearly 6 months in my new habits have had time to bed in. I no longer think of booze in the same way as I once did. It's not the relaxant I thought it was. It's not the social enabler I thought it was. It was holding me back from being who I want to be (still working on this one)...We're all a work in progress it's also the same reason why alcoholism is described as progressive. My body's response to alcohol is different now to how I responded 20 years ago. ..I'm changing and if you want it so can you...I won't drink today.

Hey I like that. Great article and post. I love to see empirical knowledge and anectdotal experience backed up by the science...A good personal example is for me to just look at all the different times over the months and years I've described my higher power here. I've even gotten to the point where I include a disclaimer that notes that it is unlikely that my current definition matches all that well with the one from just a few months ago...I think change keeps it interesting. I'm trying to better my lot in life so I hope I'm changing! Gotta keep moving it forward. :).
Wow several great points!..&gt;our thoughts are real but not true ......My mind lies to me regularly.  This is why I've come to believe that the "reasons" for what I do or don't do don't matter.  My mind will arrive at a *good* reason for everything I do.  In fact I've not once in my life heard someone say "you know I had a really *bad* reason for doing such and such."..For me the currency of justification is worthless:  (1) everyone has a good reason for what they do. (2) there is no cost to produce a reason. (3) The supply of reasons is infinite.  (4) no one will pay for or purchase my reasons (if they like mine they simply produce a copy at no production cost; although there *may be costs associated with implementation and accompanying effects* such as DUIs damaged relationships poor health etc.). (5) since all reasons are equivalent with zero production and exchange or transfer fees therefore **reasons have zero value**!..My reasons don't matter.  My actions do.  As Yoda says: "Do or Do Not; There is no Try."..I think a supporting corollary here is related to Zen and meditation or mindfulness.  "The Empty Mind".  Ceasing the internal dialogue takes me out of the realm of "self".  When my mind is not analyzing and producing and endless stream of chatter and 'reasons for what I should or should not do' I can be present...I'm present now.  I have an action not a justification: just for today I don't drink with you u/BadToTheTrombone !.
Great article! ..I clicked through some of the links from "verified" and ended up at [this abstract](http://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/abstract/S1364-6613(15)00152-7). "Scientific research highlights the central role of specific psychological processes in particular those related to the self in various forms of human suffering and flourishing. This view is shared by Buddhism and other contemplative and humanistic traditions which have developed meditation practices to regulate these processes." I think it's very interesting that meta-cognition being aware of how we are thinking is at the heart of many different applications from meditation psychological change habit-hacking decision making in high-stress environments and economics (Kahneman's Type 1/2 thinking specifically)...If you're interested in the subject [here's an article I like that explores similarites between Buddhism and Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy](http://thetaoofrecovery.com/2012/05/17/the-philosophy-of-unconditional-acceptance/).
"That is our internal thoughts are only thoughts and don't define us. External events are only external events and aren't happening to us personally."..good stuff right there.
Thanks for sharing.  I read posts I submitted here a couple years ago (under a throwaway) and I can't relate at all to the guy who wrote them.  I always think "wow things were really that bad."
