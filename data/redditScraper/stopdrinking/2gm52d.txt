Hello SD Family - Haven't posted in a couple of days.  Needed to say hi and a reminder to not get too cocky.   There was a send off work party scheduled for this evening.  I've known about it for a bit.  Prepared wasn't going to be a big deal.  The inner voice / urges has been very quiet lately.  Im in the groove got this stuff down.   And wouldn't you know it as Im getting dressed this morning the voice goes off as clear as a bell. Just one drink sure would be good.    Holy shit.  I wasn't tempted - beat the F'er back in a hurry.  Literally laughed with all the good stuff I have going on.  Why the hell do I need a beer.   But it did get me to thinking.  Im at 40 days I can relate to the stories about relapse and if you loose your pattern the discipline how easy it would be to have a misstep..Take Care All - Safe Journeys to you.    And of course going to bed sober with another victory.

I was **SHOCKED** at how fast that inner voice returned after giving birth. After they left last Monday I immediately discovered Sarah+post partum depression+being alone=relapse scared the crap out of me bad enough to move in with family 48 hours later changing the equation to Sarah+post partum depression+family support= continued recovery.

Rock on and bravo!!!
Good job staying strong! Every day is a victory when we overcome that temptation. We have learned and know better. We can't be normal drinkers. Nice f*#%ing work!
When I hear that voice I stop what I'm doing and play the tape forward every time.  Once I imagine everything that will transpire in the next 24 hours if I take that 'one' drink I don't want it anymore....It's an incredibly powerful tool.
