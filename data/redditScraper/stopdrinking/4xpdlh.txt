I don't know if I would call myself an alcoholic but I certainly have an unhealthy relationship with drinking. I drink when I'm anxious and I drink to the point where I'm sick. I drink because I feel out of place if I don't and I realize that's a problem. I am currently dealing with the repercussions from an OUI I was charged with last year because I let myself believe I needed alcohol to deal with any stressful situation even when I was driving. I'm done with this stupid unnecessary drug ruining my life in every way - physical emotional mental financial legal etc.....This weekend I made a deal with myself that I would not have any alcohol. I went to a concert on friday and didn't drink - which was something I would never do before. I realized how much money I saved not buying the 10 dollar beers they were selling. Yesterday I hung out at the house by myself doing errands which again is a task I would usually just throw a few beers back for. Resisted the temptation again and realized I was just fine without it. ..Then about an hour ago I was just laying in bed relaxing and waiting for my friends to arrive who are visiting. I went to grab some food out of the fridge and saw a beer hiding in the back. I was so tempted - realized that one beer would do nothing but make me have to pee a lot make me groggy and be a waste of calories. But I still grabbed it out of the fridge. ..I took two sips and poured it down the drain after realizing it was not worth it. I never thought I would be capable of doing that. And the best part is it didn't even feel that bad. I realized I've been having a great weekend without it and honestly feel so much less groggy and weighed down. I know it's a small step but I'm proud of myself. ..I realize the journey to stopping drinking won't be that easy and I'm sure I'll have some slip ups in the future and will most likely struggle... But it's really refreshing and nice to know that I CAN survive a weekend and my life without booze. I'm out of the mindset that I need it to get through the day and that's a great feeling...I hope to be a regular in this sub and am glad to have all you like-minded people with the same goal as me :) Have a great day everyone!
