This week has been a struggle. I had planned to go back to college in the Fall but my original plan just seems to not be working. My boyfriend and I had planned to start building a house this year and that's not working either. I'm feeling very trapped and suffocated with where I'm at in my life in general and I am craving the hell out of a glass of wine right now. I won't do it but last night and this afternoon have been the first time I have really gotten a craving...In the past wine was how I dealt with stress. I have always had anxiety and drinking was the only way I used to deal with it...Ultimately today I'm just pissed off at myself. Because of my drinking I dropped out of college. Now it is so damn hard to get back into it now that I'm older. I know what alcohol has cost me and recently I have really been feeling its effects. I wish I could go back to the first time I had a drink in college and undo it because living with the consequences has been overwhelming. I wish I could have stopped drinking sooner...I don't mean to be a downer it just helps to get this off my chest! I am learning healthier coping mechanisms for dealing with my anxiety but sometimes it just all seems to build up at once. Thanks for reading IWNDWYT

IWNDWYT either...WE can't change the past but we can make a better today and tomorrow
Sorry things aren't going as planned at the moment. You're doing great though! I talk long walks to deal with stress and anxiety. It definitely takes time to build better habits and reactions to stress. I get down on myself for waiting so long to get sober too but the important thing is that we're doing it now. IWNDWYT
