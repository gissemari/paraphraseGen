https://imgur.com/a/YVuI9 https://imgur.com/a/tODu4..I think the pictures say it all! The first one is me a few weeks back. The second during my height of drinking....Physically and mentally I feel fantastic! I also think I am a much nicer person sober than I ever was a drunk.. ..For anyone struggling I had SO many relapses before I got here.. Every single one strengthened my resolve. ..I'll leave you with my Sobriety calendar quote:   A word of encouragement during failure is worth more than an hour of praise after success.' ..Stick with it! I promise you it's totally worth it! ..You're all amazing. I can't thank you enough SD'ers. ..Much love ..Butterfly   ..
