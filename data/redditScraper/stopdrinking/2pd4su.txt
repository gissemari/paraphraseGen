Lucky number 7. ..Will be thinking of you two. Glad you took the time to share here. 
Hang tough Mouse.  My thoughts are with you and the H.
I don't have anything for you that you don't already know but i've got prayers and I've got [this](http://i.imgur.com/zQCKBPV.jpg).
Hang in there sending lots of positive vibes your way.
((Hugs)) to you.
I'm so sorry.  Thanks for posting- you are so incredibly strong.  Sending positive thoughts your way.  
Lots of strength to you Mouse! You're proof to all the rest of us that there's NOTHING that happens today that needs drunk over.
Still with you! Hang in there!
Keep fighting! I read your share over the weekend - you've faced a lot of obstacles and you're still alive and kicking! You guys will beat this obstacle as well
Rooting for you both
Hey Mouse hugs! You guys are in my thoughts
All we got is today! Keeping you and yours in my thoughts!
Stay strong mouse and spouse! I wish you guys the best good luck!
Staying sober in solidarity my friend. You are a tough cookie. Thank you for your post. And congrats on your 7. I'm in an airport with no reason to drink other then being in an airport. But I gotta coffee. I'm staying sober. Today will be a win for all of us regardless of what happens if we don't drink. ..Much love to you. My friend ( the person who inspired me to get sober in the first place back in May) is going through something similar ( chronic myeloid leukemia) and I know how agonizing and unpredictable it is. But you are strong and sober. ..Much respect..
Hang in there. You're doing the right thing by reaching out for help. Do what it takes to stay sober - you got this.
Thoughts and prayers go out to you.
