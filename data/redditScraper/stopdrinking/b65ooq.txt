I've made a few attempts in the past one which resulted in a seizure which completely scared me away from trying to quit again...About three years ago I started having debilitating panic attacks. I didn't seek help I didn't even know what they were.  My brain sort of shut off and I developed agoraphobia. For those who don't know what that is it's basically a fear of going outside your house or comfort zone fear of panic attacks. For about 3 years all I did was drink. I didn't leave the house for anything except to get booze and food. I was done my life was (and still kind of is) a mess and honestly I was just kind of just waiting to die. ..I turned 33 in December.  I decided that I wanted my life back. I wish I could tell you guys exactly what happened in my brain but I'm still struggling to figure it out. I wanted my life back and I knew that I had to quit drinking in order to do this...So here I am. I tapered over the course of about a month to avoid another seizure. Over the past week I did not want to drink at all and had to force myself to take shots. I'm down to 1 shot tonight but I'm not going to drink it because I'm over it. The desire to drink is just not there anymore. I credit This Naked Mind (which I am going to finish up tonight) with this...For the first time in years I have hope for the future. I've started working out again. I want to go back to school find a good women and maybe have kids. I just hope it's not too late for this. ..Anyways. There is hope. Thanks for reading. IWNDWYT. ..
