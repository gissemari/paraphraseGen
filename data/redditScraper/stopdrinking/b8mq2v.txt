It took me 10 years to string 90 days together. I don't plan on drinking today. I wanted to write this a reminder for myself:..**How it was:**..For almost a decade with some prolonged pauses here and there every single day was misery chaos and confusion. ..Days there were not prolonged benders started with me begging the alarm for more time followed by horrible shits dry heaving in shower followed by a half awake drive to work and frantic attempts at waking up   greasy breakfast coffee Gatorade aspirin. This was followed by Xanax to calm the anxiety. Yep. ..Lunch time was not for socializing but for more unhealthy food trying to sneak in a nap in my car and hating life. ..Cut to 3:30 PM start getting the itch. Drive to gas station get at least 18 beers a pack of smokes and leave in car get back to work. White knuckle 1 hour of  work ...Drinking started with a couple of beers chugged  surreptitiously  in car washes/parking lots near office. This followed a buzzed long drive home where the gloves came off. Always had at least 3 beers in hand. ..Chain smoking drinking calling people social media chaos until 11 PM. Eat whatever crap I can find at around midnight. Try to pass out wake up thirsty atleast a couple of times.. .Repeat. ..I had no interest in living or the things I loved. I made multiple shitty suicide attempts. I was done finally because my body and mind couldn't take it anymore. Bounced a bit on the bottom but finally skidded to a halt on Jan 2nd of this year. ..**How it felt/feels:**..I drank because I could not deal with my emotions. Here's how I felt ..Month 1: .Week 1: Very strong urges which went away after eating/drinking soda or seltzer water..Week 2: Strong urges when emotionally uncomfortable. Was miserable but sober...Week 3: Strongest urges! Went to more meetings asked for help ate whatever I wanted..Week 4: Feeling kinda stable low urges..Month 2:..Absolute wreck emotionally. All the shit I was avoiding started cropping up and the urges were intense.  Went to more meetings got a sponsor. Started seeing doctors for GI troubles (shitting blood) had a colonoscopy had a prostate cancer scare had lots of lab work done. All results were okay! ..Month 3:..Less of an emotional rollercoaster. Still thinking crazy thoughts but not acting on any. The urges are almost gone. **Finally here is what worked for me:**..- Going to as many AA meetings as possible.- Reading and posting on r/stopdrinking .- Being honest with myself and others.- Being willing to take suggestions from other alcoholics.- Trying to help others even if it is simply texting someone to ask if they are okay.- Healthy diet - dropped 21 lbs!.- Seltzer water galore.- Seeing a therapist and psychiatrist for depression and anxiety and weaning off Xanax.- Taking long walks starting drum lessons auditioning for and getting into a band as a guitarist. ..And the most important one - - **Actually picking up the phone and calling an AA friend when I felt the urge to drink and could absolutely have had gotten drunk.** I finally agree with AA on one thing in particular   rigorous honesty is the only way I can stay sober. ..I still have a long way to go and struggle with poor memory and lack of concentration or focus but this way is the only way ahead for me because the other way literally does not work for me anymore and will result in jail institutions or death sooner than later. ..Thanks for reading and IWNDWYT..

Huge congratulations to you and thank you so much for sharing and reminding us why this journey is so valuable...Memory and focus will find their way back to you also    
I like the stop worry about others. I had struggled with that. Thinking I got shit going on no one gives a fuck about me. But my friends are pretty self absorbed. 
Congratulations and thank you for sharing!
