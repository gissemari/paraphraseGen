I guess the thought of never drinking again has set in again (as this is the can't even count how many times I've tried to quit). ..I've never had support like this though and I love waking up without a hangover. ..Thanks y'all!

Congrats on 4 days! IWNDWYT.
4 days and you are on your way. It's tough to do sometimes but I try very hard not to worry about future days. Today is the only day we need to focus on. We won't drink TODAY rinse repeat. Hangover free mornings ROCK right?!.
The best thing to do is not think of it as forever. Just take it one day at a time and watch the days stack.
Great work. I have been focusing on healthy balanced living. Makes not drinking easier for me. I will not drink with you today.
I tried to ignore it like push it out of my mind and do something else or focus on something else.  Like it didn't exist or it just wasn't on the menu even.  Jedi mind trick myself
