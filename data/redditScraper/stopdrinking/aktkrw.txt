Hey guys. First time posting. After trying to get sober since before the holidays and relapsing twice I had my first day of outpatient treatment today and it went great. Thank you all for the positive posts in this sub that have made me decide to take the first step. I am 5 days sober now and look forward to continuing treatment. It feels so great to finally come out and say i need help and take the first step. I also look forward to being part of this community and helping others. Thanks again!
