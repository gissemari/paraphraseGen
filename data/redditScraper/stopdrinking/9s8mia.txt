I've had two withdrawal seizures in the past.  I just relapsed for two weeks and drank a bit.  Am I at risk again?  Do I need to get myself into detox?  I'm scared of it happening again... I'm a little shaky and I'm going to stop drinking for good.  I really don't want to be in the hospital for a few days.  Can I get the pills another way?

The only thing that any one of us can do is to tell you to see a doctor. The internet is not a good source of medical information and withdrawal can be dangerous even deadly. We have removed your post and hope you'll seek medical support.
