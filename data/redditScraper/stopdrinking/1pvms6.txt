Quick run down:..I recently had a situation where my wife failed to cover part of our budget that she is responsible for. Up until 5 weeks ago when we got married it was never a problem. Upon combining our finances for ease of budget and wanting to purchase a home and have everything in one place I found out she was taking out short term loans from her bank at roughly 10%. It appeared to me she was kind of caught in a small loan spiral after finding out that she had been using it regularly for months. I was left to cover the missed portion of our budget which since I'm not drinking was not an issue. If that was the case I'd probably be even more upset since she was getting her hands on my alcohol money. ..But I was still upset. I felt as if I was lied to or kept things secret from. We tried discussing the issue and it turned into World War III. I blew up saying calling her a liar and telling her she was failing. Now I don't think is is a failure. She's a great mother she goes to school 2 days a week and works part time. I work full time as an audio engineer. We are busy people. We both said mean/hurtful things. Our relationship is pretty damaged. I was super scared to get married because sometimes I feel like I got married so I can get divorced.....Not sure if this makes any sense or what I'm looking for. I just had to get it off my chest. I'm sad hurt scared. It seems like the only thing I can do lately is stay sober and just not drink. Everything else just seems to have the wheels coming off.

Such a situation would be very difficult to wrap my head around. I strongly suggest you see a marriage counselor to help you navigate these rough waters. ..I remember similar heartaches in my early sobriety. As you said "wheels coming off". It was a training ground for using the program of AA. My sponsor meetings counselor and the steps gave me the tools to cope with tough times and stay sober.
I've gotten stuck in that small loan spiral. It totally sucks. It's embarrassing and it's really hard to get out of. ..Keep up the not drinking. As a perpetually single person I have no real advice for your marriage. But it does sound like you overreacted at your wife harshly. What she's done is frustrating and not that wise but not the end of the world. Screaming at someone because they couldn't cover their financial responsibility seems like a bit much to me. 
You have every reason to be upset.  Ya'll are supposed to be a team and share the responsibilities she tried to hide what was going on so you wouldn't be upset with her and ended up getting stuck in a bad situation.  That being said we're all human and make mistakes.  Resentment is poison for the soul just as alcohol is poison for the body. ..Congratulations on staying sober through this.  It's easy to keep on the right track when things are going well.  It's when we are faced with stress and problems that we have to find a new way to cope with our emotions instead of just hiding from the world...Let the feelings run their course try to work on having more open communication with your spouse and forgive her.     
Hmm. I'd say that's kind of a big deal to hide something like that. Even if it wasn't a huge amount of debt I'd feel the same way you would. You don't want to marry someone else's problems. You've only been married for 5 weeks but you have a child so I assume you were living together prior? So she'd been doing it a while and hiding it. I get how that's a big deal to you. It definitely would be to me and was in my relationship when I found out she was hiding something...I guess the thing to remember is that at one point you were probably hiding something too drinking [whether amounts times or even just hiding being drunk.] So it's not like you were a saint before right?..You're married now. You've got a partner a confident a co-captain [and sometimes an anchor] but you've got someone with you. One thing I've been able to do since I'm not half-blitzed all the time is to find out what I can learn from bad situations. Personally I would take this as a time to learn that my wife has issues with guilt issues with letting problems be out in the open and problems with telling me about problems. She probably doesn't like to show weakness or admit she was wrong or needs help. That's not good and I'd feel bad she couldn't share with me. She shouldn't feel like she has to go it alone without her husband. I'd use this as a way to make my marriage stronger rather than drive a rift in between us...Think about when you were a kid and you maybe fucked up or broke something or did some damage somewhere. You tried to hide it you tried to fix it but it just kept getting worse. Eventually your parents found out and they react one of two ways; they flip out on you tell you you're a piece of shit and punish you ***or*** they are obviously disappointed but realize you just didn't want to let them down or let them know you are only human and they work with you to fix the problem. It was still fucked up and you had to do the work to fix it but you knew they were there for you...You can do the same thing now. I'd obviously apologize for blowing up first and then say I felt hurt she couldn't share it with me that I want to be able to share failures not just successes. I'd also say that trust and openness is something I absolutely want in my marriage with her and this is going to have to be something we both work on moving forward. I'd say that she shouldn't feel ashamed or guilty because she had a problem and that it was probably very hard to hide it and probably affected her quite a bit. Then I'd tell her I loved her make some plans to work on the budget together and [read this book](http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/370599418070?lpid=82) with her TOGETHER. If you're the more financial minded one and you're the one that controls the budget/spending/planning she might feel bitter or resentful. You can still take the lead but include her on things. If she feels like she's a part in the decision making process even if you do most of the work she's going to feel better about it. Drunk or sober marriage is always a team sport and the most difficult one there is. Both parties have to feel like they matter. There are another couple of good books out there I'm sure you can find them out...Bottom line allow yourself and her a chance to cool off a chance for both to apologize and say why they felt hurt and then make this a ***learning experience*** and a reason for growth in your marriage not a reason to be angry or resentful at one another and hurt your marriage.
What you're saying sure makes sense to me.  And your post gives me an opportunity to talk about how I needed to work a program of recovery when I was newly sober.  By using the 12 Steps I was able to sort out a lot of the situations in my life and figure out how my selfishness and fear really set the stage for nearly everything that didn't work out the way I thought it was supposed to.  I was able to see that in most situations that caused me consternation my ego or my misplaced expectations or assumptions were at the root of the very thing that I thought justified me being angry.  Then I realized that my anger in itself presented new obstacles that I needed to overcome.  Listen for all these great insights I was not instantly cured but by working the 12 Steps of recovery I found a path to work through nearly every obstacle and feeling and place those obstacles aside and feelings in proper perspective.   Finally I was able to prioritize those relationships in my life and begin to value my real family and real friends over my alcohol cohort.  I could finally see that my life partner had in fact struggled mightily with challenges I had divorced myself from; and in turn it made forgiving her minor flaws and failures damn easy.
Just as many of have difficulties with things such as socialization many alcoholic or not have trouble with money.  My wife is in DA for this.  It is quite common does not need include excessive spending (though it can) and is characterized by a vagueness re money.  There is shame and secrecy involved as in drinking.  ..This can be fixed. Look up DA in your area....
My partner and I have had to learn to fight in recovery - although she never knew me drinking and regularly attends Al-anon she grew up in an alcoholic household so the patterns were there. ..We would fight over the stupidest things - who's turn it was to take out the cat litter - and what started as a petty argument would escalate out of control into who was going to pack who's bags and who would get to stay in the house. ..Eventually we went to a few sessions with a marriage counsellor who works a lot with recovery couples. I found out that I am very scared of my partner and that I really needed the safe space to be able to say what I was really thinking. Creating that listening space was very hard at first and on one occasion I stormed out slammed the door and left her there but gradually no matter how tough the sessions we would leave everything in that room and the make-up sex was awesome!..I guess we did around 10 sessions over 4 months or so some just her one just me most together and although it didn't turn on any bright light-bulbs at the time with hindsight it has helped us forge a much closer more intimate caring relationship where we support each other (and I don't always have to be right!)..I'm sorry to hear that you're going through difficult times OP the first year is really tough but it sounds as though you are doing exactly the right thing in opening up about it and sharing experience. ..When times are rough (and this year has been particularly tough - lost business lost baby immediate family alcoholism and cancer amongst other things) I try and hold on to the adage that 'smooth seas don't a sailor make'. ..We grow through dealing with pain in healthy recovery orientated ways and whatever happens as long as you don't pick up a drink you will emerge from this a stronger human being. After a share over the weekend I got a few comments back from people who have seen my whole sobriety saying how much I have changed for the better over the last 9 months that I am exuding a calm self-assurance that has never been there before. As they said it I could suddenly feel what they were seeing - growth through pain and the miracles of the promises in action...Good luck OP take it one day at a time and let us know how things go. ..Edit - The Inventory Process share by Scott R (look on xa-speakers) is great on this aspect of recovery - well worth a listen.
