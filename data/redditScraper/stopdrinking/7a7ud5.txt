Hey all!  Today I need advice on how to help my friend. Short backstory I am 11 months sober.  You'll get my  365 days holy crap life is amazing I'm so happy yee!!!!!  post shortly because I'm really excited to share all of that with you!! BUT today I am posting for a friend. ..One of my best friends is still struggling with alcoholism and he sees me and how well I am doing and he really wants to get there. I always let him come to me for help and never force the topic on him and I am very gentle and easy going every time we talk. That is what worked for me and I know it is the method he needs as well. ..I read Allen Carr a few years ago and it helped me quit drinking for a month but then I was back at it. I still learned a lot and the skills helped me mentally prepare to quit when I was really ready. ..When I was ready my sister showed me another book similar yet different. It was This Naked Mind by Annie Grace. It was very similar to Allen Carr but it stuck such a deeper chord with me. I really don't know if it helped me more because I am a woman or if it is truly a better book.  But it was THAT book that helped me quit for good and I feel like it was a miracle because it has been so easy and not a struggle AT ALL. ..My friend is a man so my question is to you guys and girls who have read both which one helped you more? Did it help you more because it was just a better book or because of the gender aspect? ..I already gave my friend the Annie Grace book for which he was grateful. He hasn't read it yet which is fine. I sat on it for a year before I read it. I know he is glad to have it for when he is ready. ..I don't know if I should give him the Allen Carr book also if it that would be putting too much in front of him which could overwhelm him and make him less likely to ready either. Or I could give it to him and tell him to read Allen instead? ..Thoughts?!?!?!

I think you are clearly well intentioned but probably over thinking this.  I can relate to you completely because my brother has a major drinking problem and I have tried to recommend books online resources you name it.  Guess what he's not interested. :)  ..If you must recommend something you could suggest he listen to a couple recovery podcasts like Recovery Elevator or since right now.  Maybe the different format will appeal to him!
It's nice you are trying to help your friend but I don't think there is a magical book that will be universally helpful to everyone. It's about the person wanting it for themselves and then trying a bunch of things to see what works for them! That being said as a 31 year old man I had a lot of success early by reading Rational Recovery.
