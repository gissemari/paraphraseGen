Just poured out all my triple beers. After relapsing this weekend I planned a final night of drinking to go out with a bang. As if today trembling at work wasn't bad enough. As if i would be able to get through the day tomorrow and think "well you said last evening was the last time." We all know how that goes. The shit we go through for two hours of painless escapism... Today was not a good day no mindbending on my part can change that. But i will not end my day in shambles with that false friend. This shit is hard. But so am I. Thank you for listening. Day 1.

Well I haven't been to two weeks since 2011 where I completed 2 sober years and continued into a 6.5 year relapse.  I'd say you are making progress don't beat yourself up!
Good move pouring out the beers.  That took strength! No time better than now to start again! IWNDWYT 
I hate to benefit from your pain but being reminded of "the shit we go through for two hours of painless escapism" is what keeps me from picking up that first glass. Glad you are back! 
We'll be here...Good luck.
Pouring them out is so hard. Good job!!!!!!!
