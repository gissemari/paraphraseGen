Relapsed where I left off...for a few days. I'd only been sober 3 weeks and had been attending daily meetings. One group I feel closer to and not just a visitor- I usually speak at meetings when I go but I wasnt comfortable telling anyone I had fallen away so easily. Is it something I should talk about?

Yes sure. You aren't the only one it has happened to. 
The only reason I ever had trouble getting a month under my belt was that I was concentrating on the month and not the day that should have been my true goal.  If I don't drink TODAY at the end of the month I will not have had a drink all month--because every day is today.
Yes you should speak up and be honest. You aren't the first one. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at how welcoming people will be towards you for admitting you relapsed and for coming back.
