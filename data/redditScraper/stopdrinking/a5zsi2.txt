Well this is it my now or never moment. I have gone through the roller coaster of quitting and relapsing too many times. It is exhausting I am sick of it and I don't think I have the mental energy left to quit again. Therefore I am taking the advice that I often see in this sub and I am writing down my plan. I am making a public yet anonymous declaration that I will no longer drink alcohol. ..&amp;#x200B;..Here is my plan:..&amp;#x200B;..\- Prepare mentally by reviewing the idea of never having a drink again and what that really means for my lifestyle. ..\- Make sure the important people in my life know my plan. The more people I tell the more accountable I will be to my decision. ..\- I will participate in one of my many hobbies at least once a week if not more. m..\- I will stop eating junk eat plenty of lean protein greens veggies and fruit...\- I am going to take a stack of vitamins minerals and plant supplements that support liver detox and other supplements in which alcoholics tend to be deficient. ..\- I am going to stock up on some LaCroix a little candy and plenty of snacks. ..\- I am going to start a varied workout routine. I will do some type of activity to the point of sweat every day even if I can only do 20 minutes...\-Check in here daily and read a lot of posts. ..\-Only view uplifting and interesting subs on Reddit..\-Set a calendar reminder not to drink to go off daily...\-

The key for me getting my current sober streak was accepting the idea of never having a drink again.  I had to finally accept it.
I downloaded an app called I Am Sober. In the morning it asks me to make a pledge to be sober and at night it asks me to review the day. It's helpful. ..Also it's awesome that you have a plan in place but I find the most important mindset to maintain my sobriety is the old "one day at a time." Yes my goal is to be done with alcohol forever. But forever is long. Forever is hard and uncertain. But one day? Shoot I can do anything for one day. ..Just try not to overwhelm yourself. It's a challenge but it's one you can absolutely overcome. ..IWNDWYT!
I really like your plan. I going to borrow it thank you for the great ideas. I feel like I'm loosing altitude and need to get immersed in those type of daily regiments..I've read The Naked Mind which really helped..Congratulations on your decision..I'm glad your here. You got this my friend.
