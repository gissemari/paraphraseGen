I've had a great recovery so far.  I've used Antabuse as help.   Unfortunately it makes me very tired.   I've talked to my doctor and recovery group and I've decided (with their support) to discontinue the drug. ..I'm posting this here to keep myself honest.   I've seen too many recovery friends stop Antabuse as a prelude to relapse.  I would like to stay sober. ..Thanks to everyone here for your support...Happy 24 everyone!

Good for you. I stopped taking campral at around 3 months with the support of my outpatient group and addiction counsellor. It was scary but I had a strong foundation and felt ready.
Kudos on 221 days!
Congrats!! I hope you well without it!..~ I was one of those lucky few who had horrible side effects with it but my assigned doctor wouldn't release me from inpatient without agreeing to take it. So I lied.... but my assigned therapist told me to (crazy right?!) and I went to my actual doctor to talk to her about it. All went well thankfully.
