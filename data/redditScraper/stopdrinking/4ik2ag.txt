I just stumbled across this sub and it appears to be exactly what I need. I am in a bit more of a unique situation than most in that I am 7 days sober and own/manage a bar on a day to day basis. After an embarrassing couple of days last week where I went on a bender at both my business and a few other local bars it became evident that I needed to address the problem. ..It has been an eye opening week of sobriety to say the least and I hope that I can stay strong enough to keep pushing forward. Being "surrounded" by the party has always been a struggle but I want and need to stay sober for my wife my kids and the future of my businesses...Just wanted to take a minute to share thanks!
