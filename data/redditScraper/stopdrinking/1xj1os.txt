But you're going to quit again!  What are you going to differently?  What didn't work?
&gt; some of us go out and get drunk despite our best efforts...Everyone is capable of quitting.  If you got drunk then it was not your best effort. ..You're not a victim here.  You **chose** to drink.  No one tied you down and poured alcohol down your throat.  There are millions of people who got into a fight with their SO this weekend and *didn't* pick up a bottle. You know how they do it? They choose not to. Despite what's going on in their lives they don't drink. You could have done the exact same thing. So please drop the "I'm special" bullshit and quit pretending that it's harder for you than it is for everyone else. The people who say "woohoo" say "woohoo" because they worked hard to earn those days. Instead of complaining about how it's harder for you you might try asking them how they did it. 
It is true that some of us go back out there despite our best efforts.  Maybe that means our best efforts are actually our best?  Or maybe it means that we need to re-think our efforts and approach and try something different this time around.  .Good luck...I hope you find it.
Try just quitting alcohol first.  Work on the weed and cigs later..
Welcome back.  Yeah I didn't find relapse all that useful.  Mine ended in some really dark days for me my family and friends.  The good news is that I don't feel the need to repeat it. 
&gt; i plan on quiting for good now. but i will see what happens..You can **decide** what happens. Passively waiting to "see what happens" sounds a lot like not taking responsibility for making a choice. What happens is drinking. You already know this. What you want to have happen is something different. ..Congrats on your month by the way. That's the toughest part in my experience. So you know you can do that and more. ..The way we do it is we figure out what didn't work and find more things that do work in supporting sobriety. You're thinking about the gym--exercise is a great help. What about other sources of support--meetings (AA SMART or other) books sober friends/mentors? And then keep working it. If we slip we get back up and keep going try to learn something and do something different. .
When quitting first crossed my mind it didn't happen right away. I can remember driving with a friend talking about how that marked the last time I was going to drink. That was a few years before I did. The seeds were planted in my heart but I was putting my social life first...I got a DUI after that. Still kept drinking. Then I was injured as a passenger in a DUI related accident. It wasn't until I thought my chest was caving in and I was having a heart issue did I decide to quit...By procrastinating I experienced things I otherwise wouldn't have. I wouldn't have been in certain situations. My life would have been a little easier more enjoyable healthier and my money wouldn't have been sucked down the drain...Now that I have quit I see all the benefits that I have gained. Mental clarity physical spiritual financial etc. It is like there is something new that pops up every now and again that reenforces that decision to remain sober. I feel so much further ahead in life...Sure there have been times where I am stressed and the brain comes up with the lacking idea of having a drink but I remember that disrupts the very foundation of me...Quit. Masking problems with drinking only gets worse and complicated as time waxes on.
I know the feeling of having done one's "best" and still failed. I am absolutely useless at choosing not to drink. I tried probably hundreds of times and I *always* changed my mind sooner or later. Since my willpower is so limited in this respect I need to drop the attitude that I can fix this on my own and reach out to others to the best of my ability. (Present tense because I have to do this over and over.) The reason I'm sober today is not because I tried harder the last time but because I gave up decided to ask for help and guidance and decided to adjust my attitude. The way I see it I cannot choose not to drink but I can choose to take 100% respnsibility for my recovery. When I do that I am somehow liberated from the desire to drink..Don't know if that helps. Thanks for posting and good luck.
Keep it simple. nobody is pouring that drink down your throat but you. start with one day or one hour or one minute or one second. Just start somewhere. I have to tell myself this almost every day.
