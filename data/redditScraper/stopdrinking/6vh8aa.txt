Got to thinking of all the times I'd risked my life and countless other people's lives by drunk driving. I'm ashamed to admit it. Honestly I am. ..I haven't done it for about a year but I started to think last night what a disgraceful person I am for having ever done it. And I started running through the What If scenarios and freaked myself out...I never want to get to a place again where my judgment is so all over the place and shot to pieces that I could ever risk that again...And I'm grateful to whatever is out there that kept me safe when my own poor judgment wasn't keeping me safe.

I think it's good to remember the bad judgments that alcohol brings and be grateful for the damage you didn't cause... I was at a meeting recently where the speaker drove drunk got into a accident and killed his best friend that was a passenger. Young guy took... he has to live with that for the rest of his life.
It takes a lot of self-growth to move past the regrets and what-ifs. Keep going and you'll get past them. I did and I never need to go back to places where my lack of judgement was endangering others with drunk driving.
