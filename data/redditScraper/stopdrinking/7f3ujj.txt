My birthday was Friday.  I had a few drinks which turned into a 6 day bender.  I am at home sick and can't even properly enjoy my thanksgiving dinner.  God I hope I never go through this again.

We mostly all do. It will only make you stronger. Fix what makes you drink and regret.
Nothing changes if nothing changes. What tangible actions are you going to take to remain sober?
I hope none of us does. I doubt I would live through another. Try hanging out here with us. We work towards not having this crap happen to us anymore. IWNDWYT
