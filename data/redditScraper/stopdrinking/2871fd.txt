But be forewarned: you will hear a lot of stories from people who tried (and failed at) moderating. There's a high correlation between people who have to make an effort to moderate and people who have the inability to do so...I tried moderating and it didn't work for me. Even if I could successfully abstain during the week I'd be spending the whole week looking forward to the weekend when I could drink. The mental obsession would stay alive. Being abstinent the obsession is gone and my mind is clear. I much prefer it that way....  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|25|3|setnavrec|*I gave myself a DUI today.* by suspend_disbelief|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/27mtvo/i_gave_myself_a_dui_today/ci2dj0a)|.Speaking as someone who has had a DUI all you say is true. I didn't hit anyone. Swerved to avoid a lawn bag in the road overcorrected and hit a ditch at 65-70mph. Totalled my beautiful car. Came thru unscathed...physically...bumps and bruises. .Financial ruin. Disappointment from friends and family court fines work program not to do jail time license suspended for awhile mandated nine month DUI class it's a literal nightmare. ..For many months after I didn't drink. At all. Then I had a personal crisis and it went down hill from there. Binging twice a week or so maybe three times...met a great guy got engaged moved in and the alcohol killed it. ..Now I don't care what happens. Sad. Mad. Happy. Whatever. I will not drink. Not even one. Because I can not have only one. I have an addictive personality same with smokes. Cant just have one.....Stay strong friend. Sober life is possible. . ...  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|24|7|coolcrosby|*Well it finally happened. I got the DUI I have deserved for well over a year. Now I just want to die.* by OldDexterMorgan|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/27ncso/well_it_finally_happened_i_got_the_dui_i_have/ci2hg7k)|.Dear u/OldDexterMorgan--I made it back from 5 months in federal prison 6 months of home confinement on an ankle bracelet and 2 years of federal probation in addition to crushing IRS indebtedness.  This dark moment can be the point from which your entire life changes for the better IF you are honest open minded and willing to change.  It requires nothing more than what I say to almost every newcomer for the last year--make a decision not to drink TODAY; go to recovery meetings (MOVE THE FEET); go to bed sober; and repeat.  Let time take time while you get and stay sober and your entire life can change.  ...  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|19|3|RonniePudding|*Is giving up daily drinking and keeping it exclusive to the weekends within the parameters of this sub?* by throwawaybooze123|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/27s9is/is_giving_up_daily_drinking_and_keeping_it/ci3ujfm)|.Most of us quit drinking completely because we tried moderating and discovered we couldn't. I tried a million times...The only way I could get rid of the dread and anxiety that started lasting until WEDNESDAY was to not drink on the weekends....  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|16|0|SOmuch2learn|*Are we still alcoholics?* by efrod|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/281wnp/are_we_still_alcoholics/ci6lc4c)|.I am three decades in recovery and have no problem identifying myself as a **recovering** alcoholic; I feel no social stigma whatsoever. Rather I am proud of my sobriety. "Label" is not the word I would use. Alcoholism is a medical diagnosis. My alcoholism is in remission because I no longer drink. If I started drinking again there's no doubt in my mind that in a relatively short amount of time life would start to spiral out of control. Alcoholism is a chronic disease in the same vein as diabetes and asthma. It does not go away just because we get older and wiser in recovery. My long-term sobriety is due in part to remaining vigilant to this fact. ...  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|16|5|JimBeamsHusband|*One Year Later: A thanks and a little on how I got and stayed sober.* by mrsixhundred|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/27vkf7/one_year_later_a_thanks_and_a_little_on_how_i_got/ci4t95a)|.Dude...This is so awesome.  In so many ways it's hard to believe that your 365 is finally here!  What's hard to believe is that you're not already celebrating 18 months at this point.  It was so soon after June 11 that you really "got it".  You quickly went from someone that was struggling for a reason to get/stay sober to someone who was living it. ..We'll have to get together soon to celebrate your new look your job success your new girlfriend and of course 365!...  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|15|1|JimBeamsHusband|*My experience with stopping for "x" amount of time...* by Nika65|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/27yqvt/my_experience_with_stopping_for_x_amount_of_time/ci5o2vc)|.Great post.  I can relate to some of that... the idea of proving I don't have a problem by quitting for a while to just pick up where I left off very quickly...I think the biggest help for me was realizing how ridiculous it was to give so much power to some drink.  I thought it was how I had fun how I relaxed what made me interesting and what to do when I was bored...Ahhh... life is so much better now....  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|15|2|SarahSiddonscooks|*Are these symptoms of alcoholism?* by Vatican_Cameos_|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/27te7u/are_these_symptoms_of_alcoholism/ci477u1)|.Those symptoms are almost required to be an alcoholic.....so yes they are all related to or caused by alcohol. Your wife's subtle hints aren't so subtle. If it this were me before I started any depression meds I would go 30 days sober if at the end of that time period if you have all the feelings you are having today taking them might be wise if you feel significantly better then you have your answer....  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|14|1|coolcrosby|*Fuck my stupid wife she wants to cut me out fine but I'm gonna be sober this weekend.* by formerlydrinkyguy77|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/282n2s/fuck_my_stupid_wife_she_wants_to_cut_me_out_fine/ci6twll)|.Someone on the sub pointed out earlier today or maybe it was over night anger and resentment is like drinking poison and waiting for the other person to die.  Let it go.  If I were you I'd get out of that situation and cleanly and calmly as possible and go on and live my sober life.  But without the hatred....  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|14|1|pollyannapusher|*From an alcoholic who is about to have his luck run out* by MyFinalChance|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/27s83s/from_an_alcoholic_who_is_about_to_have_his_luck/ci3uv57)|.>I was never comfortable with the serenity prayer..Just leave out the God part...that's what I do. I'm asking myself for the serenity to accept the things I cannot change the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference. Like asking myself to remember the milk but a lot more important. ..AA works for me but it doesn't for everyone. Have you tried SMART Recovery? Many people have found success that route. It uses CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) as it's basis. ..It sounds like you're sick and tired of being sick and tired. I can relate 100%. You can have that freedom you dream of my friend. You're already on your way!...  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|14|2|chinstrap|*I gave myself a DUI today.* by suspend_disbelief|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/27mtvo/i_gave_myself_a_dui_today/ci2bkjn)|.It sure feels nice to be able to drive anywhere and not have to worry if I'm still drunk from the night before etc....  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|13|0|sadtastic|*Fuck my stupid wife she wants to cut me out fine but I'm gonna be sober this weekend.* by formerlydrinkyguy77|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/282n2s/fuck_my_stupid_wife_she_wants_to_cut_me_out_fine/ci6ucao)|.I don't think it's appropriate to dismiss the field of psychology because OP's wife is studying it and he's having problems with her....  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|12|1|sober_girl|*Fuck my stupid wife she wants to cut me out fine but I'm gonna be sober this weekend.* by formerlydrinkyguy77|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/282n2s/fuck_my_stupid_wife_she_wants_to_cut_me_out_fine/ci6sgel)|.Seems like she used your secret drinking as an excuse to do what she wants.
