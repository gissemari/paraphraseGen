So it's been a while friends and I've been meaning to post something for the past month or so but didn't know what to say...My *first* sobriety date is looming in my calendar like a dark reminder that [it hasn't been smooth sailing](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2whkpv/665_days_back_at_day_1/) for me. Honestly the calendar is a little triggering for me because it's kind of a reminder that at any time I can fuck up and turn back into that 25 year old asshole I never ever want to be again. I delete it because I don't want to forget that first time and why I started this in the first place even though maybe I should get rid of it. All that being said and as I reflected on in my [300(ish) day check in](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3wttid/300_day_ish_checkin/) I am 665+695 days sober today. ..The most important thing I think about is vigilance. It's always when my sneaky brain convinces me that "I'm ok now!" that I begin to really struggle. But I find that empathy for myself is what really gets me through. Being kind to myself is what helps me make it through the guilt and shame. I finally feel like I'm at a place where I don't give a fuck about what anyone thinks of me or my journey or how I stay happy and healthy. So instead I want to focus on the days I didn't drink not the mistakes I've made along the way. So that today I can be sure that **I will not drink**...I am vigilant I am healthy I am happy. Thank you /r/stopdrinking for always being there even when I'm not here. &lt;3

I've been feeling so strong in my sobriety lately. I go to 2 or 3 AA meetings a week work with a sponsor and a psychiatrist and I stay busy. But your post is a great reminder not to get too comfortable and complacent. Even though I've passed the year mark I will never  make it  to any end point. Sobriety is something we must fight for everyday. I appreciate your post and I will not drink with you today.
&gt; So instead I want to focus on the days I didn't drink not the mistakes I've made along the way...I make so many fewer mistakes these days compared to when I was drinking. It was good to be reminded to take a moment to consider the last time I messed up^1.......^1 It was just last night but what could have turned into a multiple day disagreement/stand-off with my SO was resolved within an hour. I'm counting the rapid correction as a win :-)
