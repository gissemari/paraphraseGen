I'm working on day two today. Yesterday was easier today reality hit. At 5 am and I'm not a morning person...A few months back I told everyone I'm taking the month off drinking! (I've been trying to do that all year.) A week in I was feeling bored and decided to go out for a drink...I took many drinks. Two days later no job. Two months later no job no money. Isolated. Miserable and crying every day multiple times...I'm just mad at myself for going out that night. I had a week and it was a good start! I wanted to do a "month" but deep down I was hoping telling myself a month would give me enough clarity to continue...Anyway I'm just not drinking today. Still crying though. Oh well.

Each step forward is progress...Making the rate of progress you prefer?
