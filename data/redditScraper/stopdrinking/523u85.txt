I drank a lot for a long time. Maybe 12 years...at least 8 beers a night sometimes 16...just depended. I maybe went 7 nights total in that time without drinking in various attempts at quitting. ..My health was complete shit mentally and physically my relationship was in the dumper. I finally went to the doctor and got Librium to detox for a week and quit. I've been sober 2 months now... My relationship is a million times better I have way less anxiety and I feel my health is slowly improving. I've been in the gym 6 days a week. My cardio days are easier my weight is progressing on lifting days. I still don't feel great but I did a lot of damage to myself and it will take time to heal. I'm still smoking but am quitting today. Quitting those fuckers is a challenge...I wish I could say it was hard. That it was a struggle or challenging to quit but it hasn't been. The only hard part for me was finally just doing it...after about a week I just stopped thinking about drinking. The thought now of drinking a beer literally makes me nauseous. I'm just thankful and relieved it's all over and I'll never drink again...I don't really come here much. I didn't need a support network or AA self help books etc. I thought I would and this place gave me a great launching point. Stories that motivated me to quit...Just thought I'd pop in and add to the it can be done pile. Good luck to you all.
