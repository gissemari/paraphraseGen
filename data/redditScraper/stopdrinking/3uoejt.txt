Well I have almost gone 3 weeks and have nailed several situations without issue i.e. Thanksgiving bday party jamming music with friends and a football party. All of these events I would have been drinking my wine happily and thoroughly. I have had a few nights (including tonight) that have been plain rough. My worst nights are the ones that I really just want to have a glass of wine to relax. It surprises me honestly that my most mellow situations are the nights I'm craving alcohol. The idea of never drinking again is overwhelming to me.

Congrats one the 19 days!! The slower times were the hardest for me too. When I was really busy I didn't have time to think about it. Slow relaxing nights would drive me crazy. I'm a musician too so I would spend time practicing and learning new songs. Hours would pass by in the blink of an eye and I would be okay afterwards.  That got me through so many cravings. One thing for sure my playing is so much better sober. .It really is one day at a time and you can do today. 
Totally relate to this. I guess just get through each day focusing on not drinking TODAY is the answer. It worked for me in the past. "Never" is too much to cope with but one day we can manage. 
I agree "never again" is too daunting. I will not drink today seems much more manageable. Think of how far you've come and keep up the momentum! 
It is okay to feel overwhelmed about forever. That is why so many people work their recovery one day at a time. I am at a point in my recovery where I actively see all of the benefits of sobriety and want no part of drinking. But even then if I'm having a bad day I still feel my feelings and experience life one day at a time. Sometimes one moment at a time if a day is too long.
