I was offering some advice in the [IRC Channel](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/stopdrinking/) and a few of them asked me to post here for future reference. So feel free to comment and add lessons you've learned or heard about that newcomers can find useful:  .  .1. Focus on keeping sobriety just for today like 24 hours at a time... Don't think about tomorrow saturday or any other day. keep the focus on today. This will change with time but early in sobriety its kind of important to keep your sobriety manageable.  .  .2. Keep sweets readily available or at the very least flavored gum. The body wants alcohol alcohol breaks down to sugars in the body... So we can trick our body by consuming sugary things when we are thinking of drinking. Eat a snickers before drinking! We can deal with the other bad health habits later in sobriety.  .  .3. When ever there is an urge to drink post on r/stopdrinking come in here or go to a sobriety meeting (AA/SMART/LifeRing/etc) and tell on self and why we are wanting to drink. Talking out loud about why we want to drink to another problem drinker usually snaps us out of that thought process.  .  .4. Be kind to our self. Stopping drinking is incredibly difficult we have ingrained it into our daily life. So seeing how much alcohol was centered in our lives makes us bitter and resentful that the world is filled with alcohol and we can't do it. Just keep remembering I got through the past 8 hours sober I can do another 8. Pat self on the back for the time accomplished. In the event we slip whatever. Learn the lesson and move on. We had x time before we know sobriety is possible and we've done it before. Stay positive.  .  .5. About that positivity thing... Reframe everything said into a positive affirmation about self. I don't **HAVE** to do anything I **GET** to do things. I can do things to rescue and revive my life as a sober individual. There are thousands of people fighting this drinking problem I can do it with them. Together we can.  .  .6. Set aside difficult life questions. Set aside politics. Set aside career decisions. Set aside relationship issues. Focus on staying sober for the next 24 hours. Everything else is side noise. I need to focus on me right now not this other fluff. I can do this!  .  .7. This is a lesson I learned in the nick of time: Stay alive. If the question ever arises: Should I drink or should I off myself always choose to drink. Like I give no fucks how many times people relapse. I'd rather see a chronic relapser for 3 years than see someone with 3 years kill themselves cuz they can't stay sober.  .  .8. There is no shame in relapse staying sober mental issues whatever the fuck. We have a problem with alcohol. Any fucking day sober for a person like me is a fucking amazing day. Cherish and be grateful for every day sober. Be grateful for every day you have fighting the drinking problem. Do anything and everything possible to stay sober. If someone says eating a jalapeno a day helps keep them sober and it hasn't been tried yet... give it a try. (I don't know that anyone has said that but you know just a thought)  .  .9. In the event of a relapse write on paper the events that lead up to when we drank. Remove the emotion from it. State the simple facts. Woke up. Got fired. Girlfriend left me. Mom has cancer. Friend OD'd. Then review the feelings of each thing. Write out a plan of action for when something similar happens with a plan to stay sober. If no plan search r/stopdrinking for the fact(s) written down. Someone else has probably experienced that and made it through sober. Search out and find them.  .  .10. Boredom is not a feeling. Boredom is a choice. If we want to have fun in sobriety do things that are fun. Act like a child paint draw run around crazy be active in sobriety. If we are challenged early on in sobriety to do things do what is simple: clean the shit out of our living abode. Scrub it organize it reorganize it stay active in doing positive things and eventually the positive way will be a way of life.  .  .I edited this to conform to the 'speak from the I' as best I could. These are things I practice and what I have found useful. Let's take another 24 hours sober together!

This is great! 
Fantastic. I agree with every single point 
I totally agree with all of this.  Thank you for sharing and confirming.
Spot on 
Awesome list thank you for sharing this :)
Excellent thank you...&gt; If someone says eating a jalapeno a day helps keep them sober and it hasn't been tried yet... give it a try. (I don't know that anyone has said that but you know just a thought) ..lol! during my longest stretch of sobriety (4 plus years) I would eat raw habaneros for the endorphin rush... was that cheating?
Excellent. Thank you!
Saving this one for any hard days I may have in the future. Thanks for your insight from so far down the road!
Agree with all of this but #6 really resonates with me. Everything other than staying sober is fluff. 
Marvelous! I just copied and emailed this list to myself. 7 and 8 were quite moving for me. Thanks :)
Excellent List!  ..And 5-Stars on #10.  Especially the first few weeks/weekends I went on a cleaning rampage.  I remember feeling so silly when I'd continue to open a closet or drawers just to see how nice they looked!  For me staying busy knowing 'the urge' would pass if I was distracted was essential.
I like it when I see other people here using "fuck" as an expletive. Since I;m hyper aware of everything I do now cursing is something I really have to bite my tongue doing. Mostly social situations where I'm not exactly part of the 'in' crowd. Fuck man it's hard.
Wow...thanks for the reminder on what's important. 
This is great! Thank you so much 
These are very useful recommendations. I'm going to save this post for when I need it. Thank you for coming back to this sub after all this time sober. There are people like me here who need your wisdom. 
Act like an animal! 
Great post. Saved for future reference. Thanks for taking the time to write it all out. 
Good post. I'm going to try the Snickers thing.
