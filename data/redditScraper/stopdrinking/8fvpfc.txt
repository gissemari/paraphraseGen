I have to get my badge reset to today. I relapsed yesterday. It wasn't even worth it. I feel awful. Absolutely rotten and sick and anxious and ashamed of myself and scared. I can't do moderation. I don't want to die from drinking. I don't want to live like this. I'm so sad.

You acknowledged it.   Tomorrow start again.  You can do it. 
Yeah it's never worth it. Hang in there you'll fell better tomorrow. 
If it hadn't stopped being worth it very few of us would have stopped.  It's a vital lesson
Welcome back~ It's ok.  I've had a number of badge resets myself.  You have 21 days of success making an adjustment in your world.  It's a process.  IWNDWYT
This is literally the most disgusting feeling imaginable. I do not ever want a hangover again. Ever ever ever. Revolting. I feel like I'm dying.
Pick yourself up &amp; try again. You can do this. .IWNDWYT 
Hey I was feeling like that a few days ago. It's soo rough. Trying to remember that feeling is helping me stay away. Feel better!!
Those hangovers are awful. Just take care of yourself today. Be kind to yourself. 
It's ok. You made a mistake but you're picking yourself up again. I know the shame and horror. But try your best not to get into that unnecessary cruelty to yourself. You have a disease and are learning how to manage it. These hiccups are part of the process. No one is perfect which is totally as it should be. These feelings you're having are like a storm blowing through; they will undeniably pass. Hold on to that idea. It'll be ok.
Sorry to hear that. Thanks for sharing and reminding us all. Glad your back and try not to be too hard on yourself.
