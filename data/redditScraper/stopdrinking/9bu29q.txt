I went to a  Little Red Book' AA meeting yesterday. The  LRB' goes through each of the twelve steps and talks about them in more detail. We read the chapter on Step 4 which dealt with fear anger and our own blind spots...I appreciated that it talks about how fear &amp; anger are natural emotions which are appropriate and can serve a purpose in certain circumstances. I've run into problems in my life from trying to suppress &amp; ignore my feelings. Also my experience has been that people who've told me to suppress them have never been acting in my best interest they pretty much just wanted me to put up with other people's shit so I'd put up with their shit. So I'm leery of anything in recovery which suggests that certain emotions are  bad.  Every emotion serves a purpose that's why we have them. There's just healthy &amp; unhealthy ways to handle them...With regards to the  blind spots  section of the reading someone in the meeting told a story about how after a decent chunk of time sober she'd realized that she'd interpreted a large event from her teen years incorrectly and it was something that she should've included on her fourth step. When she told her sponsor their response was that sometimes we have blind spots about things that we aren't ready to deal with yet which isn't necessarily a bad thing because confronting them before we're ready could challenge our recovery...That struck home for me. A couple of days ago u/sclertons linked to a [comment of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/32f2n1/comment/cqapsg1/?st=JLFAWDHC&amp;sh=9b8fb1ce) in SD from three years ago where I'm pontificating at length like I know what I'm talking about. (Yeah I've been acting like I own the place off &amp; on for roughly 4.5 years. Before u/ginger_sprout I had some other handle which I deleted after I stomped off in a huff when someone on SD u/offtherock maybe? suggested that I didn't have to cook with wine. Of *course* I had to cook with wine. I had to relapse *somehow.*)(For the record whoever they were they were right - there are *loads* of excellent cooking substitutes. Not cooking with wine has actually made me a better cook because now I think more about what I'm doing and why. But I digress.)..Anyway in that comment I did have some nice things to say about practicing acceptance but I also basically said that I didn't see the point in working through the reasons why I drank and I wasn't going to do so. Looking at my family tree I've got a genetic predisposition for alcoholism coming from both sides. But a big part of why drinking felt so right to me was that it helped me cope with the effects of  developmental trauma  (abuse &amp; neglect growing up as well as general chaos and stress in my home environment.) Not addressing my developmental trauma has allowed it to come back &amp; bite me in the ass in various ways throughout my adulthood. ..I'm dealing with it now and am satisfied that I'm making progress and doing the work that I need to do to move on from it &amp; fill in my missing gaps. But it's still little hard to see that statement from three years ago where I'm just point-blank refusing to engage with it. So it was helpful for me to hear that comment. I really probably wasn't at a place where I was able to deal with it back then. It's been a lot to confront. And all I can do is focus on where I am now &amp; look at how I want to proceed moving forward. I can't go back and change that. (Which is kinda what my comment three years ago was also about. So I wasn't *entirely* off the mark.)..Anyway that's me for today. I hope that life finds you all well. May your emotional range be full &amp; your blind spots small...Ginger\_Sprout Out

Your honesty and willingness to explore the root causes of why you drank are inspiring! Thank you for sharing. IWNDWYT.
Great Share !  Thank you!
   !  Have a good one out there sprout healing and fun sober times seem to be coming your way in their happy glory!    
I like the sound of that LRB meeting!..Glad to see you're doing so well :)..
You are so insightful Sprout! Here is a link to an interesting article about the ACE (adverse childhood experience) study. "The ACE Study found that the higher someone's ACE score   the more types of childhood adversity a person experienced   the higher their risk of chronic disease mental illness violence being a victim of violence and a bunch of other consequences. The study found that most people (64%) have at least one ACE; 12% of the population has an ACE score of 4. Having an ACE score of 4 nearly doubles the risk of heart disease and cancer. It increases the likelihood of becoming an alcoholic by 700 percent and the risk of attempted suicide by 1200 percent. The MD featured states "Addiction shouldn't be called  addiction . It should be called  ritualized compulsive comfort-seeking . This seems to fit the fact that activities and sensations can be as addictive as substances.  .https://acestoohigh.com/2017/05/02/addiction-doc-says-stop-chasing-the-drug-focus-on-aces-people-can-recover/.It may still be that there is a genetic component but it appears that it is not simple and certainly not a single gene  especially since it has been found that gene expression is environmentally influenced.  And yeah none of us can go back and change it.  So important for all of us to be gentle with ourselves (and others) but that is not something many of us have learned.  IWNDWYT
