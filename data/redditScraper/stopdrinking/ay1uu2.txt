Things are better sober than before when drinking. But things are far from perfect. Money is saved mind skin physical appearance energy motivation attitude and emotional control are all improved.  I am very thankful for all the support here on SD and I hope to inspire others who are struggling: You can do this. Start small but commit to believing in yourself that you CAN be a different better person without alcohol. Sorry this post is drab but it is sincere (I just don't have a lot of time due to work deadline). Love y'all!

Congrats on Triple-Digit day.  Be proud because it really is a big milestone!  But know this:  You are NOT "Cured"!  I say this because milestones tend to bring out the lizard brain who lies and says "Surely you can stop at *just one* now."  Don't fall for it!!  Keep up the good work!  
Yay! Congratulations.
Congratulations. IWNDWYT
Congrats!!!!
