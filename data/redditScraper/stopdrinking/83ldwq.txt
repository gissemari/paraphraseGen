Today has been a very off day for me. I've been suffering some pretty bad insomnia maybe getting just a few hours a night if I am lucky. No hobby I'm a workaholic and not is really much fun anymore. I try to keep up hope and try to keep upbeat 8 months in...but I am in a rut with life right now...I went to a meeting earlier and I typically take notes. I was completely checked out. I even wrote "I am distracted today" and "I feel a lazy relapse coming on."..I'm not sure what is going on but any old timer or newbie advice suggestions or some common hope may help.

Hambino - are you doing any service work? Volunteering? 
My rehab counsellor told me that when you begin to feel this way it's a sign that what's you're doing for your sobriety needs to change up.  people hit a wall so to speak on their sober journey.  It is so good that you recognize it!  Many people don't.  Do you have any wishes hopes &amp; dreams for starting a hobby or something like that?  Any interests you've had that you think you'd like to pursue?  Must you work all those long hours is it necessary?  Could you plan a little holiday to somewhere now that you've saved money by not drinking?  How about if you like dogs going to the local animal shelter and walking the dogs that are up for adoption?  Is there a book you've always wanted to read that you never had time for?  Feeding your senses too if helpful.  Sight sound smell hearing touch.  I know it's tough.  Keeping your eyes on the prize is critical.  IWNDWYT.
