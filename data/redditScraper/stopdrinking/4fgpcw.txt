In my dream I just had one beer felt so stupid and didn't even enjoy it it was a hot summer day at a barbecue. I'm happy it was only a dream and it's a warning I'm going to take very seriously. .I'm happy that I remember dreaming maybe my first night of good sleep in 109 days. I believe although it was a relapse dream it might mean I'm making progress.

I had one night two or three of my recovery. I woke up in such a panic and full of shame.  For me it helped me see how much I did want to be sober because boy was I happy (and so relieved!) when I realized it was just a (very cruel) dream. ..Keep on keepin' on my friend. I will not drink with you today!
