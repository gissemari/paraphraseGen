It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-----------------------------------------..**Struggle:** Recently as a freelancer editor I sent an invoice to a woman for work I'd done (and that she'd been very happy with). I sent the invoice several times and my client kept saying  I'm putting the check in the mail today  but it never arrived. Finally when I asked her where my payment was she said  I'm feeling conflicted about paying this bill.  Gah! Now I have to go through the tiresome process of taking her to small claims court...**Triumph:** Over my lifetime I've had to take about seven different people to court for a variety of reasons and I have won every case. I am not very assertive so it really helps to have a judge **order** someone to do what they promised they'd do...**General:** I have been reading Sherman Alexie's brilliant memoir *You Don't Have to Say You Love Me.* Alexie is a Native American a beautiful poet and an alcoholic who is now sober. In his memoir he writes about having brain surgery a chapter of the book I paid special attention to since I had gamma knife surgery on a brain tumor just a few months ago...After Alexie's surgery his nurse told him that while he was recovering from the anesthesia  You were flirting with everybody. Calling everybody beautiful and hot. You were flirting with the men and the women. I think you flirted with yourself and with the MRI machine too.  My first thought was oh dear. I hope that's not how I acted when I was under anesthetic because it totally sounds like me. (I wasn't an angry drunk I was an  I love you  kind of drunk.).
----------immediate responses--------

Yuck sorry to hear about your issues getting paid /u/sfgirlmary. Sounds like you're getting it sorted out in court which is satisfying!..Struggle - Work is hard. There's a lot of it. Overall I enjoy it and it is very fulfilling but sometimes it feels not worth it. Enough said...Triumph - The orchestra I play in had a concert tonight and we sounded awesome. I'm excited to listen to the recording...General - I've noticed during my sober streaks that the typical existential crises/spells of anxiety that I used to regularly get while drinking are calmed way down. Go figure. Things still bubble up but it's much easier to deal with them with my head on straight rather than slamming a drink. I guess this should be obvious but I need to type it here to remind myself (because the voice still tends to get overpowering sometimes otherwise my badge would read ~50 days by now)
Struggle: Holiday season at work is always stressful and hectic and we're on our toes all day to make sure clients are happy. Doing this while still wondering about the future of our employment (my department at our store shuts down sometime next year... But we don't know if it's sooner or later) has put a damper on any sort of relaxation around the next few weeks leading into the new year!..Triumph: in my sobriety I rekindled my love for volleyball. I have worked very hard to become a better player these past couple of months than I have been in the 4 years since I started playing while drinking. This has culminated in a season high finish for my team tonight as we move into playoffs at our highest ranking of the year. I also played one of my strongest games to date. And I am pleased to keep getting better and grow stronger. Not drinking has been pivotal to that success! (not bad for an old fart of 43yrs)..General Musings: I had the pleasure to catch up with a former co-worker who is also sober (11yrs). Today we talked about our journey to sober living. 2 take aways really stuck out for me from our talk: 1. Whether you're 25 or 85 our addiction stories and our reasons to fall so hard and get back up are usually similar shared human moments. And 2. The biggest obstacle to finally accepting sobriety as a lifelong pursuit is fear. Fear of missing out. We condition ourselves to think a life can not be lived without some semblance of drinking. But when measured... there is more to life to do without a drink than there is with one...Thanks for your patience with the long post!
**Struggle:** TL;DR: My closest friend is in deep trouble and I may be the one to call him out. - I ve been on a sick leave for two years now and although everything is complicated it turns out that my closest friend who is also my boss is destroying everyone and everything around him. I m one of the lucky ones since we re so close but others are really suffering under his temper whims and cynicism and they don t dare to report it. After I was burnt out helping him achieve his visions he hasn t approached me once in two years as a friend and only the mandatory number of times through work (4/year). I thought he was ashamed but was shocked to slowly realize that he purposefully neglects all promises and legal duties to me by squeezing me out even withholding my role in building this project. We re in financial distress over this I ve had a major personal blow (self esteem and all that and this is where my drinking escalated again) but worst of all I don t know if I ll ever be able to work full time again. So I m in a numbing dilemma. He might lose everything and that might be disastrous to his family who are also close to my wife and kids. But I *have* lost everything and several other people are heading fast towards disaster and I truly believe that right should be done. I have to handle this but I don t know how...**Triumph:** The Saints had a wonderful weekend far out in the woods without phones tv or any other distractions just eachother...**General:** I was a loving drunk too. I m pleased though to see that I haven t lost *all* that love going sober. I m pretty emotional for a woodsman and some times joy and good will bubbles through making me behave like an awkward school girl in love. I like that in a man.
Struggle: it's summer now and the drinking is beginning. I feel jealous of those drinking a beer in the sun that they can do that without getting drunk. Oh well life isn't fair...Triumph: i got a promotion - more money and well more responsibility but i think i can handle it with my new sober mind. Most things are a lot easier to handle now...General: i'm sick and have a cough that wont go away. Bed feels so nice right now...Peace    IWNDWYT
**Struggle:*** getting back into the gym after a 2+ month hiatus is hard. Its just a mental barrier but damn. Come on!!..**Triumph:** met some cool people at a meeting last night not an AA meet it was a coaching circle tupe thing...**General:** feeling good. Just want to get back to the gym.
Hey everyone..Struggle:.I crashed my bicycle and now I'm in the hospital waiting for an X-ray on my knee and a scan on my brain. ..Triumph:.My helmet almost split in two. 100% saved my life. Please please please wear a helmet when riding a bicycle. ..General:.I found out this week that orange juice contains approximately .0125% alcohol. Not sure why it stuck with me but it did. 
I can very much relate to the invoice chasing /u/sfgirlmary - I hope you succeed. I'm having to shake a couple of clients at the moment heading into end of year closedown. it sucks! Proud of you for going the distance t get the right result... I just end up writing things off. ..*Victory* getting that university place offer to finally doa  degree in something I am passionate about is a huge victory for me and the result of a bunch of smaller ones each step of the way from going through the legal process to get daughter's trust funds in safe hands so her education is covered to wading through the feelings of shame that came with having to explain to various bodies why I am missing some paperwork and then going through the work-around process [just to get the required transcripts for my brief stint at uni in my early 20s required me to supply scans of a change of name certificate birth certificate drivers license marriage certificate AND divorce certificate along with lengthy conversation and a fee!] But I stuck with it and I am now really excited about this whole new path opening up for me next year. I could ONLy have achieved this sober...*struggle* the silly season is going to be full of temptation and no doubt the Lizard Voice will pipe up a lot [it has already started]. So I'm stocking up on NA drink treats and books [the complete works of Jane Austen Aldo Leopold's Sand County Almanac and Michelle Obama's memoir are among the goodies I have prepared for myself]. I WANT that one year smiley star - and I also want to know I can do this thing and stay sober through the Xmas and New Year period - and beyond :)..*general* really happy I got to my yoga class tonight. It's the first regular night time kid-free activity I've signed myself up for since Kiddo was born in 2007. She's old enough now to be left at home for an hour or so on her own and I am so chuffed to be doing something so positive for my wellbeing..
Oh man I needed this today. ..**Struggle:** I quit my job. Just now. *Why*. God. It wasn't working and was causing way more stress than I can handle so it's probably the right call but I'm abandoning things left right and center...and wondering if just because I'm being sober I need somewhere else to channel my self-destructiveness. Argh. Tomorrow is therapy so I'll hopefully go into that. But there goes my financial independence I guess? That hit of "relief" I got from the act of quitting though god.  ..**Triumph:** No idea. Immediately messaging my therapist I guess. and not hiding it from her. Sobriety always a good triumph for me this early on. Literally feel like all my energies are going towards sobriety so no room for anything else. No energy. But I'm also going to go to the next AA meeting as soon as I can. ..**General:** Shifting houses in a couple of days. It's been such a bad few months. 
struggle: i dont know how to make my sober streaks into a full sobriety it doesnt help that my partner of 10 years drinks everyday. i struggle with myself and i struggle with our relationship seems sometimes that it would be impossible to be a sober person while in a relationship with someone that drinks a lot. ..&amp;#x200B;..triumph: im realizing i need help in my relationship and ready to bring up couples therapy to him tonight (its taken me a full year to accept this so yay on not being in denial)..&amp;#x200B;..general: many have said it before but its amazing how different anxiety feels with a sober mind it is still horrible but it feels like manageable somehow (as opposed to overwhelming and suicidal thoughts i get while im drinking) just a general thought and hopefully something that i can remind myself of when someone offers me a drink and im struggling to say no. ..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;
u/sfgirlmary Sorry you have to go to the extra trouble to collect what is owed you. That you are going to go for it speaks well for your recovery!  I felt every emotion possible and cried through Alexie's book which dissects the impact of culture racism sheer talent love longing . . . ..As for me . . . ..**Struggle:** I'm really noticing the darkness of the days I'm not enthusiastic about any holiday activities especially another long drive. ..**Triumph:**  I'm showing up. ..**General:** I love my SO deeply but would also love to have three days just to myself. Three days without a voice asking for my attention or effort.  And IWNDWYT ..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;
I'm a night drinker after 9pm I would have my 10 beers and pass out till work the next morning. This day 3 for me and the last 2 nights I've felt sad like I was missing out on something I don't understand why I fee this way.  
Struggle:  I have struggled with my work project the last two days particularly yesterday. It has its ups and downs. The downs suck. ...Triumph:  out of the blue yesterday evening my brother called and offered encouragement. He lives in another state and had no way of knowing I'd been having a couple bad days. And I'd been feeling sorry for myself lately thinking nobody understands etc. The phone call totally reversed my mood and outlook for the day. ...General:  I have read some of Sherman Alexis's work and keep meaning to read more. 
Struggle :  Getting to the gym.  ..Triumph:  I'm sober.  I'm sober.  I'm sober. ..General: I have a date today and I plan to do some shopping.  
**Struggle** Work as usual. I spent a lot of time here over the weekend so my ducks would be in a row for the first business day of the month project I have to do (and have submitted to international by the end of the 3rd business day of the month or there is a $500 a day fine and you are in the doghouse big time) and then our CFO sat on my worksheets that he insists on reviewing before I finalize. Now today he wants to talk about them and have me do a bunch more stuff on them etc etc so it's going to be a long long day. I can't do any December stuff until I've closed out Nov and I have people bitching at me about that. And I can feel my BP is up I had chest pains yesterday and I'm so stressed. Why? I care about my job and I need my job but it is NOT the end of the world if this deadline isn't met or even if I get fired. I told myself that over and over and over yesterday and tried to soothe myself but couldn't seem to really calm down. Maybe I need to start meditating. I'm doing a lot of yoga lately but I guess that's not enough. ..**Triumph** I don't have a big win so I'll go with something silly. We're about 3 turkey sandwiches away from the end of the Thanksgiving leftovers at my house. ..**General** Looking forward to getting into some Xmas baking this weekend.
**S:** Diet like what the f*** am I supposed to eat?  Don't eat this don't eat that no gmo's organic free range grass fed no anti-biotics.  I just go full on screw it and start subsisting on trail mix and coffee in addition to an occasional frozen pizza and hot dog.  At least I've cut down on the ice cream because the puppy sleeps in the kitchen and I don't want to disturb her to get ice cream. ..**T:**  Along with alcohol I think I have a genetic predisposition to being late.  I've been working hard to overcome this character defect.  I dropped my daughter off to school early!!  Major victory...**G:**  When my mother drank she was usually fine.  It was when she wasn't drinking that her mood was very unstable.  When I was younger it was when my parents went out to the bar that I could actually relax a little bit because I wasn't waiting for the hammer to drop out of the blue.
**Struggle:**  Work is insane and we really need to hire more folks.  And I need a job that covers health insurance instead of me paying almost $600/mo for something decent. ..**Triumph:**  I can afford a $600/month health insurance despite it making things tight.  It'll mean I need to stick to my budget and that's a goal I already have so this may be a good thing in the long run...**General:**  Welp looks like Sherman Alexie is going on my reading list!
Struggle: I have felt a bit 'off' today. I feel really tired. I probably slept for around 10 hours per evening this weekend and then around 6 hours each week night since Monday. I have found myself having thoughts that I think could be the normalising of wanting to drink again. I don't plan on doing it but I am just a bit wary.  ..Triumph: I am glad that I am posting here and recognising that I am at risk of drinking again and trying to do something about it...General: I love this sub and all the positivity that comes with it. 
**Struggle**: Keeping motivation up at work. Right now I'm in this weird in-between period. I have things I need to get done just not the motivation to do it. Winter really can bring me down and I'm getting back into the regular swing of working out. Now I need to also get my diet back on track...**Triumph**: It sounds like my wife may actually find some full-time work in her field as a professor! It's a temporary residence but it'll pay OK and provide benefits for us. That's great because I'm self-employed and man health care is expensive. I'm of course also very excited for her...so soon after finishing her dissertation too. We were beginning to think she may have to go into another line of work...**General**: I'm on day 3 and not for the first time. I think this time around I'm trying to be more aware of my thoughts and feelings. Being more self-reflective and reading/listening to other's stories has eased the anger I feel every time I try to quit. I know it's just in my head but be conscious of my thoughts and feeling and really paying attention to them is helping.
Struggle: I've been overweight since I started Freshman year of college (now in year four) and I've been struggling to start exercising. More specifically I've been struggling to motivate myself to get up and go workout. I have been trying to eat better though by eating more home cooked meals instead of eating out...Triumph: I started a court ordered substance abuse program in relation to a DWI I received earlier this year. Even though it's court ordered I'm very much looking forward to learning from it and heading into it with an open mind. ..General: I've really been at peace since I've been tackling sobriety and I feel like everything seems much easier to accomplish! ..IWNDWYT!

Struggle: Getting any work done whatsoever. Depression has been kicking my ass and killing my motivation...Triumph: I finally told my ex to stop contacting me. I should have said it weeks ago. I thought I would be sad but honestly it's just a relief...General: I've already done half the holiday shopping which is an improvement from my past history of shopping on Christmas Eve. I feel more prepared and equipped to face the holidays.
Struggle - I'm halfway through my double shift and I am feeling very tired. Have four hours to go and it feels a long way away right now...Triumph: Managed to up my weights at the gym today and it was my tenth session since I started going regularly again on the 12th November - so ten sessions in less than a month!..General: I'm almost finished reading The One Thing by Gary Keller and would recommend it for anyone struggling with focus or productivity levels! .
Struggle: I was supposed to get 10k from my former employer this week but turns out someone didn't do their job so my money will only come mid-Jan.  Also my son caught a bad virus from preschool and now I'm sick too...Triumph: I've committed to do yoga everyday this month and have stuck to it so far. 5/5 days and I am so proud of myself. ..General: Today after work I was craving a drink and that made me realise that I really am an addict. I persevered with the support of this thread and window shopping. I will not drink with you today! 
It's early days on my lucky seventh quit of the year and I've been so open with so many people this time around. I'd always say I'm on a break or cutting back or on medication but now I'm just being frank and saying I'm not drinking anymore. It stopped being fun and it's too hard to moderate. I said this to a coworker during a casual conversation today when he asked what my favorite local beers are. It felt great and we moved right along. ..So here's to not drinking loud and proud! We got this!
Struggle: motivation at work. It's been a good year for me but the sheer volume of what I need to do before Feb 4 is overwhelming to me. Deep breaths. ..Triumph: I'm on the mend after having a nasty respiratory virus for more than a week. I took only one day off; should have taken more but see struggle above. ..General: I got two kittens post-hurricane Florence and they make me incredibly happy. :)
Today is day 3 for me. I struggled with a board games night at a friend's place last night. My partner brought a bottle of wine and everyone else was also drinking. I felt awkward and anxious all evening made worse when I knocked over a glass of water (thankfully the board game was okay). I wish I hadn't gone at all. I thought getting out of the house and seeing friends would help but I didn't know most of the people very well.   ..At least today there was a triumph: I'm doing some upgrading courses and went into my distance education's physical location to write my first test since I've started this upgrading journey. Not sure how I did yet but the fact that I got that first test out of the way feels good.
Triumph: I just keep trying. And going.
**Struggle:** I'm moving into a new place in between jobs eating unhealthy food and today I put $80 into a poker machine. I gambled away $80 that I shouldn't have I understand even without alcohol my addictive personality exists in my diet apathy and now a random desire to gamble I'm going to start watching myself a little more closely.  Bad weather is crippling my motivation to keep running gotta invest in some gloves and a ski mask  or teach my dog to run on a treadmill...&amp;#x200B;..**Triumph:** I'm still sober I've confirmed two decent paying freelance jobs to float me through the year and I' have a meeting with an old client on Friday about an opportunity he has for me.  I'm finally moving into a new home on Saturday after months of roommate troubles and organizing/purging my things. Lots of potential in these coming weeks I am excited for things to come.  I hit my 2018 yearly goal of 1000 miles here's to 2000 in 2019!..&amp;#x200B;..**General**:  ..Screw my vices. If it makes me feel worthless I need to stop. If I'm lying to people about how I spend my time then I need to stop. If it's bad for my body my brain or my spirit. I need to stop...Even after all these days of not drinking under my belt I still manage to have days where I feel like I've failed my willpower to some extent.  I am still worried about the future scared of the unknown and I fall into traps if my foundation isn't strong enough. ..&amp;#x200B;.. "My 'fear' is my substance and probably the best part of me." Franz Kafka  .
Struggle: work is very meh and the sport i train every day is feeling meh too (though not in a bad way; it happens every few weeks). plus things are a bit tight money-wise so i've been naturally making small but stupid/unnecessary purchases and then feeling guilty for it. ..Triumph: i haven't let any of this mess up my routines. i've been going to training consistently eating home-cooked meals and haven't felt like i wanted a drink...General: i've slowly made improvements to my life bit by bit and realised that if i'm still having bouts of depression then maybe i'll have to talk to someone. exercising regularly eating well not drinking or smoking all of these things can mitigate the symptoms and i definitely don't want to change any of my good habits but depression can be chemical or it can be something underlying that i can't see on my own.

**Struggle:**  I feel like I've run out of steam.  I don't want to start studying for my next exams I don't want to work on extracurricular craft projects I don't want to worry about Christmas.  I just feel tired and worn down.  ..**Triumph:** If my biggest problem is that I don't really feel like shopping for Christmas and finishing my sewing projects I'm freakin' kickin' ass...**General:**  The day was 9 hours long where I am and I worked 8 hours.  I guess I should take some Vitamin D.  Sigh.  Feels like winter..
Struggle: traveling for work disorganization of new company balancing work normal life and planning my wedding. ..Triumph: half of the big expenses have deposits down and I've chosen my dress. I found an awesome meeting where I've traveled to. Because of sobriety I'm much better at letting go of the reigns and letting things pan out the way they are supposed to and just ensuringmy part is taken care of. Everyone else's part is not mine to worry about. ..General: missing my kitties but thoroughly enjoying this new adventurous chapter in my life.
