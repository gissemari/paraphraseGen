I am struggling 191 days today and my wife says I'm making it look easy but it isn't I am struggling. Add to that I have adult children that are not dealing with their own issues and it's impacting our lives. I really want to step up and do the right thing but I am at a loss as to what to do next.

I am a few months farther along and just a couple days ago I had a conversation with my wife about how I had been coasting and it was easy for a while but nowadays the drinking demon is riding me hard.  She said that she was proud of me and didn't know I was struggling so much.  It was a relieving conversation and has reinforced the support I needed from her.  ..I don't know anything about you or your children but I am willing to bet that drinking would make whatever you need to step up and do much harder to accomplish.  Could a meaningful conversation with your wife get the two of you on the same page for your needed support and to address the issues with the kids?
I've been reading  Codependent No More' at the suggestion of a couple of people and it has been helpful for me in detaching myself in a loving way from other people's problems. And it's helping me prioritize taking care of myself. I never used to really understand self-care - I just drank to fix my feelings. ..I'm also working with a great therapist and getting support from AA meetings and my sponsor. I'm finding that the more support I get and the more I take care of my own needs the more I am able to be in life of people who I love in a meaningful way. I've gotten sober before without getting support or taking care of myself properly and I eventually cracked. I could say the right things and go through the motions but I wasn't addressing the underlying problems or making the changes that I needed to make to stay sober so I eventually reverted back to my old patterns...Not sure if that's helpful for your particular situation it's just what's been working for me.
