I take it one day at a time my friend. It's difficult but I don't waste time thinking about past or future relapses...One day. This day.
Living with a codependent is not an easy way to quit.   They will most likely trigger you too drink eventually.  Can you separate yourself from her so that you can work on your issues without her negative injection.. You are making a wise decision to not drink I'm proud and so is your son. .Iwndwyt
\&gt;  My son is so happy when I'm sober. ..Whew that's a powerful line there. I would re\-read that a lot of times if you're searching for direction. This sub is a great place but your son is your son and he recognizes the change when you don't drink and likes it. You said you started when you were 14 don't let your 15 year old son see that that's an ok way to live...I agree with others finding a way to separate from your spouse may be your best route on that front. You're right drinks and meds are a terrible combo. ..You can do this!
This is one of those rare instances when I feel comfortable telling a stranger on the internet that they need a divorce.
