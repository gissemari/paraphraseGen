I would get a week or two of not drinking under my belt but I would start getting discouraged by people I was letting down. They were still expecting me to screw up and would treat me like I was still drinking and I don't blame them. This discouragement made me think "Screw it!  If I'm going to be treated like a drunk I might as well be a drunk!"  My selfishness was a cycle and I couldn't break it.  Once people realized this was the real thing I started being treated better. This made it easier and easier to not drink.  ..If you're trying to stop don't stop stopping!  It's going to suck and people will still treat you like trash at first. Don't get mad at them you conditioned them to not trust you. You have to keep going and show them you are serious. It's going to take time maybe a lot of time to earn their trust back. You can do this!  Prove everyone wrong by changing.  Give them some time. Whatever you do don't let this discouragement lead you back in to the cycle of drinking. Good luck!  We're all here for you.

One other thing that sucks it that even though your close friends and family are 100% supportive they still don't get it. It's impossible to put yourself in the shoes of an addict if you're not one yourself. How often have I heard the ''All it takes is will power'' bullshit!?..keep trucking mate!
Yep. And some people are jealous- because you are moving forward and they aren't.  It's hard accepting the distrust but time does heal that 
Thanks for that ... I don't even know how many day 1's I have anymore .. but I keep coming back. I'm beginning to realize what causes my relapses but knowing and doing something about it is the difficult part.
