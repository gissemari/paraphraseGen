I am 5 days sober today. Doesn't seem like much but I fought for these 5 days and I'm so proud of them. I haven't been to a meeting yet (I am going to my first one on Saturday) and I'm still struggling with intense cravings headaches nausea etc. but the support and positivity I've received here is incredible and I'm so thankful. Having a place to talk about this struggle with no judgements and reading all your posts has made getting sober seem a lot less impossible than I thought. It also helped me feel less ashamed and open up to my family about my alcoholism bringing me even more support I never thought I'd have. Thank you all so much!
