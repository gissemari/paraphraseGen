I haven't gone more than 2-3 days without alcohol since I did a humanitarian trip to Guatemala in February 2013. That was 7 days without alcohol and I pretty much didn't have a choice -- it was a dry group...I did great the first day even went out with friends and ordered Cokes almost just to prove to myself that I could do it. Now however I'm scared. I *feel like* I have less resolve even though I don't. I skipped out on a girls' afternoon get together yesterday because I was afraid of the social situation. I have a date tonight that I'm strangely okay with probably because I'm pretty sure it's not going anywhere and I'm not emotionally invested -- it's likely our last date. I was invited to a party on Saturday which I'd *love* to go to but obviously there will be booze there. ..I'm scared that I'm going to start using my fear of social situations to feed the introvert which I've struggled so hard with over the last couple of years to overcome...On a positive note: I made it to 5 days and I'm not going to drink today.

I am not going to drink TODAY in solidarity with /u/redbunnies!
I wish I had some profound words of wisdom for you like some people would.  But all I can say is I am in exactly the same boat as you.  Day five by my choice.  I can only take one day at a time.  One situation at a time.  But get some people that will support and distract you.  They are in your life.

Early in sobriety sticking with dry people and dry places was extremely important to me.  I made the mistake of following through with the plan to host a deck party at my house in the first two weeks of my quit date.  (It had been booked a month ahead so I rationalized I couldn't cancel).  It nearly sunk me and was an unnecessary risk to my fragile sobriety..I survived but it was NOT a fun party for me.  No one could talk me out of it though.  I hope you don't put yourself through the same thing.  ..I'm also not going to drink today. I'm with ya buddy.
5 day checking in!  When you're at parties do a lot of winking and throw some double guns if you don't know what else to do..."Hi Redbunnies! Want a beer?".*wink*."Did you just wink at me?".*double guns*
All right!  Have you thought about connecting with other recovering people in your community for support?  It really helps.  There's AA SMART recovery- I'm sure plenty of others as well.  It's helped me a lot with the isolation and also this great sense of relief and belonging with others who have the same thinking that I do...Well done Bunnies!..
