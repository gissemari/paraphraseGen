Struggling with the holiday boredom and loneliness almost gave in but so relieved I pulled it together at the last minute...I had some nice Q tonic water in the fridge that I like to drink plain. At the grocery store I decided to buy a bottle of gin which I've never had before in my life. I have nothing to do for weeks and felt like I might as well try a new drink. Stupid but whatever. ..Anyway poured myself a drink at home and immediately realized I didn't want this. I want a clear and stable mind and even one drink will throw that off. Tossed it all. Happy that I chose not to even at the last minute. Wasted $6 for some cheap gin but whatever...Thanks everyone and I will not drink with you all today.

That has to be one of the hardest things. I'm glad you were able to resist. It's just not worth it. IWNDWYT. 
You didn't miss much Gin is like Liquid Depression anyway!!..It's basically just a kind of mascara thinner.....Better to pour it straight down the toilet instead of filtering it through your liver first!..Well done for staying strong and if you're lonely I hear the IRC chat in the sidebar is good.....I won't drink with you today!..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
I'm really proud of you. I know how hard that shit is
Nice save!     
Great job on choosing yourself over alcohol!
This. I know my tag doesn't say anything but I just reached double digits of no drinking myself for the first time in years. I've been reading things in this subreddit lurking for the past week and a half. I'm a bartender and it's so hard making these damn drinks for people all day long and then telling myself I don't need to be like them. Gin is a weakness of mine. When life got me down I would not only crave being drunk but the taste of gin. I think about it wayyyyy too much. I don't know if I would have had your strength but hearing your story makes me feel much more at ease. I know as long as we stay strong it will continue to get easier. I appreciate you sharing.

Best $6  wasted  you could have! Although I hardly call it a waste to make a good decision for yourself :) well done!
