First time back in awhile. After a gnarly relapse and a miserable year of binge drinking I'm excited! So much laughter and great people. Day 7 here I come!

Woo Hoo!
Welcome back  we saved you a chair.
Congrats!! You got this  
Glad you are back It's a journey we are have to travel to get to where we are going. It has good times bad times but  I try to learn from each situation good or bad see if I can do better the next time I encounter a impasse. .Progress not perfection.. 
We've been tactless impaired without you.  
I don't view relapse as a failure that hard won knowledge is just a new weapon in your arsenal to fight it this time. you can do this.
I have started going to AA daily too. Today's meeting was on the first step and was pretty timely for me. Admitting I have a problem is easy but figuring out how my life is unmanageable was tricky.  ..Anyway good luck and I will not drink with you today!
