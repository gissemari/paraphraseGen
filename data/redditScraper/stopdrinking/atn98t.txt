I was ack in my hometown for the week visiting friends and family. I went out with my old group of drinking buddies the other night and told everyone I wouldn't be drinking and it's because I have a problem. They were all really low key about it which was surprising. One of them even said "well I saw that coming!" It was just nice that they accepted it without any pressure. One of them even said that they should try and stop as well. I was worried about relapsing on this trip but I'm sitting in the airport having made it through without a drop. Today I'm proud of myself. ..I'm glad I found this place even though I mostly lurk. Thank you for continuing to post. Its motivation to keep going. IWNDWYT.

That's awesome!  A couple months back a drinking buddy of mine came through town and I had to explain I'm now sober.  It was _no big deal_ and we still had a great time catching up.  And the next day I actually _remembered_ the stories we'd exchanged!..IWNDWYT
