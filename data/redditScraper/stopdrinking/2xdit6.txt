*Because we freakin care!*..I have two original kids and four bonus kids.  I have seen three of them into adulthood one entering it now one in the midst of teen-hood and one bringing up the rear way too damn fast. Some of them have made some pretty dicey choices.  At some point all you can do as a parent is say  *This* is where I've been and what I've seen *this* is the predominate outcome please consider wisely what you're doing.   I've had to sit back and keep my mouth shut while I watched some of their decisions lead to disaster because **I know** some things have to be learned firsthand or at least not from the words of a parent. Nothing I say or do will save them from what I know is coming.  And yes once in a blue moon they manage to swoop out of the grasp of the inevitable and I am amazed and relieved beyond words.  And once in a SUPER blue moon one of them actually heeds the advice and continues on along safe paths. I may come off as doubting Thomas or that I am not supporting them but I never want one of them to come back from catastrophe and say  Why didn't you tell me?  or worse yet lose them and for the rest of my life ask myself  Why didn't I warn them? . .Moderation has been covered here pretty extensively it seems almost daily with many different opinions. I'm not re-hashing that.  I want people to understand why those that vehemently oppose moderation do sometimes gracefully sometimes poorly. But it's all comes from the same place. *We care.* We hope others can avoid the things we didn't. As a part of this active community we **want** each poster here to *succeed* in their own journey. For me it is difficult to read a post that romanticizes the ol' drinking days *though I've posted these myself.* It's hard seeing someone with a stretch of sobriety announce that they  got this  now and is confident in their ability to moderate *though I've posted these myself.* Some people were polite and gentle others not so much. It is part of the process but it's hard to watch someone else do it and type out  If you can make it work that's great  knowing what we know...I can't say I'll never drink again but I can say I won't drink today.  I can say if it does happen it's with full understanding that I am willfully jumping back in the fire and I can expect every bad thing that drove me from drinking to come back to me in spades. I really don't want to do that. I don't want the newly sober to do that. I don't want this fucking monster of a disease to take *one more person*.  And sometimes those of us that feel this way get a little passionate about it...I love this sub.  I'm grateful for the successes and the struggles that are shared here. I've found myself more prone to want to respond  moderation doesn't work  rather than being more constructive and supporting so maybe I really wrote this for myself. ..Let's do one more day together SD..

When /u/crackedpot_ says this she speaks for me...Thanks.
Well whoever you wrote this post for we are all benefiting. Thank you :)
Moderation doesn't work for me. I can't prove that it doesn't work for you but experience has shown me that it's a subject that is supremely easy to deceive one's self about.
Very nice post...I agree with what you're saying and I even consider myself as being realistic but also harsh from time to time. It does come from a place of caring understanding and fear. Fear for the person that attempts to walk a path that almost without fail does in fact fail...I'd go even farther and say that the use of marijuana isn't something I am against. Quite the opposite. But suggesting to newly sober people that pot *could* be an alternative in my mind in ludicrous. It is encouraging behavior that involves escaping reality. That isn't conducive to sobriety. Sorry for the little rant but I see a lot of newer people suggesting or even advocating marijuana use and I just don't see how that could be positive for someone trying to get healthy. Yes I understand it isn't very harmful physically but getting sober is just as much about mental progress as it is physical...This is my opinion.
Thanks for writing this--for yourself for me and anybody else who reads it. I've got two boys. The youngest is learning to walk and currently has two black eyes from face-plants. The older is sneakily trying to backflip off his bed. It's hard to hide the crash. I hope that I can model sobriety and make it an attractive and normal option as they grow up.
Thank you for your passion for helping us on SD! I feel your love thru the internets! I keep coming back to this forum because it's what's kept me sober for the longest amount of time in years. &lt;3..But I've been wondering something and this seems like a good place to ask about it. In the sidebar it says.."This reddit is a place for redditors to motivate each other to **control** or stop drinking. We welcome anyone who wishes to join in by asking or giving advice sharing stories or just encouraging someone who is trying to quit or **cut down**."..I bolded the parts that refer to moderation at least that's what it sounds like to me. But maybe I'm misunderstanding it. Can /u/crackedpot_ or anybody else elaborate?..Edit: pesky bold!

Excellent post crackedpot... I feel your words resonating deeply from the perspective of self of mother of sister of daughter and of friend.  You're right. It IS so hard to sit back and say "my best to you" when one of them chooses to turn down that same path. It's hard to know we can't save them; that we can only save ourselves. What we can to is just what you say: share about our experience so that maybe some day some time those words may come back to that person.
