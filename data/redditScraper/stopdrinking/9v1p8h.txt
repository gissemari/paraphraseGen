Last month I decided to make an honest effort at not drinking... well it was more like I got scared into it after having the worst blackout experience of my life waking up with a hangover to match and just wanting to be dead. I went 10 days without a drink before I fell back into my old habits. Drank 3 nights in a row and told myself I needed to stop again. Got two days under my belt and fucked it up last night with 5 or 6 glasses of wine. I was struggling to take that first drink and I eventually I gave in. Eventually. That's a hell of a lot better than before where there was never hesitation. I'm done drinking. I know I don't need it and I'm realizing that I don't want it either.

I suggest using the Alcoholics Anonymous meetings...AA works this way; when you have a craving you call another AA or go to a meeting.  You don't have to do anything but make an effort to reach out before you take the first drink...After a while I found that I could get through a lot of terrible things just knowing there was a meeting to go to...Good luck
It's good to hear you finally want to break this habit. Have you seeked professional help yet? I had to go through years of therapy and support to figure out why I was binge drinking in the first place. Once I knew why I was able to better address the issue.
