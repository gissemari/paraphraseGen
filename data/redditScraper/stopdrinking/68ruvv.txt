I have been reading a lot of stories on here about people who a struggling with alcahol I have been fighting this for my whole adult life I'm 33.. but today after being sober sad depressed lonely over thinking I have come to the relization  that even when you struggling your still making progress because you are here .. you are alive I see alot of stories about losing there days of sobriety  truth is if your still trying and you admit there is a problem your still making progress in my eyes everyone is trying to make progress in life in peace in state of being in anything. I'm not sure what is wrong with me I think about it all tge time i ha e to talk to someone (thats why im letting it out here)I get told your amazing you can do anything well spoken clean  whatever but at the end of the day I see that in everyone and it's tough because sometimes poeple look at you or talk you like you have the answer none of us have the answer we are just trying to make progress live love find peace and I wish someone could tell me how to do that  one thing I know is alcahol is not the answer so if your on day one 2 three 1000 for me it's just trying to see the good in everyone ..

Struggling is a sign of strength and if you're struggling that means you're  getting stronger! Something weak can't struggle it can only die. Progress indeed I like this post.
