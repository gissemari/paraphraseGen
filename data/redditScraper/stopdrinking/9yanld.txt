No more good wishes are deserved. I relapsed. I'm a monster. My friends and family deserve so much better. I'm sorry you guys

I am also a monster. We can beat this. 
Dude or Dudette....but you're here.  It's not hopeless.  I relapsed for seven years before finally getting it right (so far).  All the best to you my friend!

You're not a monster you're addiction is
Fellow monster chiming in!  .. I have some monster stories that are so painful and shameful I have never repeated them to anybody.  I say this because I want you to know you're not alone. And people can and do get better every single day
 =monster. ..My favorite line from the movie 'A Star Is Born'.."It's not you it's the addiction."..May you find the courage and strength to forgive yourself and all the monstrous things alcohol has caused in your life. And may you have the wisdom and tenacity to cling tightly to all the good that you know you are. May you never give up. Blessings..
Welcome back! This is an opportunity to learn from your mistake not dive into self loathing and shame. All humans make mistakes. My path has never been linear. .IWNDWYT 
The key is to not give up!
&gt;I'm a monster...That's just the hangxiety talking. Don't listen to it!..Sending you strength.
