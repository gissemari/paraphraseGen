Hello my sober friends! .I hope you are all doing well this evening...I just have some irritating thoughts that I wanted to get off my mind...There is a coworker who I kind of shared my sobriety with. This person is a recovering alcoholic as well and saw me at a few embarrassingly low points.  I felt that since this person had been in AA and I had known him quite a while we could have open discussions. Great. It was nice to hear from someone who had been there. ..What's got me so upset is that he recently told me about when I was struggling to get sober he was wanting to "take advantage of me". (There was more he felt like sharing that i do not feel comfortable repeating) This completely caught me off guard. I just feel fucking violated. I was vulnerable and shared my struggles and it makes me feel so stupid and gross. ..I've kept my distance since. This was about 3 weeks ago. I am not sure if there are gods looking out for me but in this time he has since been removed from my area of my work completely and placed elsewhere. ..I still can't shake this gross feeling. Hope that goes away soon. I will not drink with you today.

That is gross feeling just to read. Goes to show you people with predatory mindsets are everywhere in life. .  I'm relieved for you that he's not working in your area anymore - that's worth a congrats cup of tea!
I'm sorry you experienced such disingenuous behavior. there are better ways to express feelings for someone and after saying something like that is just gross after you shared your struggles with alcohol. I hope this person learned something at least. I hope.
