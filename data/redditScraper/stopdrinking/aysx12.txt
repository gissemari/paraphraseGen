This isn't my first attempted sobriety. Last month I made it to I think 8 months before relapsing hard and winding up back in the hospital. ..Right now my life is really good. I'm back at college and I have a stellar girlfriend and life. I've been sober for five months give or take. But still I am really struggling to stay sober. That addict voice keeps saying  you know what would be a great idea?... just one drink...  I've started going to recovery meetings again but all I think about while I'm there is going to get a drink afterwards. ..The first few months of sobriety after the first couple weeks were so easy. I was sick of alcohol's impact on my life and declined to drink easily. Now that's changed and I don't know why. It's so hard to stay sober these days. I also work in a bar which has become excruciating for me. It's so tempting and it's right in front of me all weekend long. ..Can anyone relate? When does it get easier?

You're experience euphoric recall...  it's a lie... don't believe it..https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoric_recall...I suggest reading "Alcohol Explained".  It completely changed how I view alcohol..https://www.amazon.com/Alcohol-Explained-William-Porter/dp/1516997190/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=..
working in a bar is something not I personally could not do if i wasn't drinking. I don't know your circumstances but that could have a lot to do with you feeling the way you do. but besides for that I really do understand. I made it to even two years (right before this current run) and decided I still really wanted to drink. I quickly realized though it just wasn't the solution to my happiness like I was thinking it would be because overall it just made me feel like shit (especially compared to the health I felt from 2 years of not drinking). I still feel like drinking even after knowing this but I think it's because there's some void I'm feeling in my life that I have to figure out. I also don't go to meetings because I find they have the opposite effect on me as well. I just know personally my mind goes to alcohol because in my mind that has always been the quickest path to not feeling the way I do anymore. what i need now is a much more permanent/longterm solution that is harder to reach but overall so much more valuable than drinking (because drinking doesn't actually do anything to change us in a good way). but yea damn it's really hard to get over that craving for a temporary fix especially in the beginning. 
&gt; I've started going to recovery meetings again but all I think about while I'm there is going to get a drink afterwards...Have you told anyone at the meetings about this? From my experience just "going to meetings" but not talking sharing asking for help etc is similar to going to the gym but not working out. At some point a spectator sport isn't going to keep you sober.
