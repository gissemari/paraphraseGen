I used to think that I had accepted my problems with alcohol by default. I had already admitted that the problems were there and I was doing something to try to fix them. ..Fifty+ days sober and at the first time I considered a relapse I understood that there was something underlying that I couldn't get at from the surface. I didn't know what it was. Something I read over at the beginning of my sobriety in another's stories was their risks of relapsing so far after beating the initial withdrawals. I didn't understand...Here is what I understand now: I knew what I was but had never accepted that I was a miserable alcoholic. I found excuses. I could call myself names and call myself a drunk and continue to abuse myself with alcohol. I could tell people that I can't control my drinking. What I noticed is that I could not find any love for myself anywhere. I was something that I did not want any part of. I was something I had seen growing up and never wanted in any part of my adult life and I could not accept it. So I drank. I drank so that I felt just drunk. When I had to work I behaved as a tool. I did not like any part of myself. I fought my own self-acceptance and stood in the way of any helping hand who cared. I still don't know why I did this. With the help of new found friends in recovery I have no choice but to accept myself for what I am: a filthy stinking drunk who is fighting for his life. Now when I look in the mirror and see my recovering body I can accept it and move on. I thought I was proud of myself for recovering but now I am just proud to be me and I can choose today whether or not I keep that feeling...I will not drink today.

That is the best thing Ive read today! I think I might have used alcohol as a weapon to beat myself with too. Its so wonderful you saw yourself as you should a strong person who wants better. 50 days proves that. Heres to more love of ourselves.
Thank you for posting this.  I am beginning to see that this may be my issue as well.
