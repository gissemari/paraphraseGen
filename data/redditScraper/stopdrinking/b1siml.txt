SoS.  ...(Im doing good 4 weeks here.)   ...One of my friends father is a mssive alcoholic lost very good position at firm been at rehab but relapsed and they really dont know what to do. What advice should I give him (if there is any)?
----------immediate responses--------

No. Nothing external will do it. It has to come from within imho.
All I can do is be a positive example of sobriety offer support when asked and not enable. ..I can't get someone else sober. I can't say the perfect words so they'll finally get it. And sometimes it's better to just listen than try to say anything at all.
Maybe help the son to r/Al-anon?  That sub has helped me understand I cannot help/control my SO drinking.   Take it from someone who has been on both sides...  We can only control our actions and the way we react to a situation. ..IWNDWYT ..
