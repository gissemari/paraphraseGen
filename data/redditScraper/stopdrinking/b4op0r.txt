Next week I'll hit my 60 days mark. I had not experienced my first drinking dream yet but I did last night. I was having strong cravings and kept myself busy and ended up going to bed around 11pm so I'd stop thinking about it. I suppose it manifested in my dreams. It felt so vivid and in my dream I remember thinking I was close to the 60 days and "might as well". I can't remember the last time I was sober this long. It was probably 5 years ago. I woke up thinking I was hungover and freaked out for a moment to realize I was sober and it was only a dream. ..&amp;#x200B;..I've been feeling anxious about my upcoming trip back home too. I'm visiting my sister and spending time with my nieces and nephew. My family is a huge trigger for me. I'm afraid of relapsing while I'm there. I'm staying with her but one of my friends suggested staying a night or two in an airbnb where I will be safe or with her. ..&amp;#x200B;..I'm also terrified of my mom showing up to my sister's house while I'm there. My mom is an alcoholic (rampant in both sides of the family) and we are estranged. Last time I saw her she tried to assault me and pretty much wished death upon me. ..&amp;#x200B;..I haven't felt intense emotions in so long. I'm finally seeing things as they are... my marriage falling apart still grieving my step mom and my friend. I'm feeling vulnerable and lost. My coping mechanism has always been alcohol. ..&amp;#x200B;..Fuck this shit is hard guys! Well this turned into a rant. IWDWYT

Notning wrong with a dream just shows you had a deep sleep. FYI  I quit smoking 45 years ago and I still have dreams where I  smoke and think I  can just have one or two cigiesSound familiar?
