[4 months ago I posted this](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3f6vbz/an_admitted_alcoholic_has_gone_back_to_drinking/)..Quote from that post:  *...she informed me "I made it 97 days then went back to drinking. But this time under control and at max 3 drinks if I go out. So I've been doing well.".I wish her success and happiness...but I think she has forgotten why she quit in the first place. I've seen this pattern before. Is it possible to go back to moderate drinking? I am sure SOMEONE must have done it somewhere....but too many times I see people relapse hold it together for a while and then sink like the Titanic...because they forgot where they started from.*..*****************************************************************...This past month that friend has been realizing she is "sinking like the Titanic"...and she hit bottom last night and ended up checking herself into the hospital.  ..For this past month she has indicated an awareness she should cut back or quit drinking...her "got it under control" was no longer true...and she wanted to try AA again.  I've repeatedly offered to take her to check out my Wednesday AA Home group made plans to do dinner with her beforehand and each time she was all for it.  In fact this last Wednesday was even going to be her and her boyfriend...who also had been thinking he had a problem and needed to stop...but every Wednesday there has been an excuse...and the meeting never happened. ..Thursday night there was some sort of serious incident between her and her boyfriend...(which I found out via Facebook) where there are pictures of a broken doorframe and shattered Christmas ornaments.  The police were involved.  When I spoke with her during the day yesterday she was moving out and going back to live in another state.  ..Last night I got a text that she was checking herself into the hospital.  I called and the boyfriend answered...and said she was being checked in and they were going to get her through it together.  I have made it clear to them both I'm only 20 minutes away and I'm here if she/they need anything.  I have to leave it at that.  ..********************************************************...*Lessons I've learned:*..**Once again for this individual moderation didn't work.** - After initially going to rehab accepting she was an alcoholic and finding 3 months of peace and relief from insanity in sobriety...she went back to drinking.  It started out at 2 or 3 on a special occasion or "when going out".  Earlier this month it was 3 different brewery tours in 1 day with 10 growlers of beer purchased.  It escalated over time.  ...**You can lead even a willing horse to water..but ultimately you can't make them drink (water)**  - She kept saying she wanted to quit...I kept making the offer the plans and kept encouraging her and being supportive..but I can't force someone to show up and make the decision.  Everyone hits their own "I give up!" or "rock bottom" at a different time and I can't judge that.  ...**I am only one drink away from sliding downhill** - I don't know if it would take me 8 months to go from "I can have just one" to "I'm checking in to the hospital".  Knowing myself It would be closer to 8 weeks...or maybe just 8 days....  Moderation isn't an option for me and I need to stay mindful of the reasons I quit in the first place..to keep me away from that old whispering voice that says "Ehh what would one glass of champagne hurt? It is a celebration!".  No.  I'm an alcoholic.  Nothing with alcohol can be in my life.  ....**I am not a superhero.**  - This sucks.  I would love to have some super powers...first things I'd do is cure cancer and addiction.  Sadly me jumping into the car and dragging someone to a meeting or driving myself to the hospital after being told the patient doesn't want a visitor isn't going to help.  I may feel I have "Experience Strength and Hope" to share..but my path to sobriety isn't the only way and (just like so many things in my life) I can't FIX people. ...**The only person I can keep sober is myself**  - No amount of texting calling and encouragement can rush someone to accepting they have a problem...and sometimes that person may NEVER come to accept it.  I am powerless over other people as well.  The only thing I can do is take my own life one day at a time help those who are willing and ready to be helped whatever that help may entail.  ..*****************************************************..I'm not drinking today.  ..Stay sober my friends. ..Mouse....
----------immediate responses--------

Thanks for this reminder Mouse that I can only help someone who wants to help themselves.
Wow I remember that post. Even though I had not gained my footing yet I remember thinking "This will not end well." Thanks for the confirmation of a gut feeling.  .Thanks also for the words of wisdom in response to your friend's relapse. I found them very helpful.  .I hope that someday she will find it in herself to appreciate and acknowledge your wisdom and friendship.
Your friend sounds like me! Thank you for sharing!
Thanks for another very powerful post. ..One of the most painful parts of being an older addict now sober is watching the toll addiction has taken on several people I know personally. I know I am blessed to still have my health wife and job and not ended up dead or in jail. I too would like a magic wand to fix everyone elses problems but I can't hold my breath waiting...Keep taking good care of yourself. I am not drinking today either.
.&gt;I am only one drink away from sliding downhill..I think about this every single day it is so damn important to remember.
Thanks for posting. I needed this. 
I'm sorry to hear about your friend. .Moderation isn't something I do well in anything...work love play I'm all in. So when I think about moderation and drinking or using....I have to remind myself that I don't moderate well. I read it here on SD the other day: "It is easier to keep a tiger in a cage than lead it around on a leash". So true for me. 
Yes very often sobriety is a learning curve. ..One wishes they could offer more to those still struggling but just as a toddler learns to walk we all fall down on our own...It's gratifying to hear your friend has the option of rehab for some it takes more than once. ..All we can offer sometimes is support understanding and love...Great post Mouse. Thank you.
Thank you so much for sharing your story and providing this reminder. I am only newly sober and sometimes I think that I can do moderation after I get some sobriety under me but reading stories like yours makes me realize that will never be a possibility. So thank you again for sharing.
This is very powerful very scary and exactly why I react the way I do to the posts here on maybe I can moderate......In alanon the C's..you did not cause it.     .you can control it.     .you can not cure it.      ..there is a 4th not applicable here     .by enabling you can contribute to it
It took me six ER visits before I checked into a center for 90 days fortunately I was able to stay sober for 7 years after still going strong.  This afternoon i had lunch at a Dogfish Head Brewery restaurant saw all those beers and liquors I used to guzzle not a craving in sight.  Just the thought of the taste of the booze the Foggy brain being a slave to the need to drink it made me sick thinking of it all.
Moderation is an interesting topic for me. I know once I start (drinking) I do not stop until I pass out. I always wonder why that is. I know it is a result of genetics and alcoholism but I wonder what more there is to it. I do the same with other things like candy and video games. Anyone know any good reads about this??
Thanks for sharing a very wise and true post.
People post incidents of domestic violence on FB?  That's weird.  Anyway as to the subject- I tried moderation for 2 years and was spectacularly bad at it.  Now I go to AA.  Life isn't perfect- but I am not a slave to alcohol.  
Thank you for sharing as always. I've had a few moments of weakness lately as time has progressed. This is the kind of reminder I need to see. My life is so much better and continuing to get better without booze. I don't need to go back.
This warning really helps. Thanks.
