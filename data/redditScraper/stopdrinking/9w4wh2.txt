Hi everyone!..Not much going on with me in a good way. Yesterday I went to an afternoon meeting and ran into a young woman whose very first AA meeting ever in life was the first meeting that I ever chaired. I was very happy to see her and we talked and made plans to meet up at the weekly fellowship on Friday. She's struggling a bit with finding sober people to hang out with so I directed her to some young people's meetings and am gonna hook her up with a couple of women in their 20's who I know...Last night I went over to a sponsee sister's place with a friend that I met at a meeting and we watched a movie ate candy and hung out. It's nice to be building a life for myself in sobriety that includes sober friends. ..Sobriety is something pretty significant to have in common with someone else. It's a lot easier to make friends in sobriety than it was when I was drinking. And I feel like I can share things with them because we all share in an honest way in meetings. I don't have to put up a front...The [ Daily Reflections' reading](recoveryreadings.com) today is about self-acceptance and it uses the phrase  arrogant self-criticism.  Something that I've both heard someone say in a meeting recently *and* heard my sponsor say is basically how when they endlessly beat themselves up it's a form of self-centeredness. We're all human we all have flaws and we all make mistakes. Putting too much of an emphasis on flaws and mistakes is a way of making yourself feel unique in an unhealthy way. I feel like when I'm working on my sobriety it's easy for me to see all the ways that I've screwed up and am flawed so it's a helpful reminder...I don't have a huge amount to say today. I'm just glad to be sober and I'm working on chipping away at the things that I'm chipping away on. I hope that you all are well...Ginger_Sprout Out

I love this post sober hanging out sounds awesome. I'm returning to the fellowship as I'm in my twenties quite lonely and don't have any sober friends. When I was drinking I was too anxious and too self-loathing to form new friendships and hid myself away...
Those sound like great meetings and people! Enjoy your weekend!
