I can feel my pinkie toes again! They've been hot the last two days instead of numb and that makes me happy! Not infected hot... waking up blood coursing through them hot. I can't say for sure that my 4 month relapse caused it but they went numb about a month ago. 4 full days sober and suddenly they've come back to life. I think I can stop scaring myself now with the thought of being an 8 toed freak for the rest of my life. ..Edit: No offense intended to any 8 toed persons that may be in attendance :)

Congratulations on full foot circulation...not a sentence I ever thought I'd be uttering.
Have you considered checking in with a doctor in this? Quitting is great but this could be a more serious condition.
