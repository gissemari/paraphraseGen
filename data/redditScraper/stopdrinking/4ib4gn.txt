Doing the first step of AA writing out how alcohol has affected my life really helped me quit and kill the obsession.  
no one's a saint.
I needed help to stop drinking because I didn't know how to do it on my own. AA meetings gave me lots of support. 
This can be a very powerful reminder of exactly what alcohol has to offer as you move forward. You can do it stay strong.
So many (if not all) of us have lived through some sort of parallel experience. Give yourself some grace but vigilently strive to not drink just for today. 
If you wake up you have another shot at it.  Don't give up.  I've made up excuses a million times when I was still using.
Last week I had a similar experience. I DID NOT like how I felt on Sunday. It was awful enough to give me a reminder of what I do not want. Use this as a learning moment. You haven't failed you have learned something. Something significant that will help you in the days to come. You got this! I'm so happy to see that you came back here for support. ;)
You poor thing. Don't pile on the guilt too much...Remember you never have to miss another Mothers Day due to a hangover!
