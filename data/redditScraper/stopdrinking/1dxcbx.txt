Hey everyone it's Wednesday that means the week's half over! How's it been going? Share your triumphs struggles or just general chat!..Triumph: I'm going through outpatient treatment the next two weeks.  It look a long time to get here and I'm proud that I've stuck to it...Struggle: Going through outpatient treatment is pretty intense.  ..General chat: I think it's safe to say the Sun is finally alive and well here.   Summer is around the corner...Have a great 24 hours folks!

You should be very proud for sticking with it. I have a missing family member who didn't stick with his treatment. I hope he somehow finds this sub because there are so many stories here of people (like yourself) who are fighting the booze and winning. It's hard I know. ..Sunny here too tho what a difference it can make on the mood. 
Wednesday! Heck yea!  I slept in this morning missing my morning meeting.  No guilt here I didn't drink. ( I have one tonight anyway) work. I can't believe I am employable.  Couldn't go 2 hours without drinking.  What's not to love about any sober day? .My struggle: working on getting rid of a resentment that has been a cornerstone of my sobriety.  I stayed sober just to show them!  Worried but not worried.  My irrational mind tells me that if I clear it I have no reason to stay sober. Well shit! .The sun sure does feel great.  High 60's here. Can't wait to did out those shorts again
I just finished stacking four cords of firewood.  That's over 12 tons of wood yo.  Also been heavily weeding and planted lettuce kale and buckwheat grass in my garden.  In a little while I'm gonna walk to the post office mail off a couple of items then go to Timmie's and have a cup of coffee and a donut.  I might shoot the shit with some people or I might just sit there and read.  Then I'll come home and... I dunno what.  It's a beautiful day here and I wouldn't be doing ANY of these things if I had gotten drunk last night.

Triumph: Getting comfortable in my own skin - preparing myself for the worst but hoping for the best considering a reconciliation or divorce with my wife (working with a therapist and friends and have to start preparing)..Struggle: My exercise routine is starting to dwindle - having a hard time keeping motivated with this.  Also my local e-cig supplier went under I haven't found another one yet and I can't seem to get around ordering online = I'm smoking :(..General Chat: Got tickets for the new Star Trek movie - going to see it at an iMax in 3d - the person I'm going with isn't a fan but wants to go with me.
Hey all!  New here but have read some really encouraging posts...Triumph: After some stints at sobriety in between six years of chronic drinking I've finally realized I can't do it alone. Been working with a counsiller went to my first group recovery meeting through the local health authority here on Monday and working up the nerve to go to my first AA meeting tonight. I'm only 5 days clean right now but I've never felt so strongly that I can do this...Struggle: Finding people to hang out with that don't drink - or at least don't drink at all social functions...General chat: This subreddit is a really good thing. The sun is shining and I'm feeling really great!

Triumph: well my first year of sobriety was with the help of a psychiatrist. These nearly 5 months since then I thought I could beat a physical brain disease (depression)with a spiritual program and I was wrong. But I didn't let it kill me and saw a dr.yesterday. Just took that first dose of humility and really admitting I needed help this morning...Also! I stuck to my boundaries last night. My exboyfriend approached me while I was studying for finals and I told him I didn't want to talk to him. And repeated it. And told him if he wanted to apologize for being inconsiderate again the considerate thing would be to take my requests into account and considerately leave me alone. He left after claiming this was not "a fair card to play." I did NOT tell him that he would not want to experience fair with me because fair would be lighting him on fire. Didn't say it. Don't owe a crazy person an amends. That's a good thing....Struggle: depression semi-stalker exboyfriend finals preparing for summer internship not in my hometown. ...General chat: peanut butter pie is delicious! Also as a Texan I am so glad the weather is finally getting normal.
Triumph: Got through the weekend totally sober. After two weeks of failing this it was an amazing triumph for me!..Struggle: I'm starting to realize that the impatience I show my kids wasn't all about being hungover... I'm kind of just an impatient person sometimes and I want to work on that...General: I am in such a better place than I was at this time last week. I feel so much stronger and happier too.
Just got through my first sober night in...I'm embarrassed to say how long (can't remember - years probably). You guys inspired me to try 30 days. It sucks big time. All I can think about right now is pouring a big glass of Makers at 6:00...I've scheduled a 5 mile run with my daughter instead because I've read so many comments about withdrawal here that I haven't been surprised as how crappy I feel...Thanks /stopdrinking!
Enjoy the 10 day NMBP! I had an incredibly powerful spiritual experience during my outpatient and it changed my sobriety. ..Triumph: quit my job. So much time for activities. Getting back in touch with my sponsor regular meetings and casually finding a new job. ..Struggle: it's really strange to NOT have to work for money reasons. My fiance and I can afford for me not to work for a month or so and I'm having a hard time letting go and just enjoying it! I feel like I need to be "productive."..General chat: it's ridiculously hot in Ottawa today I'm going to plant my vegetable garden and let the bunny run around. Happy days.
Triumph: Traveled did not drink though had good opportunities to do so. Not even close...Struggle: Don't know if it's a state in my sobriety or life in general but do not give a fuck about some things that have been important to me forever. More selfish. Trying to figure that out but also acting out. ..Chat: Heading out for a 8-10 mile run after which everything will be better. Did not stack firewood today yo.
we used to do something like this at the halfway house i stayed at.  we called it high low pink green.high of the week.low of the week.pink-personal life/girlfriend.green-money..its awesome you are going through put patient whay so late if i may ask?
On day 3 here intentionally sober for the first time in months. I'm prepared for today and tomorrow to be the toughest physically but so far it hasn't been awful just anxiety-producing. Two years ago I made it 40 days sober my record for the last 7 years. I feel more motivated than ever like my head is finally above water and I don't want to take this moment of clarity for granted. ..Last time I thought "Oh I'll just drink on this vacation." I was 25. Now I'm suddenly 27 and don't want to get sucked back into the drinking time warp only to emerge when I'm 30 or 35 or never. You guys here at /r/stopdrinking have been an amazing inspiration for me the last few days!
Good luck with the treatment!  I hope it goes well for you...**Triumph**: I've achieved another milestone... I'm on travel for business and staying in a room by myself for just under a week.  Before this would have been prime time for drinking until I pass out.  But I haven't had any urges or anything.  I called ahead to make sure that the room wouldn't have a mini bar...**Struggle**: I can't wait to get home.  It's been rough to sleep with my [rib injury](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1dqg7z/interesting_effects_of_pain_drugs/) and I miss my own bed (and my wife)...**General Chat**: I've been walking around the city a lot this week so even though I didn't get a chance to ride a bike over the Golden Gate Bridge I've been getting some exercise.
triumph: made it to 7 months. quit the job i hated and stayed at way too long. i get to see my parents soon for the first time in months...struggle: pretty much everything. my boyfriend and i broke up finishing up my schoolwork has been really tough and i've been struggling to just get out of bed. not having a job has been a nice much-needed break but also leaves me with no real reason to get up for each day. i'm glad i'm not drinking but things have been tough. ..general chat: movies are good. seltzer is good too.
