discharge..	.     Face to the mattress .in a dark room with three other strange men sweating out the alcohol and watching the sun rise in a state of shock I realized I'd hit bottom. .When I closed my eyes I saw imaginary hallucinations of things transforming into other things. Things were happening in my subconscious that made me afraid I may be going schizophrenic. When I opened my eyes I gazed at what I guessed was another suffering filthy person in the same boat as me coughing and gagging and talking nonsense in his sleep. It turned out he was just some homeless guy abusing the system and I was a lost kid in a dark room on the last bed they had seeking sanctuary from myself. i couldn't trust myself anymore so i'd voluntarily locked myself in here. I looked up and saw someone peek through an interior window into the hospital-like bedroom. We were being observed to make sure we didn't die in there.	..I remember being afraid to close my eyes because I'd see these strange visions of things I was certain I'd never seen before. Maybe the devil was infiltrating my brain. A skull being formed out of clay would get bigger and bigger until its eyes would burn flames forming the face of President Obama or some famous image. I could hear my mother yelling from the other room even though she wasn't there. I could hear my brother insulting her. I didn't know where I was sometimes and had to consciously remind myself. Every so often my brain would send an electric jolt from one side to the other shocking my body into a twitch and I would open my eyes again. What were these symptoms? I wondered. Could I be going mad?.	.Maybe it was missing that tiny dose of that new pill they put me on to treat anxiety I didn't have. It could be the lack of alcohol in my system. For years I thought my symptom was caused by the lack of alcohol in my system and the alcohol would make it better until it got worse. It could be insomnia. I couldn't diagnose my extreme case alone with all the medications I've either not taken because I've forgotten to take them or taken double of because I forgot that I did. It could be because I chased nothing with two bottles of wine and wasn't able to eat for possibly 48-72 hours. Gee it could be that..	.I had messed up royally. I had become completely paranoid. I was obsessed with what was wrong with me when the answer was staring me in the face. Several bottles of pills with confusing names next to several empty bottles of booze - and no recollection of consuming any of them - can make a man go mad. I wasn't trying to hurt myself. I told myself I was trying to feel calm or normal or cure some kind of symptom. I wasn't being honest with myself. .	.What time is it? What day is it? It was dark outside a bit ago. Now it's light. That means it must be morning. And then it hit me   I had to catch a flight later that day - a flight to the other side of the world..	.I finally sat up giving up on sleep and decided I might try to eat after not eating for two days. I barely stood up and walked down the hall to the office..	. I was wondering if   I was having a hard time putting my thoughts into words..	. How are you feeling?  the addiction therapist said..	. I think I can eat my sandwich.  I said.  Am I going to die?  I held up my hands somewhat shaky. I looked at another guy in the room maybe younger than me..	. No  he said.  I've been shaking for four days. .	.I decided I didn't belong there. I discharged myself took all my meds and walked out into the cold winter air noticing there was snow and ice on the ground. I wasn't sure of the last time I breathed fresh air sober..	.I was getting my energy back finally and walked through the old concrete underpass towards downtown. I had to return my books to the library before leaving the country for three weeks. .	.	How the hell did I get into this mess?..NEXT PART: http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/18b814/four_ounces_of_courage_part_2/
