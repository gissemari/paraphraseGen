Last year was so bad.  My drinking reached frightening levels I went to the ER twice and finally went to detox last May.  Detox was horrible but since then I haven't drank that is until last Friday.  I took a red eye to New York and after a 6 hour bus ride up state I'm alone in an apartment I have two weeks off from work and there's beer in the fridge.  After six months of sobriety and piecing my life back together I drank and I loved it.  I felt euphoric and relaxed relaxed for the first time in months.  I only had three drinks but the next day at 9am I bought a six pack and and started drinking I drank all day and night bought two more six packs and got so drunk that I puked on the floor I had a phone interview and barely got through it slurring my words my girlfriend asked me about my slurred words and I told her I was tired.  ..But it's ok now I've stopped.  I feel like shit but I'm back on the wagon and I won't beat myself up for it.  One relapse in six months I say that's pretty good.  I've been a binge drinker since 17 and am now 32.  For the first time in my life I'm addressing my traumas and reevaluating how I cope with triggers.  This week marks the anniversary of my fathers death who was an addict and alcoholic.  I lived through hell growing up and it's taken a lot to heal from that...After slipping I'm picking myself back up and hoping this hangover/withdrawal won't linger for days.

That's pretty good! If you jump back on the wagon and let it take you away you'll be way better than me - I was off the wagon and under it for 4 months after a very strong 6 months ride on the wagon. ..I will not drink with you tonight!
Be kind to yourself.  These things happen.  Learn and live. Look how quickly you realized and came back here.  Back at it :) Not drinking with you today
