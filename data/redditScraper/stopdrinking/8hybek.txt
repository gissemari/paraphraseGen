Holy hell I can smell everything and it's amazing! I can smell the bananas in the fruit bowl while I'm cooking breakfast and the fresh cut grass in the park across the street. Seeing my body change with each day really is interesting. I never thought I could do this.  :) To those who are struggling with those first few days don't give up! &lt;3

Ha yes I remember when my sense of smell returned too from wherever it had been.....Round my place (having been a bit lax on the housework in favour of getting sloshed all the time) it was more like "*Where did this medley of disgusting smells come from? Have they been here all along*!?"..A lack of Zinc can also dull one's olfactory acuity so make sure you're getting enough in your diet or consider taking a good multivitamin to help things along.....Congrats on your 1-week milestone for tomorrow!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Your blood pressure is probably dropping too if that's important to you. Congrats on the new nose!
Thank you!!
I have the same! I smell the spring flowers everywhere and I also really notice more tiny beautiful details like the bees in the rosebush some nice arabic art on the roof and stuff :)
It's weird hey!
I live in a large city and have to take the subway most days so I've found this to be a blessing and a curse. :)
Hahahaha
