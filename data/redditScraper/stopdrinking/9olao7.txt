So happy to have you back. IWNDWYT   
Yay for you!! Welcome back! I've found an AA group that I truly enjoy attending. So much love and support. You have the tools!! You can do this! P.s. 33 days for me :)
Welcome back.  Posts like this confirm what I have seen too many times - and help me stay on the path....
Congrats on 34 days and more so for coming back! Thanks for the reminder to stay vigilant on my sober journey.  Stay strong! I will NOT drink with you today! Peace

Well my friend you are back. You will have mixed emotions I know. I won't go on with what you know now...Instead I am going to say well done on coming back. Thank you for sharing. If this is not motivational what is. ..Give me a room full of 1000 guys with 50 years sobriety. ..Give me 1 you...I want 1 you. That will do more to give me an incentive to hang in...1 day at a time. An attitude of gratitude ..I am here for you.  1 day at a time I will be sober with you ..Your Friend John
