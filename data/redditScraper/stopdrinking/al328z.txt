I don't even know why I did it. I guess I just wanted to drink to remember why I quit if that makes sense. Now I feel like shit and a failure.

Slip ups are going to happen. You aren't a loser or a failure. Just get back on the right track my friend. You can do it. 
I have done this so many times....and I pick myself up dust myself off and keep trudging forward!!  IWNDWYT 
Guilt is useless it only weighs you down. 4 and a half months is a great record. Just carry on the same way you did before :)
You're awesome that is an awesome run and something you and all of us can learn from... certainly better than I have ever done.  Congrats on the 4+ months and get back up on that horse!  You can do it!
Just a bump in the road of a long journey. 6 months is the goal - go get it
Well now you remember why you quit right?  It's so stupid what we do to ourselves.  Brush yourself off and move on.  I bet we've all done this.
lose a battle win the war / a set back is a set up for a comeback   IWNDWYT!  
You haven't failed. You had a relapse. There's a difference. Now's the time to do some research. Stop sit think: what prompted me to drink? Was that really it or something else? What was the cost of my action? What benefit did it provide? Was it worth it in the balance? Did I get the answer I was looking for? It's a chance for learning at least.
Get back on the horse we know we can't drink..We're all with you brother.
Do not beat on yourself toooo hard. Just get back on the sobriety path and brush the dirt off.
