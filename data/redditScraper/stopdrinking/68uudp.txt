I've been sober for 33 days today.  It has not been easy but I feel like I am in a pretty good place right now.  I'm scared to death of a relapse and am wondering for any tips or advice on staying sober.  .Thank you.

Congratulations! 33 days is awesome! ..I come to SD daily. Reading relapse stories helps me remember why I can not drink. Reading victories reminds me of where I hope to be one day. Being active in conversations here also is a huge help... how can I offer support if I'm not following my own advice? ..I will say that although I started feeling physically better after a few weeks my mental state needed much more attention. [Post Acute Withdrawal]http://alcoholrehab.com/addiction-recovery/post-acute-withdrawal-symptoms/) (PAWS) was a real bummer for me. I wanted to give up daily but luckily (or unluckily however you want to view it) my liver was not healthy and that was a *huge* motivation to stay dry. ..Good luck to you! I wish you all the best! I will not drink with you. 
Congrats.  33 days is a fantastic achievement   How to stay sober?  Easy really:..Rule 1.  Take it one day at a time.  No point looking too far ahead. ..Rule 2.  Just don't have that first drink.  Ever...Rule 3 . Carry a mental tape that you can play forward to see yourself if you don't follow rules 1 &amp; 2 :)  ..Also grab a badge and enjoy watching it grow.  Reading books on stopping drinking also really helped me...Whatever works for you......but just enjoy being sober healthy and booze free :)
