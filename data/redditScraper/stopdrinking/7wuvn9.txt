I still read the posts here and there but haven't participated much lately. Not struggling with the alcohol as much as I am finding joy and peace in every day things. I am sitting by my kitchen window looking at snowy rooftops and listening to Jeff Buckley. I have found my peace for today. Can't believe it's been over 40 days. Here's to 40 more..As always hope all is well.

Congratulations! Its one of the things I enjoy the most about sobriety- that is the ability to find joy and peace in the simple little things that I used to miss before. Right now I've got like 20 bucks in my bank account (something that would normally stress me out) but I've had friends and family visit this weekend and going to make a good dinner for my family tonight. I feel happy and at peace.
Chicken cordon bleu and scalloped potatoes. All from scratch! Sunday is our big family dinner night so i usually try to make something special.
