Prior to this I've never taken a trip completely sober. I used to always start my trip by hitting up the airport bars immediately and starting things off immediately. Not this time. I'll be in the heart of San Francisco for about a week to enjoy the cold weather/museums/shows/etc etc. I'll be solo for the first 2 days but then i'll be meeting up with some friends/family members over the course of the next few .... the problem they ALL drink and have already offered to take me to some bars. I haven't said anything to them yet but I'm hoping they understand my decision because I really don't want to ruin a good time for them. I'm not too worried about relapsing I'm just more worried about what family/friends will think. Wish me luck.

Don't worry about it it's you that has to live with drunk consequences not them as long as you stay sober that's all that matters hope you have a good time.
I don't know if AA is your thing but there's TONS of great meetings in SF. Hop over to Oakland too if you want something different.
