I'll probably write up each night I've spent. I guess I'll post them here but I generally try not to since there are possible triggers and I don't know the exact rules about stories on here. I just wanted to post here saying that I got through my flight fine. I had posted about my worries of flying and potentially relapsing to battle anxieties. It went great as I finished a book and didn't have any problems...Aside from the flight I've been going out each night with my friend. We basically went out and explored during the day and did as much as we could. Long story short I would have never been able to wake up at 9-10am to hike the Runyan Canyon or visit the Griffith Observatory had I been drinking due to my hangovers. I'd have never been able to drive around with a rental and get us place to place during the night. There is so so much I wouldn't have been able to do had I continued doing what I did for the past decade. It's really bizarre to me how much I was able to see and do by abstaining...The only real issue that remains is my social anxiety. Even that is still continuing to dissipate. We went out and I followed my friend's lead. We went to school together and call us douche bags or whatever but we always went out to meet women and have a good time. I don't know whether that's a bad thing or if it makes us bad people. I mean I never was looking for commitment or whatever. So yea regardless that's the only remaining scenario that puts me at risk. I still like to do that kind of stuff and I won't lie it's tough to do sober...Except it's beginning to clear up. The lies I mean. Alcohol lied to me for long about my not being able to do it on my own. I truly believed I needed to drink a third of a bottle of scotch usually straight from the bottle because the point wasn't to do it right it was to get it done in order to go out and socialize. I was too rigid and too uncomfortable with myself or so I thought...Jesus I spent the past 3 nights just being me. Sure I got put in embaressing situations. But. It wasn't that bad. Frustrating sure but end of the world nah. Did I wish I had a drink in order to make things easy of course. But I know that's in the past now because I can actually see the change in me. This is probably the best vacation of my life and it's been entirely dry. So that's something...It's still not over. I met this stunning woman last night and we ended up hanging out and talking. I was dying for a drink at certain points but I stuck to the plan. I remained resolute. It was cool because she wasn't like the woman from the night before who took a beer and tried at least 3 times to force it into my mouth. No this woman actually didn't even bring it up. And it was great. ..Now I know the rules. She may not actually come out tomorrow when I call her. Maybe she will. Maybe she'll come out and it will just be as friends or maybe something will come of it. I don't know. All I really know is I had a great fucking time and it was me being me. The real me. As uncomfortable and as awkward as I can be at times it's me. Fucking me. And she seemed to like that. So I can't wait to see what tomorrow brings...Best vacation of my life. Maybe the only real vacation of my life.
