I sometimes get so down on myself in facing all of the damage my drinking has caused and the fact that I have known about this problem for so long and still have relapses. It's easy to get to a place where we just feel fundamentally flawed and weak and like horrible pieces of shit..But that's not true. Recovery is hard being honest is hard and being able to face our mistakes is very hard. But I've found that if I can add compassion in that is what gives me the strength to keep going..Because being an alcoholic destroying my life and relationships and then trying to show up at work the next morning and pray I make it through while hiding the guilt and coping with the anxiety and depression from another bender that's fucking hard. Living like that for years is hard. And if I have the strength to barely maintain when I'm in those dark times then I've sure as hell got the strength to quit..It's not easy but we've had the strength in us all along because living the life of a drunk was already the hardest thing I've ever done and I've made it through that alive..We're not bad people were strong people and we've got this..IWNDWYT

Very true. Thanks for sharing!
I've never looked at things this way.  It definitely puts a different slant on staying sober.  For sure in many ways it's way easier than the drinking life...Thanks for your post and IWNDWYT.
