I've been following this sub for a while and even created an account last night with the intention of sharing what I assumed would be my first iwndwyt post. I went to a gp who referred me to a counselor congratulated me on seeking help. Even told my brother (a chronic alcohol) that I was struggling and seeking help. When I got home my roommate asked if I was buying beer tonight and I immediately crumbled. I was so sure today would be the day my life would change. Maybe tomorrow?

Maybe.........I found that I could *Create* a drinking problem all by myself.  However I learned that I can't *Solve* a drinking problem without support...Tried a recovery meeting?
Only YOU can decide when you stop drinking. It sounds like you need a plan of some kind. PG suggested a meeting &amp; I agree. Any fucking meeting regarding drinking is better than you drinking again today. Find one right now. Smart Recovery AA SOS Women For Sobriety Al-Anon or listen to some sober podcasts read books there are online meetings too. The point is I had to *do* something with myself. I couldn't just sit here &amp; wait for Sobriety to knock on my front door. I had to *go get it* I wanted it that badly. It's not easy no but if I can get sober anyone can. I truly wish you good luck but please take some action for yourself! Call the counselor that your MD referred you to right now.
Like everyone else said try a meeting.  At the very least its a solid 2 hours of not drinking.  30 minute to get there an hour at the meeting and 30 minutes home.  An hour is a victory.  Even if you don't make it the rest of the night that two hours is a start.  Who knows you might even get the strength from the meeting to make it the whole night.  Do it again the next night and every night you need it.
You can do it friend...I got through 30 days and had to reset. Take it one day at a time 
I think for those of us with drinking problems failing miserably is just about the only way to fail no half hearted efforts here! I look at it like this if I wasn't in jail didn't hurt myself or someone else it could've been worse. To me it was a sign or even a gift that allowed me to try again. I picture myself in jail after running over someone's child how would I feel then??? That thought that picture in my head is enough to scare the daylights out of me. ..I found this 15 min Ted Talk to be very helpful maybe it will speak to you too. Best of luck hang in there!..[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EghiY\_s2ts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EghiY_s2ts)
