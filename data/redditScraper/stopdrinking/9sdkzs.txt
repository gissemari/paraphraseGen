Have been sober exactly 4 weeks now and just going to put down how exactly those 4 weeks have gone for me just so I can clear my own head and hopefully help anyone in a similar position. What I have learned:..&amp;#x200B;..\-It gets easier and easier every day..\-You have to be accountable to something (For me it is the daily check-in on this sub)..\-You have to tell at least one person you are close to. My fiancee knows and so do a number of close friends..\-Reading This Naked Mind was a massive help and helped change the way I look at alcohol..\-I now don't even crave alcohol it's just not part of my life anymore..\-My sugar cravings were through the roof for the first 3 weeks but I'm slowly easing off..\-It's so nice not waking with a hangover and having a clear mind..\-Now when something is worrying me I write it down there and then and come back or just deal with it straight away instead of hiding behind the mask of alcohol..\-I'm a lot happier even if it can get boring at times..\-I've never smiled as much..\-I have never had as much free time on my days off from work I'm able to do all my housework do some reading watch some tv meet friends and still have time to myself to do whatever I want..\-I have a lot more energy and from tomorrow will be converting that into exercise again which I used to love to do..\-I have a lot more disposable income and managed to start paying for driving lessons pay for a weekend away for me and my fiancee and book flights home for next month with some left over..&amp;#x200B;..To anyone out there who is struggling to quit or is in their first few days take it from me it can be done. I was you at one point and never thought it possible that I would get to 28 days and right now it doesn't even feel worth celebrating because this is just who I am now I don't drink. Best of luck to all of you out there. IWNDWYT

On day 10.  I'm looking forward to all of the perks of sobriety!!  Thanks for the post!!
Bravo!
i like to joke to myself that i have transferred my addiction to saving money. probably half true but i'm realizing i can probably move into a nicer part of town
I'm at day 30 and I'm still a sugar monster but I'm starting to think maybe I always was! Candy is better than alcohol any day tho so bring on the gummies!
I like "it's just who i am now". That feels very healthy thank you.
