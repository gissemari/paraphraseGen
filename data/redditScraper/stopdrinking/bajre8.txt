I thought I was doing really well. I've been fired from like 3 jobs since 2016 and I always blamed it on showing up hungover not being able to control my temper and also not being able to critically think about things or have a good attention span due to drinking. I've been sober since 12/28 with one small relapse and I still got fired. It hurts a lot and I'm struggling to figure out what is wrong with me..I stayed sober though! My diet took a punch I indulged in cheese Mexican coke and Ice cream and dropped the OMAD thing but I will get back on that wagon soon. .I am not much into AA but folks here have really helped with the chat room and sending positive messages. Thank you for listening and for your continued support.

Sorry that you lost your job. Proud of you for not drinking during that time though! I would look at it like you were meant for a better opportunity. There is nothing wrong with you. Life happens and looks like you are dealing with it as it comes. Hang in there. IWNDWYT
