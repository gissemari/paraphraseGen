Tonight my mother got in a car accident (her fault) from drinking and driving. ..I can admit that I myself have drank and drove multiple times. Oh because I'm a GREAT driver and even more cautious when drinking. I was FINE. ..But sometimes you're not. We're all out here struggling but I hope we can all make wise decisions together...I haven't heard from my mother in over 3 hours. I know that no one was hurt THANKFULLY but it is very likely that she went to jail for a DUI. Although I don't really feel bad for my mother because she did do this to herself but I am very sad and scared for her. ..Please be careful guys. Someone out there loves you and you are far too important to get behind the wheel while intoxicated.

I guess it is a lesson everyone can learn from no one should drink and drive ever. And I wish people would gossip less about other peoples drinking and driving experiences and more about their own. But of course talking about our own experience is way more shameful. Much easier to talk about someone else.
