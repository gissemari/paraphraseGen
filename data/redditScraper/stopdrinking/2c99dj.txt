i relapsed last Saturday when i became particularly depressed and drank until Saturday.Woke up on Sunday with regret and to a messy flat.I soberly cleaned and berated myself for failing yet again when i was sober for 20 days.I always feel guilty after drinking.Trying to keep myself busy and im drinking pints of tea instead of reaching for some rum or vodka hoping to get to day 30  this time.

What are you doing different this time around? Definitely each setback is an opportunity to add something new to the arsenal/try something new until you find what clicks...Also don't worry about getting to day 30. Just get through this next hour.
You don't have to get to day 30 today. Just get to the pillow sober by the end of the day. You can do this! Get support from live humans!
