If you read this thank you. ..During my last relationship I relapsed on alcohol a few times. By the third time of relapsing my ex was so sad and was having a hard time forgiving me and trusting me. He told me he'd break up with me if I relapsed again so I didn't drink or use any of my other vices. ..I broke my leg while we were together and I got some pain meds. He was ok with this because I was in so much pain and the pain was unbearable for me and I felt like I needed them. ..Like I said I stayed away from alcohol but I abused the meds three times. It wasn't anything horrible but I know what my intentions were when I took them. The guilt was killing me and I wasn't ready for my ex and I to break up so I kept it to myself. I didn't tell a single soul. I knew if I told my sponsor she'd ask me to come clean in the meetings and inevitably my ex would have found out. My sponsor fired me soon after. I suspect she knew what was up. I think everyone did including my ex. I was downright miserable. ..My ex knew I was miserable but he didn't know what I had done. I think he had his suspicions but I denied it intensely and kept telling him my sober date is March 21st and just because I'm taking meds does not mean I'm not sober. I got my two month chip soon after we broke up and while I hadn't drank for two months I was not fully sober for two months. ..Anyway the guilt ate me alive and the secrets were keeping me so sick so I relapsed on alcohol pretty much immediately after I got that two month chip. I couldn't live with the regret of hurting my ex and myself and for being the alcoholic liar I was so I drank 24/7 for about a month. ..Now I have 15 days (FULLY!!!!) sober and I never want to lie like that again. I fully realize now I need to be 100% honest with myself and trusted people in my life no matter the consequences. ..It was a learning experience and I'm trying to find the strength to tell someone in the program about this situation because the guilt and shame is still eating me alive. I hate that I got into this relationship that I wasn't ready to be in and that I killed both his and my heart in the process. ..I'm glad I had that full on relapse because if I didn't perhaps I'd still be lying about it today. And I'd stay sick. ..*I know my post wasn't fully about alcohol but I needed to be honest. Mods please leave this up and if it is in danger of being taken down please tell me how I can critique it to leave it up. I'd really like some feedback or something because I need to let this secret go.*

Welcome back! Forgiving ourselves is so hard but I like to remember that we are changing constantly. You're not the same person you were yesterday or a month ago. You can and you will love again. Keep it up!!
