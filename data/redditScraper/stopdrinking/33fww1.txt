I like the group support element an  have met genuinely caring people. Everything else about it has begun to strike me as bullshit. People end up powerless because they tell themselves they are multiple times a week. The say the alcoholic obesseses over the idea of drinking. and its like no shit your in a club where all you do is get together and talk about alcohol constantly...I understand the  idea of  powerlessness is about humility but power  is  tied to responsibility. If you don't have  power over your drinking you can't be responsible for whether you drink or not...>We are like men who have lost their legs; they never grow new ones. Neither does there appear to be any kind of treatment which will make alcoholics ofour kind like other men. We have tried every imaginable remedy. In some instances there has been brief recovery followed always by a still worse relapse. Physicians who are familiar with alcoholism agree there is no such thing as making a normal drinker out of an alcoholic. Science may one day accomplish this but it hasn't done so yet...Science has done so. It's called Naltrexone and AA fights tooth and nail to keep it out of treatment programs. ..I'm finding the whole thing to be rather dishonest. Especially when it comes to AAs founding and the role of psychedelic drugs. ..I found it helpful initially but once I no longer have a court card to get signed I don't think I'm ever going to sit through another meeting.
----------immediate responses--------

Thanks for sharing.  I understand what you're saying.  .If you like the support of the group I encourage you to keep searching.  I found a couple of SOS groups and a Buddhism mindfulness step group.  All non AA for me now.
Are you going to take Naltrexone for the rest of your life?  Honest question cause I don't know much about it and how long it is used for.
psychedelic drugs played a part in its founding?
Okay..
I respect your opinion. I've had some of these thoughts myself but I still attend meetings because I always feel more peaceful afterwards. I don't agree with every aspect of AA but appreciate the support system. I've tried Naltrexone myself but felt instantly depressed afterwards. For me my motives for drinking will never be normal even if I was on Naltrexone. So in that way it's not really working. I'd rather work on the root of the problem why I want to drink in the first place...Anyway end of rant. ;) Have you read Allen Carr's book? I'd highly suggest it if you feel like AA isn't working. I read it myself and it gives an different perspective on the whole drinking thing. Helped me a lot in the beginning!
You're reaching the same conclusion that I came to a while back. I went weekly for about 2 years but the broken record that was AA became nauseating and infuriating. ..I can understand what they're going for: when you drink you're fighting a losing battle so if you don't drink you won't get your ass kicked by alcohol. However the way they go about it by saying that you're powerless is self-deprecating and depressing. You're going there to get sober not feel bad because you have a problem. ..The other problem I had with AA is that they blame all their failures on themselves and take no credit for their successes. It's always "*I* messed up and drank last night" or "*God* kept me sober this week because I woke up and prayed for him to help keep me sober every day." No dude you woke up and made a commitment to not drink every day. This is cognitive behavioral therapy. You did this so give yourself some credit. 
OK - do what makes you happy. ..What I really want to know (and I speak for most of us I believe) - do you hit Caps Lock for each individual letter or do you use shift?..I prefer 'shift' to hitting Caps Lock.   Seems more economic.  
Man I hear you.  It sure is hard. ..But I have to tell you.  Beating up on a treatment program that literally helps millions is a pretty angry thing to do. ..That's the type of anger I feel before I head out for a relapse...Take the pill do the research.  Maybe that stuff works.   But that's controlled drinking.  And that's not what AA is about. ..So why would it be encouraged in the rooms?...Personally I have power over alcohol.  But only if I keep it away from my lips.  If I have a drink I'm powerless to stop until I run out or pass out ..I and every person I've ever met in AA has done that research over and over again with conclusive results. ...If you change your mind you know you will be most welcome.  
Ya know there's a lot about AA that can cause people to not like it and stop going and dismiss it as not being helpful.  What's great about the age in which we live is that there are alternatives many of which have helped a lot of people...I found a great deal of help in AA and was able to rebuild my life while staying sober for around 16.5 years but I drank again.  I don't fault AA so much as I had doubts and needed to experiment again to solidify my mindset...The idea of powerlessness really comforted me in the early days and helped me "get off my own ass" about fucking up my life with drinking so much and so often.  I just let go of that shit and it was very helpful...However as time went on I made some of the same arguments you're making.  I mean I chose not to drink and I chose to go to a meeting - how is that not power over alcohol?  Well I never got a satisfactory answer and today I'm convinced it actually IS an exercise of my power of alcohol...I'm actually quite happy I relapsed but I'm also happy I spent all those years in AA.  I'm learning more and more about myself and my relationship with alcohol...Today I find that I just don't want to control my drinking when I'm drinking.  I like being drunk - not the blackouts and the shit that goes along with it.  I like the fact that I can ingest a substance and within a few minutes actually start to feel A LOT better happier etc.  The problem is I can't seem to control it once I start drinking and more often than not drink to excess and pass out...I also hate the side effects. The hangovers the depression the shakes the sweating.....goddamn the fucking sweating after a hard night of drinking I mean where the fuck is all that liquid coming from because I feel so dehydrated...So for me today I want to stay sober because I enjoy life more - not because I'm afraid that "for me to drink is for me to die".  I don't believe that stuff anymore...Be sure to check out the sidebar on the right side of this subreddit for many helpful alternatives to AA...I wish you all the best in your journey and remember you don't have to trash something like AA or turn it into something bad to simply assert that it's not for you.  You can simply walk away...I sincerely hope you find the help you seek. 
In the age of reddit when something is repeated we call it a repost. Very early on in AA the beginning of meetings felt like a repost over and over. ..I tend to try to arrive 5-10 minutes late to skip out on the reading of the steps/traditions I've already heard countless times. I'll usually skip out 5 minutes early as well. That way I get to soak in the sharing and bypass the reposts. 
Personally I take the book and messages to be more interpretive... And I sometimes tune out stuff that doesn't work for me. We'll see how that plays out with my sponsor and step work. For now it's a support group that will listen to me and understand. But yeah I decided not to do the 90 meetings in 90 days because after doing 3 meetings in 3 days I was sick of thinking about alcoholism so much and wanted to use my free time for things that made me happy. Some meetings are heavy...Also I think this is a polarizing view you're taking so I appreciate that you posted it. I just hope we can all act civil about differences of opinion here.
Check out SMART Recovery.  It's an evidenced-based program founded on rational emotive behavioral therapy not the 12 steps.  
&gt; People end up powerless because they tell themselves they are multiple times a week. The say the alcoholic obesseses over the idea of drinking. and its like no shit your in a club where all you do is get together and talk about alcohol constantly...This is what I thought AA was like.... before I ever went to a meeting. Now granted every meeting is unique and I'm sure there's some degree of regional variation. But I don't think I've ever been to a meeting where people sit around and talk about alcohol. There is some discussion of the consequences of drinking and I guess people talk about the cognitive distortions they had during their active drinking days. Not a whole lot of discussion about alcohol itself or being drunk. There's a lot more talk on *here* about alcohol drinking and being powerless over it than I've heard at any meeting...The concept of being powerless over alcohol in AA isn't about humility. And it does **not** mean that alcoholics are powerless to stop themselves from taking a drink. *That* type of powerlessness is expressed here several times a day when people post to explain their latest badge reset or say why they're ready to stop drinking - tomorrow. The doctrine of powerlessness in AA does not excuse continual relapses. I'm powerless over alcohol *after* I have the first drink. Not before. ..The program isn't about making excuses it's about taking responsibility. That's what the steps are *about* - being honest about your behavior looking at it critically taking responsibility for it and making active changes to address unhealthy and damaging behavior. Working the steps is *hard* because it requires total honesty and means letting go of justifications and excuses...Your post to me sounds less like a well reasoned and insightful critique of AA and more like someone getting ready to justify drinking. If you can return to normal drinking with naltrexone more power to you. Nobody's trying to stop you. (Except the courts apparently.) AA is not the only way to get or stay sober. And sobriety isn't for everybody. Good luck with wherever this adventure takes you and please keep posting.
Different strokes for different folks. If you found it useful for a while that's a good thing take away from it what you can.  If you leave I hope you'll still find what you need to support your ongoing sobriety...I couldn't connect with its principles though I do appreciate the cut-down version of 12 steps that's been posted on here recently. The principles of SMART were more resonant with me (science-based and personal power). However AA does seem to excel at the social networking and ongoing support; SMART seems weaker in this area and tends to be more time-limited. ..That said the AA statement isn't dishonest IMO:.&gt;Physicians who are familiar with alcoholism agree there is no such thing as making a normal drinker out of an alcoholic. Science may one day accomplish this but it hasn't done so yet...Naltrexone  is a treatment option available that may be suitable for some alcoholics but it does not make a "normal drinker" out of an alcoholic. 
I go to AA to get my chips and when I feel like I can benefit from what other alcoholics have to say. I have never practiced the steps or traditions and am celebrating 90 days sober. I've never had a sponsor either. So yeah. It's best to take what they say with a grain of salt.

AA is a voluntary spiritual program created by people who wanted to stop drinking for people who want to stop drinking...It should have nothing to do with the institutions that are forcing people to attend. If you do not wish to quit drinking or have a solution for your problem that involves naltrexone or have a different way to stay sober that works for you that is absolutely OK...&gt; AA fights tooth and nail to keep it out of treatment programs...AA doesn't fight anything. Treatment programs keep it out of treatment programs. AA doesn't have any control over treatment programs. This misunderstanding and the roles that treatment centers and judiciaries have taken in mis-appropriating AA into their treatment plans is at the heart of all of this controversy. ..AA has changed my life for the better in many ways and it also has helped me stay sober. But that doesn't have to be your story. That is why you are free to come here and share a different story. I am glad you are doing so and I hope you continue to share your positive experience with others here who may be in need.
I think AA is something different for everybody.  After a couple months I reached the same conclusion as you but I'm really glad it was there for me when I needed it early on - I think AA is responsible for my current sobriety!  ..I'm glad it's there for people who need it every day too.  No shame in that at all.  But there's no one program that works for everybody and there's no "wrong" way to get sober!
I too hope you never *have to* sit through another AA meeting again...I was court ordered to AA and hated every minute of it.  I didn't even concede as you have that it was helpful initially.  I thought it was BS from the start...However I ultimately found myself to be one of those people who fit their description;  I drank again despite every desire to remove alcohol and its consequences from my life.  In fact I attempted to quit multiple times using several scientifically 'proven' methods and they all met with failure.  So back to AA I went and made the admission of powerlessness...If you are in fact one of those people who's brush with the law or family intervention helps you to make the decision to quit drinking and you make that decision stick that's great...I wish you the best in your endeavors...But I also hope you remember that should you find yourself completely backed into a corner with nowhere else left to turn  AA and all its BS will be there for you willing to help the hopeless...Thanks for posting.  Seriously.  Although I am an AA member I am not one to just expect blind praise for the program and a little pushback helps me keep things real. It helps me remember that first I once believed just like you do and secondly although it worked for me AA does not for everybody in all situations.
I come from a family with LOTS of alcoholics. All of them except for myself are/have been involved with AA. All of them relapse almost like clockwork and never make it more than a couple of months sober. They say their addiction is too strong that AA allows (I usually hear "expects") relapses (it's part of the process apparently) and failure is what happens when they're trying to do it themselves instead of letting "god" take control. That's bullshit.. .To me drinking or not drinking isn't a spiritual matter it's a matter of redirecting a biological predisposition to addiction (something I would guess a lot of us here have). Whether we like to admit it or not we all chose our addiction to alcohol- to say otherwise is a lie nobody put that first drink in our hands except us. We have control we maybe can't stop our addictive personalities but we can choose what to be addicted to. I chose to no longer use alcohol and now I seek out healthier "hobbies" (addictions) like hiking reading and writing...Please don't read this in an angry voice- this is only my opinion. I honestly do believe people should use whatever works for them and if AA works for some then great have at it. I am however a bit frustrated because I've just recently had a confrontation with my drunken family members who aren't happy (practically angry) that I quit without using AA and I've been sober longer than most of them combined (OK maybe I am a bit angry).  I know that not all AA groups are a mind fuck like the ones my family members attend but it's enough bad mojo to make me very very wary...TL;DR: I have an addictive personality. I deal with it by redirecting my addiction from alcohol to other healthier things.
I've been to about 10 different AA meeting locations in two states and I simply haven't had the experiences that you've had. If AA isn't for you that's cool but meetings vary based on where they are and who attends...Also I take Naltrexone and would hardly feel confident in becoming a "normal drinker" by relying on the drug. I can abstain without worry so I choose to abstain. I'd gain very little by having a beer or two now and again. Further I've never heard anyone in AA badmouth Naltrexone and I find it hard to believe that there's a hardline stance on it--or on *anything* in AA really except for the 12 Steps and 12 Traditions. I mean "The AA Member Medications and Other Drugs" pamphlet says that AA members should not "play doctor" or advise others on medication provided by medical practitioners or treatment programs so I really have no idea where you're getting this information about an official AA view on pharmaceutical treatment aids unless you can cite something...Oh and I think there's a monumental difference between attending AA of one's own volition and having a court order to do so and I honestly don't know if I agree with assigned AA. AA is successful when someone wants to be there and isn't resentful about it.
FWIW in my time in the program (which saved and continues to save my life) I've never once encountered anything like "AA fights tooth and nail" to keep Naltrexone out of treatment programs; never witnessed AA objecting to anything that helps people recover. Anyway not here to argue just to wish you luck and to remind you that if you ever need help we'll still be around.
Naltrexone kept me from drinking until I stopped taking the Naltrexone. There had to be a shift in my desire to drink. As far as I know there's no medicine that does that.
I believe you're wrong about some things.  Let me share how I understand it...Powerlessness is about the abnormal physiological reaction in the brain to feel good stimuli.  AA described it as an allergy back in 1935...The root cause as to why the alcoholic continued to take that first drink even after admitting it was injurious is due to selfish self-centeredness.  ..The solution to that detrimental selfish self-centeredness is to adopt a certain attitude (focus on doing the next right thing rather than the results which is faith) and take certain actions (steps 4 thru 10)...I will concede to your point that CBT is basically AA without the higher power aspect...And remember the book Alcoholics Anonymous was published in 1935.  They admitted back then they knew only a little.  Bill Wilson learned more in the 20 years that followed and wrote about in the series of essays that became the 12 Steps and 12 Traditions book.  Unfortunately AA has chosen to "not fix what isn't broke" and hasn't modernized it's program over time and therefore it's only in the pamphlets produced by GSO where the more current learnings are published...I didn't "get it" my first time in 12-step programs which was court ordered...But when I went back on my own accord desperate and was willing to earnestly give the program a shot I ended up adopting that attitude and did those things which in turn saved my life...Good luck to ya!  I know you're not in the best mental and emotional place right now.  I can empathize with that!  ..
&gt;If you don't have power over your drinking you can't be responsible..It was the same for me. When in detox going to group meetings was helpful and so were a lot of things AA taught. But after getting out I found meetings to be less than helpful just like you...I think we must consider our recovery something we create for ourselves rather than trying to stick to the patterns set up by other people for themselves. *If you take full responsibility you can free yourself for good.*
I have found AA to be helpful.  I was a heavy daily drinker and while I continue to relapse I am functioning better now than I have for years...I certainly don't take everything as gospel at AA like some of the "Big Book" thumpers do...I have found the networking useful.  It's a great relief to be able to have a coffee with people who are struggling like me and with people with long term sobriety...I think the best approach is to consider the suggestions and try to see what works.  ..I made the mistake early on when someone who was insisting what I needed to do as a newcomer.  I didn't ask her for advice and she was so insistent about what I should be doing so left that home group because I didn't have the wherefore all to tell her to leave me alone.
I agree with you - AA is not for me and I pull more strength from this sub and a couple of close friends than the meetings
AA worked for me despite my objections issues and misgivings...My concept of powerlessness is that once I start drinking I am in deep shit.  I have the power not to drink and use it.  Its that simple...As for talking about alcohol - the meetings I go to talk is about overcoming the things that made us want to drink in the first place the drunkalogues are rare.  ..There are other paths I hope you find one that works as well for you as AA has for me...
If Alcoholism is an illness it is logical to also believe there would be differing levels of disability with this illness and consequently different methods of treatment. I have been going for over two months strong without a single AA meeting but I plan to attend one if I find I need that extra help. It may be that it is easier for me to quit. Perhaps because of physical or chemical differences or because I have a wife and two children I made a promise to...I am simply saying look for alternatives that fit best for you but don't tear down something has and is working for so many others...Good luck and don't have a drink today.
The thing that bugs me about AA meetings is all the drama amongst the "regulars"....and every group has it. I've been to many different groups and mostly keep to myself. The bickering that goes on just amazes me; it's very childish. But then again we are talking about alcoholics and the childish behavior really shouldn't come as a shock to me. I've taken a break from going to my meetings but will return soon. 
I think that AA *can* work for many people but that doesn't mean that it is a necessary component of anyone's sobriety. Despite AA's claims we don't know why some member stay sober and why some fail. That said there are about as many varieties of meetings as there are Christian churches. Sometimes starting your own meeting is the way to go. ..EDIT: also the steps obviously provide a complete and on their terms responsible method for managing alcoholism. They might not appeal or be credible to you but the notion of powerlessness is always attached to the notion that despite this we can manage our alcoholism thusly (and then the rest of the steps). However this is only one method and one that is of its time. There are harm reduction programs that offer a successful alternative and are usually available through a little research into your local health institutions. That said if you're in a rural area and killing yourself through drinking that AA meeting is probably the best option you're ever going to find. IMO.
&gt; he say the alcoholic obesseses over the idea of drinking..Really? I haven't thought seriously about drinking in decades...&gt; no shit your in a club where all you do is get together and talk about alcohol constantly...I wouldn't go to an AA meeting where they did that either...&gt; I don't think I'm ever going to sit through another meeting...OK...&gt;  AA fights tooth and nail to keep it out of treatment programs. ..Yes of course because of all the money AA makes from alcoholism.
I'm not a big fan of the whole powerless thing either but here's a translation of the 12 steps I've found incredibly helpful. It is trite but the steps really do work if you work them...Step 1: I'm in a mess and over my head..Step 2: Maybe I don't have all the answers.so I'll ask for help..Step 3: Decide to pay attention to advice given..Step 4: Take an honest look at how I've been living my life..Step 5: Tell someone else about my unhealthy lifestyle and harm to others..Step 6: Decide to live a healthier kinder life..Step 7: Make specific changes toward that goal..Step 8: List everyone I have hurt..Step 9: Have the courage to tell them I'm sorry &amp; make amends except if doing so would cause harm..Step 10: Keep an eye on myself alert to old thinking and behaviors..Step 11: Be aware of the beauty in the world and people..Step 12: Pass on to others the kindness extended to me.
On the topic of naltrexone I tried it for a few months. I couldn't bring myself to take it. Its not a magic bullet. I'm sure if I had begun to take it I would have stopped after gaining control. Abstinence really changed things in a hurry by comparison. 
The quoted text appears to refer to making a normal drinker out of an alcoholic not an abstainer. I believe that this idea mostly holds true today. Naltrexone does anything but make normal drinkers. I think most of us would agree that alcoholics generally must choose all or nothing for the long haul.
AA has no opinion on outside issues therefore does not fight tooth and nail for anything. Nor does AA "have a monopoly on recovery" as it says in their book. Find what you need wherever you find it. Hopefully the solution you find brings you happiness.
Um I agree with your points but I found that meetings also differ greatly. I found the late night meetings horrible and most of the night ones left a pretty blah impression. The best one I found only met once a day during lunch and it was a bunch of old timers that got together just to talk about why they stay sober. I found the whole aa experience really changed by club and time of meeting. The best is when people take aa with a grain of salt and use the clubs for friendship and support. The big book has its flaws and aa works best when the big book is not treated like the bible.
I've avoided AA here locally. I had a friend get a couple of DUIs and had to go court ordered. He told me everyone there was there because of court orders. No one was there of their own free will. I don't want to be around those people. Also I think it'd be bad for me to be around people that do nothing but talk about booze for an hour. I think that hour would be better spent doing activities with people NOT talking about booze.
Before I read anyone else's comments I would like to say a) I agree with many of your criticisms completely and b) AA is free!  And right now it is the only thing between millions of people and premature death or pointless survival in alcohol's prison.  So I am generally planning to keep my yap closed about it for now.
AA is one path but it is not the only path. Have you looked into  [Smart Recovery] (http://www.smartrecovery.org/meetings_db/view/)?
&gt; there is no such thing as making a normal drinker out of an alcoholic. ..This is 100% true.  
[deleted]
Yeah I have never been a fan of all that AA stuff.  If you want to get off alcohol why would you keep associating with other alcoholics regardless of their current drinking behaviour?  ..The best way is to associate with groups of people who have nothing to do with alcohol and who are alphas.  This will be extremely hardcore at first but will get you off it and make you stay off it.

If you don't want to be sober and doing this for court and not for yourself its not going to work. I said the same exact thing at one point and an old-timer handed me five dollars and said good riddance. I stayed out of spite then I stayed for myself. AA is not made by gods it was made by two men who wanted to combat a spiritual and thinking disease. Of course AA won't be perfect but we are not either. AA gives me tools to handle life and change my way of thinking and give up my using and drinking. I had to be willing and it seems to me my friend that you have not gone through the first step. Good luck in all your endeavors and as a post said AA and the we of the program will be here with open arms if you ever come back.     .     .And as a side note. Yes Lois and Bill tripped balls but they are human too. Take a look at role models you have they have flaws as well. There is no use in trying to find perfection when we are not perfect ourselves but we are trying.
My issue with AA is the whole idea that recovery requires you to become spiritual. I am not and never will be spiritual. When I was shaking and desperate for anything to help me quit drinking I tried it for a simple lack of anything better but now that the shakes have stopped and that desperation has faded I can't fake it anymore. 
I've always hated AAs  way of dealing with an atheist just keep an open mind you'll eventually belive In  god Or something.
I found yoga helped me a lot. There were a couple of times when my drinking was getting borderline out of control. I never actually hit rock bottom but I could see it was entirely possible (soon) and that acted as a wake up call. Basically there were a few times in my life where I went through a major depressive episode and very ~~stupidly~~ ignorantly thought a drink would help me unwind and relax (as it had done in the past) -- but I did not know until too late that I was using it as a crutch to mask some underlying psychological pain. To treat this people need healing and not poison...With yoga the thing is you have to find a good studio that will teach and support you but also challenge you in the right ways. It has to be a vigorous practice where you sweat a lot (Vinyasa Kundalini Ashtanga maybe hot yoga -- have not tried this and I know many yogis who consider it a "short-cut" to generating the internal heat the other practices lead to *which will literally make certain parts of your body super hot to the touch*). This will have the added benefits of super-charging your body's detox getting you in great shape/stamina helping you develop greater self awareness understanding and compassion and also help you develop greater self control and mental fortitude. You'll know you've found a good practice because the ~~sweat~~ poison will literally be *pouring out of your body*. Not joking. Have literally never sweat so much before in my life and it smells **horrible**. But it also doesn't last forever. Maybe a few weeks to a month max if you are working hard enough. (Drink at least a gallon of water daily and pretty soon your will only be sweating out water -- you can tell from the taste when it will inevitably get in your mouth. Do yourself a favor and stop consciously eating salt as well.)..It takes at least a month of dedicated effort to start to reshape our unconscious behaviors and habits. Buy yourself a month unlimited pass someplace close to you and go as often as possible. (Hopefully someplace not too overwhelmingly large/crowded so you can get 1-on-1 attention during this very crucial beginning/transformation). Go at least once a day every day. If you can do that start doubling up on classes especially whenever you feel a craving. If you start to do this you will soon know enough to lead yourself through a basic series of postures and meditations (for at least an hour or two) if you ever feel a craving coming on and it is not possible to go to your studio. You have to push yourself past your comfort zone but also have to have the knowledge or supervision to be able to do this safely. It is very easy to injure yourself in yoga if you are not aware of what your body is doing yet...A studio will give you the support of a community without ever forcing you to talk about alcohol ever. Most of the people there are working through issues of their own and in my experience you can have some very self-enlightening/revealing/ absolutely-completely-open-and-honest conversations right after class (i.e. in the parking lot or sidewalk). Try your best to honor the space of the studio as a sanctuary and not talk about negative things inside it. It is a place where you can learn to move on and not dwell on the past. ..I also highly recommend drinking Yerba Mate. This tea is made from the bark of a tree in South America and has been considered to be a rejuvenating "elixir" for centuries (maybe longer). It helps greatly with detoxing and staying healthy afterwords. It has an earthy robust somewhat grassy taste that I find pairs really well with raw honey. Raw honey is also great for detoxing and if you use Manuka honey from New Zealand it is **super powerful**. Yerba Mate has some caffeine in it so if that is not for you or you want to go to sleep soon I highly recommend a big cup of hot water with LOTS of lemon in it (like at least half a lemon) as well as some raw honey. **It is very important to only use raw honey** as over-processing rids honey of a lot of its medicinal and healing properties and processed white sugar is also a bad poison...Good luck!!!!!! Never be afraid to ask for help! Yoga's really the only thing I can think of where you can develop humility as well as personal power/strength inspiration and responsibility.
Dude.  I feel the same way about AA.  Cult-like in that it convinces it's members they are powerless against it.  ..But they aren't.  You aren't powerless against it.  I've seen my cousin go down the shitter because he is *convinced* he has no power to control himself when it comes to drinking...It's an addiction and addictions can be overcome.
Step 1 says we admitted we WERE powerless. It's past tense. Getting sober gives you the power of choice back. 
I agree with a lot of what you said especially the power bit. I am not powerless over alcohol I am not drinking therefore I do have power. AA seems so incredibly protestant that it kind of pisses me off and that is why I rarely attend meetings. Kind of curious what the percent of people who love AA come from a protestant background would be?

There's a lot of bad AA. So much in fact I've lost interest. ..My issue is that it's the only wide spread form of treatment. I don't accept that I need spirituality as a requirement of recovery. Time and time again people told me that I wan't moving forward because I didn't have a relationship with a higher power. That's the problem right there; trying to apply one form of recovery to everyone. ..Good AA is supposed to be take what you need leave the rest behind and don't presume to tell anyone but you how to recover. ..I once heard "don't let god chase you out of the rooms". This talking out both sides of your mouth is so prevalent it's scary. God and higher power stuff permeated everything in meetings. It was in every step every story and the christian prayer that ended the meetings in my area. I didn't let God chase me out of the rooms it was everyone's subtle and not so subtle insistence that I need a higher power...There's many different recovery programs and methodology available. The first part of recovery should be finding what works not adjusting your self to a one size fits all program with highly questionable practices. ..Naltrexone is an amazing tool. I take an antidepressant to fight off anxiety why can't I use something similar for addiction?

[The Irrationality of Alcoholics Anonymous](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/03/the-irrationality-of-alcoholics-anonymous/386255/)..Wonderful relevant article not only about the flaws of AA but the inexplicable aversion to prescription recovery drugs in the US. I think you'll find it helpful...Lance Dodes who is quoted in the article is worth a read. Check your local library...Also +1 for SMART recovery..
I have JUST gotta say - THIS IS AN AWESOME thread!! ..
I tend to think that every program has some merit for some people.  You just have to find one right for you.  I'm new at this no drinking stuff but just a thought.

That phrase "take what you need and leave the rest" is what helps me through a lot of AA. That &amp; reading the 12&amp;12 especially it's chapter on the 3rd step. ..But you're right: AA has it's faults. I'm kind of an AA-er and I'm with you. AA in my area because it's broad enough I won't speak for all of it does not protect members against predators enough. That's my biggest issue for sure. I know you didn't bring that up but that's one I'd add to your list...And if I count to you as an AA-er I want to say I'm sorry for where I fail at my responsibility in fostering a healthy self image and in combating the twisted parts of the program. I work really hard with my sponsees on what powerless does and doesn't mean. It doesn't mean that taking action to fight your disease is worthless it doesn't mean you're totally helpless. It means that self-sufficiency isn't enough the same as "normal folks." Alcoholics aren't *that* different from the rest of the world. We just have a quirk in circumstance around alcohol that leads us to an uglier end than a lot of folks. ..I think AA fails a lot in this language of powerlessness given who the book was written by and too. The 100 who wrote it (and importantly Bill W.) had ego issues. I'm not a guy and frankly I didn't have too big of an ego. I needed some freaking self worth to decide I was worth a good life I was worth getting sober for. The book wasn't written for people on the opposite side of the spectrum and when we tell people who already feel and are powerless that yes they're powerless we do them a disservice. We aren't showing them the other side of the coin- which is really what is needed. ..One of my favorite lines in the 12&amp;12 is on page 40- "But now it appears that there are certain things which only the individual can do. All by himself and in the light of his own circumstances he needs to develop the quality of willingness. When he acquires willingness he is the only one who can make the decision to exert himself."...As for the med thing the groups I attend don't have those anti-medication biases but I'm sorry you're experiencing them. I'm all for harm reduction and abstinence. Naltrexone Anabuse antidepressants etc. If they help you stay really truly well go for it. I take a mental health med. Sponsees with a little time who struggle and I even suspect it's got anything to do with something besides alcoholism I tell to go see someone. I'll stand there and make the appointment with them. People who have trouble quitting I'll tell to talk honestly with their doctors about it. There's a pamphlet in our meeting that talks about AA &amp; medication (and I'm sure it's on the website I'm just on my phone atm) and it says clearly that we're not doctors and we shouldn't stop people. ..If you'll take a suggestion I'll revisit this post on my computer &amp; link to the pamphlet. If you're interested in getting some for your meeting I'll even pay for it. Letting off steam is well &amp; good but if you're really afraid that AA is dangerous and you're forced to be there please help me make it less dangerous. There are problems in A.A. You see them. Unfortunately that means you can help fix them or in 2 years when someone posts this message again (or worse how they were hurt) all you can do is say "I called it &amp; I left rather than tried to make it better." And really nobody wants to see the negative future and then say they didn't do their part to prevent it...Edit: Link to Pamphlet-  http://www.aa.org/assets/en_US/p-11_aamembersMedDrug.pdf
AA isn't fighting to keep a drug out of treatment. ..But.. as they say take what you like and leave the rest. I somewhat burned out on AA. I still go once a week but I have another meeting that is recovery related that is much more useful. Too many armchair psychologists in AA.
Ok. Don't. Don't ever sit through another meeting. But I haven't had a drink in over 1000 days. I have a better relationship with my wife my kids my co-workers and people I meet in everyday life. If you can get that somewhere besides AA good for you! But dangerous? Only if that's what you want it to be.
AA saved my life. I AM powerless over alcohol. I know that if I relapse I'll be worse off than before. I read the big book and I know it was written for me. But if it doesn't work for you find something else. Don't waste your time on something that's not helping. I hear that smart recovery is a great alternative. I hope you find something!
Take what you need and leave the rest. The last time I went to a meeting was on my one year anniversary. Before I even got out of my car and in the door people started telling me where I could or not to park and asking who I was looking for what my DOC was whether I was sober from everything or just alcohol who my sponsor was...When I said I was not new to AA just felt like being at a meeting on my 365th consecutive day of not drinking they started telling me the "rules" of that particular group... No cross talking no talking to the women no looking at the women. (I'm not new not there looking a date  have always known to not bother the ladies or cross talk a person with a year sober would know that much obviously but they had to tell me anyways. I couldn't get a word in edgewise.) one person went on a tirade about newcomers. It seemed like everyone who shared was angry and bitter. Some staring at me as they spoke. the last person to share ended the meeting with another tirade. When I asked for a phone list they told me that they didn't have one they don't give them out.. (Someone might call a woman!) Anyways I could have walked out and dismissed AA as a whole and said that it was a waste of time but experience told me that I can just go to another group and not ever go back to that particular meeting. Some of us are sicker than others. I'm still sober and my side of the street is clean. That's all that matters. I don't have to go to a meeting every day but some do. If that works for them great my sobriety is working for me and I don't have to be in charge of anyone but me. Peace and good vibes to you. Don't give up don't drink and If you want to take a break from meetings that's okay. They'll still be there if you do feel inclined to go to one at a later date.
I went to meetings my first 6 months sober and if it wasn't for AA I may still be drinking. After 6 months I went on vacation didn't drink then quit AA. I didn't want to talk about booze all the time anymore. Alcohol doesn't define me. It was a big problem so I stopped. Extremely happy with life now. I do feel thankful to AA.
Sorry to be late to the party but I have found I have the same issues with AA... I've been trying to get past it wondering if (and being told that) perhaps it's a personal "block" or the alcohilic part of me being arrogant and trying to be a control freak. ..But no. Lately I've been realising that being out of control and struggling to control my alcohol intake may mean I'm feeling powerless right now and perhaps I am but it doesn't mean I am not capable of controlling it provided I make a change. It's the crazy urges to drink the cravings and my neurochemicaln reponse that I can't control but surely I can by changing my habits and way of thinking (maybe?) change the way I respond to them thus decreasing their occurrence... Thus empowering me.....Ramblings
