I had 125 days last summer and relapsed in September to a point of getting very drunk 1-4 times a week. I've had probably 30 day 2's since then each time resolved "never again". I can and have made lists of reasons to quit - health money the people I love hating the untrustworthy person I become. But there's that part of me that sneaks up on me and says "you can handle it this time". It's me lying to myself or my disease lying doesn't matter how you look at it. It's the idea that I can do what I want which is to get drunk. ..I can't pretend it's all bad - it's pretty dang bad but apparently making increasingly desperate lists of the bad stuff doesn't help. So I'm trying to think about how to do it differently this time. I have to be willing to give up what I think is good about getting drunk - locking myself away in solitude listening to music watching Netflix chatting on the phone (or later online when I'm too drunk) with my family/friends. Seeing how the world moves when I disengage from it. Turning off my conscience or whatever other part of "me" I feel locked into when sober. Getting away with it - I suppose I like that I kind-of get away with it! ..When I look at this list of benefits the word that comes to my mind is "selfish". I like to think of being dedicated to helping others. I actually left a higher-paying career to dedicate my life to doing so but I've been teetering between a few month stints of sobriety and longs stints of drunkeness in the meanwhile. However although there have been consequences since relapsing generally I am getting great feedback. So when I act so selfishly it's contrary to what I'm presenting myself to the world as and it feels all the more awful...What's the answer? Well it's "stop drinking". I think the question is is that REALLY what I want to do? The evidence is to the contrary. Although I don't completely feel it I will say that although of course I wish I didn't face consequences that sucked I am willing to give up what I love about drinking too. That's why I'm on here rambling lol because my attempts to do it on my own in the last months have failed and failed again and I'm trying to find an answer that sticks.

Unsolicited advice; plan your free time in advance.  Have a long weekend ahead and plan to just chill?  That's risky.  Plan a cool activity instead!
Your story really resonates with me.  I enjoy all of the same things - solitude music (with headphones even better) Netflix disengaging.  In the past I got drunk to do those things too.  ..I wouldn't say that those are selfish indulgences necessarily.  I think they are introverted.  Introverted people need solitude to recharge their batteries.  What I've found is that I can enjoy my solitude much more without alcohol.  Drinking doesn't really enhance the experience or anything else at all...So perhaps what you're thinking of as selfishness is really just a necessary part of your personality - the need to occasionally recharge with some alone time so that you can engage with the world to help others. Maybe you don't need to drink to disengage but can just allow yourself the freedom to enjoy solitude without the alcohol.  ..It seems to me that if you're wrestling with your use of alcohol then at some level you really do want to change your behavior (moderate or stop completely).  But as long as some part of you believes that you are denying yourself by not drinking then alcohol remains a "forbidden fruit" that will continue to tempt you - the guilty pleasure that you get away with.   I've struggled with this as well.   I recently read a great book "This Naked Mind" by Annie Grace that really helped me put my use of alcohol into perspective.  The problem isn't you - the problem is alcohol itself.  Seeing this clearly has allowed me to rethink my assumptions about what I really enjoy.  Consider the possibility that the benefits you ascribe to drinking may be attainable in other ways.
