I haven't seen this guy post in years but he just recently released this video where he has a guest on talking about how he's sober and his own struggles with addiction and recovery and man this echoed with me a ton. What's more is that the creator I used to watch (he got me into writing a lot as a kid) actually talks about how he doesn't drink as well - which is pretty damn cool. ..is it just me or are there more and more people coming out publicly about not drinking lately? like not just the old guys but younger people as well? i think they nailed it best in the video where they talk about the stigmas about it slowly going away and using it to treat underlying mental health disorders and how it kills over 3 million people a year (wtf)...dont know i'm around 30 days sober and this made my day - kind of serendipitous to stumble across this. I only listened to the first half before running here to post it gonna download the podcast on itunes and listen to the other half at the gym! ..anyway it made my day maybe it'll make someone elses'..link (if allowed) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM8JBwrtRwk

I've noticed more people being open about not drinking lately too. Idk if it's because I'm not drunk or a coincidence lol. I think sobriety has started to trend some too. Especially in the fitness world...I've always really liked Andrew Zimmern and found out yesterday that he used to a homeless addict/alcoholic. It's funny the things you stumble across when you stop drinking!..I'm glad you found something that made your day :)..Iwndwyt
