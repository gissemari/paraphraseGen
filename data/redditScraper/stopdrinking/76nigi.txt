This was overall a good week. I finally feel healthier and am into a good nightly routine that I actually enjoy (walks with the dog healthy food tea and SD before bed. I went to my first AA meeting and ended up going to 5 over the course of the week. I'm not sure I love it yet but I am determined to do something different this time around. Everyone has been nice and welcoming and I will definitely keep going to keep myself focused. .One struggle was my weekend. Felt strong going in. But I had several family functions--all of which involved drinking. Almost everyone in my family drinks and though they may overindulge at parties it's always fun lighthearted and just seems to enhance their time visiting with everyone. It's hard for me to be around this at this point in my journey. But I have a very close family and opting out is not really an option. No one pressures me or makes it a big deal but my cravings were definitely there this weekend. I made it through though. Happy to be winding down with the dog and some tea. Thanks to everyone here! I thought of you all a lot over the past few days. Have a great week!

I can relate. My family is the same everyone is drinking. I think I started drinking at age 16 with them. I been getting by the last couple weeks but the holidays are bugging me. Been burping a lot recently not sure if its alcohol withdrawals or if I have some acid reflux but almost everytime I eat I have to burp like constantly for a hour+. That may be may go-to excuse from now on.
