Just 3 months ago I was facing so much uncertainty and my situation was essentially hopeless by that point. I had just came off of a 14 day bender unemployed sick sad frightened and feeling alone. ..In such a short period of time life has turned for the better. My fiance and I have a healthy relationship between us. Feel healthy and much happier today. My only regret is not putting forth the effort to be sober years ago. ..It certainly hasn't been easy but it is worth it. I sometimes feel lonely because I miss some people who I associated with regularly but the benefit from the distance is what is necessary. ..God bless all of you guys. I wish all of you success in life and your pursuits. If you're struggling...remember that it is possible.
