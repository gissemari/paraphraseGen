Any great motivational music out there that resonates with being sober struggling overcoming?  What songs lift you up?  What are you listening to good people of SD?

The sound track to Yes Man is one I enjoy.
Blues of all things :)..Listening to Joe Bonamassa at the moment...IWNDWYT!
Iron Maiden - Wasted Years
The album Til the End by Mitis- absolutely beautiful
Freedom by Beyonc  and Kendrick Lamar is dope
The soundtrack to *Beasts of the Southern Wild* always has me sobbing tears of gratitude for fortitude. All instrumental but so evocative!!!!!!!! All the songs sound simultaneously sadly nostalgic and joyously future-focused triumphant. Standouts are the [theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFFiaTOAWIc) and my personal favorite [this twan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6ESnzuBomk)[gy ditty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6ESnzuBomk) that erupts at the 2:20 mark and makes me feel like I am at the helm of a boat.
I popped in a mix CD from highschool the other day and was gobsmacked to hear the lyrics to my own alcoholic existence spat back at me by Galaxie 500. 23 and definitely ['Crazy'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMCnh22jJ5U). The little girl version of me who burnt that CD never would have predicted that it would become a prophecy fulfilled.
Monaco - What do you want from me.  .New Order - True Faith.  .Manic Street Preachers - Everything Must Go.
Macklemore has a lot of great stuff. Tom Macdonald too if you like them
I have switched gangsta rap to bruno mars american authors and all that. For me anything uplifting that doesn't glorify drinking does the trick.
"Arcade Fire - Wake up" is good for lifting you up. .."Benjamin Tod - Using Again" and "Blaze Foley - Clay Pigeons" won't lift you up but will resonate with struggling with addiction. .."Jon Butler Trio - High for a living" is a pretty powerful song to me as well.
Everything's Right - either from the bakers dozen or Trey Anastasio Band. Tons of great lines in that one and the repeating mantra of  everything's right so just hold tight 
Spoken word artist Clayton Jennings has a lot of great stuff that I related to the early stages of my sobriety...It's very God preachy but that doesn't bother me.
