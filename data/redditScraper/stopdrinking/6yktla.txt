624 days nothing special about today besides everything. It seems like such a random number because well it is. But I have been clean and sober one day at a time 624 times. Something I never thought I could do. I feel this post is important because recently I have been struggling with wanting to relapse because of the lack of self care that I have been taking part in. The difference is now I will make that changes instead of taking that drink or the drug. ..I quit my first full time job today. I was very happy but also very scared. I left that job for another full time job that is going to help me take care of myself much better than I have since getting the other position 4 months ago. I tried over and over to tell myself that it wasn't the lack of self care it was just the stress and working 60 hours a week. But it was nothing besides the lack of self care. Sobriety is so much more than putting down the drink and the drug. It's a way of life and I neglected everything except actual physical sobriety. ..In order to get back on track I had to remind myself of where I came from. What was I like in active addiction? I was a mess. That's what I was. I fed my depression and anxiety I attempted suicide twice I lied and stole. I tried so hard to tell myself that I wasn't sick. That I didn't have a problem. The shit part was that it worked for a long time. Addiction is the only disease that can convince you that you don't have a problem. ..There is a lot that I could talk about that got me into active addiction. But I won't bore you with the details. You don't want to hear that. What's important is I faced it all. As scary as that shit was I did it. I did it for ME. It's so important that I finally did it for myself. In my opinion that is the only way it can work. I can try to do it for my mom dad brother girlfriend friend really anyone. But if I don't want it I will get nowhere. ..I have never been more inspired to tell and share my story with others. Mostly because of my girlfriend. She has made me feel like I have an impact on this world and that my words do matter. I want to especially help those early in recovery or thinking about working on their problems. If I can inspire just one person I will be okay. Do I still struggle sometimes? Sure. Do I still have doubts? Yeah. Do I believe that recovery is the greatest thing that I was ever given? Most definitely. I will never stop being grateful for this gift.
