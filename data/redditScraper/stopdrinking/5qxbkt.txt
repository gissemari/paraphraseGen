Hi I've lurked here before - often contemplating quitting booze.  Today is the day though I have no other choice.  My drinking is wildly unpredictable.  I'll go weeks without a drop or have perfectly normal nights drinking a beer or two with friends.  Then from seemingly no where I have a full on rager that always ends in near catastrophe.  Last night was one of those nights.  ..I'm honestly terrified right now.  I've always balked at the idea of completely quitting because I'm afraid of a hardcore relapse.  I'm surrounded by alcohol from the military to college.  I could really use some advice - anything.  ..As weird as it sounds I'm not even sure what makes me tick - why I can't control myself sometimes but am fine others.  I can't even describe it to loved ones.  Selfishness? Depression? Anxiety?..All I know is that my only option is a complete.hard.stop...Thanks everybody

Just posted a few minutes ago. I think I got the same feeling you have. You discribed it way betted though. I scare myself too. I can go way too far with alcohol while I'm also able to control myself around friends. .Can't tell if a complete hard stop is the way to go. I guess I got to talk about it anyway.
I am on day one too after a rager Friday night. I have quit before but each time convince myself it's ok to take a "night off" and get wasted. The resulting days of hangover anxiety and shame are so not worth the few hours of buzz. I wish you the best. 
I'm also coming to a complete stop today.thats it! Done!thank you.
I did this last Saturday. Painted the town red. Woke up sick dehydrated anxious depressed. It's just not worth it. I will not drink with you today!
