Hi - I'm two weeks today. One of the primary reasons for quitting is my struggle with anxiety. Alcohol is either the cause or greatly exacerbates my anxiety. ..If anyone can share changes (mental physical social whatever) both positive and negative they experience when giving up alcohol along with the timeline for when you recognized those changes (one day one week one month 5 years whatever) it would be a great motivator for me. ..Thanks!
