I am returning to AA tomorrow a year after my first attempt to get sober. I hit rock bottom after my third relapse earlier this year. Unfortunately it may cost me my career aspirations but I know the most important thing is getting better. I'm 23. I can sort this out.. I hope. Wish me luck!

We can do this.  ...I didn't get sober until 25 tanked my career badly ruined every relationship I ever had was facing prison time and dying of my alcoholism (literally... cirrhosis of the liver). I was homeless living on a friend's kid's bunk bed sometimes.   ...My first sponsor I went through all the steps with got sober at 19.  ...What I mean is no matter your age alcoholism doesn't discriminate.  ...This can be the last bottom if you want it to be. Just remain teachable look for the common space and speak up. Let someone in...&amp;#x200B;..Most importantly work with other alcoholics. Even if you're just making the coffee and shaking hands it's doing something for someone else and that will help when everything else fails.
