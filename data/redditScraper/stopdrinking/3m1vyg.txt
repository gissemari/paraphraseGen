Hey guys!! Hey guys!! Happy Wednesday! [It's hump day and it's fall!](https://vine.co/v/eUhUlKTwM2W)..Let's hump it out on this happy day! Hump days are when we calibrate our sobriety check in see how our /sd buds are doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations in the format below...**Triumph**: I had to have a difficult conversation with some family members that I was really trying to avoid. It's done - the message is conveyed. I'm glad about that. ..**Struggle**: The above conversations were really hard and certain people used the opportunity of me opening up to call me out on past behaviors. Like "how can we trust you on this when you used to be such a mess and really screwed things up for everyone?" (paraphrased of course).  It sucked and I hate being reminded that I don't have a great track record with my family. I'm stressing over it a bit but hey it is what it is. ..**General Chat**: The Pope's coming to visit us today! [Here's how I'll handle all the crazy traffic.](http://www.churchpop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/via-wheninmanila.com-1.jpg) Bars are opening early to accomodate all the "teleworkers" who are staying home to avoid the traffic. I'll be at work every day like the boss I am. :) What's the craziest your city's ever gone over a visiting dignitary? (Donald Trump doesn't count ha.)..More important how are you guys doing? How has this week been for you? Let us know your triumphs and struggles!
----------immediate responses--------

**Triumph**: Increasingly comfortable and confident with my sobriety. Doing some experiments to see what is really important but not taking risks...**Struggle**: My rotator cuff refuses to heal which prevents a lot of exercise options and greatly interferes with my sleep so two great benefits of sobriety are elusive...**General Chat**: The Packers beat the Seahawks. I am starting to like Fear the Walking Dead. Blind Spot sucked. I really need to finish painting my kitchen...
**Triumph:**  Back on my bike and bike commuting following a serious bike injury on 9/10;..**Struggle:**  Back on my bike and bike commuting following my bike injury and it's pretty hurt-y; ..**General Chat:**  Traffic sucks in Cleveland as the entire city roads and lanes are clogged by construction and re-routing due to some degree to the region's desire to impress the GOP next August when the National Convention is held here.  Frustrated motorists are using *bike lanes* to try to bypass backups and gridlocks.  Does it sound like I'm obsessing?
**Triumph:** I'm working again after persuading a client I could be trusted...**Struggle:** My mind keeps replaying stupid things I've done whilst drunk and it's showing no signs of giving me peace anytime soon...**General Chat:** I really need to be drinking more water rather than tea but can't seem to get into the habit (I just don't much like water).
Triumph: on the way home from my 2nd Smart recovery meeting a call went out for a bat rescue and I performed my first ever solo rescue. He was a beautiful grey headed flying fox exhuasted by a horrible storm today. No broken bones just weary. He is now resting in bat hospital...Struggle: my housemate seems to be possibly sliding in to coke addiction. We're not close enough for me to easily talk to him about it. It's anxiety producing at times. I have a plan but it still sucks - although selfishly it's also a good reminder of what I don't want for me...General chat: Ive been trialling Baclofen to help me with chronic joint pain. I can't remember the last time I slept this well with having a skinful of red wine beforehand! .Apparently Baclofen is being trialled for alcohol addiction too because of the link between anxiety and self medicating with grog. Interesting.
**Triumph**: Still sober! I'm still new enough yet far enough from my initial commitment that this feels like a triumph right now. No major cravings just still adjusting to sober life. Finally getting some increased motivation back too. Yay!..**Struggle**: Still working on the "now what?" thought process. How to create the life I want not just muddle through it. Feels discouraging sometimes...**Chat**: I went to see Obama a few years back when he came to town. It wasn't too crazy surprisingly. Hope your work day isn't too impacted by the Pope's visit. Interesting times we live in.
**Triumph:** I had a physical last week and my doctor said I'm in great shape. It also feels good to answer the how much alcohol do you drink question with none...**Struggle:** I took my dog to the vet last night and he basically said we've run out of options we're going to have to make a tough decision soon...**General Chat:** The craziest my city has gone for visiting dignitaries has to be the preparations for the G20 summit. The city turned into a military state and there were still riots and looting.
**Triumph:** Decided to turn my week or two off from drinking into a genuine change in my life...**Struggle:** Coming to terms with all of this.  Convincing myself that I have a snowball's chance in hell to succeed...**General chat:** Played soccer in my social league last night.  We lost but played well.  I took too long off from working out and got pretty out of shape but I enjoy the challenge of running up and down the field trying to keep up with people younger and in better shape than me.  
**Triumph:** Had a great couple day trip with the family. I even survived two days in close proximity to my step mom. It's good to see she is like "that" all the time and not just when she is around me...**Struggle:** Surviving two days in close proximity to my step mom wasn't easy. Feeling a little tired and drained today...**Chat:** I get to see some of the behind-the-scenes preparations for government visits. The Secret Service guys really do show up in suits and sunglasses.
Triumph: I did a couple of wall displays in my classroom. .Struggle: I'm very very low and have cried a lot this week. .
**T**: I had family come by for an unexpected overnight visit. Because I'm not drinking my Sunday away anymore the house was pretty clean and I had dinner on already! I wasn't dreading company...**S**: I've been really emotional this week; wanting to cry about everything good or bad. My memory has also been terrible!..**GC**: I've been dog sitting this week and it's so nice to have a pup around again. I can't wear Dansko clogs anymore. They are so stiff if I misstep I go down! I fell in front of some workers when walking said doggie today. Not hurt but annoyed at those shoes. I left them on the curb....
**Triumph**: I'm two days into my vacation and I couldn't have asked for better weather. I originally had plans to go camping but that fell through at the last minute so I've been relaxing harder than I've ever relaxed before. Lots of disc golf and video games and reading. Been playing with the pup a bunch and its really nice to think that she has never had to see me drunk. I got a raise at work and it seems like I'm actually starting to move up the ladder there. ..**Struggle**: The girl that I've been seeing lately totally screwed me on this vacation week. I'd been planning to go camping this week for the past 2 months and she said she would take me. Last minute and she got cold feet and gave me a lame excuse about school or something I think it was the last straw for me and I'm moving on. She's a great girl but I just get the feeling she's not ready for any kind of relationship which sucks but at least I'm figuring this out before it got too serious. I just wish she had told me she couldn't go from the get go so I wouldn't have planned my while vacation around it instead she waited till the day we were supposed to leave. Ughhhh. Oh well I'm still gonna enjoy my time off. ..**General Chat**: No one really cool ever comes to my Ohio city. I used to work at a Starbucks and we had a few celebrities come through. Martin Sheen stopped in a couple times super friendly guy also Jerry Springer. Didn't get to talk to him though. I see Dave Chapelle around occasionally but that's it. The pope would be a pretty cool guest. 
**Triumph:** Completed my assignment..**Struggle:** Thinking about decaffeinating myself..**General Chat:** A day late!
