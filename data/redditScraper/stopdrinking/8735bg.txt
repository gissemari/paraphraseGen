So I've ben lurking here for the past few months and started taking action in sobriety in earnest about 3 wks ago by attending SMART Recovery meetings...After a few weeks not drinking at all last Wednesday night my alcoholic mind decided a drink was a great way to celebrate my business partner and I closing an important client. So that turned into the next 4 nights polishing off a bottle of wine and then some. I'm awake now and 100% sober and just had an experience in changing habits I wanted to share...From SMART's cognitive behavioral training I know the old habits of drinking have a head start on building healthier habits over the past 3 weeks. However I smoke too and haven't been trying to quit until this just happened to me. I was about to walk out and enjoy a smoke with my roommate when the future played out in my mind of being grossed out by the aftertaste being winded if I went for a run later and the stimulant response I'd get on a day I'm dedicating to relaxing at a spa. It hit me so clearly how this short-term trigger/response habit wasn't serving my long-term goals of enjoying this nice day and keeping myself healthy. I turned around grabbed a La Croix instead to serve my spa plans and keep me well hydrated. ..It was a nice glimpse at how being aware of my thoughts could stop addictive habits in their tracks. I'm glad to be back in the right mindset to end this relapse (all be it 4 days) and get back on the sobriety train! ..If you're struggling today just remember to slow down the mind when you feel those urges and ask yourself if it serves your longer term goals with that 1 drink or is it just your alcoholic mind trying to serve itself? Going to try to take my own advice the next time I notice an urge to drink to celebrate/unwind/be social. ..Stay strong out there! IWNDWYT!

Great post. 'Playing the tape forward' has saved my @$$ many times from relapse. Glad to hear you have it figured out and IWNDWYT.
