I posted my story on day one and here I am after 30 full days (31 at around 11:30 tonight) literally LIVING THE DREAM! No hangovers extra money in my wallet every week more quality time with my daughter rediscovered hobbies and passions....there have been so many positive changes thus far that I get legitimately excited to see what the next day/week/month will bring. My counselors my friends and family and THIS SUB have helped me along so much so THANK YOU! ..I will not drink with you today. For those that are struggling...you CAN do this. One minute at a time one second at a time if need be.

Congratulations! I am also starting to rediscover hobbies and I'm enjoying the moments around me so much more. Also isn't it wonderful to feel proud of yourself?! I've felt shame guilt and hate for myself for so long. Now? I'm so proud of myself so grateful for what I'm doing I'm falling in love with myself again. I hope you feel those things too. Today I won't drink for both of us :) 
Congratulations! Getting past that first month is huge.
