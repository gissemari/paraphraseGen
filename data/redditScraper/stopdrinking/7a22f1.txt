Hi all! I've been lurking on SD for a while and am finally getting the courage to post. I'm on day 4 of sobriety. I had previously made it 17 days but had a relapse during a happy hour that I had planned before I realized that I was an alcoholic and that I wanted to quit drinking. ..I'm not sure how to articulate what's going on in my head. I have almost no support from my friends. I do have support from my family. But I hear things like:. - everyone in their 20s drinks to excess . - I'm sure some day you'll be able to moderate it again . - I had to stop drinking for my medication and I thought I'd miss it but I don't. ..It just is frustrating to have to try and explain to non-addicts that there voice in my head is different from theirs. I used to call that voice in my head the "party monster". Once she had a drink it was all over. Now I know it's a monster for sure but not a party one. She's an addict. ..To top it off I'm in a situation where I'll be in a bar for the next 6 weeks. I paid for an activity and have a group of people relying on me. I can't bail. So I guess I'm just asking for support. I'm done drinking. I don't want to drink tonight at the bar but focus on the activity and fun. So I'm committing to you all here.

Hi..Some ideas I have used.  Have a job that requires a lot of travel.  As such I spend a lot of time around alcohol; bars airport lounges flights after work dinner party's etc. I have survived Oktoberfest in Germany many cocktail meetings and a whisky party in Japan.  Best advice I can give you is to focus on your own choice; people around you will drink and be drunk.  Enjoy drinking non alcoholic beverages and try to keep involved in some conversations and have fun.  I always try to have a drink in my hand (somehow it helps) and drink soda water and some fruit juice.  I really enjoy waking up in the mornings not feeling like hell and try to get to the gym. I will not drink with you today or this week as I am again getting ready for another trip :).
Thank you all for the support! I did not drink tonight although my karaoke performance probably sounded better to people who did! I made it another day without drinking. I'm so grateful for that.
