I don't have any recent alcoholic horror stories.  My "rock bottom" was fairly anti-climactic but rock bottom is whenever you decide to quit digging...I am a 30 year old stay at home mom of two tots; educated high functioning sneaky and sly.  I was going through 5-6 bottles of wine per week which may not seem like much to the seasoned alcoholic but it's excessive for me (5'5 105 lbs).  But this is more about why I was drinking in the first place and the secretive behavior that came with it...I didn't drink and drive I'm not an angry drunk.  I have gotten a bit too silly and chatty (and perhaps a bit shit-talky at times) and thus embarrassed myself at a neighbor's BBQ or dinner party here and there but nothing classically indicitive that I have a problem with alcohol. ..I'm not even sure I'm an alcoholic. I'm not committed to giving up wine forever but right now I am reaching for a substance to avoid dealing with my issues.  And as long as I'm doing that I'm not using the necessary coping skills I will need to teach my kids as they grow up...I realized during my last hangover that I don't have these coping skills yet.  ..6 days sober and I already feel much better.  Sounds weird but there was something strangely satisfying about having clear odorless urine the past few days.  Makes me wonder what my previous levels of toxicity were...I had a few triggers this week:.1. Disagreement with my husband.2. Watching people sip wine on TV.3. Cooking!.4. Money problems..Ive managed to avoid the drink each time so far.  There is a nearly empty bottle of my favorite Sauvignon Blanc in the fridge and it brings me comfort to know it is there and that I don't want it...I kept my excessive drinking a secret from my husband- who occasionally drinks but has never been drunk never smoked a cigarette never got a tattoo- a very straight edge in control type of guy who does not understand addiction but was with me through an addiction to marijuana when we met and stood by me while I struggled to give it In order to be with him.  ..I didn't tell him I was concerned about my drinking because I was afraid he would lose respect for me. I was afraid he would worry about me on top of the copious amount of stress he is already under...Last night I came clean to him and admitted that I had been secretly drinking and hiding the evidence.  He was loving and kind.  ..It's our secrets that keep us sick.

Interesting story. I found out a lot about myself when I quit. I have quit before and seem to be able to at will. But I need to find that moment when stopping  makes sense. What I have learned is the best version of me is one that does not drink. Here it is Friday and I would be pretty hammered right now. Do I miss it. Sometimes I do but its easier for me to stay sober then to stop drinking. It certainly is a decision you will have to make on your own. Time will tell. I also found so many more positives then negatives with quiting booze. Glad you made it here 6 days is a great start. Hang tight I think you are going to see great things for yourself as time ticks by. I know I did. Good Luck!
Great work and congratulations on now I suspect 7 days!..You've got the recipe:  it's just One day...Your sober you is your Best You for your kids spouse and for YOU!..Just for Today I Don't Drink with You...
