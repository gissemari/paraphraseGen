Just wanted to check in to let those who are earlier in this know that I am 69 days in and still loving it. Biggest boosts as of late. Went to driving range for first time ever with soon to be in-laws. Stayed sober and did not embarrass myself and actually did pretty well. Would not have let myself risk this when I was still drinking -- learning something in front of others that requires eye/hand coordination would NOT have happened even if blasted. Also -- I do struggle with thoughts that I am not good enough but a huge source of shame and guilt is no longer badgering me! Not drinking with you all today!

&gt; a huge source of shame and guilt is no longer badgering me..very inspiring post thank you for sharing! Not drinking with you today!
I came to think of drinking as a part-time job. Being drunk and hungover - and _prepared_ as you describe - took so much effort. Good riddance. I have so much more time and energy without it.
Good for you! If you did pretty well at the driving range for your first time then you must be a natural. Be careful though my husband got me into golf about 6 years ago and now I'm hooked lol. And the shallow side of me gave up drinking because I was worried that it was affecting my putting lol.
