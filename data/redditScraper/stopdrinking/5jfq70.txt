I was sure it will be a matter of one day or two - or one week at maximum! Now it has been 4 weeks and I have a nasty hangover from yesterday. I really miss my healthy looking skin and productive mornings. I had more cigarettes yesterday than I had in a month when I was sober. The fact that I can not stop is the best reason for stopping! ..The good news is that for the first time in my live I have looked up the info local AA it is not far and I will go tomorrow. I will let you know how it went please be with me.
