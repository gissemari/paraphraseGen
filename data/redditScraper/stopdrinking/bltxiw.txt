Today is one whole year of sobriety and I'm very happy to be at this point.  I've focused on one day at a time and it's pretty amazing to step back and look at the big picture every once in a while...&amp;#x200B;..One year under my belt means I've tackled all of the events that were hard for me to imagine doing without alcohol such as my birthday birthdays of friends the holiday season New Year's football season baseball season camping season stressful days at work relaxing days of vacation and everything in between...&amp;#x200B;..After a year I'm thrilled to say that every aspect of my life is better - my mental health my financial health and of course my physical health.  I've saved so much money been more productive my decision making and problem solving is more clear my confidence is at an all time high and I've lost weight with other physical improvements too.  Sobriety has been the best decision of my life and I've never been more optimistic about the future...&amp;#x200B;..For those who know what I'm talking about - thank you for sharing your stories and helping me get to this point.  So many of you have helped me through sharing your struggles and successes and you've helped me realize I'm not alone...&amp;#x200B;..For those considering quitting - I never thought there was life after booze and I can't believe how wrong I was.  The only regret I have is not doing it sooner but we're all on different paths and only each of us know when the time is right for ourselves to make the change...&amp;#x200B;..Thanks for reading and best wishes to all of you.
