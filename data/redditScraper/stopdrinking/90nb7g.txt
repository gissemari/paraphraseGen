Celebrating 8 months today.  So proud of myself considering Ive lost ppl to this disease.  They did not have the help I had.   . Here's what worked for me: Working an AA program (I took what worked for me and left out all the rest) Let go of all old friends and got new sober positive friends.  Built a new life and life style of walking yoga and gym.  I did 3+ years of good 'ol therapy - it helped heal me.   Did lots of inner child work reading writing.  I kept an open mind with doing the 12 steps with the big book and a very cool sponsor.  I learned more about myself while learning about my disease - my disease (as treacherous as it was aftermath and all) ultimately became a gift that freed me from a life of trauma and pain.  I no longer have to numb my childhood wounds...I no longer have to be around not so healthy people.  I have a new amazing life now. I love my new life and wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.  My worst day sober is still 1000 better than my best day drinking.  There's a light in the entire tunnel; its called sobriety - its getting support from ppl who actually love and care about you.  My tribe is sober my tribe is a personal choice; one I consciously and ruthlessly chose. For MYSELF. For my future.  I didn't get sober on my own - and I no longer look at that as a weakness.  I am so grateful I have amazing sober conscious loving intelligent happy productive people in my life.  Sober alcoholics are some of the strongest kick ass people I know - I honestly would not have it any other way.   Next week - I get to celebrate all my hard work with a trip to my fav destination - So happy to be happy and well today.  IWNDWUT.   Thanks everyone on reddit who helped along the way.  And to anyone who may be struggling - try the methods I mentioned...I promise you it will click in.  Its not a one time fix all solution - its a lifestyle...one that you will enjoy once you notice the benefits from the change.  Change is hard - but its worth witnessing for yourself.  :)  (AND YES...LIFE IS TOTALLY FUN SOBER! SO NOT BORING!  You eventually get to do all the things you want to do....fall in love have friends who love you learn to love yourself lose those 10 pounds take yourself on holidays get that dream career etc....Work hard and give it time!) BE gentle with yourself!)  hugs.
