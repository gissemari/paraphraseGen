I'm not going to go into a ton of detail about my drinking habits on this post. I've covered it on previous posts. So let me give you the short-short version: I work a very stressful job and have chronic insomnia issues which led to a pretty bad habit of binge drinking. I've never been addicted to alcohol but I used it to solve other issues in my life and I became unhappy with the way I was using it. ..Anyway come January I decided I'd do Dry January. I wanted to see if it was difficult for me and I wanted to experience life as I lived it before age 21. ..Well it was WEIRD to not drink habitually but it was wonderful. As the days went on I felt less and less strange about not drinking. I actually *thought* about it less. It's started to become more of a habit for me now. I'm used to it...Yesterday I was going out to dinner with my sister and my husband and I asked myself "Do I want to have some wine?" My Dry January was over after all...And I surprised myself. My answer was 'no'. ..I still don't know what my relationship with alcohol looks like down the road. What I DO know is that I feel so much better without drinking. I have more energy and I feel happier. I haven't lost any significant amount of weight (but I've always been skinny anyway). But I thought to myself "If I have one glass I'll invariably want another after that. And pretty soon I'll be back in my old habits. I don't want my old habits back."..I was sick of spending money on alcohol...I was sick of not facing my problems constructively...I was sick of feeling tired and giving up hobbies because I was too busy drinking...Mostly I was sick of waking up feeling like death from the night before. You know that feeling like your face is slowly falling off? The disorientation upon awakening? The vague memories of watching TV shows you don't even like? The realization that you went to bed without brushing your teeth or taking your clothes off because you just passed out?..I feel better. My skin is better. I am happier. I am finally beginning to pick up my hobbies again (reading and making music) that I left behind for years because alcohol was taking their place. I still struggle with insomnia but I am working with a therapist on this. Oh yeah I started seeing a therapist instead of turning to alcohol to cope!..This sub has been amazing. So many positive stories and so many people being frank about their struggles on some days. I've lurked here so much it's been terrifically helpful...What's next for me with alcohol? I don't know. But I know that in the foreseeable future I will not be drinking. Life is too good right now...Thank you r/stopdrinking! IWNDWYT!
