.So here's my deal. Been lurking on Reddit subs for quite some time now but just recently discovered this thread and figured if nothing else I could reach out to this community without judgement..Basically I have been a terrible alcoholic/addict since I was a teenager. It's been such a big part of my adult life now that I simply cannot imagine life without alcohol playing a part in it. It's become my job(I work in a fancy scotch bar) and it's also become my indentity in that I always party/socialize with people in the industry in my city now and I'm not sure how to get away from things even if I wanted to..Recently things have been getting worse again ( I feel like I go through waves of manageable to bad with my drinking). Nothing like life threatening or anything but when I go on a bad episode I'm not taking care of myself I'll get super drunk and black out and fall and hurt myself accidentally leave my keys in my front door etc. I know I'm an alcoholic and I'm open about it- it doesn't come as a surprise to me or anyone that knows me. I feel like overall I've finally learned more or less to not get too sloppy(working in a bar supriaingly helped with that) but that's obviously not always the case. Not to mention I'm a girl and it takes an obscene amount of hard spirits just to get me buzzed. In one way it's good in another way it's kind of terrifying. Has anyone else ever had their entire identities wrapped up in alcohol and looked for or found a reprieve? I guess I'm just looking for other folks who are/have gone through similar situations for support. Most of my friends have no idea that I'm as bad off as I am but I know the truth of it and I feel like if I don't change something soon it's only going to get worse....I feel like I should also add that I've been to AA and rehab before (granted rehab was back when I was 21 and stupid and I cheated the whole way through it).AA was beneficial for me in some ways especially since I started going not soon after I relocated to a new city and didn't know people but my biggest issue with AA is that despite having gone to many different kinds of meetings it seems to have all been coming back to Christian based beliefs which I just cannot get behind.....Anyway feedback or just any kind of advice is very much welcomed and appreciated. It would be a huge help to talk to some like minded people who are going through similar struggles....thanks folks :)

Sorry for your struggles. It sounds like you're in a tough spot. I have found smartrecovery.org to be quite helpful. It is more science and self managemennt based. I wish you the best. Keep coming back. There's alot of wisdom here... :) 
Welcome! My identity was wrapped up in aclohol - it was front and centre of my life. Until one day I decided it wasn't going to get any better I had a problem and I needed to stop. It's taken extended sober time and reflecting on posts here daily but my identity and thoughts on alcohol are completely different these days I've become a non-drinker and discovered a sober life that Im determined to hold onto. I am done drinking my life away.
