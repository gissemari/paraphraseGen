just got back from spring break at my folks place. went to basically all the places i used to get wasted at. the ski resort i worked at. the golf course i used to feel at home at. my favorite restaurant which also contained my favorite bar...my dad and family are all high class winos who all eat fancy food and wine as their hobby...i was presented a chance to have a glass of some 250 dollar a bottle Joseph phelps insignia and turned it down. didnt even taste it...i never abused wine like that  liquor was my toxin of preference. but as a chef this little voice in my head kept telling me take a sip its not booze its a gourmet flavor. do it for your pallet not your liver...i still didnt. ive been having a tough time recently with some mental health issues and i was put to the test everyday for a whole week over spring break and didnt touch anything...it was shocking to see how different the world i used to live in was through sober eyes. none of the things i went and did seemed the same sober. im glad i moved away...all my friends are still putting on weight hemorrhaging money and digging themselves in deeper...it amazing how much of a difference getting soner has made in my life. ive made more progress since i got sober than i did in my entire life before...i have this subreddit and the people who have reached out to me and commiserated with me when times were tough. i finally no longer feel scared that i will fuck up and relapse. it took a while but i finally believe in myself that i can stay sober...thank you to all. every one of you. i couldn't have done it without you. god this sounds gay lmfao but seriously.. i was too introverted to get real help and AA was too religous for me..IWNDWYT!
