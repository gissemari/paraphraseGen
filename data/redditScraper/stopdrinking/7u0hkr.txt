I wasted so many months trying to find the "perfect" moment to quit. I wanted that moment to be profound. I wanted it to be dramatic and meaningful like a powerful scene in an engrossing movie..Well in a way it was just that. A movie. An illusion in my head. In reality this never worked out for me as I would always end up trying to find that "perfect" moment again and again relapsing and having hundreds of "last drinks". It seems strange looking back on it but I feel like I somehow became addicted to the act of quitting itself. The act of making promises to both yourself and those around you the sadomasochistic ambivalence of both the torture and the pleasure of having that last drink ever..If you are stuck in that cycle yourself and catch yourself wondering whether to drink or not here is my advice for you: **Don't wait for the perfect moment to get sober.** There will never be a perfect time and even if you got close to one in your mind that would only give you an excuse to repeat the experience potentially leading into this hellish cycle of not being able to stop but constantly trying....Instead focus on breaking the cycle in the present moment. I remember vividly how when the thought first came to me it was so simple yet so profound that I still find myself smiling right now as I type this. We keep worrying so much about our future that we forget this basic truth of life: **The only time you can truly control your actions is the present!**.*Any goal you want to achieve has to start with a conscious action in the present moment. There is really no way around it*. You can't expect anything to ever magically just change by constantly thinking about it and wishing for it to happen. Instead focus on what really matters! What can you do right now to reach your goal and beat your inner demons? .No matter how small the action - do it and do it consciously. Know that it takes you closer to being where you want to be.. *Clean your house. Read a chapter of that book that's been sitting on your shelf collecting dust for the past years. Stretch for 5 minutes.* Hell if you don't have time for that: *Wash your face.* It almost seems like the simpler the action the better it is. *But it has to be deliberate!*...As I type these last few words I feel a sense of growing contentment in me. What do you feel? Did you even notice that you breathed just now? Did you notice that you blinked a moment ago up until I mentioned it to you? You probably did know that but chances are you were not really aware of it as it happened. **Keep it simple and focus on the present moment.**..I hope this post has been helpful insightful maybe even inspiring to you and I thank you for reading it :D It is my deliberate and conscious action for today...*What will be yours? :)*

Thank you for this
**Do it *now*.**    .Well said! One day at a time one hour at a time one minute at a time one second at a time. Daily meditation has helped me realize breathing is important at any time of the day. Clipping my fingernails tying my shoes drinking my coffee doing the dishes...and *not drinking*. Mindfulness works for all moments.
Yep.  Right here right now!
Very inspiring - thank you!  
Exactly what the dr.ordered...or what I needed to readthank you.i have wanted a certain date or numbers for my quitting date ...then I give in and and wait til the next good date or event..crazy! Mentally this has been self abusive and so stupid when I step back and think about that..forward we go! The present moment is a gift for sure.
Well said OP. If you're making excuses your just kidding yourself and maybe need more help. 
There is magic in the air again I can feel it!    ..**A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step**..This morning I was having visions about conscious actions I will be taking at work.. not regarding my job per se but regarding the social aspects of it.  I have plans that require awareness and many micro decisions to participate in a way that encourages more lightheartedness there... it seems to be a running theme of some bickering as my bosses are like a grumpy old married couple together and the three of us work very closely all day long.. I see how I can begin to lighten things up on my end instead of feeling dragged down about it    there are ways... !  ..It's a great day to be alive   .I will show my appreciation for a great day by not drinking with you today.  
I needed to read this today. I fell off last night and I've been dwelling all morning. This shut that down time to make decisions for NOW.
Before I stopped for this current long stretch I made many attempts at taking a month off but they rarely happened because I would try to time it so that there were no big drinking events in that month. ..I would have been better off choosing not to drink in a month that there WERE big drinking events in so that I could learn to handle them and have fun without alcohol. 
Thank you for this post. It's very eye opening and somewhat comforting to know I'm not alone in this "quitting cycle" that I torture myself with every 3 to 4 days.

Right NOW is the moment...I am moving to another country in 2 weeks so I was thinking that I better quit when I'm totally settled because otherwise it would be too stressful. But I'll tell you what. It was all an excuse of my addicted mind. ALWAYS is a perfect time to quit. If you don't do it now chances are you will always find excuses to pospone it. 
Thank you. I really needed this too. Today is Day 3 but I am not meeting my new sponsor to kick things off until tomorrow night. It's the perfect time that I would justify one last hurrah. ..I reminded myself earlier today that the last 2 times I had a "last hurrah" I ended up drunk for a week straight and spent over $500 on booze and junk food each time. 
I've always kept thinking "just that one party I've been invited to that looks good" and "I'll do it once I finish my bachelors!" and "once my friends move away I'll get sober friends!" but then I had the worst hangover last Sunday and I was just like yeah no this has to happen right now.
I agree! I was so scared of withdrawing again and I had just lost my insurance so I kept telling myseld I'd taper. That was cute. Cue me drinking almost a litre a day of any kind of booze I could get my hands on. I became incredibly withdrawn and anxious and I started buying booze ahead of time. The first day of January I went to the doctor to help safely withdraw. ..So excites to finally be the girl I used to be. Don't wait.
