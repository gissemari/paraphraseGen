And worried about tonight. I've been lurking around for a while now and have been drawing a lot of inspiration and motivation from reading everyone's posts. I think I just need to introduce myself/reaffirm why I need to get and stay sober. ..I tried in January. Started the weekend after my engagement party. I had spent the whole weekend chasing after booze. I hurt my fianc  because he felt like I wasn't interested in him. And frankly I wasn't; I was more interested in drinking and partying. I spent Sunday and Monday hungover. I had to skip work. Until that point I never had to stay home because of my drinking. I hated it. ..I relapsed. Not hard just some drinks here and there. Then my fianc  visited his family over Easter and I was home alone and I could not stop. I told myself two glasses of wine and then the next thing I know I'm drunk and I'm a version of myself that I hate. I woke up with my heart racing and couldn't go back to sleep because I wracked with guilt. I still didn't stop. ..Last week I did it again. I stayed home from work again because of my hangover. I slept in late woke up cried and dealt with the guilt of failing my self and my fianc . And then I pulled this sub up again and read posts and looked for advice. I'm currently working through This Naked Mind...Tonight I'm meeting a friend for dinner. She doesn't know about my problem. I'm worried I won't be able to resist the temptation. I'll tell myself one glass will be fine. And then I'll go home and search for something else anything else because it can never be just one. But I'm going to give it my all and resist the temptation. I will order a sparkling water instead. ..I'm committed to this. I need to do this for me and for my relationship. So I guess I just wanted to say hi and that you all are so motivating and that I hope I can draw on the strength you guys show through your posts. ..I won't drink with you tonight.

Me? I wouldn't go to dinner. On day 4 I was still detoxing...Wishing you the best.
Day 4 was the hardest for me.  I was feeling better and I would talk myself in to just having one which was never just one.  If you must go tonight here is what I would do... drink lots of water or better yet eat before heading out.  Hunger is a huge trigger!  Check in here if you are feeling weak.  Good luck!!!
