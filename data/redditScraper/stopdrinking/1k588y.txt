I went to an event and tasted beer. I had a good time but I still broke a promise to myself. ..A positive out of this is that I went twenty three days without a drink so the breaks are getting longer. Plus it was a special event that can be easily avoided in the future. ..

There will always be another special event. The more you want a drink the easier they are to find. 
Keep in mind that repeated relapse/withdrawal cycles are not healthy:  [kindling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindling_%28substance_withdrawal%29)...Another reason to use this slip as a lesson to learn from and not an excuse for even more drinking.
What was the reason you didn't avoid it this time? ..Not to "cry over splled milk" but examine thinking.
You can't lose what you don't have. Did you relapse? Were you working a program? Sometimes we use this word "relapse" when we haven't actually given ourselves to the program. I "relapsed" every 3 days for 2 years because I always swore off drugs and alcohol after every binge. Today I realized that I wasn't sober I was dry or in denial and still out there testing my allergy trying to find some self control... I never found it. It was only through going to meetings (not drinking in between) working steps putting the pen to paper getting a sponsor doing service work and maintaining a healthy body mind and spirit that I was able to avoid another "relapse."
You bent but didn't break. A taste is ok (I mean in this case no real harm done) it can trigger but you did it dude! I know you feel guilty and I understand the guilt of breaking a promise to yourself but I would still like to congratulate you on your strength and fortitude. Keep going hun :).
