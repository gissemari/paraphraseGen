Last night I relapsed and had two beers. I told myself I would only have two beers and that's it. Of course after I finished my second beer I immediately thought about going to get more. For 5 minutes I had a war in my mind. But then something occurred to me similar to becoming lucid in a dream when you break out of your previously unconscious behavior and enter a state of higher thinking. ..&amp;#x200B;..Why did I want MORE? My buzz was already totally euphoric yet for some reason I was discontent and was straight tripping about wanting more. Why? Why would I be discontent despite how good I actually felt? I realized I'm not actually addicted to the euphoria as much as I am addicted to running away. ..&amp;#x200B;..I used to think I drank to "live in the moment" but now I'm realizing I have been afraid of the present moment this whole time. I can see it in the smallest things. Instead of being ok with just existing my mind will start thinking about random shit to distract from the moment. Social media food internet drugs (alcohol in this case) shopping ruminating about random shit are all things society uses to distract from the present moment. ..&amp;#x200B;..So instead of getting more beer I just sat with how I felt in the moment. Instead of getting carried away by my thoughts I watched them. I then peacefully fell asleep and woke up feeling refreshed and grateful for my realization (and subsequently the lack of the hangover I would have had). I feel like I will never be the same.

Sounds like an awakening that will help lead you on the path of sobriety. Iwndwy!
I couldn't have written that better myself.  I'm best off having none.  I can't just have 2 no matter what I tell myself.
