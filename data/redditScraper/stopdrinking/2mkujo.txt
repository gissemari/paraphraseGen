Hi folks- I've been reading this sub for months now and decided today is the day i stop lurking!..To make a very long story short I managed to stay sober for almost 6 years with no help. I was even in training to be an addiction adviser. I was probably over confident in that i hated the drunk version of myself so much i was sure i'd never drink again. I guess it became a big part of my identity the one thing i was sure of in life. My proudest achievement...Well last April it all fell apart. In hindsight there were warning signs and the mental health issues i struggle with went into overdrive. I had some ridiculous level depression due to heartbreak and drank again. Since then I've been stop-starting on soberiety weeks on and off.  Resetting the counter over and over. The whole process has been soul destroying but lately something has clicked and i know i can return to sober me ( or a better version of- the more i think on it there was probably a 'dry drunk' element. Also i hid indoors a lot and was isolated during those 6 years to cope).I've finally stopped beating myself up about the failure. This time round i know i will probably need some support. I'm very glad that this community exists.

Hello. I'm glad you decided to come out of the shadows. I could not stay sober on my own. I was not strong enough or smart enough. Treatment a therapist and AA laid the foundation for a lifetime of recovery. I hope you get the support you need and deserve. 
Welcome /u/semisorry -- I normally leave newcomers my ["Baby Steps"](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) but in your case I'm [also linking you to my "Saturday Share" post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/25u6cc/saturday_share_im_coolcrosby_and_i_am_an_alcoholic/)  It describes my life after relapse.  I'm glad you made it back.
&gt; I've finally stopped beating myself up about the failure. ..This is a big key if you ask me. Forgive yourself. We are all just human prone to mistakes and bad choices. Recognizing that and reaching out to other people has helped me...Congrats on your new start. Make it your last new start.
I'm very glad you are back.   I also fell apart after 9 months and it sucked.   I promise you that your soul is not destroyed though.  It's buried under some crap and you can dig it out. 
The best support you can get is in real life and it is usually free.  I would definately check out a meeting.  It may be the key to stopping for good.  Good luck.
Thanks guys! It's odd to think I've had more knowledgeable support on here today than in person over the last few years. Finding like minded people/meetings should help this time around. I'm seeing a therapist but not as often as i'd like. .All we can do is learn from failure.. I was mad at myself for most of last year which led to a whole vicious cycle of drinking as 'it was all i deserved' etc. madness! Living with a friend who has similar issues has made it harder at times but it can't be an excuse (when i first got sober i was around drinkers/ social events a lot and managed). .It's been a hard lesson but the perspective gained means i know what i'm up against. The worst case scenario i could imagine has happened and i'm still alive. Feeling optimistic again. Taking it a day at a time.
