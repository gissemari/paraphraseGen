Well I finally did. I finally finished my taxes it took five days. Not because they were extremely hard but they were pretty stressful. So I did as much as I could and then took a break and picked it back up the next day. Thank you for all the advice and talking to me through them! It was very helpful.....Here is [photos](http://imgur.com/a/gLtSD) inspirational/motivating quotes and such I looked at while I was taking my break and procrastinating. It is a lot just a heads up.....Thanks for getting me through this fellow Sobernauts....High Five
