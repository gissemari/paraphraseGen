I stopped drinking at the end of May 2014. As the summer went on and I figured out what not-drinking would look like for me there were three upcoming events that I worried would especially challenge my tenuous sobriety...Those events were in September and October of 2014. I've been thinking a lot about them and comparing this summer to that summer. Comparison is something I try not to do because it brings up lots of regrets. Occasionally it is important to see how far we've come...The first was my brothers wedding. The second was a big international conference that happens every two years. The third was an annual conference I help organize. All three events were usually alcohol-soaked--well it was my brother's first wedding but you know what I mean--and focused around drinking. I could not imagine how i would be able to get through them...* I focused on my motivation.  .* I prepared. I made plans contingency plans and emergency contingency plans.  .* I made myself accountable to other sober people. I relied on SD (and made some strong connections as a result).  .* I struggled...**I succeeded.**..My brother just celebrated his second anniversary. Now I'm remembering the trip fondly. Euphoric recall is not always a problem...This year I'm part of the organizing committee for the international meetings. It's stressful as hell but I'm not worried about drinking. We've tacked our annual conference onto the international one so I get one ten- day lump of conference organization instead of two rounds. ..I'm beginning my preparations now several weeks in advance. The list of struggles is very different that it was 2 years ago. I expect both the struggle and the success to be easier.

Awesomeness! Congratulations on your success!
That must feel great to have enough time between these big events to see clear markers of success.  Congratulations!
