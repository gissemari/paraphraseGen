I've thrown everything possible at staying sober the past 101 days. I have to say that this online community was/is extremely helpful in my choice to stay sober. Today at my group meeting - we did a relapse prevention exercise and listed the "mooring line behaviors". I listed /r/SD as one of my top relapse prevention techniques. There's been some negativity lately in this forum and I just wanted to post a positive note on what SD has been for me. Full disclosure that I attend AA and other groups but SD has and will continue to be a positive influence on my abstinence from alcohol. Without blowing too much smoke up people's asses - a special thanks to the mods that keep this place as it should be: a place for redditors to motivate each other to control or stop drinking. I know of another individual who is now at 7 months (and going) sober that used SD as well. In AA we say keep coming back and I feel the same rings true here. If you are serious about controlling or stopping drinking - this place can work for you. Read. Ask. Comment. Share. It takes all walks of sobriety to pull together the pieces that help you and there's rarely a place like SD where you have such an eclectic conglomerate. 101 Dalmatians so to speak. If you're new or seasoned here - I hope you can use this subreddit as a valuable tool in your arsenal like I have. Thanks.

Let me be the first to second that. Bravo.
Hear hear!
Agreed! Another tool in my arsenal. Love it. Congratulations on your 101.
Hey very well said so thank you. This place has been a lifeline &amp; a Godsend I would not have made it to even 3 days without it that's for SURE. Still a long road ahead but I feel like all you awesome people will help me get there. Congratulations on 101 days too - go you!
