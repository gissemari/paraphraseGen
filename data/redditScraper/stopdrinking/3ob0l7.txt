I am certain that the feeling will return but for the last couple weeks I haven't had an urge. ..It gets better. For everyone struggling tonight I promise you that there will come a day or two when you don't miss it anymore. At least not at that moment...I love you all.

thank you
I think I have some kind Pavlonian aversion to alcohol now after getting sick from it so many times. This is similar to how I quit smoking because I find zero value in it and only disguist.
Enjoy the feeling now! I would use the memories of these feelings when having a rough time reminding myself that urges and feelings will pass.
