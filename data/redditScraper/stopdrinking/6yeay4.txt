Well I am on day two of my taper and this time it is not going as well as it has in the past. This last relapse has been a really bad one as underneath everything I sense more of a destructive tone.....as if I can drink the pain of not only losing my son (who I had already lost in the 1980's when his father disappeared with him when he was still a toddler) but my beloved daughter who I love most deeply. I won't go into what happened but it has effected me more than I care to admit. My husband isn't a father so he has no idea how it feels. So I speak to NOBODY about it. I feel isolated in the middle of nowhere in a state I swore I would never return to (I knew my abusive ex-husband and very angry ex-felon son were still living here) and I am still unhealed spiritually from losing my father to cancer in 2012 and in dealing with his estate I lost the rest of the family because of in fighting over money and land. We are not very forgiving people and with the end of the probate (it took a miserable 5 years) in June I know I will never see most of them ever again. Depressing as all get out...I have to go to work today. I have never wished for a sit down in front of a computer job more than I do right now...but I actively see and perform tests on patients...eye exams basically. The taper is not working out this time and I have never EVER drank at or before I have gone to work....not once in the entire 17 years......so I am REALLY worried how long I will be able to go without showing outward signs of withdrawal. I cannot just not go. I have missed two weeks already. Luckily I only work two days a week and after today I don't go back until Friday. I tried calling my GP yesterday but I was 20th in line and after 30 minutes of the "line" not really changing I hung up. I will call my insurance company today to see what my options are. This time I very well may need a medical detox. I already have the shakes my stomach hurts like hell and I KNOW I have a swollen liver.....probably have had one since the kids vandalized our home in May. (Kids....they are aged 3o and 24....)..I know ya'll are getting tired of reading my crap....but this time I am scared. THIS time I am 100% sure that if I relapse again I might as well just resign myself to a horrible and early death. I know this because my mother is 68 years old has SEVERE health problems and she still calls me drunk as a skunk (She did just a few days ago). My brother died in 2008 from his alcoholism. He was 38 years old. This is a depressing thought..Alcohol has taken SO much from me and the stupid thing is I let it....I am the one who allowed something as stupid as alcohol to take everything I had ever built for myself...away..So here I sit at 1am in the morning with a swollen belly gurgling bowels and a desire for alcohol a pill.....anything to take this agitation away...anything to make this realization go away that I AM in a maze of my own construct but I am too terrified to even begin to find my way out..Right now I have money in the bank. I could feasibly not work for a couple of years and still get by (unless my husband left me...then things would change). I have worked in my line of work for 30 years and have totally burned out. The only reason I am working in it now is because I just got tired of looking for jobs at age 50 where nobody was interested in a washed out over qualified medical technician. So why am I so worried about a job I have only worked at since July and one where I only work 2 days a week anyway..At any rate I HAVE to try and go back to sleep. The blessing in all this right now is that I live in the middle of nowhere so I cannot drive easily to a liquor store or grocery store like I could in Chicago AND I do not keep liquor in the house...and as for the taper I should have been down to 2 by now and I got stuck at 6....this never happened to me before so I am pretty worried.....thanks for reading another one of my long boring MEMEMEMEMEME posts......

I feel for you on every level. I think seeing a doctor as soon as you can (ER?) is your best option to start coping mentally and physically with your losses and your addiction. Life is hard. Harder for many of us. I don't know why that is but you're still here and trying in spite of all your significant heartache. Keep going. We are all rooting for you. 
Keep trying to give up the booze sounds like you've had a rough ride I haven't got much advice to offer but it can't be nice being in your position.  I hope you get sorted and get some help take care!
