God I'm such a moron I can't stop drinking.  I was tested 6 months ago when I was still drinking and all my levels were fine.  Now suddenly the past three days I've had non stop twitches and sudden muscle jerks in my left arm that occurs a few times eveeh minute.  Of course I play google doctor and what does it say?  Kidney failure.  I'm going to get blood work done but this has me so scared...Can I ask you kind folks what your BUN levels were near when you first stopped drinking or even if you've had blood work done after relapsing?  I'm such a idiot I'm too young at 33 I don't want to leave my wife and family.

If you were really worried and are having those kind of feelings right now you could just go to an urgent care to talk about it. When you are stressed your mind is going to go to the worst places. And electrolyte imbalance is not something I would play around with so if it were me I would see the doctor.
You're not an idiot but you maybe an addict. Like other's say here go to Urgent care or the ER and be honest with what is going on. Don't play doctor it will just up your anxiety. If you don't want work to know the reason make up something and go. It seems to me your life is more important than having a call out from work. Wellness to you friend. Take care.
