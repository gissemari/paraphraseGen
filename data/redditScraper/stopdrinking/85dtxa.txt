75 days feels pretty surreal. This is the longest I've gone without booze since I started drinking at 15. I'm feeling great overall!..However I am irritated with friends today. We were supposed to see a movie but plans fell apart because one of my pals is supposedly hungover. I could have made plans to see family or go to an event but had to book the middle of the afternoon for this. There's not much I can do to salvage this day...I don't really have anyone to complain to about this. Sadly it's still too cold to take the bike out and get some exercise...I don't feel at risk of relapse I just wanted to bitch about the situation a little bit. I'm going to try to do something positive with my day so I'm going to get myself something to eat and go for a walk!

Just a great reminder of how awful life is when we are drinking! Just to think of all the things I have missed / messed up due to being hungover... 
I hope you had a nice walk.  It is staying cold so long right?  So tired of it.  IWNDWYT
Wow you and me both!! Since about 15 years old too! I would take my parents wine boxes up to my room. Jeesh. It is quite annoying to have plans cancelled that's for sure. Hopefully your evening will be everything you want it to be. Relaxing Sunday.... bittersweet. :) A walk sounds wonderful 
Ugh. I feel you. I had a friend who flaked on my today too. It had me in a shitty mood for a while. I ended up going for a walk and that really helped to make me feel better. Congrats on 75 days!
