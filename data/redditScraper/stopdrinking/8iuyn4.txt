We have an initiative in the UK called darkness into light.  It is a walk that starts in the dark at 4am and is five km long and finishes after sunrise or the Light.  It is in aid of suicide prevention. 2000 people turned up and it was incredible.  Anyway I was thinking of everyone here whilst doing it.  It struck me that 2000 people in my community got up at 4am to help and show support for other.  This means that there are people who care so we need to reach out and ask. As we walked thousands of people were at home or in bed.  No doubt some were struggling with issues behind closed doors.  As the sun rose in a new day I was filled with hope a new day.  It was 6am and I had walked 5km already! Life is for living not staying in bed drunk or hungover.iwndwyt

This is lovely. Where in the U.K. was it? I'll look it up and join in next time!

Wow this is an amazing concept for an event! Thanks for sharing!
I took part this morning up bright and early beautiful to hear the birds sing and walk together into the dawn. Pieta House are an Irish charity that provide counselling and support for people suffering from suicide ideation and families of those who have committed suicide. Their services are completely free of charge so fundraising is crucial for them to stay going. 
This sounds so good would love to join in on the next one!  IWNDWYT :)
