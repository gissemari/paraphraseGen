Some of the things I enjoy about sobriety is not being consumed with shame guilt and regrets.
I relate to this. I can't seem to find the right mindset to do anything new or try things that I may enjoy except drinking. .It's probably mental health related so maybe look in to local support for anxiety/depression and start there? I very recently started going to peer-support sessions that are held by a volunteer organisation so are free to go to. I feel a bit like they're quite basic and simple but I actually got a lot out of the last one. It hasn't stopped my drinking but I am hoping this sort of thing will help eventually..I hope that helps.
I think a big part in the beginning is staying active. No matter how fake it feels fill your time up with literally anything. .It will give you enough of a head start in order to find a permanent solution to the void that drinking no longer fills. .You can do it friend. IWNDWYT
