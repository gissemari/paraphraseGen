Hey guys ..This is my first post and i should maybe give you some background for my question. I have been struggling with addiction since i first started drinking/using when i was 14 years old. In the start it was pretty harmless the occasional drink and some weedsmoking. This accelerated over the years and i have been struggling since 18 yo with benzos cocaine and primarily drinking in the latter years. ..When i stopped with the benzos i started smoking more weed and i kept smoking pretty heavily for a couple of years. In these years i did not drink much and was completely clean from the powders and pills. The problem manifested itself when i tried to stop smoking weed because i replaced it with alcohol. I have been what i would call an alcoholic for the last 5 years. I have been drinking heavily around 5-6 days a week maybe 4-5 units on every weekday and 10+ units on weekends and then nothing on sunday because i cannot physically stomach the alcohol. ..Im 3 days sober from alcohol and have made a pledge to myself to keep on this road no matter what. The only problem is that i have picked up the weedsmoking again. So far it helps me a lot to cope with the anxiety and depression and also the withdrawal. ..Does anybody have any experiences with this? Am i just tricking myself in the long run or is it an viable option? ..English is not my 1st language so if it was unclear just ask and i will try to clarify.

I don't think there is one easy answer. Someone close to me got sober years ago and they didn't seem to be making a lot of emotional progress. Gave up the pot too and things started changing. My opinion and it's just that is that they were using pot to escape in a similar way they were using alcohol so there was a roadblock to progress. ..But if it's making the withdrawal bearable and getting you through...who am I to say you can't use it? I think it depends on how you use it what your goals are etc...From your post though it sounds like you were maybe dependent on it psychologically at least. You felt the need to replace it with alcohol in any case. I just think personally that there are other ways to cope with the negative stuff that are more productive and healthier. I can't say whether it puts you at immediate risk for relapse...but my opinion is that it's probably not a real long-term solution. I'm not sure any substance is a long-term viable coping option. Maybe weed as a recreational substance would work for some without jeopardizing their sobriety but who knows?..Good luck figuring it out. I would recommend finding people to talk with in person too. Meetings a therapist a doctor etc. Any and all might be able to help you reach an answer
I just want to say that I use marijuana for anxiety. It was suggested by my psychiatrist after going through countless prescription medications. The intention of the medical marijuana was to stop the severe anxiety not to get me sober however it did get me sober. I have absolutely no desire to drink anymore. Medical marijuana has done so much for me. It has gotten me off of alcohol cigarettes chewing tobacco excessive coffee consumption ( 1 to 2 pots a day ). All of it gone. I lost all desire for my vices. Some people say pot eventually makes them drink again. I believe them. Everyone is different.
