I have found enjoyment in writing poetry. If you would like one please feel free to reply back and include any thing you would like included. Name real or fake. Events etc. ..Trust this is within rules of sub...I always felt I did not belong.Like something was horribly wrong.I was a peg that was square.Life realy was not fair..I was in a hole that was round..I just felt I would be drowned.I struggled on each day.Not realy finding my way..One day I was to take a drink.On the sea of life I began to sink.I realy had got the elixer of life.Then came trouble and strife..I need more of liquid you see.It realy took hold of me.I was on a down hill run.It soon was no more fun..It took my job and lots more.If only I knew what was in store.I look so very pale.All over a glass of ale..I hardly could take any more.I was so sick and felt sore.If needed to stop the pain.But all hope seemed to be vain..I found a meeting of AA.They said we can show you the way.But I could not stop the drink.I realy did not know what to think..But the day came you see.I just said no more for me.I sat down and listened.My face even started to glisten..Each day I felt a little more well.The drink lost it bad spell.If you need help on life's way.Come and hear what we say..You can have hope in life.Leave behind trouble and strife.Just leave the glass on the bar.Hope is not very far..You too can be happy and free.As you travel in life you see.You can have a life like mine.1 day at a time...John 20/04/2019
