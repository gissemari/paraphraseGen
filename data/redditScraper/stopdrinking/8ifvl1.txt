Sitting in the court room I am here because I fucked up. I was heavily intoxicated when I got arrested. Back in August 2017 and now 9 months later my sentencing begins. Through these 9 months I've struggled with staying sober. I now no longer wish too drink anymore. I hurt the one person I love and now she is gone. But hopefully into not get this 1 year of jail time and something lighter like probation. Anyway I've made the decision that alcohol is not for me. I will not drink with you today.

Baby you will be on probation. Just remain positive. I love you and you did not lose me or Lilly. We still think about you constantly and wait for that door to open. I just hope your doing good. I'm still praying for the best for you. Remember we prepared for this. I know we left things off on bad terms but like I said I'm still going to be there. I promise I'm not mad at you and I hope the same with me too. We love you and care for you. I promise to not drink with you. I know we struggled but now it's not worth it. I promise to do my job and get my life straight while you're gone so when you get out we will have a good home and a future. We got this baby boy I promise. Just keep your head up. I love you.
