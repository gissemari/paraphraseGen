Hello SD Community..Throughout my college career I struggled with a demon we are all too familiar with. My super senior year I decided enough was enough and it was time to write a different story. I had almost made it a year clean but thanks to pressures I had from a new job and relationship I caved to temptation and have been off the wagon for almost 8 months now. I thought I could control it but it turns out alcoholism isn't just something you can shake (who knew). I have since graduated and moved across the country but the ole demon continued to show up. Most recently I didn't preform well in a promotion interview because I had been partying (mostly by myself) all Memorial Day weekend and needless to say I was fried come interview time on Tuesday. I look back at my extended sobriety as one of the happiest periods of my life and I am looking forward to starting the journey all over again. My half year resolution is to stay vigilant and remember that this is a problem I cannot shake. I look forward to reconnecting with y'all and sharing my experiences. Thank you for the open ears and I hope I can contribute to the community as well.
