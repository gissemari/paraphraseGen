I went out with friends and family last night just to play pool and I ended up drinking again. Which also lead to me doing drugs. I feel like a fucking loser and feel so guilty...Tomorrows a new day I guess.

I don't want to explore it too much because it's not my business we're your friends and family aware you're not drinking?..It just doesn't seem like a very supportive environment if that was able to happen. I don't know I wasn't there I'm not saying it is or isn't...But you know the answer to that and may want to make some changes based on whatever the truth is.
