Today begins day 4.   When my daughter was leaving for school this morning  I told her good luck on her calculus test.  She smiled her big beautiful smile and said "Thanks Mom  I love you." ..If I wasn't sober yesterday  I couldn't have helped her study last night.   I wouldn't have even remembered that she had a test today and I would have missed out on that moment.   ..This makes the struggle totally worth it.  I am not going to miss out on those little moments that make my life worth living anymore.  Those moments might eventually bring me out of this dark place that I have been in for so long.  I will not have a drink with any of you today.

Good job mama! You got this 
awesome
&gt; Those moments might eventually bring me out of this dark place that I have been in for so long...Man this resonates so much with me.  I can tell you 100% that yes those moments mean a lot and they will help you get back to the light.  I was you just 20 days ago.  You can do this!  I will not drink with you today.  
beautiful post thanks for sharing!
Being sober makes me grateful for and more aware of the "small" things which are really the necessary component to a full life...I didn't know what I was missing out on while I was drinking. Now at 100+ days I'm wondering what else I'm missing out on. Now I know I have the ability to do anything as long as I don't drink.!
