That's what I've been telling myself. If I don't let it affect anything such as work family friendships etc. then I don't have to feel bad about it... Right? That's what I thought until I drank myself into the hospital several times and recently lost my job. People--no matter what tricks your brain is trying to play it is affecting those around you. By the time I finally admitted to needing help and lost my job I told some of my close friends as well as my parents about my alcoholism but they knew... they all  knew and were waiting for me to realize it and get the help I need. They were actually in the process of planning an intervention I later found out. I suppose there were some red flags they noticed because I would always have liquor with me 'just in case' and would be drinking right when I wake up because of shaking...I relapsed tonight. I drank around half a bottle of vodka after I had been telling myself "you've been so good! You've been sober for a long time now... You can drink tonight as a reward and know that there's no chance of withdrawal... So why not?". While that is true the feeling I am experiencing right now was not worth relapsing for. Not in the slightest. I am dumping the rest of the bottle down the drain yet again. Drinking doesn't solve any problem--it actually creates more problems because it provides a false escape from reality in which we all have learned that "drinkin' and thinkin'" doesn't actually provide any useful solutions and mentally reinforces the idea that you need a substance in order to deal with stressors in life rather than confronting them. I know as an alcoholic that I can expect to relapse every now and then but each time I do I realize how stupid poisoning ourselves with ethanol really is. I wish it wasn't so engrained in our culture... especially being from Wisconsin...Thank you SD for all of your support and I read through as many of these as I can each day and it helps me keep the right mindset about my drinking. This truly is an amazing community and getting sober gets easier each day that passes. I will not drink tomorrow. I drank today and I shouldn't have. I will not beat myself up about this have no liquor anymore and am out of money so I cannot get any more anyhow. I spent my remaining cash on poison and it was not nearly as satisfying as anticipated. I will make a mental note of this experience and remind myself of this the next time my brain tries to talk me into just having one drink. It is never just one drink...I will continue looking forward and not entertain the false ideas in my head that I completely fucked up and need to keep drinking. I don't need to keep drinking and I won't keep drinking. Every release is a huge learning experience and I'm glad I can rant about it here and have support. Thanks again for everything SD... and thanks in advance for reading this and guiding me towards sobriety even when I fuck up and relapse. This is something my family doesn't understand and my parents either yell at me or start crying when I relapse. They just don't understand the life of an alcoholic and that I'm trying to get better but all of do... That's why we're here. Thank you.
