Hi guys I don't know if this belongs here or not.. but I was just curious if anyone had any advice for my situation. Someone very close to me has gone downhill with drinking very rapidly in the last 2-3 years. How do I help them? What can I do? I don't even know what to say or how to bring it up or if they would hate me for maybe assuming they have a problem when they don't feel like they do. Anyone that struggled with drinking how would you have liked someone to approach you on the subject? Any help is appreciated I just really don't know where to start or what to do.

I would have been really defensive if someone tried to talk to me about it.  I think your best bet is to try the sub /r/AlAnon/ or go to a local AlAnon meeting which is geared more toward loved ones of people with alcohol issues...&amp;#x200B;
Thank you!
