This is the longest I've been in 18 years (since I started). I would describe myself as a binge drinker who always wished they could stop. OMG the difference is insane. My weight is down skin is clearer mind is clearer. I'm still getting savage bouts of anxiety but I think that will pass eventually...One thing I will say is that alcohol does provide a "break from yourself" - without it the volume of my own internal struggles is way LOUDER. So be prepared to face your demons they're still there. I had been self medicating for so long I had forgotten what my dreams were...In some ways my insecurities are now more pronounced I spend all day every day with myself. There is no rest-bite of drunken bliss and there aren't days where the only thing I could think of is how to heal this hangover. ..On the other hand I'm actually equipped to deal with life in a coherent way. Action is taken in all areas of life. The clarity is worth it alone...Results; have eaten more junk food (seemed to be justifying because no alcohol). More productive at work. More Studying done. Some mood swings. More time in the gym. Clarity about future objectives in life...Anyway my intention now is to do dry February without junk food. Dry January was great. On to the next.

Hey great job! Being with myself constantly without a break can be pretty exhausting sometimes I feel you on that. But as you said the clarity is worth it. I'm almost to a point now where I feel like being sober is more exhilarating than being drunk was like who knows what change is on the wind. What unknown thing will change my life this year? What whim will snatch my attention next? Good luck with continuing your sobriety! IWNDWYT!
Well done!!!!
Dry february..I am with you...Iwndwyt
