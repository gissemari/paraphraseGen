I hope I am posting this in the right place but I am looking for ideas for ways to celebrate my bf's one year sober. He went to rehab when I was 7 months pregnant and has been clean ever since. I am so proud of him! He has gone through a lot of life changes this year and has never complained or relapsed despite working in the food service industry and being surrounded by alcohol. He has dedicated himself to being an amazing dad and I want to show him that I appreciate everything that he has done for himself and our family.

1. That's awesome of you...2. They make those candles shaped like numbers right? Maybe a cake and a party popper for when he walks in the door? Ooh and a card that says thank you for all the things you mentioned in your post.
You're great! I just had my one year anniversary and I baked a cheesecake AND a key lime pie. I had supportive friends over to help me eat all the damn dessert. It was really nice. Congrats to your boyfriend...one year is SUCH A BIG DEAL!
My SO took me out for a nice dinner.
Does he regularly mark the passage of time since he stopped drinking? Is it something he talks about and will feel comfortable if a big deal is made made of it? ..Sometimes I can react defensively when I feel too much attention or credit is being given for my not drinking. "What didn't you think I'd do it?" ...sort of thing...But you know him better than anybody. And congratulations to all three of you! One year is awesome!
Thanks for the great advice you guys! And congrats and great job on your own sobriety!
