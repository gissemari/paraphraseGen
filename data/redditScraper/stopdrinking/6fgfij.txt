best decision i have ever made.  it changed my life. i went in with the attitude of getting healthy.  i worked hard.  but the most important thing i learned is that rehab isn't a cure.  it is not a one and done.  i needed continuing support when i left still do to this day.  i find that in alcoholics anonymous.  best of luck!
Congratulations! You are fortunate to have the opportunity to go to rehab. It got me started on a lifetime of recovery. It takes more than luck.I I listened learned and laughed. I followed the rules hung out with people who wanted to get well did assignments and followed discharge recommendations. Keeping an open mind helped me and I learned a great deal.   
Everyone says they learn a lot in REHAB.  I wish you all the best.  I won't drink with you today.
Good luck buddy
Good luck. Sometimes we just know when we need to do more and need some extra support. Good for you for getting some :)
