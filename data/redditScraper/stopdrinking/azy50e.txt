29m very heavy drinker. Around 1.25 liter of vodka a day during the winter. ..On Friday I got my call to get back to work next week and well I'm still alive after three days. I wasn't sure if I'd make it through but I have so far. ..My shakes are considerably less intense. The audio hallucinations are getting much less frequent. I'm seeing clearer. My cramps and the sweating are both subsiding.  I'm an emotional basket case though. I'm paranoid. I'm scared of every little sound around the house. ..I don't know why I'm posting. I guess I just wanted some positive reinforcement. I'm not getting much in my personal life. Everyone is just brushing me off and expecting me to relapse again.

Remember what this feels like. The physical and mental symptoms. Then remember what it's like living with a sober clear mind. Then perhaps make the choice to live which ever of those two ways you prefer for the next 24 hours and then see how it goes. I make that decision each day some days it's harder than others. Good luck to you
I've been through the same thing...A few more days about a week for me with that kind of drinking and I'm starting to feel normal again...Good luck with the job...Being without work is the worst thing for me. Nothing but time to fill and booze does that wonderfully...A job really helps with structure in my life. I need that...There's more of course. A whole lot more but you're doing the right first steps...Good luck with everything.
You are doing great! I haven't been able to tackle even 1 day recently. Please keep going.  Just for today.
