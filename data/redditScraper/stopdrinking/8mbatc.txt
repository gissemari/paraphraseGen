Got to 30 days again. This is the second time I've gotten this far. Last time I lost it one day 53. This time I wont relapse. ..I feel like I'm in a high school relationship with my sobriety lol. It's my monthiversary! ..Thanks for the support you fine people give and stories you share. This community has been such good inspiration! Keep it up! ..IWNDWYT!

AA usually gives out coins at 1 day 30 days 60 days 6 months and 1 year...I have held on to my AA coin [actually a key fob] since day one.
Congratulations on a month! IWNDWYT
