I've always been an anxious guy &amp; most everyone close to me recognizes it as a personality trait. Anyone out there who struggles with anxiety and drinking let me tell you the two are related. Keep up not drinking you'll love it!..I'm at 27 days I know not long but I'm proud. The first week was hell! Major anxiety over everything almost crippling. At two weeks it started to noticeably subside. Now at almost a month I feel infinitely more in control of my mind and anxiety. It feels fucking awesome. I can only imagine what's to come...Anyone who's going on their first try at sobriety and struggles with anxiety tackle that demon and you'll see the others getting scared of ending up like them...This community is awesome! IWNDWYT!

Thanks for this 
I agree!!! My anxiety has definitely gotten better but also changed? It's hard to describe but it seems to be popping out a bit more unexpectedly but less often. ..IWNDWYT!
I agree. I have had anxiety a lot over the years and stopping drinking has definitely helped. I highly recommend it.
