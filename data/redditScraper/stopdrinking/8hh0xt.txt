Well back to day one and feeling terrible. ..I've been an alcoholic for about two years but the last few months have been a constant struggle of trying to stop. I've spent all morning throwing up and feeling awful about myself. I also have an eating disorder and alcohol makes it worse I go on benders and go days without eating. ..Two days ago I had a blow out fight with a friend of 15 years and the friendship is over. I'm pretty upset about it it feels like a new low but I think it's actually a good thing because I need to surround myself with sober people friend is also an alcoholic and a drug addict and really just not a very good person. We used to be much closer but have kind of drifted apart. He said some hurtful things about my boyfriend and I just kind of lost it he introduced me to my boyfriend and has been rude as hell to me ever since I started dating him. My boyfriend is my biggest support he got sober a few months ago and while he struggles with depression he's been able to stay sober and I so admire him for that. He's beyond wonderful and he deserves better than me so I'm going to better myself for myself my child and my relationship. I don't want to lose my boyfriend because guys this man is GOOD. ..I guess there isn't really much of a point to this post but I feel like making a post might help me stay accountable. I will not drink with you today.

You got this! Once you get sober you start to see who people really are. Unfortunately your friend may not be the good friend to you he once was. People who have their own problems with substance abuse feel threated or abandoned once someone close gets clean. It's just how it works sometimes. Take care of yourself   I wish you the best...I will not drink with you today
