I have started to notice that lot of us share happy moments memories successes here besides the sad broken stories losses cries for help. .So much to be inspired and learn from the happy stories and so much support for the struggling .... I guess I am in middles of it with a short relapse which I woke up quick and got on the wagon of sobriety this time with solid determination. .The story of 1 yr sobriety great spirit there .and pics plus the Canadian wedding ..... Gold pure gold..Makes me feel this site is for us to share a lot more and behind every happy story each of the writers has attributed it to sobriety .. Let's keep it going .One of these days I will reach mile stones and tell my story with pics.

I couldn't think of anywhere better to share the birth of my daughter almost 3 weeks ago. This group gave me better support than I found anywhere else. To see pics of all of us LIVING is significant and shows us the gifts of sobriety that are ours for the taking. ..Here is my old soul looking back at me...http://imgur.com/LxRFfjb
Keep it up! We are always here for you! 
That's one of the reasons I come to this sub each day.  When I see other peoples good stories it just reinforces why I choose to stay sober.
