8 months sober...still struggling to get my life back together. Since getting sober I've survived failing the bar losing my job at the law firm I was working at because of failing the bar continued separation from my husband (who seems intent on divorce). ..I've been struggling for motivation and find it hard to get out of bed many days. But today I made myself eat take a shower and call three other alcoholics. People in the program say you can't think your way into right living but you can live your way into right thinking. So even though I felt very depressed I practiced contrary action by speaking at an AA meeting. Afterwards a woman told me that she's looking for a sponsor and I'm meeting with her tomorrow to talk about the steps! When I'm struggling the best thing I can do is find someone who has it worse than me and try and be useful to them. Esteemable acts build self-esteem :)..If you are struggling...hold on... relief can come in unexpected ways.

Hi Roxie that sounds like a lot of tough stuff. I'm sorry you're having to deal with all of this. The bar is a bitch right? i can't imagine you'd be able to focus on your studies while dealing with relationship problems and alcohol. all those sound tough on their own and together they sound uber tough. .."you can't think your way into right living but you can live your way into right thinking" - this !..about the motivation and depression i think depression is its own thing. struggled with it since my teens and i think we need help. either exercise or therapy or medication but really exercise can make a huge huge difference. ((((hug)))) hang in there we can do this
Nice work!
Thank you!
Very inspirational.  The journey is far from easy but I have to believe ever so worthwhile.
