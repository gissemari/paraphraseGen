Its been a little while since I posted..I love my sobriety. While my life is far from perfect and I have been struggling a lot with a serious case of depression lately not drinking has been keeping my head above water. I think my sobriety is playing a part in my mood. I don;t have alcohol to shut my thoughts out but I just need to learn how to change my habits and the way I see myself. .I have lost over ten pounds been exercising a lot and have far more control of my life. Everything just feels so manageable. .Has anyone encountered a disgust of any form of alcohol? Just the thought of wine grosses me out now...I know how hard this is so for anyone struggling i am here with you. I have a lot of bad days but just know you arent alone.

"Has anyone encountered a disgust of any form of alcohol?"  Totally.  The smell which I swear I can notice from quite a distance is nauseating.   I don't know if that's because I had to gross myself out with it mentally to stay sober or whether it's just a natural byproduct but I've definitely noticed it.  You've summed up the feeling well: love the sobriety but there are still struggles and depression without easy relief.  Glad to know I'm not alone!

I'm revolted by the smell especially when coming from people. And I *know* I used to smell like that. *shudders*
