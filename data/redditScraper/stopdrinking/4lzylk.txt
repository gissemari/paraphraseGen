[Guess. What. Day. It. Is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi9eTOqqTMs) ..You guessed it. Happy hump day! What's up Wednesdays are when we calibrate our sobriety check in see how our /sd buds are doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations with us below!..**Triumph:** Had a great conversation this week with the person I am working with as a peer mentor. They're new to the department and after working with them a few weeks they've seen a measurable increase in their performance across the things we've been working on. That put a smile on my face when he was super excited to share that in our meeting. ..**Struggle:** Work is getting busy again. The last few weeks were slow but it looks like that won't continue. Everyone is getting stressed and I am grateful for the tools I have to deal with some of the day to day crap being tossed at me. Trying to remain calm to help the team. Need to remember my self care including getting good sleep every night...**General:** Omg so I finally tried the cherry lime La Croix  and that is now my new official beverage of summer 2016.(no I've not been brainwashed by KetoJam!) What other tasty  (non-alcoholic) summer beverages are you looking forward to this year?
----------immediate responses--------

**Triumph** - They cancelled my favourite gym class. So I signed up for that same gym class online bonus being I can bring it with me wherever I travel and never need to miss it again! This is so modern!..**Struggle** - chit chat at work. I can't concentrate when people are making conversation at me. Some people REALLY like to talk. They can't be working either.  They're just not getting that I'm giving the bare minimum reciprocation and I want to get on with my work. ..**General** - Summer beverages - I have discovered a no-alcohol version of Pimms - lemonade and a tablespoon of balsalmic vinegar in a jug with ice with cucumber mint strawberry and orange slices. Very refreshing. 
Triumph: Things are looking up talking to my friends more. Spent some time out in the sun today planting trees. Very zen activity. ..Struggle: After getting a DUI running my business in rural australia is very difficult. But with help of friends and family I can get around this. ..General: Currently doing taxes. Does anyone else actually enjoy them? Maybe im just a masochist. 
**triumph**  ..Boyfriend's away for a work event. Usually I use this time to get as drunk as I want while no one's around to judge. Alone of course so no one knows I did it. Last such time resulted in a self destructive binge I don't remember. That simply isn't happening this time around. I love when I can relive past failures and absolve myself of them by succeeding.   ...**struggle**  ..I was up too late last night knitting and I'm dragging ass to get out of bed.  . ...**General**  ..These beverages sounds delicious I've read so far. What does adding vinegar do in terms of these mock tail? I guess knock down the sweetness and give it that almost alcoholic bite. Hm. Christ I need coffee. 
**Triumph** - About to hit one month!..**Struggle** - I'd like to go back to school this fall. The classroom is my #1 social anxiety trigger. The paralegal degree I want is half online/half my local junior college. I've dropped out of college twice. I'd rather not make it a third time. ..**General** - my go-to drinks are water (boring but good) and fruit/veg/soy milk smoothies. At about 100 yumtastic calories apiece they're great for a snack and the evening sugar cravings. 
**Triumph:** I'm starting to be more help than hindrance at my new job. I really like working there and the time just flies by!..**Struggle:** There's a bit of a drinking culture at this office. Lots of talk about previous parties drunken behavior and not remembering the past holiday weekend.  It didn't make me want to drink at all actually but it made me worry a bit about future office parties.....**General:** Got a new water bottle with an infuser. It's awesome!!  Currently loving frozen raspberries in the infuser but I'm looking forward to experimentation!
**Triumph:** Had a great holiday weekend with company...**Struggle:** Sometimes it sucks to be aware of my emotions and irrational thinking. Some big picture issues at work had me tightly wound stewing stressed and out of sorts. I coped but reminded me why I spent so much time escaping...**General:** I make shrubs--sugary vinegary fruit syrups--this time of the year. They're trendy in cocktail circles but also make excellent additions to teas seltzers and lemonades.
Triumph: My daughter asked me to go to her boot camp class for a try and I agreed. Something I wouldn't have done a few months ago...Struggle: My OCD is in overdrive...I guess alcohol used to tame it somewhat. I try to meditate and it has been helping a little...General: I love putting fresh fruit in my infuser water bottle. That is my go to lately but I love my unsweet freshly brewed iced tea.
**Triumph:** Started a new diet ..**Struggle:** Currently....dieting also my psychologist had to cancel monday which was a bad week for it so thats less than beneficial...**General:** I really want a box of tagalongs and a smore's frap from starbucks and a blender... so I can just pour the cookies into the smore and make it one..
**Triumph** - made it through the memorial day pool party without drinking even though I was pressured a lot by a couple of people...**Struggle** - I can feel depression setting in and I'm tired all the time.  I have no motivation I just want to sleep...**General** - those Bai drinks are pretty good I like the cherry &amp; blood orange
Triumph: 50 days! Honestly haven't even noticed how fast the days are adding up (after that first week of course lol). I spent A LOT (for my income) on my daughter's birthday gifts and they will be there on time! So much better than spending $30 on a card and overnight shipping like I did last year (insert shame face). Accepting that my current success is proof that I am allowed to forgive myself for things like that in the past has been work but I'm coming around! Getting through these past two weeks with a healthy mind goals accomplished and a positive outlook on the near future is my real triumph today. In my drinking days...none of my past two weeks would have been possible; including my bills being paid worry-free...Struggle: Dude...you are allowed to forgive yourself!You are allowed to be scared! You are allowed to be proud of your positive changes however small! I'm working on truly accepting these premises and mantras. Also this apartment cleaning procrastination struggle is too real right now...General: Wanted to post solely to contribute to the beverage discussion...ended up sharing lol oh well. My current beverage addictions: 1. Monster (the Juice ones specifically the pink Pipeline Punch is next level good) 2. Coffee 3. Mountain Dew in all varieties but especially Kickstarts. I've been consuming enough caffeine to take out a small elephant but mehhh :-)
Triumph: Made it through work on Monday and made it to my two days off. Did nothing yesterday besides finish season 4 of Star Trek: DS9 today I'm cleaning going to lunch with my mom and niece cleaning some more then running...Struggle: I was REALLY craving alcohol this weekend. Not because of the holiday but because I work retail and work stress was ridiculous. Monday I came pretty close to buying alcohol. I told myself "Not tonight. Tomorrow if I still feel like it." This sub has taught me some great skills...General: IT'S JUNE which means only about two more weeks until my sister her husband and my three other nieces come visit!!! I haven't seen them in person in three years. I requested off work Father's Day weekend and we are all considering going to my city's Comic Con along with my brother. :)
**Triumph:** Celebrated my first sober birthday. I drank sparkling cider went out to lunch and hung around outside to enjoy the beautiful weather with my friends. The temptation to drink was at a zero. It was a beautiful way to kick off this next year of life...**Struggle:** Although my struggle with mental illness seems to be kept in check with my new array of pills my biggest concern right now is that I'll never be able to find a man who could love me and want a family with me because of these past struggles. ..**General:** I have to go to the grocery store and the pharmacy and I don't feel like it. I just want to lay around and be boring all day. 
**Triumph:** I'm going to put one of my employees on a performance plan and then most likely let them go. that.....doesn't really sound like a triumph! but it is for me. I'm usually an amiable manager who has few conflicts with my team. this situation has shown me that I can be tough too especially when people start taking advantage of my kindness. ..**Struggle:** my doctors and I found some masses and I'm getting more tests done on Friday. I really hope they aren't cancerous. (I'm 33.) there's a good chance they might be but I'm trying not to freak out. I'll probably write a full post about this later. ..**General:** I'm gonna make a simple syrup with the fragrant rose geranium that I bought at the farmers market. mix that with some ginger beer a splash of pomegranate juice and voila!
**Triumph:** I had to return to "the scene of the crime" over the weekend -- I had to hang out with family at the same place where my last drunk happened 9 months ago. I was really nervous but had no problems drinking pop and snacking instead of drinking beer. My wife even mentioned that my not drinking seemed to make other people drink less so that felt really happy...**Struggle:** I really need to finish this dissertation. I have made way better progress on it since I've been sober but I just need to put the nail in it. On top of that I got a rejection letter for a paper I submitted to a conference proceedings. Another paper got accepted but it's funny how the rejection outweighs the acceptance sometimes. The reviewers left a lot of amazingly helpful comments though so that's nice...**General:** I never appreciated sparkling water when I was drinking but after I quit I had my first one. I seriously had to check the label to make sure it wasn't alcoholic it was so damn good!
Triumph: Today is day 17. Officially the longest I have gone without a drink in my entire adult life. An old friend stopped by yesterday. She had a bottle of Jack (my kryptonite) and I told her I quit drinking. She was so proud of me and I'm proud I didn't even think about touching that bottle. ..Struggle: I started smoking again it's the next vice off my list. Here's to another day 1...General: I used to love mojitos so I've taken to a new recipe:.Muddle approx. 8 mint leaves and 2 to 3 wedges of lime. Shake with simply lemonade (regular or flavored I like raspberry). Pour over a glass of ice. Top with soda water or sprite for some fizz. Yummm. Make sure to have a straw you don't wanna be eating mint leaves and lime wedges. 
Triumph - only my 3rd day of officially declaring sobriety however Wednesdays used to be one of my go-to binge nights. My gf hangs out with her friends after work which meant I got to slam a 6 pack of tallboys before she got home. I can honestly say that I do not feel like doing that today at all...Struggle - I injured my lower back pretty badly last Monday while working out. Working out has always been a great stress relief which I thought would be helpful with becoming sober. Now that my workout has changed to basically stretching and physiotherapy I'm trying to find ways to kill the time I would normally spend in the gym..General - my appetite is killing me. Since my stomach used to be bloated with beer I never really over ate. Right now all I can think about is my craving for carby foods to make up for the sudden shortage with giving up beer.
Triumph - had a difficult conversation and dealt with it head on no avoidance no drama. Felt very calm versus recent level of anxiety I've been feeling. The conversation went well and opened things up for further communication...Struggle - still trying to figure out why I have made the decisions the way I have. Been working with therapist for a while and the journey continues. Just remind myself to be patient...General - Happy the sun is out feeling ready for sunshine and in need of some relaxation.
**Triumph:** Haven't had a drop of alcohol in 10 days and it's been almost 3 weeks since I last got drunk. I'm starting to be comfortable spending time with my girlfriend while sober...**Struggle:** A friend/co-worker has invited me out for drinks next Saturday. I don't want to tell her that I'm trying not to drink right now so I said yes. I'm going to have a couple of weak cocktails and switch to soda when she gets drunk enough not to care (I have successfully done this a couple times during the past month) but it's a risky thing to do and it stresses me out...**General:** There's a local shop that makes great rosehip kombucha I love it so low in calories too. Stewart's sodas are awesome too especially the cherry cola. And let's not forget this classic summer treat : Starbucks Frappuccinos with the whipped cream on top.
**Triumph:**  First 30+ mile bike ride of the season complete!..**Struggle:**  Relationship continues to be rocky and I wonder if I'm settling for someone who does not treat me in a healthy way...**General:**  I have GOT to get on my garden or I will not have any veggies this year!!  Seeds got started late and I may have to suck it up and buy some starts to put in the ground.  Grr...
Triumph- today is my first day of my first class of my PhD!  A perfect reason to continue with sobriety (am getting more comfortable with that word) - I need a clear head for this stuff.  ..Struggle - I am sleeping like crap and having terrible scary dreams.  I know this is normal but it stinks...General - I am finding a strong spiritual component to my commitment to stop drinking.  I know that not everyone believes in this sort of thing but I'm Catholic and went to confession yesterday. It strengthened my resolve so much more because I really did feel bad for the time money and effort I've wasted on such a stupid hobby-turned-addiction.  Feeling freer than I have in years!
Good: I'm back here after a few months away...Bad: It's payday tomorrow and I know I'm going to be tempted. Anyone mind if I PM them tomorrow if I hit a rough patch?
Triumph: Went camping over the weekend and as planned I did not drink. It wasn't difficult by any means- Especially when I was going through altitude sickness! Finally feel better today!..Struggle: I'm annoyed that there is beer in the fridge and a bottle of Jack hanging around leftover from the trip. Going to have the evenings to myself for the next few nights and I don't need that to be in there. It's bad enough that I have a lot of b/p food taunting me. Been feeling down lately now a little over 2 weeks. Haven't gone to yoga so that doesn't do me any good. Peeved with this May Gray &amp; June Gloom business. Man I'm too sensitive :/..General: 100 days is coming up! That in itself is motivational for me. Re: La Croix- Cherry lime sounds good! Will have to look for it next time! 
Triumph: It's day three for me and the fog that I call "this weekend" has lifted. I joined the Smart Recovery online and am going to join a meeting this afternoon after work. .Struggle: I struggle with "Will I ever drink again"? I need to remind myself on why I am stopping in the first place..General: I'm halfway into the work week and today I woke up so I should be happy for that. I'm broke until next Friday due to the fact that my cable company took an extra payment out but hey I'm alive I have shelter food and all other bills paid..so life is good. 
**Triumph:** I've made it to 5 months!..**Struggle:** A late payment has caused a bit of a chain reaction that means I've no spending power for a few days...**General:** Looking forward to a summer of sparkling water then hopefully enough money earned and saved to afford a little holiday with the family.
Triumph: I made it to 300 days! Gizmo and I moved into a better and safer environment. I am excited to cook for my roommates / girlfriend in a cool kitchen!..Struggle: I fucked up my rotator cuff in my right shoulder. It's sending pain through my right side (especially my neck and abdomen). I had my girlfriend massage it yesterday and it helped for a bit and now it just hurts and bothers. ..**General:** Homemade smoothies on a warm humid day! Mhmmm
**Triumph:** tomorrow is 6 months. :)..**Struggle:** health insurance in particular for medication in particular for mental health. I would type more but it would rapidly become something that is more suited to /u/stratyturd's rant thread rather than the hump day thread...**General:** apparently I don't have the motivation for capital letters that I usually do. maybe tomorrow.
Triumph- I went to lunch with a friend and sat at the bar and didn't drink. I didn't even want to. ..Struggle- went through a breakup had a stressful night at work and PMS. Still no drink!..General- love being sober!
Triumph: Today at work I was feeling pretty stressed and my instinctual thought was: "Man I need a glass of wine when I get home." But almost immediately after I realized what a dumb idea that would be and that it would make me infinitely more stressed not less. I'm proud of myself for reaching the "drinking won't solve my problems" mindset so quickly! ..Struggle: I still stress a lot about my eating. In addition to drinking problems I've had a history of binge eating/starving myself and being obsessed with weight loss. Now that I've quit drinking I'm afraid I'm spiraling into the weight-loss obsession/starvation mindset because it's so appealing to me that so many people have lost weight from not drinking. Has anyone else struggled with this? ..General: I have now officially told everyone in my closest circle of friends and family that I'm no longer drinking and I've received nothing but love and support! I am extremely lucky to have such a strong support system in my life. :) 
Triumph: I figured June 1 would be a nice day to start my journey in earnest because it will be easy to count the days one day at a time. /sd is my companion in this. Every time I want to reach for a drink I just come back here and read. ..Struggle: I don't really want to drink but I know I'm going to have insomnia and feel like crap for a few days. I actually had my first week of not drinking last month and I found it refreshing. However I fell off the wagon when I got a call mom had a heart attack. I allowed myself to try to wash away my anxiety but I'm ready to stop for good now. ..General: Thank you everybody!
Day four almost over.  Starting to feel like I've finally got a little momentum 
**Triumph:** Work has been bonkers for the last month. I am more organized and focused and should be able to get my team through the next few week to hit our deadline...**Struggle:** Im starting to think allot clearer about my actions over the past two years and Im noticing I have allot personal problems that either I completely didn't see or was avoiding due to drinking. I need to fix them and that may take months if not years.  ..**General:** Starting to work in a an exercise program to help burn off excess energy. Excess Energy. That's nice.
Struggle:  Had a few beers last night.  First in months.  Fuck.
GOTTA try cherry lime La Croix for sure!.Thanks for the recommendation!.Day 3 w00tw00t closing in on 4 as I'm in for the night! :D
Triumph: quickly closing in on 4 mo wo drinking. Less than a week away. Mark off another holiday sans booze! It can be done! So far I've made it thru Mardi Gras my sister's visit good Friday/Easter umpteen crawfish boils my birthday my husbands birthday Mother's Day and Memorial Day wo drinking. ..Struggle: major major cravings these last 3 days or so. Almost white knuckling at times. Confusing to me Bc the first 3 mo were incredibly easy.  I barely gave drinking a thought. The past 3 days seem to have come out of nowhere. ..General: done with sons' baseball for the season settling into summer vacation enjoying the freedom of unscheduled days with my kids.
Triumph:  Made it through Memorial day weekend. ..Struggle: Baby Mama Drama...General:  Smoothies.
