I haven't told many people in my immediate life that I have struggled with alcohol and am now pursuing sobriety but of the few I've told only one of my friends has said they are proud of me for doing this...No one else really seems to care all that much or think this is anything hard for me to do. Some nights that's enough to make me doubt I even have a drinking problem and that I should just throw in the towel and down some vodka. But you guys have always been here for me...You all have been with me through many of my sobriety milestones and you all have supported me because you know just how hard this truly is. I am inspired by each and every one of you and am so grateful I found this thread. So thank you! I just want to let you all know that you're positively amazing and I'm happy to be sober with you guys today

I found SD on day 2 and it has been invaluable to my sobriety. Congrats on triple digit days.

I hear you.  I have only like a couple people that are happy and support me.  The rest don't get it or are mad that I'm not drinking with them anymore.  At least I know I'm doing what best for me!  IWNDWYT
