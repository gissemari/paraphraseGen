Congratulations on two years. That's awesome:-)
Congratulations! Remember two year olds are getting to be bigger more confident and into the "I do it myself" stage but they still need lots and lots of loving and cuddles. 
Here's to the May 2015 babies. I'm sure it will only get better from here. Congratulations (to both of us).
Congrats! What an amazing milestone! Proud of you 
Next year you can drop a "three MCs and sobriety" reference. Congrats on two turns of the sun!
Wonderful!
