I still havent drank since new years. 22 days is a ****ing record for me...However like right now I still find myself "planning" my night's drinking and activities...My brain: "Alright you're doing great. Tonight would be the PERFECT night to drink. Lets just get a six pack then a handle of vodka. we'lll put on the Ps3 and have a great time. Ok I'm gonna do it..."..and then of course I don't go through with it...But for some reason I get a lot of comfort being able to have these old thoughts. But I KNOW I am treading a very very dangerous line with this way of "forbidden" thinking. It might only be a matter of time before a relapse...Think I should give up this sorta of weird compromise I have with my alcoholic brain?

No. Fantasizing about drinking is a warning for me and I act to shut it down immediately.
A good way to handle that is to play the tape all the way through. When I had those thoughts consistently I'd imagine what the reality of that night would be. For me it would likely end in a black out which could result in jail time destroyed relationships death and all sorts of other shitty things. The reality was that alcohol no longer brought me the relief that it once did. I have to remember that today. I lost the right to drink by the relationship I had with alcohol.
right on man congrats on 22 days. get yourself a badge! its on the right bar of stop drinking...I'm 22 and i got over 2 years sober now and i do fantazise about drinking sometimes....I'll picture myself going out with someone or a girl and grabbin a bottle starting to have drinks feelin drunk and good....Theennnn the part where i take the bottle home to my room drink myself retarded probably puke because my tollerance is gone. Continue to drink and then the next day drop $400 on 10 40oz bottles of whisky and spending the next 3 weeks getting drunk every day. ..I'd like to imagine that I wouldnt talk to anyone but in my drunkenness I would probably post on facebook I fucked up or tell someone directly and then word would get out I relapsed....Obviously I wouldnt give a fuck about school and I'd probably start looking for hard drugs because fuck it! Never tried coke but now i want to....Que credit maxed and im broke and friends are gone. Everyone is mad because I'm a total asshole when i drink because fuck everyone. Then I'm back to square one where I was when I sobered up in the first place except now I imagine the family will be hesitant to help me out......The little saying is be sure to play the entire tape through. Realize the consequences for your actions the re-action to the action...So again yes I do fantasize the drinking but I also fantasise the consequences.
I used to but I have been told and can look back at my relaspes I relasped in my mind before I pick up. So I don't entertain drinking fantasizes to keep myeslf off that slippery slope. I encourage you to as you said give up this weird (dangerous) compromise.
Goodness no! The alcoholic part of my may try to do this but I disassociate with that part because it lies and tries to destroy me...Instead I "play the tape forward" and visualize what it'll really be like. I may enjoy it for a drink or two but it'll go downhill from there. I'll drink too much maybe do/say something stupid. Maybe drive drunk to the store to get more booze later. I'll wake up hungover and ashamed and will quickly devolve to daily drinking again. Then it'll be even harder to quit than it would the last time...To hell with fantasies there's my reality... there's no pleasure left for me in that bottle.
To me the biggest turning point in my sobriety was when I **accepted** that I'm an alcoholic.  It happened for me at around day 45 (Jan 1 2013).  My wife and I went out with friends on NYE and I had a miserable time because they were drinking and I felt left out...In talking about it the next day (Jan 1) I had an "ah ha!" moment when I realized just how differently I saw drinking vs. how my wife does.  She could take or leave it.  We go out to a nice dinner sometimes and she doesn't order wine (I'd never have done that).  We have a nice romantic night at home and she doesn't think to get wine (I would have... every time).  And so on...And now my thinking is that "Lets just get a six pack then a handle of vodka" is crazy talk.  People without a drinking problem don't have thoughts like that.  And since my **acceptance** of my alcoholism I recognize that thoughts like that aren't appropriate or healthy...So for me allowing thoughts like that romanticizes drinking which was sort of the problem for me anyway...FWIW: Those thoughts don't last long.  I haven't had the thought to have a drink (or an urge) in LONG time.
I do not ever think about drinking or have any urges anymore but that took time.  ..I don't know if this is related but back when I was fully addicted to drinking I would wake up without sleeping well feeling anxious and not remembering much of anything from the night before and say I am not drinking tonight.  I would believe myself until around 3pm to 5pm when I would feel better and I would start getting physical cravings and then start negotiating how much I would drink and how it would be my last night.  I would have my "last" drink and say farewell etc.  I do know that when I made the decision to drink I felt better without even drinking.  So maybe that's what your brain is doing.  Just a thought.
In the midst of a physically and mentally exhausting workday today I caught myself imagining having a beer after work. (I am actually salivating as I type this just from thinking about it.) Then I imagined having beer before noon on a Saturday a few weeks from now and drunkenly yelling at my kids. That and my resolve not to reset my badge kept me from picking up a six-pack. ..ETA: I am having hot tea instead and "window shopping" on Amazon. If I dwell on the fantasy I'll drive myself crazy.
