 I feel really good about that but I also want the number to be bigger. Temptation is very fleeting these days. I certainly don't feel a level of temptation that would have me back at the liquor store buying a bottle. What might become a struggle for me is the honeymoon of not drinking feels like it's basically over and I need to just live life as a non-drinker. I don't mean I will never struggle with not drinking -- I just mean that for me not drinking in itself is not much of an identity. ..BUT I am really happier than I've been in a long time -- and that's pretty darn good. Thank you r/stopdrinking for existing. IWNDWYT..&amp;#x200B;
