Day 10 was the hardest for me so far. That's when the *real* cravings started to hit. I was on the verge of a relapse but thankfully managed to avoid going down that path. Day 11 was more of the same still trying to convince myself that I had earned a drink after going 10 days sober. Day 12 (today) a friend actually convinced me to go to a bar to watch Rousey's comeback at UFC 207. They know that I have a problem and even after informing them that I'm trying to quit they wouldn't let it go. Seriously conflicted I eventually agreed to meet them - a decision I instantly felt guilty about. I've been jonesing for a drink the last two days so a bar is the last place I need to be. Well we walk in and it's completely packed with people who are there to watch the fight. Not a single seat in the house and at least 20 people waiting in line for a spot. Friend asks if I'd like to try somewhere else. I politely decline and drive my sober self straight home. Thank you Ronda!..Just a list to reference the next time I consider drinking.....**Benefits of Sobriety:**  .**Financial:** In just 12 days I've already saved about $72.00.  .**Physical:** Sleeping much better. / Mornings are much more enjoyable without a hangover. / No more dizzy spells when sober (this was becoming an issue over my last couple weeks of drinking).  .**Mental:** I can actually remember what I did last night. / Surprisingly I've felt more outgoing since quitting. I always felt that I was more interesting with a few drinks in me but it turns out that's not true. / Don't have to worry about whether I said or did something regrettable the night before.

good for you!
Thank you for your post. I'm at day 4. Feeling pretty crappy. Your post included the benefits your receiving from sobriety. It gives me a sense of excitement with the thought of feeling better. I won't drink with you today. 
&gt; still trying to convince myself that I had earned a drink after going 10 days sober...I was the same way.  Have to reprogram my brain to stop thinking of alcohol as a reward.
You didn't miss much ;)..Well done with making the right choices. I'll keep making good choices with you and not drink today.
