I had two close calls in two days. Yesterday I was at a poetry open mic night and one of the guys that I was hanging around there had a pint of (presumably) vodka in his pocket and he was clearly on one. It took a lot for me to stop myself from either straight up asking him for a swig or sneaking off to a nearby liqour store and buying one of my own...Then today was another toughy. I was at a party for the fourth at my partner's mom's place with all their family. I was freaking the f- out and then I saw the bar... it had the most beautiful bottle of whiskey I'd ever seen. Or at least it just seemed like that at the time. I kept staring at it all night making up excuses to go to the bathroom so I could walk by the liqour cabinet amd just look at it. Alright maybe I was plotting a way to steal it. I kept kept wondering if I could take a few pulls from it if my boyfriend would notice or his family. If i could get away with it... Luckily we left the party early but as I was driving home I realized that there was nothimg stopping me from going to my old liqour store and buying a bottle of popov or taaka. I reasoned that I didn't have to drink it tonight. That I could just keep it around to smell it or that I could have it on hand just in case...I didn't end up buying a bottle tonight nor did I end up stealing one. Hell I didnt end up drinking at all and I'm safe at home sober after a nice long skate session that I took after getting home from the party. I didn't really have a point to this post I'm just reflecting that even at 5 and a half months I'm still struggling with this sobriety thing sometimes. Anyway stay safe out there fellow sobernauts IWNDWYT

You're able to harness self control even though you don't want to. That's freakin' awesome. There have been so many times I simply caved in those kinds of situations. But you didn't. That's big. ..I've been posting here when I get cravings which helps me a lot. This place got me through a tough one just an hour ago. ..I'm glad you're checking in with us instead of drinking!
