It's Friday afternoon. I've had a good day but wine has been on my mind all day. ..I have been almost convincing myself that I deserve an occasional cheat. Deep down I know this an occasional treat doesn't work. Not for me anyway. Today is a struggle and I'm getting jittery. ..So I'm going to check-in now and spend the rest of the evening telling myself I will regret it if I don't check in with a number 7 tomorrow!!!!..

Just get through today and that's enough for now! IWNDWYT!
Happy weekend!  Good for you being proactive.  I found that fear of regret wasn't the only tool I needed.  I kept snacks and treats on hand so when the craving got bad I could grab that chocolate bar or seltzer water or soda or ice cream or pickles or whatever and re-route the desire before it got the best of me.  For the first couple months I took a long hot bath nearly every night after work and read this sub or This Naked Mind or Easy Way.  Basically I went into healing mode and pampered myself because defeating the demon is no easy feat. ..&amp;#x200B;..I will not drink with you today!
Here's to a happy sober Saturday morning tomorrow.  We can do this!  IWNDWYT :-)
