Somehow today marks 200 days.  I am still learning every day.  Since I had my epiphany on November 29th things have evolved but not changed.  I am happy that I awoke on November 30th and still felt and believed as I did when I went to bed.  Today I still feel similarly.  Nothing is the same as before and yet everything is the same.  Nothing has changed but for myself being totally different.  I see things now that I feel are only privy to a select few.  I feel extremely fortunate.  I am trying to live my life moment by moment and within each moment be solely focused on who I want to be.  Compared to before I have nearly boundless empathy compassion love patience and tolerance.  My catholic girlfriend read the passage below and thought of me...Joel 2:13.."for he is gracious and compassionate slow to anger and abounding in love and he relents from sending calamity."..I am agnostic..."With Malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in"..I am so thankful to be a recovering alcoholic to have friends in AA and for this community.  If you are struggling please try to persevere.  You might not understand why or for what you must.  It might seem like it isn't working or it is hopeless.  However what you do know is that the way of drinking didn't work.  Give sobriety a chance.
