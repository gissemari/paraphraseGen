Hey guys!! Hey guys!! Happy Wednesday! [Let's all go learn something!.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsltM-0mEbw)..Let's hump it out on this happy day! Hump days are when we calibrate our sobriety check in see how our /sd buds are doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations in the format below...**Triumph**: I hosted a party and let people know that I'd be providing fancy waters and if they wanted alcohol they could bring their own. Some people did and of course there was some left over. The second the door shut behind the last guest I poured it all down the sink. No concerns about "wasting it" no thoughts of drinking it myself (even though NO ONE would know)! It's nice to win these little super-important battles with my drinking. It makes me feel like I'm control of the struggle. ..**Struggle**: Even without drinking I struggle with a lot of the associated behaviors. Avoidance isolation lethargy etc. It's always a teeny bit of a struggle to put on my gym clothes or get dolled up to go out with friends. I enjoy it when I go but these things are a little draining. Is that just the case for everyone? ..**General Chat**: So I'm all about the vinegar drinks now after sampling some at a Korean Spa. The [Rosemary Blueberry](http://www.elementshrub.com/) over some ice and club soda is my new favorite thing. Have you made any new food/drink discoveries recently?..More important how are you guys doing? How has this week been for you? Let us know your triumphs and struggles!
----------immediate responses--------

**Triumph:** My knees were x-rayed this week post-bicycle accident and the orthopedic doctor said: your right knee is like an old rocker that's been rocking back and forth on the same porch plank for years.  I'd show this film to one of my joint replacement guys and he'd ask so when are we scheduling this guy?  In your case because you bicycle everywhere it works beautifully like tongue and groove furniture so keep on rockin'...**Struggle:** Dr. Goodfellow (real name) also said while bicycling and exercise is amazing for your screwed up knees this positive value can be canceled out by getting killed--don't get killed...**Chat:** I'd rather watch paint dry than ride a stationary bike.  
TRIUMPH:  after resetting my Samsung Galaxy I was going thru abs re-downloading a bunch of apps. I found a really cool one called Sober Today for free download. It tracks days money and # of beverages sober. Really cool to have and be proud of! ...STRUGGLES:  went to a renaissance festival this past weekend.  It was the place I last drank (last year) and it was a bittersweet moment. Didn't really tempt me or give me urges but it was weird seeing everybody double fisted craft beers and think last year I was one of those ppl. All in all it was a good experience for my sobriety...CHAT:  started my 1st tattoo  an Egyptian themed sleeve  complete with the Sphinx  Nefertiti bust the great pyramids king tut skull and crossbones some camels and even a hairless cat   I'm super excited to watch it progress. 4 or 5 more sessions and it will be done! ...LIFE IS GOOD. SOBER LIFE IS BETTER
**Triumph:** Survived another boozy wedding reception without drinking.  Thanks coffee!..**Struggle:** Lately I've been running into people who were negatively affected by my drinking (or more accurately my inability to keep my pants on while drinking).  I don't know what to do with all of the guilt I'm experiencing.  Thankfully I've found a therapist who seems decent.  Hopefully they'll have some thoughts on the subject...**General Chat:** No new food discoveries here.  Still living on coffee and ice cream...
TRIUMPH: Ive been cardio and weight training 6 days a week for the past 6 weeks. I measured myself on Monday and Ive lost 2cms off my waist and 4 cms off my muffin top!!! HAPPY DANCE!!!..STRUGGLES: I had to go to court this week and it sucked hard. Ive been struggling a bit psychologically but nothing like I would be if I was still drinking. ..CHAT: I adopted a rescue cat from the RSPCA! She's 7 and awesome! I love having a pet. Her name is Chubb Chubb :) 
**Triumph:** Just (within the past 15 minutes) submitted my application for promotion. Cleared the first of the HR hoops. Hope I can keep hopping. Huge relief to get the confirmation that everything uploaded correctly...**Struggle:** Been pulling late nights for work and life reasons. Over-caffeination and underslept is catching up with me. I'm headed on vacation but will be doing a couple more late nights in the hotel to get work wrapped up on time...**Chat:** I experimented with [fruit shrubs](http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-a-fruit-shrub-syrup-174072) this summer. Fun but never really got anything incredible. Ginger beer or San Pellegrino are still my go-tos for soda-y drinks.
Not a full week's update but....**Triumph:** Well I guess I coupla days without a drink. It's a small step but I guess at the same time a big one..**Struggle:** I feel strong psychologically but not physically. I ache my eyes hurt and my head is throbbing. Am full of nervous but not bodily energy..**General chat:** Have stocked up with root beer. Am drinking more chicken soup than a hyperactive Jewish mother could ever hope to make in a day. Am just about to go for a cycle ride on this lovely bright day to meet the founding member of "the _ben_jamin_ fan club" my delightful niece. The speakers hooked up to my bike will be playing [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Lpx6JIMmk).
**Triumph:** I've got 3 months sobriety achieved. Will hit 100 this weekend..**Struggle:** I'm just blah. I'm not really looking to drink but I'm kind of at loose ends. More things are annoying me and I feel like I'm heading into a depression again. Sober is good but happy would be welcome. .**General Chat:** I'm going to attempt to start meditating daily. I hope it will help me get my head screwed on a bit straighter. 
**Triumph**: A week caffeine free! I didn't have a large habit but it was a daily habit to try to bypass the ugh feeling...**Struggle** ..1. No chocolate has been a small struggle so I went blackberry picking which I'm eating with yoghurt in the evening to fill the gap...2. In two minds about whether to attend to an event that will bump into ex-colleagues and rake up my past...**chat**: I struggle with avoidance too. With the gym thing I just make sure I go regardless of how I feel because going regularly supports me. With meeting friends I recognise I just need time alone to recharge.
**Triumph**:  I'm continuing with going to my SMART meetings and my ACOA meetings and just went for the first time to a sober gym that's FREE for sober members.  I'm starting to feel the benefits of fellowship for keeping my focus on the benefits of sobriety as well as making positive change in my internal mental and emotional landscape.  I'm feeling like all of those things I had been aware of and wanting to change are now accessible to me since alcohol is out of the way.  It's like alcohol was a roadblock and now I have less fear and more access to working on myself.  I'm feeling kind of high on this awareness!..**Struggle**:  Despite all of this I still entertain fantasies of drinking "someday".  I don't give them much energy and am not currently at risk of drinking but I don't like that ambivalence lingering in my mind.  One day at a time I guess...**Chat**:  Man I wish we had that shrub in CO!  Sounds delish.  Also hoping that I don't come crashing down from the high I'm feeling right now about the new way I'm feeling.  Feels a little too good to be true.
**Triumph:** I've been getting more and more work from a client that had dropped me previously due to my drinking...**Struggle:** I'm doing Stoptober from tomorrow but struggling with the idea of giving up another one of my 'pleasures'. It's crazy as I don't enjoy it (the same as I haven't enjoyed drinking for years) but it feels like a loss somehow...**Chat:** I'll have to look into what 'vinegar drinks' are but I'm trying to drink more sparkling Water and cut down on caffeine. I'd love to try this la croix you all talk about but I don't think we can get it in the UK. 
**Triumph**: Getting close to 100 days! Went to a Giants game last night and I enjoyed myself. I went with a friend who is supportive of me not drinking. It felt good. I did catch myself watching the clock though. Time goes so much slower when you are at an event sober. .**Struggle**: I am struggling with old friends and finding new sober friends. I am naturally social and I need friends. I can only spend so much time with my wife and kids..**Chat**: Really bummed my 49ers are looking like crap. 
**Triumph:** Not much aside from being on my 20th day sober which is pretty good considering I've struggled to get more than like 5 days in a row for the past few months. ..**Struggle:** Not much aside from work and coworkers getting me down. I have no friends at work and I'm a 20 something who works with a ton of other 20 somethings. I've managed to alienate myself and no one really talks to me. When I do try to get involved I feel like they just ignore me. They know I smoke and will ask pretty much every other smoker to go out for a smoke with them and never ask me. It just sucks and keeps me from coming into the office so I work from home and further alienate myself from them. ..**Chat:** Not much! I'm dogsitting for the next 2 weeks so I'm pretty pumped about that :)
**Triumph**: SO and I made an offer on a house (our first)!..**Struggle**: SO and I made an offer on a house. Seriously this process is insane and we're not even in escrow yet...**General Chat**: There's is absolutely no chance that we would be in a position (financially and mentally) to buy a home if I hadn't gotten sober. None.
Triumph: been working out with some regularity and have been feeling great! ..Struggle: my hormones seem to be all over the place (I attribute it to my body still working through some drinking crud). Broke out like a teenager this week and then caught a stomach flu (super gross). ..Chat: can't find much of anything that's working food wise with this tummy bug except green tea at the moment. Here's hoping its short lived so I can get back to stuffing my face with candy soon. :p
