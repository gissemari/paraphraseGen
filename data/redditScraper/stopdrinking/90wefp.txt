Hey guys. I've currently got 14 days sober down but I'm starting to struggle. What do you guys do on Friday &amp; Saturday nights when all of your friends are out at bars or parties? Tonight's especially hard because the girl I've been casually seeing is in Vegas partying with friends and she's drunkenly hooking up with guys. That kind of news obviously makes me want to hit the bars and do the same thing. ..Any advice? I've really enjoyed my sober days so far and I'd hate to dive back into booze.

Hey hang in there. It can be pretty rough a couple of weeks in but it gets better. In fact there's a pretty predictable patch of low mental health (along with the associated cravings) somewhere between two to four weeks.  It does get better mate...As for what to do - gaming hang out online hang out in the chat... clean read a book watch a movie... lots of things that can distract us a bit.  Hang in there friend :)  Well done on those two weeks - you're doing great!
Rediscover things you liked as a youth -  board games etc - they will distract you and give a nostalgia hit plus you may end up getting closer to friends who don't just go out drinking on the weekends. (Ps yes i know lots of adults never stopped playing board games).Edit to add keep up the good work two weeks is hard glad you made it.
If you are lonely and the idea of playing board games all alone isn't exactly enticing. Get out of your house get out of your mind--maybe find a meeting.   ...Honestly the tit for tat thing unsustainable.   ...Only the addicted think that poisoning themselves will punish anyone else. 
I just got a load of hungover texts from last night and somebody I worked with couldn't remember a business meeting they were at on Friday as they were still drunk after I hours sleep on Thursday night. That's what keeps me going!
