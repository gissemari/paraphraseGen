Yes definitely. I'm struggling to get back into an exercise routine hoping that will bring my energy back
Definitely. i've been thinking I might need to boost my nutrition and water intake. 
Yup! I found I wasn't eating nearly enough. I was having between 15000-200000 alcohol calories a month when I was drinking so when I stopped I didn't eat more at first. I make sure I eat or snack all throughout the day and workout first thing in the morning to jump start my metabolism. Long walk and stretching at night before bed helps too.
Definitely. I haven't Ben able to make it through the day this first week without at least one long nap mid day.
For me energy level took just a little over a week to rebound.  Sucks about the job thing but once your body adjusts to the alcohol-free state I'm guessing your energy levels will rebound.  Sending the proverbial good vibes your way.
