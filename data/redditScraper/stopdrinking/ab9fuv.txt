I won't go into too much detail here but I havent been clean of alcohol for a long long time. ..I've had my fair share of relapses and recurrent binges but this time has gone much better!..I've recently had the chance to talk very openly with my ex about my alcohol abuse and it went exceedingly well. While drinking affected this relationship a lot it wasn't all me either and I've known that the entire time. ..Anyway having that candid talk was very healing and motivated me to stay away from alcohol even more. ..The longer I do this the better it feels so iwndwyt!..Happy new year everyone!
