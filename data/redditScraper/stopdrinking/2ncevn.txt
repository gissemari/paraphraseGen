Being home for the holidays in my old stomping ground really brings back these feelings of nostalgia that can be so strong. Back when life was easy and I was still having fun with my addiction back before life caught up with me. Of course I am beyond the point of no return and that is gone forever however sometimes my brain tells me otherwise. ..I even got that deep nostalgic feeling tonight attending a meeting I used to frequent in my younger years as a chronic relapser. Funny how being in a sage place can make us so vulnerable...Just needed to share that.

Isn't it? There are a couple cities I'm not ready to go back to.
Thanks for sharing. Nostalgia freaks me out too. I'm glad you shared this and I'll be thinking about it this week. Good luck and congrats on 760 days!
Yeah... I wonder what it would be like for me to go home now. There are a lot of memories of favorite bars drinking spots get togethers etc. Doesn't help that my family is full of alcoholics either. Probably a good thing I'm not going home for the holidays :)
