It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Warning: This week's WuW contains graphic medical details. Possible TMI.**..**Struggle:** Because of my MS I have a brain tumor which I have known about for a year or two. Since it is benign (thank God) I have mostly ignored it but it is starting to become symptomatic so last week I got it treated with radiation. The procedure involved fastening a metal device to my head with screws which really hurt!..**Triumph:** If I were still drinking I would have ignored the symptoms of the tumor until they became unbearable. At that point the procedure would have been much more major and might have involved actual invasive surgery which would have been a nightmare. But because I am sober I can deal with things before they get completely out of hand...**General:** Recently a family member told me she believed that I was drinking in secret. I asked her what made her say that. She hemmed and hawed but finally admitted that she couldn't imagine not drinking so she had decided that I *must* be drinking again and since she hadn't seen it she thought I must be hiding it. ..I just laughed..
----------immediate responses--------

Welcome back missy. Sounds like your spirits are high. ..  IWNDWYT 
Going to be 80 today in Maine and I have no struggles at the moment. As from a triumph I went to the gym yesterday and had a great workout and to round out the general being sober is kick ass...IWNDWYT
Feeling like that pink cloud is fading away...now I'm just bored.  I had a dream that I drank and was so upset that I'd have to reset my badge.  So really drinking won't even fix the boredom.  It would just add bad feelings and who wants that?  Life is hard enough...
Checking in going to be a great day.
**Struggle:** I m trying to get to terms with a loss that hurt on an existential level. I know perfectly well that everything is totally rational and explainable but the damage to the soul is just a gaping hole. How do you mend a fabric so fine you can t touch it? Will find a way though...**Triumph:** Coming through weeks of rekindled silent craving...**General:** Ring the bells that still can ring / Forget your perfect offering / There is a crack in everything / That's how the light gets in..Mary thank you for sharing. Lots of love to you!!
Struggle: Tomorrow I'm going back to my weekly quiz nights I'm pretty sure I can make it through but it'll still be a bit hard I think. Thankfully tomorrow one of the guys going also doesn't drink so hopefully I can hang out with him...Triumph: 8 days sober I'm still super tired but overall I feel miles better than when I'm drinking my anxiety has pretty much disappeared.
**Struggle:** I feel a bit out of touch with everything right now. I meet friends I hang out with my family I go to work but everything is just a bit numb right now. Having an existential crisis and thinking about how fragile everything is. ..**Triumph:** I'm going through emotions and am letting myself feel everything...**General:** Will try to look at things from the outside and internalize that I should be happy. And if not happy make changes towards it.
*Struggle* work.. ..*Triumph* Not drinking on weekdays has become a new normal. I don't have to have an internal battle about it I simply know that I don't do that anymore..*General* I need to cut down on sugar. I eat it the same way I drank alcohol.
**Struggle:** I'm not really sure that I'm doing okay in the head. I generally feel a lot better now that I've been 3 months clean and sober but I keep going through these crazy emotional ups and downs on a near weekly basis. I keep carrying on though because these would be a hell of a lot rougher if I still had the bottle...**Triumph:** I had a buddy from my hometown stay a few days on his way across the country. I was worried that he would hate me or that I hadn't let go of anything either of us had done that drove us apart but it was cool. A few things got awkward here and there but I feel comforted by how quickly overall we just melded and started shootin the shit like proper buddies. I look forward to seeing him again. ..**General:** I have a couple graveyards in my schedule so I had time to learn a ton about the difference between a latte and a cappuccino. I'm not sure if that will benefit me but oh well. A job's a job. Night desk is night desk.
Finally realized I needed a bit of help and got on Antabuse. Best decision ever. My mind is made up for me from the moment I wake up. Fuck alcohol. Not drinking with you all today.
Day 23 in an inpatient treatment facility. It ain't great but it's better than jail
Struggle: My anxiety has been AWFUL this week! I don't know why but it's killing me. ..Triumph: I talked to my boss about our communication issues and it seems like our relationship is improving...General: it's finally gonna be warm today!!!
**Triumph:** I've been doing a great job of working on my current set of goals this week!..**Struggle:** I need to go on a date with a woman soon and I need to make it happen. Putting yourself out there is terrifying though. ..**General:** Starting next week I'll be writing these morning check-ins on a custom PC! All the parts come in by Friday and then I just have to put it together.
**Struggle:** Just feeling a bit 'meh' this week. It'll pass.....**Triumph:** Found an NA beer that tastes good and doesn't make me want to drink the real stuff. Finally something other than fizzy water to drink when out and about...**General:** I've been diagnosed with Narcolepsy...Still I'm not going to lose any sleep over it...
I'm so glad you're OK after that treatment u/sfgirlmary! How are you feeling?? Thinking of you and sending love and warm hugs xoxo...**Struggle:**    I went to my PCP and endocrinologist yesterday (just got insurance that's why I'm doing the dental/medical stuff all in one shot guys). My antidepressant isn't working as well anymore and we've made a decision to change it...which means I started weaning off today and will not start to the new med till next week. I'm concerned about how I'll feel with taking only a half dose. Hope the new med works well!..**Triumph:**    The GOOD news about the doc visits: My BP is 110/70 liver heart everything else is perfect. I suspected my hypothyroidism was out of whack and I was right. I started Synthroid this morning :)...**General:**    As Mary said above it's amazing how much we can pay attention to our bodies and minds when sober. If I was drinking I'd think the recent emotional bouts and few extra lbs was because of the booze. Now I know the real problem and the real solution. Yay Sobriety!!!!
Struggle: health issues. More worries than actual problems...Triumph: had to do multiple phone calls for work. Was very nervous at first but now the no longer make me anxious. I can do it!..General: I feel like I quit drinking ages ago. It hasn't been that long. Weird. My flair doesn't reflect my mental image.
Celebrated four months yesterday a hallmark I've arrived at many times before. Trying to stay in today to stay in this moment and be engaged in life again. Recovery is a beautiful thing.
My friend Mary my heart goes out to you about you health good juju and everything. I laughed about your cousin - thanks for starting my day with that!..**Success**: I am in Indianapolis I spoke at a conference yesterday. I used to teach and frankly love being in the front of the room. It went well and I got great feedback. ..**Challenge:** I had late afternoon and evening by myself and I felt all loose ends. I started feeling depressed and anxious and some really interesting stuff came up for me emotionally. I get to take that to my therapist when I get home but it scared me a bit. I*did* realize that I think part of was that I had eaten dessert (intense chocolate pies) two days in a row and had more grain/carbs/sugar than usual too. I know sugar impacts my anxiety in a big way so it was a bit of success to realize that. ..**General**: My cousin is picking me up in an hour and we're going to surprise her mom who's in her 80's. The last several times I've seen either of them have been at funerals so I'm really looking forward to not having that pall over us. I said in the DCI that I don't know if she'll recognize me because I was drinking a shit-ton when my dad dies three years ago and I weighed about 50 lbs more than I do now. 
Always praying for my sober warriors but especially for you SFMary... and it was a chuckle that a family member conjured up that tale about you. I guess I either pray for her also or as we say in the south  well bless her heart.  NDWYT...
Struggle:  Had a friend that I've known since first grade take her life over the weekend.  It hit me hard because I just didn't see it coming she was an arty hippy type had a husband and two daughters. The funeral is on Friday and it's going to be a rough one. ..Triumph:  I'm 1 satan sober today.  (666 days!)  Huzzah to that.  ..General:  With the passing of my friend it got me thinking about why I'm putting off my own happiness.  There might be some scary changes coming at some point but we'll worry about that farther down the line.  
**Struggle**: I feel like I'm over the initial hump but I can't help but feel temptation and feel sad when I see my friend with a big mug of beer. It doesn't help that weather is finally nice out. Soon enough it's barbecues and patios left and right. Brace yourself more cravings are coming... ..**Triumph**: I got to 42 days. Isn't 42 the universal answer?..**General**: I started getting this sense of re-learning how to live life. In a way it is very daunting. In a way it is just so easy to live life from one drink to the next. Problems? Drink! Happy? Drink! Bored? Drink! Goals? Nah just drink and worry about the next few days. Plans? Not needed just have a drink and relax; life goes on anyway...Did you ever **feel** *time*? ..It's like time is now a feeling and I can feel it flowing and I feel myself moving through time and boy oh boy it is moving **fast**! Maybe it's just the sense of regret that I wasted my 20s drinking and now in my 30s I feel I lost part of my youth already. At least I won't waste the rest of my life that way. 
/u/sfgirlmary that sounds really hardcore! I hope the treatment works and the symptoms go away as soon as possible xxxx..*struggle* I've got some new work starting - and while it's exciting and with people I really enjoy working with how I am going to manage it on top of my existing gigs I do not know... already feel like I am working too many hours every week but making ends meet has been pretty hard and I'm 50 next year so taking those gigs that boost my income expand my skill base and shore up my longevity in my field is really quite crucial. ..*triumph* I am finally feeling confident in myself more often than not. Been a looooooong time coming...*general* we had a mouse problem but I don't like the idea of poison [it can kill animals like our cat or dog or local birds if they eat a poisoned mouse]; and I don't like the traps that kill them so I bought a cool thing called a "tin cat" that is a large catch-and-release trap and baited it with chocolate and peanut butter. So far in just over 48 hours have caught around 15 mice and done missions to release them in nearby bushland if it's daytime or at the park if it's late at night.  Glad I chose that kind of trap - only two have been European Mus Musculus species [the regular pestilential house mouse] the others have been three different kinds of native Australian mice [Melomys species]. All our native mice are either endangered or threatened species and they are VERY cute too! They HOP in big long arcing leaps instead of scurrying - it's quite a thing to watch when I let them go. Hopefully some of them will survive where I have let them go. There's plenty of seeds about this time of year. Fun fact - they do not nest in houses [unlike Mus Musculus] they just come in looking for food and then go out again  and they don't make that horrid mouse pee smell around the house. They often burrow in the ground or make very cute little nests in clumps of grasses.  They have elongated feet on their hind legs - almost like mini kangaroo shaped they do not have the long rodent incisors their noses are much pointier and their poops are also much smaller and drier than Mus Musculus ... tee hee.... facts about Australian native mouse pee and poop aren't you glad I shared that? :)..
I wouldn't call those graphic but that is just me. I am glad you came through radiation seemingly alright or at least compared to invasive surgery. &lt;3 ..**Struggle:** Keeping my sanity is proving to be difficult with my living arrangements. I love Boo and she takes care of me financially as I take care of her ever other way possible. But her attitude..... It's like a dark black smog oozing throughout the house. She isn't always like this - but I truly feed off energies around me.... maybe feed is not the word I am looking for..... I am sensitive to the energies around me in the sense that people's mood (or what not) around me can affect my own energy.... which could go either way. But with Boo's energy recently is just like throwing sugar in my mental/emotional gas tank....**Triumph:** I am surviving. I am pushing through this rough patch I am on day 12 of my healthy eating plan (and I thought not drinking was hard geez) and I am feeling pretty optimistic about my future.... hell a month ago I didn't think I had one other than a cell....**General:** My ex signed himself into a mental facility a few days ago. I don't think he is being completely honest with them or himself - which he really needs help but I think he's wasting this amazing healing opportunity he gave himself. ALSO though part of his "action plan" for when he gets out is going to AA meetings........ he's not an alcoholic. I know he started drinking in the last few weeks - so maybe chop the head off the end of the snake before it bites kinda deal? Maybe he is an alcoholic &amp; that was just something else he lied about? I honestly believe he just said that so that we had something in common. I don't wanna turn my back on the dude but before he went in he called me over 215 times half of which were in 45 minutes pretended to be his grandmother to get me to call threatened suicide several times (lost my cousin due that way) and faked cancer (grandma just lost her sister in Feb - she was my fav aunt). I don't think I can handle that kinda crazy on top of my own shit. &amp; I explained that when we broke up in a nice way - he called 14 times in ten minutes yesterday from the hospital so we shall see how that goes. Sorry for the long post - this prob should have been on the vent-o-matic but I needed to get it out....[High Five](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg)
Struggle: My husband and I have been arguing. He's exactly like Drax from Guardians of the Galaxy. Always takes everything literally. We argued about the difference between a police *chase* and a police *pursuit*. He gets hung up on a minor issue like wording then misses the entire point of what I'm trying to say. It seems kind of funny and small but the result is that I feel lonely and unheard. I want to connect with another human and feel like I'm being listened to but he won't let me get more than a few words out before he needs clarification on some small thing. ..Triumph: I've never been a good housekeeper and being a drunk meant I hardly ever did more than the bare minimum. My house wasn't a hoarders house but it wasn't functional or comfortable. My triumph is that I have it completely clean and organized now! I got rid of so much clutter and I have a daily routine for keeping it up. It's part of my motivation to stay sober because I know I'd stop keeping up on it if I were hungover. ..General: I found an Android app that's called Goal Tracker. It's just a simple calendar where you give yourself a check mark for your successful days and an x for the days you fall short of whatever goal you have. Of course my goal is sobriety but it can be for anything. It's like when you get a gold star in grade school and it makes me feel good to see those check marks add up!
IWNDWYT! 
Oh Mary ouch!  Sending hugs and good vibes across the internet for whatever that's worth.  Great job taking care of it.  It sounds nightmarish...**Triumph:** 20 months without alcohol!  It seems like longer in a way.  My attitude towards drinking has completely turned around and I just don't want it at all anymore.  I never thought I'd be saying that...**Struggle:**  Smoking.  Ugh.  I've been bad.  I've smoked a couple of packs in the past couple of weeks.  I am going to quit again.  I know I have the power to do it.  I just have been struggling. ..**General:**  The sun is shining and it's lovely out!
**Struggle:** I've been struggling a lot with my body image which is one reason I self\-medicated so much. I was bullied a lot as a kid and suffered traumas that have caused me to feel pretty negatively about my self\-worth. Lately my body has been changing a lot because of not drinking and exercising a lot more but it goes up and down. ..**Triumph:** I'm 2 months sober soon!..**General:** I'm in need of a better sleeping pattern! If anyone has tips on how to disconnect in the evening please send them my way. I have trouble putting my phone away.
struggle: work stress balance...triumph: exercise routine...general: work has been annoying but i am trying to live in the moment and just do the best i can  as that is all anyone can do.
**Struggle:** Ever since the switch to daylight savings time I haven't been able to get to sleep any earlier (11:30 instead of 10:30) plus I'm able to ride my bike longer after work (so I'm more tired physically) and I've been having a really hard time dragging myself out of bed in the mornings.  The alarm goes off at 6:47 but I hit the snooze 2 or 3 times (and fall back into a deep sleep in between) whereas before DST I was pretty much waking up on my own feeling rested.  ..**Triumph:** I'm finally feeling strong enough in my sobriety to once again attend a group [cycling] rides with my old friends who always drink afterwards.  It's a weekly ride but this group also does weekend events hosted by one of the riders and based from their home.  It's an affluent group so whomever's hosting has a stunning property and they go all out to make the Saturday afternoon/night a party to remember.  ..I've always been known as one of the hardest partiers of the group but after a few of weeknight rides and also one of these weekend events where I (gladly!) stuck to tonic water and lacroix I started hearing comments like "who is this person?!" and "I don't even know you!" (all in a good way).   ..I did not say much about it other than "yeah I quit" but one of the guys pulled me aside and confessed he was concerned about his own drinking as it had moved from 'only' weekends to at least 3 drinks every night after work.  ..It felt really good to just relate pertinent parts of my own story and to point him to this sub as well as Annie Grace's This Naked Mind.  I also told him that it is different from person to person and that only he can say whether it is a problem in his life.  By the end of the conversation he thanked me for sharing gave me a hug and said "sobriety suits you brother".  It was a huge and unexpected boost that has really stuck with me...**General:** Every time my old father-in-law sees me now whether it's in mixed company or not the first thing he says (in a surly voice) is: " are you still off the booze?" ..It's starting to really piss me off and I'm a little worried that the next time he does it I'm going to snap and say something really cutting (since any polite requests I've ever made in that past have only brought out even worse behavior).  ..He himself has drunk to excess on occasion throughout his life and more people on his side of the family than not are alcoholics including his daughter (my wife) but I am the one he singles out. Sigh... reminds me of a Robert Palmer lyric: .."She's my daughter and I'm her pa and you ain't nothin' but a son-in-law".
You seem like a really strong person!! It's easy to ignore symptoms when perpetually inebriated. I'm glad you can listen to your body right now. With respect huge eye roll at said family member  
S:  Getting things back on track after neglecting things for so long...T:  On track to graduate nursing school in a couple of weeks...G:  A nurse accused me of not being a team player and was talking mad shit about me.  It got pretty ugly but I didn't drop any F bombs so that's good.  It's the type of situation that I'd ruminate about while getting drunk.  Instead I dealt with the situation and I didn't drink over it. 
[removed]
hey yall!
**Struggle:** I still get really sad about a breakup I'm going through. I know it will get better eventually but it just sucks to have to experience the shitty feelings...**Triumph:** It's been one week since I last drank. I'm starting to be able to deal with my emotions rather than just chuck them in the backseat...**General:** I start a pretty cool job on Monday. I'm just happy to be here.
Got the urge to drink today and was able to get passed it. Big win for me.
Day 1 today. Sobernauts let's fly
Struggle : Maintaining my emotions when trying to talk to people with issues surrounding about addiction. ..Triumph : Made it past 100 days for only the second time in my life. Second time in the last three years. ..General : I haven't worked out for four days straight the longest in over three months. I have just been really busy and actually feel like I need it at this point. Taking a few days off makes me realize how much I enjoy taking the time out to work on myself and how much I enjoy other aspects of my life when I am putting in the work in the gym. Some thing I am starting to understand is that I need to see some sort of progress in my life and sometimes that progress is measured by being able to quite literally and figuratively STOP and smell the roses. 
Struggle - I'm fucking stressed to the max. Temporarily making a really long commute because of a new job. Taking care of renting out my place and living in a new place. Dealing with typical single mom business. Teenage boy drama. Just generally tired. My birthday is tomorrow and I really don't give a shit. My birthdays usually make me depressed. ..Triumph - this will be my first sober birthday in probably almost 20 years. I can't believe I'm saying that! I have a new job that I love! And I'm making it through all of this sober!..General - I need to learn to deal with stress and anxiety better. Going to try to listen to Ted Talks or some inspirational shit on my long drive in. Woosah. ..IWNDWYT 
Struggle- I thought my depression was getting better with my sobriety but I now relaize alcohol numbed me and wasn't the cause. I'm sad everyday when I realized I woke up. ..Triumph- I set out to do 100 days sober and today is day 97. No one can take that from me...General- Took up a new crafting hobby to keep my idle hands busy and working on organizing some rooms in my home. Everything is just good enough. Don't be fooled by people acting like getting sober magically changea things. It doesn't hurt by any means but be ready to deal with some shit without blinders on.
**Triumph:** I'm in great running shape. Yesterday was my final shakedown before my first event of the year (I'm not fast enough to "race") and I had a great run. Running was one way I dealt with all the emotions of getting sober. Now it's another reason to stay sober...**Struggle:** Getting things done. I often feel that the day-to-day and the latest most looming issues are all I manage. Things farther down the to-do list don't get addressed until they become the most urgent.../u/sfgirlmary I hope the radiation does it's job. Maybe some new superpowers to go with your sobriety too!
