Well I'm a little surprised to be posting here. I have been following this sub for several months now as a general source of inspiration (which should have been a sign to myself). But of course *I didn't have a problem* and *My drinking was under control!* Well I'm 29 and for the past four years I have been an at-home alcoholic. ..Looking back to my childhood my parents never kept booze in the house and I don't think I ever once saw them drink. Heck I didn't have my first beer until I was 21. I mean I followed the law right? Waited until it was legal? If I followed the rules how could I have a problem?..Well that just means I got to learn how to drink in the worst possible place from the worst possible people. Senior year of college. Every Thursday Friday Saturday and Sunday afternoon; binge drinking at the bars. Which back then of course binge drinking was have having ten beers and stumbling back to the dorms. I was attending a Senior Military Academy at the time (not a Service Academy) so that structure gave me a false sense of control. *This is just what people do on the weekends* I told myself. ..Then I got to law school. And the weekend binge drinking continued. But the addiction slowly began to expand in my life. I would have a glass of Whiskey or Gin to bring a stressful day to a close. I mean *What could it hurt it was just one*? Right? Well time marched on and one became three and three became seven. By the end of law school I was drinking Gin while studying every night. Get home pop open a bottle and just maintain a buzz while studying. *I mean this was normal right? People do this?* ..Then life got harder and slowly I drank more and more. It wasn't uncommon for me to go through two or three handles of booze a week. Just myself. I stopped making excuses for myself. *This is just who I am!* I wasn't struggling at work so what did it matter! Sipping to maintain a buzz was now a thing of the past. ..Rather than actually face my problems I would get home and immediately take two or three shots to get started. I'd pour myself triples or stronger in a lowball and tell myself *This is normal*. Most nights I would get home from work drink as hard as I could until I vomited. (Its amazing how much I have thrown up over the past four years. Probably averages our to 4 days a week for years. Im sure that wasn't good for me). Then I would go to sleep get four hours and repeat the whole process. ..I even coined a cute term for myself. I was an **at-home alcoholic**. I mean I wasn't out at bars running up huge tabs. I wasn't drinking and driving. In fact I pretty much only drank at home. By myself. Every night. But I wasn't breaking any laws so surely I didn't have a problem. ..Then I realized I needed to slow down. Which was when I started lurking here. But *I didnt have a problem*. I mean for goodness sake I wasn't drinking one day a week. Sometimes two. So clearly I was in control. My wife would ask me if I wanted to just have one beer with her (that's how she drinks) and my response would be *No I would rather have none than one*. See everything was under control. I could chose not to drink it didnt control me. **It was just blackout drunk or nothing.** ..Well Friday I killed a six pack and 2/3's of a bottle of Vodka. And I apparently said some very hurtful and mean things. I don't remember saying them I was too drunk but it was in writing so it happened. Sitting here sober I have no idea why I said what I did. Then this weekend everything started to sink in. ..I can vividly remember things from before I started drinking. But over the past four years its all been a blur. I thought maybe I was just getting older and time was moving faster. But there is a significant amount of time just gone. Sitting there on the couch wallowing in my misery drinking until I blacked out. ..I do have a problem. I can't drink responsibly (and even just typing that my gut reaction is *but I didn't break any laws* and *Im not a real alcoholic*). I think I'm going to give AA a try and I also scheduled some time with a therapist this week. (I've never dont that before and Im not sure its not just witch doctor silliness but I have to try something). ..I can't keep going on like this. Its amazing how it just creeps into your life. Like boiling a frog. I've sober four days now and IWNDWYT!

Welcome to SD! You are taking a brave step! IWNDWYT  
Seems like a good plan to start.
Welcome I can relate to a lot of this story but I recently came to the same conclusion.  Sadly as a result of saying hurtful things to my wife as well...  welcome aboard and IWNDWYT!
That is exactly how my alcoholism crept up on me.  Until it got to the point in my life no matter what activity I was doing I had an alcoholic drink in my hand.  I had gotten to a point where I was getting jealous of people who could go out and have fun with out drinking.  So I decided to finally make a change in my life and put the booze away.  Right now I am just taking it a day at a time.

Hello and welcome!  I drank " in the safety of my own home " . I held down my job and was far from appearing anything but together . 8 years of that and my life has reached a place where " together" no longer describes me . I'm not on a Dailey mission to survive . I just got a job after I quit my job of 8 years . I'm barely keeping up .The difference is I'm sober ! And I'm staying sober . So if I appear to not be " together "  that's far from the truth . I'm more together sober than getting drunk and being a fake . I don't think our happiness depends on a appearance people see . It's how we feel deep inside . Alcohol robbed me of my spirit . Today my spirit is free . IWDWYT  . 
Amazing how much one becomes a ton isn't?  One day at a time.   IWNDWYT 
This is my story too. Nobody in my family really drinks. I started drinking in college and have done most of it at home alone. Ugh. So many wasted hours I don't even remember. IWNDWYT 
That  It was blackout drunk or nothing at all' line really resonated with me. That's how I could trick myself too... I can not drink a couple of days a week see I don't have a problem. But if I had a couple of drinks with someone and they went home I would be inwardly really pissed that I would now have to carry on alone. The idea of stopping when they stopped crossed my mind of course but I didn't have enough control over myself to do that. I was just more fun than they were more hardcore had more freedom OR... I am just a lonely alcoholic. Denial is a very long river in Egypt... takes a long time to swim out into reality. Glad you did glad you're here and glad to not be drinking with you today x
I think you'll find that most of us on this subreddit fall into that category:  professionally and financially successful mostly educated reasonably intelligent.  People who can multi-task and compartmentalize.  People who feel a sense of control in general and aren't comfortable in the passenger seat.  Who see alcohol as a part of their identity as a means to rationalize the addiction ("this is just who I am!")...It's a very easy trap to fall into especially for those of us of the millennial generation who have so many peers struggling to find similar success.  We can't help but compare ourselves both to them and to the pants-pissing park bench drunks we all tend to think of as "real alcoholics"...The great irony of all of this rationalization and control and desire to maintain that sense of *agency* is that all along we have been manipulated into alcoholism by our primitive monkey brains.  That *we have* been in the passenger seat all this time.  ..I relate a lot to your story and with 75 days sober I can tell you that it's not all sunshine and daisies.  You're forced to investigate the nature of that hole you've been filling with gin and once you've palpated it once you've really gotten some blood on your hands you still need to figure out what's going to make it go away.  What else will fill that time that focus that need that anxiety.  But at least it will truly be your hand on the wheel not some hijacked dopamine response controlling your thoughts.  ..You will finally be you.  And that for me has been the real challenge.
I relate to your story immensely because I am walking almost (word-for-word) down the same path. ..Started drinking late learned the wrong way from the wrong people in the wrong place  law school made it worse now just usually drinking alone until blackout and saying mean things to my wife...There is nothing worse than drinking only one. What's the point in that? Right there in that statement is where I know I have a problem...I won't drink with you today. You are definitely not alone in this same struggle....
I was in your shoes friend. It was such a hard thing to understand at the time and even when I did understand it took a lot for me to act consistently about it...I hurt a lot of people and lost a lot of friends due to drinking (starting fights being a jerk) and quitting drinking too (the people I drank with didn't want to hang out unless we were drinking...so we eventually stopped hanging out)...Sobriety is a fun way to live but not an easy one to achieve. IWNDWYT but keep your head up. It only gets better from here..
Are you me? So much of what you wrote mirrors my experience with alcohol. I just hit a year sober today so I'm here to tell you you can get sober too. It's so worth it! 
I was right there with ya. I clearly recall buying a book about  cutting back  and sneaking to read it. I remember sitting there thinking  what the hell?! Am I an alcoholic?  Like you I was a at-home alcoholic. It does insidiously sneak up on you. The book This Naked Mind helped me tremendously. I'm on day 8 and feel the best I have felt in years. I'm not drinking with you today. 
It is super duper super insidious ... like you I would endlessly convince myself that I didn't have a problem.  Endless amounts of justification...Exactly like you I only drank at home... so clearly I had no problem...One of the hardest things I had to realize is there is ALWAYS someone worse off to compare myself to I finally had to make a change for myself and no one else.  ..Good for you for realizing what is going on...Also: you are in a tough time right now.  You will get the fukits after a week or two and convince yourself that you can moderate.  ..Keep powering through and find replacements.  ..Cracking seltzer cans and pounding them filled the void for me...Good luck on your journey check back with us to tell us how it's going. 
A lot of my friends can really drink so that's the stage I wanted to get them too if they wouldn't play ball I would be annoyed. It wasn't until the last few years that I'd drink alone. I would get to know bar staff so that I wasn't technically drinking alone. Drinking alone to me was the line of having a problem and I didn't want to cross it. So I'd always be hustling for a drinking buddy.
