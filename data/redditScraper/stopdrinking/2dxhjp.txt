So I'm 20 years old and I am finally coming to the decision that I need to stop drinking. I don't do it very frequently but when I do I get carried away and drink way too much and occasionally black out. The catalyst that is behind this decision is that two nights ago I had so much to drink that I blacked out completely and cheated on my boyfriend who subsequently walked away from me maybe for good. Drinking doesn't make me feel good it just leaves me anxious and exhausted and miserable. My granddad is an alcoholic and my dad has struggled with indulging and I would like to not follow down that path. School is starting up again next week and I need to get my life together to do well and stop hurting myself and ruining my relationships. If anyone has any advice on how they keep themselves from relapsing I would really appreciate it. ..EDIT: I also have set up several therapy appointments with a few different doctors.

Welcome /u/magsbags to r/stopdrinking--living an alcohol free life is a GREAT idea if you plan to succeed academically in your relationships or your career.  This is how I stopped drinking and got sober:..1. When I first started getting sober I started to begin each morning--at the very moment that my eyes open--by making a conscious and deliberate daily decision not to drink alcohol TODAY and today only--all day no matter what happens good or bad. When I say this I am actually suggesting a PHYSICAL RITUAL. (I still do this...2. I go to AA meetings which made a big difference and I went to 90 meetings in 90 days at the outset because as I said my AA sponsor suggested that I would do best if I learned to follow directions and that was his first direction...3. Tomorrow I do it all over again...Just going to bed without any alcohol is a sober victory in the very first few weeks...Staying involved here on this Sub helps me stay accountable...Finally key for me is the principle: that I act my way into better thinking not think my way into better acting...Good luck. Jump right in!.
Thanks for posting.  The fact that you are setting up doctor's appointments shows you are serious.  Follow through on the appointments and you will get a good perspective on what's available to you both good and bad.  Then you can make a reasoned decision.
