I'm wondering if anyone has any books to recommend. Of course there's the big book. But I'm more interested in personal stories. Preferably from younger people and their struggles. I'm a musician so biographies from musicians and actors are cool too. And entertaining :p..Thanks!.

Heavier than Heaven
Not a musician but Stephen King's "On Writing" is fantastic...and good writing advice is thrown in.
Blackout by Sarah Hepola! .
There's a link in the sidebar for lots of books.
https://www.amazon.com/Allen-Carrs-Easy-Control-Alcohol/dp/0572028504 this and quit the drink...easily by Jason Vale is what worked for me.
Steven Tylers "Does the Noise Inside My Head Hurt Your Ears?" - an amazing read. Also Shania Twains biography. .
