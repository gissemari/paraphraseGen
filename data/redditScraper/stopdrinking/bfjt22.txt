Since last Saturday I've been stuck working 12-19 hour days due to almost my entire crew getting sick. Short staffed stressed as hell and 4/20 isn't helping! Running purely on energy drinks and coffee and minimal sleep. I just gotta make it to Monday and everything will fall back in place. Of course my stupid brain thinks wanting to drink will fix everything. I won't give into the cravings though. Gave my wallet and card to my co-worker/friend and told them not to give it back until Monday. Completely took the choice outta my hands. Sometimes that's what I need though! Never feel bad asking for help! We are all human! We all struggle with something. IWNDWYT. Here's to 5 more hours of work! *tips glass of Pepsi*

Good on you for knowing when to ask for help! You've got this...IWNDWYT
Stay strong you are doing so well there is nothing alcohol will do to make me feel better.
Hang in there.  I too had a brutal week at work - not enough hours in the day. Good move on asking for help. Raising my cup of coffee your way.
