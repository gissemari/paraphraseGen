Four years ago today I joined this sub. I'd stopped drinking but wasn't done (that anniversary is in January). No long stories just this:..* Thank you to all here past and present for being here and being a supportive community. I continue to learn by reading and contributing. This sub has been integral for me and deciding to join and be a part was a big step among others that I was making at the time. ..* Sometimes my encouragement to people who are struggling is a simple *Hang in there.* Sounds simple but for me it's profound. It means: keep trying no matter what. Find unsuspected strength keep coming back. If I'm knocked down the only way I lose is by staying down. After joining the conversation here I went back out for more research but kept coming back here. So I say it as much for myself. *Hang in there.*...[I'm feeling thankful for the small things today.](https://youtu.be/q0bQ7wJmrbA?list=RDq0bQ7wJmrbA)

Happy   Day  .So glad you're here.    
Happy Birthday!  You have always been a good contributor since I joined the sub last winter.  I agree that we must not give up.  I have failed after some sober runs but I am not giving up.  I have another good run going.  We will see where it leads.  Keep coming back! :)
