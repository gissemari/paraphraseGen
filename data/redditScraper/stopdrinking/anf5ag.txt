I was working the last 2 nights and 2 days before that..12 hour shifts..Paramedic..Was sober the whole time..I want to get better. .I started listening to unchain your brain on the 30 min drive to and from work. Felt great.. Felt I could do it. .Come wake up at 1pm.. Drink was all I could think about. Resisted for 4 hours....I'm drunk. I hate it. I didn't want this. But here I  am. I don't have to get up tomorrow morning. so I know my partner won't see it.. I... Don't think she knows when I'm drunk anyway. I'm struggling... How do you do it.

As outlined in the community guidelines we ask that you only post when sober. For this reason we had to remove your post. But we'd love for you to join the SD family. We'll be here tomorrow if you want to come back then.
