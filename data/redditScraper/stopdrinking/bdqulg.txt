I'm curious how hard you've looked on the web page or app to try to figure it out. At what part in the process are you stuck? If you let us know what you've done that hasn't worked. If you haven't really tried yet then this could be a great little chance to feel some empowerment. ..Look around on the app or the web page. If you've given it an honest effort experienced a few failures someone will help. But and I'm using this small thing as a greater example if a little effort yields at least a step forward on what the next question is then; take notice of what you can start to accomplish when you try. ..I met a guy in early sobriety that would always pick apart the smallest stories in life to illustrate different ideas. Change control power powerlessness beauty connectedness. There's small examples of these things all around us if we look and he brought my attention to looking. ..So what I really have taken to doing in my life is taking the small things and tuning into them. Appreciating each little thing (yes I have a gratitude practice going on in my head lots of the time) and looking to see how little things can be built upon. Especially important in early sobriety as sometimes the difficulty and feelings can be overwhelming. Be well my friend. Keep trying and; look what we can do.
Hi Gucci. Sometimes the flair link is buggy. Please message us directly from a PC by [clicking the "message the moderators" link shown here.](https://imgur.com/ZnifzVn)..If you're only able to use mobile go to the /r/stopdrinking subreddit from your reddit app and click the 3 little dots in the top right corner and a menu will come up. Click "contact mods". ..Either way just tell us what your quit date is in format MM/DD/YYYY and we will be happy to get your flair set up for you. Best of luck friend.
Im struggeling cravings at the moment too. Have been able to shut my addiction brain off and told it to fuck off once it starts tempting me and giving me ideas. But last night I listened. I didnt act on it but I didnt tell it to fuck off. Neither did I today. ..Thankful Im currently waiting for a therapy session at my rehab. Talking to others has helped me snap out of it before. Please do feel free to share more about your struggle. Let us not drink today!
