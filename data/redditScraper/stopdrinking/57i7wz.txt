I've been struggling with alcohol addiction mainly due to anxiety for many years until the stuff almost killed me which began a period of abstinence. This then gave me a feeling I was invisible as I went back to normal life back to work and inevitably stated drinking again. Then I was involved in a nasty car accident caused by my drinking which lead me down an awful path of guilt which I numbed with yet more alcohol. I was so embarrassed by the whole situation I ran away to a different part of the country where luckily I ended up at a detox centre where I've been for the past two weeks I'm due to go to a residential rehab next week to hopefully. Being at the detox centre has been nothing short of amazing being able to be totally honest about my addiction! I feel more positive about my mental health than I have done in years! I think rehab will only improve me more! I just wanted to share this with people on here if they are apprehensive about detox or rehab. I'm my opinion it frees you from the embarrassment of addiction and the guilt you feel!

This is good news! I went to detox and rehab and agree with you wholeheartedly. Rehab laid the foundation for a lifetime of recovery. Be well!
