So it's day 14 (longest I've been sober in over a decade) and I'm really struggling with cravings today. It's a miserable day weather wise so can't even go for a walk I'm stuck at home with nothing to do and the cravings are very intense. Just looking for a bit of advice really on how you guys cope with the intense cravings when distacting yourself isn't really possible? ..The cravings havent been that bad over the past 2 weeks if I'm honest but I think the combination of being bored and alone is making them a lot worse...Keep up the fight my friends. ..IWNDWYT

I have to go to a meeting and talk to other drunks to fight the urge obsession and compulsion. Good luck I believe in you!..IWNDWYT 
it was suggested early on that i up my meetings when i feel like drinking.  
I've found coming to this sub helps a lot when I'm having a craving. I've also completed some quick and random projects around the house to keep myself busy: re-potted all my house plants painted a bird house organized my linen closet and kitchen junk drawer etc...The small tasks help me concentrate on something else and also give me a small sense of accomplishment. Hope this helps. IWNDWYT.
I use the 4-7-8 breathing technique. Pretty good. Im putting down cigarettes at the same time and it makes me calm (er ...xd)
