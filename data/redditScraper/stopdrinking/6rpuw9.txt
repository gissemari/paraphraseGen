It's like being a teacher in kindergarten or zookeeper in a cage with monkeys..For your customers it's just a good night out. For a bartender it's an another day a week month years of dealing with drunks and alcohol. It is full of temptations..I would like to be the greatest bartender in the world. For me it's a vocation. But it's hard now to escape alcoholism and at the same time doing my best at work. I drink a bit when I'm working up to 2 beers for 8 hours but after my shift ends going home I buy 4-6 beers sometimes I have spirit by my side. Then I try to relax. At home I drink:.-after I saw old customer cheating on his/her spouse. .-after I take a shower and clean someone's blood from the time that I split up fighters. .-sometimes I just feel like drinking after arguing with drunks all night and my steps lead me to the nearest 24/7.-Not mentioning personal problems that I have to hide behind a smile for 8 hours. It exhausts although I know that drinking won't solve problems just make them less important at the time help me to cope with them later..After I start to drink myself to sleep and before I actually go to bed usually I write 1 poem or 3 white ones (Besides bartending writing is another most important thing to me. Did you know that 75% of literature noble laureates were an alcoholics? 20% lived in countries where drinking is culturally prohibited and only 5% were sober because of their will)..It's my vocation as I said but I had enough brain fog or tiredness after drinking. After all it's a poison and I know it best observing some clients. Yet it helps me to write. .My father was a drunk and it strongly influences me. It was two side coins for me. For once I would like to guide troubled souls just being there for them take their troubles on my shoulders. But on another side through my childhood I saw way too much of drinking to be a straight citizen. What can I do without changing job and passions. For me it is an eternal struggle to do what I love to create to be sober..I count on any readers opinion. Just write what you think.

That was nicely written and I definitely don't think I could handle bartending..least of all while trying to stay sober. Have you ever seen any couples fighting or one hit or slap the other ?
