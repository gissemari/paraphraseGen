I had the most terrifyingly vivid time lapse/relapse dream last night where I got hammered drunk with an old toxic friend while my kids were there made my 5 year old son stay out with me til 4:30am drunk drove him home and made him stay awake for the rest of the night where he saw me stumble around and fall down several times. The dream then continued through the entire next hangover day at a volunteer event with my parents and sisters. I felt like shit but not as bad as I expected (maybe my subconscious can't even get this right anymore) wondering how to explain myself to anyone. I emailed to get my badge reset (I love how this is always in there) and spent a few hours wondering if these last two days were really real and finally concluded that this was real and I have to deal with it and just start over. .Epic tale of failure by Dream Me that rattled Real Me for a solid hour this morning. I have a lot of these and often write about them here but this one was truly amazing how it went on for 2.5 days while I slept for 7 hours. ..Anyway then I absolutely kicked ass at work today in every way possible. Great day... time to go not drink with my wife and all of you.

Sounds like a vivid reminder to keep you on track followed by a kick ass day at work.  Overall I would say that's a win.  IWNDWYT!
What a vivid dream! Sounds like it was reinforcing your lifestyle now since you went ahead and had such a good day. IWNDWYT 
A great day prefaced by a horrible night!  Strange but it must have been such a *relief* to wake up to your great reality.
