Ignore badge/relapsed/field-experimented etc etc. Important thing is I'm not giving up. Had a solid day 2 today. I told one of my besties about my struggles with alcohol. I realized part of why I've not told people the depth of my problem is maybe in an effort to protect my drinking spaces. Starting to tear down those defenses. Anyway it's bedtime and I'm going to bed sober.

Good for you mate.  They say a problem shared is a problem halved.  Many of us have relapsed.  Keep at it as one of these days we will crack it...I'm on day 3 now.  I've not told anyone so far except my flatmate.  ..Have a good night's rest and keep up the good fight.
Protecting your drinking spaces I understand that. If you tell others they will naturally want to steer you away from alcohol the next time you meet. Or be constantly watching you just in case. ..Congratulations on continuing the good fight! IWNDWYT  
I kept failing until I started not being ashamed of it and hiding it.   .When I started telling people I would be accountable to other people than myself... Because being accountable to only myself have not worked so far.  ...I have a lot of days now where I know if no one else knew I would hit the clubs etc with some friends.   .But since they know and my family etc know I ve quit - It means I fail more than just myself if I relapse.  ...It seems I can survive disappointing myself but the thought of disappointing family and close people - That s scary for me.  ...Hope that helps
I find it interesting what you say about "drinking spaces" and tearing down those defenses...I really get that and it resonates with me. I have to give that some thought.
