Coming off a two day bender here.  Without going into details I've breaking up with my ex for about a month.  He's vindictive angry and full of hate at me and isnt shy about telling me....over and over again.  I should not have let the angry texts and phone calls get to me but I did and I caved.  I blocked the number deleted Facebook now I've gotta get sober all over again.  I also got assigned a super top-secret job for work and I have to pull myself together work this weekend and deliver like never before.  I'm so stressed I could scream but I know the anxiety is only this bad because I have been drinking.  Moral of the story?  Drinking has made everything wayyyyyy worse.  Take it from a relapse-queen you're better off sober...life is so much more manageable that way.

Ughhhhh same story here with my stalker. Vengeful people are the worst. Ultimately it made me quit drinking seriously this time and now I'm here. I'm actually dealing with the panic right now and I haven't drank in a few days. Don't pick up the bottle again!!!! It just makes it so much worse. Try to stay busy. I know it's hard but keep going. Think VERY LONG TERM when it comes to YOUR plans. You will win in the end. Don't respond anymore. Just block it out. You're doing great already by deleting Facebook. I have to keep mine up and super public just to defend my reputation. Why are some people so annoying. Does your ex have a drinking problem too? My stalker does. I think that causes a super vengeful attitude. 
Hang in there. Try some meditating and some exercise. It helps a lot. Stay safe blessed and sober.
Coming back is super hard so *congratulations* and welcome back! Sometimes it's good to just focus on you for a while. ..&gt;now I've gotta get sober all over again..What worked for you before? Do you know what you might do differently?
