I'm on Day 3. Unfortunately I'm in the middle of class right now. Otherwise I'd be all over it. 
Should I work out while drunk? If I've done that before is it good or bad?
Heh I would but I had a bike accident on moday and sprained my wrist. Otherwise I am totally capable of doing twenty push ups. Absolutely 110% capable. yep. Could definitely do 20 push-ups with no problem...Oh god I'm so out of shape.
I used this technique to help me quit smoking.  Every time I thought I couldn't stand it any more and that I would Scream without a cigarette.  I would drop and do push-ups pull-ups crunches etc...  Anyways It was a great help to me and it's a great distraction when a craving comes alongl
