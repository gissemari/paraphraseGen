Not sure how I found this but I've been lurking for a few months and it has really helped me make the decision to stop drinking. I'm in my late 20s and have struggled with alcohol for a long time. I don't drink everyday and I don't drink to excess everytime I drink. But it's a game of Roulette everytime I take a drink. I may stop at one or two but probably 50% of the time I will keep going until I pass out. The last couple years I've slowly started drinking by myself more and sneaking extra beers to get to the point I want to be (or rather my mind thinks I want to be). Every once in a while I will get caught or do something stupid and will stop for a few weeks. But like I've heard from many on this sub as time passes from the last incident I get lax and start moderating again. It may be a couple weeks or a couple months but EVERY time I end up back where I was waking up after a blackout and starting the cycle over again. I have everything I have ever wanted. A great job SO  a beautiful home and I know if I continue eventually I will lose it. I've started online Smart meetings and have finally joined this sub. I think the worst part is the fear of how family and friends will take my abstinence. But I will worry about that when the time comes. For today I am focusing on not drinking with all of you!

Welcome. I am also new to both reddit and this sub. My first post was the hardest so congrats for taking that step. I will not drink with you today!
Whaddup dude - its a big step to take but one that you won't regret. I feel like from what you wrote that we had similar drinking histories so I will let you know how it has worked for me. I havent had a drink for the entire month of March - and it's been really cool. There have been tests - like bowling night-  or attending a sports event with buddies dinners out with the wife (or in -laws) where I have been kind of expected to drink. All in all I still think about beer and having drinks but instead of my mind focusing on how much fun it was to get drunk now my mind feels that nostalgia and somehow my internal thoughts know that I am viewing it in rose colored glasses. Like even my mind/thoughts know it wasn't really as good as I remember. I bought a shit ton of arnold palmer iced teas and I drink those or craft sodas at night because drinking is a habit and water gets boring. ..I initially started to do this as a 90 day challenge for myself and now at day 30 - I don't know if I will go back to drinking at all when I am done. The way I feel about beers is like "Congratulations- ya just played ya self" I just feel over it. ..I'm rambling I'm giving advice I'm thinking aloud? Lol bear with me. ..I have noticeably slimmed down and I def have more energy. I'm playing guitar more again and I don't neglect normal day to day stuff like I used to. ..One of the things that drinking did to me was make me OK with mediocrity or maybe things being left undone. Like daily workouts chores cleaning etc. ..Anyhow the first couple of days were rough and tough and then there are spells of difficulty and nostalgia for it but in the end you drop a bad habit and you pick up new ones that are hopefully positive to replace them with. I definitely appreciate all the positive effects so far and I'm curious to see how much better it gets. ..Pounding mad Gatorade ;-) (And Iced tea- craft sodas coffee and waters) With you today. ..
