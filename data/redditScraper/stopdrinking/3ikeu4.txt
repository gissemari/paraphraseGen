Hi guys. It's been almost 8 month and the last couple of months have been tough for me. My frustration comes from the fact that I don't seem to be succeeding in any important areas of my life or achieving goals that I have in my head. I feel that my career is not on track and I need to get it back on track. I was nominated for promotion recently but it was put on hold due to the general business reasons not related to me. I was able to get over that and am focused on looking for other opportunities but the things that are working out are not appealing and the roles that seem appealing are not working out. ..My personal life is not entirely in a great shape. I was dating online for quite some time and met a lot of people but I can't find myself interested enough or having mental bandwidth to want to really spend time with anyone beyond the first date. ..I went back to seeing someone I broke up with once already who i truly love and enjoy spending time with but my concern is that this person is not yet ready to settle down and is not family oriented enough at this point of life. Not sure if I am just wasting my time or if it makes sense.....I have been on a project where I tend to work from home a lot lately which makes me feel disengaged and isolated. In parallel I also avoid seeing my friends because the idea of sharing my life and updates and thoughts with them feels like a lot of work and emotionally draining...I keep going strong in my sobriety but i struggle with finding happiness on a daily basis and I am constantly obsessing over these concerns and things that are not going the way I want them to. I'd like to handle things with more grace and lightness but that's just another expectation I put on myself that I can't meet. ..That's about all for tonight.

Hey hryu15533 thanks for the post. Everytime I look for happiness it eludes me. However when I'm doing something of use or being of service or making a positive contribution happiness somehow finds me! To me it's a mindset. The harder I try to be happy the more miserable I get...For my first year in sobriety i put a lot of focus on me working on me seeing counselors in my case working the 12 steps. I had to do more than just not drink. Have you done much work on yourself yet? Doing this really helped me discover a version of myself I actually liked. I was able to forgive myself. Others did too. This really helped my self-esteem and the "vibe" I gave off became very different in a good way...So to this day I still don't know how to directly find happiness but I sure have discovered a lot of the right activities that bring happiness right to my door. And I don't even have to tip. ;)

I'd like to handle things with more grace and lightness ..bingo. That's your solution...&gt;but that's just another expectation I put on myself that I can't meet. ..There's where I think you are wrong. It takes effort and I can't do it all the time but I am conditioning myself over and over to be happy no matter what happens to me. It's like an emotional muscle. It gets stronger and more automatic the more you work it...You can also condition yourself to drink at the drop of a hat when things don't go well for you. Its the same mechanism.
