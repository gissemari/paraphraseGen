Past two and half years I am into sobriety. Of course I had relapses but I knew what went wrong. And now I am more than 10 months sober. Of course sometimes it is hard but you will get used to it. Last three years I was in love. The first year we were drinking together happy and in love. But then I stopped. Everything has changed my SO got the feeling that I am not involved so much in spending time together (I also had a lot of work because it was me who was responsible for paying almost everything). My so became kinda sad and started drinking quietly. It las more than year and a half. I was crying begging my SO to stop drinking at home when I am at work or even though I am at home my SO was still drinking and thought I would not notice. I was heartbroken. I am still heartbroken but we have broken up few  weeks ago (it was from my SO intention but I was not against it). Still living together. I still like my SO but I know I am not able deal with the drinking. I tried to say that she needs help. She does not think so. I gave her money to move away from my flat but it will be possible next month. What I a trying to say is: if you are really into sobriety if you want to live normal life sometimes you need to break up with everything you had. Keep strong my friends. P.S. I am not native speaker.

Sorry it didn't work out but it's true sometimes you've gotta look forward and look out for yourself. Fantastic that you managed to stay strong. And you're English is superb for a non-native   IWNDWYT 
Thank you for sharing. That must be difficult. I think you made the right decision for yourself. It's really hard to put ourselves first but that's what sobriety is all about. Stay strong and good luck!
