Well the time has come I've been getting frustrated that I have been unable to quit for more than 2 or 3 days but I went out last night blacked out came home and went to sleep went to work severely hung over and looked at my e mail uber ride home at 1:45... well that explains it. Explains why I threw up several times today and had to come home from work ill. 2 years ago today my alcoholic father died he was a terrible human being. I think today is as good a day as any to quit. No idea how this is going to go but I need it. I'm going to spend tonight working on Valentine's Day stuff for my girlfriend and her kids for next time I see them. I would never want to bring anything like what I went thru to those children's lives. If anyone else out there is struggling with their day 1 you aren't alone. We can do this. I believe in you and I believe in me. Stay strong all.
