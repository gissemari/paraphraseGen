I'd like to think that anyway. I'm more than just my addiction but right now I need to focus every day on my addiction to make sure I start creating the habits that make it easier to not think about drinking. The first four days were pretty easy but the last few I've been struggling. I just want to go out and drink so bad. I know that it's just that this is my Thursday and Friday routine and I need to reset it. I just started seeing a therapist and she said that just cutting out alcohol isn't enough. I've got a pleasure-seeking brain and it wants something else to make it happy. I need to figure out what that might be. We didn't have enough time in therapy to go over it yet but I'm open to suggestions?

Exercise helps
My first month i built 2 model cars and finished one I started years ago. I think keeping busy is the key. Going tho the gym 5 days a week helps me too. Drinking out of boredom is less tempting when you're tired and ready for bed at 9:30.
Exercise. Rock climbing. Volunteering. Bike ride. Learning something new. Eating spicy food also can trigger some happy brain stuff. Yoga. Cooking. Hiking...You probably have some extra time on your hands how that you used to spend drinking/hungover! It's nice to just dabble in a bit of everything until you find what works. Exercise is my number one happy mood lifter. Never fails.
"I need to focus every day on my addiction..." Or maybe you could focus every day on the new habits you are cultivating? Sometimes a some reframing can be a big help...As for things that give me pleasure exercise Lego puzzles and being in nature are all "good" fixes.
