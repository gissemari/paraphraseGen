Whew! Such a better day today. I was feeling stagnant at 30 some odd days and I relapsed into blackout drunk. Today my mind is much more clear and my goals are solidified. I wasn't sure in that month if I really needed to quit. Now I know. IWNDWYT

Glad those clouds are lifting!  If I know one thing about myself now it is that not drinking makes my life better.  IWNDWYT
