Got up early this morning to enjoy a cup of coffee in front of the fire with my cat let the rest of the house sleep. Adult kids are finally home and we're getting ready to enjoy Christmas. Between friends and family it will be a very very busy few days. Normally a year ago this peaceful morning would hav been consumed with inner head conversations of either  why did I get so shit faced again? Or  please please promise yourself you won't overdo it tonight'.......or even bracing myself for the look of disappointment on my husband's face as he came down for breakfast. ..Instead there's a ton of room in my head this morning for reflections on what has nearly been a year and gratitude for everyone her who helped me along the way. House is decorated kitchen is clean and stocked and menu meticulously planned. I even made homemade bread and cheese......Merry Christmas everyone. For those of you struggling hang in there. It's a hard journey but a worthy one. Peace to all.
