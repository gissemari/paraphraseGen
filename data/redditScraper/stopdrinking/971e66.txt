Hello hello hello! I hope everyone is having a good Monday!..This is kind of weird and I wasn't sure about posting this but I just wanna get it out. ..I have had many dreams where I drink or relapse. And I'm always full of those same emotions. Plus I am upset I'm still dreaming of drinking. I know it happens but it's frustrating. ..Well in my deep slumber last night I had another dream regarding alcohol. I wasn't drinking but everyone else was at this party. Eventually I'm critizized for not drinking and told to drink or leave. Well I just about lost it getting pretty aggressive about peer pressure and all of that. Basically just said eff you all I'm going home. It wasn't a good dream considering I dream-fought with people I love (who would never act that way to begin with) but I was kind of happy. Like my subconscious finally has caught up.  I feel somewhat of a releif. ..I don't drink in my real life I also don't drink in my dreams now. I can get down with that! ..I will not drink with you today
