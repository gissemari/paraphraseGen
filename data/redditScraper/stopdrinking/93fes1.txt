Unfortunately I've relapsed hard. I'm so disappointed in myself.  I have the worst hangover right now. It's hard to even type this. The shame is back in full force. I want to quit again but I also don't. I was doing so well. I felt better than I had in years. Why do I think that few hours of "fun" is worth this? I HATE alcohol! All I know in this moment is that I will not drink today!

I did 30 days sober then crashed and drank hard for 2 and a half months. I had to pull myself back to sobriety cause the alchohol was killing me. It will be 3 weeks tomorrow and I am feeling really good. You can do it! IWNDWYT. Hugs.  
 My hangovers and anxiety became so debilitating that the few hours of drinking wasn't worth it. In the end you may want to ask yourself a different question: is it really that fun? Once I really thought about it drinking had lost its "fun" decades ago. What the hell was I doing to myself?    .IWNDWYT
