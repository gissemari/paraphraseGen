Hey everyone it's Wednesday that means the week's half over! How's it been going? Share your triumphs struggles or just general chat!..Triumph: Spoke to my sponsor about an amend that was weighing on me.  In his opinion I did nothing wrong and bringing it up may hurt the person more than help.  I feel pretty relieved...Struggle: Personal struggles with a member in AA.  I've tried to be friends with them over the last year but it's time to accept I don't like being around them...General chat: Goodbye Summer we hardly knew ye...Have a great 24 hours folks!
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph: I am actually gaining muscle again for the first time in a good year and a half! ..Struggle: Came away from a seminar yesterday feeling like I was missing the basics to even participate. Like if I had been hired to be a chemist but forgotten how pH works. I know academia is rife with people feeling inadequate but I still struggled hard to overcome my knee-jerk desire for a drink to take the edge off. Instead I DID SOMETHING about it! Like pragmatic! Woohoo!.
Triumph: sober! One day at a time. So far turned everything in for my classes which is a good start! Also happy with my new job...Struggle: I'm not white knuckling it but I am aware that I am closer than ever and just a day away from drinking/using and I can't figure out why. Prayer meditation talking service work...General Chat: anyone know about the Enneagram? We have to study it at work. No idea my type. .
Triumph: I went to my first Spanish class yesterday (post-beginner level) and the topic was good &amp; bad habits. I had the following conversation: "No bebe alcohol." "Tampoco un vaso en un restaurante?" "No nada" :-) The class was fun too and I was pretty confident and not afraid to make mistakes...Struggle: I'm going to a music festival on an island here in the Netherlands with a bunch of close friends (all of whom know about my quitting). I'm looking forward to not being hungover in my tent enjoying the sea nature and the music; but I always went with my ex the previous years so it'll be difficult at times. It's not a 100% 'safe' environment under my control but I'm in good company and I'm not going to worry overmuch but focus on my new plans...General chat: The weekend weather is looking pretty awesome 25C ain't bad for early September. I'm lucky to have a long weekend now :-)
Triumph: It's a gorgeous sunny morning and I'm not hungover...Struggle: I choose not to struggle...Chat: I'm going to change the pinion seal on my Jeep. If I get it done in time I'll drive to the noon meeting with the top down. Sober life is good.
Yay hump day!  Love short work weeks! ..Triumph: I was able to deal with a late night work issue. Wasn't drunk got the messages and was able to respond with good recommendations.  I've also started to cook delicious food again and take care of my body as well as my mind. ..Struggle: I've started to see my family differently since being sober.  Not sure if I want to be around them much anymore.  ..General chat:  has anyone felt differently about the people closest to them since becoming sober?  How did you deal with it?  I now see my family as drunken idiots.  They are loud and obnoxious.  But they are my brother father mother and at times spouse. My family.  I can't just remove them all from my life.  Any suggestions?  I don't want to preach sobriety on them either. ..Happy September 4th everyone!  Make the most of it! 
**Triumph**: I played in my first tennis tournament this weekend.  I played really well and made it to the finals.  I lost to someone that outplayed me but I feel really good about how I did and how far I've come in the last year (especially obviously the last 9.5 months)...**Struggle**: Very busy at work.  I've gotta buckle down...**General Chat**: Summer is waning.  It's been awesome: the bike rides the tennis matches the long walks with the dogs and the wife.
Triumph: I'm feeling strong going into Day 2..Struggle: The upcoming weekend... I suppose I should treat Friday just like today.
Triumph: Seeing results at the gym that I've never ever seen. I'm friggin ripped!..Struggle: Being at restaurants is brutal for me. I don't think I can handle it. Which is sad because eating out is my favorite thing to do in the world. Went out with a girl on Saturday night and felt like I needed to jump out of my skin watching everyone drink wine and beer with dinner. It didn't make me want to drink at all it just made me feel like an outsider in an environment that I used to love. I'm pissed off about this...General chat: NFL returns tomorrow night. All is well in the universe again!
**Triumph:** I've been enjoying renewing old and neglected friendships during these last few months. At the same time I've enjoyed growing some newer ones. ..**Struggle:** Relationships changing can also be challenging to figure out for me because I don't yet trust that I've gotten to equilibrium in this process. If there is such a thing...**Chat:** First day of school for the kids. They are *so* excited. I note that for me this ups the social ante as I need to coordinate rides and just know what's going on. I'm behind in getting our shared calendar online and it's like flying blind. Will fix. 
Triumph: Our kitchen remodel didn't go as planned I adapted let it go and fixed what I could. ..Struggle: My biggest struggle right now is the LSATs. I go from "I fucking hate this and don't want to be a lawyer" to "Meh not so bad maybe it will be okay" every day. ..General chat: football eh? ..

Triumph: went for a long run/walk in new shoes. They were super comfortable!..Struggle: general nervousness over what the future will hold the first time I'm in a situation where I would normally be drinking (big groups. I don't drink alone and rarely do when in smaller groups). Any insights or advice on this one?..Chat: on this side of the world it's spring! I'm really loving all the sunshine.
I always feel like these are asking me in particular how I am at first glance. every time lol
Triumph - Got married on Saturday - I managed to get through bar hopping on Friday night (three bars in 5 hours) sober for my bachelor's party I got through the rehearsal dinner (5 hours of open bar and family) and I got through my wedding sober which was also about 5 hours of open bar all around me and family.  This weekend was my ultimate challenge but I managed to get through it all because I kept telling myself "If I have a drink at my bachelor's party I'm going to get drunk at the rehearsal dinner and my wedding."  Then at the rehearsal dinner it was "If I drink that margarita I'll be hammered at my wedding." I am supremely proud of myself...About 4 months ago when I quit drinking I told myself "My bachelor's party will be the next time I drink..." and after 4 months of sobriety it's weird how you change.  It's definitely been good for me...STruggle - See above but it ended well...General chat - Hotels that charge for wi-fi are fuckers.  Especially in the year 2013.  
Triumph - I'm finally getting back on track for training for my first triathlon in two weeks. I signed up last spring and trained all summer except these past few weeks... Training is easier too since I stopped drinking and smoking (had to give both up at the same time since they're each others' triggers)...Struggle - I'm really nervous about this tri! It's my first! Will I live? Will I die? Time will tell. But I figured if Diana Nyad can swim 110 miles at 64 years old I really have no good excuse at 37...General chat - my SO is out of town for a few days and I'm really looking forward to.... Housecleaning! I'm one of those weird folks who can only clean when everyone is out of the way and I'm totally alone. Pump up that music yeah!!! ;-P..
I bought beer. It's in my car...Son of a bitch.
