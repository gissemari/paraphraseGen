I relapsed on 6/30 so today is day 5. I'm at home waiting for my work to call me so I can meet with my "advocate" and HR due to my relapse being at work. I'm so stressed and nervous and I just hate what alcohol has done. And yet what do I want to do right now? Go to the store and buy a bottle. ..It's taking every thought I have to not get in the car right now. I texted my sponsor but she hasn't responded yet (she's at work). Nothing in the house looks good to eat so that's what my brain is using as an excuse to go to the store. Plus it's literally like 1 minute away from my house...I'm trying to stay strong. What if work calls me to come in for a meeting and I've had a drink? Not good. Never good. I never want to make such a fool of myself again. ..I don't know just need someone.

I am on day 3 after my relapse and at home alone my anxiety is eating my up inside.  You are not alone.
You can do it. Take it one minute at a time and play the tape forward. I believe in you.
Ah the food run that is really more of a booze run.  Definitely been there.  There is nothing so good out there that it is worth the temptation in my experience.
