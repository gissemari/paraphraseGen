I'm coming up on three years sober and I can't help but think of how amazing life is today.  I went from being jobless living out of garbage bags and utterly hopeless to a sober woman with an apartment job family and healthy relationship filled with love and honesty.  What keeps me sober today is helping others who struggle with alcoholism and guiding them to see there is a beautiful life on the other side of this disease.  I express gratitude everyday for the life I now have.  I would love to hear some of the things you're all grateful for today!
