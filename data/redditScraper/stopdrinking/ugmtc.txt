I've been struggling with alcoholism for many years and have quit for small time frames in the past. I am committed to stopping for good but  today even with detox/tremors meds prescribed the withdrawals were terrifying and I had a drink. Specifically I had feelings of Depersonalization and that really freaked me out. I caved and drank. How does one get through the scary withdrawals without locking themselves in a padded room?..EDIT: I want to thank everyone who commented for their help. You guys really don't know how much it means to me. I don't have anyone I can talk to about this stuff right now and I didn't expect a group of strangers to step in and offer support. So thank you.

Go to the hospital. Seriously. That's how I got into inpatient detox. I went to bed after drinking woke up starting to have withdrawls and went to the ER.

Withdrawal sucks.  But it's temporary.  You have to go into knowing that your head won't be right for a few days and you have to be ready to just tough it out no matter what comes your way.  Walk through hell to get to heaven.  Or something like that...Find something you can lose yourself in.  For about a week I spent nearly every free hour I had playing Minecraft.  Hardly any sleep in there.  Minecraft is great because it's simple it's largely mindless &amp; it lets you be as creative as you want to be.  You can lose yourself in it.  Considering how it helped me get through that first week it might be the best $30 I've ever spent.  And I'm not even a "gamer."  There's a free trial available if you're interested.
