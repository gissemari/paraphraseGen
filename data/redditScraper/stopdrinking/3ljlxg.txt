I am looking at taking a holiday with my mom in February of 2017. I wanted to give myself lots of time to emotionally prepare because being around her is difficult. I held a lot of resentment towards her. Through therapy I have learned to be compassionate. She too is an alcoholic as was her father. She had a really crappy childhood and experienced different types of abuse...For my brothers weddings we promised each other we would be sober. I am proud to say that I made it through sober. I could smell the alcohol on her breath but I didn't say anything. At this point I need to let her make her own choices. And let her know that I support her and love her...Am I crazy for going on a holiday with my alcoholic mother? I know she will drink but I know she will hide it from me. I'm giving myself lots of time before the holiday to build up my sobriety in a bunch of different ways and if I relapse which I really don't see happening I can always reschedule...With the amount of sobriety that I have I feel strong enough to book this vacation. And I think it is really important. I have lost a lot of family members these past two years. Grandparents my uncle a few weeks ago and my cousin suicided a year ago. It made me realize that life is short and my mom with all of her faults raised me to be the woman that I am today.

Are you crazy for embracing life on life's terms?  Nope.  Are you smart to remain daily vigilant and maintain a plan for staying sober?  Yes!..
It sounds like it is far in the future. So you can be prepared. Worst case scenario if you do not feel prepared you have a lot of time to reschedule/cancel.
