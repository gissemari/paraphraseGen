I got out of an alcohol treatment yesterday afternoon and today is 59 days. This is the longest I have had since sometime around November when I relapsed while working in a treatment center myself. Been in AA consistently (and reluctantly) for 2 years and on-and-off before then. This was my fifth in-patient treatment. Have to do something different this time... I'm in a house with alcohol and my license was taken away so I'm posting in here. Not drinking today. Glad I found you all.

Glad you're here congrats on the 59 days! That's quite some time from my point of view. Well done!
In the beginning of my sobriety I went to lots of different meetings. Some were good and some less so. I always got something out of them and have settled one the ones the help me improve my life the most. AA has helped me quite a bit but I understand there are many roads to take to stay sober for this 24 hr period. I hope you find the path that works for you..
