Hey everyone I've been lurking on the sub for a while but this is my first time posting a thread. I've been trying to drink less but I've been struggling a lot because I'm in college. The thing is that my friends/roommates only drink at parties or when they drink other times it's easy for them to stop. It's different for me I feel like every Friday and Saturday night I'm just waiting for 5:00 so I can start drinking. The thing I'm worried about now is that in 10 days I'm turning 21. My parents are going to take me out on Thursday night then I'll have a party Friday night followed by my college's first football game Saturday night then we have school off for Labor Day. I'm afraid that that weekend coupled with the fact that alcohol will be so much more accessible to me could really send me down a tough path. I guess my question is what are some things you guys would have loved to have told yourselves when you could sense yourself having a problem but weren't there yet? Thank you all so much for reading and for the inspiring stories I see here all the time. IWNDWYT.

Look up the local AA meetings...I'm sure there will be some near the school...Good luck!
Welcome aboard!..I wish I'd got sober when I was 21 instead of nearly 33 don't squander the opportunity.....There was a [post earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/98xjwr/any_other_college_students_in_this_sub/) from another sober college student go and say hi!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Well it will be a challenge but you already know that.  I can only say resist when you're with those who are drinking around you and when alone have something already pre-planned so you can take yourself safely away from the alcohol and temptation.  Like a road trip a biking trip a hiking trip you get the idea.  One good thing you can look forward to is no hangover!  Good luck!
