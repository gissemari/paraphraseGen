:)..All I can say is... if I can do it ANYONE can do it. I've been a long-time habitual relapse-r and been around here since I think 2012 stringing together a month or two here or a moth or two there.. but having gotten a sponsor and worked the AA program (Not perfectly mind you) so far so good :)

There's an old-timer in one of the meetings I go to who when it's time to give out chips and it comes around to the 9 month chip says "Nobody ever gets that one" so I can't wait to see his ass in a meeting this week ha.
it takes 9 months to GROW A NEW PERSON.  so do you feel like you've grown into new person??
Congrats.  That is a bunch of days you have strung together.  
Well done!!!!
Nine months is an awesome time in sobriety. I love to see a celebration! Enjoy that chip too
Wahoo!!!!
