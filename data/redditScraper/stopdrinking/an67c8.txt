So I went to a superbowl party last night and while I did wind up drinking I noticed things were different than they've been when I relapsed in the past.  ..  ..In the first I'd been making conscious efforts to avoid the liquor table. Before I would have rocketed straight there barely after making introductions; because of this avoidance I was able to catch up with some family I haven't seen in a few years (and even made plans to hang out with them tomorrow.)  ..  ..Second: what got the better of me was curiosity rather than the force of habit. I'd never had a jello shot before and since there were trays and trays of them I figured "well why not this once." Having had one I've satisfied my curiosity and now know that I wasn't missing much.  ..  ..Third: while I did wind up drinking more than I intended (because of course I did) I was \*present\* for each of the drinks rather than just mindlessly inhaling them like I had in the past. I've been aggressively counting my calories for the past couple weeks and while I knew I blew my diet the second I walked into the party (a family friend brought home smoked BBQ with four kinds of sauces; I was doomed) I was not about to exacerbate it by drinking excessively. I even cut myself off; I left half a bottle of wine at the bar where before I would have taken the whole thing with me like a can of soda and damn the calories. ..  ..Fourth: my liver having dealt with my poor choices for a while helpfully cleared everything out of my system and served me up a potent hangover before I even left the party. I slept so poorly last night that even though I got home before midnight I fell asleep right around sunrise. It was a condensed prompt reminder of the price I pay whenever I drink. ..  ..I'm writing this because when we relapse some of us tend to focus on the failure and the "fall from grace" that has happened instead of the progress we've made along the way. Four months ago when I started my journey toward sobriety the idea of even going a few days without ANY kind of alcohol was unthinkable. Old me would have drained that bottle of wine dry and had a few more been stumbling around the party making an ass of myself and probably would have either left early or been asked to leave.  ..  ..But new me had a nice time for the whole party has had a good time today and only feels a little bad that he'll have to walk for a week to work off just one of those plates of BBQ.  ..  ..I slipped up but I'm getting better. IWNDWYT guys. :)

I've had 10/12 months sober.  Getting back to it was as eye opening as falling back into the hole.  Like you I was more aware even as I was falling.  And it sucked worse than I even remembered it.  I'm not getting cocky I still have too many temptations.  Things sure are better on this side of the decision.  Good luck keep at it.  IWNDWYT.
