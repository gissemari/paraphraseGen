Has anyone tried hypnotherapy to cut down or stop?  I had my first session the other day and to test it went out for a drink and while I was in a pretty good place I didn't drink any less than normal...Roll on Sunday and I get a call from my parents (both 68) to say my sister (42 lives with them....long story) has had another alcohol related episode in conjunction with her depression and other mental health issues which has resulted in her slapping and scratching my mum threatening my Dad with a knife and ultimately slashing her own arm. Subsequently she has damaged nerves required surgery and has now been admitted to a Psychiatric unit. (We have been struggling to get her the right help for a long time)..Anyway I now think that given my own habits and reflecting on hers that perhaps I should stop altogether and wondered if further hypnotherapy might help...If it helps me it may also help her?..Thanks for any feedback x

Interesting! I have not heard of hypnotism for alcoholism but my father was successfully hypnotized to quit smoking cigarettes. (he got sober on his own though)
I love hypnotism now (not the theatrical kind).  I used it actually to stop stressing out at work.  I listened to all night sessions on YouTube while sleeping it was great because the suggestions sink in with repetition.
