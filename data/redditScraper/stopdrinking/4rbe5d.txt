I have been lurking here for about 3 months and finally decided to post. I had stopped drinking for 21 days thanks to God and you people here. But I relapsed over the weekend and now feel like complete garbage. I have my usual anxiety and insomnia. I am so done with alcohol. .So right now I have this feeling of anger instead of fear of the alcohol and what it has done to me in my life. I don't know if that's the right way of looking at it but I feel more empowered by the anger than by the fear. .Anyway I am starting over again at day one and praying for strength. Thanks for any encouraging words.

Welcome friend. Glad you are here. Stick around for a chat and what not. Not drinking with you today. 
Thank you. I won't drink with you today.
Welcome! I am so glad you posted. I always felt really awful after a relapse. What I tried to do is use relapses as an opportunity to add to my recovery program.
Welcome. What helped me early on was to figure out how the decision to drink happened and the steps that I could take the next to avoid drinking. 
So glad you're here. ..Don't beat yourself up too much over it? We've all been there honestly. ..For me the important thing I got out of a "slip" after a brief period of sobriety was the realization that I had a "gap" in my plan. In other words I hadn't stayed one step ahead of my disease and thought out fully how to avoid that first drink. ..If you have a moment take a little time to figure out what you could have done differently to avoid the situation. ..But again don't beat yourself up over it and we're super glad you're here. ..Best Punnyboy
