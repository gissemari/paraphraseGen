I posted before but I did go off the rails for 3 days and was miserable and mean to my husband (blacked out). It's now been 2 weeks and I have not only stopped drinking but my entire house is getting cleaned. I've been working my ass off and it's so nice to feel accomplished and see the results. I still struggle at night (husband drinks beer) because I feel so bored. Hopefully that will be a little better soon as I am organizing my ton of craft stuff and I am going to start a project soon.
