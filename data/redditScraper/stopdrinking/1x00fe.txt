I'm starting my second month of sobriety. I know that since a few days ago when I sat in my first AA meeting that my life changed forever. I went as a last minute decision because I felt bored and I thought I'd just try it. I realized while sitting in that room with everyone that I was just like them with my alcohol addiction. I belonged there. Right now I am still exploring some ideas. I'm reading the 12 steps and writing down whether or not I agree with them. I'm being very specific like an essay. It's helping me to sort out my thoughts. What I am discovering is that I am terrified of relapse. I know that I have a solid three months without a problem. The three months after that I might struggle slightly but I'll make it. Eventually I'll hit a snag and start reevaluating my commitment. I know how my mind works. I'll "forget" not to drink.  .I'm trying to prepare as best I can for that. I'm collecting stories about other peoples experiences. Most of them are really sad. Last week the Discovery Channel aired a documentary called "Drugged - High on Alcohol." I will never forget it. The story is intensely sad. If you haven't seen it you can watch it on youtube.  The kid's name is Ryan.  .After hearing the news about Philip Seymour Hoffman (I heard this right after getting out of my first AA meeting) I read about him. He was sober for 23 years.  .I think that these stories are important to remind us how serious it is. And I also think it is important to talk about the success stories. I like balance and I believe in positive thinking.  .What success stories do you know about?  .  .Ryan:  .https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dJ97Vwoup4

On Saturday in an AA meeting I listened to a woman who was 39 years sober talk for about 20 minutes about her life. Yesterday in another meeting I listened to another woman who was 36 years sober tell her story. Keep going to AA meetings and you'll hear them. You'll hear people who have been much longer sober than they were drinking. You have to got to a lot of meetings though to hear them because they are so God damn serene and humble they don't talk much they just glow with love and compassion and spend most of their time sponsoring people one to one outside of meetings...You'll find recordings of thousand of recovered alcoholics here:-..http://www.xa-speakers.org/..specifically..http://www.xa-speakers.org/pafiledb.php?action=category&amp;id=1..are some of my favourite individual speakers are:-..- Micky B(ush).- Clancy I.- Sandy B(each).- Ray O.- Adam T.- Earl H(ightower).- Dave M.- Vince Y.- Kip C ..They are all 20 30 40 years plus sober...Also Joe and Charlie go through the book and the 12 steps like you are doing in a series of talks which I found very useful - ..http://www.xa-speakers.org/pafiledb.php?action=category&amp;id=13..All of these are mp3 files and free to download.....Good luck - and keep going back the most hopeful stories I've heard are not on tape.

I keep going to meetings even after 22 years.  I need constant reminding.  Slow learner and fast forgetter.  I am pretty sure I only need 3 meetings a week but I try to get to 5 because I don't know which ones they are.
