Im new here and look forward with interest to reading and sharing the experiences we have. Hello to everyone.   So another year gone and noooo drinking. In fact a year and a half now without it and never really been tempted. The thought only crosses my mind when  someone who doesnt know me well says " come and have a few" lol. Think I made myself so ill the very last time my body just baulks at the thought of it. I never liked the taste of it much anyway and thought I liked the effect but it just made me want to do as little as possible. I know many people struggle with this and i just keep going. For me it's a much better life to be having. Good luck.
