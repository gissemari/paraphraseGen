At first I was extremely nervous but by the end of the meeting I felt almost at ease. I know that will become easier the more meetings I attend. I had no idea what to expect...only what I saw on television. I actually did some research on what to expect when you attend an AA meeting (which I feel silly about now). The step we discussed was the step of understanding humility which I felt was perfect because in order to work up enough courage to go I had to really let go of a lot of my fears of what I want right now and how I view myself. I wish I had let it go a while ago...but I cannot dwell. I'm proud of myself for going and wanting to get better. I know I have support through my family and others that struggle and want to get better too and that feels really good. I feel more at peace tonight than I have in a while. A very long while and wanted to share my experience!

This is a great post....I really enjoyed reading it.  Thank you for taking the time to share and keep it up!
I'm trying to determine whether meetings are right for me or not and this post helped push me in the "go to the dang meeting" direction. Thanks!
Congratulations in making an important step.  I was terrified to go to my first meeting but I really look forward to going now.  
I started going back to AA tonight following a failed start in January. Being an alcoholic means having to live through all manner of self-inflicted humiliations and everybody in the room is the same in that regard. Therefore I think that nobody in an alcoholic recovery group with half a brain is going to be judging or looking down upon anybody else.
keep going back it get's better.
