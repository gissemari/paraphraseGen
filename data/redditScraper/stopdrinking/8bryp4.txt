So I relapsed. I've been drinking daily for two weeks now after 4 months sober. ..I can sit there and beat my self up about it but why? This guilt is doing nothing for me...Back to day one.

Today is a new day - onwards and upwards!..Every slip-up is an invitation to reflect on what you might do differently the next time around......I won't drink with you today!..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
I will not drink with you today.
Great news thats the only way we will move forward and we are all here for you  
Good luck. IWNDWYT 
I'm thankful to whatever happened to get you back here!  I will not drink with you today friend.
Recovery my dude. I believe you can get back to a good place and not drink today with us! 
It's ok it's great that you're back on track. I know it's hard to feel this way after having slipped up but you should feel really proud that you didn't just give up completely. I'm proud of you for picking up where you left off... we're all here for each other and you can do this.
  way to keep going !
Just get back on it...You did it before. Keep at it.
