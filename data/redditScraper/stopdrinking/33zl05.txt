It's my Mom's birthday and also the 3 year anniversary of my arrest date. I'm looking at my progression. Sure I've made steps. I'm less angry less tense... I've been noticeably more sober the last three years... relapsed twice... been to dozens of meetings (therapy and batterers intervention). Sometimes I wish I could say I've done more but time only moves one day at a time and that's the best anyone can do. I've made amends with my Dad - we're as distant as ever. We've never been close. It's not like I can judge but he's probably the second worst alcoholic I've ever seen. He began his abuse of us when I was in the 4th grade. The night I was arrested it was because I drunkenly assaulted him. I had finally had enough after he became abusive toward my Mother on her birthday. I snapped... had a full blown PTSD flashback. I don't remember how many times I hit him. Nearly broke his nose two black eyes... he got to walk around for a few days like my Mom had to... embarrassed. It was Hell... my poor sister was witness. Words will never describe the hole in heart but I'm trying to press forward.

I've spent too much of my life thinking about the things that have gone wrong that I wish I could change.  A lot of my drinking was because I was afraid of moving forward...You definitely should be proud that you're making an effort to better yourself.  A lot of people never do.  And like you said like they all say it really is the one day at a time concept.  I've been trying to practice staying right in the present moment and only concentrate on the things I can immediately effect.  Those are the things I can work on.  I can handle all the other things as they come in their own single portion.  I don't have to have to take on everything at once.  Just piece by piece and day by day.
