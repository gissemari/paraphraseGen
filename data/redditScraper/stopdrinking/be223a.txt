But it's not nearly as difficult to navigate when I am sober. I feel everything which can be bad but also very good. I am currently struggling with my current job situation and not loving the management. I am going to actively seeking new employment. My happiness comes first and I am grateful to be aware of that now. Here's to all of you our there doing the best that you can. I believe in you! IWNDWYT

Life always will be tough at times but you are so right. It is easier to deal with it sober! IWNDWYT
Nobody said getting sober was easy. But for me it is worth it.  You are a few days ahead of me and I hope it stays that way. iwndwyt

The general advice is to not make any major decisions or changes in the first year.   Once I sorted out that I was the problem and that I needed to change most of the other problems went away.  The key is patience.  This stuff does not happen overnight.  Most changes early on are what we call geographicals which is taking the problem to a new location.  You don't want to be the person with 20 different jobs in 10 years.  I tell sponsees to not even thinking about making changes until they are through step 5.  Until the accurate diagnosis has been made it would be no different than fixing a car problem by randomly swapping out parts.
