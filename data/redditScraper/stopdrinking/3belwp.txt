So I started my sober journey three months ago (end of March). I had made many attempts at moderation but this was when I actually said "time to try no more." My badge still reads three days though so why am I not discouraged and what keeps me going? ..- I haven't had a drink at a work event or trip in three months and there have been plenty of opportunities. I no longer feel tempted nor do I feel I have to say no sometimes because I don't want to get blackout. I can go and enjoy time with my colleagues. ..- I'm back at the gym my diet is better and as a result my energy levels are doing really well. My strength and endurance are almost back to where they were and my abs are clearing up again. ..- I'm remembering what it is like to have continuity in my thoughts and days. Not a life punctuated by binges and regret. And not a life where alcohol was the highlight. ..- I've regained a lot of my familiarity with my guitar and put together a new band that's been really fun and doing well. ..- I'm relearning what it means to be in touch with my emotions and aware of how they influence my day to day interactions and decisions. It's amazing how much of this skill I've let fall by the wayside. ..- I'm dealing with my father's death in a much healthier way on average. ..- I'm actually interested in having relationships again. I'm not actively working on this because I want to be in a more stable place with myself and my sobriety but I'm happy I'm back to a place where I actually don't cringe at the thought of long term. ..- I went to AA and it wasn't scary! (sang to the tune of "I kissed a girl and I liked it..."). ..I still have things to figure out. But one thing I'm damn sure of is the adage we hear here about alcohol being a mask and not drinking just being a first step. I feel like I've helped improve and patch up a lot of what I was finding difficult in my life. For that I am grateful and for this community that has helped me see on this path. ..I'll end by just affirming that none of this excuses my relapses; or rather that while I've made progress in my sobriety the point is still not to drink because through that I keep all these great things going. Without that I keep putting them in jeopardy...Edit: oh I guess it technically reads two days lol

Glad to hear it's working for you and glad you're still here. I relapsed so many times before managing to string together a decent number. It gets easier. Promise.
