Just from drinking after being just over 60 days sober. I'm 20 and in college and at the start of the year I made the decision to stop drinking mainly due to some  depression and the path I was heading  was too dark which was coupled with a porn and masturbation problem which I have refrained from doing for 70 days :).Last year I started drinking by myself most of the time or just drinking whenever I was feeling sad. I don't know if I'll be able to relate to anyone over here but alcohol in college is the norm it is the lifeblood of social life. Today I decided to drink mainly due to peer pressure and I feel sort of guilty that I had fun I finally got some action from some girl which makes me question myself whether I can hook up with girls while sober which is something that did not happen in those 60 days. During those 60 days some changes have been made in my life and the mental clarity I had from the streak was amazing...Everyday seems to be a struggle within myself with the person I want to be and the person I was. I had started medicating my issues with alcohol and it needed to stop before it was too late and after 60 days I'm sure that I do not need alcohol. I'm not sure of the answer I want to here from this sub I just have nobody to talk to in real life about my struggles. People always think I have my shit together if only they knew what really goes on inside my head. I'm not planning on drinking for a long time after this. Any people who have been in a similar situation? Any word of advice from anyone will be greatly appreciated. Thank you
