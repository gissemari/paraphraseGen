And I REALLY want a drink. I'm 74 days in and I think Friday's and warm weather are a huge trigger for me. Struggling...

It is hard with the nice warm sun and beautiful weather.  I work at a ski mountain and as you know drinking is everywhere.  I just stood outside and enjoyed a club soda letting my skin soak up the sun.  I have begun to realize how beer really inhibits your enjoyment senses. IWNDWYT 
I feel the same exact way when it's beautiful outside. Try replacing the old habit with a new healthier one! You got this! 
dang I'm up in New Hampshire and today was in the 60s and fortunately I didn't once think about booze - I just stayed busy working on my camper while the snow slowly melted around me ..the less time I sit around romanticizing about warm days and cold booze the less chance the idea becomes trapped in my head ..best to stay busy and remind myself of the dark days I no longer have to experience as long as I stay sober .
