So I know this is ironic but I think my patient relapsed and the stress of that has triggered a craving for wine. Then my husband tells me to get myself some dinner (no big deal) cuz he just got home from having a few drinks..... GAHHHHHHHH! So I'm gonna stop at the sandwich shop before I leave work go home and drink some   SMH

I'm very sorry you're struggling but how is drinking wine going to help?  Sure you might get some very temporary relief but how will you feel afterwards?  Would you be happy with yourself tomorrow if you were to drink today? Would you then just slip back into drinking regularly?  How does the thought of that make you feel?..If it were me I would get something to eat wash it down with a large amount of flavored sparkling water and then divert myself with some comedy videos.  That's just a suggestion in case you hate comedy:)! ..You're almost at two weeks!  Don't quit!  You can do it! 
Sorry to hear you are struggling. I just gave in and drank yesterday and regret every bit of it. I couldn't sleep. I was bloated. I smelled bad. I was groggy. My thinking was diminished. I couldn't be productive. I didn't even like the taste or feel of what I drank. Hold on it will get better.
