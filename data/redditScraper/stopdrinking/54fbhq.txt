As I was traveling yesterday I read through the Girl on the Train which was on the popular book rack at the drug store. I didn't know anything about it but enjoy thrillers. What I found was an incredibly accurate depiction of what it was like to be an alcoholic who blacks out frequently. I had accidentally found an author that put what waking up after blacking out was like for me every few days for years. The character's erratic behavior racing thoughts and general failure to act appropriately mirrored many of my actions (though of course not surrounded by a murder mystery).   .  .Has anyone else found any other books that hit home for them? I'm partial to fiction but occasionally enjoy an autobiography or whatnot as well. There are times I feel kind of alone in the struggle for my sobriety - my husband has never had any alcohol problems. As supportive as he is he just doesn't understand how/why sometimes in a split second I can go from totally in control to serious mental cravings.

Here's a good short autobiography by a woman who struggled with alcohol and her story of personal and professional growth :.."High Bottom: Letting Go of Vodka &amp; Chardonnay" by Tammy Roth..http://amzn.to/2bgpHrn.
