...it's strength.  Knowing when you're at your limit and asking for help takes more strength than lifting a bottle ever will...I'm struggling right now. I've been romanticizing drinking. A glass of whiskey while playing xbox or while writing or while... well the activity isn't the point. The whiskey is. And the worst part? I never drank the stuff when I did drink. ..I can't do this alone. And I don't have to. That's a strength I never had before. Today I won't drink.

For me there is no such thing as "a glass" of anything alcoholic. Proven time and time again. How I wish it were so sometimes.  It just is not. It is hard for me to stop those romanticizing thoughts once they start. But I have to focus on the shit where it leads me. Every single time. Sure I might be able to have one once but then the obsession kicks in and I am back to the old ways (or worse) in a shockingly short time. Good for you for posting what you are thinking. Keep reaching out often. It is strength! IWNDWYT
