The place that helped me finally get sober after years of trying has decided to let me come on board after two years sober. I'm so happy to give back to the place that helped give me my life back. It gives me an opportunity to help people that are in the same shoes I was in when I came here two years ago and do what others did for me. Please if you are struggling still and can't do it on your own don't be ashamed to seek help. I had to move across the country to LA to start fresh. Not everyone needs such a drastic change but I know I did. If you are like me please reach out. I'm here for you and will help in anyway I can. There's always an open bed here. It's so much better on this side of life trust me. Stay strong everyone!
