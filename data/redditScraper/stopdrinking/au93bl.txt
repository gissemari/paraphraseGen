Hey people. First of I'd like to compliment this sub! Definitely one of the more wholesome places on reddit. Thank you for being so awesome it makes me happy...Now off to my dilemma I am a 23 yo student I have a healthy social life and a bunch of people who wants to do stuff with me. However lately I've come to realize that most of these things revolve around alcohol. I've never had a drink on my own but most days I'll end up in a bar after school for a beer or two. If it is the weekend we'll all get really drunk. ...We struggle to do anything if it is not in a bar and it seems completely normal. It is what all the students do. How is this sustainable? I feel like i will be left in the cold if I try to not drink because the other people from my class will still be going out. ..I might be blinded by the people I hang out with but it truly does seem normal. .It doesn't feel normal I feel tired and unhealthy...This has been gradually building since we all started drinking at age 16-17. ..How do i handle this?..TLDR; My student buddies and I end up in bars daily and it feels bad what do i do?
