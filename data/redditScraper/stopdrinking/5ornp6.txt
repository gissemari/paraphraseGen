Hi all. First of all I need a badge reset I've been away from the sub for a while. I had a good six months under my belt was doing well then switched jobs started traveling for work started drinking once in a while while I was on the road to the point where I am drinking about once a week now. I got myself back into a relapse group through my addiction counselor but I continue to drink. ..My drinking now is much less than it has been in the past but over the last few months I can see it slowly and steadily increasing. Also in the past I would drink beer at home or at a bar but I find myself now slamming airline bottles of vodka and doing shots. Not cool...I've posted before about the fact that my husband continued to drink at home while I was clean much to my chagrin and against my wishes. I believe I have adopted a "if I can't beat him I'll join him" mentality and the idea that my marriage needs to end in order for me to maintain my sobriety is becoming more and more real to me. ..Mostly I wanted to reach out and get this out into the ether (haha). I have an appointment with my therapist next week to determine next steps but I think a move to sober living or a redo on outpatient treatment or even an inpatient stint might be unavoidable. I also struggle with borderline personality disorder so tend to treat those symptoms with alcohol and they have been increasing with winter weather and with my failing marriage. ..Thanks for reading I know this was jumbled. Like me. ..

I understood everything you said :)  I support the sober living and/or treatment program - IP or OP.  Whatever you decide I believe in you.  
I'm glad you are back and that you posted.  Sounds like you are going through a lot I'm happy that you are reaching out both here and to a therapist and are considering treatment.  I don't think any of us have been down a perfect road to recovery - so hang in there and just try to make the best next decision.  Hugs!
