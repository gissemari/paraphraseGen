So a week ago I relapsed and as usual it was horrible I got punched in the face lost my glasses and ended up with two black eyes. Spent $200 not just on booze but other substances as well. Embarrassed to go to work I had to call in and was written up. ..One week later I am home alone made dinner can't find anything to watch and not ready for bed. I think of how there is 7 different bars in walking distance and how it would be nice to just have a few by myself at the bar. ..Am I Insane!!!! I went to a AA meeting on Friday and I will go again next week but these Lonely nights always haunt my mind with thoughts of drinking

I've found it helps to have both a distraction (in my case a creative project) and support. ..It's great that you've checked in here. Writing out my frustrations loneliness etc. seems to help me make it through the temptations and keep my brain sane and on the good path.
If most of our leisure time is spent drinking we are missing out on life. I needed to get involved with hobbies my recovery-AA volunteering and healthy relationships. You're not insane just dependent on alcohol to relax. 
I was never the bar type in part because I was under 21 during my period of heavy drinking but also because it just wasn't my scene and I didn't like the idea of paying exorbitant fees for booze (e.g. $6 for a shot.) I was much more of the "buy a shitload of 40s or Steel Reserve or cheap liquor and get piss drunk by yourself at home" type...The thought of spending obscene amounts of money at a bar just to get drunk would be enough to keep me home! lol!
Find another AA meeting and go to it.
