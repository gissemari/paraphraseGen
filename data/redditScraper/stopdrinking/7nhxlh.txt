Hey guys! I'm a binge drinking and frequent relapser. My biggest problem is that when I get overwhelmed I reach for the bottle instead of calming myself down by doing something positive like meditating. Last night my husband and one of my close friends vented to me about some of their problems and I just got really overwhelmed and decided to throw everything out the window and drink..In those moments of chaos what do you do to stay in control of yourself?

I personally enjoy going back and reading my first posts on this sub. It helps me remember why I started. I also use this sub and the chat as a crutch. If I feel like I'm going to drink I'll bring it up to someone here first. 100% of the time I've been able to talk through it and not drink :)
I'm a similar drinker to you - but my trigger is social pressure rather than emotions. SMART Recovery has some practical things you can try - I've not used much yet but think I will have to...Worth looking into I think - if you google SMART recovery and urges feelings emotions etc. there will be things to read. .
