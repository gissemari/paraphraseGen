I had a really bad night last night. I ended up getting blackout and yelling at my fianc . She is the love of my life and the fact that I treated her like that disgusts me. I've struggled with alcohol and drugs for years now. My fianc  and I met 3 years ago when I was quitting harder stuff and she was my guardian angel. I never would have been able to quit those drugs without her love and support. But honestly alcohol has proven to be just as troublesome in my life if not more so than heroin. When I drink I don't have the ability to moderate at all. As soon as I have my first drink I crave another and another.  95% of the time it's fine and I have a great time with whoever I'm with even if I drink a little too much. But then there is the 5% of the time where it gets really bad. Once I blackout it's like an evil person takes over my body. I get angry and mean and say and do things that would never cross my mind when I'm sober. It's really scary how little control I have. I want to get better. I've got to stop before I ruin my relationship with the wonderful woman I love.
