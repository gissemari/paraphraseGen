So I am nearly a week without booze in my life and I am already seeing the positives; have more energy emotions arent rollercoasting sleeping patterns are nearly back to normal feel like I can tackle anything without thinking I cant cope and my sex drive has gone through the roof (though not sure if thats a positive ;)).HOWEVER; after a argument with the father of my daughter about him having her for a stopover with his family (now this is a whole other story and I am the main caretaker and he rarely sees her and has to have controlled visits with members of family around and offers no financial support) his reply:  I am not the only person who looks after our daughter. LIVID could not even begin to describe how angry I was! I then got in contact with my oldest friend who I've known 20 years explaining my current situation and apologising for not being about her reply: NOTHING!.My first reaction was to go straight to the booze but I didnt but it dawned on me I was emotionally stressed and realised that I have been drinking for emotional support: rubbish day at work 'oh I'll have a drink' bust up with family/friends/boyfriend 'oh I'll have a drink' or struggling to cope bringing up a child on my own with no financial emotional or physical support 'oh I'll have a drink'..... etc.In sunny england it is a bank holiday weekend which means bbq's and booze :/ so am looking forward to that joy!.After all that I was lying in bed and I broke down crying couldnt blame the booze or feeling hungover realised that I cant rely on many people around me and just felt down right lonely.... and then my second realisation sunk in that I always drink to escape..So anyway after that massive rant you are a saint if you stuck through that still on the first rung of a very big ladder!

Wow that sounds tough. I don't know how moms do it to be honest. You should sign up for this really good moms' (and some dads') recovery support group: [Booze Free Brigade](http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Booze_free_brigade/)..Here's the writeup: .The Booze Free Brigade - over 1000 members strong and growing......"Women (and Men) who are creating better lives for ourselves and our families by letting go of booze. Are you scared? Are you embarrassed? Are you not even convinced you have a problem but would like to explore it further? Is there a nagging voice in your heart of hearts that is telling you something's wrong? This is a great place to start. You don't have to do this alone. ..And if you have time behind you this is a great place to lend support to others who could use your wisdom!"
I'm so glad that you took the time to post and I offer you a big Internet Hug. It must be terribly tough trying to stay sober when this kind of crap falls on you.  ..Stay strong and hold to your resolve. Drinking won't make these problems easier to handle it will just add one more to the list. You sound like a strong and determined young woman building a glorious and happy future and you're doing a pretty damn fine job of it.  ..Keep it up. Your daughter will thank you.  ..Now what you need to do is treat yourself to a reward. Buy yourself some modest present...something with some permanence to it not flowers or a meal. Buy a small decorative item for your home. Something you can look at later and say "I remember the day I bought that. Those were among my darkest days but I remained dedicated to my commitment and didn't fold up under the pressure and drink. I can make it - sober - through pretty much anything."  ..Let your strength today be a reminder to be strong tomorrow.
