Hey folks..I'm new here but after a night of binging tequila I've chosen to quit. I often don't drink but when I do I black out or come close. Things at home are difficult. What's helped you cope when struggling?..Thanks in advance. And keep on keepin' on.

Exercise and just keeping busy seem to do the trick for me. Have you considered a meeting? 
To be honest what works for me is my vanity. I was drinking every day quit at the start of the year and I've lost a lot of weight..  .My "system" is that when I look at the bottle I then take a look in the mirror. .  .Sure am looking forward to being in shape :)
Welcome /u/thehawksoars to /r/stopdrinking -- in terms of what you might eat the text *Alcoholics Anonymous* suggests that candy bars or chocolate might help with cravings assuming you don't have a dietary or medical reason against consuming sweets.  But what worked for me [are the things I describe at the "Baby Steps" post which is connected to this link.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Good luck.
Thanks for your suggestions. I appreciate your help. Stay strong.
