After doing well for a couple months I relapsed last night. I feel more guilty and down about it than I have previously bc I thought I was doing so well but I feel like that is a good thing. Each time I relapse I become more determined to make a change. I look forward to the day it finally sticks. I always refer back to one of my favorite quotes when I relapse and need some encouragement maybe it will help some of you as well..."Man cannot remake himself without suffering for he is both the marble and the sculptor.".-Alexis Carrel...Just needed to get that out there to keep myself accountable. I will not drink with you today!

I love that quote! Saved your post. I read a lot of myself in it. ..I'll be not drinking right with you today!
Awesome quote and good for you for being honest and accountable. I am with you-I will not drink today. Stay positive!
Amazing quote!  And I've had so many day ones I lost count.  I try to just keep moving forward and building myself on better footing and each time I make it a little further. We are in this together; i will not drink with you!
A step along the path is the best you can do! Keep walking the walk.
