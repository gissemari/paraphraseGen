I quit for 60 days earlier this year thought I could drink casually but realized kids just not going to work. Not even one so for me. Saturday the 27th will be the last time I ingest that shit!

Good for you. I've relapsed a bunch of times and I'm starting over again. Trying to get the courage up to go to a meeting and get a one-day chip
Sometimes a relapse is needed to remind us that we cannot drink like other people not even one. Glad you are back on track.
...and shit it definitely is!
My relapse rocked my world man. It's not just the progression of the disease at work but you compound that with all that alcohol hitting a flushed out system? Shiiit. We don't stand a chance. Just like that your life can be over or ruined forever. This shit is for real.

Drinking cost me so much--the girlfriend I loved and wanted to marry relationships with my kids---and yet I have such a hard time stopping. I know a meeting will be really good---but I'm avoiding it.
good job coming back! 60 days is not something you can forget. I bet in those 60 days life tasted pretty good sober?
Glad you're here!  What are you going to do differently this time?
It takes what it takes. The important thing is you're back. Good for you. ..My relapse taught me a lot. I'm glad it happened. 
Do what I'm going to do---find a meeting tonight and go
