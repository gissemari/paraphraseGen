Hi everyone!  I've been lurking on this sub for a while and have drawn so much inspiration from you guys...I wanted to share my story.  ..I started drinking 20 years ago and haven't gone longer than a week sober since then.  I never drank moderately I always drank to get drunk.  It made for some great times when I was younger but somewhere along the way it stopped being fun and became more of a necessity for me to function especially socially...I've been drinking daily for the past 3 years and blacking out nightly for the past year and a half or so.  It started after a bad breakup and became a habit.  I was beginning to hallucinate and would get the shakes so badly that my writing wasn't readable.  Every day was a struggle to get through the work day so that I could get home and start drinking again.  I was isolated never went anywhere or did anything.  I never could remember what I ate for supper the night before or who I spoke with what was said etc.  I've been wanting to stop for over a year now and even tried an outpatient rehab which I ended up quitting after a couple of weeks because I was still drinking.  I have a dog who is my life and she was very much affected by my drinking...we didn't go on walks anymore didn't go places like the dog park and to visit friends like we used to.  I was ruining her life as well.  ..I'm extremely close with my family and a couple of friends and they knew I was having problems but they didn't know the extent of it.  The guilt was almost unbearable and the only thing I could do to manage it and the fact that I hated myself and my life was drink it away every night.  I was constantly physically exhausted and the only time I could manage to get anything done around the house was when I was plastered...I finally came clean with my Mom last week about how serious my situation is and we decided I would spend the weekend detoxing at my parents' place.  You guys I actually did it!  It was not at all easy and I did get some anti-anxiety meds from my doctor so that has helped immensely with withdrawals.  I feel so much lighter and I am just beyond excited.  I thought I was going to be stuck in that rut forever.  I spent my first night back at home last night and it went surprisingly well.  ..I know I'm not out of the woods yet and that I have a long road ahead of me but I'm so determined to do this.  I never EVER want to go back to feeling that way.  I've felt physically ill at times over these past 4 days because of lack of alcohol and I still am not going to pick up a drink.  I want to be alive to see my niece and nephew grow up and I want the person who cares for my parents if they need it as they get older.  I want to give my dog the best life she can possibly have because she kind of helped save mine...You guys if I can do this I promise anyone can.  Thanks for reading and again for being such an inspiration to someone who was silently struggling and finally found the strength to say "I deserve better."
