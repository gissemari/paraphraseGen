I relapsed last night.    woke up this morning feeling awful tired washed out anxious and ashamed. I didn't do anything stupid I was at home but I was doing well up to that point. Still I learnt a couple of things - I still can't moderate no matter what that lying bastard voice tells me and alcohol definitely does not help with anxiety - it creates more than it cures (if a short term haze where you forget about it can be called a cure). Back to day one again for me.

When it clicked in my head that moderation was not an option for me (after two tries of course) becoming sober was much easier.   Night and day difference.  It's liberating actually.  
I keep telling myself that I can go back and I'll be fine. The voice is really strong lately. 
Well done for making it back so quickly!..Understanding and accepting that moderation isn't an option for me has been the key to me staying sober...Saying no to the first one is far easier than saying no to the 2nd...
I like that thought - you're right it's easier to say no when you're sober than after. 
amen with the anxiety. it's such a vicious cycle
