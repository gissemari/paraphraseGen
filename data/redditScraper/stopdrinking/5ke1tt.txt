After 15 years of non stop binge drinking I'm proud to say that this is my third sober Christmas. To those who are thinking about stopping or have recently stopped drinking stick with it it does get considerably easier. ..In the last two and a half years I've managed to start the gym gained 20lbs. lean body mass and dropped a considerable amount of body fat my complexion and posture are both better and people actually have noticed. ..I also left a job that enabled me to drink and started in at University this past fall. After the first semester I'm rocking a 4.2 GPA and am on my way to becoming a Registered Dietitian. SD helped me realize I was headed down a destructive path and pushed me over the edge to make these life changes. .To anyone who is struggling don't lose hope. It does get easier and it could lead you to reach your full potential. ..Merry Christmas SD and Happy 2017!
