I've put together 9 days. I feel great. 10 days ago I was scared sick hungover. My mind would rattle in my head like a chainsaw all the time. I would wake up and my firs thought would be alcohol- how much did I drink last night how impaired I would be at work whether I could make it through the day at work...My mind is at rest and I am sleeping again. Some days I'm not even thinking about drinking. I had 900 days sober before I tried this experiment that was a total failure...Getting back into AA reading and talking to people have gotten me back on track. I also read a really good chapter about AA and alcoholism in Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace. He really sums up the desperation of alcoholism and AA warts and all. ..Anyway it's Friday night and I am very happy to be sober right now!

I'm happy that you're sober too. Welcome back!
Glad you made it back! Weekends were hard for me so I often went to lots of AA meetings. It was comforting to be with people who understood and it helped with lonelieness. Happy sober weekend!
You had 900 days sober before? What caused you to want to relapse? What was your thought process like?..What are you doing differently this time? ..
Welcome back. :)
Hey sixtaps  You and I have the same number of days but I haven't asked for a badge because I don't want to jinx myself ... have relapsed too many times to count.  Isn't it lovely to have days when the thoughts of alcohol aren't there!..Stay strong :)
