I went to my first AA meeting that was labeled as a young peoples meeting but I was by far the youngest person there by at least 15 years. No one else was under 40. Is this common? I felt really out of place...I tried going to another one that was listed on the SEPIA website and no one showed up. Maybe the list was out of date?..Maybe not even an AA meeting but something. I need to know I'm not alone in this. There has to be other people in my age group who are struggling like I am.

I would say look for the similarities rather then the differences. A lot can be learned from many by many...Now for the age factor. When I was in rehab and AA/NA I was usually the oldest. Most people were between 20 and 30 some old geezers like myself. I also found that meetings could be drastically different from one another depending when and where I went. Keep looking something will pop up. Good luck!
I haven't been to AA but have you tried checking your meet up for a sober friends or activities?

I'm in my late 20s and in the same boat. I'm also a blackout drinker. Have you tried finding a meeting on a different night where there may be different people? Young people in AA do exist but it took me time to find meetings that had some. 
There are definitely young people in AA. I'm in my 20s. It took some time for me to find meetings that I liked with young AA people but I did find them and have made a lot of amazing friends both young and old. Shop around. Try meetings with different formats. If you do meet some younger people ask them what meetings they like to go to. Don't give up.
