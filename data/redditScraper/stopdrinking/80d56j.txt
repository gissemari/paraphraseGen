HANGED MAN (upright)..The Hanged Man shows a man suspended upside-down from the living World Tree rooted in the underworld and supporting the heavens. Given the serene expression on his face it is believed he is hanging on the tree of his own will. His right foot is bound to the tree but his left foot remains free bent at the knee and tucked in behind his right leg. His arms are bent with hands held behind his back forming an inverted triangle. The man is wearing red pants representing human passion and the physical body a blue coat for knowledge and yellow shoes representing his high ideals. Around the Hanged Man's head is a bright yellow halo showing spiritual attainment with the grey background suggesting invisibility (a good reminder to not flaunt your spirituality). This is the card of ultimate surrender of being suspended in time and of martyrdom and sacrifice to the greater good. This is the archetype to meditate on to help break old patterns of behaviour and bad habits that restrict you...Upright the Hanged Man reflects a need to suspend action and as a result a period of indecision may be indicated. Decisions or actions that need to be implemented will be postponed even if at the time there is a sense of urgency to act. In fact you may be much better off if you can stall on any decision-making and action-taking at this time in order to provide yourself with more time to reflect on the situation at hand and to consider the greater good. If you can buy yourself some more time or hold off on any further activities for a short period then you may actually create a different and better outcome. This is a card that is all about suspension and waiting and suggests that this may be just what you need to do in order to allow new possibilities to arise. Sometimes not acting will help to shed more light on what other options are available to you and will allow more attractive opportunities to emerge...The Hanged Man can sometimes reflect that you are feeling stuck or restricted in your life. You need to get in touch with why you are feeling this way and work to release yourself from these restrictions. In this way the Hanged Man is also about letting go. You need an emotional release from whatever it is that is leaving you feeling stuck. Accept and surrender to your present circumstances. You may need to become more vulnerable and open to different experiences but this will help you end the struggle and give up your need for control. It is when you can really let go of all the worries and concerns that you have that you find these concerns suddenly disappear and a new reality is possible.
