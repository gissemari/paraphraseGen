I've been battling for my mental health for the past seven or eight years and for my sobriety since 2009. My life story is pretty unremarkable and has already been discussed *ad nauseam* so I won't go into that unless it becomes relevant. ..I relapsed just over four months ago after being sober for 15 months. I've used three times since but I feel myself getting worse tearing down all the defenses I had built. I've been in and out of an existential crisis and although I'm not exactly suicidal I do wonder sometimes whether I'll have killed myself 10 or 20 years into the future; I'm getting tired of this pathetic dance...Even so I'm not defeated yet. I've gone from being bedridden for weeks due to depression and drug abuse to being just a neurotic drug user to being a somewhat rational drug user to being a stable sober individual. Overall things are getting better even though I've stumbled along the way. I may feel like shit at the moment but this too shall pass. In fact I feel better already...I've created this throwaway account so I could speak freely and get more involved with the community so I guess you'll be seeing more of me in the near future. ..

Catharsis is a powerful tool in recovery. From very early we are taught good thoughts/bad thoughts. If I keep having shitty thoughts does this mean I am a shitty person? Just get it all out there ask for help learn from the interpretation of others what can work for you. It's very reciprocal here life in general is but when it tightens to a narrow scope it's really remarkable what we can do for each other here. I know I learn a whole lot more than I give here but I also know with more time used correctly yields more wisdom to help others. ..Welcome to SD let us know how we can help you best!
