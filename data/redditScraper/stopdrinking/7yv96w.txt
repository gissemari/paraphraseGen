I  am still sort of happy that I didn't have a drink for the weekend at-least. I drank a lot of beer yesterday as I met a friend downtown. ..Even though I relapsed I think not drinking from fri-sunday was a tiny step forward. ..Resetting and starting from 1 again :)

It certainly was a step forward! Sometimes unfortunately we still have some "field research" to do. (For me I landed myself in a lot of trouble. Don't be like me!) And it's great that you didn't allow this to turn into a binge of sorts. Welcome back! IWNDWYT!
Hey there. I'm in the same boat so let's go back to day 1 together and knock this nonsense on the head!  Well done for coming straight back here     
It sure was now let's get back at it!
I had to lose more than I was willing to lose before I could quit.
