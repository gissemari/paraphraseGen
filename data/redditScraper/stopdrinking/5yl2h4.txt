I did it! Now on to the next 40. ..Big things so far:..**Crazy night time legs haven't gone** - kindling withdrawal or whatever my legs and whole body still need shaking out at night. ..**Tea and sparkling water** - Gone from strong espresso coffee in the day and Malbec at night to Earl grey and S Pellegrino all day long. Wow. Just wow. ..**I'm getting seriously interested in things again** - You know when a guy from the past is asleep for 50 years in a movie then wakes up and spends that night in front of the TV watching all the stuff he's missed? Feels like that. ..**Out walking every day up at 7am every morning** - Laziness isn't really an issue. I just get up and go out as it's seems like the thing to do just like eating going to the toilet or sleeping. Exercise comes naturally. ..**I still struggle with habitual cravings at 7pm** - Every night without fail my stupid brain thinks it's drink time. Dumbass. ..**SD is awesome** - I come here every day without fail. Without you guys I don't think I could do this. ..**Lost loads of weight** - Bonus!!!

Yay!!!
Awesome congrats on 40 days!
Congrats!  I love SD as well.  When religiously being in here and reading I get the same feelings I get when I go-to an AA meeting.  Just being with people dealing with the same issue and hearing all their stories experiences and tips.  It really helps.  Also being able to get support when having a bad day or encouragement when making milestones or having a great day...Keep up the good work.  Another 40 isn't that far off!
Still hanging in there with you big guy.  40 days and 40 nights in the books!
Get in there mate!!!! Good stuff. 
Congrats.  These detailed glimpses of a possible future for me are like light at the end of a tunnel.  Keep up the great work...I will not drink with you today.
For me it's driving home from work that I really have to look out for or finishing up when I'm working from home. Late afternoons and evenings. What scares me though is that after each stint of breakfast and day drinking I feel new pathways forming there like vines. Tendrils shooting out like some sort of insidious *thing* that can never be satiated. I never quite realised how progressive this dependence is.
congrats on the 40 days! You've got this. Now on to the next 40?1 Won't be drinking with you today!
The first 40 days were the hardest for me.  It keeps getting easier!   A Big Congratulations to you!!
Congratulations!!
