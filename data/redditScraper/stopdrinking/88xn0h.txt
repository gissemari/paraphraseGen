I relapsed last night. I hate myself again. I hate everything. What the fuck is wrong with me. Can't stand this feeling again. I've decided I can't do this alone anymore. I need to get professional help. Going to my first AA on Wednesday.

Beating yourself up won't help...What's done is done you have one more thing you can learn from that's it...Download Russell Brands audio book google the meetings and do what you need to do Wednesday. ..Hating yourself isn't going to make that process any easier. Let it go.
Feeling the same way myself..I drank on Easter and so mad at myself too and feel embarrassed. We can do this. Feel proud of yourself that you are going to AA that is a step in the right direction.
AA has been a savior for me. AA has its quirks and people tend get a little dogmatic about the steps and the Big Book. But I think it's a solid program. I owe my life and marriage to AA. I wish you the best. Keep us posted.
