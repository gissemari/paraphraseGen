Hey there. Im the sobernaut formerly known as u/imfuckingdonewithit ..In an effort to focus more on the positive aspects of my sobriety I'm revamping if you will. My username is an homage to my passion my motorcycle [Black Betty](https://imgur.com/a/YHiNH08) My self reward for the progress I've made against my alcoholism.  Now that I spend less time making excuses to drink recovering from previous drinking or routing my day around stopping at the liquor store I can devote more time to this little lady. And a shout out to my wife. It's been a rocky road but we will ride into that sunset! ..This is also to test my flair. I don't remember my stop drinking day for sure but I know I'm at 1000!
