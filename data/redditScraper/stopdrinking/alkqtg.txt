Here again. Will flip my badge to day 1 tomorrow. Whatever it shows now isn't close to the truth. ..This wasn't a recent relapse just me ignoring the situation again. I called 6 different therapists trying to get in to see someone. I can't do this alone but I don't know about going to meetings. I may try one tomorrow but I feel like one on one will be more productive for now. ..I am not sure what to say. My life isn't terrible. I don't think I am depressed. I am anxious as hell but that could be the booze and the inevitable bullshiting I do so no one knows my secret. ..I am going to lose my marriage if I don't stop. I am going to lose my job if I don't stop. I am going to die from this shit if I don't stop. ..Screw everything about this. I never wanted to be here. I wish I could be like other people. I used to be but somewhere along the way I lost control. ..Thanks for listening.

Welcome back friend. Those things you describe your marriage and your job I know so well what it's like to feel like that stuff is slipping away because of alcohol. I know what it's like to wake up feeling like a dried out awful husk of who I once was and who I could be. .  I'm beating it back one day at a time. You can do this too. We can beat this thing and take our lives back and protect what's ours. Keep at it!
It sounds like you have a lot going for you and you're ready to do something before it's too late. Good for you! You can remove this one obstacle from your life and get back on track. Best of luck to you! IWNDWYTD
A huge percentage of people here state that their anxiety reduces or disappears once they stop drinking - good luck ! 
I could have wrote this.  Same situation.  IWNDWYT
