After a four day bender I am back to day 1. For those of you contemplating a relapse let me tell you that it is absolutely not worth it. I seem to make it a week eat better feel better then decide I can handle it. ..After feeling some discomfort in the right side. I knew it was time to see a doctor. Hopefully I haven't done any permanent damage to myself. He checked and everything seemed fine. Now just waiting on blood tests. It felt really good to open up to a doctor about my drinking. If you're contemplating it I highly recommend it.

Welcome back! Good luck on day 1. IWNDWYT 
Good on you for going to your doc and being honest. That's a great first step. I recommend the book This Naked Mind. I had a few false starts on sobriety before I read it and it's really helped this time around. That book and come here every day keeps me sober. You got this! IWNDWYT!
