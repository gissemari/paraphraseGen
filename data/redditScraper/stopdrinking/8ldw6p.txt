I got sober 2 years and nearly 4 months ago. At that time I was completely at rock bottom. I'd lost my job lost my home lost a relationship and was mountains in debt. Since getting sober I moved away got a new job started a new relationship and finances are much better. It hasn't been easy but it has been so much better than the years I lost before this...Two weeks ago I took custody of a 5 year old whose mom is struggling with her own sobriety and isn't able to provide a safe environment. I am amazed by how much my life has changed. It is not because I am not drinking per session but putting the alcohol has allowed me to MOVE FORWARD with life instead of staying stagnant. ..It doesn't take 2.5 years to notice positive changes I'm here to tell you that putting the alcohol down can have positive effects soon after. I found a job in two months getting sober when I had previously been looking for a year. Like I said it allows you to be more motivated and move forward...So all you out there thinking about putting that drink down I say do it.  Start a new chapter in your life and see where it takes you. For most of us who have been there we understand that there isn't much to lose.

Thank you! I do not want to stay stagnant. Alcohol makes me complacent with not moving forward. For too long I've confused it with comfort.
