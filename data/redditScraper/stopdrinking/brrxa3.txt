I am struggling right now on my first day off sober (or at least not extremely hungover ) I cleaned up the house and am about to put in laundry ... this is the point where id usually give myself a pat on the back and go to get a beer . Im feeling really anxious .. quite the fish out of well booze . I need to mindful in that yes im feeling anxious  its a feeling not an order . It too will pass . I think Ill do something I havent done in a very long time : go to the library . I used to love going every weekend and checking out new graphic novels or books ive been interested in and at our local library even dvds cds etc . Libraries are great because theyre one of the only places in american society where you dont have expectation of buying anything . IWNDWYT .

I love the library :) it's one of my favorite places in the world. Nothing better then grabbing a coffee and reading a book no pressures no worries. Enjoy!
Yes! I love the library! What kind of books do you like to read? What graphic novels do you recommend? There are a lot of readers here...I also like watching engrossing movies/tv series when I feel that antsy-ness. ..IWNDWYT
Ahhh.. libraries
