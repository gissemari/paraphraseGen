Well hello redditors..I already posted once here about sobering up. I managed to be sober for 10 days then relapsed and was too ashamed to tell you guys. Sorry about that...Last night I decided not to drink. It went almost right the cravings were there for almost all the evening until I went to bed. It wasn't really my decision altough. My girlfriend asked me not to drink.  She drinks also but not as much as me...I've been a heavy drinker since I was 19 now I'm 32 and have a 2 years old girl...&amp;#x200B;..Let me explain some more about my situation. Why it is so hard for me beside the addiction I live in a not so satisfaying environment...\- I've been depressed for 6 years I see a psychiatrist once a month since 2017. We tried at least 4 different medication. None of them seems to work...\- My relationship with my girlfriend is pretty shitty. She cheated on me at least twice. Last time was in september. She went to wedding without me. I stayed in Paris with our daughter. At 5AM I was woken up by her iPad ringing again and again. When I went to turn it off I saw that she was sending messages to her former FWB inviting him to her hotel room. He didn't come but still I know what happend during the evening. I should and I wanted to leave her cheating ass immediatly but guess what? We contracted a goddamn 25 years mortage one month before.  Boom stuck.....\- I also saw her deleting messages right in front of me. When I asked why she told me it was another former FWB. She told me that it was just random messages. I didn't have problem with her seeing him again as friends. But well... ..She's in total denial when I confront her and I can't trust her anymore. It makes me feel so much pain almost everyday. I tell her I love her when she asks but deeply inside I know I don't. ..More recently she had some pretty disturbing discussions with another new "friend" of ours. ..I feel like I'm completely paranoid my shrink says it's normal...\- I don't have anymore friends since all we do when I see them is binge drinking and talking about what we did when we were in high school. The last friend I had I lost him because he told us (my gf and I) a secret and asked us not to tell anyone. Guess what she did. SHE FUCKING DID as soon as he left our condo. Next day my friend called me crying telling me that it ruined a part of his life...\- My job seems so useless to me I'm an application developer but the thing I'm working doesn't make sense it will never help people...\- I don't have any more hobbies. I used to do sports music games sciences electronics. Now everything makes me bored...&amp;#x200B;..I don't think about suicide anymore well not as often as I used to...&amp;#x200B;..I know that tonight I will stop at the liquor store again buy my 2 liters of strong beer feel shitty about it and cry while taking the first sip. I hate myself so much about this. I just can't I'm tired and I need to vent. I can't take it anymore.

It sounds like there are lots of things about your life that you want to change. For me tackling the big things became easier once I stopped drinking. It took a while though. I spent about two years trying different things like counting drinks only drinking on certain days seeing a psychologist telling my doctor telling my family and reading books about alcohol but whenever I'd get a few sober days up I'd just hit it even harder when I drank again. Eventually what worked for me (or rather what has been working so far) was AA. Other people on the sub have their own things that worked for them too. I hope you find yours.
All of the things I needed to get going on like yes dumping my cheating lying ex could only be done once I started getting sober...I don't mean completely sober because I've relapsed many times but once I STARTED not drinking all of the other stuff could be done.  It seemed needed to be done and all of the other things were much easier...Listen my friend don't think that this is a linear thing; you quit drinking completely and all of the other stuff falls into place...No you have to start working on ALL of it but a major component is to stop drinking and by "stop drinking" I mean exactly what you are doing now.  You're doing your first 24 hours and then you say you are going to buy beer and drink.  BUT YOU MADE IT 24 HOURS!  If you drink again that 24 hours is NOT taken from you.  You will then try again maybe make it three days then drink for a week and then make it another 3 days.....You are stopping drinking.  And then the other stuff can be and will be worked on as well...Loves to you.
