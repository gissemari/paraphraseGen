How do y'all deal with relapses? Specifically when you feel like you have conquered it and the bottle comes back to show you how weak you really are. I had been feeling like I had a handle on my cravings and then I find myself drinking like I swore I wouldn't and driving to Taco Bell. I need help.

The best way to feel better is to get right back on the wagon. Ask yourself what happened and how you can deal with it better next time!  You just skipped one day...Don't feel bad about the Taco Bell btw. It happens
Hi I don't think you are weak alcohol is a highly addictive substance and as we all know would have been banned outright if it was introduced today. Have you read This Naked Mind by Annie Grace? I can really recommend it. She addresses the notion that we are weak and powerless over alcohol (controversially in the sense that AA believe this) and instead tackles how you/we see alcohol. It's a very low-pressure book (you can even read it while drinking!) but it completely changed my attitude towards drinking and I know lots of other people on here rate it highly...The other thing I read on here once that really resonated with me is that it's about control. We all know that we lose control once we start drinking but we have the control to not have that first one. That makes me feel powerful! ..IWNDWYT.
