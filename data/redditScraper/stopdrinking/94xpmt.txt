Longest ive been sober since February this year where i was coming up to 3 years sober but had an unfortunate relapse. That relapsed was then a week on and week off of drinking then feeling like crap then drinking again...Something happened 4 weeks ago where I was just sick and tired of being sick and tired again ...Since then I'veanahed to get my marks in school back up again  reconnected with friends and family gotten my sleep on a better cycle and exercised more...Most importantly I'm starting to feel spiritually well again. My short terms goals are to study a bit more go to more AA meetings and excercise more...I've noticed an increase in binge eating which I do when sober at times. I'm a tall guy and skinny but have put on about 10 lbs since quitting drinking and I am hopefully going to start managing the binging better . ..I got to take my niece and nephew to see Taylor Swift last night in Toronto and I am so grateful I got to be sober and present for them :)..Ranting over happy 24 y'all. I can't believe how different I feel today vs 4 week ago so for anyone new or struggling keep at it you're worth it.

Congrats!
Well done. Sometimes I feel like I'm playing whack-a-mole with my addiction. I put down the bottle and picked up the fork. I've been told that the 12 steps will really help with that though. Plus cake won't kill me nearly as fast as drinking and it's totally fine to chocolate and drive. One step at a time ;)
Congratulations!
