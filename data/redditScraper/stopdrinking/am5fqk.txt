Some personal shit went down. It's been little things adding up over about 6 months. It's a pile. I feel betrayed. It's hella inflaming my abandonment issues and I just don't know if I care anymore. ..I'm sorry to be vague. But if nothing matters why the fuck should I care so much? I don't think I'll drink but fucking hell I want to.
