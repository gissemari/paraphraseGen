Warning long post...I've been struggling with drinking since my husband said he wanted a divorce. A bit of background; I am 21 and we've been together for almost four years. We have a three year old who I love with all my heart. She is currently living with me back in my home state while he is in the military. ..Ever since August when we got into a fight and I flew back to my home state I've been seriously depressed. When I didn't know what was happening when I flew back to where we lived to give my daughter stability until we figured out everything etc. I found it easier to talk to my ex when I was drinking. It was like I could say whatever I wanted- no anxiety just free words. Between still being intimate and  playing house  drinking was what we did. And I just found it easier to get through living with him with that. ..When I moved back after my daughters birthday I still continued to drink a lot. After she'd go to bed I'd sit down and get drunk. When she was away with family I'd get fucked up that night. And every morning I'd wake up feeling depressed missing my marriage and the life I had. I've stopped taking my antidepressants because I drink every night almost. ..She might move back with her father. He might fight me now on keeping her. If she goes back I'd need the time to get myself healthy stop drinking get help for my depression and anxiety. But I don't want to lose her. I feel like it would be more stable since my father is an alcoholic as well and we live with him. I'm scared if I give my ex residential custody I'm failing as a mother. And I'll never get her back. ..Last night was probably the nail in the coffin for me. I know I should slow down but at the same time- I don't want to. It's my way of calming down. Being able to sleep. Being comfortable talking about hard things. I'm sitting here hungover missing my ex husband realizing I posted embarrassing videos on social media by accident and just hating myself. I don't know if I have a problem. I don't know if I need to go to meetings. I don't even know if I'll even be able to cut back. But I'm not drinking tonight. I feel lost and sad. ...Sorry for all the rambling just needed an outlet. Thank you.

Thank you so much for sharing this. It moved me a lot...I'm currently 28 and I've had depression and anxiety since I was 12. I understand how difficult it is- the hopelessness helplessness and need for comfort and escape. On top of your depression/anxiety you are dealing with an incredible difficult and painful situation. I wish I could give you a hug. ..I used alcohol and drugs to self-medicate for years and years. Sometimes it worked. Sometimes it didn't. Towards the end it wasn't working at all for me. I was miserable. I desperately wanted to get out of the cycle of mental illness and substance use but I didn't know how. I also didn't want to get into sobriety or recovery because committing to something like that for the rest of my life sounded insane. ..I reached the breaking point when I was wishing that I'd fall asleep and never wake up. It was here that I realized I couldn't fight this thing alone and that I needed help. It sounds like you are reaching out for some help with this post...I'm not going to tell you that you're an alcoholic and need to go to meetings. You'll figure that out. All I can stay is that I was never able to find any true relief from my depression and anxiety until I stopped drinking. And I couldn't stop drinking until I got help. For me it was outpatient treatment therapy medication and AA. I really hope that you get the help you need because you are a beautiful person. 
Hi. You are here. Maybe that means you might already..know there is an issue...Alcoholism is progressive. If you hate the depression and.. hangovers anxiety restlessness fears... then yeah you ..don't ever have to have them again...I'm not saying life will be an easy ride - but a LOT of..the drama will go away right away...Drinking makes any bad day or any scary. .situation much worse than it needs to be. ..For me I had to stop alcohol and get on my ..SSRI's in order to feel better and cope. ..I felt 100 times better in 2 weeks...What I mean by that is that *everything*..was easier to deal with...I was sure I would get hangover-free and feel..better physically but I got a bonus: Emotionally..spiritually financially friendships/relationship-wise..decision making clarity organizationally ..work/school/family - I mean everything got better...Some things got a little better some things..got a LOT better - and look - it's only been 32..days for me!! What the heck!..Try it you'll like it. :) :) ..And if you change your mind you can take back ..the depression and hangovers. Right? ..Not kidding - the alcohol anxiety will give way to ..a bit of regular anxiety (fears) but that is easier..to handle. ..It helped me a great deal to come on here and also go to AA. ..Lots of stuff is available - find what works for you and get on..the road to happy destiny. :)...
