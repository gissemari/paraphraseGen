I want all the alcohol and all the drugs in the world..this is probably the worst craving I've had since the first month of sobriety. Sweeeeet..

It happens. IWNDWYT however. 
Any particular reason?
Me too but my badge is way less impressive than yours. So I'm talking myself in to it because I  have nothing to lose . Fuck
Can you pinpoint why?
IWNDWYT Stay strong it will pass
You know you would regret even more. IWNDWYT
Thanks for your comments everyone! I am not going to use but I definitely have to figure out what made me feel this way today. I took an antabuse to be sure I won't drink. 
Me too. And I have right around the same number of days as you. Maybe it's the year mark. Argh. Well I won't drink with you today...
You mean you don't feel like this everyday? Fuk when will this end. I made it through I will not drink with you today and hopefully not tomorrow either.
