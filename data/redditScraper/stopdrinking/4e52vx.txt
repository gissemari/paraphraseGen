Time to reset the ol' badge. Last time I lasted much longer (2+ months) but after relapsing it was game over. How do y'all get back on the wagon?
----------immediate responses--------

I was a chronic relapser for a long time until I finally wasn't. After relapsing I had to start by not drinking that day - making a decision to not drink in the morning and not worrying about what happens tomorrow...I personally got a lot of support from AA meetings and made them a priority but I understand it's not everyone's thing.
The being an alcoholic thing... my suggestion is not to get bogged down by the words / definitions.  This was my progression.. .. * You are here.    . * Alcohol is a problem. . * Doing it alone isn't working.. * AA (or smart or whatever) has been the thing that got a lot of folks over the hump. and then set them down a different better path.      . * What have you got to lose?  Ps agnostic in AA here - no problems.
For me it was about two months of "I'll quit tomorrow". After a month of tomorrows I decided to focus on my daily routine -- add exercise track food go to bed at a decent hour visit r/SD daily etc. Finally had a 3 day weekend where I thought I could successfully avoid leaving the house and decided "today" was finally "tomorrow". I spent a good portion of the weekend here along with TV and video games. Day 3 is my worst day so I spent the majority of that day here. Each day since I spend time here and *do not * pick up that first drink. Oh I also didn't talk about with my SO until I had eight days because I've 'stopped' too often to have confidence that 4 days for example was a sign this try would stick. ..TL;DR one day was "today I will not drink" wash rinse repeat and now I'm &gt; 2 weeks 
It's tough because it always seems like something to do tomorrow. But you just have to not pick up today and the days start building back up. And there's always a lesson to be learned from a relapse so I tend to do some navel gazing to work out where I went wrong and what I could do different...You can do it!
I've been to afraid to get off the wagon.  However I think u/coolcrosby Baby Steps would be a great place to start!..Welcome back.  The good news is you're here.  Congratulations!
If you're relapsing all of the time then you have a problem that needs addressed today and that's the only day you have to worry about...Too easy to overthink things. I could never string more than 2 weeks together as I'd always get drawn into internal debates about the viability of long term sobriety. Doesn't matter. Not drinking today is the only thing that matters.
