Things have been going okay lately. Most of my friends now know that I'm not drinking which a month ago was one of the things of was most nervous about. None of them seems to care in a good way. Obviously they care about me. I just mean I was working myself up thinking they see me as some weirdo but they all are just cool with it or whatever. Does that make sense?..My family doesn't know yet but I'm sure my dad has noticed since we see each other fairly often. I'll get around to telling the 'rents eventually I guess. Hanging out with some cousins later this week and I'm going to have to tell them since they all want to go out to bars in the city. ..In general things are actually not too bad. I rarely have cravings when I get home from work anymore which was obviously a huge struggle only 3 months ago. I can hang out with friends at bars and restaurants and feel okay about just drinking water. From time to time I'm still having thoughts about whether or not this whole sober thing is going to be forever. But I'm trying to remind myself of all of the terrible things that happened while I was drinking. I even started writing a song about it...Still feeling on edge a lot. Getting anxious and depressed often and I know I should seek professional help like my partner wants. I'm not really sure what's holding me back. ..I'm smoking a lot more cigarettes now than I was when I was drinking but I'm telling myself one addiction at a time. Hoping to tackle that one soon though...Sorry for the novel it's just been a while since I've posted and I'd like to sort of use this as a journal...Thanks for all of the support. Love you guys.

Keep it up buddy! I'm smoking to relax too v_v but at least I don't turn into a monster after one. One issue at a time :)
