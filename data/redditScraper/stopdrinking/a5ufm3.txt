Based on this [graph](https://imgur.com/a/RpzaOPq) of my net worth over the last two years can you figure out when I finally quit drinking? Happy to give hints if anyone is stumped...In all seriousness though things are so much better for me now than a year ago financially mentally and emotionally. It took me a lot of tries to get this far but it is worth it. If you are struggling out there with this holiday season don't give up. I will not drink with you today.
