I've had two pretty bad relapses since mid October that have each gotten me to (re)commit to stopping drinking. The more recent one lasted continuously from thanksgiving through Wednesday night this week. It's Friday mid morning and I'm sitting at my desk at work and my brain is still scrambled. I'm sweating and my hands are shaky. This is the worst withdrawal I've ever dealt with. Anyone else notice it gets worse after each relapse? This is really terrifying me in to never touching the stuff again.

I think that they call the worsening withdrawals 'the kindling effect'. I had sweats for the first week it was grim. Wishing you the best. 
I believe it is the kindling affect. With every relapse withdrawals do get worse. Be Well. Alcohol withdrawal can be dangerous. 
Oh yeah I sweat for at least 4 days and my brain felt fried for two weeks.
