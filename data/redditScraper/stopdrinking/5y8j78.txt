I had three months. Relapsed almost every week since December. Yesterday was my day one again...asking for a little support today thanks.

You made it back &amp; you're in good company :)
You just gotta keep trying until it sticks. Failure isn't an option just temporary set-backs. What has worked for you in the past to keep from drinking? 
So glad you're back! This is the thing we do when we relapse. I make sure I understand the cause and have a plan to avoid whatever caused this in the first place. Relapse and continue to learn. Build on your foundation of sobriety. Keep on posting! :)
I will not drink with you today. SD is here for us.
I'm starting over with you. We can do it we have to.
Me too. I have to find my way back. We can do this - I won't drink with you today   
Welcome back I wish you all the best. I've also been relapsing practically every week since December. Day 2 for me. I won't be drinking today!
Day 1 for me again too. Glad you're back
