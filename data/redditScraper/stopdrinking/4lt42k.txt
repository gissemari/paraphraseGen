I got a call  to drive 15 miles out of town to pick up my brother. I noticed I was running low on gas and thought this would be a great time to stop in at the gas station and get a beer like I usually did. But instead this time I actually played it forward I realized that I run the risk of a second DUI the risk of losing my marriage by coming home with beer on my breath as well as all the risk associated with driving under the influence. I had just been reading SD less than an hour before the phone call and seeing the success stories and how others have copped I believe is what helped me move past this test. So thank you to SD and for those of you strugglingjust say the phrase Play it Forward over and over again and the urge will pass and your mind will be more occupied then with that urge to drink God bless you all and have a good evening...
