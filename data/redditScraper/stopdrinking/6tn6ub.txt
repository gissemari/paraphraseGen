Hello all..I'm still pretty new here. I know a common problem and one that I certainly struggle with is romanticizing drinking. There are all kinds of famous people who are well known not just only because of whatever they accomplished in life but also because they accomplished all of these things while drinking (apparently) constantly. See for example Hemingway or Sinatra or Churchill...We don't talk so much about famous teetotalers even though they may represent an even more significant break from the norm. I think for my part at least that having some teetotalers to look up to would be a serious help. When I did some digging I was surprised at some of the people I found. Naturally these people will reflect my areas of interest -- if this would be a helpful exercise to you please post about the kinds of people you look up to! If you have the time it might be interesting to find some of the things they've said about alcohol as well. I'll start:..* **Richard Feynman:** Feynman (a physicist and all-around interesting personality) is well known for his experimentation with different drugs and for part of his life for his drinking. However he started to recognize signs of alcoholism in himself. He decided that he valued his brain -- and by extension his ability to carry on as a serious physicist -- more than alcohol and he stopped completely. He said: "You see I get such fun out of *thinking* that I don't want to destroy this most pleasant machine that makes life such a big kick. It's the same reason that later on I was reluctant to try experiments with LSD in spite of my curiosity about hallucinations.".* **Arthur C. Clarke:** Clarke of *2001: A Space Odyssey* fame was also a teetotaler. In a reflection on his life Michael Moorcock wrote: "Self-absorbed he might be and a teetotaler but an impeccable gent through and through." -- this really exemplifies the rather perverse stance a lot society seems to take on drinking. "Well he didn't drink but he was an OK guy anyway." I feel that we wouldn't hear this sort of thing if he had been a heavy drinker as so many writers seem to be.

I don't know what he's like in real life as I haven't listened to his podcasts or watched his stand up shows but I really like Marc Maron playing himself in the Netflix series 'Maron'. I found him pretty inspirational. I presume he's somewhat similar irl.
Robert Downey Jr. Eric Clapton Anthony Hopkins...all in recovery/teetotal. Clapton in particular; weathered the death of his son without picking up. True heroes.
David Bowie!!!!..[Some thoughts from him on his sobriety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_VU9xITCE).
Steven King! 
Angus Young ---&gt; AC/DC. You don't need to be pissed to rip it up. 
Samuel L Jackson
Another great one -- Joe Biden! And a couple more writers: Kafka and Borges.
John Larroquette. (Some of his AA speeches audio only of course are on YouTube.)..Pete Townshend...Ringo Starr.
I really like Craig Ferguson. He doesn't say much about his sobriety but when he does it's deep and also hilarious. 
I went to a bachelor party with a couple of my bar patrons who have also become good friends of mine. There were about ten of us standing around a table full of booze bottles and some of the guys had begun doing shots in honor of the groom. I only knew 3 or 4 of the guys. One drunk dude in particular was hassling me about not wanting a shot. Now anyone who has quit drinking knows there are those friends who feel they need to tell everyone that you don't drink and want to 'defend' you from the pressure. I'm used to the pressure because I am constantly being asked to do shots when I'm working behind the bar so I really was just letting it go. But my two buddies are like "No man he doesn't drink" which obviously upsets the drunk guy. Drunk guy starts bitching about it and drunkenly says "What do you mean he doesn't drink? Name one person you admire who doesn't drink." And one of my friends points at me and goes "That guy." It pretty much ended the conversation and really reinforced my belief that I'm on the right path. 
Strangely enough the drag queen Katya. Oftentimes I'll think about how I want to model a lot of the traits that I see in her that clearly come from holding sobriety. 
Henry Rollins 
Nick Cave Dave Gahan Rob Delaney Jamie Lee Curtis Ewan McGregor
Keith Buckley frontman of Every Time I Die...He was known for being completely shitfaced and writing about the same...Little excerpt from his [Forbes interview](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebaltin/2016/10/09/every-time-i-die-prove-perseverance-pay-off/#2b2f73a312e8):  "You gotta walk again alcohol is a crutch and if you put it away you're weak at first a little Bambi on ice. But yeah I got it."
Robert Downey Jr. Is a living example that you can come back from anything. He is the comeback kid.
I always think of the famous mathematician Paul Erd s who said alcohol was "poison". He was one of the most prolific mathematicians of the 20th century and I doubt he could have accomplished a tenth of what he did with a constant hangover!
Basically all of these folks..http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/4115017.
I have this page bookmarked ..https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_teetotalers..Personally it's Lana Del Rey - her first album is a long love song to alcohol and how she misses it.
