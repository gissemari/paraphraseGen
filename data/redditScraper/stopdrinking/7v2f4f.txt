I totally agree with you.  I never want to be standing on the edge of the abyss again.  Those were dark times.  I quit drinking in the past for long stretches only to relapse.  I've learned there is big difference between quitting drinking and learning to live sober.  It's a work in progress but so far the results have been great.
Hey man thanks for the post! I will not drink with you today!
