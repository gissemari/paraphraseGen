So the sun started doing its thing today again for the first time this year. Being sober these coming months hold a lot of promises and good intentions/ possibilities. The last time the weather was this good my relationship started falling apart my drinking was getting the best of me and financially i was in a rut not really going anywhere. I was "content" with where i was while cracking open a cold one and being disappointed in my gf and afraid of the future...This time i'm sober..i'll be sober in spring i'll be sober in summer and way beyond that. Yes my heart is broken and financially i'm really not there yet. Still afraid of the future BUT summer and sunshine always held a sense of a "this is gonna be great" feeling..Only to wake up every single day during summer with a hangover and just not enjoying it at all.. Everything feels so different now. i am capable i am achieving things. I know whats coming aswell. I'm expecting some awesome days and stories but also some really deep downers and moodswings.. I made some new friends and learned a lot. Still learning a bunch tho i'm only at 210 days or something. Not at all where i want to be in life but some days ypu know it just seems possible to get there. And thats friggin' awesome. You know when you see a little kid playing in the streets and ypou think "that little fucker holds so much potential and has his whole life ahead of him". Well some days i can look at myself like that and thats crazy. I was ok with dying a while back. Unsatisfied with life and with myself. But now? Now i'm taking control better yet i'm finally able to take control and build a life. ..I'm a teacher so i have a weeks worth of holiday coming up. i used to rejoice in the idea of having a full week to drink without being afraid of responsibilities. THIS time around i'm getting a "vacation job" to get some extra cash. Not for booze but just to save or invest in something. Just because you know this is my life and lets just make the fucking best of it every day. Looking and even imagining a future is weird and scary sometimes but its also exciting and i'm really into it lately...And its thanks to this community that i know whats coming. Reading all of your posts and advice and lessons learned and pitfalls to watch out for and just wisdom in general. Its like you guys gave me a map. I know where its safe to travel and i know where i need to watch my back. I avoided some relapses learning about HALT and PAWS and i could see that the harder routes to travel really hold the most promises to a beautiful vista. I'm keeping this map and hopefully i can add to it for some of you. Just as you guys did for me and others...Thanks guys and gals. This sub is really amazing. Sober on you friggin' weirdos ;).

I used to look forward to time off work too but then it would pass by SO fast and often I would not remember all of it or I would have ruined parts of it (due to heavier than usual drinking) and then suddenly it would be over and I would just feel let down. Now I can actually enjoy time off and it feels restorative rather than draining. Good idea to make the extra cash :) 
Wow great post. I totally relate to this. Thank you!
