I wrote a long text here and when I went to post it got deleted so here's the tl;dr version:..I have no self control and my issues are worse than I thought. Not only can I not control my drinking but I have relapsed into old eating disorder habits and am generally quite a mess. ..Thank you all for the support. I'm going to see a doctor and try to figure out why I'm doing this to myself. Xoxo

You can always come back. Hope you find some help.
Yes do come back. 
I'm glad you are seeking out the help you need! You don't have to say goodbye to this sub though!
As someone who is an alcoholic and has an eating disorder I can appreciate how awful this all feels. Come back if you ever want to talk.
I wish you well. We'll leave the light on for you.

You only created your account eight days ago and you're giving up already? I'm sorry to hear that. I hope that you soon realize that all of this ***is*** in your control and you decide to put in the work that is required to live a healthy and happy life. ..Most of us were a mess when we started. However it gets cleaned up one day at a time. I never every thought I could *not* be a mess and I was convinced I could never be happy. Turns out that was my own flawed logic and once I started to put the work in my life changed immeasurably. This can be true for you as well but you've got to make the choice.
