Throwaway for this because obvious reasons.  .  I am on the last quarter of DUI court I have had a few relapses that I admitted but haven't gotten to the "this is your last chance" situation with the judge.  .  .  I have been on-and-off relapsing nearly the entire time; I admitted scamming the SCRAM bracelet when I had it prior to my conviction and I chart and monitor the colors called every day. In desperate situations I have diluted my UA directly into my bladder usually with water until I started giving suspicious specimens then used urine-colored juices and other liquids anything that wouldn't offset the PH check on the instant cups. Part-way through this I started personal counseling and taking Naltrexone (not sure how this sub views that) and anti-depressants.  .  .I always knew I needed to get myself right. I lurk on this sub and others and kept telling myself "I'll get to it I'll be that person!" But then something anything would happen and I'd go back to the liquor store my head low my heart sinking my wants desperate. .  .  The last time I admitted a relapse my court counselor made it clear without making me admit it that it didn't surprise them if I had relapsed often. I still think they know I have been continuing.  .  .  Then the other week happened.  .  .  Other than one random time early on and when I'd admit relapse none of my UAs ever went to the lab just the instant cup. So one morning my color is called I was really close to being able to provide a normal clean specimen but I've been duping the system so long I'm still worried and anxious. Also my wife re-arranged our bedroom over the weekend and found an old weed stash of hers. I didn't partake of course but she did and we were intimate afterwards. I'm not sure how much of it might've been a dream or what but I swear I was awake and I felt like I got a slight contact high (I have an incredibly low tolerance to marijuana peers in the past have said perhaps I might even have some kind of allergy) so that scared me as well.  .  .So I did something really desperate and stupid.  .  .I loaded my near-empty bladder with base water and bad apple juice; and when I went to my UA I had to fill out paperwork that my specimen was going to be sent to the lab!.  .I knew another admitted relapse and I'd be looking at enough short-term jail to lose my job of 4 years at minimum. So like a coward I faked it pissed in the cup and submitted.  ..That was 14 days ago I've been anxious as sin since and finally last week learned that I am not on the docket for court. I'm not sure if I'm through this but at least it's not an immediate expulsion. The counselors act...funny towards me but still normal enough I guess?  .  .  The hell I went through the last shift of work anticipating that this would be my last shift then court then immediate termination from the program then fulfilling at least a few months of jail of my original term; losing my job my wife my apartment my car...everything.  .  .  Now I literally feel like Scrooge on Christmas Day...that UA might still come and bite me but if they were going to drop me I think they would've already and I'm not taking it for granted.  .  Thanks for reading I needed to share and obviously can't irl yet. But above all IWNDWYT!.

And people wonder why we associate the word insanity with this disease. 
"The hell I went through......"  Complete this line yourself any alcoholic/addict. Whether it's internal or external hell this pretty much sums it up. I hope things work out for you. I will not be drinking with you today.
