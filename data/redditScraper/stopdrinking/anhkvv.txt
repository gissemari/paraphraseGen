.....I have so much catching up to do. 20 years of pickling myself daily really took a toll mentally and physically- I'm still struggling with so much emotionally reality. But I'm sober and even though 8 months and 15 days is impressive it's nothing compared to nearly 20 years of abusing that crutch. I honestly do miss the bars the scene the glorified  fuck it  mentality the whole feeling of that drink hitting and warming your stomach. What I don't miss is the sweaty anxiety in the morning especially before work that shaky nauseated feeling before I'd make my  hair of the dog  drink in the morning before work. The constant consumption of my life controlled by a drink. I enjoy waking up and the little passions I have now like making my own special coffee drinks eating healthy the gym etc etc. of course I miss the chaos I'm an alcoholic I think a lot of us that are alcoholics see chaos as  the norm  - but in 8 and a half months I've made more progress making amends with people dealing with loss the hard way the sober way and getting on a path of actually feeling feelings the good AND the bad. It's a lot harder not just living for the day the moment and drowning your problems away. I'll cheers my coffee to another sober day today hopefully another tomorrow.

I miss the chaos too! Not as much as I don't miss the hangovers though. 
Spot on..that thing of missing the chaos is so true but it's so worth it. Iwndwyt.

Yes! Sounds like the trade-off has been well worth it!
I caught myself missing the chaos today. "Some people just want to watch the world burn." Ohhh boy.
Beautiful! Proud of you.

You may be clean from alcohol but you definitely aren't sober.
