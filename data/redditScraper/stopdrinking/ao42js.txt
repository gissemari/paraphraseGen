Taking my first vacation to the Philippines with no plan of alcohol however it's going to be a struggle. Bars/pubs/people enjoying themselves on every corner.  Wish me luck!  I will not drink with you this vacation!

Being on day 4 this is the single most freightening thing for me. I will be in southern france in July. Been there many times and it is just hardwired for me to rose wine.   .This thing actually made me think I wont make it in the first place. Then I heard about the concept of "one day at a time /only today" and I am sober 4 days now.   .If you dont mind could you share with me how it went? I assume you will make it through sober (I know you will!). and if so could you let me know your magic sauce how you made it once you are back?..I count on you my friend. Stay sober.
You will be enjoying yourself too including the mornings!.IWNDYWT
I hear you! I'm taking a trip to Hawaii in 2 weeks. It will be my first vacation sober.  I'm looking forward to not wasting time drinking in the hotel room and sleeping.  ..Stay strong and you got this!  IWNDWYT
