Life is amazing.. I may have just had the greatest year of my life. .For those of you out there still struggling the hardest part for me was letting go completely and admitting my issue. My first year was terrible. You get used to an old life this new life of constant insight has taught me to be patient and caring. .It gets better and easier if you want it to. .
