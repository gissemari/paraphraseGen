Laying on the couch watching some football and starting to fall asleep. I honestly can't remember the last time I went to bed sober. I did not drink today. I will not drink tomorrow or the rest of the week...This weekend my family is leaving to go to a nieces birthday party. I can't go. Gotta work. Called my brother-in-law who knows I'm struggling and he said he'd come down and hang out this weekend. I will not drink this weekend either. Love that guy.

Sober sleep is awesome. Ive had 9 so far 10 tonight. Sweet dreams.
Congrats! Keep it up.
Way to get through day 1 that is amazing those early days can be some of the hardest...keep up the great work :)
Congrats!
Boom! Good day good plan good on ya!
Awesomeness! Getting through that first day can be rough but you did it!
I have found that sleep has been much more refreshing from sleeping sober. I'm so much more energized during the day (even if waking up for work is still a pain). While alcohol may help you fall asleep faster (aka blackout/pass out) it affects the quality of your rest: http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/news/20130118/alcohol-sleep#1..Day 1 can be tough so that's such a benefit that you have a brother-in-law who was there to support you...Keep on keeping on. It won't always be easy but it will get better each day if you stick to your guns.
