[edited to remove a link]..So what inspired my last drunk January 16th 2017 was three things. ..First; it had been about four months since my last drink. I'd started a one-year break from drinking for my son's tenth birthday; I thought putting down the bottle for a while would help me properly collate my fecal matter. But after four months I felt I had proof of concept that I could stop drinking... I'd even made it through the holidays sober... but why should I keep missing out on all the fun that alcohol brought to my life? ..Second point: A friend who had struggled with her own relapses pointed me to Annie Grace and *This Naked Mind*. Holy cow. That book dragged out all the reasons my subconscious was persuaded I liked drinking held them up to the light and one by one they vanished in a puff of logic. That book helped me see what alcohol really was; it was hidden in plain sight the whole time as the root word of inTOXICated. Anyway in the book she suggests a final drink so that idea was kicking around in my head. ..Third item: I'd read a few biographies of Ray Kroc of McDonald's fame and happened to pick up the new biography of his wife Joan at the library. I had no idea he was a heavy drinker... but it was a puzzle piece that completed the picture in various episodes of his life. Anyway his drink of choice was what Whiskey Reviewer calls the  super cheap whiskey brand Early Times.   I'd never heard of it but as a long time buyer of super cheap liquor I was curious about the appeal...So those three ideas coalesced into a trip to the liquor store one kid-free night. (Early Times was on the bottom shelf.) Back home armed with a glass of ice I settled down in my living room and proceeded to put a serious dent in the bottle. ..When I opened my eyes the next morning I was sprawled across the couch. Half-eaten food was on the coffee table and lights were on all over the house. As I'd done so many times before I tried think back: what's the last thing I remember doing? ..It wasn't even a fun drunk. The rest of the bottle went down the drain... it's nice to have a story to tell about my last drunk but I don't miss all those mornings noons and nights I used to ~~spend~~ waste drinking. ..TIL Prohibition started on this same date in 1920. A coincidence but a happy one. ..Thanks for reading thanks Annie Grace thanks SD... I will not drink with you today!..Brian
