This is a great sub that offers hope advice encouragement etc.....However I've just relapsed and looking through the sidebar I feel like someone in my position doesn't have a clear place to go for support in getting back on track...Is there another sub for such support?..Thank you in advance for any help you can offer.

i think you can post anywhere. no need for a separate sub. there seems be plenty of relapse posts...well done for checking in here again. tomorrow is a new day and you can start again.
Welcome.  You've come to the right place.  What do you think led you to relapse?
how about here when you're not currently under the influence ..what's going on?
