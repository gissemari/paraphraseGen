4 years together. 3 and a half of those I was drinking with him it seemed normal came clean that it was a problem I was hiding about 6 months ago when we moved in together coincidentally. ..First four months of sobriety were great. I was still hanging out and doing a lot of the social stuff we did together before and felt pretty good with it. Active in meetings but no sponsor. Two relapses later it's a whole different ball game. Cue several intense discussions with him about how hard it's become for me how I can't be around the same people/places/things anymore. He's supportive and wants to help however he can but I feel so sad and lonely when he goes out with his friends and I feel like I can't go any more. I feel like I'm grieving constantly. I'm grieving the death of the person I used to be and the fun we used to have together. I'm feeling so alone and like I'm grieving our relationship even though we're trying to make it work. Why am I in so much emotional pain all the time? Today I actually got on my knees and prayed to God to help me and I have never believed in God. ..I feel so miserable! When will it get better? Sober me is slogging through all the shitty emotional stuff I never dealt with and I feel like I can't fucking handle it!

When I first quit drinking it was an INSANE rollercoaster of emotions ups downs tears anger...and being in a relationship at the same time is very tough.  My spouse was not open to couples therapy though I think it might have helped..so I continued to just do therapy for myself. ..My spouse also continued to go out and party and insisted we not get rid of all alcohol in the house (although we got rid of all of my most favorite temptations).  It wasn't until I built a support system through AA through non-drinking hobbies with family friends supportive of my sobriety and by dealing with my feelings through therapy and working with a sponsor.  ..My first 3 months especially were a tumultuous time for me as an individual.  I wasn't numb anymore!  I had surrounded myself with drinking people drinking places and my entire social life was formed in a way that I could always drink...and suddenly I was alone and my partner could still "party" and I couldn't. ..But then I made a list.  An honest list.  Of why I quit in the first place.  The things I had done. The guilt I felt.   The situations I had gotten myself into.  The people I'd harmed.   The times I'd let people down.....And when I looked at that list I realized how important it was for me to stay sober.  No matter what my partner did...no matter what my former "drinking buddies" did or said about me quitting....I needed to stop because I hated the person I had become.  ..And my life was forever changed as was my relationship after I hit the 5 month sober mark and my husband was diagnosed with aggressive cancer..(for the first time).  ..I was sober.  I had support.  I wasn't alone...and I was able to overcome some challenges I could NEVER have done if I had remained that former person.  And I realized how important the person I married was to me...no matter how insane troubled and problematic our relationship had been to that point...because when I realized I might lose him and later when I became his primary caregiver I knew it was the right thing to do.  ..Emotions come.  Emotions go.  It is ok to not be ok sometimes...but drinking in my case will never improve the situation.  I am a better person spouse friend and family member by being sober and putting one foot after the other even when it is tough.  ..You can do this..and you aren't alone.  This is a large community and 24/7 SOMEONE is likely to be on their computer or phone looking at this subreddit.  They may have 10 years sober or 1 day...and we all can learn from each other and support each other.  ..
It helps me to remember that grief is a part of the healing process.  It's a part of how we get better.  I hope you find some peace in that. Hang in there!
