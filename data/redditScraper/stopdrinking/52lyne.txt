I've been a struggling alcoholic for years. I make it for about nine months then lose it. But I still silently follow you all. I've commented a few times. But nothing serious. But here I am trying to be serious. You all give me strength and I will try my best. ..I'm not a praying man nor do I follow AA anymore (there's a smart meeting near me but it's only once a week.) but please send me your thoughts.  I'm here with you. I will not drink today.

Welcome to Team Sobernaut! I found u/coolcrosby's baby steps (https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) to be a huge help for me especially in the early days. I'm also not religious in the traditional sense and you may want to see if Refuge Recovery offers any meetings in your area. (Haven't been to a meeting myself but heard about them from another user here as an alternative to AA meetings.) Happy to join you in not drinking today!
Sending you my thoughts.  These things work in two directions by the way.  I'm having just an overall low day but getting to lean on someone as they lean on me gives me a little pickup...Today I won't drink with you.
Glad you're here. Congrats on 3 days! That's huge.
Hey Scotti - glad you're breaking your silence :). Congrats on day 3! Hope to see you here a lot more now.
I found that coming out on this sub and participating has shifted my mindset in unexpected ways. I was also a lurker with short stints of "sober" doing it on my own. I commit to at least replying every day and so far it has been invaluable. I'll not drink with ya today!
Welcome! Thanks for being here. We're just like you. :)
thinking of you - congrats on making it through days 1 2 and 3. they're tough going! :)
Keep on reading and posting!  This subreddit was my lifeline in early sobriety and continues to be a source of strength now.
Three days is a hell of a greatcstart. I will not drink with you!
