Not drinking with all 50000+ of you today.

High five to all 50000 of us! I won't drink with y'all today
This is awesome. I remember joining (originally -- under another username) and there were around 400 of us. We celebrated 500 users. Frank was the mod. Victoria was a new member and shortly after became a mod. ..I myself went on to get almost 3 years and had a set back..Hope to see this get to 100K with you guys!
This one of those occasions where you can feel little fear jumping on the table and shouting "next round's on me everyone!!" only to hear a thundering chorus of "no thanks I'm good with water!" 
And those are just the ones willing to recognize it somewhat!
Very cool.  Rock on sobernauts.

It's good to have that perspective. I find it easy to fall into the trap of thinking that I'm one of the few with a problem and that everyone else can drink just fine so what am I doing wrong? But in reality alcohol is a destructive force in many people's lives and I'm far from alone.
Glad to be a part of this community
I'm glad after a couple of years of lurking to go from being a lurker to actively a part of that 50k.  SD is amazing!
