I literally hate myself right now and slipping down that path that made me drink so much in the first place. Any tips are appreciated!

I read recently that if you fell down when crossing a bridge would you get up and keep walking or go back to the start of the bridge and start there? I fell so many times before it stuck and I look back now and they were just pitstops along the road to recovery. Regrets are a waste of valuable time that is best served getting sober. Don't forget but move on
I think of it like this: If I hate something why am I going to want to help it get better? That includes hating myself. ..I find that being in therapy helps a lot with wallowing - I can wallow for a few days but I know once I'm in that room again neither she nor I have any time for that shit. So I can go in and be like "I felt like shit for a day and here is my plan." ..I also find that self hatred it a lazy emotion for me because it can prevent me from doing any work on myself. "Oh I hate myself I don't deserve to get better I suck and should just lie here in a ditch..." and so on.
