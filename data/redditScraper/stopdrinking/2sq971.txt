Yes just another day one day a time and without badgebot I would have missed it...To those new or struggling I had a hard time in the beginning slipped and slid from Feb to Sept 1 1987.  Patted myself on the back with a six-pack - had issues disputes and other problems with AA and in retrospect made it harder than it needed to be.  Except It was what I had to do to get to where I am today.  .Thing I want to say is I did not do this alone I was an isolate and had to learn to open up to ask for help to accept it even when not asked for...Once "I got it" recovery has been pretty easy - certainly easier than the path I was on when drinking.  I've been through some shit and drinking was never an option...This is hurried - am trying to make my 8 am step meeting.  But I don't have to say it all now I'll be around. **I am not cured**..Will post a link to my saturday shares later .....edit:  my story: [part1](http://redd.it/1c9hj8)                 .                       [part2](http://redd.it/1c9hrb)...And finally thanks to all of you for helping me on my journey.

Congratulations!!!!!!! Times 10000!!!!!!!!!!!!
You are such a rock in the online recovery community Slip thank you for creating and fostering r/dinosaursinrecovery; thank you for inviting me to moderate that subreddit with you; thank you for your inspiring weekly posts from behind bars; thank you for the very cool ana-log sobriety coins; and most of all thanks for being my first friend on SD and encouraging me to continue to share.  
Congrats slip you're a great a asset to this community!
Congrats! I don't know you and I haven't been around for long but I enjoy reading your posts/comments and what you have to share. Thank you for all you do!
Nice job man!.. I wish I had some of the levelheaded comments you've made on here in the past. You are not infallible but you definitely get things right more than you get them wrong...Keep coming back!!! :)
Nope - thank you. You're stalwart and an inspiration. ..Welcome to quintuple digits. .
Congrats. 
Congrats and best wishes!
Congratulations!  What a cool number.
Congratulations and keep it up!
Congratulations!
oh my god he's over 9000 /coudln't help it
Wowzers that a buncha zeros. Makes me think of the fact that we all had to start at day 1 from that first 0. ..Thank you so much for all you do to make this universe a little bit brighter. You do shine my friend. :-)  Congrats!
Congratulations and thanks for your wisdom!
Amazing and inspirational congratulations!!
Congrats to you. I've read your shares but I'm excited to read them again...Thanks for all you do here. You've certainly had a hand in my own recovery that's for sure.
Wow!  So many familiar folks are here to say congratulations to you! .Thanks for bringing us all together like you do. Good job!
/u/Slipacre you spelt exceptional wrong in your title..
Congrats Mr. 10k!
Way to go! Now waking up for a 8am meeting on a weekend? That's dedication!! Best
Congrats! A very nice round number!
Fantastic accomplishment. Much respect to you.
Congratulations!  I have enjoyed your insightful posts since long before I de-lurked recently. You are an inspiration and positive force for many...On a purely aesthetic note 10001 is gonna look pretty cool tomorrow!
10^4 all right!  Thanks for your inspiration today and every day.
Thanks for what you do here Slipacre. 10000 is truly amazing but it didn't really compute to me (like a trillion dollars - hard to visualize) until I viewed those 10000 days with a perspective I can better understand:..You had your *last* drink 4 years before I had my *first* drink and you were then sober the 23 years I was drinking... And I'm no young whippersnapper. ..That's just amazing. 
Congratulations on your recovery and your quintuple digits!
So awesome.  Congratulations!  I want what you (and several others here) have which is why I tend to pour over your posts.  Thank you thank you thank you for all you do :)
Thank you for being here.

Slipacre your grounded insight on "unavailable" people has helped me tremendously. e-Meeting someone with that knowledge came at a constructive time and provided some of the strength I needed to move forward with taking care of myself.  Each day you remain strongly sober radiates support to others--now exponentially!  Thank you so much.
So we're measuring sobriety in orders of magnitude now? If that's the case it's your 10^(fourth) bday. Amazing stuff
AWESOME! Congratulations!!    ..Also this is an amazing post and I love everything you said in it!!!
Helluva job! HUGE number well done!
10 thousand days is unfathomable to me. I'm shocked as it is to have gone so long without a drink. 
10000 wow. I hope I live long enough to get there.
That. Is. Awesome.
Pfft. Show-off :)
I'm pretty sure you've been sober more time than I've been alive ;) . Great job! 
**High^FIVE!** to one of my heroes! Your wise and clever words make me think and very often make me laugh. I love that about you. 
Good work Slipacre. Keep on keeping on. 
Congratulations sir. Thanks for everything.
Congrats big time. Enjoyed reading your story for some reason I thought you were younger than me (I think everybody's younger than me) but we're about the same age. I hope that lots of people read it and realize that AA's not a storefront Jesus church in disguise!..And hey strychnine's not that bad! They used to use it to cut weak acid to give it more of a buzz and it always gave me a backache.
congrats man! 10000 days is legendary.
Thanks for always servin' up the wisdom around here. It has helped me immensely. 
Congratulations Slip. You set an amazing example one we can all aspire to. Thank you for being there for all of us to remind us that even after almost 30 years we are still uncured and must remain vigilant. ..Really I'm surprised no one has [made this reference](http://cdn.bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/tool10000dayscover.jpeg) yet.
Congratulations on your day and all the ones before. Thanks for all you contribute here.
Thank you for being here. You have helped and inspired me.
Amazing achievement... thanks for sharing your wisdom here! Onto the next 10000
Thanks for showing me the way. Over time your posts have triggered some of the most beneficial thoughts in my road to recovery. 
Good for you slip  you deserve this.  Keep it up \o/
I'm terrified that you say you're not cured despite 10K days of sobriety..Thank you for sharing.
Congratulations Slipacre!  You have been such a support to everyone here  and you've earned your 10000 days. :)
Congrats!..Also: for the longest time I thought you were actually a prisoner and I was surprised they let you reddit from prison.  I'm not too bright.
Nice. :)  Congrats. 
I'm not cured either. See you around. .
Congrats! You're an inspiration :-)
Respect.
Totally going to tuck in and read your story tonight.  Thank you for everything.  I was a lone isolated drinker too so I know how hard it is to blow your own cover and ask for help... and then stick to it when you're home alone!!  ;)  I hope I get to see 10000 one day too!! I'm eating cake for YOU right now! :)
Wonderful!  The miracle of the stripper!  That's a defining moment for sure.  LOve the 'Joy: Use It or Lose It' book as well.  I think every alcoholic needs to be cognizant of their compulsion to kill joy sometimes. I am aware of this in me and I am going to bookmark that book! Thanks again!..GDD
I'm always late to the party but WOW Slip! This is an awesome milestone one we'd never get to celebrate by AA's measure of years. Your name is one of the few that appear in red on my screen. I value your perspective and your delivery--you have such a way with words (and pictures) dare I say "special" (well it is to me anyway). You're like the backbone of SD. Reading your posts and comments always reminds me the importance of staying humble...So congrats on [10000!](http://i.imgur.com/Hsejylm.jpg) Yeah!!!
congrats..remission is better than participation in my own destruction
Your humility and willingness to share has been inspiring and so helpful for me. The posts from the prison meetings have really hit home as well as all your conversation about self esteem struggles. Thank you /u/Slipacre!
