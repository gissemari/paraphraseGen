Seriously when does the energy kick in? I swear  I had way more pep in the morning while drinking. Now I struggle to wake up greet the morning with a string of swear words NEED a coffee and even piss myself off with how grumpy I am for the first two hours of the day. For the record I am generally a cheerful person...Yay to starting my second week. Not going to drink today.

I always had wondered about that myself. I think it's because you don't sleep well it's easier to wake up after drinking. Now that your sleep is deeper it's harder to wake up. It gets easier though just allow you body time to rest and repair. None of this is scientific just what I have reasoned.
relax your body has a lot of repairs to do.  It will take time  your good cheer will return....and more
Working on day 5 here--congrats on your time.  For as long as i can remember every morning i turn my phone sound on in case my wife has a problem on her way to work.  She gets going before me in the mornings.  I always exchange a kiss wish her a good day and then i hit the snooze button.  I didn't hear anything this morning.  I was asleep so very hard.  I texted her a couple hours later to see if in fact i was sleeping and if i was mean to her this morning.  I had to check.  She confirmed i was just in deep sleep.  I have a problem with morning anger too.  An hour later i sit here very wide eyed and very alert with my coffee feeling pretty good.  Hopefully our day will go well.
