Hey all! Last week I made my first post in here. I originally drank three 24-ounce cans of high-alcohol content beer every night. I outlined my plan on cutting down to two cans a night for a week and wean myself down to one can a week this week. I promised I'd follow up once a week on how my weaning process is going so here I am...I'm proud to say that I've stuck to the plan of two cans a night for 7 straight nights up to last night. It wasn't easy at first; I suffered mild nightmares for the first two nights and I've been suffering mild memory problems. Normally my memory is like a jaw trap - but I immediately started noticing that I couldn't remember stuff I learned in class. Still struggling with that part; I'm hoping it's normal and temporary. ..I've decided to modify my plan slightly because I noticed that over 20 years of non-stop drinking I definitely need to wean more gradually than originally planned. Starting tonight I'm going down to 1 24 oz. can and a 12 oz. can of lower-level alcohol beer per night this week. Then go down to one can a night next week. ..On another note I've been following a lot of your posts and I have to say that you all are an inspiration to me. Thank you for sharing your struggles thoughts progress and even setbacks. It helps me feel like I'm not alone. I hope I've also helped some of you wonderful souls with my comments as well. Hugs to you all.

Congrats on making some progress. Not sure if I am allowed to say this here but if you are trying to taper alcohol you might want to look into Kratom. I have been using Kratom the last couple weeks and it kills all my desire for alcohol. Today is my first day without Kratom and I am going to take a break from it for a while and see how it goes. I was never able to quit anything cold turkey alcohol or nicotine. For nicotine I had to taper off using vape pens at lower nicotine levels which eventually worked because I don't use nicotine but like once every 6 months now. The problem with alcohol was that I could not taper down to lower dosage because after a few drinks I lose self control and I drive to the store to get more EVERY TIME. Kratom is mildly relaxing and has a mild mood boost. It also does not mix well the alcohol and the thought of drinking sounds horrible. Kratom is not perfect and its illegal in some US states but it has helped me. It is easier to quit kratom as well for me because I have quit it in the past for about 2 years and it was no big deal way easier than nicotine or alcohol. Anyways good luck to you! IWNDWYT
Congrats on your progress!
