Hi..I've been struggling to get sober for about a year now. Me getting drunk is usually to cure extreme boredom. I'm a pretty isolated person who lacks activities to replace being buzzed...Any and all solutions accepted.

Last time I tried to get sober I took up woodworking. Hard to do in an apartment building but I managed to make a table! I hope to get back into it again. Very zen activity.

Drinking seemed like the ultimate elixir that provided me with "instant gratification" in almost any situation. Drinking was such an "easy" form of entertainment that I stopped making any effort to entertain myself in other way. However the temporary buzz that alcohol provided came at a very steep price. Drinking is like borrowing happiness from tomorrow..It has taken some effort and creativity to search out new activities that bring me joy and true happiness but it's been well worth it! .Here is a quote that helps me quite a bit when I'm feeling weak: "It may be a better night with alcohol but it's a better life without it."
I've been hiking doing yoga gardening organizing my household reading a ton working through a backlog of video games re-watching movies I don't remember cooking exploring my city (I can't believe how much I haven't done here) meditating and learning to drive. I have a list where I jot things down too for the days I am uninspired. In the beginning I just started taking walks and seeing where I ended up! The world is your oyster! 
I like to write stories song lyrics poetry work on game maps in RPG Maker jog clean and take an online course when I'm bored.

I finally realized that it wasn't *lack of willpower* as my issue but rather *Lack of In Real Life Support*.  That's all I needed!..I went to meetings and immediately found people who understood what I was experiencing.  I got tools resources support and fellowship to first stop drinking and then to live sober...Now I just forgo ONE drink today - The First One..Never been happier!
Meetings golf bicycling running cooking reading more meetings :)
biking..hiking..eating chocolate cake..playing pokemon go..hangin with my kid..intervention binges..masturbating..redditing..reading in mass quantities..basically anything that keeps my time occupied with not drinking....
