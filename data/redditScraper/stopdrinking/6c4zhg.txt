Hey! thanks for stopping by. I'm glad you found some stories that helped you. This subreddit has been super wonderful for me but mostly I found that getting out of my house and getting my ass to some AA meetings really helped me with cravings and the difficulty putting down the drink. Stick around!
welcome glad to have you here!
