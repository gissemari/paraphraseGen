* Waking up feeling like I am about to die..* Having to lie to my family about what I did last night..* Eating half of my fridge to keep my stomach full enough to not black out while I drink two bottles of liquor..* Chugging water nonstop while feeling dehydrated and having side effects like heart palpitations and anxiety. I wish I never had to give up a day to have my wife take care of me for this..* Ignoring my son and wife. My son turned 1 about a month ago and I don't regret my goal of sobriety at all. I tried to quit drinking before he was born but I failed miserably. It wasn't until he came into my life that I began the long process of turning my life around to try to change everything...A year in to my very long process of staying sober and I can fully say that I love my son so much that I will never look at alcohol as a goal ever again. I still struggle with it as an addiction and I'm only about 15 days out from my last drink but a struggle with sobriety in between is better than the alternative...It's been really painful to reverse my outlook and a lot of meetings to AA seem like they aren't doing anything to my mind but they slowly help. My son is my goal I need to spend time with him and enjoy my life with him. He makes me happier than I could ever ask for...I never discount my wife and she always joins me in my recovery but she knows that the one that defines my outlook is my son. It's not that I don't love my wife she knows that my relationship with her has now been interlinked between our son and her and I. It's a fully committed family to me. She's my wife he's my son. I want to exist for my son to teach him how to be. She's not always happy with my choices in life but she joins me in trying to be smarter for our family. That sounds a lot like normal life...Alcohol still pops up in my mind but it immediately causes problems and my wife and my son help me to turn it around. I am not sober like I would like to be but I have the best support structure I could ask for. Even when I fail at sobriety I have a family who will join me again in my next attempt. My son doesn't know better but my wife does. My son just does a really damn good job at making me realize that I either die drinking or watch him grow up. I want to watch him grow up. ..Album of my motivation because this guy makes my world better: https://imgur.com/a/zpTcWFH

Aw he is beautiful!! Those curls!! You seem madly in love with your little family. You can do this.
Love this I'm in the same situation as you but with 2 little girls. Not being hungover in the mornings makes life that much better. And makes you that much better of a parent. Keep up the good work IWNDWYT 
Daaawwww he's a cute little booger haha. Congrats on your 15 days!! I did the opposite of you though - I would eat the fridge when i wasn't drinking but while drinking my brain went to "don't eat it will fk up how much you just drank". Crazy right. Anyway I don't miss is either - My body on the outside started looking like the damage I know I did on the inside so I am sticking to eating healthy as my thing to not necessarily obsess about but yeah... being healthy full circle mentally physically and emotionally are my new jam. We live in a vast world and I wanna see as much of it as possible but I cannot do that from the bottom of the bottle....[High Five](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg)
