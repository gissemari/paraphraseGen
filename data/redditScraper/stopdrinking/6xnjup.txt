And it's only Saturday! Instead of drinking this weekend I got up early and had breakfast with a friend and went fishing on a crummy rainy day and I'm loving it. .   I also saw this post and I thought it might be a good pick me up for those struggling on a holiday weekend...   "Consciously dying to old aspects of ourselves is followed by rebirth. It is important not to judge our healing experience by how "good" we feel as we move through it because it will always be uncomfortable. The pain and discomfort (shadows) are the dragons or inner demons that guard the gates to liberation. They restrict those who are not ready. They function as an invitation and a deterrent. The storm exists within and is reflected without. Diving into this storm is a rite of passage." ..   Read that again! You can't judge progress by how good you feel because it will always be uncomfortable. .   We are all warriors fighting these demons and it hurts it's tiring and it's something you'll do forever. But it's about gaining traction and killing your old self as well because they are no longer a part of you. They serve no purpose and are an enemy to the healthy mind and body..   I will not be drinking with you this weekend!

Great quote - do you have a source for it? 
That's pretty good.  For me though I find that if I live one day at a time life can be pretty rewarding.  Dragons voices mental obsessions--a lot of that disappeared fell away as I embraced recovery recovery meetings and the fellowship of others who had the same desire to stop drinking that I have.
