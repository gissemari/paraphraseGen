A couple weeks ago I made a big tough decision: to close my struggling business. It's been weighing on me for years and was absolutely the trigger that helped push my drinking to acutely problematic areas...I haven't yet made any big moves for actually getting out of the space as there's a backlog of work that needs to be completed but just making the decision has freed my mind SO much...I'm finally enjoying a lot of the benefits of not drinking...I wasn't allowing myself to have them when still carrying all that stress...FINALLY I'm rising from bed early. I'm finally really enjoying my morning coffee. I'm finally getting back into exercise and eating (mostly) well. I'm finally reaching out to friends. I'm finally starting to enjoy the little things. I'm finally paring down my chore list. I'm finally prioritizing life not just my work load...It feels awesome. So much work left to do and much muck to work through but I'm doing it. I'm making huge changes and preparing for the next chapter in my life...Thanks for being here you all. I think I'd be dead if I hadn't found SD.
