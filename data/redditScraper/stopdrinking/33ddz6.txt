This is the longest I've ever gone without alcohol since I turned 21 - I'm 28 now.  On Monday April 6th I experienced my first symptoms of a DT from withdrawal.  I had binged to no end over the weekend and it finally caught up with me.  It was the scariest moment of my life.  I thought I was going to die...Over two weeks have passed and here's what is different in my life so far.....-I went to my doctor and I'm scheduled for a liver test in 3 months.  It'll be good to know if I've done any serious damage over the years.  ..-I'm struggling with boredum.  I go home after work and play video games or watch Netflix.  I run when the weather is nice but I don't have much of a social life since I moved to a new city last August.  I'm planning on trying new things but my energy levels at the end of the day are a bit low at the moment.  I've been planning on going to AA but just haven't made myself do it yet...-I have money again.  I depleted my savings over the past 9 months but I'm starting to build it back up.  I went through my expenses since the new year began and I was sickened by how much alcohol based purchases I had made.  Better to put that money to good use now...-Health.  Although my energy goes up and down my overall health seems to be improving.  I was sweating so much days after I drank.  My groin neck palms and feet were drenched all day.  I didn't look good.  Now I occasionally get a flash of sweaty palms but that's it.  My skin is looking better and my face's puffiness is going down.  Hygiene is now possible.  No more bleeding gums oily hair or sweat stains on my clothing.  I'm losing weight and although I have a sweet tooth I'm eating really well.  ..-Mental health.  Anxiety and depression are not even close to where they were.  During hangovers I would experience manic episodes - glad those are done.  It's a different anxiety now mostly wondering what do I do now and what do I want.  Hard questions to ask yourself but it'll take some time to figure those out...Anyway sorry for the length just wanted to put it out there.  Here's to making it another day.

Sounds like you are off to a great start!  Yay for you! ..The biggest flag for me in your post is the struggling with boredom..I understand your energy levels are down... but please start looking for fun things to do in sobriety...Meetups for hiking walking foodies bird watching... something?????????..Volunteer once a month maybe?  Food bank?  Park cleanup? ..I suggest these things to get you something sane and productive to do so you don't fall into the common rut of  "there is no life in sobriety" ..
Good job on 15 days!  I used to treat my boredom with booze but after treating it with enough booze I would just fall asleep then be too stunned to enjoy anything anyway.  I have 60 days still get bored but less often so I can attest that the boredom part will get better if you stay sober.
