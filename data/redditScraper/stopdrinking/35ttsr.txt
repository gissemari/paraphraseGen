Yesterday was my first day.  I've quit and relapsed more times than I can count - always giving in to the need to be emotionally numb.  I barely made it through last night (there is alcohol in the house for another family member) but my last thoughts before falling asleep were of giving up and giving in AGAIN.  I need help in re-framing this struggle from something I "should" do b/c it's the right thing to something I "choose" to do b/c I care about what happens to me.  I am humbly open to advice and direction.

Connect with a support group IRL...AA SMART others...they can give you (for FREE!) the tools and techniques you need to re-frame the struggle and wrap your head around it...Just quitting drinking (without addressing any of the issues that leads you to drink) is just a waste of time and emotional energy. ..Getting "sober" and getting into "Recovery" is about healing...not-drinking is a great first step...but it's just a first step!..Welcome /u/momof2poms! You've got this!.
You deserve to be sober - the joy of waking up and not wondering about the night before the ability to be in control of your emotions rather than having to numb them the chance to enjoy being around family and friends while remembering it the next day never having to apologize for angry/mean things said while drunk never again being ashamed of your drinking. You can do this! I love the move to care about yourself - you deserve self love. This is something I have struggled with all my life but as it's starting to become possible for me it's just making life better and better for me =) I hope that you can find an IRL support group and maybe consider talking to the family member who keeps alcohol in the house if at all possible. It's easier (especially in the beginning) without temptation readily available. 
Sobriety is awesome! It just takes time to realize the awesomeness. Change is hard for all of us and choosing to live your life in sobriety rather than as a drunk is a *huge* change. Congratulations on *your* decision to do this for *you*!
I found [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/17hwpk/for_those_struggling_with_the_label_alcoholic_and/) and it helped me choose to quit for good rather than a temporary hiatus.  ..I think that quitting in terms of it being "the right thing to do" is difficult because it let's you say to yourself "Well sure I should quit because normal people don't drink like this but I'm not really that bad **yet.**  After all I haven't gotten a DUI/been fired from my job/been left by my spouse/lost the respect of my family/let down someone who depended on me ...**yet.**  I'll just keep drinking until some later date."..If you don't quit those **"yets"** will come sooner or later.  By choosing to quit for good you are choosing make those "not yets" into "never dids." ..It's not only about a long term payoff its about avoiding the inevitable bad outcome.  If you were on a train you knew was headed for a wreck how long would you wait to get off?
