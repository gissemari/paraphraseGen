Good evening SD. 8.55 pm here in the UK and I am happy to say the day has ended with me sober. Friday used to be a real binge session for me. Celebrating the end of the week and looking forward to the weekend etc. Not that I needed an excuse to drink. Anyhow tonight I am laying on my sofa watching Poirot and my treat to self has been some ice cream. In sobriety I think it is important to treat ourselves to a little something we like. After all when we are drunk and in that warped state of mind we beat ourselves up repeatedly. So I am going to practise being kind to myself. I hope my fellow sobernauts will do the same. Sending you best wishes especially those of us still struggling:-)

Congratulations! I'm excited for all of us waking up feeling great on a Saturday morning. Imagine! Have a lovely night. 
I lived in the UK for 2 years and while my countryfellows (I am Polish) like to drink a lot as in really really a lot what I saw on the streets on the weekends in the UK was somewhat mildly shocking even for me. I got to first hand experience what proper binge drinking sessions look like. Those memories still haunt me up till this day and serve as a memento to abstain from alcohol. IWNDWYT.
