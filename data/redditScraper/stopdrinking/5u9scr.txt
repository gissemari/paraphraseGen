There was a 4:30 pm work function today after a horrible day in my dept. There's always wine at these things which I used to love. Sanctioned drinking at work yay. Everyone was super bummed and angry by stuff that was discussed in a meeting this morning talking about going to the event to suck up free booze and then to the pub after. ..I physically felt my will drain away listening to this conversation. I had planned to go to the event but today I knew if I saw a glass of that shitty office wine I'd neck it and have another in my hand before I had a conscious thought. I wanted that feeling of release after the horrible day and the feeling of solidarity with my colleagues. And especially I wanted the feeling of both of those things at once of getting fucked up together because we're getting fucked over together. ..I felt like I had lost all sense of myself as a non drinker that I had really let go of my tether. (I've been having a lot of relapse dreams and it almost feels like I'd already broken the seal in my mind on some level too.) I did not expect to lose my conviction that I would not drink so easily so completely so suddenly. ..So I just panicked and got the hell out of there. The function was something I didn't absolutely have to attend even tho it would have been better career wise technically to go. But I knew I had zero chance of looking a glass of wine in the face and not drinking 10 of them. I grabbed my stuff and managed to book myself last minute into a spinning class and just went straight there. It was honestly the closest place I could think of to go where there was no booze. ..I'm home now and I know I should feel good I made the decisions I did. But I feel like shite tbh. I missed out on a feeling of togetherness I really wanted. I couldn't talk myself out of feeling sad by sayingoh it's just stupid boozy conversation with workmates. Because It really can feel really good to let loose with people feeling grim about the same stuff you feel grim about. And I felt how fragile my hold on sobriety is. I hope I have a few less relapse dreams for a while because it seems like they are sending me the message I've already fucked up so why not drink?..Tomorrow is another day tho. Despite everything I haven't drunk with you all today and maybe tomorrow I'll be better able to really feel good about that fact. Thanks for listening.

Great job! Feeling the need to decompress with co-workers you like is I think a very normal thing. But that would have been accomplished at too high of a price IMO...if you're anything like me which I assume you are since you're here :) I will not drink with you in solidarity tonight!
