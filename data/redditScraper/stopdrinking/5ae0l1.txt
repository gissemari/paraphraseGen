Well today was day 3 and my first day at work. Got to about 4 - nearing leaving time - and like clockwork my thoughts turned to a beer (well at least 2) on route home as I've done for so long. I panicked a little that I would cave maybe it was panic that I'd struggle without it but either way I've read some threads on here and I feel strong again. ..Thanks all no drink for me today.

Yes! My first day work and day 3 AND Halloween. Normally I would have "had a blast" giving out candy steadily getting trashed. I am so excited this year I am having a small bonfire at our house for kids and families to warm up while they get trick or treat from us. Not drinking with you and happy as hell!
Thoughts of drinking are totally normal for us alcys... especially us newly sober ones. It's how we so very unsuccessfully learnt to deal with life. Breaking a habit and an addiction is the best thing you can be doing. Take some solace you're doing the best thing you can. Thats how i calmed my withdrawal jitters today. Not drinking with you.
