Hello from Day 12. The second week has been way harder so far but the rewards are also starting to come. Here's my 12\-day dozen: ..1. My brain definitely isn't as sharp as it used to be but I have thought through and tackled a couple of complicated things that would have been impossible to approach a couple of weeks ago. It was arduous but I was capable of actually doing a good job. .2. I have gotten into work early every day this week and thus been able to leave early and do stuff after instead of slumping exhaustedly on the couch and then shuffling to bed. .3. I have already been more social in these two weeks than I have been for months (I was an isolate\-drink\-at\-home drinker). As a result I have a new freelance gig and I had a great dinner and conversation with a friend last night that really helped me figure out how to move forward on a short story I'm writing. .4. After I got home last night I found myself doing things I used to do mindlessly and happily before my drinking got so bad \-\- picking up listening to music opening a book deciding spontaneously to cook something healthy instead of just popping whatever in the microwave. .5. I am so much less impatient and irritable already \-\- I can feel myself just breathing and letting things go instead of clenching up about them (including traffic which is a miracle I tell you). .6. Physically my skin is returning to a normal color and I have lost five pounds of beer bloat..7. I didn't cancel band practice due to being too hungover or wanting to drink instead and we wrote most of a new song. .8. Made it through said band practice which is usually a beerfest sober and alert which mean I could contribute more than usual and was happy with my performance at the end. .9. I tried for a really great opportunity that I definitely would have talked myself out of or been too exhausted to contemplate while drinking (submitted everything last night just under the deadline whew!). .10. Have my first softball practice for the team I joined while pink\-clouding tomorrow. Heh. .11. My band released its first song June 1 on a compilation of 50 new bands to watch. We are working on the record right now and I feel excited instead of stressed and put out. .12. I am maybe ever so slightly starting to trust myself. ..There you go. Twelve reasons why not drinking has already been the best decision I've made in a long time. I'm wiped out from insomnia my body is doing weird resetty things and I'm struggling every day with cravings and obsessive thoughts but they are nothing I was not already having to deal with in some way or another while drinking minus all of the little rewards. I hope something good happens for you today to. Thank you for being here and I will not drink with you today.
