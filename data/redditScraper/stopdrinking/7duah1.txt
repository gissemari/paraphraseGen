A few weeks ago we got the invitation to a party tonight. There will be booze...Around the time of the invite I tried to get straight after a week of light but continuous relapse. I had a discussion with some wise friends here about wether or not to reset the badge. I did somewhat grumpily. Just some days ago I realised why I didn t want to reset...I was subconsciously planning a relapse tonight...I m happy to say now I m not...I played the tape forward. I got thoughts and fears out into the light. I forced myself to offer to drive (driving sober is holy for me) - that alone took off some pressure. I ve got NA quality beer. We ve got a delicious dish to bring. I m intent on keeping my badge untouched as a ...saint - uhm yeah well anyhoo we re off to the party later this evening and to all you beautiful wonderful excellent awesome people at SD..I will not drink with you today!

Fantastic! Enjoy yourself
Great strategies! Playing the tape forward always works for me... I'm glad this thought process is automatic for me now. And I do like my quality NA beer :)
Stay Saintly   remember how good that part 2 of your NDV will feel later.  Have a great time!  
Hey Saint sending you good strong positive vibes from West Aus! You've got this my friend :) *Oh &amp; try to have a little bit of fun too lol*..I won't be drinking with you!
I love your honesty.
