Starting over again. I thought I could moderate. Boy was I wrong
----------immediate responses--------

i was off it for 1.5 years and thought i could moderate it and "start over" - slippery slope and back to bad habbits. stopped again... turns out i cant do moderation and need to accept that
Hey glad you're here!  Some go out and don't make it back.  ..You've conducted some important research.  I (and possibly) others could benefit from your hard work.  If you're willing (1) what will you do differently now based on what you learned?; and (2) what would you offer others who are in the first few days weeks or months?..Today I forgo just ONE drink - The First One..
I believe if we could moderate we would have all along in some form. I also believe moderation is not learned it's just something people who are not alcoholics can just do with zero effort. Glad you made it back. 
I hope never to try to disprove your theory.  I carry around a mental record of how desperately ill I felt/was on 1st January 2017 and if I ever think I can moderate..........I will happily not moderate my consumption of H2O with you today..
