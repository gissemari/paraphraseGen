My mom is an active alcoholic she drinks heavily pretty much everyday. I have addiction problems too just not with alcohol so I understand her struggles. It's just so disappointing. I see her do well for so long and then she just spirals downwards...&amp;#x200B;..She gets so depressed sometimes that she has tried to kill herself in the past. I don't want drinking to be the death of my mom. I know that there's nothing I can do unless she wants to get help and that really kills me sometimes I think about her often. I just want my mom to be happy and healthy I love her a lot. ..&amp;#x200B;..I don't know what to do anymore my mental health has been deteriorating because of this and just because of addiction and depression in general. Any advice sympathy anything is welcome.

It's really hard to feel so powerless. My dad had a heart attack yesterday and he refuses to believe that his alcohol addiction has anything to do with it. He has been drinking heavily for a few years now (5+ drinks every single day)...It's really hard for me because I can't do or say anything that will improve that side of his life. He chooses to believe that it's okay to get shitfaced every day so long as he's not overweight...I feel like it's a turning point in my life. Like suddenly I am responsible for my father's poor decisions. Like I need to be the adult and parent in this situation. But I know that all I can do is get this crap out of my life set a better example for my kids and try to help realize that he has a major problem. It's very strange being more responsible than your parent and I am not sure how to cope with it yet myself. A heart attack at 60 is not something I can ever look forward to.
Hi. Unfortunately we aren't really the best sub to offer you support. You might want to reach out to r/AlAnon. It's a group of people who love an alcoholic but do not want the other person's drinking to negatively affect their lives. Or if 12-step isn't your bag you might try r/scienceandkindness. It's another great sub for loved ones dealing with someone else's addiction issues where they focus on the [CRAFT]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_reinforcement_approach_and_family_training) method.
