I havent haven't had a drink in almost week and I feel like it is a huge accomplishment but my life around me makes me want to pick up a beer again and the struggle is strong.

Glad you reached out to us. Is there an activity you can do that will help you cope with the issues in your life like exercise reading or anything you enjoy doing that will break that destructive cycle?.
I had that same struggle at a day. 1 week. 30 days. 5 months. Now I'm back with some baby steps. Hopefully you can stay strong through the struggle and congrats on the week!

Welcome to SD. I know how that feels to want to celebrate but have some shit happening that makes you want to drink. My first week sober I was going through the process of shutting down my company that I had built from the ground up. It was rough. But with the help and support of people here on SD I was able to get through it. ..That's awesome that you're almost at a week! Do you have any plans for how you're going to keep it up?
Way to go :) you posted rather than picking up.
