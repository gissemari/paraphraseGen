I'm a long time lurker and first time poster to Stopdrinking & Reddit in general.  I'm emotionally exhausted so I'm turning to the internet for my therapy.  I know the index said this isn't the best place to post for advice but I don't know where else to go.  I'll try to keep this post as brief as possible but the full story deserves to be told.  This story is about my alcoholic older brother who also has stage 4 kidney cancer.  For this story we will call him Patrick....**The Set Up**.I am the youngest brother of four with my oldest brother fourteen years my senior.  Earlier this year Patrick got divorced was fired from his job and was diagnosed with cancer.  In August he finally admitted he was an alcoholic and I took him to detox.  Since then he has battled with the news of cancer and being a verbally abusive and angry alcoholic.  ..**The Story**.During his first night of detox he had trouble breathing and was transferred to the main campus of the hospital.  Some scans were done which identified a large tumor on the kidney and other concerning masses on his lungs and lymph nodes.  Biopsy results came back as Stage 4 Renal (Kidney) and cancerous tumors in his lungs.  The plan was to get sober get on chemo change his diet and get healthy.  ..Immediately following the diagnosis I stepped down from my role at work and moved in with him to take care of his house do the cooking and just be there for overall support.  He was sober during the week and in good spirits but relapsed on the weekend.  He snuck alcohol into the house and slammed a drink in front of me.  He started slurring his words and the all-too-familiar glazed angry look came back to his face like an old friend.  He passed out and I packed up my stuff and moved back home.  ..My parents were up next.  They both cut their work schedules back so they could split the week at his house.  My mom stayed there for four nights and my dad for three.  Patrick continued to relapse multiple times under my parents' watch.  However my dad was steadfast and did not give up hope.  He kept fighting with my brother to get him sober and get him back on his chemo regimen.  He had stopped taking his medication to drink alcohol.  (Alcohol consumption mixed with this type of chemo creates a very poisonous mix.)  For two months Patrick went back and forth between relapsing and getting sober enough to get back on his medication.  His periods of sobriety shifted from lasting weeks to sometimes only days...In November our other brother decided it was his time to save the day.  He and his wife uprooted from Sri Lanka to move in with Patrick and get him back on track.  We will refer to this brother as Andrew.  Andrew is a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and is well versed in all practices of Eastern influence.  They started Patrick on a holistic protocol which has actually yielded amazing results which his doctors can't even explain.  At this point my fears were diminished because I knew Andrew could fix all of this.  Andrew and Patrick are much closer in age and have a much stronger relationship with each other than with me.  Patrick is a very proud and stubborn older brother who has always had all the answers.  Andrew is his confidant and is the only person who Patrick will open up to.  Andrew is also an alcoholic who is battling his own demons.  But Andrew was the answer that Patrick needed...Patrick relapsed on Thanksgiving which put him back into the hospital.  He needed to be on heavy oxygen and was in the worst state yet.  We were shown the scans of his lungs from August and that week.  It was like shrapnel went off and the tumors spread out covering 70% of his lungs.  We found out that news a few days later on his 40th birthday.  The doctor recommended that we meet with the palliative care team the next day to talk about what to do next.  The palliative care team is essentially a team of doctors that are meant to help with end of life care.  It means they've pretty much given up hope on their end.  We came back to the hospital the following day and sat with my brother in his room.  The news consisted of only negative responses.  One doctor said Patrick may need to be on oxygen for the rest of his life.  Another doctor said that they couldn't resume the chemo treatment until his lungs were better which looked doubtful that they would improve.  But the news that got us all was that he may only have a few weeks to live.  After a few hours of crying and frustration Patrick was determined to do anything he could to stay alive.  His main motivation stemmed from thinking about his two children ages six and eleven.  He was going to get sober and get healthy this time!..Patrick gets out of the hospital and gets sober.  The doctors were extremely impressed with how quickly he recovered and things started to look up for him.  A few days later Patrick hosts a sober Christmas party for our family and relapses after everyone had left.  He has been drinking for a few days now and it's killing us all.  I just left his house and got pulled over on the way home.  A perfect ending to a perfectly crappy day...**The Emotions**.I had dinner there tonight with Andrew and his wife and Patrick went to the bar.  I am in shock.  We are all just in shock about the entire situation.  This man has been given so much support and love from his family and friends but he chooses to go down a path of death and destruction.  He has been told multiple times that each drink he takes perpetuates the growth of his cancer.  He is literally speeding up the death process by adding the worst substance he can to his body.  This whole situation has been a roller coaster of emotions.  I am so utterly angry and depressed at the same time.  How can someone choose to die?  Why do we want him to live but he doesn't?  It is an entirely selfish act on his end because he knows exactly what he is doing.  He is choosing to throw what hope he has left right out the window.  I mean Andrew gave up his whole life to come and fix him!  What the fuck!  What a fucking asshole.  Someone does that for you and you choose to throw away all the fucking progress that you've made?  You selfish piece of shit.  ..As his sibling it is very hard for me to not be angry with him.  I know that alcoholism is a disease in itself and has nothing to do with willpower.  But I look at how much destruction it has caused for my entire family and I can't help to want to punch him right in the face.  I've screamed at him cried with him laughed with him motivated him tried to inspire him.  But the only thing I can do now is to worry about making me happy and give support when I can.  Alcohol is killing my brother and my brother is killing me...Some days are better than others but I'm almost just waiting for this thing to be over.  Part of me wants him to live and the other part of me just wishes he would hurry up and die.  It's so messed up to say that but it's so draining to watch and be a part of.  When he's sober he is an amazing guy who gives up so much of his energy for other people.  But when he's drunk he is an angry and loud person who says the worst things.  I get anxiety just being around him.  I don't know what to do I don't know how to feel I don't know who to talk to.  I am extremely defeated and feel so utterly alone in all of this.  The world is a screwed up place and this situation is the epitome of pure evil.  ..**The Request**.1.) For those of you who choose to read this story I ask for any and all comments or questions or advice you have.  I haven't told many people about this story simply because it's exhausting to think about.  My whole world has been turned upside down these past few months and I don't know what's right anymore.  If you have anything to say about this I'm all ears...2.) I have watched alcohol literally ruin my brother's life.  I thought that it would be an easy thing for him to give up.  The answer was simple: stop drinking and you beat cancer and you live.  Easy as pie!  Super simple right?  Wrong.  He has lost his willpower and his determination to fight this disease because of alcohol.  To be honest he is emotionally fucking all of us up right now.  My family is fucking devastated because no one knows why he chooses to die instead of live.  For those of you who also struggle with this goddamn disease I'm sorry.  I don't know if I'll ever understand but maybe this story will give you some sort of inspiration.  When you have a craving or are feeling in a rough spot remember that every drink you take not only affects you but those who love you.  The ripple effect is enormous and can have such a huge impact on so many people.  There's so much more to life than that stupid bottle on the counter.  It hasn't brought any good to my brother's life or to my family's.  For us family members and friends of those who struggle please choose to live.  Please....**TL;DR**.Oldest brother is a stage 4 cancer patient who is also an alcoholic.  He chooses to drink and kill himself while our family tries to convince him to live.  I'm the very angry younger brother that doesn't understand why.  ....

Wow. What a journey your family has been on. My deepest sympathies go out to you all. Im in recovery and am also a live in caretaker for my mother who has stage four as well. I really wish the best for all of you and can't imagine addiction coupled with cancer. Both are terrible. ..I really wish I had advice for you. My best suggestion to you is to try AlAnon. Its a group for loved ones and family members of addicts. They have a subreddit as well. I went to AlAnon meetings for years and they really helped me sort through my emotions about the addicts in my life. I also got tools for my own recovery. Maybe the most important thing is that because I learned more about addiction there I was a better support system for the addicts in my life...Wishing you all the best possible outcome and if you don't get that I wish you peace and strength during this battle. ((Hugs)) 
Hello u/weebales - Welcome.  Normally I start with  Glad you're here  for a new poster.  I'll eschew that greeting.  I'm not *glad* you're here because of what brought you here:  he chooses to die instead of live ...My brother made that exact choice 10 months ago.  He had a family that loved him and misses him now.  He chose to exit by putting gun to his head.  Here's his story at this link [Buried my Brother]( https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/46kenl/buried_my_brother_please_reach_out_to_loved_ones/).  ..You close your post with:..&gt; I'm the very angry younger brother that doesn't understand why...I mean this with compassion: *Why* is *overrated*. ..In effect I along with my brother's wife children family co-workers community   they all said  why did this happen?   We all seek the answer to   .. Why is this happening*? ..We should instead focus on  **What** is happening?; and *How do* **I** *choose to be with it?* ..  Why  doesn't matter.   What  is all that matters.  In this case  what  is as you wrote    he chooses to die instead of live .  I can't change that.  You can't change that.  His family can't change that.  His children can't change that.  And you know what?  Yeah I'm sad but I'm also ANGRY!  It's OK to be angry....I do have compassion for you for your family for the sadness the confusion and the utter chaos that one person can wreak on a family through their self-centered self-indulgent selfish nature...You write:.&gt;This man has been given so much support and love from his family and friends but he chooses to go down a path of death and destruction..Yes.  My brother was *self-centered*; he was *self-indulgent*; and ultimately he was *selfish*.  Don't get me wrong.  I love my brother and miss him.  ..Ultimately:  *He would not accept any help to get better and that's his choice*.  Doesn't matter  Why  it only matters  What  he chose.  I can provide all kinds of speculation about  why    he was too proud; he was ashamed that his willpower wasn't enough; he was unwilling to ask for help; by choosing death he thinks he has a modicum of control treatment and help are uncertain death is certain.  I have other speculation that is related to what you wrote:..&gt;He is a  verbally abusive and angry alcoholic. ..My brother was Angry.  He was however  quietly angry .  He was angry with a lot of things.  Life hadn't turned out the way he wanted.  His other brothers were  more successful' whatever that means.  His career was dormant.  There's a whole laundry list of  whys  and they don't mean shit.  Why doesn't matter.  What is all that matters...You write:..&gt;Why do we want him to live but he doesn't? It is an entirely selfish act on his end because he knows exactly what he is doing. He is choosing to throw what hope he has left right out the window. ..Sorry but Yes.  He's selfish and self-indulgent.  You also share:..&gt;As his sibling it is very hard for me to not be angry with him...Yep.  I'm angry with my dead brother.  He stole from his family.  He stole from his children and his wife.  Here's my post 3 months after his death when he missed his daughter's graduation at this link [Reflections on Being a Thief]( https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/4krr4f/brother_killed_himself_reflections_on_being_a/.).  ..As you write:..&gt;To be honest he is emotionally fucking all of us up right now. My family is fucking devastated because no one knows why he chooses to die instead of live...Yep.  And I'm truly sorry to hear that...You know what?  It's OK to be angry; to feel the conflict of emotions; the roller-coaster; the extreme moods of anger apathy hate and yes even  go ahead and get this done'.  At least my brother went quickly...I'm not cold hearted.  I miss my brother every day.  I get to be there for his children.  But I can never replace the  father  the  husband  that he stole from his family...Here's what I know.  Your brother is struggling.  He is **not doing what you want him to do**.  The opportunity here is to move from asking  Why  and instead focus on  What .  It sounds like the  what  is as  you wrote:   he chooses to die instead of live ...That's his choice.  I may not like it.  All I am required to do for my peace of mind is Accept it.  The struggle the contention is  it's not like I want it to be .  If I give up on  wanting it to be the way I think it should be  then I can be of use to my brother...I can say  I love you.   I can say  I'm going to miss you .  I can say  I'm sad and I wish it were different but I accept that this is how you want it .  I can say  This is so painful for me right now that I must distance myself from you for my own health and well being .  I can say  I have a space reserved just for you Brother.    It's here whenever you choose to step into that loving space.    I have a hand of helping stretched out to you.  It's available whenever you want to grasp it.    It's your choice Brother. ..Then when I do that I'm better.  I'm better for everybody including the rest of my family...Sorry about your situation.  It's a bitch...Today I forgo just ONE drink   The First One.
