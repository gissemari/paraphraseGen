I know many have had them but I think this was my first.  I was at a past dream job and constantly sneaking outside to get a drink in my car.  I had made amends with my family we got along great the job was perfect and fit my family lifestyle so on and so forth.  I guess I was caught in the dream as I was let go and kicked to the curb.  How do I explain this to my family after all I'd put them through and rebuilt already?  There's no way I can cover this up.  What the hell do I do?  This is my final fuck up and I have no way out...Long story short I wake up at 3am in a near panic and try to brush it aside but here I am in SD.  Thank goodness it was only a dream as it scared the piss out of me...Everything is good these days at least.  Thanks for reading.

I still get drinking dreams. I always tell myself it's better to relapse in a dream than in real life!
