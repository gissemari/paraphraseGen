It was the first real panic attack I've had in quite awhile...I've had them ever since I can remember but it took me a long time to label them correctly. I just didn't know what they were but they were terrifying. Debilitating. They lead me to seek help for mental health issues...More than a decade later I still struggle mightily with depression and anxiety. Those helped me fall to substance abuse as self medication. ..But this panic attack was different. I managed somehow to cut through it and use it as motivation instead of just trying to survive it. I have a set of processes I normally run through to try to ward off an attack...or worst case scenario an idea of a safe place to go and be alone until it passes...But this time I dove in to it. Headfirst. I took it to the extreme. I dared the panic attack to do its worst to me. What could it do? Make everything fall apart? Kill me? Leave me worthless?..All of that has happened a million times over. This journey through abuse and recovery has taught me more about myself and life than just about anything else. You can't kill me panic. I've died over and over and over again. I've dealt with it. It didn't stick. You're going to have to try harder than that to get me from now on...I felt the familiar sensations. I felt the familiar emotions. Fear paranoia panic sense of doom and dread. Impending chaos and punishment in some vague form. Itchy skin racing heart even intense feelings of being persecuted or pursued. Something's coming after me and I can't see the bastard but I know it's there. If you've read the Seventh Son series by Orson Scott Card you might recognize part of the description. The first time I read that it gave me goosebumps. Alvin Maker was catching glimpses of the beast chasing him and it looked just like the one that chases me. Fear loneliness self doubt paranoia. But I just let it visit this time. I saw it recognized it and said "oh hey. you're back again eh?" I managed to somehow aim the crazy manic energy of a panic attack towards useful goals. I think I did more chores last night than I've done in a month combined. ..I'm moving forward. I'm tackling all the shit that's been hanging over my head for years. I'm sober I've survived everything and I have a plan. And it feels really fucking good. ..I'm more myself than I've been in a long long time. And I'm just starting to get to know myself...Happy Monday you all...*edit: and I'm eating warm brownies and ice cream for breakfast because I'm a goddamn adult and I'm in control.
