I've been going to aa and trying to stop drinking for over a year now I've only been partially committed and I know that I wasn't working steps I didn't have a sponsor or much more than a meeting or two a week. ..My girlfriend of almost six years has stuck by my side the entire time before and after but this last relapse has left her broken it's the last chance of many but I know this one isn't the same i just know she is done...Idk what to do but throw myself into the program and really mean it cause at this point words mean little. I don't want anything more than to work the steps and remain sober but it's a story heard time and time again...It's my first post her and idk what kind of help or support I'm asking for but anything is appreciated

Glad you're here...&gt;Idk what to do but throw myself into the program and really mean it cause at thie point words mean little...Sounds like you're focused!..Words mean little.....  *Actions* carry weight!..If I just "do the program" today I'll have done my best...Then I can choose to do it tomorrow if I want...I did that yesterday and it worked just fine!
To my mind addiction is a very complex problem and requires a holistic multi-pronged approach.....Recovery groups like AA/SMART etc and/or this sub can certainly be an important part of the jigsaw puzzle.....I also took the time to educate myself about the science of addiction in order to understand exactly what I was dealing with.....There are lots of useful resources on YouTube about the [neuroscience of addiction](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=neuroscience+of+addiction) which is really interesting stuff... Dr Robert LeFever and Gabor Mate are also worth a watch.....I also found the book '*Alcohol Explained*' and the book/YouTube '*This Naked Mind*' really helpful for understanding my drinking problem and permanently changing the way I view alcohol - they are well worth a look.....Unravelling any underlying factors such as unresolved emotional trauma with a counsellor or therapist can also help along with properly treating any mental health conditions like depression anxiety ADHD etc.....I also made lifestyle changes such as eating more healthily and getting more active aiming to achieve good overall health and body/brain functioning.....Addictions can also be like a game of whack-a-mole and there is some evidence to suggest that if one continues to use any addictive substance or process (e.g nicotine cannabis caffeine sugar etc) that can increase the likelihood of relapsing back onto the primary Drug Of Choice (alcohol) when the going gets tough so these issues might need to be addressed as well.....Hope that's some food for thought anyway... Best of luck and keep us posted!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
All I can offer is this: your actions mean more to her than any words you could say. I'd suggest .Go to meetings. .Get a sponsor. .Come up with *active* plans to avoid alcohol write them down and involve her in them (if she wants to be involved). ..We're all feeling our way through this one day at a time. .Be kind to yourself and remember that it's all a process. I'll be over here cheering you on. .IWNDWYT .
