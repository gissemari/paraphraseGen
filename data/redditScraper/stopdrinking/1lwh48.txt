I'm 25 y/o male just realizing that I have a real problem. I have lost relationships bc of alcohol but I was always an introvert/stuck in my own world I would put it down to that's just me being me. Now I realize it's the alcohol. ..So I stopped drinking last year (around November I believe). I was a philosophy major in school but I got a good job when I graduated worked and went to school and did well in both and quit my job to continue my studies at the best university in the world for what I want to study. But as I geared up to leave town people at work wanted to take me out to drink etc happy hours etc. I relapsed and got totally drunk ended up doing some dumb stuff...EDIT: The dumb stuff was stupid but it could have been much worse. I got very lucky and it ended up not being too much of a problem. But it was definitely an eye opener.  ..Initially going sober is usually not a problem for me. It is when I make myself 'comfortable' that I try to start having a beer here or there with a friend. This time I'm determined to not slip like that. ..I don't actually like drinking. In fact I hate it. The problem is that I can't say no to the first one and then after the first it's usually down hill. But i've finally realized that this is going to stop. This is usually the issue. I go for weeks even months without drinking and do incredibly productive things and move my life forward. Then I'll drink and get completely shitfaced and ruin relationships. So the problem is is that it is affecting my relationships but not my actual career/life goals (YET) and so it has taken me quite a long time to realize I have a problem.

For me I had to realize and tell myself over and over that saying "yes" to the first one was much worse than saying "no" to the first one. I had a life time of experience to back that up and it was not easy and it still is not easy. But I cannot say "yes" to the first one (I repeat as needed).
What has worked for me has been changing the way I think about alcohol.  When I was drinking I put it up on a pedestal.  It was special and I was special for drinking it...However it's just a beverage.  It's not all that different from say Iced Tea.  I think that in my entire 39.5 years on the planet I've gotten Iced Tea maybe 5 times.  And probably not in 10 years.  It's not that I hate Iced Tea.  I would just prefer something else (lately: water).  Beer is now the same for me.  I just choose not to have that beverage.  It's OK for those around me to order that but I will not...So if my wife and I go out for a romantic dinner (take last night for instance).  If she were to order a glass of wine to celebrate it takes NOTHING away for me to stick with water.  It's still a nice dinner.  She still enjoys her wine.  And most of all she gets to enjoy a predictable wonderful ME.  Turns out last night she did not order wine and we both just drank water.  Interesting that in the old days I would have had wine anyway.....FWIW: The Allen Carr book in the sidebar helped me to start developing my new way to look at alcohol.  I recommend reading it...Good luck.
