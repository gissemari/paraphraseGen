Hi sorry for the long first post. I only just discovered this site today - looking through it looks like a really useful treasure-trove of wisdom and tools to assist in remaining sober. I look forward to being involved...I'm sure like most who post here my drinking has always been different from the norm. I was always noticeably quicker at drinking than my peers but this has got significantly worse as I have gone through my 30's with me drinking more and more on any given drinking session with most sessions ending alone and/or via a blackout. ..3 years ago now I managed to remain sober for 6 months after things had got too much with severe blackouts &amp; reckless drunken behaviour causing massive embarrassment for me and major concern for those around me. I attended AA meetings during that period and was doing absolutely grand there were always the niggling doubts though. I convinced myself that I could drink again and this time it would be different (something many people warned me about but my pig-headedness prevailed). For the first few months I was fairly sensible and my drinking remained comfortably within the realms of what is considered (in the U.K. at least) to be socially acceptable. ..Over the last year it has progressively got worse and again found myself blacking out with increasing regularity culminating in me being told I was inappropriate with a very good friends wife. I have no memory of this and therefore have no context to put this in which makes it really hard to swallow as it is the sort of behaviour which when sober makes me feel very ashamed. ..Anyway I have not now had a drink since Sunday September 30th. I am feeling the health benefits of this but mentally I am struggling with feelings of self-loathing about the crap I have put friends and loved ones through especially as there was absolutely no need for me to pick up that first drink after my 6 months of sobriety. Does anyone have any experience of how to push through these intrusive thoughts of the harm you have caused in the early stages of sobriety? Any help would greatly appreciated.  ..Thanks for reading.

Hey i don't have any advice but I'm starting over and using this site so wanted to say hi. They are nice here. 
Might not be what you're looking for regarding the intrusive thoughts. ..For me I just have to let them happen. I have to let them come to the surface and then say "that's not me anymore" or "I'm not going back to that" or "this is why you stopped drinking" etc..It doesn't make them hurt any less and it doesn't make you feel any less ashamed of yourself... But they come up less and less! Now I just live in the every day and in the coming days...Can't change the past but you *can* make sure it doesn't happen again! ..Hope this helps! iwndwyt
