Hi NMBP.  Sorry to hear about your home group...Triumph: nothing more specific than still sober...Struggle: my running partner is injured.  It's much harder to slog through a long run now that I'm used to having company. We have some upcoming races we were going to do together and I'm not sure if my partner will be able to do them.  Bummed...General chat: fall break coming up.  Can't wait!

Triumph: 10 freaking days. Longest streak in almost three years. Feeling very good about it. Still cautious and trying not to be cocky but there's a calm acceptance about it this time. I don't feel that I'm white knuckling. ..Struggle: Still haven't told any friends/family that I'm trying to get sober. I've just been avoiding them. ..General Chat: I'm going to finally put a dent in this laundry that's been on my floor for weeks and just generally clean up my habitat. 
Boooo drama!..**Triumph**: Well life.  Things are going really well in all phases of life.  I signed up for a "Century Ride" this weekend (100 miles).  I'm really pumped for it...**Struggle**: Nothing bitches!..**General Chat**: The weather in DC is really nice.  It's a little warm and I had already started enjoying wearing long sleeves.  But a few days of short sleeves with mild ~80F temps is good too.
Awesome job getting back into your fitness routine! I found out that I somehow through a loophole have a free gym membership at the school I work for because I'm also taking classes. Now I have no excuses to try to get energized!..Triumph: On my fourth week holy crap! Never thought I'd make it this far so glad I did. Blows my mind how fast the past few weeks have gone by though. Having a counter is really putting things in perspective time-wise for me (even though I do have a calendar I cross days off on every single day but for some reason I don't actually think about time passing). ..Struggle: Getting motivated to have fun. The guy I'm sort of seeing all of a sudden stopped talking to me as much. He's probably just busy but I'm a silly young girl who gets mopey over such things regardless of the reasoning...General chat: So happy the heat has been turned on in the building I work. I was wearing out my little space heater!..
Triumph: Started running again after months of recovering from a foot injury.  This is a huge step towards feeling like myself again...Struggle: Loneliness...General chat: Coffee.
Triumph: 9th day!..Struggle: I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop. I'm worried about some hidden urge out there just waiting to strike me down and bring me back to my old ways. Also I'm not sure how to communicate with my higher power... It always seems like I'm asking him for stuff like strength patience courage etc without giving anything back. I'm not sure how this is supposed to work...General chat: I really need to start exercising again.
First live smart meeting last night...totally works for me.. Just taking things one day at a time
Triumph: I went out of state for a bachelor party all weekend and don't need a badge reset! ..Struggle: it's been awhile. It's a struggle to convince myself that even though my life is 100 times better than it was 6 moths ago all that is only a drink away. ..General: BASEBALL PLAYOFFS!!!!
Triumph:  Finally got over the last slump I was in (lasted about 3 weeks).  Have been branching out and attending different meditation classes which have helped tremendously in keeping me calm/sane.  Generally feeling better FINALLY.  Coping with stress and anxiety without xanax for 10 straight days (longest since I quit)...Struggle:  I still have this insatiable hunger not a huge deal since I'm not overeating as bad as a month ago - at the same time I'm frustrated because I have my half-marathon this weekend and I don't really want to haul extra weight around.  Am also struggling to accept that I'm going to be slower than my last half (coming off a knee injury) because I QUIT smoking and drinking I should be able to FLY!  Calm down just enjoy the race and the after-food!  I just don't listen.  (The breathing exercises have really come in handy when this anxiety hits)...General:  I'm excited about all the food I'm going to eat after the race and my mini beach vacation I'm taking with my sister next weekend (she has been my biggest support).  
Triumph: my three year mark is coming up soon I can't believe it. Sometimes I feel like I am the same person but then I sit back and take a look at myself and really get amazed. (Example: getting an A on my condensed microbiology summer course when I was drinking I would have dropped out after the first week!)..Struggle: Getting out of a three year relationship and back into the dating scene. I feel like a teenager "why hasn't he texted me yet?" I've only been on one date so far taking things superrrr slow so far. But I still struggle with instant gratification. ..Chat: Changing my eating habits slowly and I've been working out for a few months. Starting to see some slow progress. I don't hate going to the gym now it's not my favorite thing to do but I miss it if I have a lazy week. I lost so much weight when I first quit drinking but gained most of it back with my killer sweet tooth.:( now I just moderate what I eat and make better choices. Can't wait for more results!(there's that instant gratification craving again haha) 
Triumph: I think I've built a life I would miss if I went back out. I like my routines now...I realized that Wednesdays are slowly becoming my favorite day of the week because I see my personal trainer therapist and one of the nicer AA groups I've found meets on Weds...Struggle: I found an AA group that I think is very good for my sobriety with lots of old timers so I'm going to pursue that. What I am missing though is friends and social activities. I really miss not having anything to do on the weekends... it's lonely. I'm trying to make it a real focus to discover friendships ..General chat: October is my favorite month. I love the leaves changing and Halloween!
Triumph: I was struggling getting to meetings. Got to my second meeting ever last night. Felt good to share again. Haven't shared my story since I was at in-patient. Hope to keep it up. (Also my Continuing Care counselor will be happy and hopefully get off my back a little)...Struggle: Well getting to meetings. Also dealing with people. I get angry and annoyed easily. I have always been this way and now it's time to work on it...General chat: Got the keys to a new house last night. 5 different keys to 1 house. Front door back door back door deadbolt back of garage front of garage... all different keys. Time for a master key. 
Triumph: 4 days shy of 6 months sober!..Struggle: I really want to throw that 6 months out the window today...my oldest and closest friend died yesterday. This is such a shock to my system that I'm scrambling to hang on with everything that I have. I just got back from the grocery store had all intentions of buying alcohol. Walked out with my diet Coke and some popsicles no booze. Fuck this sucks! ..General Chat: I need a meeting~
(A bit longish since I'm folding my '2 months' post into this one)..**Triumphs**: No day-to-day struggles or urges I couldn't handle/get rid of as they occurred I'm getting better at mental ji-jitsu against myself! This Saturday I'm going to an information session on Spanish language classes in Buenos Aires and I'm starting to plan my holiday in December around that - usually I would have waited way too long and let it slide again. ..Oh and I hit 2 months/9 weeks on Friday/Sunday respectively. One and a half months ago I wouldn't have believed it was possible; now it's the new normal...**Struggles**: Sometimes I worry that this smoothly going period is going to 'have' to end and it takes quite some work for me to realize that *I* have a very big say in that! Sure the days are getting shorter but then I'll just have to make sure I get enough sunlight...The fact that the last two months have gone so well is making me think that I might eventually be able to drink but I did the first weeks on willpower or by external necessity (having to move) and now I'm just coasting on a bit. I'd rather wait to see whether I can get through a more difficult period without alcohol before I declare myself ready to try moderating but I also don't want to induce a difficult period - so that might take a while :-)..Finally I find it difficult to ask for attention (with friends and family) since 'I don't have a problem anymore'. That's bullshit but it's very persistent bullshit...**General**: Yoga is tough (since I haven't done anything constructive with my body for the last 10 years and I have a desk job etcetera) but rewarding still. And I'm going to a nice concert tomorrow (Elephant Stone)!
Triumph: Still staying on my low-carb (/r/keto) diet...Struggle: Kind of stalled in the diet; still haven't really started charting my food and exercise. Need to get back in the habit...General chat: I have had Badfinger's "Baby Blue" running through my head ever since the Breaking Bad finale. 
Home from vacation.  Its great to see family but I am very grateful to be home. Sitting on my couch playing with my cats I'm gonna sleep in my bed tonight...Back to work tomorrow.  Going to be a long day....Not sure how to categorize those statements so I will leave them as is.

Hi!  Triumph: still sober. ..Challenge: sooooooo tired all the time and not sure why.  Getting some medical tests done for that and some other symptoms.  I miss having energy.  I'm feeling annoyed with everyone and everything but I know it's really just the tiredness...General: FOLIAGE bitches!
Triumph:  52 days and counting!  Stress is gradually becoming easier to deal with because my thoughts are clearer.  Remembering problems and thinking about solutions is much more constructive than trying to obliterate the memory of a stressful situation...Struggle: Turning into a bit of a couch potato.  Need to get a fitness routine up and going...General chat: Upgraded the saddle on my bicycle.  What a difference in comfort!  Commutes to work will be much better.
Triumph: 9 months bitches!!!! The last time I went that long had to be when I was 15 or 16............ I'm fifty now........ 51 actually. ..Struggle: time to quit blaming candy and chocolate cravings on alcohol withdrawl. Get on the good sugar train with fruits and veggies. ..General chat: Golf season is almost over time to find something to take my frustration out on instead of a little white ball. .Thanks to everyone here for your stories you help me get through every day!!
