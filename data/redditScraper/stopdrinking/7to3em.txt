Hello everyone :)..Been a great day today I hope you all have had a great sunday too?..So being the one day of the week i dread as its the one i used to abuse the most i have had my first real smooth Sunday with not as much struggle as previously. I cant be more happy about it; that and spending the day doing some assignment work making lunch gaming with a good friend for abit catching up with the new X files and was offered some overtime for a night shift tonight...Im a couple of hours in and no where near as bad as last night so that it is appreciated but not as much as not drinking today...Tonic water and a bag of buttons and set for the rest of the night :)...Have a great evening and good night :).
