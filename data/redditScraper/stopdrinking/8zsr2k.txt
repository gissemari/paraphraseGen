Fuck... I read all the stories and looked at the progress pics... I went through two rounds of out-patient rehab AA one on one addiction counseling. I in a last half ditch effort to see the light browse this sub where realistically i'm not sure I have any business being. ..I did everything but I kept drinking. It's internally ruined my life left me powerless emotionally physically exhausted nothing less of an unconscious blob on the bathroom floor of a bar. But in some genetic fluke of my existence there has never been any real external consequences for my actions  (this was super helpful during my denial phase). I managed to destroy myself from the inside I have never gotten a DUI been reprimanded for drinking at work. I've been blessed with a pretty amazing support system I cant even count the times my fiance picked me up and put me to bed.  Despite the fact that there are many many people in my life who should have walked away I've never lost a friend as a result of my addiction. ..Part of me sometimes thinks that maybe if I'd lost something other than my mind i might have had a reason to get sober or be sober. but on to that...I am sober. Fuck it sucks. Its been two months Its not always bright sunshine and rainbows I do wish it was sometimes its a day that Dante could deem the third not totally painful but mildly annoying circle of hell... I survived You'll survive..But the reality is you're going to have shitty days. Your going to be inconvenienced butted in front of in the coffee line someone will cut you of in traffic someone will yell at you because being loud makes them feel powerful. There are going to be a million and one reasons for you to drink. Theres a million and one for me to drink but regardless of the struggle alcohol isn't going to make it better and I would rather face this bullshit sober with you. IWNDWYT. even if the bad days are bad despite your best efforts.

On the bad days I like listening to "Instuctions for a Bad Day" by Shane Zoyczan. Sometimes I have to own up and admit I need some advise from someone other than me. For me being sober is really difficult there are still many people in my life who idolize how I drank and would aspire for it but I truly believe you. If you can survive i can too. Yes we will be sober yes tomorrow will be better and yes we will look back and know those dark days are behind us. My best wishes.
