Pardon me admins if this kind of post isn't allowed and take it down. BUT it's interesting and heartening going through my first few months of recovery and watching the newest season of this show Shameless the US version. This newest season has a very heavy plotline based around a few different alcoholics in many different stages one newly in recovery one battling years of alcoholism and someone going through a relapse...I personally find it very heartening and have so far laughed and cried and related in the shame and blatant honesty it has been showing about the truths about alcoholism that I have never before seen portrayed so well on a TV show.

Is the show  shameless ?
Shameless is one of my all time favorite shows! I love the way Shameless portrays addiction. It shows all sides good bad and uglier than ugly! It's very real and also ridiculous enough to be entertaining. Other shows that are very good at bringing more awareness to addiction are Nurse Jackie and Love. 
I love Shameless x
Show is crazy    I think it's great!
