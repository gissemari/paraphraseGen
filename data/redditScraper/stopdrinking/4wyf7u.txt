I subscribed to this sub so that it would show up when my hubby looks at reddit back when he was having some issues (so it could help him with his drinking by showing him other people have succeeded). Now that I've been reading the posts  I've been wondering about myself. ...I grew up in a family that doesn't drink and they side-eye people who drink more than one drink at dinner. My husband's family is the exact opposite - multiple DUIs normal to drop Bailey's in your coffee in the morning  9 drinks from 5pm on isn't even blinked at....My husband is somewhere in the recovering spectrum - he now has one or two beers every few weeks and occasionally goes months sober because he feels he needs to. ...For a few years he really struggled with alcohol and I've spent years by his side supporting him and picking him up when he falls down. So I don't know if that experience is making me cautious with how I drink. ..I drove him for a year after he lost his license after getting an OUI. When I was pregnant  I obviously didn't drink.  So because of those two things  when we're with friends my hubby encourages me to drink and have fun as he has decided he's permanently my ride home...Here's where I stand - I rarely drink but when I do  it's multiple days in a row (maybe 4 days) one or two solo cups of wine.  I try to not drink if I'm stressed and I like drinking socially with my mom friends.  I DO look forward to some wine. I recently made a mistake and made a 30 second drive when I should have taken a cab after being on a rare outing with non-mom friends.  I feel like I go a little over board on my nights out specifically because as a parent I get about 3 of them a year. My hubby encourages me to live it up on my girl's nights because he feels I deserve it and I never get them. ..I haven't had any alcohol in a few days (and before that hadn't had any in maybe a month).  I rarely crave it  but I really really enjoy it when I drink it and if I'm drinking  it's specifically to get a little buzz...So my issue is I feel guilty when I look forward to drinking some wine. I look forward to ordering a drink with dinner. It feels taboo because of how I was raised...So am I feeling guilty because my family is two different extremes? I feel like  based on my hubby's family  if I look forward to a drink I'm worried I'm too close to moving towards the alcoholic side of the spectrum. My parents get concerned if you have a second beer.  ..So after this wall of useless text: I have a "Mom cave." It has wine in it. I felt guilt when I bought an "All you need is love and wine" sign because I wondered for a moment if it made me an alcoholic for liking wine and liking the sign. I look forward to drinking a few glasses once every few weeks. I enjoy drinking it and never get drunk with the exception of going out with my friends that one night. Is this a guilty pleasure that I'm okay doing? I had no problem not drinking in the 3 months before I got pregnant or while I was pregnant. My family makes me feel that if I say "I would kill to have a glass of wine right now " then it's a problem.  But I also say that about chocolate  and it's just as rare that I consume that. Or is there a problem and do I need to throw all the alcohol out?

Shame is one of the most useless feelings and we *choose* to feel it!! Done is done yet we continue to beat ourselves up over it! Do you feel guilt for simply drinking for the amount you drink or for the things you do when you drink? Instead of embracing the guilt examine the behavior and decide if it's behavior you can accept...We all have "that one night" ... it's the patterns of multiple nights/weeks/months/years like "that one night" that indicate a problem...Your post makes me think that either a) you're projecting guilt onto yourself based on someone else's behavior or b) you exert some other behavior when drinking that you're not writing about... I could be completely wrong probably am but that's my $0.02...So to cut it short... what is the problem? Try to sum it up in one or two sentences.
Are you guilty about having time to yourself or about your drinking?..It sounds like you're trying to be perfect. Why not just do what makes you happy?
