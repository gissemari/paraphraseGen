As the title shows I am on Day 1 of SD. Long time lurker but have never posted...I tried AA a few years ago (wasn't for me) and have read almost any book I can find to get over my drinking problem...I've come to accept that I cannot do this on my own so I'd like to join the community here. ..For those that have found success in sobriety I'd like to say THANK YOU for sharing your stories they really help the newbs like me and for those that are struggling so am I and I wish you the best...I will not drink today.
