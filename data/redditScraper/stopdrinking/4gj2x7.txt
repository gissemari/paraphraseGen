My mom is an alcoholic and has been clean for about 6 months.  Last night she went missing and came home in the wee hours of the night without her car.  I can't prove anything but I'm assuming she went to a bar and ubered home.  She's still sleeping and I've yet to approach her.  I'd like to say something but don't want to upset her or worsen the situation.  Any advice from someone who may have been in her situation at one point? If this isn't the right place to post could someone please point me in the right direction?

Don't say anything let her tell you when she's comfortable. Get a pot of coffee going or some tea. Maybe make some breakfast and if she's up in time offer her some. Tell her you love her.  .  .You're not going to do any good by confronting her. If she's gone 6 months sober and relapsed odds are she's already upset enough about it on her own. She might need a few days before she's comfortable talking about it. She might not bring it up for quite a while. The bottom line is that you need to remember you can't control her drinking it's up to her. All you can do is support her let her know you love her and let her control her recovery.  .  .Best of luck to you!
