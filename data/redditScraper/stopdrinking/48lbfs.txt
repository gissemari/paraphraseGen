Of course a common problem for alcoholics is: relapse > IMO the actual [past] relapse is NOT as important as WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO ABOUT IT? Most of us are going to feel the obvious: disappointed/frustrated/angry + a pile of mess [from the drunken aftermath] to deal with ... maybe too much   spent/annoying people/phoning people at 3am/arguing etc. I used to REALLY get guilty and beat myself up over this=which made things worse. I understood [over the many years] you've got to get SELFISH think of number1; how you're going to tackle this mess and get sober the easiset way with the least pressure and guilt. So I kinda used [bury] my head in the sand and forget ALL my wrongdoings and focus on how ME is going to clear this mess up. After all If i got negative and gave up...I'm gonna continue making my life and other around me unpleasant. I'm not condoning selfishness just trying to prioritise sobriety...then after ten or so days when feeling emotionally physically and psychologically better then apologise to the relevant people. By having this [part] deluded attitude created positivity to just scrape myself off the canvas and START again. Over the many years close drinking associates who still continue to drink I have had to severe ties with because it weren't good for me and caused relapses. These are people who have no intention of giving up but still complain about their woes that drinking has caused. I only remain in contact with ONE person who regularly relapses. The sole reason I do is: he always shows HEART and wants to quit. So far he's made 3 or so months before sober....but because of his heart and fighting spirit I still admire him. He doesn't complain about his woes unlike the others mentioned and just gets on with getting sober. It may take him time but with that attitude he'll eventually get there. Being sober FOR TODAY and having HEART and will are most important in this game. Don't matter if you're sober for 25 years or 25 hours ... if you have HEART and WILL and are sober FOR TODAY you've been as strong as the next sober man/woman.
