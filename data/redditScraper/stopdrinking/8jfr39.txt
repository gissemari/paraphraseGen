I swear I hate this feeling. Just finished a long bender &amp; I can barely sit here without wanting to keel over I can't move too quickly or I'll get nauseous and I can't even eat. ..I go through stretches of sobriety and I love my life.  I've struggled with being  an alcoholic  and it's hindered my recovery. Living doesn't need to be this difficult...IWNDWYT   ..

Welcome home
Welcome back.  Wishing you the best.
I feel for you brutal hangovers are the worst. I remember those times as motivation to stay away from liquor.
I'm back to day 1 as well. Felt like crap all day and my anxiety was through the roof. IWNDWYT
