Still struggling with night binge eating and more and more poker.  I'm grateful that neither has the destructive pace of alcohol (yet) but I see where this is heading. How do you fill the restless void without something that engages those same well-trodden neural pathways that were blazed by booze?

When I quit drinking I was also addicted to sex/porn gambling cigarettes.  Through the recovery process I was able to very quickly quit all of those.  I now no longer need to fill a "restless void" as there are no restless voids.  Before I could get here however I needed to work hard through the recovery process.  I still need to stay vigilant today...Good luck!

Six years. I struggle with other issues but I'm not controlled by them in the way an addiction controls you. It is a bit like whack a mole but the moles eventually come just above the surface and go back in the hole after a short time.
