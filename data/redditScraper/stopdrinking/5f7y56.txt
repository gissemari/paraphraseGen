Made it to 50 something before stumbling.  Made it through Thanksgiving and even went to the hometown bar with some family members.  Wasn't even really tempted.  I'd say I'm at 5 months with 5-6 days of drinking in there.  It's amazing how much my perspective has changed.  It doesn't feel like a struggle that much any more.  I hope that keeps up.  ..So hang in there everyone. It gets better.

Woot! One month!..[happy dance because too many deserts of late to celebrate with ice cream]
I don't know how those days stacked up together or they were all one off events but I'm at about 1 1/2 years with probably 20ish days of drinking. I did 8 months the first time then another 3 before I found this group. Most of that 20 is 2 days in a row and one very boozy 3 day wedding event at the beginning of this month back home out east so I'd say 10ish "episodes" since I stopped. I wouldn't have this kind of control of I hadn't had a few long stints of sobriety to refocus on myself my relationship and my career. And I'm in such a completely different place than I was then but the same challenges still occur. I know I'm one of the rare ones who can pick it up and put it down being a chef I have some super tough shifts (like a 15 hour thanksgiving shift though I didn't drink Thursday) that afterward I just want a drink or 5 and I've been able this past 8 months to leave it as a one off and go long stretches without. Mostly what I'm getting at is that you shouldn't beat yourself up about those few instances of drinking not all of us are here to never drink again but to re-evaluate our relationship with drinking and to learn how to function as adults in this world without the daily and destructive behavior we let become the norms. But sometimes adults drink and that's okay even excessively if contained and safely but being able to section off that kind of thing is difficult and everyone can just "flip that switch" and hop back off the alcohol train. I don't know your story but thats a very small snapshot of mine. I think this is an important subset of this group  of people looking to realign their lives and move away from their behavior and thus is an opinion that doesn't get enough discussion. ..Edit-i probably will stop drinking forever when my first kid is born but thats still a few years out. I also don't consider this moderation because when I do drink now I still drink like I used to it's just for a night or two then it's out of my system. I have zero intention of becoming a daily or even monthly drinker again but the way I manage it is not by moderating.
