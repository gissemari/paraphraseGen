After (yet another) relapse I've decided it's time to swallow my pride and ask my Dr for anabuse.  My ego tells me that it's cheating and a failure to ask for this but my ego also sometimes tells me that this time I can control my drinking... my ego doesn't know anything...On another note.  I had heard it's alot easier to stay siber than get sober and I can now 100% confirm that to be true.  I was chugging along and had 9 months and was feeling great and lately I've barely been able to make it a week.

Welcome back.  Humility can be a strength and if it gets you where you want to be in sobriety then that is amazing.
&gt; my ego doesn't know anything...Good for you for not listening to it! If there's a shot that antabuse could help and you've got the means to try it then good golly try it. I hope it helps! ..
Not a failure! Brave and tough! It's brave and strong and wise to use all the tools available to try to crack the case. You're fighting and working and doing uncomfortable things for the right reasons--you are *willing* and nothing matters more. I see no failure here. There is only wisdom and humility tougher than pride. IWNDWYT.
