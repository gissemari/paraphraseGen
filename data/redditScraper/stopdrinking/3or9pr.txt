I decided to actively participate in this sub instead of lurking. Figured it could help to give me the strength to continue this time. I suffer from social anxiety so I haven't been able to gather up the courage to make it to an AA meeting yet. I know this post isn't much but I figured I'd get the momentum going in case I'm struggling and really need to reach out...Phew! This is actually a big step for me reaching out. I don't have anyone that I can burden this with or that I think would give me the kind of advice or support that I need. So thanks compadres. I wish you and myself strength on this journey!.

Welcome.  You're among friends here.  Good on you for doing a difficult thing.
HI! I understand! I'm almost close to 48 hours sober now. I started drinking years ago from social anxiety. I actually posted about being nervous to go to AA yesterday afternoon and there were some really great responses (post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3olpce/afraid_to_go_to_aahorrible_anxiety/) ..Lots of great advice but what I ended up doing was calling the group I wanted to go to explaining my fears (didn't want to have to talk didn't want people approaching me etc) and asked if they could provide someone to meet me a little bit beforehand and then take me with them into the meeting. It made A WORLD of difference. Yes it was still really scary and nervous but I had someone there as a buffer even if I only met her an hour before. And I didn't have to talk at all and wasn't made to feel weird about being silent. ..I'm happy you're here. 
Welcome!
Welcome former lurker!! :)) This sub is an EXCELLENT tool for getting sober. AA is good too but if all you're doing is coming here that is a great start. For me the longer I was sober the more my social anxiety started to go away. Not saying that happens to everyone but it might happen to you too. Stay strong and congrats on taking this huge step!!
Thanks for saying hi!  Nice to meetcha.  :-)
Hey - welcome to you. You bet it is a big step. I don't remember posting or even aligning words correctly when I was 5 days in. Stay on board and I am sure you will find help and support around this sub. You will probably find that social anxiety is a topic that comes around in different shapes &amp; forms across posts. It is a condition that many have faced at some point. It is possible to overcome this.
Welocme /u/WhoAmISober to /r/stopdrinking -- great username.  At 6 years sober (and almost 30 years in and out of AA) I'm still in the process of finding this out.  I will tell you this: it's worth it!  So at this [link you will find a post known locally as the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is not a half-bad place to start stopping.  Good luck to you.
Congratulations on 4 days! One day at a time my friend.
A start is a start. Welcome! 
The first couple of weeks without alcohol were so difficult. I allowed myself to just lay around and drink tea and eat snacks and watch crap tv I could hardly do anything else. It's one step at a time reaching out was a huge one. Nicely done. 
Yew! Day 5 the first time for me I was too insane to function so kudos. You should feel out of whack right now you're depriving your body and mind of its favorite solution to all of your problems and it's scrambling to recover. It gets so much better...Meetings are tits for a social butterfly like me because I need people energy. Sometimes I get over energized too so I go to smaller meetings and calmer meetings when I need to. I think a trick to find a smaller meeting is the "off" times like a 3 or 4 pm weekday meeting or maybe an early early one that's not at an Alano club or recovery center. There are men's and women's stags also which can feel calmer. If it would help to have a companion call your local general service office and they can send someone out to chill with you. If someone asks you to talk just say pass. Reaching out to newcomers is my best method of staying sober but I'm never offended when they close me out cut me off or straight up run away if they don't want to talk to me. I just hope they come back :) Good luck!
