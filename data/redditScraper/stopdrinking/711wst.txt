Hello everyone.  ..Long time lurker hoping to contribute a little...I want to write about patience...Having stopped drinking for whatever rock bottom or moment of clarity we then- as we sober up- begin to have time to reflect on our situation.  Naturally if we've been numbing/blocking out the world for years we're going to see things we've unhappy with or become aware of things we've left undone; missed opportunities.  A common pattern is...See/think "X" =&gt; feel bad  =&gt;  numb it away with drink..We all know that negative spiral right? ...Of course we're now in the situation of ..See *more* of "X" due to increased clarity =&gt; feel bad =&gt;  really really really want to numb it away....So as we remove our coping mechanism our greater clarity allows our mind to see more things we've been struggling to handle...More pressure combined with the removal of our habitual support...I've been sober a week (wohoo!) and I've been driving myself crazy.  I'm not going to list specifics as you can insert your own but there are sooooo many things I want to do so many things I'm ashamed of not having done- for having wasted DECADES drinking to escape through fear to act or be seen or whatever.  Panic. Shame.  Wanting to hide.  Not wanting that to be the story of me...**That's ok.**..This rushing feeling of awareness of what I've wasted is ok.  I'm awake.  I can act now.  The only thing I have to ensure in order to be moving towards all the other things I want all the unsaid things I wish to say resolving all the outstanding issues and situations is to not drink now.....I will not drink with you today...Good luck.  ..[further reading on patterns](https://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2008/06/feeling-blessed/)......

Great contribution!  Thank you.  
Thank you for posting this! I'm on night three of not being able to sleep because of racing thoughts and regret. These feelings won't kill us but drinking will.
