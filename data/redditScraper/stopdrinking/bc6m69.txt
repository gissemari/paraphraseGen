Two and a half months sober and struggling with ruminating on the past...Just hoping some more experienced people can share some experience/tips for slowing down their thoughts I work long shifts 10/12 hours a day  I'm fine whilst I'm busy and working but as soon as I get home and in the quiet my brain is like a washing machine

Deep breaths. It sounds stupid but it works. ..Sometimes I like yoga after a stressful day.
Mindful colouring;.Reading;.Gym;.Cook something new (you'll have to focus)!.Write down what your racing thoughts are...
I haven't found a solution for it distraction and exercise give me brief respites from it. I think I drank to avoid this part of reality instead I have to learn how to be comfortable with it how to redirect the "washing machine" thoughts in positive directions. I find they're often negative and if I focus on remembering to send them other directions often they stop being so bothersome next time they come around as I just auto-pilot to something more positive.
Running. Weights. Anything to exhaust my mind.
Mindfulness meditation has been shown to shrink the amygdala and reduce anxiety. It has been a total game-changer for me. I meditate for 20 minutes every day.    .    .Yoga is also amazing for boosting mood and decreasing anxiety.
Exercise. Anything to get the blood flowing. I know it's hard to want to do anything after 10-12 hour days but even just a 20-30 minute workout either in the morning or when you get home makes a huge difference in your mood.
