I don't want to be judgmental towards anyone that the program has worked for. I see people in the meetings I've gone to that it clearly DOES work for and a good friend of mine who was an addict turned his life around through AA. More power to anyone that can clean up their act in whatever way works for them!..But every time I go rather than feeling reinvigorated or supported in my quest for sobriety I find myself more depressed and defeated than ever. I read a book recently called "The Easyway to Stop Drinking" by Alan Carr. Although some of his medical advice about withdrawals towards the end of the book is questionable (perhaps he just carried it over from his Easyway to Stop Smoking book) the overall message of the book is something I connected with and illuminated my own issues with AA: whenever I've gone to AA it seems like alcohol is put on this pedestal as this thing that everyone is "powerless over" which sort of implies that they wish they had the willpower most normal drinkers have to be able to take it and leave it. By keeping it in your mind as something you're powerless over you're kind of forever treating it as something you wish you could partake in and that temptation will persist. Indeed by painting non-alcoholics/normal drinkers as people who don't have a character flaw/willpower issue when it comes to drinking it immediately generates some kind of resentment or jealousy. "I wish I could just have two drinks and stop" etc. I'm not saying all people in AA are like this - I think those with enough time under their belt probably realize how much better their lives are and aren't as tempted to relapse? - but in an overall sense I feel like especially newcomers to AA are immediately put in a position where they're going to feel down on themselves and self-defeated. The whole powerless aspect just never sits well with me nor does the religious angle (I understand that it's symbolic and that the Higher Power isn't necessarily God but as an atheist I just struggle with that). What I liked about Carr's book is that he basically breaks it down so that alcohol as a whole is demonized and tries to get you to perceive the "normal" drinkers as people who are just as much caught in a poisonous trap they just haven't fallen as deep down the well yet... so instead of wishing you had their power and beating yourself up mentally over the fact that you can't be a social drinker it sort of switches perspective so that you just see it as something you don't want any part of even if you could...But I don't know. Whenever I have tried AA meetings it just never sits well with me and I leave feeling worse than beforehand. It's usually a very gloomy experience and I hate to jump on a bandwagon but I definitely agree with people who accuse it of having a "cult" mentality (that's partly the religious / Higher Power stuff but also just the whole insular vibe of it all). I end up feeling indoctrinated into something with the language used -- borderline manipulated I guess? ..I am assuming there's probably a lot of people here that AA has worked for and they might take issue with my generalizations. I do not mean any offense. This is just my own subjective experience of going to a few meetings and realizing it just isn't right for me. My question is what are the alternatives for recovery other than reading books like the one I mentioned? It would be great to have a support group and social circle that was a little less...doom and gloom I suppose? (And maybe this is unique to my local AA circle. Who knows. I hope no one is offended by my remarks!)

This sub was my main support in getting sober I like that I could browse at my leisure and find ideas and inspiration it was good to know I wasn't alone in my struggles and goals...I attended SMART Recovery for a while after about 9 months sober. I already knew I aligned with their approach and it was nice to get some face-to-face contact with other people in recovery. My approach is self-empowered and I've found tools and techniques from both SMART and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy to be useful.
I know the feeling. My parents raised us in AA and alanon. (They are both 30+ years sober). I understand that some people find it effective it's just not for me. I've only attended a handful of meetings but I find the environment very depressing. Every one has their own way of dealing with alcohol and the "admitting you're powerless" thing has always turned me off. Here's to not drinking today friend.
I agree with many of your points here. I also hate the cliche that "alcohol is cunning baffling and powerful". Um no it's a substance. One that disagrees with me is all. I go to refuge recovery meetings and I find them much more upbeat. The nice thing is that it is a group for any type of addiction/issue people are dealing with and let's face it most people have an addiction or attachment to something (or someone). If you like the meeting sober people aspect of AA RR might be a good alternative.
Get what your saying I did AA in the beginning after a while it got really tiresome but for the first few months it was really effective for understanding I'm nothing special..It really depends also place to place cause I have been to wonderful meets but also terrifying ones. Anyway follow your heart it is the best thing you can do.
I've never read Carr's book but it sounds interesting.  Another book of note is "This Naked Mind" by Annie Grace.
Life Ring is a group that I go to and have been pretty happy with.  I go to AA groups and I get some of the things you are saying.  The biggest positive takeaway from AA is hearing the other stories and gaining strength in my own recovery from that.  The most difficult in staying sober for me is the feeling of isolation through the process.
I tried AA once and found nothing in it for me. That was my individual experience. ..I thought I would never find a way out of the drinking cycle until I came across the book *The 30 Day Sobriety Solution*. I talk a lot about that book on this sub but I do not have any affiliation with it - other than it may have saved my life when willpower AA and self-loathing couldn't. 
Look man you have had shitty AA meetings that doesn't mean AA is shitty...I'm gonna use an analogy a sponsor gave me when I told him I hated AA meetings..."Chicken fried steak every diner and truck stop in the country has chicken fried steak some make it really well some use shitty meat or the gravy sucks or its over peppered but some places its absolutely amazing.  Now if this is your favorite thing to eat you will try it everywhere you go but when you are near home you know the places that have a good version and you know the places that fuck it up...Why the fuck do you keep going to the places that fuck it up?"..The message was try new meetings find different ones and when you find one whose message really resonates with you keep going to that one.  It took me a long time to find the right meetings but I am a regular fixture at those now.
This group has helped me far more than AA... but AA was VERY helpful for the first few months. After that I just logged in here daily and that has helped so much. I totally understand what you mean. I'm not too into AA because of the religious aspect and because it honestly does feel a little "culty" sometimes. (Also my sponsor situation didn't end up working out and was kind of weird...) Whatever works for you you should do. :) I keep AA in my back pocket for emergencies and I know it's always there should I need it. 
I attended AA meetings for about a month or two but it was ultimately not the right kind of support for me. You are definitely not alone. SD has really been my major source of support but part of my sobriety also meant taking better care of my mental health so I've also seen a therapist and a psychiatrist over the last few years for assistance.
Try a LifeRing meeting! It's a secular addiction support group that has helped me immensely.   
AA is not for everyone but I believe you won't no until you give it an honest shot.  It sounds like you have and I applaud you for that!  AA works in my life (at this point) so I continue to go.  Keep working at sobriety and you will succeed.  
There are many paths...There are many tools and methods...AA is not the *Universal Panacea*...AA **is** probably the most prevalent accessible free group process available...**I have POWER over the alcohol that is NOT inside me**..That's why today I just forgo ONE drink - The First One
I've read Carr's books and liked the approach (I even quit smoking using his book) but I found Albert Ellis's When AA Doesn't Work For You: Rational Steps to Quitting Alcohol to offer a lot more actionable tools for dealing with the underlying causes of problem drinking. I don't think there's any one perfect solution for everyone but if you're not into the whole AA thing it might be worth a read. Good luck! 
Congrats on your sobriety!..Im fortunate to attend really good AA meetings. AA works for me and I know it doesn't for some...I just want to adress the cult comments. By definition a cult takes resources usually financial sometimes their very lives from its members and there is a leader. ..What do I as a member of AA gain by recruiting? What does the nonexistent leader gain through "brainwashing" us? Nothing. ..Tone is hard to read so please read this as just conversational I just think cult is thrown around too often in reference to AA. ..Have a great Monday everyone. 
To me it was replacing one dependence with another. My father started local groups was very involved did the regional etc meetings and all of that. He had 10 years sober twice and if he backed away he relapsed. He's no longer with us. I want freedom from dependence and not just alcohol dependence.
I found lots of reasons AA wouldn't work for me.  I wasn't powerless that was fucking stupid.  I wasn't going to believe in god either stupid weak minded religious folks.  Then when I was in enough pain and had lost enough I decided I'd go and try something different.  I realized what powerlessness meant was different than what I thought it meant.  I used to get prescribed a medication that was a stimulant.  I didn't even like stimulants but frequently I found myself abusing them just because they were in my pocket.  I also didn't like the feeling I got from drinking too much too fast but frequently found myself drunk.  That's what it meant to me. ..Also I'm still a godless heathen but I'm Ok with hearing god at meeting nowadays.  If it worked for them good.  I don't have to buy into all the AA dogma hook line and sinker.  I take what works and leave the rest.  
Oddly enough I had to change my thinking my whole attitude and outlook on life. ...Then again when I crawled into my first AA meeting  I had no hope of anything but dying of alcoholism.  ...I haven't had a drink since then.    I don't put alcohol or alcoholics on a pedestal.   I hope I never think drinking again is a good idea....True there are many paths to sobriety.   AA is the one I found and I have had 100% success with it. 
I'm beginning to feel this way about AA after going to a bunch of meetings in my first month. The real tipping point was a week ago when an older lady came up to me after the meeting (seeing that I was a newcomer to this particular meeting). She started with small talk but suddenly became very insistent and started talking at me. She said to me "YOU WOULDN'T HAVE WALKED IN HERE WITHOUT GOD WITHOUT GOD you would be in prostitution living on the street! "... She continued on and I started getting annoyed and was like lol "I made the decision to walk in here not god". ...She was like "Young lady you need to get on your knees every single day and pray or you will not stay sober. It's clear to me you haven't even read the first step."..I laughed I just couldn't help it. ...This ticked her off and she walked away while still talking about how I'm nothing without God. ...I am with you though. I prefer to feel empowered. When I feel beaten down and told I'm powerless it just depresses me.  ..
I didn't need to go to AA to become and remain sober. I am sure some AA folks will think I'm not really sober because I didn't go to AA. They might call people DRY DRUNKs or other bad names because we didn't do the 12 steps. I really don't need the 12 steps and don't believe they would help me in any way. Just my opinion.
You are not alone.  I've been going to AA 2x week for 8.5 months.  I have a sponsor I've read the BB 3 times I'm doing step work and I'm one hundred percent DONE with AA.  When I started I had very little knowledge about AA other than a feeling that it didn't work.  I gave it the college try and I can't stand it.  The only reason I still go is because it's ubiquitous.  
I've been going to meetings for almost 7 years and I've been sober a little over 5.5 years now. There have been meetings that I've just loved and to which I have kept going back (it's generally the people in them that are great though some meetings are in bars/restaurants and you can *eat awesome food during the meeting*); some meetings have been so bad I've left in the middle and never went back...I really struggled at first with feeling like I belonged in meetings because the way people talked/acted was too friendly or just too much; everyone was comfortable and happy and I was neither comfortable nor happy. I kept pulling away and I kept relapsing. I didn't like the idea of admitting I was/am powerless over alcohol and I resisted for over a year...Eventually I figured out I couldn't do it on my own (couldn't not take a drink as bizarre as that sounds) and that I needed help (but wasn't the sort of person that asked for help). So when I finally did just surrender and admit I was powerless over alcohol some kind of magic happened and I never took a drink again; after another year or two I stopped thinking about drinking altogether...I don't know what the magic is or how it worked for me but something about being in a room full of alcoholics from time to time keeps me sober. I don't have to pay anything I don't have have to sign anything I don't even have to use my real name -- but I do because in AA I found a new honest way of living and this is on top of relieving me of the obsession to drink. It doesn't work for everyone and I've seen people appear and never return (maybe they found sobriety somewhere else) but it's the only thing that worked for me after years of searching (and I enjoy the company *and it's free*) so I keep going back.
I've been attending meetings on and off for about 2 years now.  As someone else mentioned mainly because it's ubiquitous (it's free and pretty much everywhere).  And at this point I have my reasons for shying away from the program as well.  ..However my advice is: don't give up. Give it a full chance by at least going for several months get a sponsor etc.  Fully give it the ol' college try.  The reason I say this is because a lot of the things you mention (valid points btw) generally work themselves out - *If* the program is for you.
No doom and gloom in my AA meetings - even the one in prison...As for powerless - why are you here?   Seriously if you have the answers go for it.   ..Not to argue but in the beginning I had lots of "issues" with AA too.  I got wrapped up in definitions - and especially the god thing - truth was a big part of me did not want to get sober -and I thought that somehow I was smart enough to do it myself.  ..Turns out I wasn't - results may vary.
I dated a girl who's dad was 20+ years sober even with that length of sobriety he struggled every single day with it. He had a routine that included meetings prayer meditation etc. He woke up at 4 am every morning and went through a series of prayers that took 2 1/2 hours he was praying to remain sober for the next 24 hours... it was really something. He had been through the 12 steps and this was his maintenance. I think I always believed this was what was necessary to get and remain sober... and who knows maybe for some it really is. On the few occasions that I talked with him about alcohol he had an extremely defeatist view toward it... like it held some mystic power. I just couldn't and can't get behind that. Like you said its a drug... some people handle better than others. It took me about 20 years to figure out that I'm one of those people who can't control themselves once they start drinking but I am also one of those people (I hope) that can learn to control themselves from starting to drink. As a fellow "non believer" I can't get inline behind the "succumb to a higher power" stuff... I can view myself as in control... until a chemical response makes me lose control. And thats that for me.
Don't then.  I didn't go. I have a friend that does and from what she tells me about it it isn't for me. It works for her so that's great but I've just used this sub and the sheer hatred I have for my drunken self to get through. 
I love AA but that was a surprise. And dude it is doom and gloom sometimes. Nobody waltz' into an AA meeting on their wedding day. Don't live in a dream world. At the point you are even considering AA some fairly ugly behavior has had to have happened some introspective thoughts about ones self that maybe something is not quite right. I will be honest here. Sometimes I went to make sure there were people more fucked up.than me...that whole comparison thing. I'm not proud of that at all but some days in the beginning I attended as much forthem as I did myself. And once some guy said to me after I shared that he had come there to remember what it was liketo be newly sober. So if my life's shit has helped anyone else get their life together then please feed off my misery!
If it doesn't work for you it doesn't work for you. Nothing wrong with that...As far as powerless goes I know I'm powerless over alcohol. This isn't some article of AA-faith. I learned it from experience and it's what motivated me to seek out AA. I have proven to myself time and time again that once I take a drink I have no control over how much I drink after that.  That's all powerlessness means to me. I don't really wish it were different or wish I were normal because if wishes were horses you know? ..AA's not for everybody. If it's not for you that's cool; you just need to find what IS right for you because you are worth it. 
AA works for me. I needed a new way of looking at and living life. The big book and members of AA showed me how to deal with life without having to drink about it. I am forever grateful for accepting my powerlessness. It's pretty great not being the center of the universe. ..I looked into refuge recovery Carr and Smart. AA is the best option for me. 
In AA people were always telling me to take what works for me and leave the rest - but I really sucked at that in the beginning. AA was super overwhelming in the beginning. Until I got a little time under my belt I guess it was hard to tell what worked for me and what didn't. Therapy and SD got me through early sobriety and eventually I learned how to use AA to help me (and how to help others there).

I've had some mixed experiences going to AA. I live in a real small town and there's two groups within half an hour to me. The first one I went to was my first time going to AA ever. I gained a lot of wisdom and support there but after going every day for about a month I saw that many of the members were telling the story of their worst moments to themselves and the group over and over in order to keep themselves sober. I'm glad that that works for them but I want to move past the things I've done while drinking not relive them endlessly. ..I also had a few people tell me that if I wasn't coming to meetings every day I was already slipping and alcohol already was starting to regain its hold on me. That was frustrating to hear because I at that point I was going to ever meeting in town that I wasn't working during and being able to hold a steady job was damn sure something I had regained with sobriety. ..The 2nd group has been far less negative. People discuss the good things they've gained and the bad things they've shed. One woman there said something that really stuck with me concerning the culty vibe that some groups can give off. The gist of it was that some people use a dependence on AA to replace their dependence on alcohol rather than using AA to create a dependence-free lifestyle. ..I would suggest trying out several different groups if that's possible. Even if you don't end up liking the meetings themselves you could meet people that you mesh with better and form an informal group that way. 
There are many paths. Find yours. I went to AA for one week about 9 months ago. The first day I missed a meeting I drank. So I was then using AA as a crutch instead of my own will power. I drank for two more months and finally quit one day because I got sick with shingles. Haven't drank since and I'm doing it with this place and daily "playing it forwards" when I want to drink. I agree with you and that's how it felt to me. I'm glad it helps some though!
I think what you said about the constant remainder about the alcohol has to do with the different levels of craving each one has. I'm also worried people will talk too much about this. And I do not crave as much the alcohol not all the time anyway...
I too am a big fan of the Easy Way to Stop Drinking. That book and audiobook were a huge help to my recovery. I also found 30 Day Sobriety Solution to be helpful probably not as much as the Easy Way for me but that's not a knock on 30DSS.  I have no affiliation with either books and will likely seek other materials in the future.  And I agree with others that there is no one cure for all. But for you and me AA isn't a good resource. SD however has been amazing an amazing substitute.
