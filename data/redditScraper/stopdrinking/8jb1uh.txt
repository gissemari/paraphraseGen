Something occurred to me about relapsing because of course I've quit drinking before and have then gone back out...The last time I gave up drinking when I started up again I went from not drinking any wine to drinking TWO entire bottles in about three hours. After all we were old friends meeting up again. And this friend and I have always been able to skip all the small talk and go straight for what really matters. And every time it's as if no time has passed. It's the type of friend you brag to others about. You say  We don't even have to catch up! We know one another that well! We can be away from each other for months or even a year and pick up just where we left off!  ..Only the last time this friend left me (on my birthday no less) kneeling in front of a shitter puking my brains out. Didn't even have the decency (or hands because wine bottles don't have hands) to hold my hair back...I should name this friend.
