Last week as I was driving to visit family a friend I knew through AA reached out for help. He was three years clean and sober but going through a rough break-up and feeling lonely. I tired to say what I could and offer to meet with him when I got back on Monday. He said he was okay and had plans with his sponsor. Wednesday I sent him a "Hey how are you doing?" text. No response. This afternoon I called and it went straight to voicemail.  ..For one reason or another I felt a need to search the obituaries.  Sure enough there he was. Dead on Wednesday at the age of 41. I'm not sure what happened. If it was suicide or a relapse and OD. Truth is that it doesn't much matter at this point...I called my sponsor and said a prayer for his family. That helped but it truly has been a tough day. I can say it has made me grateful for my own sobriety. He taught me a lot in the past three years but this final lesson has hit the hardest...Rest easy Jeff.
