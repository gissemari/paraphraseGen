So I have never posted in here or on reddit for that matter but here I am. I haven't had a drink in an entire fucking month. I'm proud of myself but I'm also exhausted and I have a toddler who won't leave me alone (he cute tho) and a therapist who wants me to go to an AA meeting. I'm struggling to get to a meeting. I'm shy and I know that it will be okay but I'm tired. May I ask you guys some questions? Here goes:..Besides speaking to someone in a meeting how do you find out where the good meetings are? (Pretty sure I know the answer to this one. haha).Also for the ladies out there-- do you get creeped on in meetings?.And has anyone experienced child-friendly meetings? Are they even worth it if you have to keep an eye on your spawn the whole time?..This turned into one random ass post so thank you for reading if you've gotten this far. I feel very lucky to have all of you people. I mean it...IWNDWYT (&amp; I haven't for a month!)

Welcome to reddit and to SD!..I'm not an AA-goer myself and am a child-free bloke so can't answer your questions but I'm sure that someone else will chime in with their experiences.....Congrats on 30 days and keep up the good work!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Congrats on your 30 days! I don't have any answers ya but I'm interested to see what other people's experiences are.
