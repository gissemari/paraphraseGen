Hey folks a few weeks ago I posted about giving SDers first crack at some items I would likely be donating to charity.  I figured that many of us while getting sober are struggling a little bit and might be able to use a few items.  Well I have started to go through stuff here at our house and here are some preliminary items:.. - ~~A black Eddie Bauer backpack that I bought 4 years ago.  I used it for commuting to my office and is in reasonably good shape.  I impulsively bought a new one a few weeks ago.  Otherwise I was still regularly using it.~~  **taken**.. - A Wilson leather baseball mitt.  I purchased it new years ago when I thought I would play ball with my boys...turns out my boys don't play ball.  Anyway it is for a right-handed player so it fits on the left hand.  It has virtually never been used.  It would be great for anyone about 12 years and older... - ~~A Mario Bros kids clock (that has "Ben" on it).~~  **Taken**.. - Size 2 Adidas kids soccer shoes that are in good condition (worn for one season).  They are "Messi" shoes.  Might be perfect for someone with a small child who will be growing into soccer shoes in the next year or so... - ~~Soft plastic knee pads (brand new) that are given out to workers on the railroad for knee protection while kneeling and working.  They have never been used.~~  **Taken**  .. - Size 4 boys winter boots... - Assorted boys and girls clothing - the only way to describe this is to ask you to either post or pm me specifics of what you might be looking for and I can check and get back to you.  My two boys are 15 and 13 and my daughter is 10 if that helps... - My daughter came up with an idea to have a coat drive for winter coats/clothing for homeless people.  We are expecting between 50 and 100 people next weekend to come by our house and drop of clothing.  Many already have.  I have no problem pulling a few items for needy SDers out there but again you would need to specifically contact me with what your needs are in this area (kids adults male/female sizes etc).  After her drive she will be delivering the clothing to a group that clothes the homeless so I will only have access to the clothing for a week or so...Ok that is a brief summary of some things I have found.  I opted not to take pictures of all of this because well I am technically challenged and have no idea how I would put several pictures up on here.  Therefore if you have an interest in a single item and would like me to send you a picture I will be happy to do so.  ..As long as shipping is not out of hand I am happy to pay some shipping costs.  However I might ask you to pay your own shipping costs.  ..Also I am sure I have other things (shoes soccer balls games books framed pictures for walls etc) but it is hard to find things to give away.  What do all of you (and the mods) think of an SD group/exchange where people can both post things they can give away AND people in need could post requests for items?  Maybe someone will see a request and say "crap I have something like that laying around.  Let me pay it forward and help someone out."..If anyone has a problem posting publicly that they are in need of something I have listed here feel free to PM me.  ..Thank you and hopefully someone can be helped.  Have a great day folks...

May I Please have the knee pads? I just started a job where they come in very useful because I have to kneel on hard floors but I can't afford any at the moment. Thank you!
I'll give that Mario clock a great home if you'll let me pay for shipping...
My husband and I are taking care of his daughter and my nephew- both 5yo. Most of their clothes were lost before we got them- pm me if you still have anything
I'm going to jump on /u/nika65's coattails and offer **0-3 month old baby cloths hats and blankets**. Let me know if you want details and any of this:..* Clothes include a wide variety of shirts light sleepers and warn fleece sleepers. Colors tend to "gender neutral" or blue...* Several hand-knit wool hats...* Baby blankets galore. Quilts throws and my favorite are lightweight flannel swaddlers.
