My kids and I stayed with my parents for the past 3 nights and the struggle of not-drinking wasn't even a blip on my radar (aside from not sleeping well). It felt like a vacation being at their house cooking dinner for everyone eating as a family...I just got to my house now with the kids and the desire to drink punched me in the face the second I saw the dishes that needed doing and the toys all over the living room. To be honest I've wanted a drink all day. I was listening to selfhelp Youtube channels about healing from narcissistic abuse and instead of feeling validated and enlightened I just felt more and more broken and ashamed...I didn't drink today at least....

Great work on not drinking!..Sounds like you're internalizing some negative thoughts though. You say you feel broken and ashamed. That's not you my friend that's just how you think about some action you did in the past. But none of that defines you. You care enough about yourself to post here looking for help. So keep trying that's all you really have to do...Also if you haven't yet talk to a therapist. Sounds like stress is triggering something in you. It will make you feel better or at least it won't make you feel worse.
Just keep it together until bedtime.  Every day further from the last drink made it easier for me.  
That's good advice you only need to make it until bedtime and then you are home free. I've had these similar struggles and then don't start until almost my bedtime. All I really needed to do was hang out for 20 more minutes and then just hit the hay.
