Hi Sobernauts..I hope everyone is enjoying their weekend so far! I'm just chilling out researching my upcoming trip to Bali! It was very wall of text-ey and I didn't even want to re-read it so I put in some bullet points and put the main points in bold. Still a bit wall of text-y so apologies in advance...I've been really looking forward to this holiday but in the past half hour or so I've just been filled with dread. I don't plan on relapsing. I wouldn't ruin the trip for myself or my husband by doing that but I know there is a **lot of drinking in Bali**.  I knew this while booking and we have purposely booked in villages/towns that aren't party central but there is still a lot of drinking where we are going. ..My husband barely drinks and is extremely supportive of my sobriety so I'm sure he won't be drunk all the time but still a lot of other people around us will... ..So **here are my plans** but I look forward to any advice:..* I have the **Easyway to Control Alcohol** on my iPhone as an audiobook and the shorter **No More Hangovers** book on my kindle. I may actually listen to Easyway again before I go so it's fresh in my head. ..* I've got the **AA Big Book the NA Basic Text and Living Clean** on my kindle. I'm currently reading the NA Basic Text so may try to read a couple stories a day...* My love affair with AA is kind of over but there is a pretty big 'recovery-scene' in Seminyak where we are staying for the second half of the trip so **I'll print out a meetings list before I go** - it's without a doubt better safe than sorry. Also I'll be celebrating my 6 month sober-versiry while I'm there so I may even grab a chip! ..* I'll **stay out of bars**. The beach pools and places we'll eat will serve booze but I'll make a point of not going to actual bars...* I've got **activities** planned in the first few days I'm going to do a package with 5 dives over the two days we also are going to bike down a volcano and go white water rafting. ..* We've got wifi at both hotels we are staying at so I'll do the **daily check in and read posts on SD.** ..* I'm seeing my GP on Monday to **refill my [Campral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acamprosate) prescription** which I realised yesterday I'd run out of while I'm in Bali. I'm thinking of **talking to him about [Antabuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disulfiram)** as well just for the trip. With all the things above it's doubtful that I'll even consider drinking while I'm there *but* knowing it would make me violently ill could maybe help? ..* Finally I'll be really **communicative with my husband**. I don't talk about my sobriety too much with him but I will on the trip. ..**I'm hoping some of you awesome sobernauts have had super-fun sober holidays and can give me some advice or let me know if from your experience you think I'm on the right track?** ..Thanks friends!

Bali is the most wonderful place on earth!..It is so peaceful and relaxing that you may not even feel the urge to drink.  I went while I was still heavily drinking and somehow managed not to get drunk on the trip (though we drank everyday).  Such a tranquil scene I was truly intoxicated by the people and my surroundings.  Plus the drinks were very weak ;)..My advice?  Stay away from the islands.  Big party scene on Gili T.  Ahmed was paradise.  Most of the peeps were there to scuba dive yoga and generally relax...Honestly I think you've chosen a wonderful destination to holiday without drinking.  I can't wait to go back sober...Have so much fun!....
Well it sounds like you have some good solid plans in place. Ack! I'm so excited for you! It sounds like such a good time. Before I was drinking all the time I learned to dive and went rafting a few times. It was so much fun! I do not like to ride my bike too fast though; it scares me.....Sorry I don't really have any advice for you. I haven't had a vacation in years...You are both going to have such a great time!
&gt;I've got activities planned..This is what I've loved most about my sober vacations my mind is on the activities or on relaxing not on planning my next drink.
