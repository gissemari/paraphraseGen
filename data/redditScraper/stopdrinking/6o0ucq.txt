I know my older brother is drinking allot.  He works nights 4pm-12 Monday and Tuesday off.  I know when he gets off work on Sunday and his weekend begins  he's drunk until he goes to work on Wednesday.  He lives alone in another state.  Should I say something to him?  I feel like I don't have enough experience being sober and have relapsed many times myself to not sound like a hypocrite.
