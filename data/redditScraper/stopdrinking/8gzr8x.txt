My daughter had been on my case about a few little craft-y things she wanted me to do for her and I finally got around to doing them. And laundry and a bit of food prep and I even had time after to stay up a bit and play a fun new video game. This was the first thing she said to me this morning when she came downstairs and realized all the things she'd wanted were taken care of with out any more excuses or delays...I've been on this road for awhile now and as I learn more about alcohol and sobriety the latter is becoming ever more appealing. The support in this community is incredible. I've had a recent reset but I'm feeling really good and positive about the future. I finally have a relapse prevention plan in place and I have all the lovely incredible people in the chat as well as IRL connections to back me up and help keep me on track. I'm doing it for me this time. IWNDWYT

Woohoo!! Good on you
This time I'm doing it for me and it feels way different.  Even my therapist said I seem different now.  It's not easy and I know I will still have to fight cravings today and down the road but not drinking and actually living life is so rewarding.  And I've found myself being so much more productive around the house and more attentive to my kids.  No more "daddy you said you were going to do \[fill in the blank\]" because I actually follow through.  IWNDWYT.
Love it. So much good time out there to be had :\-\)
