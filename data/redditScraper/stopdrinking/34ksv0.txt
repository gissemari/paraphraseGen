I've had problems with drinking for a few years now. I was never a big drinker and didn't even start drinking at all until I was 22. It soon became a crutch that I just got more and more addicted to. Between a struggling relationship untreated depression and anxiety and being a caregiver everything has just gotten out of control...There is something that has given me the motivation I need to stop though. See I've been taking care of my mother since I was a teenager and over the years my responsibilities as a caregiver have grown so much that it's a full-time job now. Constantly seeing my mother in such a sick state has made me want to be as healthy as I can so that I can continue to take care of her. I also don't want my own problems or health to ever become an issue for my children should I ever have any or my boyfriend. I also want to be healthy for myself as well because I feel life slipping away from me. I don't want to wake up one day when I'm older and regret my entire life because of alcohol. I want to actually live and enjoy life as much as I can...I just thought I'd make a post as a sort of accountability that I'm serious about it. I'd love some support advice or tips as well because I really don't have a lot of that and will be going at this mostly alone. Thanks!
