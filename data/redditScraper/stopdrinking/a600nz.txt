I've been sober for a couple months and I've been fairly strong through the whole thing. But recently drinking has come into conversation a lot because we've gone to places where people drink. And when I mention not drinking anymore he says something along the lines of  babe you're talking about drinking a lot are you okay? Are you sure? Are you struggling?  How do I convince him I'm not struggling and am just talking about it because it's been present in our daily lives? I don't want to anger him and push him away when he's very obviously trying to help and be supportive during my sobriety. I just want him to believe me when I say I'm okay.

This is just my take but it sounds like *he* feels uncomfortable with you bringing it up around others. ..If he's genuinely concerned about you a simple "I'm fine!" should suffice. But if his motive is to get you to stop talking about your sobriety then sounds like you need a different conversation about why that bothers him. ..Personally I find talking about how I quit drinking very affirming. 
I am okay but I do probably also think about drinking/not drinking more than other people--I'm focused on this healing process and everything. Processing things doesn't mean you're in trouble.
He sounds like a wonderfully supportive boyfriend. You are very lucky!!  I guess the best way to lessen his discomfort is just not to pick up. 
Could you get him to read a book maybe?..When my wife read This Naked Mind after me her eyes were opened to just how pervasive alcohol is everywhere - and it became an interesting topic for us to discuss.
