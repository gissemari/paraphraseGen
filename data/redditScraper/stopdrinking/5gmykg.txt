Over the weekend my 2 months came and went. I commented on it to my partner on our way to dinner last night and he told me how proud he was of me and that was it. I didn't celebrate I didn't feel the need. I feel like the last month has flown by. Up until this since I was 18 years old (currently 26) I had never not drank for more than a month. It's a big deal and it's not...There's some bad...I think the bad essentially boils down to I have things I still don't like about myself and my life. I have things I still need to work on. I'm shopping too much eating out too much staying up too late and sleeping too late and overall am still not where I want to be. Stopping drinking didn't automatically fix these things for me. If anything they've allowed me to see the problems more clearly and feel the shame of not working on them even more intensely. ..I've also forgotten what it was like to be hungover. Even to be drunk. I think about trying to moderate. I put it off. Every time my brain goes there I tell myself "maybe someday but not today". So far it's working but we'll see how it goes as even more time passes...I worry my friends and family are starting to find me a bit preachy about drinking. I'm trying not to be. I'm just SO EXCITED about how far I've come it's hard not to want to talk about it...But the good. Oh the good. ..I'm not combining spending money on alcohol with my other bad shopping habits. I'm sure I'm shopping more because I feel like I can because I'm not spending money on alcohol but it's still not as bad as when I would go on shopping binges and was spending a ton of money on booze...I have more energy to exercise. I've gone through phases over the last two months were I exercise a ton and then don't and then exercise a ton again and then don't again. This is pretty common for me. Now though I feel like my workouts are actually accomplishing something rather than just keeping the beer belly at bay. I feel more empowered. I feel like I have the ability to push myself more...I've picked up new hobbies. I've started crocheting. I can't imagine I would have done as much of it as I have if I were still drinking. I LOVE hanging out with my friends with a crochet project in my lap. I get to participate in the conversation however much I want. I find I follow the conversations just as well if not better. And I've gotten a scarf an ear warmer and a cute little Yoda out of it so far...I've come to appreciate my friends and family more than ever. It's been such a wonderful journey to discover how much I like hanging out with my friends without drinking. They're wonderful fun people and they don't pressure me to drink and I don't feel out of place when I hang out with them without drinking. I've been told by a couple of friends that they forgot I wasn't drinking and hadn't even noticed at our last few get togethers. I've discovered the wonders of being "fun drunk". Essentially I find that fun and silliness are infectious. If I'm having a good time with good friends or my family I feel like I'm just as drunk as they are even though I'm completely sober. I get silly I get loud I have just as much if not more fun as when I would drink with them. I am so so lucky to have the group of friends I have...Overall I just feel more clear headed than I have in years. I'm more reflective. I'm more patient. I feel like I can achieve the things I want as long as I'm willing to put the effort in. I want more for myself and that's what has really made it all worthwhile for me. I like how I feel now. I want to keep it going. I also don't want to go back to those first few weeks of sobriety again because it wasn't as good as this is. The biggest point I want to make with this post is if you're struggling through the beginning know that it's worth it. Where I am now at day 62 it's worth the struggle I put in on day 12 day 22 day 31. If I relapse someday that would be too bad but now I know what day 62 feels like and if I relapse I know I will struggle back here again. Because it's worth it...I'm not drinking today so that I can know what day 63 feels like. Stay sober my friends. It's so so worth it.
