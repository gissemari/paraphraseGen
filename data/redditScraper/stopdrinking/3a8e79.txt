After many many relapses and pushing my ego to the side thinking I could get sober by myself with nobodies help I finally went to my first AA meeting.  I normally keep to myself and I am usually a quiet guy who gets nervous talking to strangers.  So I was pretty nervous about going and tried to talk myself out of going.  Eventually I just told myself to suck it up and go at least for one night.  It was much better than what I was expecting and even though I didn't have to share my story I went ahead anyways and it felt so good to be able to talk to people about my problem and to get it off my chest...I am definitely looking forward to going to my next meeting.

Congratulations! For me going to meetings changed how I felt but getting a sponsor and doing the steps changed who I was.

That's awesome! Those meetings somehow did the impossible for me. Not only did they convince me that I can have a completely fulfilling life without booze but they taught me to not even WANT another drink. The obsession is gone. And man oh man was it ever an obsession. 24/7 I thought about drinking. Yes even in my sleep.
