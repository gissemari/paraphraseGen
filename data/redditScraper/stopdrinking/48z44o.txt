It's been exactly six months since September 4th of last year when I woke up sober for the first time. I was a dying man. Today I still struggle with myself most of the time with my behaviors feelings and thoughts but I've been doing the work in recovery and I asked a lot of people to help me. If I continue doing that I think I can stay sober one day at a time. This sub has been an interesting experience. I really appreciate the daily check-ins. Never thought it would mean that much to me. Thank you all!

September 4th was my quit date too congrats on 6 months! Thanks for reminding me it's my 18 month today! :)..I remember that first sober day it's really added up just taking things day by day. I've done some CBT work on my thoughts/feelings/behaviours it's helped and will stay a work in progress :)
