It's funny how the brain can suddenly throw cravings your way...&amp;#x200B;..I know I have been triggered by it being Friday night finishing early and being a little bored. Plus personal issues that would not be helped by drinking. Still it's almost bed time and I have got this far through the evening...&amp;#x200B;..I will not drink with you tonight.

Stay strong OP!..You can do the thing.
Thanks for sharing and that boredom is a tough one but you hit the nail on the head on that personal problem.  I don't even know what it is and am without a shadow of a doubt sure that pouring alcohol on it won't make it better.  Proud of your clean time let's knock out this 24 and then go from there.

I envision the nasty hangover I will have and all the dumbshit that I will say and have to clean up at the end of the bender. This has been keeping me in check lately.
Keep it up!!! Good job
Me too!  I could have a few drinks relax have a little fun then fall right to sleep.  And then wake up 4 hours later dehydrated and feel like crap tomorrow.  But my number is higher than it has been in a long time and I don't want to start over.  I guess I'll just not drink with you tonight.
