Today was friggin frustrating.  I didnt want to drink but sure as hell knew when i would have started drinking in the past...I changed over to snow tires today.  I was frustrated with having to move a bunch of junk and organize things so i had room to work.  It felt like i had to do 2 extra jobs before each step to get set up do the work then clean up.  For sure I would have popped a beer half an hour into the job.  That means id have had 3 by the time i finished...Instead i recognized that i had to deal with it and get thru things.  I finished had some food and water then figured i earned a sit-down for a bit.  Before i would not have been tired because i would have had super beer energy and i would have kept on drinking all day and evening...After i had some errands to run so took the kids.  They were at each other and wouldnt listen busy store late dinner hangry......  very stressful...Got home cracked a club soda then another.  Struggled with the kids until bed time...Nothing terrible happened but damn it felt like it just kept building and building i still feel tense and stressed...I feel like i should go for a run or something but its nearly bed time now.  Maybe i shoulda done that an hour ago?  Seems like i gotta get rid of the stress as soon as it starts i cant wait till the end of the day and think its all just going to go away...You guys ever get this buildup of negative feelings and stress?  What do you do?..

Yes. Every damn day of my life. Lately if I can't go to the gym or go for a run I soak in a hot tub and meditate. If I can't focus long enough to meditate I just practice my breathing techniques. Long deep breaths in for 4 and long deep exhales for 4. 
It gets easier. Then it gets harder. Then it gets easier again. I had probably my strongest cravings around the mark you are at. Trust me when I say that the really bigger benefits don't become realized until farther down the road still.
