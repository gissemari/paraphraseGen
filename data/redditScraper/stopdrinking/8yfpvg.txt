For a second there  while drinking I thought I was happy at work. ..Although the days were long and hard (&amp; calling out sick way too often)... and sometimes I'd wake up slightly hung over from 3 beers- yet I'd feel an excitement about the work I was doing and who I was working with at the office tho though walking in with fog brain. :/..... it's kind of a haze I didn't journal so I'm not sure if that's entierly true on how I felt...And that's the thing now. I'm out of the haze and am wondering if how I felt was a facade- the work I'm doing has lost its excitement and that scares me to no end. I think I may have lost the love for my field? There's no heart from me in it and I'm realizing it this week (in my field for almost 20 yrs)..Am I now seeing what I'm doing for what it is instead of drowning the bad feelings about my field or who I work with? Fk... or am I making this up? Is this a thing that happens...?.. Feeling so miserable/stressed and confused right now + 2nd cold in 1 month - really trying to stay positive but feeling this struggle with my longest term relationship...

There are some great things coming out of my sobriety  perhaps I need to be leading with these things.
I know what you mean sometimes alcohol has a way of making us think we're happy. I'm sure you'll figure out your career path! When I was drinking I was getting average reviews at work. I could barely even focus from the brain fog and hangovers. Since I quit I've been given a 5 (the best possible review at my company) and I got a raise and a promotion:)
Do what you are passionate about and you just may find it's what you're good at...And then success and happiness purpose and joy in your work will follow naturally by not pursuing them...
