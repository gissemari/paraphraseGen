Hi everyone!..Just checking in. I have to admit that I'm a bit stumped about what to say today. I had a long talk with my sponsor this morning and there's a lot I could probably talk about from that but I'm sorta just trying it on and mulling it over. I'm not really ready to commit to saying anything about it just yet...There's a guy who goes to one of my meetings who self-describes as  an alcoholic and a dope fiend  who's had more than a couple of sober trips around the sun. He often mentions keeping a [beginner's mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin) in sobriety. As he sees it once he thinks that he's got sobriety all figured out he's going to go back out and drink and drug again and end up dead...I'm at a hard place in my sobriety right now. I'm not struggling to stay sober. And I don't mind the work that I'm putting into my sobriety. It's all fairly easy and often sorta enjoyable. But I'm struggling with all of the things that I know that I need to address and change. I know that as a person I'm not where I want to be. And it takes time and effort to address that so I just have to do what I can right now and then just sit with where I'm at right...I would rather not. I'm not very good at accepting that sometimes I just have to accept where I am and keep my head down and do the work and trust that I'll make it where I need to be in the end. I'm a big fan of deciding how I think things should be and efforting my way through things in an attempt to make them happen how I think they should happen and on my timeline...I'm fighting where I'm at. I want to be elsewhere in my life. I want things to be otherwise. I want to be someone other than who I am...I don't know how that fits in with keeping a beginner's mind in recovery. I guess that a beginner is open to possibilities and isn't trying to force things through on an agenda...Something that my friend said in her lead on Friday was that she didn't used to have a good self-esteem but now that she's been sober for three years she's had three years of esteemable acts to feel good about. Which is what I have to trust. I have to trust right now that if I keep plugging away at what I know I should be doing and what I need to work on I will feel better about myself and where I'm at...Anyway I'm sorta just grasping at straws today sobernauts. This time of year is funky. It's probably not a good idea to spend too much time on aimless introspection. I'm going to do the next right thing instead which today will be taking my laptop to a coffee shop to work on a cover letter for a job opening that a friend just tipped me to. I hope that you all are well...Ginger_Sprout Out

Hi Ginger I am also "struggling". Not with not drinking but with december the process and/or just being me I think. Other "solutions" than not drinking I don't have at the moment. Maybe it's just enough for now. I'll trust that this to shall pass and I can move "forward" again. I'm wishing you calm days. IWNDWYT
I wish you the best for potential job and the Holiday.  IWNDWYT
