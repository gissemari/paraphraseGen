I remember it is not the destination but the journey that makes this struggle worth while.  I battle hopelessness and pointlessness with the belief in the future results of my hard work.  I will not bow to the great wheel of time that grinds on in attempt to break my spirit.  I will be better than I was before I will enjoy successes I have not yet imagined.  If no one has told you people they love you today let me be the first.  I love you and IWNDWYT.

I'm trudging with you! Thanks for the bit of inspiration. 
I'm trudging too...but I will not drink with you today!
Love back atcha! I have those trudging days too.
hey you're on 125 days and that's pretty awesome. congrats! pat yourself on the back and give yourself a delicious treat because that's not an easy achievement and it's an inspiration to the likes of me who are still in double digits. the trudging is paying off and the sober days are ticking along. this too shall pass. you got this my friend! IWNDWYT!
I'm working on stuff that I won't see the fruits of for another year or two.  Also working on stuff I see today also working on stuff I'll see unfolding gradually with no idea how long it'll last or if I'll continue with it beyond this job.  It's ALL worth it.  I was just commenting about how boring my life looks from the outside but I'm ecstatic on the inside.. there's no way I'd be here a couple months back.. it just would not be the same!!!     I'm glad your here mech_e_wander this whole journey is really worth it and it's a treasure to be able to share it with you.  I love you too!!!
