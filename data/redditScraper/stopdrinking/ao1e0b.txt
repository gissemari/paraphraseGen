I'll reset the counter when i figure out how. I relapsed hard last week and have basically been on an 8 day bender. I tried not to i didn't want too but i let stress get to me. I don't know why i thought it would make anything better. I've even got to start my antidepressants again as i've depleted the build up. I'm not trying to be a sympathy case btw just venting to a familiar community...My problem is my best mate. I'm closer to him than any human on earth might sound odd but he's my absolute world as i don't have any family. He had a bad few days last week and rang me about it he had a bit of a breakdown to me and it was horrible he rarely opens up to me so when he does somethings wrong. I stuck with it on the phone until he was ok but it destroyed me that there was nothing i could do to stop him hurting. So i drank. ..Anyone have any coping mechanisms? With him having a bad time atm and my workload about to explode i can't afford to turn to drink. I have 35 blokes under my care and my job is all about safety. I'm lucky enough to live rural so theres a few fields i've been using to go and have full on breakdowns but i cant afford that luxury when i return to work...I'm back in work on Monday dreading the 5 day hangover that comes with the binge...Like i say not a sympathy vote i just need to shout at someone and vent. I hope you're all doing well.

Congratulations on your day 1! Just take it 1 day at a time. My best coping mechanism is to play it forward: yes those drinks will numb the pain/turn  off the noise but the next day (or at 3am!) they are back and amplified with hangover anxiety feelings of guilt and of regret. Usually that helps me not have that first drink. IWNDWYT!
