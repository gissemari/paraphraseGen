Ok so I've been trying to stop drinking for awhile now and I'm going to make it stick this time. I haven't had a drink since New Year's Eve (not a resolution because there's a stigma that people don't follow through with resolutions) and I haven't had a good nights sleep since. Insomnia and restless sleep are my two problems. I understand that I'm going through withdrawals because I'd drink until I'd pass out and stay out until the morning. But my question is does anybody have any tips on how to speed up the process? More precisely how to fall asleep and stay asleep through the night? Any advice on this or how to keep from relapsing will be much appreciated!

I know it seems interminable when you're going through it but my sleep patterns resolved between 7-10 days sober. I have used benadryl in the past to help me fall asleep too and it usually works. Best wishes!
I just waited it out and eventually my body adjusted.  However my addiction therapist at the time suggested somnapure (a natural sleep aid sold OTC at drug stores) and I used it a couple of times and it helped.
My shrink has suggested benadryl to me and says it's non-habit-forming. But in the past I've always found that the insomnia wears off after a few days.
I find that liquid melatonin helps..
