I'm reading a new book called  Nothing good can come from this  by Kristi Coulter. It especially speaks to me as a woman who has struggled to get and stay sober. Wanted to share the love. IWNDWYT

I'm always looking for new books. Thanks for the suggestion!..A couple books by women I found really wonderful were *Between Breaths: A Memoir of Panic and Addiction* by Elizabeth Vargas and *Drink: The Intimate Relationship Between Women and Alcohol* by Anne Dowsett Johnston. There's a bunch of other great books on recovery on [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/books) if you haven't already checked it out. ..I also really love Laura McKowen's [blog](https://www.lauramckowen.com/blog/) and FB posts. ..Stay strong! I won't drink with you today. .
Loved that bookwritten about me ! IWNDWYT
