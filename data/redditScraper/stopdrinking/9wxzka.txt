I can feel the insanity creeping in. I don't want to go back. Part of my mind is weighing its options waiting to strike. .. When will be the right time? When will be the right place circumstance amount company special occasion? Are you really going to stay sober through thanksgiving?? Are you really not drinking at all for Christmas or your birthday???? Since you feel so much better now don't you think you can just start over and learn how to drink better? ..Fuck offff!!! I drive drunk!!! I make a fool out of myself!! I spend money I don't have!! I feel reckless and out of control and riddled with guilt the next day!! Things are finally okay now. Why can't you just leave me alone?..I'm struggling. I don't want to do it. I won't do it. Lord help me hold on.

Hey BabyPrincessAlpaca :) hang in there friend. There's often a rough patch of mental health around the two-four week mark.. it gets better. Well done on a month - you're doing great!  You're posting here and reaching out instead of drinking - that's a great start.  Best of luck to you  - Talie
you and me both. deep breathes. so many positive reasons to keep going along with the negative. we can become a better happier us.
30 days is awsome. One day at a time. That first drink will solve nothing and only feed the thirsty alcohol deprived brain. It really is the alcohol talking - not your real self. Stay strong on the journey. IWNDWYT
