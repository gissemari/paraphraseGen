It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-----------------------------------------..**Struggle:** I am staying in a small village in the Adirondack Mountains where I know most of the people. Going out even just to pick up groceries or get gasoline can mean running into folks and it can be like attending a high school reunion every day. I'm introverted so it can be tough and now of course I don't have alcohol to make social situations easier. ..**Triumph:** When I was drinking I got so fat and my face was so bloated from all the booze that I used to avoid people just because I didn't want them to see how far downhill I'd gone. At least now I don't feel that I have to hide myself any more. In fact I'm happy to be seen out and about...**General:** I lost the bloat when I stopped drinking and I got back to my previous weight but my body is a different shape now than it was when I was younger. It's like my friend Michael (drag name Peaches) recently said when we were trying on clothes:  It's not really that you get fatter as you get older. It's just that what you already have migrates to other parts of your body.

Struggle- bringing home a bottle of homemade wine made by my fancy boss.....Triumph- no more fights with hubby about me having time away from him. I was able to go to my boss's house with my coworkers without him questioning how much I drank. His biggest concern was if I brought home leftovers from the fancy work dinner I attended...General- debating who to give the bottle to... my fancy dad? Wondering when I'll be able to fall asleep despite the adderall I took this morning. Melatonin vitamin c and chamomile tea aren't workin...
Love the Adirondacks. Been to Eagle Bay a few times. ..Really craved hard today pushed through it. Now reading and browsing reddit with my SO next to me also sober. 
Struggle: Loneliness; isolation in sobriety; apprehension about taking the necessary steps to reach out and pursue healthy social outlets and new relationships...Triumph: I made it through the first major hurdle/procedure of some expensive protracted dental work I need to get done. I've been dreading the expense pain and extended time it will take for months. As of this past week I know that it's manageable and affordable and will have cosmetic benefits I had not anticipated. ..General: I'm feeling very good physically and mentally; and more stable in my sobriety. Looking forward to some rad concerts and other fun stuff this summer. Slowly but surely working on some career moves. Doing my best to cultivate sobriety as a practice and to acknowledge all the many blessings it brings however small they seem...Great thread!
Maybe you need a Hollywood movie star disguise.  A wig a big floppy hat &amp; sunglasses.  Or the mustache fake nose &amp; glasses gag is...well maybe just the hat and glasses.  I can relate about wanting to just be left alone and not get sucked into those conversations with the obligatory family &amp; personal history update lurking around any corner.  Good job losing weight!  I am dropping it sooooooo sloooooowwwww.  But I quit smoking and didn't gain ten pounds so fuck it...**Struggle:**  Trying to figure out which direction I want to go is rough.  I feel like so many but questions are looming in front of me and I don't know what I want.  Live in town or stay in the country. . Work fancy dream job full time and have a crazy busy life or stay where I'm comfortable but poor and not stretching my potential.  Stay married and together or try living apart.  I feel like what I want changes every damn hour.  OMG.  It's probably because I'm exhausted from all the work I've put into the recent job stuff...**Triumph:**  Three weeks cigarette nicotine and vape free.  It's been a wild few weeks.  I'm liking it.  And rocking the job interview was a nice triumph too.  ..**General:** Happy [Juneteenth](https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/6/19/17476482/juneteenth-holiday-emancipation-african-american-celebration-history).
Amen Thank you. IWNDWYT
**S:** Signing up for the NCLEX (nursing exam) I have a criminal record and so I have to get approval from the state licensing board until I can even sign up for the exam...**T:** I've been cooking instead of eating out.  It doesn't sound like much of a triumph but it is.  It's a lot of work to cook for myself and seven year old daughter...**G:** Defenestration means to throw someone out of a window.  In a sentence it would be like this child is going to get defenestrated if she keeps eating my ice cream.
**Struggle:** I was too slow to decide on the summer holiday so in effect I won't see my son for nearly two months. My ex wife could change this at any point but won't. Instead she's teaching me a lesson. I learned enough from ten years of abuse thank you very much...**Triumph:** I'm attending his graduation from children's school tonight (he's 12 going to youth level). The last months have shifted my focus from my pain to my kids' needs and in the process I've realized more of how much they love me. That *I* am lovable is a crazy thought but let's be crazy then!..**General:** Love life!
Struggle: I'm going through a lot in therapy right now dredging up a lot of trauma and abuse. I sometimes feel like I don't know how to live like a normal human -- everything seems to revolve around this trauma/recovery vortex and sometimes I just want to LIVE my LIFE without thinking about this stuff you know? ..Triumph: I'm at 50 days today! I managed to go out dancing the other night sober. I didn't stay long but the fact that I managed to do it at all speaks volumes about my growth process. ..General: I found a diary entry from when I was about seventeen that reads "I don't like drinking. But I like being drunk...I think it's the crudest way to achieve mindlessness." .How sad yet true little 17 year-old me. 
is it bad I want to go find a can of peaches now and tuck in?
**Struggle:**     I'm realizing more and more how mean and heartless my sister is...**Triumph:**     Hosted 15 people for Father's Day with zero help from anyone. Am I too old school when I think that maybe one of the ladies would help out??...**General:**     I'm up one size since losing all my booze weight. Back to my ACV diet and it's absolutely amazing how great this stuff is!.
**Struggle:** My weight has started to creep back up due to eating too much sugary food as a supper during the evening. I had a new Day 1 yesterday.....**Triumph:** 900!..**General:** I'm taking The Manic Street Preachers on a tour of rural England. If they tolerate Diss then the Chilterns will be next...
**Struggle:** I'm getting packed up and ready for our week long camping trip with my husband's family next week. It's still hard for me to not associate camping with drinking beer all day and I'm having a little anxiety over it. But I made it through last year I know I can do it again. ..**Triumph:** I'm non-celiac gluten sensitive! After months of struggling to figure out why my gut was so unhappy all of the sudden I think my issues have finally been solved. It kind of sucks that I have to be extra vigilant about what I eat now but I'm so relieved to be starting to feel normal again :) ..**General:** The peppers I planted are growing like crazy! I never had much luck with them in the past but this years plants are loaded. Now they just need to hold off on getting ripe until we get back from vacation so we can actually eat them. 
Struggle: The family staying with me drinks. A lot. ..Triumph: I took them to the liquor store and they didn't buy anything (I'm the chauffer)
Love WUW!.Struggle:  Returned to the year-round home from the up-north home to find that the garden-care person I'd hired had done nothing in one month. Fortunately there has been enough rain that nothing died. I'm not sleeping well unusual for me and my normally on-track eating is not on track at the moment. .Triumph: Not drinking!!! Not even feeling close! Asking what happened rather than just going off on the garden person. Weeding despite the heat. Noting that wacko eating and no yoga days have gone together I'm taking time for my full practice this morning. .General:  I'm feeling incredibly grateful to be alcohol free.  I'm super happy with the progress I've made on the up north house lawn and plantings. Gardening and mowing with a walk-behind battery powered  mower that I can set to an aerobic pace for me are my new still fun summer gym activities.  I'm fortunate to be able to go back for more very soon. 
**Triumph:** It's been a while since I bitched about work stress here...**Struggle:** Work stress. My soft relaxed period is over and it's time to crank. I have to practice being efficient again and work on boundaries to keep work and family separate...**General:** I built a sandbox for the kids this weekend. They love it. Unfortunately it feels like sand is coming into the house faster than I moved it into the box by the wheelbarrow-full.
T:  I went on a trip for a week and it was absolutely transformational. Sort of a basic road trip saw some cool stuff some of it new some not but I feel like it rewired my brain a little bit. ...S:  At the moment a lot of the anxiety and worry I always carried just seems to be gone. But I am having some trouble getting back to work and back on the path toward my goals. ...G: I was dating someone but it got too serious too fast and that kind of killed it for me. I'm just so used to being on my own it seems damn near impossible to adjust to anything else. I am fine with that. I'm sure in the near future I will be complaining about being lonely again but for right now I feel great. 
Mary your village sounds just like my little town. Going anywhere even just walking Kiddo to school means running into people. Some days that's all a bit much :)..Struggle: I'm really  deeply disturbed by some things going on in the world and I can't ignore a lot of them as they are part of the context of some of my work. Feeling it all and not switching off with alcohol is a real challenge right now...Triumph: It is the month of All the Big Bills - power and car registration and insurance as well as the usual phone and credit card - and for the first time in years I do not have to dip into my much-diminished savings or use the credit card to pay any of them. I actually have the cash. Partly due to not drinking partly due to having a good flow of well-paid work now on top of my badly paid but time-consuming one. Probably having the well-paid gigs working out is also a benefit of not drinking :)..General: DAMN my house is cold! It has no heating to the bedrooms my office is very cold as it is full of drafts at floor level and not insulated [added a small radiator but it only raises the temp a few degrees so my hands don't go blue while typing] and the kitchen is so cold I use the oven pretty much every night to make it warmish enough to sit and eat in. Yes even soup can be cooked in an oven :) Losing the drinking weight means I am feeling the cold a lot more this year! [but I wouldn't trade it for having the drinking weight back!!].
S: stress and anxiety from work is horrible still. Spoke with my former employer about returning but they were non committal. Now I feel trapped because of all my bills. ..T: 30 days without alcohol in a stressful situation. Seeing a therapist and just got medication. I can take 6 weeks off work in a fee months for parental leave. ..G: really wish I could enjoy this summer more. I'm grateful for what I have but feel i can't enjoy it. 
Struggle: Suffering from the side effects of my new MS medication and dealing with the pain of my MS that used to go away when I was drunk...Triumph: Being sober so I can be on the MS drugs and hopefully prevent future relapses...General: I really need to get rid of these headaches! The other side effects have calmed down but having a constant headache for almost 2 weeks has made it almost impossible to get anything done. I'm keeping the kids alive and the dishes done at least!
**Triumph:**  I'm starting to see progress in therapy!..**Struggle:**  Dating is a pain in the ass. Necessary if I want to meet someone but a pain in the ass...**General:** I've been getting into Overwatch lately and that is one hell of a game. I finally can enter competitive matches and even though I'm terrible it's pretty fun.
Struggle: I struggle with a desire to drink when I am home alone with my baby. I think it is a combination of the shame I feel when drinking so I do it when no one is around and a desire to get out of my head and anxieties...Triumph: By not drinking I know when I wake up in the morning I'm going to feel so much better than after a night of drinking. That extra energy in the morning gives me the ability to live a life that I am proud of - showing my wife and son love and leaving the world better than I found it...General: I feel so much love from my family my wife my dog and my son. I want to do right by them and show them the love they deserve.
Struggle: I'm spending the day with my partner's dad and grandma. His dad scares the fuck out of me and gives me panic attacks because he is so whacked out on speed and has ptsd. I know I should have more compassion towards him back he goes around screaming military lingo for know reason and it mostly jist freaks me out. Also after i heard him make loose plans to kill his ex wife's new boyfriend i just cant be around him. He is a scary dude...Triumph: I did nothing on my day off yesterday for once and god damn did it feel good to let go for a bit and just be super lazy and be okay with it...General: One of my childhood friends is having a wedfing in less than a month up in our home town and while I'm super stoked to see la familia again and hang out in my old stomping grounds i know most of my old friends are active heavy drinkers/drug abusers and while that was great when I'd see them when I was still using/drinking now I'm a little worried about mixing with them sober.
**Struggle:**  My GF has a tendency to be very judgmental of people she doesn't understand and quite a few of my friends fall into that category.  On the other hand she can be extremely helpful and generous to my friends.  I *hate* how she is derogatory about my friends to me and passes instant judgment on them.  It's one of her biggest traits that has me questioning the longevity of our relationship.  She is awesome in a lot of ways but this is really painful for me and she just refuses to look at it.  We got in a big fight over it this morning but she thinks the focus of our disagreement is elsewhere.  I don't know how to convey more clearly to her that I'm reacting to her disregard of my friends within the topic of discussion rather than the topic itself.  Makes me feel yucky and doubt my relationship choice...**Triumph:**  Even doing lazy keto I'm seeing progress!  And excited for a backpacking trip this weekend in Rocky Mt. National Park yay!..**General:**  I asked for a few leftover plants if there were any from GF's job's plant sale.  I ended up with FORTY FIVE perennials!  And now I have a new project that will last through the fall!  Yeesh.  Can't just kill 'em though.  
Struggle: I'm trying to find housing for my last college semester and it's proving somewhat stressful. Especially housing with people who are supportive. It's hard to find. ..Triumph: This is the longest period of time I've been sober for a while and I think it's because I finally realized that I don't need alcohol to have fun or appear cool...General: I have one college semester left and I think my life is going to be cool after college though I'm not sure what I'll be doing exactly. I know I'll figure it out.
Struggle: I took the classes (again) passed the exam (again) but I'm still terrified to actually go and purchase a car. I'm 37 and driving has always seemed to elude me. I'm determined to not let this fall wayside again. I need to drive to keep moving forward literally and figuratively in life!!..Triumph: Ran my third full marathon in 3:53 at 530 days sober!!! Fun coincidence eh?! I've never been this healthy and happy in my life. It's wild to me. ..General: I'm not the thinnest I've ever been but I'm the strongest. I also chopped off all my hair into a pixie cut. I feel like I'm really transforming in all sorts of ways. It feels so good. All my hard work on my sobriety and mental health has been paying off and it feels extremely validating..
struggle: none really. maybe the frustration that I am working with is that most people tell me how they don't have a drinking problem. starting with my sister. everyone around me drinks in moderation everyone enjoys alcohol and is NOT an alcoholic as they tell me. ok fine..triumph: general excitement about life and feeling powerful and invincible..general: I feel like I'm in Inside Out movie. Memories of fun times not all of them many of them are turning half black as I realize how much alcohol influenced what I did or what happened to me. I feel sad for younger me I feel just so much sadness. reading on how exactly the alcohol addiction is formed over years and recognizing myself in every step I am scared too. ..IWNDWYT 
**Struggle:** I'm having a hard time telling my husband about what I'm doing. He's always supportive and wants the best for me but it's hard to admit to someone that I love SO MUCH that I am struggling so much...**Triumph:** I've been going to the gym pretty consistently for 4 months now and have lost quite a bit of weight. Now that I'm not drinking I'm excited about increasing my strength and endurance!..**General:** I got a 2 week supply of La Croix at the grocery store and it was on sale. Setting myself up for success is key and I'm excited to really experience my life now!
**Struggle:**Taking care of my health is incredibly time-consuming. I had a life-altering surgery (for the best) just three days ago and already I've had to run after insurance papers bills etc. This one was sorta easy since it was a laparoscopic surgery so I had minimal pain and interruptions... But next month there's a jaw surgery waiting for me. At least I'll get to eat ALL. THE. ICE CREAM...**Triumph:**My body healed superbly fast even though I've been clean for just almost-60 days. It's only day 4 of the post-op process and I'm already back to my normal life only not allowed to lift weights. Last time I had any sort of surgery I had major issues with the healing process which later turned out to be from alcohol/drug abuse. My body feels amazing and I'm very thankful that my weekend googling was "best fruit for healing" instead of the usual "can you mix cephalexin and alcohol?"..**General:**Can't wait to heal completely so I can go back to walking my dog. We always spend the whole day together but I really miss the extra bonding we get from our nightly neighborhood exploration. At least we can still play fetch to our heart's content!
S: yesterday went for dinner with family on our holiday. Schnapps and beer were served. I said no to the waiter reply was "why?" and I was served anyway..Could easily give it away though...T: I stopped quit rapidly. The idea was planted 3 weeks ago. However we're on a big holiday now planned to stop afterwards. But I've already quit and it has been relatively easy so far! And super happy about it..The super happy feelings are wearing off a bit it's becoming more normal. ..G: first nightmare last night. Dreamt that I accidentally drank a beer. When I became intoxicated I panicked. Then I realised it was a dream.
