I made it through a week! Yay! I've never had a drinking dream before... But this one was really intense. ..I was reading my mom's Big Book the other night (I have my own but I like using hers... My fav times with her was when she was sober so using her book to get sober is helpful for me) and came across the story of the guy who relapses with whiskey in milk. ..For those not familiar with the story: He lost nearly everything to drinking and is on the brink of definitely losing his family and what's left of his career if he continues to drink. He is doing business and stops at a restaurant and gets a meal where he's avoided alcohol many times before. That day however the alcoholic bug in his brain convinced him that he could handle one ounce of whiskey in a glass of milk on a full stomach. That if he drank under those conditions he'd somehow over come his problem. So he has another and another. ..We all know what goes on from there. ..This really encapsulates my current relapse. I keep searching for that perfect buzz... I almost have a nostalgia for it. When drinking was still fun when I could stop or when my life was manageable. I had a dream I was out to dinner with some friends/colleagues and took 'just one' shot with them which led to an entire night of me ordering drinks for people getting too drunk and paying a $600 bill (rather precise number for a dream). ..I woke up and thought it had happened. I was ashamed because I had drank again and spent so much money. That I wouldn't have enough money for my boyfriend's birthday (which is today!) because I had blown it on alcohol...When I finally sorted through my thoughts I realized I was in bed not hung over and it was nothing but a nightmare. I need to be vigilant in making sure this nightmare doesn't come true! ..Tomorrow my boyfriend and I are going bowling with his friends for his birthday. There is a bar here and most people drink. Not to excess (well my definition of excess...) but it will still be my first night out 'explaining' why I'm not drinking. I'm usually the first person with a drink and the last person finishing one so this is unusual. However I have a few things to 'ease into' my social life as a non-drinker without sacraficing my anonymity. Unfortunately the ugly stigma associated with addiction is so deep-rooted that it is difficult for me to take my usual 'fuck it. either they like me or they don't!' stance on things. ..For this specific event I'm going to be the DD. It's my boyfriend's birthday so I'll be driving his truck which is a great reason to not drink. Also this will be my first time seeing this group of people since my mom passed so if someone asks (which I doubt they will) why I won't have 'just one' I'll let them know that even one can turn me into an emotional bubbling mess (I just leave out the part about drinking 25 more) so under the circumstances I'll stick to club soda and lime. ..Thanks for listening guys. Have a great and sober day! ..

Dreams are just dreams. A lot of times I drempt about alcohol when I first sobered up because that's what I was thinking about during the day. They really don't have any significance at all. When I played tetris for a long time I'd be seeing those blocks in my sleep for days...I would recommend against going to something social with alcohol that early in sobriety. When I did that in my first few months of getting sober I barely managed to stay away from alcohol. However I was miserable at every single event I went to...That doesn't last forever though once I sat down to understand why I drank the way I did (hint: it had little to do with the alcohol itself) I find I can have fun around people who drink now. In early sobriety there were too many uncontrollable and unknown factors for me to simply have a good time not obsessing over alcohol which didn't go away until I took some sort of inventory on myself...My recommendation? For the time being do something special for your boyfriend for his birthday that isn't around any alcohol. Missing one night of bowling with his friends in favor of something else shouldn't really bug him too much. In fact his friends will probably think you're the cool girlfriend for not having to always tag along when they're hanging out. This is just my suggestion though and you have to do what you feel is right for you.
Nice update!  Did you ever see any of comments on drinking dreams?  There's a link that I share that sort of explains (at least for me) why we have them.  The good news is that they fade pretty damn quick.
