Today I am 40 days sober and that's cool but I've been here before. It's not all that new to me. I really want to hit 100 days sober so I have to stay focused on that and not rest on my laurels. A big reason why I relapsed in the past after 50 days or so is because I would say to myself ''you've been a good boy for 50 days go celebrate! One night won't hurt!''..So I have to stay the course and stay focus and not fall into that trap again. I really want to hit those triple digits: 100 days sober.  That's when I'll know I really have come a long way compared to how I was before. Honestly I really do not want to drink and then have to start from 0 again. What I have noticed is that binge drinking just once is enough to make me anxious depressed tired and sluggish for an entire week seriously. It's not worth it at all.

I'm rooting for you!  IWNDWYT I did one day at a time and suddenly my badge had grown.. it does that!  
If you read your post title in an Australian accent it rhymes!
Interesting tidbit on the Century mark from my experience- at that point of my journey it felt like just another day. ..I thought I was going to celebrate somehow but around day 80 or so I stopped clock watching. ..The choice of sobriety just becomes a daily occurrence rather than a continuum.  ..Hope that makes sense?
