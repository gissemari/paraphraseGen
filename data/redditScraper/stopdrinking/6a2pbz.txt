I'm having a hard time figuring out what sober people do together. I'm realizing that without alcohol I struggle to make new friends. .What are things that you do with your sober friends? Stuff besides going out to eat and coffee- I love going on walks so I've got that one in the bag! Haha! .

Everything! Your life is open. What do you want to do? ..Long walks? Start playing golf. It is a lot of fun relaxing and frustrating and a GREAT way to hang out with people...Take a course. Go to the local College and start the road to a degree...Best bet? Hang out with sober people. They are super easy to find at meetings...
Running or cycling. There are always group events in my area...You'll meet people and get healthy. Win/Win!
