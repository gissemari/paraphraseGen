I have been on this sub for awhile.  Ten days here three days there.  One of the things I have struggled with is how to tell people that I won't be drinking.  Not wanting to admit to having a problem not wanting to lie.  I know I know most people don't care and I have been blowing it up in my mind.  But there it is.  Well I went to the doctor who told me that my lifelong genetic high cholesterol needs to be addressed and has prescribed a statin.  I said - hey you can't have alcohol with that.  And she said and I quote "Well if you are looking for a reason to quit . . ."  Whoa.  Boom.  Why yes in fact I am looking for a good non-debatable reason to give my friends when they say why aren't you drinking.  To create instant accountability I immediately told my husband I am starting a statin today.  And I am going to tell everyone.  I feel so relieved - like a big barrier to my sobriety has been lifted.  Thank you god and thank you all of you on this sub.  You have kept me going through all of my many many resets in the past eight months!

It's amazing the mental machinations that we put ourselves through when life could be so much simpler. ..Good luck kiddo..IWNDWYT 
Glad that works for you!
Awesome! I still haven't told a soul outside SD and my therapist. Glad you found a way to ease into it! IWNDWYT 
That's what I tell people - that I'm on meds that don't mix with alcohol.  Which is true.
