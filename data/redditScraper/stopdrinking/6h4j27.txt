[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy Hump Day! What's Up Wednesdays are when we celebrate our sobriety see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** I am staying in my mother's little village in the Adirondack Mountains and people there haven't seen me since I quit. Apparently several people have commented to my mother  Mary looks great! And so *healthy! *..**Struggle:** Some people in the village seem to feel that they have to defend their drinking to me. One person said  My doctor said I drink too much but I have to have *some* way to relax right?  Another said  I'm doing keto and I'm not supposed to drink but I mix my vodka with water. That's good enough right?  I just start talking about something else. The truth is that if they want my help in quitting I am happy to give it but otherwise I really don't want to hear about it.. . **General:** They have Adirondack seltzer water at the grocery store in town. Delicious and I think the [label](http://i.imgur.com/W5AvbCo.png) is so pretty!.
----------immediate responses--------

It's been a hell of a day today. Someone got into an altercation at work and brought a gun into the facility... My partner's grandfather has passed away. I've been doing a lot of emotional supporting. ..But I would not be nearly as present if I was drinking. I feel strong.
I am feeling committed and strong. I do not want to drink and I am armed with reason *why* I don't...But these cravings suck. Anyone have any suggestions? I
Triumph: I have been going to meetings daily and will continue to do so. Years ago I never invested into the program and only went to appease the powers that be. I'd just take a chair in the back and zone out. This time is different because I'm actually meeting people getting numbers and talking. I finally found a therapist that not only gets me but that I am comfortable talking to about my schizoaffective disorder personal issues depression addiction and alcoholism...Struggle: I am 5 days sober and my timer on this subreddit says 1 day. I am too lazy to fix that...General: I think I've consumed as much meeting coffee on top of coffee shop coffee in the past 5 days as I did alcohol in the 5 days preceding that.
Triumph:  My oldest son is home for the summer!!!  He is such an awesome person &amp; we have talked laughed &amp; just generally enjoyed having him here so much already.  Last night the discussion ranged from Chinese politicians from the 30s to how many plastic surgeries Papa John has had.  There is never a dull moment when he is here.  I love being sober &amp; present so much in these precious moments...Struggle: I need to work on my patience with my little boys.  Last night they were running wild as two year old boys should &amp; I felt that old familiar "you need to relax with alcohol when they go to bed" creep back up.  No ma'am- I certainly do not. ..General: I'm interested in trying something new when it comes to exercise. Any ideas for training that I can do at home would be most appreciated.  Currently half-assing yoga 3 times a week.
Haven't done one these yet but here it goes! ..Triumph: Today I forced myself to wake up at a (somewhat) normal hour. As tired as I was I went and bought building supplies and built a patio! I'm not a super handyman but it turned out much better than expected. Got a huge sense of accomplishment compared to just spending the day getting drunk and disregarding all the things I should be doing. Finished the patio and made myself dinner having a bath than heading to bed. ..Struggle: Lately been having awful sleeps. Don't fall asleep until 4-5 in the morning and when I finally do the sleep is terrible. Last night I had sleep paralysis and it absolutely scared the shit out of me. Found out I'm vitamin B12 deficient which would explain why I'm so tired since quitting drinking. When I was drinking I assume I never noticed because I was either drinking/drunk or just figured I was tired and had no energy from drinking/being drunk. ..General: Things are looking up for me. Especially after today. Felt such a sense of accomplishment building something and finishing it without having a drink during/after. Hell if I was to try drinking while building something it would never get finished.  I'd just end up completely wasted instead. Going to do more tomorrow even if it's just simple stuff like laundry and dishes. Have to put another coat of paint on the deck so that'll keep me busy for a while. 
I'm cheating because it's still Tuesday here... oh well...Triumph: I went to my first AA meeting in a very long time today. Also I opened up to my friends about a lot of what's going on with me this weekend which was well received and felt like a really positive step...Struggle: I can *still* feel the physical effects of binging on Saturday. And a crick in my neck from laying on the couch the entire day Sunday binge watching TV feeling sorry for myself. I can't believe I used to do that literally every weekend. And I'm still coming to terms with being an alcoholic. Specifically the sharp contrast between the support expressed at places like this one and the stigma placed on struggling with alcohol in "regular" social circles. ..General: Bought some super strong ginger beer in the organic section of the store just now... holy crap it's now my favorite thing.
Glad you're getting all those lovely compliments in the Adirondacks u/sfgirlmary! Oh how I miss skiing up there. That water rocks :)...Triumph:     Date with K went beautifully. I'm going back up there this weekend...Struggle:     My sister threw a fit today when I told her that I need one single day off from Mom's dialysis duty. Guess what sis? I'm a bit tired of being home to be Mom's caretaker 24/7 365. It's time for you to step up and give me some breathing room. Don't you want to see me happy?!..General:     Sunday will be tough for me. My Dad died while I held him in my arms 12 years ago on Father's Day. He was only 57. He would love to see me sober and he would be so happy about my relationship with K. I love you Daddy!! .
Triumph: Day 11 of sobriety...Struggle: work is just a depressing and an unappreciated slog (again) today. I'm tired and achey didn't sleep too well. When I'm like this my go-to emotion is anger/crankiness. Usually I would respond to this emotion with a reward of buying a bottle (or two) of wine on the way home. Just drink to forget for a while. Will make another coffee now instead. I will not drink with you today.
**T:**  My ex has been back in town and has been staying at my house.  I've established boundaries and I'm not wavering from them...**S:**  She wasn't welcomed to stay here but I've let her for my daughter's sake.  I can't let her stay here anymore because it's too difficult to have her here.  I'm afraid that I'm going to have to get the police involved.  And I'm not looking forward to that...**G:**  I can't believe I used to live like this for years with her slamming vodka like water so I can handle this I've been through worse much worse.
Triumph: I just came home after a weekend with a friend in the mountains and two day stint in the capital for meetings. Not only did I never crave a drink I was fine with everyone else indulging around me!..Struggle: Work hasn't been easy and it's been weighing me down. Only 2.5 weeks left of school and then I can finally take a breather...General: I might be moving over the summer. Not certain yet though..I'm not drinking with any of you today!
Triumph: Finished writing an article mostly pleased with it. If I'd been drinking the night before I would probably be procrastinating and telling myself I'm a shit writer ..Struggle: worrying about friendships and whether they are based around drinking. and worrying about what i'm eating seem to be craving more sugary things. ..General: Started playing the new (ish) Tomb Raider 
Triumph - I'm still sober and start putting my fence up tomorrow am ..Struggle - I haven't been this lonely in a long time. It's been near a month since my wife left and with my mental and physical conditions it's hard for me to get out to meet people. I get to thinking I'm doomed to a life of loneliness...General - I will not drink with any of you today  
**Triumph**: I am getting kept on at my job and its a great job at that. After almost 4 years working for people who actively went out there way to make me feel miserable I actually feel like I am part of a team and my work is respected. Amazing...**Struggle**: It's my birthday weekend away next weekend and I am being super vigilant. My mind keeps trying to play tricks on me but I know if I get through this then I will be stronger down the line...**General**: I went to Iceland for a long weekend and it was magical. I also nearly lost my boots over Iceland's second highest waterfall but thankfully managed to save them. Adventure!
**Triumph:** Business is going from strength to strength at present. I'm currently having easily my best year since I began trading 5 years ago. ..**Struggle:** Lack of caffiene. I started getting anxiety attacks a couple of weeks ago which used to show approximately 30 minutes after drinking a cup of coffee. The attacks have gone but so has some of my alertness.....**General:** My village doesn't have it's own water brand but like many places it does have it's own brewery (which I used to brew in many moons ago).
Triumph: This is the first day in at least 6 months I've woken up without a hangover! Great feeling...Struggle: How to fill the day without alcohol and how to resist the 'I feel OK now I've got it under control I'll just have a couple of glasses of wine tonight' self delusional thoughts. 
I'm glad you're getting so many compliments! I think many people are sensitive about their drinkingz I know I used to be and that's why I would make comments like those. ..Triumph: I'm closing on my first home in a couple days...Struggle: Sometimes I miss drinking still...General: I've got to stop getting into twitter funds with people :P
Triumph: 8 days without ethanol or caffeine...Struggle: work stress...General: reading a book about mindfullness by Sam Harris and am becoming pretty fascinated by it. 
Thanks for posting I really needed this today...Triumph: 5 months sober woo! ..Struggle: I took on a new project at work as Project Manager and I'm struggling a lot. I hate having to talk / coordinate with people- I do a lot better when I can just work by myself and that's not project management at all. I took this b/c I thought it would be good to get outside my comfort zone and look good for my performance review- I didn't realize it would be this hard...General: The dog next door to me isn't barking as much. Hooray!
[removed]
Triumph: I found two mini bottles of peppermint vodka in my freezer yesterday and threw them away...Struggle: Finding two mini bottles of peppermint vodka in my freezer yesterday. I wanted to drink them both. Also I know my birthday weekend is just a few days away when I usually celebrate by getting wasted...General: Things are going good and I am feeling great now. I still keep having thoughts of how nice it would be to have a double rum and diet coke but that would be followed by 6 more double rum and diet cokes.
Trimph: Quitting drinking is giving me more time and mental energy to focus on positive growth in other areas I'm spending more time reading working on my DBT book getting outside and just thinking more clearly and having more stable emotions..Struggle: There are a bunch of events coming up which I would like to go to if I was still drinking but I don't feel ready to put myself in those environments yet so I still need to find some evening/social activities not involving drinking. .General: Feeling hopeful about the future and opportunities that may open to be that I will be able to meet!
**Triumph:** By this point in the week my bank account would be empty and I'd buy alcohol with a credit card that's almost maxed out. The money not spent on alcohol can go towards paying down that balance...**Struggle:** Sleep has been difficult (nightmares nightsweats). Instead of being hung over I'm tired...**General:** I have band practice tonight. What used to be rehearsal twice a week has become drinking and smoking in the garage once a month. Today I'm trying to quit smoking so I may have to revisit this whole "band practice" thing. 
One more triumph: Shared with friends and coworkers that I am finally going to try quitting completely (instead of moderating) and everyone was super supportive and understood. ..When I hear some people talking about their "friends" still pressuring them to drink it just has me smh. I feel lucky that so far I haven't encountered that..
On Day 2 here. After a major slip up this weekend feeling like my body is finally getting back on track...Struggling already worrying about this weekend: lots of once a year summer activities in town that revolve around alcohol happening.
Triumph: I am less angry at my ex- today. (My exes). .Struggle: I know how to work a program and yet I choose to stay in my resentments.... will I choose to drink or drug next? Probably not - but I can be miserable for decades.....General: Hope to resolve financial fighting with the ex over my grown disabled daughter's care and monetary needs. (You can't imagine the lawyers' fees.).
Triumph: Weekends with my grandkids have been really great lately. I've been working on being patient and more engaged with them and it's making such a difference. I love letting my inner child free and playing with them :) ..Struggle: I can think myself right into a dark mood sometimes that sticks with me for days. Yesterday was one of those days and I'm trying to not let it linger. I know I can lift myself out of it just wish I didn't bring myself down in the first place. ..General: I take Adirondack soda for granted it's the cheap stuff around here like $1 for a two liter. I usually opt for Polar because they have more flavors but Adirondack is a solid seltzer choice :) 
**Triumph:** I've found my calm center again and I've been staying there more often than not. If you've every been to Yellowstone I'm being more like one of the [mud pots and just bubbling along](http://i.makeagif.com/media/2-20-2015/vKMS-9.gif) than a [geyser's eruption](https://media.giphy.com/media/hRgK9Oe2FnECk/giphy.gif)...**Struggle:** Yesterday was rough. A friend is struggling with his recovery and been isolating from our circle of sober friends. Another friend is dealing with complications from a car accident. A third found out that her lymphatic system is riddled with tumors. Left me feeling pretty raw and buffeted last night...**Seltzer:** I picked up a box of [DRY Sparkling](http://www.drysparkling.com/) from Costco. Lightly sweetened without being soda-sweet and a gentler carbonation than La Croix. I think it will be a nice occasional alternative to the gold standard of Pamplemousse.
Struggle: My mother who drinks beer every single night without exception is planning to come stay the night at my apartment for some mother daughter "girl time". We're very close and also drinking buddies. These nights always involve alcohol--Miller lite for her wine for me. Part of my brain is trying to convince me that it'll be fine to just have a few glasses tonight and pick it up tomorrow. I have contemplated asking her to not bring beer. I'm not really sure what I'm going to do...Triumph: the guy I've been seeing has suddenly stopped texting and calling me for seemingly no reason which kind of makes me feel crappy about myself. I had suuuch a strong craving last night that I almost stopped for some liquor on my way home but instead I put my ear buds in and went for a 2 mile run. I'm super out of shape right now and this morning can barely walk but I'm really proud of myself for not giving in. I've finished TNM in 2 days although I need to go back and reread some of it to make sure I've absorbed all of the information. It's my day off today I have no hangover and I'm going to spend the day relaxing in the sun and getting some household chores done!
Triumph:  I didn't drink yesterday sort of. .Struggle:  I finished a rather stressful week of travel and felt like I needed to toast to my success with a small glass of wine. I thought I could try and be a moderate drinker. The glass of wine was poured and in front of me as my family and I sat around the table to eat. I took a tiny sip and it was gross. I was flooded with reminders of how wine ignites my fury while extinguishing my senses and ultimately my joy. I poured a glass of soda water over it to dilute it and took another sip. Same effect. So I poured it out and got water instead and decided it's just not worth it.  However sobriety continues to cause me a great deal of anxiety because the majority of my mom friends drink when they gather. How do I continue to gather with them without making them feel awkward for their own drinking?  They can do whatever they want. It's just not for me. .General:  confession...I replaced the evening glass of wine in my hand with a fidget spinner. Don't judge me...it works  
Triumph: Still sober and I applied for and got an opportunity I worked for. ..Struggle: I'm starting to get bored and frustrated. I don't want to drink but I am grumpy. It feels like getting through these first few weeks is taking forever and I'm always anxious and I still get cravings..General: I'm keeping myself busy and I've done more in the past two weeks sober than I ever do in a few months when I'm drunk
Triumph: Once again I haven't killed anyone. ..Struggle: The reason my triumph is that I haven't killed anyone is because I spent half of my one night a week I get away from my kids for 2 hours refereeing between my 22 y/o and my 12 y/o. I just want 2 hours out with my friends playing trivia but they spent half the time blowing up my phone because they were arguing. I'm so sick of it. So so sick of it. I am not happy with this situation and I need to figure out how to sort it out and I'm tired of always being the one to sort it out. ..General: The not drinking thing is going pretty well. Sometimes I think about it - like last night at trivia - but then I think "You know you can't just have ONE beer. It's never just ONE. So just don't have any. Enjoy the seltzer and think about how nice you'll feel in the morning." 
**Triumph:** I'm sleeping much more soundly and without the help of sleep aids. ..**Struggle:** Boredom. ..**General:** Tso's chicken is pretty good.
I still get lonely sometimes. It's pretty natural and I understand it better than when I was drinking but it still kind of sucks sometimes. Fizzy water has been great for me. Climbing and cooking have really helped. I've been losing weight much faster than when I drank and I've actually felt like I could ask someone out and handle someone saying no. Overall I'd say I'm doing pretty well thus far...I won't drink with you all today!
Thank you for your comment!  . Mommies drinking together has been going on for so many generations that it's no wonder it's become ingrained in our culture. My mom recalls her mom getting together every other day to "play cards" with her friends which was really code for drinking. I don't remember ever seeing my own mother drunk or heading off to drink wine with her friends. She didn't have very many friends though from what I remember and I wonder if that's because she wasn't or didn't want to be part of that culture. I didn't want to be friendless and it seems that the majority of moms I've connected with have "wining" together as their bonding agent. My drinking had become worse over the last few years because of the current culture surrounding me and I need to figure out a different way to connect. I think I'll find that the non-drinkers are more healthy and happy. I just need to figure out where to find them  
Triumph: I met someone I might actually be able to date. It was unexpected. I had almost stopped thinking about those possibilities. It's still way too early to tell but worth mentioning. Of course.....Struggle:  will have to figure out the best way to address that I don't drink. Don't feel she needs the whole story right off the bat. That will scare her off. Don't want to lie either. Even saying "ah just doing it for health reasons" is fine for a stranger but maybe not for someone you're pursuing a potential relationship with. Also drinking really can make a first date more relaxing and comfortable so I'm regretting that I can't do that. And then SHE will feel weird about drinking...damn near makes me want to give up on the whole thing. But I'll figure it out...General: May daughter is going away for two weeks soon and I am still trying to figure out what to do with myself when she is gone. It'll be the first time I don't take the opportunity to drink everything in sight and wallow in my misery. But I feel the need to do something to take my own little vacation. Might take a road trip that doesn't lead to New Orleans or Vegas. 
I really get a kick out of reading posts from people who have some long term sobriety under their belts. Thank you.
Triump: It was a shitty understaffed day at work yesterday but I came home and had a cup of Chamomile tea instead of 2 bottles of wine. (Sheldon Cooper's mom: "What do we do when people are upset?  Sheldon: "Offer them a hot beverage.")..Struggle: They cut everyone else's hours at work but gave me more. Sucks to get paid less than everyone else on the team...General: The weather is beautiful and I feel fine.
**Triumph:**  I'm staring down 300 days and looking forward to that nice round number.  I hope I can afford to get a massage on day 300.  I really could use one...**Struggle:**  I'm having trouble with self discipline and routine.  I would like to be studying for a big career exam at least 3 times a week and eating a healthier diet (I ate a whole package of cookies the other day) and why have I been smoking cigarettes occasionally?!  I was doing really well with all these things and then backslid recently.  Time to get on track...**General:**  It feels like summer will never truly come to the Northwest. I can't wait for hot days when I can go jump in the lake.
Beginning of my third day of sobriety. I haven't gone a day without drinking in...years. Feels very good but I'm nervous about a few things: I get paid tomorrow and I'm afraid I'll feel the whole "pocket is full gotta spend it on beer" way. Also I have some friends coming into town next week. I have a feeling sobriety is much easier when no one's asking you to go to the bar with them...
Triumph: a couple days in and feeling great. Got a lot done around the house yesterday.  Made it through my weekend. ..Struggle: My niece whom I take care of hasn't been sleeping at home. She's 18. I've tried talking with her and she assured me everything's ok with her. I'm really confused on how to handle this if she won't open up. Could be she's just obsessed with boyfriend. But I'm so worried about her. ..General: it's been 90+ F here and I love it. 
Triumph: I finished my Whole30 last week but am maintaining the same healthy eating 95% of the time. I am continuing to lose weight and feel and look better.  I even went to the gym this week!..Struggle: Staying focused at work has been really difficult lately.  I am waiting for my next project to get started and I'm having trouble getting all my BS paperwork I don't like to do completed. ..General: Not drinking feels like my default mode by now.  I still have occasional longings but it's just not something that's part of my life anymore. I feel mostly ok with that and happy that its been easier to maintain than I had feared.
Triumph: I pulled a girl's number yesterday and heard I would be a good fit for a position in shipping and receiving. I still haven't heard anything though so I think I'll call in a couple hours. I really need a job...Struggle: The struggle is that I am still looking for a job but I'm keeping my head up I'm just going broke haha. I really need to start making money!..General: We are halfway through the week and that's always good. Today I may take a day off from exercising as I've been doing doubles everyday and just relax a bit. We will see what the day brings though. I think I'm going to a meeting later today with my buddy it's a cool smaller meeting. 
in one week it will be 6 months since I quit devoting my life and time to alcohol!!! I feel so amazing and free. i finally feel that I have my life together and I'm loving it. I love myself i love my body I love enjoying my weekend's not hungover in bed waiting to feel better just so I can start drinking again. I love going to the gym I love taking pole dance classes I love the challenges that I face at work I love meeting new people. before when I was drinking I didn't love anything and never stepped outside of my comfort zone to try new things. my life has changed so much in these past 6 months and I will be forever grateful that I made the choice to live a healthy happy life. 
*Triumph*: Finally starting to find interests in sobriety. Back on the bass. Getting the finishing touches put on my race car and am going to track it next week. Lots of exciting stuff happening!..*Struggle*: Wife is out of town. Struggling to stay off of nicotine. Going back to all my old tools - taking it one day at a time urge surfing the whole bit. It's tough...*General*: Can't believe how much my life has turned around in sobriety. I've gone from borderline-homeless to getting a real estate agent and shopping for farmland. If everything goes according to plan by this time next year I might own my property outright and have a side software business up and running.
Triumph: 133 days and counting! Also getting every so slowly stronger in yoga. It's a slow process and is teaching me a whole lot of patience. ..Struggle: the joys and stresses of entrepreneurship. When I'm not sticking my head in the sand I'm in full stress freak out mode. I'd love to feel productive without being overwhelmed. ..General: my house is a mess and I'm in my head like crazy about business but going to yoga regularly and maintaining a decent level of self-care. 6/10
