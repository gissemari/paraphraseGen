Today I found myself in the company of some old friends. Ones I used to get drunk with and laugh and dance a couple of which I care for deeply as we are related through my marriage a marriage that is in abeyance right now. I could have said no and stayed home but my young kids were so happy that I joined them tonight. ..The drinks were flowing but I did not want to join my friends in drinking. The whole event was a little uncomfortable but bearable and my usual reward for not drinking with them would be drinking a bottle of wine when I got home...What's interesting about today is that I have recently decided that alcohol or abstinence should not define or rule me - that if one day I decide to have a drink or two that I will not punish myself it will not become a relapse it will just be an extraordinary day and then I will be ordinary again and continue not to drink. So truly anything could have happened......I am currently home in bed with my night time herbal tea and tv...I don't feel this was a success because I could just as easily have gone the other way - I just feel content that today I didn't drink - and for lots of reasons - the primary involving no hangover tomorrow and no bloatedness - I'm pleased :)
