So I relapse last week end But Sunday was the rock bottom again . I went 6 months sober so I know I could do it but the part of forgetting why I had got sober in the first place faded . I dint show  up to work yesterday . My wife said . Remember wen we left?  my kids would not talk to me . For today I won't drink . I'm going to try again. . If you are sober and think about drinking  !! not worth it! .

Sorry to hear that happened to you.  6 months is a great accomplishment.  Did you learn any strategies in that 6 months that will help you out this time?  I won't drink with you today!
Good news friend... you caught yourself. And you shouldn't have to deal with much physical withdrawal. Take what you learned and keep your head up.
