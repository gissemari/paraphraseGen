Many apologies for the long post!  I love reading about people celebrating and reflecting on their achievements - whether it's one day or a thousand days - and so I thought I'd throw my hat into the ring!...  **Three things I do**.  *Look after myself*.  I try to eat healthily exercise meditate and sleep enough every day.  I figure I can deal with whatever challenges come my way a thousand times better if I have gas in the tank...  *Dry people dry places*.  This is not always the easiest advice to follow but it's been crucial for me.  During my first run at sobriety I still went out to dart nights and wing nights and quiz nights and whatever other night was happening.  I didn't realize it at the time but the environment was wearing my resolve down and it was really only a matter of time until I drank again.  This time I'm replacing those nights with awesome fun activities during the day and I feel so much better for it...  *My sober state of consciousness is my best state of consciousness*.  From a very young age I've always been sought out highs; drugs alcohol sugar coffee . .whatever was going whatever would get me out of my head.  I thought that drugs made me more creative (they didn't) and that alcohol made me more social (it didn't).  I thought I needed something extra to be a better person when in reality everything I was doing was making me a shittier person. ...  **Three things I learned**.  *Support is important*.   I'm not a big sharer.  I went through a lot of therapy when I was younger and it wasn't very effective because I hate talking about myself and I especially hate talking about my problems but this sub has been a supportive and non-threatening environment in which I feel safe sharing my problems and my successes; writing things out has really helped me clarify my thoughts and reading everyone's advice and encouragement has been invaluable.  So if you're a lurker I'd encourage you to give posting a shot because it has worked wonders for me.. .  *I definitely have a drinking problem*.  It took some space from drinking and some long hard reflection before I could admit this to myself but doing so has allowed me to work unreservedly on my recovery.  ..  *That the tough times will pass*.  They suck and sometimes they can pop up so unexpectedly but the majority of problems are not the end of the world - and every time I struggle through them I gain a little more strength to face the next challenge....  **Three things that improved**.  *My relationships*.  This was a big one for me! My relationship with my fiance was on the rocks because of my selfishness and dishonesty and cheating.  Now - in her words - "everything is better."  We're getting married in a fortnight and I can't wait to carry on trying to be the best version of myself for her.  For the most part my relationships with my friends have improved as well.  So many people are going through struggles and this sub was really helped me open up and talk to people about them.  I have lost some drinking friends but that's a loss I'm willing to live with...  *My work*.  Before Sobriety (BS!) I was usually hungover or drunk at work.  I often passed out on my desk - really professional right? (And I don't know how I didn't get in trouble for that).  Now I look forward to Mondays my old BS nemesis.  I love my job so much more now which I reckon is pretty important because I'm there most of my waking life.  ..  *My mental health*.  I first tried to kill myself when I was 14 and have had desperate dreadful bouts of depression ever since.  But not any more.  I still have my down days for sure but I no longer fantasize about killing myself or walk to work hoping that a car will veer off the road and take my misery away. Words cannot describe how grateful I am for that....  I used to look at people with 100 days and think "WOW!  How the hell did they do that?  They must know EVERYTHING!"  But now I'm here I realize that I'm only at the beginning of my journey and I have so much more to learn.  Life is exciting and I'm so incredibly grateful to be experiencing it sober.

Hail new centurion!
What a great post! I remember how amazed at myself I was when I hit triple digits... it's such an amazing feeling!..I really like how you broke this down into the three categories: three things I do three things I learned three things that improved. If you see someone struggling on here you should definitely suggest they write these out. It's a great way to focus on the positive aspects of quitting drinking rather than how hard it can be. ..I'm so happy for you and keep up the great work! I look forward to reading more from you!
Totally awesome post. Wow!  Incredible what can happen in 100 days.
