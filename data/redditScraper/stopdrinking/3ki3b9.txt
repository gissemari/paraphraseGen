Well just like the title says I reset my badge. Two days ago I relapsed. I can't even say that I don't know how I got to the point of relapse I know exactly how. ..I was unable to accept that I am an alcoholic. I still struggle with it now. But it is hard for me to admit that I have something else that is "wrong" with me. I struggle with many mental illnesses and I guess I just need to be certain I truly and an alcoholic. ..Two nights ago I convinced myself that there was no way that I was an alcoholic with having such a short drinking career and having a family that thinks I don't have a problem. Within the past two days things have changed drastically. I have started to really work the we of the AA program. I have a sponsor I am doing 90 and 90 I am meeting with other AA members and talking to them and soon I will have a service position. ..I guess I still struggle with the first step bit I am working on it. I just need to remind myself what I really know deep down and that I am worth it. I am worth recovery and the steps of this program.

&gt;having a family that thinks I don't have a problem...That sucks I had this issue too my Mother insisted that I didn't have an issue because I was a happy drunk and well versed in how to hide the volume of my intake - I went out and proved my family wrong - I don't recommend that path.
