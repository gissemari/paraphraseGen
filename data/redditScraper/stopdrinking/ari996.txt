I am 46 days sober today and on February 13 I completed my final DUI class-conveniently on the one year anniversary of being arrested in the first place. ..All I have left are 4 mandated AA meetings one trip to the DMV $2000 in court fees and my final exit exam on Wednesday. ..Struggling mentally with my sobriety but I am happy with my progress.
