Oh my god I don't think I've ate this much in ages I already have a lot of weight to lose but I DIDN'T DRINK. It's been a hellish week and I'm scared of a few things but I made it...I am happy to be sober with you guys I was close to relapsing. My first goal is to make it to 30 days sober as I've never been 30 days sober in 10 years...Thanks y'all the best :)

Way to work this. Good job. I gladly won't drink with you tonight. 
If you can do 5 days you can do 30! You are a 6th of the way there already! Take it easy!
I won't drink with you today.  I might eat half a pint of ice cream though. :)
I also have a lot of weight to lose (100lbs from when I quit).  For the first month I let myself eat what I wanted as long as it kept me from drinking.  Eventually that evened out and I was able to start a good diet of mostly whole foods and lots of vegetables.  I've lost 30 lbs so far and a big part of that was not drinking empty calories every day and then eating garbage the next day to combat the hangover.  Take it easy on yourself I needed to break the drinking habit before I could even begin to address my diet.   Good luck you can do it!
Congrats.  In less than an hour I will have seven days.  I am striving for 30 days!  You can do it!
Well done. Keep drinking plenty of water to keep yourself hydrated. I often eat loads when I'm really just thirsty.
I was ravaging and had a huge sweet tooth initially. I felt it was a short term loss for a long term gain. I was putting down 1000-2000 calories some evenings so my body was obviously trying to feel that void. Keep it up!
My Klondike bar intake is definitely up. What wouldn't I do for a Klondike bar? Well drink. 
Eat all you want right now! You can worry about that later.
