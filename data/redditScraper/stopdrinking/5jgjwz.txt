https://imgur.com/a/JtKzF .I used to buy redness control primer to hide the redness on my face after a night of drinking.  Welllll it's certainly not needed for that anymore but it came in super handy today after a long cold bike ride. .Guys  it's been a struggle lately.  I'm on winter break and c'mon- holiday parties e'erywhere!! But I will not drink with you today!

Oooo I might have to try that primer! And I will definitely not be drinking with you! :)
Isn't it great how much better your skin gets after quitting? It's my fav part I swear I look ten years younger. Keep on truckin I will not drink with you today! .
