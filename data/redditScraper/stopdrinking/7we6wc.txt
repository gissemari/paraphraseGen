So yesterday was 2 weeks sober. Had a bad reaction to my medication which gave me real bad anxiety and it wouldn't subside. So the shitty part of my brain kicks in telling me I should go buy alcohol  not to get drunk but just to ease the anxiety . I literally have my keys in my hand and money in my pocket at the door when I call myself on my own bullshit...I had 15 minutes until the shop shut (no alcohol after 10pm in uk) and I had to sit down and force myself not to go and get it until the clock struck 10. Fuck I never realised what a grip it really had on me. I was rationalising it in every possible way  you haven't drank in 2 weeks a bit won't hurt it's for the anxiety etc  but I didn't drink! I powered through and distracted myself until the anxiety subsided. ..Unfortunately I did it by ordering pizza but I'll take having to go harder in the gym a few more days than waking up hungover/covered in blood/vomit/depressed...Thank you all &lt;3
