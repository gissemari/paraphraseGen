I realize my drinking problem is not their fault or responsibility. I had a boyfriend help keep me clean and sober for over year and a half of college by saying "I love you and it hurts me to see you hurt yourself." I don't want others to hurt just because I'm hurting myself. How do I make sure I don't demand too much emotional energy from others to keep me in check? I don't think I benefit too much from groups but I've only ever been in group when I was a teenager and most others were 30s-40s and AA isn't right for me. Should I try again? Or has anybody had productive experiences with CBT? Thank you for any advice you can offer.

I think therapy and groups would be a wonderful idea. Also what would it take to be able to say the thing your partner said but to yourself?.."I love you and it hurts me to see you hurt yourself."
