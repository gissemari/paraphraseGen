I failed. I kept my streak of non drinking up for...fuck I don't know whatever my counter says but I failed this weekend. Walked straight into my job and told them everything. My boss and my co workers were so supportive I started crying pretty much on the spot. They gave me a few days off and I'm just struggling to get past the next 24 hrs. Ya'll are great and I love each of you to pieces.

hey come and visit us in the chat room..Drinking after 68 days is not failure -- it is 68 days of success. As you succeeded before it is likely you will succeed again.
I lost count of how many times I tried and failed but at some point I think (hope) there comes a time where we know in our hearts that enough is enough.  Glad you're back with us.  Good luck in getting through this first week - we all know how rough it can be.  What supports will you have?
