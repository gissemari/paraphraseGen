I'm sorry for the post. I know it's hard for those of you able to stay sober to read things about people relapsing. But I am and it's helping me not want to take my gun to my temple so I'm not even mad at myself. I have gone longer than I ever have without drinking before this. I will get better. ..But tonight I'm taking that rented happiness.

I'm sorry you're struggling. As outlined in the community guidelines we ask that you only post when you have not been drinking. For this reason we had to remove your post. But we'll be here tomorrow if you want to come back then.
