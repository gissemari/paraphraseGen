I don't know if this is a common thing and I'm definitely not trying to be controversial but I had an experience where after I was finger-printed (etc) for my DUI I left and heard a song that has become tied to the entire experience and struggle I was facing. It's  One More Try  by George Michael. ..Even when I listen to it the memories of the whole early part of my experience come flooding back and I remember how cold hopeless and utterly fucked I was. Its become a useful tool for me but also just something that helped to lock in what I was feeling/thinking at the time...What's your DUI song?

I have mad respect for George Michael that's a good choice! My probably inappropriate recovery anthem is  Tubthumping' by Chumbawumba. * I get knocked down but I get up again! *   
So long as it's not  chain gang .   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zBn5aIfZElE
When I was in the transport bus going to jail on my 3rd DUI they were playing the radio. It was the first time I heard the song  In My Blood  by Shawn Mendes. It was rough.
