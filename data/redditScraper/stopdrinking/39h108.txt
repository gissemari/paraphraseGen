I struggled with the idea of quitting drinking for a really long time but one Saturday morning I woke up exceptionally hungover and had the house to myself so I decided to pour the rest of the wine into a massive glass roll myself a joint and headed out to my shed to go smoke it. As I was smoking the joint and drinking my pint size glass of wine my phone rang and it was someone from work asking me if I could head down to the office as there had been an alarm set off and she was out of town. I was in no shape to go down and talk to the police so I made up an excuse as to why I couldn't go. ..After I hung up the phone I started thinking about what she would think of me if she knew what I was really doing on a Saturday morning and it really struck a chord with me I was disgusted with myself...Eventually I ended up in therapy and came to the realization that I needed to quit drinking but there were so many things that came up and got in the way that would make it not an  ideal' time to quit. [I always had an excuse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd1ciPnTGKg). Finally I had enough and knew **I had to do whatever it takes to stop**. This meant doing things I didn't necessarily want to do like go to meetings when I was tired or didn't feel like it have awkward conversations with friends and family avoid the bar scene etc.....This quote from Randy Paush's *The Last Lecture* really helped motivate me to stop making excuses and start getting it done:..* The brick walls are there for a reason. The brick walls are not there to keep us out. The brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something. Because the brick walls are there to stop the people who don't want it badly enough. They're there to stop the other people. * .  Randy Pausch.. If you haven't seen [The Last Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo) before I highly recommend it. It's long but so amazing...Did anyone else come a similar realization?
