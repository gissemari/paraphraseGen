Hello fellow sobernauts. I haven't posted in a while but I'm checking in every day and my sobriety is still strong. Can't believe I'm on my 50th day today. Never thought I would make it this far. Thank you for all your advice and encouragement along the way - it has meant so much. ..But now I really need some advice. Despite working on something in my career for years - really hard to the point of it almost breaking me multiple times - I think I'm going to be hitting a brick wall soon. Like I will fail. Utterly and entirely. This means in effect that the last five years of my life will be essentially worthless. My heart has not been in it for a while so there's a touch of the inevitable about it but I'm still completely despondent about the idea of all that work for nothing. This is a major life failure and one I struggle to see myself coming back from. I will be back to square one. How will I cope with this? Having fucked up so royally of course I could see myself easily saying 'what's the point in *not* drinking?'. I'm really struggling to know how I will be able to stay strong. Any advice at all welcome x

What ever goes wrong dealing with it  will be more difficult if you are not sober.When I look back at my failures both personal and in business I actually learned alot.They were very disappointing and sometimes  heartbreaking at the time but as time passed I used the failures.It is never to late to restart.I am turning 60 and am starting a business with my son this spring.( and doing it sober! ) Good luck and deal with it sober I say.
I don't understand why last 5 years will be pointless? Can't you use that as work experience for something else?
I would really advise against drinking. Any sense of loss gets amplified and it takes longer (after you sober up again) to get your bearings.
