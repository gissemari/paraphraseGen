I'm going on my honeymoon in a week and a half and I'm afraid I'll relapse. ..We're going to Egypt which you would think would be dry but apparently the tourist areas have lots of booze. ..I have 121 days sober with the exception of taking a sip of a friend's drink a while back. I didn't even think about it and it tasted awful.  But that slip up scared me. ..Just needing to reach out. Thoughts?

My downward spiral starts with the first sip. Others around me can drink as they wish but my wish is to not drink today not in a week and a half and never again. Enjoy every minute of your sober honeymoon :) IWNDWYT
I was somehow deep into a search on here and saw your first post saying you had picked a quit date. ..&amp;#x200B;..Whenever I see those from a while ago I like to look at the user's posts to see if they stuck to it/how it's going. Rarely do I go on to find that someone has lost 25 lbs and is still on the wagon four months later - so first congrats on that I'm so happy for you :)..&amp;#x200B;..Also if you're still hanging on I think you've got what it takes to Honeymoon sober. Can your SO help make sure you stick to it?
