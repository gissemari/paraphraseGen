I posted yesterday and I appreciated everyone's thoughts and perspectives...Today is Day 2 and I'm already struggling more than I expected. I've given up alcohol a few times in the past couple of years but only for 30 days (pregnancy notwithstanding--and even then I drank small amounts sometimes). I expected the real challenge to kick in after 30 days when I accepted that this choice has become permanent. ..But I guess even in these early days the knowledge that I'm making a permanent change is starting to scare me. I still have a glass of wine in the fridge and a half-full bottle of wine from a couple night ago when I last drank. I should get rid of them but I can't bring myself to pour them down the drain. We have an Easter brunch with family this weekend and I keep thinking that I can just start my sobriety after it's over--but then it's always something isn't? A birthday an anniversary a special occasion? I know there is no reason to put it off...I'm already flitting with the idea that maybe I can give up alcohol temporarily and then come back to it when I have learned how to moderate. But I know that I will never be able to moderate. So why am I so stuck on this idea?..Today I feel more shame about being in recovery that I felt about drinking. But I know if I drink today that I will feel much more shame than I'm feeling now in a sober state...I don't think I have a physiologic dependence on alcohol but I know that would be my path if I keep drinking. I know that I use it as a crutch. I know that I self-mediate. I know how guilty and stupid I feel after I wake up from a black out. I know that I am healthier without it. I know that I have to do this...So why am I struggling so much today?..But regardless--I will not drink with you today.

You are struggling because it is early and it is a difficult transition...I am new at this too and most likely much older.  I have struggled with trying to drink moderately for years but even a glass of wine makes me what the entire bottle and more. It gets worse over time. ..Try not to put off the beginning of sobriety.  If the brunch is at your house offer your guests your wine.  If not.  Dump it...Considering I am only beginning Day 5 I am no expert but you made the decision.  Be strong and stick to it.  I truly wish I had last year or many years ago...I am doing a great deal of positive self talk and rehearsing how I will turn down a drink offers and handle party situations and other known social triggers.   ..I am also working on reversing my current mindset that believes every celebration requires alcohol.  It does not!  Especially when I think about what I missed because I was drunk or passed out and did not attend...*"Celebrate by offering the real me."*  That's my new plan...**I will not drink with you today**
A therapist and AA helped me learn how to build the life I have today. Going it alone was lonely.
