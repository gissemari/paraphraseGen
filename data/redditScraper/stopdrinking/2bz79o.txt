I've been reading this subreddit for months now. It reminds me of the reasons I need to stay sober. Thanks everyones who has been posting here and sharing their stories. ..Been sober now since mid March this year. Just requested a badge. In March i relapsed. Luckily it only lasted for one day only my normal habit has been to drink heavily for two to five days. I was a binge drinker but now i've decided that my drinking days are over. ..Before my relapse in March i had been sober since January. My serious attempts to stay completely sober started in January 2014. I've been going to AA meetings once a week also since January. ..I'm now 43 married and have two children. I have a company that I own together with my brother. I work at home without anyone supervising me. As you can imagine this freedom has provided me with good opportunities to drink. Despite my excess drinking my company is in good shape. I did more damage to my marriage but that aspect of my life is also improving every day as I stay sober. ..Sorry for the boring story :-) I'd be happy to write more about my drinking history if anyone is interested.
