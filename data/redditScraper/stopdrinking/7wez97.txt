After a relapse recently I took a couple days off work. I was feeling overwhelmed with school work and just life stuff that needs to be taken care of. I've got court for a dui next week and I haven't done shit to prepare for it. I am 3 weeks behind on assignments for a class that I need and genuinely enjoy. ..So I just took two days off work to focus. I haven't been doing anything and the more I don't do the more overwhelmed I feel. ..This morning I already called my lawyer I called my old high school to set up some observations for my class (super excited as it's not easy to get approved in this district!) called an old employer about a paycheck... I was going to throw away 250 bucks because I have been too lazy to care. and I am working on my homework. Today and this weekend I am GETTING THIS SHIT DONE. I am going to feel fucking good and the weight is going to be so much lighter. And I'm gonna do it all sober. I'm gonna take my dogs for a walk and I'm gonna love on them...Thanks for reading this. I'm just feeling good and I want to make myself accountable for doing these things TODAY not tomorrow or next week. Today.

Great so happy for you!
Good for you starting up a productive weekend. You're going to feel so good when you're done. I will not drink with you today.
I'm in school too and I know how hard it is balancing the act. What subjects are you taking? I'd love to help if possible.
