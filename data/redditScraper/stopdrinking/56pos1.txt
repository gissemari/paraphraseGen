I am happier and healthier. ..I've had 3 major successes. ..I went to a concert - didn't drink. .I went to a wedding - didn't drink. .Date night - didn't drink. ..All of these situations proved to me that I can have fun without booze. I didn't have any less fun I didn't miss it. I don't miss it. Not drinking has made me more active. I run 3 miles every other day. I am more present with my kid. Instead of being preoccupied with when I can start drinking or more interested in maintaining my buzz I'm playing and chatting and I'm present with him. ..This subreddit has been invaluable. Taking time to make a 24 hour pledge every day has made a huge difference. ..I keep telling myself. I am not missing anything by not drinking. But I will certainly miss out on a lot if I start again. ..As I read here earlier I just need to say no to one drink - the first drink. This is my new mantra...No drinking today SD. Much love...Edit: I also had an awful dream last night. That I was hiding my drinking from my husband again. I was downing shooter after shooter of warm vodka. I felt despair and  hopelessness. When I woke up I was still processing the dream... and I still had those intense feelings of despair. Emotional way to start a day. But a good reminder. I basically had all the intense feelings of relapse without relapsing. Makes me more disinterested in drink.

Oh man the wedding would be so hard for me good job!!! 
Well done to you. I like the idea of saying no to the one drink - the first drink. I have a family meal tonight and am fearful of having a drink but I will use your 'trick' to just say no. Thank you
