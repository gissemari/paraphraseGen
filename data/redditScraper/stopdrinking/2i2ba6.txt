Just feeling like life is going no where.  I went to rehab moved cities into a sober living place left all my friends and basically started a new life.  The thing is I have no life.  At least when I was drinking I was working (barely) on a farm and hung out with people.  I obviously needed to quit (drinking a liter plus everyday of vodka) because I was super depressed and withdrawls were terrible!  Basically self demoralization.  .But I am having self demoralization sober and it sucks.  Just thinking of the future and living my whole life out just seems daughting.  I dont have a job and just go to meetings.  I am 24 years old and am surrounded by older men 30s being young.  I am joining the californai conservation corps but am on a waitlist.  I need advice on what to do.  I felt great for a month or two but this week just sucks.  I do not want to do anything except drink and just crawl into a ditch and disapear.  I need advice!!! please I am 4 months sober and thought I was doing good.  I have seen a bunch of people in my program relapse and I never thought I would.  I am not about to buy a bottle but damn its tempting.  Life just sucks and need Advice.

First understand that you are not your job and what you are up against is bigger than yourself.  As a society [we are facing social upheaval](http://www.technologyreview.com/view/519241/report-suggests-nearly-half-of-us-jobs-are-vulnerable-to-computerization/) that hasn't been seen in generations if ever and it is as true today as it ever that when the economy the youth often bear the brunt as the older generations are entrenched in jobs and money...Just saying society is failing its workers today not the other way around...&gt;Since the current recovery began in 2009 **all economic gains have gone to the top 10 percen**t. The bottom 90 percent has lost ground...&gt;**We're in the first economic upturn on record in which 90 percent of Americans have become worse off.**..[Former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich](http://www.salon.com/2014/09/30/robert_reich_trickle_up_economics_are_killing_americas_middle_class_partner/)...Instead of internalizing negative circumstance you need to build up your true self (which is obscured by depression) -- but how?  To seek out new experiences and find inspiration there.  What is it that you enjoy?  Seek out those moments and live in them...If you want to give meditation a try I'd recommend guided to get your started.  There is a good five minute one [here](http://marc.ucla.edu/body.cfm?id=22&amp;oTopID=22).  Without getting mystical training your mind to focus and relax in a specific way can bring focus and peace into your life...Or try dating?  But if so /r/OKCupid is a must.  Create new experiences and you will find ways to savor life...And I cannot recommend exercise highly enough.  You are a young man you are at approaching optimal growth hormone production and should take advantage of these years.  It is also a great way to release stress and treat your mind and body kindly.  Seriously exercise daily.  in that vein eat nutrition.  Alcoholics are notouriously malnourished so you may want some D and B vitamin supplements to help you feel less like shit (you WILL feel like shit with bad nutrition -- eat salads and fruits)...Last there is /u/ryans01's [Four Rule Plan to a more Productive Life](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af?context=3)..* Rule 1: There are no more zero days. Every day you must take at least one action towards achieving your goals or making yourself a better person...* Rule 2: Be grateful to the  three you's : Past  you' present  you' and future  you'. Thank the past  you' for the positive things it has done. Do favors for the future you...* Rule 3: Forgive Yourself. Forgive your past self for not taking action. Move on. Make the best of today so your future self may benefit...* Rule 4: Exercise and Learn. Workout so you may feel better look better and become a better person. Read biographies educational books and non-fiction. Every problem thought experience and feeling you've had has been solved or experienced by someone else. Learn from them....Good luck!
Volunteer.  Find a soup kitchen and mop the floor.   Help an old lady across the road even if she does not want to go.  Do something...you don't mention meetings are you going?..
