31 days clean and serene and I don't ever want to go back.  That's after 1.5 years of doing my thing after relapsing with 3.5 years.  Fuck that old way of life.  Meetings are what works.  And the MJ maintenance plan is NOT recovery.  If you're new go to a meeting if you like it go to another.  If you don't go to another.  I can't do this on my own and you probably can't either.  Just my experience.
