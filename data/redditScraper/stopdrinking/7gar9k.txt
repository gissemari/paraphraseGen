Just hit 9 months last night. Feels good. Here's is a comparison of me from a year ago vs just a few weeks ago - [Link](https://imgur.com/3Vd3omH). I've lost 50 pounds total. Haven't felt this good since I was in my early 20s. ..Two things that have helped me immensely have been running and reading. Running has kept me positive and gave me something to work towards(also sped up the weight loss). Reading has taught me more about why I think the way I think. I highly recommend This Naked Mind by Annie Grace. I've never read a book quite like it and what I read really stuck with me. ..I still struggle especially this time of the year. All I need to think about is how hard I've worked to get here and what the consequences are if I choose to go back to the old me. A good quote I heard recently is "stop looking for happiness in the same place you lost it". That pretty much sums everything up...Stay strong everyone. One day at a time and I'll be right there with you.

Awesome. I'm inspired by your journey. Thank you for your advice too.

It helps to hear that others are going through similar things. This is my first sober holiday season in 10+ years and it is providing some challenges to be sure. ..I'll be at 9 months in a little less than a week and I feel like a new person. I have so much hope. ..
You look amazing!
