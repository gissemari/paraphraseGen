My dad was an alcoholic who got sober before he had me. When I was 8 my mum left me and him to go away and teach English in a foreign country. She relapsed over the course of a few years got better relapsed again all while my two brothers were going through the same  motions as meth addicts...I'm 25 now. I've had problems with alcohol since I was a teenager cocaine on and off for a few years. When I was 23 I saw it all becoming a problem after a rough night i took it upon myself to head to an AA meeting. After growing up with my dad and attending many I knew what to expect. The people were of course very kind and accepting but seemed really intense with the religious stuff. The thought of asking a random stranger to be my sponsor was also off putting. Only went once. didn't even open the book they gave me. ..I moved to a big city when I was 23 to do music. In the first year I had a solid house set up shared with some mature young adults and saw it as a good starting point for my career. During the next year I slowly fell back into my bad habits of drinking nightly doing blow if its around and smoking weed constantly. I racked up a $650 tab from the restaurant I was working at and my boss was getting worried he noticed I was having trouble paying it off so he paid for it on some other conditions. By this time I had moved into my studio. No Showers. No kitchen. Not even legally allowed to be staying here. I picked up one-off gigs from my studio landlord and tried to get a few other jobs but to no avail. I was sinking. I was starting to see how my life was becoming increasingly unmanageable and the amount of time and money I spent on alcohol and drugs was a serious burden on my physical and mental health. But not enough apparently. I needed to have an experience that kicked my ass so hard I couldn't ignore it any longer. I needed an experience to say "if you keep doing this you will die sad and alone and soon"..I had that experience last week after a night of cocaine and drinking. I woke up in the middle of the night hardcore nausea uncontrollable shakes and sweats extreme dizziness unable to stand or walk tried throwing up but it did not help it was about 30 mins of that and it ended with 10 minutes of hyperventilating and me missing work for the whole weekend. I was seconds away from calling the ambulance. I told my friend and she asked the dealer to test his stuff. Maybe it was the drug maybe my body had finally had enough. I told myself non-nonchalantly and with little enthusiasm that I needed to quit cocaine. Again. And for at least the 4th or 5th time in my life. The same friend and I went for food on Sunday. She bought me a few drinks and invited me to her friends house where there is definitely more drinks and cocaine and whatever other drugs they do on a weekly basis. Should have said no but I didn't want to go back to my studio and be depressed and alone. So I went and inevitably ended up doing more cocaine with these randies who knew nothing about me and had no interest in being real friends passed the drug use. I woke up Monday with another crippling hangover and a migraine that kept me incapacitated till this morning and even now I am sitting here with body aches shortness of breath no money no food no phone (can't pay my bills) a low paying part time job and no control over my life. ..I'm scared I'm going to feel better tomorrow and rationalize that I can have a drink again even knowing it'll make me want more coc. I'm scared that when I go to a meeting Ill be turned off by the intensity of some people or tell myself "well im not as bad as some people it cant be a real problem". I'm scared ill forget about this terrifying experience I've had and I'm scared no one will understand me or be able to help. I don't know what to do and it's freaking the shit out of me. Please help me make this my Day one and share any wisdom experience or kind words to help me help myself and motivate myself to continue to do so. I'm so done with this shit. ....

Hang in there and keep trying and I'd give the meeting a try. Worst case scenario? you never go back and can confirm you won't get anything from it no big deal. Best case scenario though? Well you find a group of people you do like and get a support group you may need...Half an hour to find out which doesn't sound like much of a loss to me. :) ..One day at a time and IWNDWYT.
Yes welcome.  I am only on day 2 so I'm in no position to be giving advice.  Day 1 is a drag ass long day.  I did my best to try and keep doing something and get through it.  I really felt like crap.  I feel better today.  Like you I got similar problems:  body aches no $ and no control over my life.  It's so fucking depressing.  I get that feeling that no one will understand me.  And that is true to an extent.  Non alcoholics sure don't get it.  I get where you are at cuz I am there too.  About everyone in this community will "get it".  Best wishes my friend.  You can do the next minute and the next 5 minutes.   You can get day one.
