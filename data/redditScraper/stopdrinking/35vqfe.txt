I've been an alcoholic for the last 8 years.  I'm 27 now probably drink a 12 pack a day.  Today is day 10 of sobriety and I feel horrible.  This is the 3rd time I've tried quitting and I always seem to relapse around day 10. The extreme fatigue and sweaty palms always seems to make me turn back to the sauce.  Any advice or information about why it always seems to be day 10 that gets me would be much appreciated.

What would it take for you to get through day 10 sober?
Stick it out - it will get better! You can do this!
I'm in a similar boat though currently on day. Believe it or not I'm also 27 and have had alcoholic tendencies since starting college. The two suggestions I have that help me are .1. Eating outside of what is normally like...i.e. Not as healthy and not as much potion control. I find that my cravings are less when I'm full or feel fulfilled based on what I ate. It's not the healthiest option but it's a hell of a lot better than drinking even one beer..2. Occupy your mind on something you enjoy. Whether it's a tv show video game book etc...anything to get your mind off the misery that withdrawal is causing. If you can't think of anything you like occupy your time figuring out what that is. You'll certainly find something
Don't panic. Give it time. Time heals.
