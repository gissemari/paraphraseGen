I hear that it's common to have  using dreams  and I'm a week away from six months sobriety. Last week I had two dreams of drinking. Both were more intense than usual. The last one I could feel the warm buzz in my chest and the calm relaxation and I felt as if my eyes were moving slower than if I was sober. It was frightening because I had guilt for relapsing (in my dream) and felt intoxicated in my dream as well...I heard that  guilt can be a good thing as it is a soul's call to action  so perhaps the dreams are thee to keep me in check maybe and to show me what could happen if I go back out...At any rate the only thing stronger than fear is hope and I will not drink with you today.

The dreams happen. Nice work on almost 6 months!
My dreams eased off after 90 days but I had them again at 180. ( i think its a PAWS thing)
Dreams are more likely to occur around milestones I think. I try to use the experiences to reinforce why I quit. Usually they are unpleasant. You get to experience the guilt of what relapse might feel like but you can rest assured you've done nothing wrong and nothing is wrong with you.
