Please hang in there.  I'm 28 and drank heavily for years.  The medical risks aren't worth it.  I have hypertension I'm on the verge of being diabetic and I have liver issues of which the doc isn't sure how serious it is yet (we'll be rechecking enzyme levels and doing and ultrasound soon).  At this point if I met genie and had 3 wishes it be $10 billion a three-way with Olivia Wilde and Scarlet Johansson and quitting drinking when I was 23.  Think of your health and your future.  I will not drink with you today. 
What are you doing to help yourself? For me distractions that got my hands busy were a huge help. Do something for a few minutes--clean a puzzle homework--then reevaluate. You can always drink in the future. It's the now that you need to get through.
