Fairly mild story. I'm a return subscriber and I had a better one last time I "got sober" which lasted a couple weeks only. My tone is one of annoyance and disappointment. I've got so much good stuff good stuff going for me. Hard worker smart charismatic and all. I feel like my drinking is a dark stain on my character. I'm sick and somehow found a way to drink for God's sake!...So the other day I woke up from having 1 bottle of wine feeling like shit. I decided I'd stop. Then on my way home from work I remembered I'd ordered wine online since there was some sort of "bonus bottle" or some such thing. ...So I picked up four bottles of wine and drank all the way through 1 of them and then another glass after the first bottle of rose. I ended up passing out and I woke up and felt stupid remembering I'd ordered Italian delivery. ...I'm overweight...struggling and going back and forth between healthy and not(usually drink related). Used to be healthy eater and 40 pounds lighter. It's like I have to be addicted to something? Most people can't see me as a drinker or former smoker or occasional drug user...I can only wish that were true. Wish I was the good girl I appear to be... .Food was on the table when I got up(roommate? who knows...)..I'm spending money without joy. My head hurts. I always have some rationalization. My mom is the only one I want to talk to about it. She had to quit due to health reasons. I was so torn up by her drinking growing up and now here I am...same thing but without the kid. ...I don't know what to do with it now.

"The apple usually doesn't fall far from the tree" is an expression that comes to mind. Children of alcoholics have their own very special set of needs sometimes. Having your mom to talk about it with sounds like that could be a huge help. Way better than being alone with nobody to talk to as so many others including me had to learn...We're here for you so nobody who want to stop drinking needs to feel alone...Action or excuses what's it going to be? For me it was years of excuses and then action when it got bad enough. How bad is bad enough? You decide...
