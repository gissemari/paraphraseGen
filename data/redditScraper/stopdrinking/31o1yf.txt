I'm saying hello to this subreddit. Although you don't know it reading here has been a help to me over the last few months. After struggling to cut down my alcohol intake I have made the decision to stop drinking. At just over a week without a drink I am feeling calmer and more well-rested and I'm sleeping better than I have in quite a while. I'm reading the Allen Carr book now and plan on attending my first SMART recovery meeting within the week. A sincer thanks to all of you.

Congrats to you lebeau! I was amazed by how much better I slept after giving up drinking.
Congrats! It's crazy how disruptive alcohol is for your sleep. I am curious to hear about how your SMART recovery meeting goes. I really want to start going but we don't have any in my area. AA will have to do for now.
