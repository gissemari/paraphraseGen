Hey all I could use some words of encouragement!..My boyfriend was supposed to come over tonight and I haven't seen him in over a week. He's unfortunately sick and can't come by and I really miss him. Nobody's at my apartment right now and I'm feeling pretty lonely and disappointed and the trigger to drink just sprang up...

That sucks I normally go out Saturday but I'm 1 week sober. So you aren't the only one lonely.
Drinking alone isn't worth it. What would feel better tomorrow? A hangover or the pride of staying sober after being tempted to drink?
Hang in there. Mild disappointment tonight will lead to massive suffering tomorrow if you drink. 
Drinking has a way of turning mild disappointment into major disappointment regret and shame.
