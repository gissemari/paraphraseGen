hello SD friends. I drifted away for a few months but damn it I am back. I lost my dear cousin in late January to a massive heart attack in his sleep. he was only 36 yrs old and like us an alcoholic. over the holidays I noticed he was looking terrible. beer gut was huge and he had a yellowish skin tone. it was just a really heavy experience for me and I spiraled out of control thru my grief with a major relapse. I am just a year older than him and he always looked up to me growing up. when I went thru my divorce a few years ago I was out of control and he was the only one to reach out and gave me a place to stay and get back on my feet. he had a beautiful soul.. his girlfriend confirmed that towards the end he was consistently drinking an easy 12 pack+ almost every night and they would go round and round about it but he was deep into depression and there was no stopping him. so I'm not here to be a downer friends. just checking in really. now that the smoke has cleared from all of this and I'm lucky to have survived this relapse with my job still intact (barely) and no irreparable damage to my friends and family (barely)....I am just so fucking done ya know? thanks for having me back. it's good to be home.
