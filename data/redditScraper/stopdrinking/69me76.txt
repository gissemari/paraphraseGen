Hi guys! .. I was sober for five years and then about four months ago I just... wasn't anymore. At first my relapse was fun but the fun was really short lived. I've been wanting to quit again for months but haven't. .. This morning my husband told me that I need to teach our five year old how to call 911 in case I drink myself to death and he's not around. And it's true. Last night I drank almost an entire bottle of 100 proof whisky. (I'm 110 pounds for gods sake!) .. Anyway I'm done. I feel like trash and my family deserves better than what I've been giving them. Thank you all for being here and I'm happy to be apart of the community!

Welcome!  I had over 6 years and relapsed about 3 years ago.  Most I've put together in the 3 years is 9 months...It gets harder for me!  Each time the withdrawals are worse this last time I wasn't even drinking much but damn . . . . ...I know the drill I just can't start!  Never sure where it's going to go when I do.
