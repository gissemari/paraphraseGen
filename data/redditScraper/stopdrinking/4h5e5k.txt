I've not posted in awhile. That's been for a reason. I moved to Europe from the US about two months ago. I stopped going to meetings (although they are here) and with no one looking over my shoulder or holding me accountable... ..Not even sure why I drank again. Nothing triggered it as far as I know. Lots of self reflection to do there. So why am I back? I DO want to stop drinking. I've been postponing going to meetings but I recently reconnected with an old friend and they're struggling with alcohol and depression too. He's too far away for me to take him to a meeting myself (and I don't know if he's ready for that yet anyway) but I did introduce him to this community. ..So for today I won't drink. I'll find a meeting and ask for a sponsor. And I will be there best as I can for my friend.

I'm sure the stress of moving has been hard but can creep up if you don't acknowledge it. A few years ago I moved across the US and I certainly responded by drinking more. 
We all fall down.  Getting back up takes a lot of strength.  I was sober two years once and a stupid fight with my ex triggered me back into the cycle.  Good thing is you recognize that you want to quit and it sounds like you know what to do.  Be safe.
Welcome back!
