I'm 23 years old and just got half a year sober. I was sober for 3 and a half months before using 9 more and getting the courage to go back to meetings. Sober life has been amazing and I have made some awesome friends who push me to grow in a positive connection. I have been struggling however with feeling lonely and missing the party atmosphere. ..There's this girl I used to work with around 4 years ago who I always had a crush on but was always too afraid to talk to. I'm a restaurant manager and she comes in and bar tends for us now 2 nights a week. It definitely felt like she was flirting with me and I got caught up with the thought of how am I supposed to date as a sober 23 year old. I spend a lot of time at work (50 hours a week) and work irregular hours. I know I can't go out with anyone for drinks after work but it's just creating a bit of a lonely feeling inside. ..I know if I keep improving myself one day I'll find a girl outside of the party lifestyle. Thanks for letting me rant

Even if she still drinks maybe she thinks you are hot because she has noticed you don't.  Ask her out on day date.  Something active where drinking isn't the norm.  You guys work in a restaurant / bar.  Maybe last thing she wants is dinner ans drinks as a date.
