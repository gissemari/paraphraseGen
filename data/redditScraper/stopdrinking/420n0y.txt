I feel so stupid. I'm going to ruin everything. I'm having to do rehab in order for me to keep my job and I just don't know if I can do this.

I'm sorry bud. I've gone through relapse. It's tough. But you're here posting....that shows you're trying. ..Stay strong and be kind to yourself. Remember that failure and relapse are only a bruise not a tattoo. 
It is OK. Maybe you can make a commitment to not drink today?
When did you stop going to your AA meetings?
