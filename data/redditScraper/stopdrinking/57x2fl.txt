So I have decided that I would like to become active in my fairly small community. Years ago a donated a picture of my section taken in Afghanistan and they hung it front and center with the rest of the veteran military pictures which made me very proud. ..This is a paid membership club and everything such as food a drinks go by donation only as far as I understand. I like their message in the pamphlet that I read and I would like to become a member. This place also happens to be adjacent to my AA meeting hall. Yesterday I stopped in to look at my picture and ran into a endearing WW2 veteran and club leader who was gracious enough and hand on my shoulder told me that "We need you. We need replacements."..The problem is that this club is half bar half meeting hall. I have 60 days today and I am supposed to meet the club leader today to show him my discharge paperwork and become a member. I like many who have relapsed believe that I can handle the scene. I feel comfortable there and believe that I could be happy there and take part in the activities without ever taking a drink...This is important to me and it will help me stay active in the community outside of just AA which I haven't really been active in too long either...I would like some honest opinions. Thank you.

I'm going to speak from the 'I' even though my situation is quite different from yours. I started a new job last spring after being out of the workforce for many years. I was also only a few months sober. However early on I made it known that I don't drink. Occasional office lunches and celebrations always include alcohol but I am known as the non-drinker so no booze is offered to me. I join in the camaraderie but not the drinking. Now my office is NOT a bar but having people there know me as a non-drinker removes any option to drink when an occasion arises. Would this be something you'd be comfortable doing? I can't imagine you're the only sober member...unless this is really a drinking club more than a veteran's club. If that's the case I'd think about finding another group. I hope for your sake that it's not and you'll find them welcoming of a sober member.
My situation is different but maybe it can help in some way. I am looking for a new job and have decided that once I am hired somewhere I'll let them know that I don't drink. ..Not like "hi nice to meet you I don't drink." But once that first invite to a bar or an offer to buy me a drink or whatever I'll just say right then that I don't drink...I hope I'm making sense. Also I come from a military family and I'm betting that there are some people in the club that don't drink. I hope you can do this club if you really want to! From my family's perspective veterans supporting each other can be a wonderful thing.
