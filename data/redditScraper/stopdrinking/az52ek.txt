*From both weed and alcohol..My drug problems were spiraling into a never ending pit of abyss. As you can see from my post history I full boar gave up on life 2 weeks ago and tried relapsing on heroin (artificial short-lived happiness) but was luckily scammed and he sold me chocolate. I'm completely broke but will go to the ends of the earth for a buzz. ..Nevertheless this is the first time I've been completely sober for 3 days in a row for a year maybe 2 years. I'm trying to be that "almost 30 y/o guy that gets sober and turns his life around." I've been absolutely bawling not just because of chemical imbalances normalizing but also retrospectively thinking about opportunities lost girls I could have dated but was too much of a coward how I could own a home today if I hadn't been such a fuck-up for so many years in a row. ..I feel good though already seems like my skin is healthier taking solid shits and don't have to wake up nursing a hangover every day. Looking forward to a future of health. I've done 3 triathlons and 2 marathons long ago maybe I'll be that person again.

It's crazy how quickly skin can look better.
