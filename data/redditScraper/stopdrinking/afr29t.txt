The struggle between drinking and not drinking seems so easy for others without a  problem .  Just stop you don't need it Yada yada!  .What is funny is when I can make it 24 hours without drinking I feel great. I actually form a SMALL desire not to drink again. Yet this is such a fragile desire it takes very little for me to start again. .When I break and have that  one last drink!  (Binge) it takes all my will and courage to fight the desire to stop again and I usually simply give in to the alcoholism's. .There is always a voice in the back of my head telling me no more stop drinking you feel and work so much better when you fall to sleep sober. Yet this voice is nearly always drowned out by what I figure is my vice with a mega phone screaming into my other ear!  DRINK! DRINK DRINK!!!  .

This sounds like a classic description of cognitive dissonance a technical term for the conflict I had between my conscious and subconscious mind that was nurtured by many years of conditioning...Annie Grace explains this extremely well in This Naked Mind. I would recommend reading it and absorbing every chapter. The knowledge imparted by this book and the wisdom of SD helped me regain my direction my health and my freedom..
My coworker complained that in college his friend would want to keep partying do shots eventually black out when he just wanted to get fast food and go to bed...I never used to believe in alcoholism but his friend describes me well. We're wired a certain way. The only lucid judgment we have is when sober.
I've been at the fight for over a year and the fragile desire gains strength and the voice gets weaker. Don't give up. Eventually it does just become a simple choice but I still occasionally make the wrong one. But no longer because a megaphone is screaming.
