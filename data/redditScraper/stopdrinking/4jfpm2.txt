Finally after creating and account and relapsing then creating this account and relapsing again I figured I'd stick with this account to hold myself accountable.  After two relapses since quitting I finally made it a week!  Haven't gone a week without drinking in a longgggg time.  Honestly it's been a fantastic week.  Here's a little recap...First two days I felt utterly horrible literally thought I might have to go to the hospital for the hangover from the relapse.  I stuck it out without drinking though and woke up on Tuesday morning this past week feeling better.  The rest of this week I woke up on time well rested every morning.  Made myself breakfast before work and shaved every morning something I never did everyday back when I was always crawling out of bed hungover.  I finally got signed up for classes this summer (something I've been too hungover to "deal with" every day for the past 4 months) got my car inspected which I've been telling myself I'd do for ages mowed my grass went running 3 days in a row and managed to have legitimate phone conversations with my girlfriend every night which I was always too drunk to do so I usually just texted.  That was only Tuesday through Friday!..The weekend has been even better probably because I am used to getting smashed and sleeping all weekend and that's it.  This weekend was different.  Friday night I played video games and ate junk food not glamorous but relaxing.  Saturday morning I woke up at sunrise and went to the most popular donut shop in town got there before they opened and got a dozen fresh donuts and took them to my parents house to hang out with them for a few hours.  Then I met up with my girlfriend played putt putt did batting cages and went for a drive.  Ended the evening watching mad men and eating buffalo wings.  It's Sunday now and I am up early again I have a tee time to make this morning and will go for a run and make breakfast before I leave for the course...Had my first drinking dream last night and the guilt that came with it was horrible.  Woke up in the middle of the night feeling so ashamed.  So relieved when I found out I was just dreaming...I am 25 and this is one of the most memorable weekends I have had since I started drinking every weekend in college.  Sorry for narrating my entire week but I did that in hopes that when drinking again enters my mind I can read this and remember how great being sober has been for me.  Thanks for all your support SD it's meant alot!

Congratulations on your week!
Hey congratulations on your week!  I made a point of saving posts from SD that were particularly relevant to me so that when I needed a reminder they'd be there for me.  Keep doing that it helps...Stick with it it only gets better!
