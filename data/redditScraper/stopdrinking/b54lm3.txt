I reset my badge again today after a night of drinking last night.  I am struggling finding a replacement for my night out drinking every 1-3 weeks.  I have consistently gone 2-3 weeks without drinking multiple times in the last year.  I actually can't even remember the last time I was out of control drunk.  Despite this I don't want to drink anymore.  The hangovers are becoming brutal.  One night of drinking is enough to ruin my sleep for what feels like an entire week every single time I drink.  ..The issue is that I am finding myself unable to enjoy social situations where others are drinking without drinking myself.  The way I am successfully not drinking is isolating myself from my friends.  Every single one of my close friends drinks regularly.  Many of these friends don't have shared hobbies outside of drinking.  Without this connection we would likely rarely hang out.  I need to some how get over this to get over my hump.  I need advice from other posters on how I can successfully manage this part of sobriety.  Day 1 started again today.  I am going to make a commitment to myself this time to at least post here every friday and saturday as a start to making further changes.

I feel you. I am 25 and my hangovers are not as light as they used to be. My sleep gets totally wrecked for 3 or 4 days just by drinking a six pack a given day. I've just realized I also don't have any shared hobbies with my friends besides drinking. This past weekend was the first in a long time I did not hang out with them and I did so by making up whatever excuse that came to my mind because I am still not sure how to tell them about my decision. ..I don't even feel like drinking most of the time the thing is whenever I gather with my friends the first thing we do is head to the liquor store to get some beer. And then more. And in the weekends we get something else. And guess who's the one who always gets wasted and does stupid shit and forgets everything that happened? Yeah...I guess we have to overcome the fear of being isolated if we really wanna do this. And maybe accept the fact that things are not going to be the same. New people new hobbies maybe. I don't know I am really struggling with it as well. Hopefully someone who has been on our skin gives us some piece of advice...The only thing I am sure of is that I don't want to do stupid shit unconsciously anymore I don't want to wake up feeling like crap anymore and I don't want to be unhealthy because of an unnecessary habit I acquired because I didn't know better. ..Anyway best of luck. Feel free to share your thoughts. ..
