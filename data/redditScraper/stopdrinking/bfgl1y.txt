Hello all! This is my first post here and I'm happy to report that as of today I am 7 days sober! I had a question about quitting/withdrawals did any of you experience slight abdominal pains after quitting?.   . A month ago I quit for a week but relapsed and drank rather heavily for 3 weeks but once again I am tired of feeling sick and tired so I'm commenting to stopping altogether..   .I was just curious to whether this is my a reaction to detox or something more serious. Anyways thank you all for this wonderful community it really does help.

Nobody here can give you a valid and safe medical opinion I'm afraid; my abdominal twinges (which I did experience) could be very different in character and cause to the pain that you're experiencing so it wouldn't be safe to equate the two. If you're worried about any symptoms you're experiencing I'd recommend ringing up your GP to have a chat or make an appointment with them as they're best-placed to help you.
I would see a doctor  if you feel any problems in your abdomen.  The problem may have been there before you quit and you didn't  notice.
During withdrawal I experienced pain everywhere basically. It would often come as shooting pains and strange/unnatural sensations like tingling and/or burning. It ranged from mildly uncomfortable to extremely painful. You should find a way to see a doctor if you're worried about it as heavy drinking can of course have many different types of consequences that may need to be addressed medically.
