I've posted a couple of times today so apologies if I'm repeating..I'm just here for the support of you all..Badge reset today. I'm currently sweating shaking hands and wrists and drowning in my own self loathing. ..I hate this disease. I hate the monster in me that can be so destructive. ..I'm back here with you good people after 2 months sober. That's the longest I've managed. .I didn't relapse because I desperately wanted to drink. I relapsed because I underestimated what would happen if I had  just one'. .Now nearly a week and several bottles of gin cider and wine later I'm reduced to this sweating shaking creature. .Not to mention some pretty disgusting behaviour over the last week. ..One day at a time. That's all we can do. ..IWNDWYT.

My limit is none as well. Welcome back.
Aw mate sorry you're suffering!..That'll be the [Kindling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindling_(sedative%E2%80%93hypnotic_withdrawal) effect in action... the withdrawals get worse every time you go through it.....The good news is you never have to feel this way ever again!..If in another 2 months down the line the thought of 'Just One' starts sounding like a good idea come and read your own words back to yourself and remind yourself what happens and where it leads to.....Hope you feel better soon and if it gets bad see a doctor! ..A spot of Librium or something to take the edge off is a mercy.....IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Take care of yourself and listen to your body.  If it gets worse seek medical attention.  You're the third one tonight I am worried about.  Hang in there and let us know how you're doing. 
Well done on being sober. I am sober today after 40 years of drinking hell. You are a great inspiration to me. Let's keep sober together today and I really appreciate your help today with your company on SD
Just remember how it feels! Don't forget it. Next time you won't fall for the Moderation Trap! One thing that prevents me from convincing myself that "just one" will be OK is asking myself: what's the point? I drank to get *drunk.* Moderation is torture. Zero drinks is so much easier.
I'm right there with you..It will get better.  IWNDWYT!
It's a process for most people.  Some lucky ones get it the first time.  I just reset my badge too.  Are you using any other tools?  Reading books?  Watching podcasts? Therapist? AA? I've been using Smart Recovery online.  It is based on cognitive behavior therapy.    IWNDWYT
