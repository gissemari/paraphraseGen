This is my second Christmas sober since I became sober October 2017.   I have a lot of trauma history and used alcohol as a way to self medicate.  I have gotten therapy and worked on some of my issues but the holidays really brought them to the surface and I realize that I have further to go with my healing.  I saw my family yesterday and made it through the gathering ok but I am kind of an emotional wreck right now.  Last Christmas I was white knuckling through the holidays and was just focused on not drinking.  This Christmas I am more aware of my emotions and am identifying what I need to work on.  I am going to focus on getting through tomorrow and then make a plan for what I need to do to process through some of these issues.  Can anyone else relate to this?  Sometimes I feel that I am alone in my struggles.

Your title says it all  it's so hard but I'm going to make it. ..I'm really struggling today. And there isn't anyone in my family that I really want to share my darkest alcoholic feelings with. Today was really really hard but I'm going to make it. You're not alone in this...IWNDWYT my friend
I am literally sitting here with the glow of The Christmas tree and I am crying reading this. I'm 9 months sober and haven't revealed to anyone on my side of the family that I am an alcoholic. I want a drink so bad right now. My wife is asleep as are my children. I'm so lonely and trying to fight off self pity and character defects. I feel you tonight is so damn hard but I am not going to drink. We can do this together. 
I can relate. You are not alone! The longer I go the more I am able to work through the issues by seeing them clearly and making good choices about how to resolve them.
