Morning routine has improved sleep is much better and the fog is lifting...I make no presumptions I have been here beforeI know I must be vigilant and have a plan but for today I have hope.I have read a number of posts recently from younger members scared about their health and even self diagnosing Cirrhosis in some casesI post this today for them..I am 58 years old averaged a pint of vodka every day for 35 years(with a few breaks of 5 months and 3 months in the last 2 years ) and being a child of the 70's throw in whatever illicit drug you can name at one time.I am not ready to throw in the towel and I am ready for this day but it is a daily struggle.The human body takes a beating but I can say today I am happy it has given me yet another chance.Blood work and tests in a couple weeksI will report back...Thanks for reading IWNDWYT
