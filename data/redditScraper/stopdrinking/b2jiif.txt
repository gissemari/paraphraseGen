Maybe it's my affinity for the Harry Potter series but I saw this article elsewhere on Reddit today (it's older) but it helped lift my spirits some...We're not alone in this. IWNDWYT!..https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/16/daniel-radcliffe-alcohol-harry-potter

A subscriber at /r/TIL I see.
I like what he said about alcohol turning him into a rude bore
Ben Affleck's story is also a good one. He's an advocate of sobriety now. 
Dax Shepard as well
So many famous ones are...James Hetfield Sam Jackson Anthony Hopkins Jeff Tweedy....Also some who have left us - Leonard Nimoy Roger Ebert and the great great Chris Cornell :(

Disheartening to see so many Reddit comments on the original /r/todayilearned post dismissing it as normal or "just a typical teenager in the UK!"..(Even if that latter part is true) it's amazing to me how much of a defense mechanism large portions of society have against deeming alcohol to be a problem in their lives or lives of others. That or they just have a latent emotional connection to his character in HP films and don't want to "tarnish" their mental image of him.
Bradley copper Anthony Hopkins that really good looking guy married to Sofia Vergara etc etc
Mary J. Bulge Drew Barrymore Jamie Lee Curtis...
Thanks for the link. It's always nice to hear others perspective. 
&gt; I was living in constant fear of who I'd meet what I might have said to them what I might have done with them so I'd stay in my apartment for days and drink alone..I can relate to this guy. 
Me talking to my friend Cliff:  Man that Daniel Radcliffe is rad Cliff. 
Thank you for sharing I actually never knew this! And from the listed celebrities I now know of a few more inspirational people that have struggled with alcoholism. ..Like Leonard Nimoy for one that resonates with my geeky heart on a whole other level.   
Nobody has mentioned will Arnett yet
The more celebs the better that come out!
