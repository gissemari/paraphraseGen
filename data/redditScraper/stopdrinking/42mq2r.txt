I could not be more grateful for this accomplishment. It's been a tough road. A few relapses after I initially decided to quit drinking in May 2014. My body could not take it anymore. It seemed like forever for the withdrawal symptoms to go away. Then after I had been sober for about 6 months I developed severe anxiety to the point where I couldn't drive or even enter a store by myself. I tried dealing with it on my own but then finally broke down and went to the doctor. I am now on a much better path with my anxiety and I know how to manage it. I still have good days and bad days. But what I've noticed most lately is not the big cravings (which I still get occasionally) is missing the buzz. A craving can hit you like a ton of bricks but missing the buzz is like a dull roar that continues throughout the day. However I realized how I strong I am in the past 18 months and have learned how to distract myself when those problems arise. I am the happiest I've been in a long time! I know how hard this is but the reward is worth the pain.
