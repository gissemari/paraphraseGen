Dealing with assholes at work where I cant tell them to fuck off makes me want to drink. Or at least smoke. I guess i'm just too sensitive but fuck.....this shit is how I always relapse.

Humans aren't perfect nor do they have to behave in a way that my ego deems acceptable. It's hard to accept at times particularly at work but I find taking a few moments to make sure I respond rather than react really makes a difference.
I've been free of depression since giving up drinking. I will not drink today no matter what and no asshole can influence me otherwise. I don't give assholes that sort of power.

Somewhere along the road -- about a year after I quit -- it dawned on me that most "assholes" are people that are either having a worse day than I am or are suffering in general. That's helped me when dealing with them. ..But some people just plain suck. No doubt about it. ...
Acceptance is the answer!  I used to think that I could change other people's behavior by treating them poorly but sadly that is not the case.  Now I try to remember that getting agitated over someone else's behavior only hurts me.  
Love me some W Gibson.
That sucks just plain sucks. I don't understand people sometimes but when they act like this it's usually generated by a fear that they will be on the receiving end.  Have pity on them and stay strong.  113 days!! You are great and are doing a great thing here!
They're *supposed to* act like that because they're assholes.  So they're acting just how they should really.
