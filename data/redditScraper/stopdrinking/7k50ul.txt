Hello so quick description of my current situation. Relapsed about a month ago have been binge drinking 2-3 four lokos every night uo until 2 days ago. Struggled with an addiction to playing an online game as well (ended up drinking 3 lokos the other night and got fed up smashed my laptop with a sledgehammer) anyway im detoxing at home cravings are strong tried working out today couldnt make it 15 minutes. Put on 4lbs from 158 to 162. Tried to practice drunkorexia but usually binged on food (i have an eating disorder currently in between restricting food and binging during the binge drinking) now seeing the pudge and bloated belly im afraid to eat alot again. Want to get back up to 190 again but i want to restrict due to the loose skin and bloated stomach now. I need some support hopefully able to make it to a meeting tomorrow but im terrified to leave the house due to my body image even hidden in a sweatshirt. Not sure what direction to go longest clean time i had was 1 year not new to recovery but definitely need some kind of direction and help. Much love

Hi there - so sorry to hear you're going through a tough time right now  my advice to you is to reach out to a friend family member or therapist for support. You may also need medical help as you go through detox as well. Through the process always remember to try your hardest to Be kind to yourself and take this all one day at a time. This community is a great start for support on your path to sobriety. I believe in you! IWNDWYT
