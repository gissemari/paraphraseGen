Hi! See I'm not too far ahead of you age wise (23) but I am in your shoes. I'm assuming based on you talking about drinking with 21 year old friends that you're in the US? See I'm not sure what the drinking culture is like in the US or wherever you are but in the UK where I am its ridiculous. People act like you just punched their mum in the face if you say you don't drink especially when you're young. ..Listen you're very grown up for taking action on this at the age you are not many people at your age would have the balls to admit a problem of this scale when they see it. Good on you be proud of yourself for attempting to kick this now! 
I was a young alcoholic who tried AA and sobriety before giving into peer pressure FOMO people pleasing awkwardness etc. Things did not get better and I now look back on what could have been a much different life than the shit show I am now mired in...One thing I have learned is that it is OK to cut toxic people out of my life. That doesn't mean that all those people are intentionally toxic just that they push me in the wrong direction. It is OK to do what I need to do to get better. It is OK to make new healthier connections and shed old unhealthy ones.
