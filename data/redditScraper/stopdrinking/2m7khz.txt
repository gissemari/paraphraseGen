Ignore my badge I went through a huge bender. Today is day six.  It's the longest I've been sober since I turned 21 so for four years. Maybe longer. ..Anyway I'm realizing how much my life revolved around drinking. I wouldn't make plans on weekends or ever really because I knew I'd be either wasted or hung over. I was literally planning my entire life around it and now that I'm (struggling to keep) sober I'm realizing truly how much alcohol was my life.

Oh my badge is fixed now :)
Welcome back! What's the plan?
Don't you feel free?  Now you can plan your life around activity / events / hobbies that you always wanted...Congrats on 6 days
Yeah I stopped making plans because I knew I was just going to break them and feel bad so instead of not drinking and keeping my plans I chose not making plans so I could keep drinking. ..Welcome back
