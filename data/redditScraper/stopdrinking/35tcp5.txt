My husband is someone who genuinely enjoys a beer - just one or two - every week or so. He's not bothered whether he does or doesn't drink. We were both very wild when we got together and drinking was a big par of our relationship but now we're older and have kids he's simply cut it down without any angst or problems...He thinks I'm totally overreacting by stopping completely. And in the past he's convinced me leading to relapsing. He doesn't think my drinking was "bad enough" to quit entirely. (His mother drank herself to death with bottles of whiskey a day)..But I much prefer being sober to having "just one beer". One beer is the most pointless thing in the world and always starts me down a road to drinking more and more regularly. I like myself and my life so much better when I'm not drinking. But he thinks I'm being uptight and tells me I just need to relax...I've said all these things to him before but he doesn't stop suggesting a beer. What else can I do?
