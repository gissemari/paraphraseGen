\*I'm not going to disclose the name of the program I'm attending because the guidelines make it clear this isn't the place to promote a specific program or treatment facility.  I'm more so speaking about online-only recovery programs in general and how they could be a good option for some.\*..I am currently on day 61 of sobriety and a lot of that is thanks to the online recovery program that I joined.  I just wanted to share with everyone how things were going in my recovery and make people aware that there are other options when seeking treatment besides physically attending meetings.   .. Sixty-one days the longest duration of sobriety I've had since I was in high school (I'm 30 now).  I've been in an intensive outpatient program (IOP) for 60 of those days.  I've been attending online meetings ten hours per week; three 3-hour group meetings per week and one individual session 1-on-1 with a counselor for 1 hour per week. This was the most intensive program they offered and I chose it because I was in a pretty bad spot 62 days ago.  The convenience of being able to participate in the program regardless of where you are in the world is priceless for me.  Its great for business people who travel frequently for people who live in rural areas and don't have nearby AA meetings they can attend or if you have limited transportation means for whatever reason... anyone can be part of the program with an internet connection.  You can attend the meetings on a PC tablet or your smart phone. I've done all three and have never had any issues with my particular recovery program's technology... that could be different elsewhere obviously. ..The meetings are roughly 50% discussion with other people in the group and 50% educational info.  The people I've met all have their own stories that I can relate to in one way or another and everyone that I've interacted with seems to be there for the right reasons. There are a couple guys I've met in group that I'd love to hang out with because we get along so well and really push each other to get better and find solutions to our problems. Unfortunately they both live in other time zones. Maybe the only downfall I can think of regarding online programs. ..If you're nervous about attending a brick-and-mortar physical location for a meeting or treatment program and you're in a rough spot in life or really struggling with alcohol like I was keep in mind that online programs are available.  Personally if wish I would have known about this option a long time ago... I might have been able to save myself from a couple years of hangovers pancreatitis and damage to relationships.  Which is why I decided to post this today; hopefully it can help someone here. ..The biggest thing that my program has helped me with is understanding that I'm working toward **recovery and not just abstinence**. After a decade plus of abusing alcohol there's more to it than just "I'm not gonna drink anymore."  I've learned I need to be open and honest with everyone around me.  I need to be willing to change and put in effort on a daily basis to better myself.  Talking with others and sharing my story has been hugely beneficial for me; as has listening to others.  I now have a game plan moving forward on how to maintain sobriety/recovery and continue to grow as a person. I've made huge positive changes in my life over the past couple months... I'd like to give myself a lot of credit for that because this time around I really have my heart set on making changes and becoming a better husband/father/person but I wouldn't be where I'm at today without my treatment program...Again hopefully this was helpful to some of you.  Have a great day everybody.  I will not drink with you today (or ever).

There is physical and emotional sobriety. To find true happiness we must be able to attain a level of emotional sobriety. Staying dry will last for awhile and I have known people who have said that they were dry for 10 years and their lives just sucked and several became suicidal and thankfully did not go through with it. It's all about cleaning up the past when possible and learning to live in the moment and not to worry about the future.
