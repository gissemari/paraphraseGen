Good morning / afternoon / evening..**"To have faith is to trust yourself to the water. When you swim you don't grab hold of the water because if you do you will sink and drown. Instead you relax and float."   [Alan Watts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Watts)**..What I get from it: I use to think "faith" was the property of religion. LIke religions had some sort of stranglehold on the thing. I didn't think I needed any faith in the past at all so religion could have all of mine as far as I was concerned. When I got sober [it was suggested that I try to acquire some "faith"](http://geniusquotes.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Faith-quote.jpg). I was told it might help. I have had my struggles with the topic. I can still bristle some days whenever I hear a certain three letter word relating to faith. It's been nearly two years and the above quote best describes how I feel about it today. No matter how hard I try I can't grab it or hold it... Hell! [I can't even find it most days](https://quotefancy.com/quote/28154/Eckhart-Tolle-Awareness-is-the-greatest-agent-for-change) but I know the difference in the days that I do. [Those days are the really good days](http://youtu.be/pfw2Qf1VfJo). ..Thank you!.Happy Thursday!
