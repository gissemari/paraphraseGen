Where there's no way to get booze at two am. I've struggled so hard today not to drink and it's terrifying to feel so scared and distrustful of myself. I don't want to drink! I really don't. I do believe that while things might really suck right now they will get better. And I really don't want to have to go through those awful first days again. Yet it's like there's part of me that wants to sabotage myself and that part of me is so strong. It scares me so much. Ughhhhh. ..Oh well. I'm still happy that I'm awake (again!) all night driving myself crazy instead of passed out drunk. And very happy not to have drank today no matter how many seemingly perfectly sane and logical excuses I came up with. ..Have a good night all. Sorry for ranting <3

I feel you on every word you wrote here. Good job for getting through today (and the last 8 days!). I trust this is going to get better for the both of us. :)
Day 7 was a fucking trial for me. My wife was going to be out of town that night it was a Friday and the PERFECT setting for me to drink all I wanted without having her complain about it. ..I didn't drink despite all of the rationalizing my brain was doing to get me there.  ..I think each of these trials makes us a little stronger but that doesn't lessen the danger. Stay strong Alice. I'm proud of you. 
I am a master at self-sabotage. I finally decided I wanted better for my life AND I accepted that the only way to stop the cycle is to never drink ever. No exceptions. The first days are definitely the hardest. However for the first time yesterday I started to really get the feeling that sobriety was the right choice and that I really did want to stay sober. It was fleeting but it was there. I am assuming that the longer I stay sober the more the choice to live sober will begin to feel normal. 
Learning to get through our urges is a major step. Every time I got through one the next was usually a little easier to manage. I really like [DEADS as a way to remember coping strategies](http://blog.smartrecovery.org/2012/04/10/5-ways-to-deal-with-urges-and-cravings/#.VbTNElUVhBc) and [here's an extensive workbook](http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/MATCHSeries3/core.htm#2) with lots of information and exercises. It will either help you pass time late at night or put you right to sleep.
I'm proud of you Alice. I don't have anything to offer except that I am rooting for you. &lt;3
Good job Alice!!
