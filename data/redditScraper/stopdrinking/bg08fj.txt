The first 6-8 weeks I handled pretty easily the desire to drink wasn't really there. But the last 2-3 weeks my longing for alcohol has increased a bit. I won't drink; this is the longest I've ever gone I don't want to break my streak. And I'm finally forming good healthy habits....It's just been a bit harder to stick to lately. Will this pass?

Yes it will pass. You have to watch the rationalizations that creep in though .The idea that somehow we can be moderate drinkers like some other people. If you read the posts here  you see it happening again and again. One drink turns into a month long bender. Good habits make all the difference.  congratulations on your success
If you could step back why do you think it's been more difficult? We're you doing proactive things those fittest few weeks that you might have forgotten about now?..  ...Best wishes you're doing great and this will pass if you don't give in!
Thanks for sharing. It helps me be on the lookout for things that might happen. Keep on keepin' on!
Can confirm that after those initial weeks you start forgetting the reasons you quit. I can tell you right now that once you cave into having that first drink it'll all come down like a house of cards. You'll have another one maybe not the same night maybe not the same week but it'll come and you may find yourself back to square one. Stay strong! It's not worth it. IWNDWYT
