Had to put my stud goat down yesterday. Very distressing but I managed to avoid a relapse. I'm still not sleeping well only getting snatches of hours a couple times a night. ..Today is the 7th day since I've quit drinking. I still have bouts of anxiety and deep sadness/depression and difficulty controlling my emotions. I think I've probably always had these issues but have been able to suppress/not care about them while I was drinking...I also seem to be having trouble remembering things clearly even a day or two after they happen. My brain still feels foggy probably not helped by lack of sleep...&amp;#x200B;..Thank you all for your continued support. I will not drink with you today.

Congrats on reaching day 7!..Sorry to hear about your goat......The other symptoms you describe are pretty standard for about this point it definitely gets better if you stick at it! The worst will soon be over.....Keep up the good work and keep us posted!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Congratulations on persevering through tough times.  The insomnia was the worst part of it for me in those early weeks but it gets better.  ..Now you've made it through every day we have a name for its just another Sat- Sun- Mon- (etc) day from here on out! 
So sorry to hear about Mr. Tummnus but very glad you're still with us mate. IWNDWYT
