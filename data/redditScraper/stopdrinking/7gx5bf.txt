I'm back on Day 8 after a short relapse over a vacation. I kept it confined to vacation &amp; I'm feeling pretty good starting my 2nd week. I'm getting stuff done each day. Waking up in the morning is TOUGH....but once I'm up it's ok. ..With 2 young kids (&amp; 1 of them having a late December bday).....there's just so much to do this month. I NEED to keep reminding myself that there's no room for hangover days. No day that I can say to my preschooler "we are having a rest day"...I want to get things done AND actually enjoy this season w/ my kids while they are still at that magical stage. ..I was always someone even while drinking that got what I needed to done for say a holiday. But I'd be dragging myself around like a corpse at the very last minute &amp; I wouldn't enjoy a second of it. Then I'd swear to myself it'd be different next time. ..Well this is it....if I can get thru this month 1 day at a time maybe I can look back and say "this one really WAS different!" ..IWDWYT
