I've gotten a lot organized and situated with my bills medical shit and general life. I feel prepared for school to start and I am way less nervous about life. It's very nice to not worry about drinking and the money I won't have if I do so. ..I was planning on taking a long break from drinking but I also think that on a long term scale would help me more. Maybe a year? I'm not sure. But for now shooting for not drinking one day at a time is doing me quite well. ..I've lost 3 lbs since I consistently haven't been drinking and I have been doing all of my lifting and workouts at peak performance (for me). My diet has been easier to manage and I am sleeping very well. ..It took me a long time to come to terms with not drinking and sticking to it. It wasn't an easy goal to look forward to but I have been cutting back time I extend to certain people in my life and it has benefited me immensely.  Honestly it is true  you figure out who your friends are  when you quit drinking and taking offers centered around the bar or a party. ..Here's to everyone else struggling...it's hard but so worth it. Definitely won't be drinking today! .
