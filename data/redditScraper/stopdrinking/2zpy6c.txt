They say alcoholism is a progressive disease (you know *they*). I agree that you don't just take one drink and **BAM!** you're an alcoholic. And *we* all know recovery takes (a life)time. I was just thinking about all the relapse posts the success stories the different view points the different stages resets time lost lessons learned. Put it all together the good and bad the failures succeses opinions lessons etc really it boils down to the nitty gritty of the complete process which I am here on out going to refer to as my *progressive recovery*.  It sounds so damn positve! It makes me feel like I'm really going somewhere instead of the vague idea of this big open ended world of sobriety which I tell ya can still feel pretty intimidating at times. ..Here's to us fellow sobernauts!  I'm glad to be on this journey with you!
