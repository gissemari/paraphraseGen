Hi All lately I have been having relapse dreams. I keep dreaming that I pick up alcohol and then I wake up horrified. ..Thankfully I have no desire to drink in real life but I feel like my brain is reaching for a coping mechanism I used to employ. I guess I need some other tools right now. I keep dreaming that I've done horrible things drunk that I haven't done. It's a literal nightmare.

Ugh. I hate those.  I don't get them that often and sometimes the bottle of booze in my hand magically changes into some alien looking bottle of weird liquid that I don't drink.  But sometimes I "forget" in my dreams drink a six pack and suddenly remember and feel terrible.  At least waking up is a relief after the realization sets in.  ..I have been done with college for years and I still get an occasional dream that I have a final exam in a class that I didn't even know I was registered for.  I think drinking dreams will be about the same.  I imagine they will surface from time to time but I hope they become less frequent.
