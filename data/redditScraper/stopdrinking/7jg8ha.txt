First of all congratulations to everyone whether it be the first hour or your yearly anniversary!  I noticed something Saturday that made me sit in the parking lot of Walmart and cry.  Probably not an unusual sight at that place!  I noticed while I was shopping the employees were all smiling at me and saying hello.  Other customers actually seemed to make eye contact with me.  I thought it was so weird.  I got back out to my car and looked in the mirror.  I made eye contact with myself and I could see it.  The life and happiness that was once in my eyes was now back!  I looked happy again.  I didn't have hungover tired and depressed eyes.  I struggled a bit for the first few days.  Mainly because I was feeling better and thought "Ooh drink time!"  I stayed strong and kept going.  A huge thank you to this subreddit.    Reading the stories of everyone has really helped me carry on and I appreciate all of you.  Thanks for reading :) Edit: And I will not drink with any of you today :)

Nice work!
Well done! I will not drink with you today.
wow you must be doing something right if a wal mart employee smiled at you.
This is great!!  I ran a few errands on Sunday and for a few moments I actually felt like everyone else. It was a nice feeling for once.
