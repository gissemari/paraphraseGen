Hi- I've tried this before with a different user name and I relapsed. I ended a toxic relationship about a year ago and was doing well for a while. I recently met someone new and I do not want my drinking to affect my new relationship with this wonderful man. I was very honest with him when we first met and told him of my struggles with sobriety. He is extremely supportive right from the beginning. .I can tell that it bothers him that I drink..I can't do this alone..
