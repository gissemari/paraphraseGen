I'm 24 been binge drinking on and off for a year and been having lots of trouble with my drinking. The way it happens is I'll happily quit for two weeks I'll start seeing all these amazing benefits after I quit and then I'll lure myself back in with one or two sips. Before you know it I've completely relapsed. This has happened 4 or 5 times this year. I'll drink about 1.5 to 2 bottles of wine a night or 1/5th or vodka a night. I just love the feeling of being able to escape. .I also used to vape a lot when I was stressed at a low nicotine level. I quit that a year ago. I was thinking maybe I can use the vaping when I am stressed and looking to escape rather than drinking. ..I find when I have that even though it's still bad for you I don't wake up hungover. I can still function normally and get any work I need to get done completed. It's great way to take a.Break at work. I'm looking at it that way because weaning off and quitting cold turkey have not been working for me at all. ..I tried using Ativan when my cravings came back and it makes my mood swings a lot worse. I get even more angry and even more randomly at very stupid things. ..

Over the last 9 days My vaping use has increased due to not having something else in my hands. If you have stopped vaping I wouldn't use it to get over drinking. But i am sure its less harmful 
Vaping definitely distracts me from drinking. It's very helpful. Although I will admit I vape way too much. Once I've kicked my drinking habit the next thing to go is vaping. 
I do the same - figure anything short of heroin or meth is better for me than drinking.
I know a guy who quit drinking and picked up Mary Jane instead. I thought about it but it's not quite as acceptable as it seems. Maybe when I retire. For now I just try and exercise when I think about drinking.
