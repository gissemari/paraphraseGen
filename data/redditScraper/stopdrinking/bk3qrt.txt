Just reached 100 today feeling proud but trying not to get cocky lol. Never in my life have I had such motivation and clarity being sober has really 180'd my life in a direction I genuinely never thought possible. ..To all those struggling I feel your pain just know there's help if you want it and people who understand just around the corner. Push through things will be alright that's a promise!

Hell yeah congrats! This is huge! It's also my first big goal I'm working towards too! IWNDWYT    
Well that's incredible that you got 100 days! I'll bet your life is a lot different these days. Not all for the better (yet) but that is normal.  Don't get discouraged if things get rough. It happens to most of us. Just keep doing whats keeping you sober and do whats right in front of you. A support group and good counselor help SO MUCH. And open up to trusted people. You don't need to do this alone. You are on the right path. You should be proud.
100 Days!!! That is fantastic!
A big congratulations to you! And although you are a bit tongue-in-cheek about it you're right about not getting cocky. Day 100 is a huge milestone but there is still work to do every day. Now is the time to take a breath draw strength and inspiration from your OWN tremendous accomplishment and resolve to keep advancing with us down the path. There are lots of good things to find along the way. If you can get this far you can keep going for sure. If you like how day 100 feels you should try day 101. Even better. Day 102 better still!
Incredible! Now go for 1000! You inspire me
Congrats!  I'm at the halfway mark and feeling great!  Onward to triple digits!
