I was looking back at the resolutions I set for myself in January 2013 and how much better off I am now than then in terms of my drinking.  ..Alcohol had a strong upper hand when I first [posted here](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ei6ra/when_i_get_off_work_at_6am_im_not_going_to_have_a/) and although I don't pretend to be completely out of the woods I feel like I've made a marked improvement and I want to say thanks to everybody at /r/stopdrinking for their support...This sub has given me the benefit of multiple perspectives on individual experiences with things like moderation ways to fight the urge and just how our struggles with alcoholism can be both similar and vastly different...As I said I'm not where I want to be just yet but I wouldn't have made it this far without y'all so **thank you** again! Advice etc isn't solicited but always welcome.
