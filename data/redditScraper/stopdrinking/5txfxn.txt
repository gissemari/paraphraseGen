Well I've officially made it without alcohol for the longest I've went in over 10 years.  Some a couple of my NDV's...- My wife and I went camping this weekend with another couple.  This is HUGE coming from somebody that would turn the dial up to 10 when camping.  No exception.  Always wasted when camping.  I spent the whole day sipping on gourmet creme soda flavored fizzy water covered up with my drink coozy.  The coozy covered up labels and the creme soda looked like light beer.  I know it's slightly deceptive but I don't give a shit and if they brought it up and asked I'd have come clean.  I just wanted them to feel comfortable around me.  They didn't ask.  They didn't even notice.  My point in bringing this up is what I've heard over and over again in this sub.  Most people don't even CARE if you're drinking.  Most won't notice...- I went to a concert the other day to watch a friends band play.  A big one for me.  I played in bands for a couple decades and the ritualistic drinking went hand and hand with the activity.  I had a couple of soda's while kicking back talking to friends.  They probably all figured that I ordered an 'oh so classy' long island ice tea.  So we sat and talked in between songs discussed our day and had a generally good time.   ..- Several dinners out on the town.  The reward at the end of these dinners was all the money that isn't on the check!  During my wifes birthday dinner she ordered wine and I ordered tea.  Bam 2 nice pours of red wine were sat on the table.  I corrected the situation and sent the 2nd glass back.  I laughed hysterically inside of myself.  "If he only knew!?!"..Just wanted to share really quick.  I've been meaning to be more active here in SD.  I've struggled greatly over the past few years.  I read an old post (https://redd.it/42cc28) that I submitted and evaluated whether my reduction in drinking since then was adequate.  It wasn't.  I was still suffering (albeit less).  I noticed that the day that I was scheduled to return from a trip to Hawaii with my wife would be exactly 1 year since writing that post.  Seemed to be a perfect coincidence for me to really give this a shot.  Super weird side note..... I saw the Dr that gave me the news of the bad liver enzymes on the plane back from Hawaii.  That's just too weird and I chalked that up to 'a sign' from the universe that NOW is the time to fully commit...Thanks for listening to me rattle on.  I love the people and support that are within this network.  I'll try and do my part to be less of a lurker and more of an active participant...Be well everyone!
