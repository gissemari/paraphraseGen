It's been a bit if time since I've posted here. I slipped a few times and struggled to write the return post. I'll keep it plain and simple; I'm happily returning and resisting the urge to drink today.

I'm with you!
Well my money's on you cause you've got your rally cap on &amp; you're ready for the victory. :)  I won't drink with you. 
Way to go!  Good on you!
