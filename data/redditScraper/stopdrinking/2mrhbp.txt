Good morning /sd! Do you know what day it is!?! [I do! I do!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj9_yW8tZxs)..Here I am with the happy reminder that the week is halfway over. Let's share our our triumphs and our struggles!..**Triumph**: I'm killing it at work lately and I know that it's because I'm sober focused and engaged. It's a great feeling...**Struggle**: I'm struggling with how I should "feel" at 114 days. Every time I try to give myself credit for getting this far I remind myself that I've gone farther than this and relapsed hard. I'm discovering that I get uncomfortable with shades of grey; I want a finish line to cross so that I know I'm OK. It's difficult for me to resign myself to the fact that that will never happen. I want a gold star sticker goddamit! Now! *Sigh.*..**General Chat**: So I agreed to do a friend a favor and act as a wingman at a speed dating event tomorrow. The drawback is that I actually have to do it too. I'm considering coming to each minidate with some whackadoodle question that will help me suss them out in seconds. Suggestions? 
----------immediate responses--------

**Triumph:** I am doing really well at work and more importantly keeping all my promises to my kids...**Struggle:** I finally reached out to work with a counselor and after only three visits he starts to steer me toward meds. (He also took a call in the middle of one session.) What a fucking hack! Not good for someone who always considered Psychology as very close to quackery...**General Chat:** Snow more snow and cold. So far I am loving it but it isn't even winter yet. Yikes! 
Pancakes of waffles?..Asking the important questions...**Triumph:** It's my 29th birthday tomorrow and I am going to Toronto for the weekend! Very very excited...**Struggle:** Having some issues fitting in with some of my husband's friend's wives. I got butthurt over not being invited out to a huge birthday event on Saturday. I was really disappointed. I guess they didn't want to make me uncomfortable because there was heavy drinking. People don't really know what to do around recovering alcoholics sometimes...**General chat:** Steel-cut oatmeal amirite?
**Triumph:** My wife and I put an offer in on a house yesterday.  This is the first house I've ever put an offer on.  Until now I've been a renter.  I couldn't have done it while pouring $4000+ of liquor down my gullet every year.  I'm also counting down to 600 days sober.  It's been long enough that it's starting to feel like a blur of sobriety.  ..**Struggle:** Holy shit I just put an offer on a house. (Everyone cross your fingers they accept there's multiple offers).  Waiting to hear from the seller is like waiting for Christmas morning to roll around...**General Chat:**  I'm in Houston and it's cold.  Colder than it should be in November.  ..In regards to mini-date questions I like .&gt;If people were thrown in jail for bad habits what would you be thrown in jail for?

**Triumph**: 2 years mofos!  I went out to dinner last night with some really awesome people.  I'm very lucky to have such good friends...**Struggle**: I got nothing; life is awesome!..**General Chat**: My family member who had surgery last week is recovery well.  Hopefully this will all be behind us soon..
**Triumph:** I wrote a letter (for my 9th step) that I said I would never fucking write.  .  .**Struggle:** Trying to figure out what I want to do with my life. I am leaving the military and currently have no plans or direction of what I am going to do afterwards.  .  .**General Chat:** Americone Dream may be the greatest thing since sliced bread. Phish Food is a close second but still falls in comparison.
**Triumph:** Got a new job yesterday after being unemployed for 3+ months. Not my dream job but a good opportunity to work hard make financial progress and grow my discipline...**Struggle:** Health issues. Unrelated to alcohol. Injuries that have nagged me and gotten worse. My last relapse was triggered (in part) by a discouraging visit to the doctor. **I'm aware of this trigger and fully resolved to never let bad news drive me to drink again.** Some things are out of my control. I can only do the best I can. I try to treat all bad news as merely new challenges to be met and triumphed over...**General Chat:**SD has been a great help to me this week. Thanks to all.

**Triumph:** I've taken care of some long-term health issues that I neglected while I was drinking. Done with the doctor and dentist!..**Struggle:** My regular exercise fell away over the last couple months. I can feel and see it. Must get moving again...**Chat:** Whackadoodle question: Is Google right about you?
**Triumph:** I used to listen to *Channel Orange* only when absolutely fucking pilled on Adderall and coding for like 24 straight hours. Last night I listened to it [the right way](http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/wdspq/the_phds_official_channel_orange_pimp_guide/) which I *never* thought I'd do...**Struggle:** worked out at a very unfamiliar gym this morning. That was planned but still it put me back on my heels. Still counting it as a gym day but that's the first time in the last 119 days that I've missed my home gym...**General:** You should listen to *Channel Orange*.
**Triumph:** Not drinking!  Drinking doesn't help with struggles and stress and in general I have made progress this year despite my few set backs...**Struggle:**  I hate my current job.  I feel guilty for hating it because it isn't terrible just maybe not for me.  I hate it because I am not challenged but feel guilty because it is something others would probably want. I am going to school to change my career path but feel like maybe I could have done more to get out on my own. School in combination with my job is just a lot of work and stressing me out...**General Chat:**  Getting ready to stuff my face with some good food next week!!  
**Triumph**: I've gone from a girl who couldn't run a mile in gym class to running 5k in under 30 minutes! Also today my dad flies in to visit me in Arizona for the first time since I moved here 7 months ago. Since we last visited I've gotten sober lost 30 pounds and (successfully!) trained for the 5k race we're running together on Saturday. I'm looking forward to spending quality time with him instead of being distracted all week conjuring excuses to drink around him...**Struggle**: I have to somehow juggle his weeklong visit with the overwhelming amount of school projects and assignments I have right now. Go go gadget time management skills!..**General**: It dipped into the 60's this week and I had to change out of my flip flops! I left East Coast weather for *this* nonsense?
"Boxers briefs sports or commando?"..You're welcome...**Triumph:** Let's see. Next week mebbe...**Struggle:** Quoth Warren Zevon in "Poor Poor Pitiful Me" *I don't wanna talk about it.* ..**Chat:** Went to see a music show at a club last week... took a little nap in my car before going in... missed the show. But didn't fall asleep driving home so there's that. And I wasn't *passed out* in the car so there's that too. OK it was a fine evening. 
Triumph: I'm at 199lbs- I haven't weighed this since high school so the diet and total alcohol abstinence is working!! I get to take a vacation in 15 days!!!...Struggle: Not dating sucks. A guy has needs y'know?...General chat: Anyone else do non-standard food for Thanksgiving like I do? 
2 years sober today
**Triumph**: 400 days came and went without me even thinking about it. Before the smiley-star I was counting down the days...**Struggle**: Wife cut her hand last week pretty badly we found out today she'll need surgery. She'll recover fine in the meantime I just have to help out a lot more with the baby which means we both have to get up for every 4am feeding. ..**General Chat** 2 days of sub zero windchill and suddenly this balmy 30 degrees ain't so bad.
Triumph: I served dinner at the homeless shelter with a friend.  It was really good I'm glad she invited me.  I haven't really seen many friends since I quit drinking.  It's not that we lost contact now that I'm not at the bar every day - I talk to some of them on a regular basis and have been invited over for dinner (or just out) and they've offered to come see me but I've turned into a hermit.  So I'm really really glad I agreed to volunteer at the shelter the other night.  It was great to get out and see people!  I might try to do it more often...Struggle: Bipolar &amp; anxiety are acting up I didn't make it to work yesterday and didn't go out for date night.  I hid in my house all day.  All I want to do is lay in bed.  Also apparently there are roots in my plumbing and now I'm waiting for the plumber to call &amp; set up a time to come fix it.  Having people over to do stuff freaks me out but I really need to get this fixed so that I don't have to go to my parents' to shower &amp; etc. everyday...Chat:  I dunno?  This is my first time doing the Wednesday thing it's kinda cool.  I've been reading this sub every day and it helps a lot.  Why not participate? :)..
**Triumph** Bungey Jumping. My current motto is "why not now?"..**Struggle** I have gained so much weight I am having problems wanting to be social nothing fits and being fat sucks...**General Chat** IAAPA is amazing!
Triumph: I ate a healthy dinner. It's not much but at the moment it's all I got. Oh and no drinking...Struggle: I hate grad school. Words cannot express. Please just make it stop...General chat: I have a new bike (old one was stolen).
