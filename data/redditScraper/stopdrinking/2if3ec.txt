I am grateful for r/stop drinking. It is a community that is helping me get better and be better...I am grateful for the long-timers their compassion patience wisdom advice and ability to cut through the bullshit...I am grateful for the folks a month or two further ahead for showing me the triumphs and struggles milestones to anticipate and pitfalls to avoid...I am grateful for the folks who started with me for sharing their triumphs and struggles lows and highs...I am grateful for the folks who started after me for sharing their triumphs and struggles reminding me how far I have come and how much I can give...[Gratitude](http://youtu.be/ZdJ5e70Q8mw).
