Hello SD!..I posted a few weeks ago about attending my boyfriends open bar work party without drinking. There is a little more to that story but at that time I was posting from my cell phone. Santa brought me a MacBook for Christmas (I was so so good).. So I'd like to share a little more about that evening now if you'd care to read it...At the end of November My SO and I took a weekend trip to Montreal QC. My 90th sober day was that weekend. I relapsed and drank. The night of the relapse we went to a comedy club and then to a bar where a man was playing an acoustic set. I reset my badge the next day and was about as self loathing as i've ever been (I'm sure we have all been there).Exactly three weeks later I was getting ready to go to this work christmas party. It was open bar. There was no way out of it my SO really wanted me to go with him. I was terrified. After the dinner I was remaining strong while that familiar thought "You could just have one" was creeping into my head...One thing I forgot to mention I live in an isolated town a 3.5 day drive from Montreal. The nearest communities are 6-8 hours in either direction. The same four local bands play at every Christmas Party in town. .I heard someone say "Apparently the band for tonight is from Montreal".My main thought was "Oh hopefully its a band that plays something other than Sweet Caroline Wagon Wheel etc..".Who walked in? The lead singer THE SAME GUY WHO PLAYED AT THE BAR IN MONTREAL THE NIGHT I RELAPSED..Instantly I was reminded of the disappointment and regret I felt the last time I chose to drink..It could not have been a more clear sign.. I've never been religious but I do not believe this was a coincidence. Whatever it was I'm grateful for it. ..And in case anyone is wondering they played Dire Straits and The Band. :)..

Fellow Canadian! Ca va?..I had a few coincidences like that in my early sobriety. I named my two webbed toes Bob and Bill when I was in elementary school. I hated my webbed toes. I never accepted them. I grew to love them though and now I don't mind them at all...In rehab I learned that the founders of AA were Bill W and Bob. I thought: If I can accept my Bob and Bill toes I can accept these AA people into my life as well...:)
Divine intervention well done on 41 days.
