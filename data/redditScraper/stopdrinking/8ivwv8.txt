Today is the first Saturday in over a year which I woke up without a hangover.  It's been a long hard struggle and today is day 5. Last night was by far the worst urges so far. It started around noon. That nagging feeling that tickles your mind that "Hey you should drink tonight!" And as it went on it got worse. So I did what I thought was best- I played my Nintendo Switch for hours lol. But I didn't drink. And I'm not hungover. This feeling alone will help me tonight. And my Switch of course..But reading this sub had helped so much. Thank you all.

Waking up happy and clear headed has been what's kept me going. I love the feeling. I'm glad you woke up that way this morning!
Awesome. Nice job!..At this point I cringe thinking of the many times I woke up to a whole day off knowing as I opened my eyes that it was already wasted bc I was hungover.
First non hungover Saturday in about a year for me as well. Here's to many more to come! Enjoy your day
Whenever I feel like drinking I imagine what the next morning will be like if I don't. Then I abstain because I'm loving these mornings :)
