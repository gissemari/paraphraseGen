I wish I could feel better at this moment. I want to fast forward to 30 60 or 90 days. I want to believe I something to offer and I am afraid of drinking. No words of wisdom. I am simply hanging on.

Maybe you can focus your efforts and use this time to learn about the effects alcohol has on you and about sobriety?  I know how you feel about just wanting. To be cured already....unfortunately it doesn't work like that....so I am have been focusing on educating myself about this insidious disease. 
I so get that. I am back at day one myself and I just want the misery to be over. I want my sober days back but as forgivemeplease said it doesnt work like that. But also think about how much you will learn on your way to 306090 days. So much experience in resisting the booze is worth something even though it's hard to have to go through it. I wish you the best on your way and IWNDWYT.
Hanging on is what I had to do.  Keep going! It gets easier. IWNDWYT 
Keep hanging on right there beside you IWNDWYT 
Hang on in there friend. IWNDWYT   
I'm struggling today too. Nothing crazy happening just ups and downs. Just need some time alone and can't get it and it's really hard. But iwndwyt. Let's take one hour at a time!
