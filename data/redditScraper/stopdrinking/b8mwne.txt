I have made it into day 2. I'm concerned that I'm only doing ok because I'm currently really sick and having a hard time getting fluids in. Despite being sick I feel more clear aware and somewhat in tune with what I'm feeling. I have always struggled with anxiety that had gotten markedly worse over the past couple of years. I know my drinking makes it worse. I know it does...

Good for you on day 2!! Be sure and take care of yourself. Maybe you need to see a dr.
First week or so can be really rough depending on how much you were drinking daily.  Is the sickness do to withdrawals or is it due to an actual flu/cold bug?  Regardless don't be afraid to go to the doctor and let them know you just quit drinking.  They can prescribe some meds to help with the withdrawals.
