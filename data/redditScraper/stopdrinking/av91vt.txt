It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-----------------------------------------..**Struggle:** I am caretaking a beloved elderly family member and I am beginning to realize that dementia may be involved. As anyone dealing with dementia knows it's a heartbreak...**Triumph:** I just got an email from the company I am employed by that said my work has been  stellar  since I started working there two years ago. This meant a great deal to me as I had felt completely worthless as an employee after getting fired from my previous job for drinking at work (and doing a lousy job because I was always half in the bag)...**General:**  I've realized that I'm not just over the hill I'm picking up speed. .
----------immediate responses--------

Struggle today: yesterday I had a physical. My doctor informed me that my liver enzymes are elevated due to alcohol and/or being a bit over weight (BMI 26.5 so not hugely but still overweight). I'm scared for my liver and embarrassed at the damage I've done!..But I'm thankful to be sober and here.
Struggle: finding motivation at work. Performing the perfunctory actions but there is just no  get up and go'.....Triumph: have been exercising at least 2 days a week. Thank God for the discipline and focus I've been afforded...General: happy to be here happy to be sober. The worst day sober is better than the best day drunk. .
Struggle: cravings and my mind arguing that I can have one drink. It's a struggle to watch others drink with ease. I look at reminders of why i want to be sober during the tough times...Triumph: my marriage is healing and I secured an internship to finish my doctorate. ..General: it's peaceful to go to bed without the buzz of alcohol 
  I've realized that I'm not just over the hill I'm picking up speed. .I like this- am picturing a calvin &amp; hobbes style red wagon ride..Struggle: Got in huge fight with husband today when I caught him lying to me. The worst thing is that I somehow knew- lately I feel like I can't trust him or his word..Triumph: I did not drink. I wanted to VERY BADLY. I am embracing the suck and feeling my feelings instead which sometimes means crying into a glass of almond milk..General: Tomorrow is another day. I am greatful to be alive and healthy and that spring is coming.
**Triumph:** I'm getting bites with my job search. I've lined up several and I'm looking forward to really shopping around this time. In the past I would just zero in on a place to work and go for it. Comparing offers and taking my time to decide what's the best option will be an improvement...**Struggle:** Snow has wiped out power for a couple of days. The family's fine but it's been setting work goals back and put the breaks on my momentum. It's going to take a lot of work to get the downed trees cleaned up and see what damage is done...**General:** When life gives you snow make snowcones.
**Struggle:** Same old same old...**Triumph:** Yesterday I had a full fledged anxiety attack. However uncomfortable it was a comforting reminder that I haven t really had one in two months! Now *that s* something!..**General:** I m watching the Marvel movies with my oldest son and it turns out that in Iron Man 3 Tony Stark/Iron Man suffers form anxiety attacks. So Iron Man and I have even *more* things in common ;)
Triumph; Two weeks ago I went back to AA. I am two weeks sober today. Loving the meetings. Struggle: Got a lot of catching up to do with household chores etc but I will get there. General: Life is good. I'm grateful for AA again. The program kept me sober for five years. Looking forward to the future. 
**Struggle:** The country I'm living in is [warmongering.](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indian-air-force-iaf-balakot-strike-updates-border-tension-day-after-iaf-strike-at-balakot-pakistan-1999849) Worse: my father is flying up north tomorrow. Closer to where the action is happening. I tried to talk him out of it: airspace is being cleared etc; but he wouldn't have it. I'm also aggravated that I tried to get him to see it from my pov I said "would you have let me go?" And he said something to the effect of the rules are different. But he's being understanding I'm trying to keep my fingers crossed but the worst can and has happened to me many times and I don't trust either country in a moment of tension and escalation. And in the moment what I'm most wary of is letting my fear and anxiety drive me *Mad Men*\-style to doomsday-fueled self-destruction and drinking. Any thing that puts me closer to the "fuck it" moment is not helping. ..**Triumph:** Getting some work done. Spent an hour on some important paperwork and got it mailed out today hopefully I will be paid soon as a result...**General**: It would be really strange if just as I'm feeling I'm getting better/stronger/more independent things come crashing down (i.e. war). 
Thanks mary..Struggle: Took mom to dr. visits yesterday and as she only sees them approx every 3 months and she does not get out much (dementia) she seems to unload on the dr's with every complaint...some of which don't even make sense. I avoided all contact with her drs for so long that this process is still a major stress factor for me. ..Triumph: Did make some progress with drs. Eliminated one completely. Consolidated appts. and lab work with two others into a one day trip  next time around. Mom feels better...claims that her crabbiness yesterday got things done her way. Ahhh...such is life...General: Seeds started inside for garden are starting to poke up their little green sprouts!!! Spring is coming! Life is good! Peace
Struggle: Still get some major waves of depression and loneliness. Feeling very left out at the moment due to friend tensions. ..Also feeling weird and anxious about making new friends. My confidence has been well and truly knocked. ..Triumph: Finally booked another therapist session. Going for a assessment on Monday. Been doing some volunteering recently and found I really like gardening. ..General: It's so warm up here in Northern England in February! Hm it's both great and highly worrying. 
**Struggle:** Having a lot of self doubt about going self employed being skint forever and pouring effort into a creative project I've wanted to start for a long time. Ultimately I'm still unemployed depressed and full of self loathing. ..**Triumph:** Love got beer last night and I consider having one but didn't and feel good about that. The freakish spring is disconcerting but the sunshine is still appreciated. ..**General:** When in doubt write and go outside. 
Struggle: mad anxiety causing me to slip again and again
*struggle* Yesterday's triggering upset made me aware I still have some serious issues around not feeling worthy adequate or acceptable to regular folks. Going to be a challenge facing people at uni. I have horrendous dental issues is one of the big problems. People make a lot of [wrong] assumptions based on that but there's a whole legacy of growing up with abusive parents and bullying through school that underlies the feeling of being something of an outcast also. ..*triumph* I'm actually pretty organised in terms of being ready for uni otherwise without falling behind on work. I'm finding the science learning *really* interesting which helps :)..*general* kiddo and I had fun painting each other's nails tonight as a bit of quality time activity. simple moments like that can be pretty darn special. and my pretty purple toe nails will give me something to smile about no matter what.. 
That's great they recognized your good work Mary. "Stellar" is such a lovely adjective too. ..**Struggle** Sick but unable to take a day off. Probably taking way too much tylenol &amp; ibuprofin to get through it. My throat is on fire!..**Triumph** 400 days. 400 days!..**General** Interviewed someone for our front desk position yesterday and have 3 more interviews in the next few days. Hope to do round 2 interviews all next week and make someone an offer by mid-March. Having the right help will make such a huge difference in my life. 
Morning SD - IWNDWYT
Struggle: I'm starting to be triangulated at work between my team lead and another guy. I'm involved in the politics and all I want to do is advocate for my client. Sometimes it's hard because I get vetoed when I'm the one who is actually sitting down and meeting with the client. My team lead has my back but we're unnecessarily fighting against the other guy. :(..Triumph: Not drinking! That involves actually taking care of myself by lots of rest and a lot of emotions/pain are coming to the surface that I can actually process. I'm re-learning how to cope with anxiety/stress which I've avoided for years now...General: I feel some stress because I don't know if I've prematurely over-committed myself to too many projects. I'm volunteering to work in three different divisions to help out occasionally plus a side gig and my day-job. 
Struggle:  Trying to finish deadlines I am overdue on - drinking was also my way to procrastinate. I feel no reward in sight though am trying to imagine what a new reward will be without drinking - what will this look like? Still getting over the effects of a physical hangover brain fog wondering if it will be like last time I quit where I never ended up feeling much physically better at all...Triumph:  I am making to-do lists looking at ways to become productive and organized something that brings me great joy. How does one take the regret the money and time lost from booze and move into a space of self-care and self-love? I am imagining proactive ways to make the life I imagine w/o booze and it is pretty exciting tbh. 
**Struggle:** I feel a disconnect between myself and my friends lately.  I don't think it's related to sobriety although I've been a little introverted as I've initiated this process.  I feel like I don't have a best friend and I hate that feeling.  ..**Triumph:** I've gotten closer to my husband and things with my band are going well...**General:** Temper expectations with reality.  There's a difference between the way things should be and the way they are. It's important to know when to be idealistic and when to be pragmatic.
Bravo on your triumph Mary! Based on your work here it's easy to believe you are a stellar employee...My current **struggle** is nightmares. I'm just not sleeping well as I taper off anti-anxiety medication (Lexapro) and must be in a terrible subconscious headspace because I'm having terrible dreams. Like home invasion civil war zombie apocalypse nightmares. ..My **triumph** today is reaching Day 100!!! Yippee! Special thanks to SD my therapist books podcasts and an endlessly supportive partner. I did it. ..**Generally** I'm getting over a nasty cold and am treating it with wonder since it's the first time I've been sick since I stopped drinking. I caught myself thinking "WTF? I didn't do anything to deserve to feel this way!"..&amp;#x200B;
Struggle: I find myself dwelling constantly on the past. On the mistakes I've made on the things I've said on things I should have done better. I am working on being more positive noticing the positives and controlling the controllables. ..Triumph: I got to spend a lovely sober morning talking to my wife and making a damn good coffee in my Chemex. ..General: Feeling sober is so great so what is the trigger that sends me back to drinking? Need to work on being aware of my feelings when the craving hits and work through it constructively. 
**S:**  Puppy has been waking up in the middle of the night  I've got a lot this week daughter is refusing to do anything I say or ask I need a job I sliced two of my fingers open I have a zit on my eye lid (hurts way more than the sliced open fingers) and that's enough...**T:**  February is almost over.  ...**G:**  I set up a turntable in my front room.  Aww yeah!
Triumph - can fit into a pair of 33W jeans I've had for ages but been too fat for - still have the tag on. Was 201lb last week so hoping to be below the 200 mark on Friday when I weigh myself...Struggle - more of an annoyance I had (literally) a few drinks over the weekend and now I have little red spots on each cheek. I don't know if alcohol caused them but it does seem rather coincidental.
**Triumph:** Ticking along. Things are good and I'm seeing the payoff for some tools I've been working on with my therapist...**Struggle:** There's a big work project that's been back burnered. It's time to get back to work on it and I am not looking forward to it. Trying to find the right techniques to get me moving and not procrastinating further.
**Struggle:** LOTS of work I have two massive projects in addition to my 'day job' and it's stressing me out. I feel like I have no energy to do anything after work thinking about social commitments makes me cringe. Plus I have a dental appointment tomorrow and I'm afraid of the dentist (I know that's immature but still).  ..**Triumph:** Continuing my intermittent fasting aka not eating between going to bed and 5:00 pm the next day. I am definitely losing weight and feeling wonderful because if it. Bought some true-crime shows and am binge-watching them now. ..**General:** I feel much more like myself since I stopped drinking. I feel like I have unearthed my true personality from whatever I piled up on it in the last 10 years. Whether I like it or not is another question... 
IWNDWYT 
Checking in on day 2! IWNDWYT..&amp;#x200B;..Struggle: Struggling with my diet today. Thinking that I need to put all of my willpower into abstaining from alcohol first and then attack the diet and exercise issues. ..&amp;#x200B;..Triumph: I didn't drink last night and I woke up feeling refreshed and clear headed. ..&amp;#x200B;
Got plastered the last few days and my physical health is showing it. Here we go day 1 again. I want my eyes back.
Struggle: I am feeling ALL the emotions lately and it's been quite the roller coaster. ..Triumph: I got new tires on my car yesterday something I've put off for a long time and something I've REALLY needed.
Struggle:. Balancing time at work with home life.. trying to say f-it &amp; live a lil more Pura vida (for those uninitiated that's "pure life").  Less stress more living...Triumph:. Got bonus @ work!  Only been there 1/2 a yr &amp; was as much as last yrs bonus @ another company.. fir FULL TIME.  Can't take that for granted!..General: Going to play more guitar this spring &amp; join a tennis league.  Also make exercise Paramount.  Oh and IWNDWYT.  
Struggle: Breaking my bad habits and cyclical  patterns. Maybe we all struggle with this.  I think for me my OCD makes it easier to cope unhealthily when i find a way to stifle emotions through alcohol and develop a pattern ans routine with when where and why i drink. .Triumph: Though I am only 3 continuous days sober I am thinking much clearer and feeling much better already. I didn't drink every day usually but that pattern of certain days/triggers etc was harder to break than i thought it would be so i am happy for that. .General: Single parenting is hard. Super hard when you struggle with alcohol. 
Struggle: Insecure on my sobriety if that makes since. Alcohol's heavy in my field. I deal with it. ..Triumph: life in general. The world seems different. Way more engaging and seem to last longer. Im enjoying every second. ..Victory: enjoying my family sober. Ive missed out on so much. Now I'm available to them with a sober mind. 
**Struggle:**  I work full time and part time the PT job is alcohol related and while I love it I think I've realized I have to let it go. I don't enjoy my other job. Looks like I'll be working full time part time and applying for other jobs part time. Yay...**Triumph:** Told my therapist about my decision to stop drinking and got some great tools for going forward. Reward myself take my time really evaluate my cravings as they come up and allow them to pass. ..**General:** Bought my first house! Super exciting but stressful going through inspections/closing. Two extremes balancing out to a general. 
Struggle: My husband and I need to work out how we will discipline our toddler (our only child).  Hubby raises his voice and I don't like it.  I let our son play with his food and husband doesn't like it. ..Triumph: I am kicking butt with meal planning. I love my Sundays: shopping and planning and prepping...General: Ice cream sandwiches are my jam!
**Struggle:** Waiting to start my new job. I've got to wait for a criminal check to come back first and I'm raring to go.....**Triumph:** The band I play in qualified for the national finals last weekend...**General:** According to Mrs Bone women are better than men at multi-tasking. I asked her to sit down and shut up but she couldn't do either.
Struggle: went on a binger after about 10 days of sobriety. I keep getting to a week and a half and something derails me. So hello all its another day 2 for me..Triumph: another sober night and sober morning. My work days are always good when I wake up sober. I like my job and the people I work with..General: I know I am heading in the right direction. 2018 was my most sober year since around 2012 or 2013. And im off to a decent start in 2019. My sober streaks get longer and my drunk night grow smaller but im not gonna be satisfied until drinking in general is behind me.
Struggle: We still have 5 adults and 2 children living in our small home.  I know it's temporary but after 18 months of this I'm overwhelmed..Triumph: I started using a meditation app and I have a 9 day streak going.  The topics range from self esteem to patience. I really like starting my day with 10 minutes of calm..General: All my struggles and triumphs are better while sober
Triumph. Didnt drink yesterday. ..Struggle. Getting laid off in 6 weeks husband is laid off and our refrigerator just broke. Jeez. 
Struggle: I love my job but the environment and people are downright toxic and I want to leave but I have this awful inertia. Am hoping that sobering up will help me do something to get out of the situation...Triumph: Today is working on day 4 and I planned something fun for myself after work...General: I feel excited that positive things are going to start happening now...
Struggle:  I'm exhausted and stress is making my body hurt.  I also need a hobby all I do is work and parent.  ...Triumph: For the first day I didn't compulsively think about my sobriety (Day 17).  I actually forgot about the existence of alcohol for about 5 hours this morning.  ...General:  My relationship with my significant other has already gotten deeper I feel closer to him and it's become more romantic as I'm noticing the little things he does for me mean even more now and my paranoia has subsided somewhat due to sobriety so I don't feel like he's trying to play games.  He is just generally a sweetheart. 
Struggle: still not over my relapse a week ago. They get worse each time; the next binge will probably put me in the hospital if I'm lucky...Triumph: I can't safely quit CT but I've had a successful taper so far. I'm probably just a day or two away from another Day 1. I have barely slept since then so I've been all over here books and podcasts because I intend to win this time. Not many chances left and I think I'd much rather beat this thing...General: Despite setbacks I haven't given up yet. I'm still pretty young and while my habit is heavier than most I tend to be a fast healer. (at least when I don't slip) 
Struggle- I had my hair done at the salon where I normally drink wine and then leave and go next door to a bar. It literally made me feel depressed that I couldn't partake. I felt like a loser. Came home and almost cried- this is not usually my personality. So then that made me feel ungrateful in general...Triumph- lost quite a few lbs due to a lot of working out and healthy living.
**Struggle:**  I feel like I'm not putting my time to good use and I'm definitely not doing things that are making me as happy as I could. I feel really stupid around my peers and feel like I've wasted a lot of good moments in my life where I could have turned this around...**Triumph:**  *I'm doing something about it.* I'm no longer forcing myself to play through games I'm not having fun with. I'm working on and studying programming to give myself another skill set and be more beneficial to my employer. ..**General:** My grandmother once told me "Life is what you make it." Those words have stuck with me for a long time. I'm choosing to make life better.
Work pretty much sucked today. But honestly it was not nearly as bad as yesterday. Luckily my boss really appreciates me so yay for that. One psychotic ex teammate and a whole department refusing to play their part in a task. But oddly not once today did I think about drinking. Definitely did yesterday. But not today!
Struggle: Sugar cravings. I've never really craved sugar but now.. Wow. Hello Cadbury Mini eggs. ..Triumph: I've lost 2lbs in this past week. It's been hard. ..General: it's getting closer to Friday!
