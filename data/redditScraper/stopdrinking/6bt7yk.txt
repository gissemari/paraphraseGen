I went to that gas station... you know the one... the shameful one.. it was weird though... I was going in sober and better than I have been in a while... so I should have been proud - but no. Not the case I went in really reallly hammered during my relapse and the owner assaulted me? Not too sure if you could call it that if I was super fkd up... I never told anyone about this actually. Def didn't want his tongue down my throat or his nasty hands touching me but it didn't bother me so bad that I thought to call anyone or tell anyone because he bought my 4loko & I was too ashamed to admit I was drinking again? Never ever will I be in that situation again pretty disgusted that I ever was. Def not the worst thing that has ever happened to me & def could have been a lot worse. Not looking to start a witch hunt or looking for sympathy or to talk about it. I have already dealt with it and let it go but I felt like I should just get it out of my system this way since it came up today...I went to the gas station today really really really wanting to drink. I got a pack of cigarettes & didn't even look at the fridge doors. So NDV over all I guess. I got through a really rough day today (family stuff) made it through a rough week/month got this crap out of me and getting a chip tomorrow. Things could be better but things have also been a lot worst. FTZ..Oh and I had two ppl call me today from this stupid long list of ppl I have been calling to no avail. So that was pretty nice! One even wanted to go out and watch another person from our home group do a poetry thing - between Boo & my knees I couldn't but I don't think I have had a friend want to go do something without wanting something from me in years... or a friend... or going out for that matter soooo that was pretty fucking awesome. :)..[High Five](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg) & hermit no more..

Hey Red if it were me I would avoid that gas station like the plague. You can go elsewhere right? When I got sober in 2013 I was terrified I'd never go out again. But slowly the people in AA began to invite me places. I started by going to large events plays concerts where there were so many people I would not really have to talk to anyone in particular but I would see people from the room and feel comfortable. Then it was a yoga class at someone's home. Then a concert in the park. Then lunch for someone's birthday. It felt better and better and more *normal*... Then I relapsed we moved across the country and I miss all that oddly. I have not been able to regenerate that kind of thing here in Cincifuckingnati. I am not sure i need that here especially now that our youngest son has moved here too... I would give the home group people a try. It sound like they are reaching out to you!
Thank you for sharing this! Us ladies have gotten ourselves into some fucking shameful situations due to our drinking. Things I have never brought up to anyone and I just hope maybe the only other person who knows will move across the country? But never again. Go girl
