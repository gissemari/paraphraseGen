I posted here last week about struggling with self destructive tendencies. I was coming up on a year sober and had a genuine desire to throw that hard work away. ..I want to thank everyone who reached out gave advice related to the feeling. I also want to thank everyone who posts here all the time: the first day posts 100 days posts the five thousand day posts. Everyone who takes the time to express themselves and all of the awesome people who respond offering love support and encouragement. This sub has meant the world to me for the last year and is directly related to my continued sobriety. ..Thank you all!  IWNDWYT!
