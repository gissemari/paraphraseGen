You should call 911...
Is there a health link in your area? We have a number you can call to talk to a nurse for advice on whether you should go to the ER or your regular doc or what not. You should definitely get checked out. Maybe take some b 12? Every slip is a learning opportunity for the future. This will be a good resource of strength in your resolve going forward. You can do this!! 
Get to the ER
Its alcoholic neuropathy.. whenever I've drank too much and get a hangover now I get tingling really bad in my arms.. drink a lot of water some vitamins itll pass in a day or so.. just try not to hyper focus on it.. hang in there 
You'll be okay it's just terrifying the first time like what the shit did I do lol? It's your body warning you. As long as you take it easy it won't become a regular thing 
The only thing that any one of us can do is to tell you to see a doctor. We have strict rule against seeking medical advice on this site because withdrawal can be dangerous even deadly and should be supervised by a doctor. We have removed your post and hope you'll seek medical support.
