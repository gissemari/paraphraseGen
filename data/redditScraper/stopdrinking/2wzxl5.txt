i am having some very up and down emotions. i know that this is common early in sobriety as i've been masking these emotions for years. i am not asking for medical advice just your personal experiences... if you felt this way and eventually leveled off how long did this take? or maybe your emotions never leveled off? i am beginning to experience a reduction in anxiety i really hope this continues. i am sleeping better and waking up before my alarm. my skin is clear. i am happier. i would just like to feel more even keeled so i don't end up crying in the bathroom like i did last night for no other reason than i felt like i was struggling.

Think about how long you have been suppressing your emotions and how you don't really know what 'normal' is in relation to them. When I feel something coming up I ask myself what is this emotion trying to tell me what can I learn from it? I am feeling reasonably good re emotions but I'm not kidding myself that something may surface that surprises me. We are human we are alive we breathe and we feel pain. It's still early days enjoy the sleep and your lovely clear skin you are healing!
I introduced some coping strategies like mindfulness. It helped immensely. 
Hey congrats on making it to 16 days that's pretty amazing. Well done you. It's not exactly medical advice but I have found 5HTP helps with my moods a lot; although I still get terrible downswings sometimes they are a lot less prolonged and a lot less intense than they used to be. And the terrible anxiety has pretty much disappeared which is not only a huge relief but also used to fuel my black moods. Totally up to you if you'd like to check it out obviously but just thought I'd share what's been working for me. Here's to day 17 and beyond!
