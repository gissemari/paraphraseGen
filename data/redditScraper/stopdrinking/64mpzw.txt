I've been doing so good!  I don't know what my problem is but I'm closer and closer to needing someone to talk me off the ledge.  It is like you get to a point when you almost think...I've been good so long...surely I can keep it under control if I play just a little.  I know a little will turn into a lot though and that's the whole problem.  This is harder than I thought.  Just when I thought it was getting easy...BAM back to hard.

On days like that I just count the hours until I can get to bed - the earlier the better.  You'll thank yourself tomorrow.  Someone here posted this line a while back "IF IT WERE EASY   NO ONE WOULD FAIL."  It makes me smile when I see it at the top of my to-do list each day...
It's not easy but it's worth it.   42 is a good number.   Keep it going till tomorrow.  
I get those days from time to time and its fucking hard  but please don't do it you will be so mad at yourself  do a lot of deep breathing and get to bed early and tomorrow will be a new day this is how I handle those days hope this helps.
It's gets easier! Than it gets harder. Then it gets easier again! I know this cycle all too well... Remember if you feel like you're struggling it feels that way because you're getting stronger! The challenging times seem to get fewer and farther between but they do creep back in. The good news is if you can ride them out they eventually go away again :) I've been there before and I'm sure I'll be there again. You're doing great!
I didn't drink but I did go off my 40+ day sugar and healthy food kick and I feel almost just as hungover and depressed lol.  But -- I didn't drink!  I really wanted to and I didn't and that's something.  Pushing through and onward.
