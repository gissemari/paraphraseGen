I tried tapering for five years. Enough said right?..I was a solid six pack a night guy but after awhile this turned into 8-10 a night and weekend benders. I've wanted to taper for years but could never get it to work. I've wanted to quit for years but had no way out...After several discussions with my doctor she finally prescribed me Ativan (one time prescription to detox). If you can get Ativan I highly suggest it. I've had no withdrawals. I would've needed the drug without potential withdrawals anyways because I am such a neurotic mess. I think drinking helped me cope with anxiety...I haven't had any cravings. I'm not sure if this is the Ativan talking or if it's me wanting it all behind me. I can't imagine relapsing. I know what my alcoholism was like and honestly it is something I might choose to go back to some day but for now I want sobriety. I want to live a life where I'm not constantly hating myself waking up feeling like shit and being avoidant at work...I feel incredibly fresh. I feel so healthy already. My body feels more agile I sleep well and I'm more emotional (in a good way.) I'm more proactive at work. I'm about to "spring clean" the ever loving fuck out of my apartment...This weekend will be a test though. Let's not drink this weekend.
