Sobernauts:..A disconcerting thought pattern has taken root in my mind...**My brain seems to have begun to plan my future relapse.**..Despite a firm commitment not to drink I find myself reasoning along these lines:..> My life is fucked up right now. ..> I am still in school and the city in which I live is oppressive and boring...> I'm broke unfit alone and depressed...> *That* must be why I have a problem with alcohol because all those other things in my life suck...> *I don't need to stop drinking permanently* just until I fix all those other things...> I'll graduate from school find a job and move to a city that is neither oppressive nor boring...> With the money and schedule from my job I will use it buy and maintain a gym membership to get fit put myself in situations where I can make friends and find a girlfriend and afford mental healthcare to make me not so depressed...> When all those other things are fixed then I can and will drink again...**What the fuck?**..I have so many questions:..* *For you veteran sobernauts (300+ days)* did you experience any similar thought patterns when you first quit drinking?..* Can I do anything to effectively defuse this line of reasoning? What?.* Do these thought patterns ever go away or lessen?..* *For those of you who are new to sobriety (0-299 days)* can you relate to these kinds of thoughts? If so first of all I'd like to send a virtual hug your way. A self-sabotaging brain is scary and sucks..* What have you been doing when this kind of thinking hits you?..* *For everyone* finally (and I suspect that this is the question that seals my identity as an alcoholic forever) is there any possibility *any possibility at all* that this line of reasoning is actually correct? Will I ever be able to drink again? Is there any going back? Or do I just need to come to terms with the fact that I have forever beamed off Planet Drunk jettisoned my cargo and have hit the hyperdrive straight to Deepspace Sobriety?..This revelation has been really scary to me. More scary than almost anything else that has come as a part of getting sober. ..The reason it has instilled such fear in me is because if I really am an alcoholic and nothing I can do will change alcohol's effect on me when I drink then what I have effectively done *is set a land mine deep deep in my psyche* that will explode when I am just starting to get my life in order . . . effectively destroying my chance at happiness right before I am able to experience it...**Please help me.**..EDIT: Formatting grammar wording.

I've had that thought process in the past and still get them from time to time. I don't really get them much anymore but I know where you're coming from. I have problems with worrying about the future to the point where it takes over my present...I've successfully (so far) combatted those thoughts with the realization that while I *might* drink *someday* in the future I'm steadfast in my resolve to not drink *today*. Today is what I've been given and today my best course of action is abstinence.
Does your college have mental health services and a gym?  Use 'em.  If you're in a city there's probably sidewalks you can jog on.  Don't make excuses just go.  I don't know if it's related to the alcohol but I used to put off a lot of stuff until graduation because I thought leaving school would magically fix things.  It didn't.
When this happens to me I tell myself "Sure I can drink if I want to.  I can even go to the liquor store and pick up a bottle *right now*.  I can.  I can do it.  I just choose not to."..I have never actually forbidden myself alcohol.  I can't.  It's too big to think about and too difficult to understand.  I just choose not to drink today and I've done that 900 and some days in a row.
Granted I'm only about to hit the two month mark on my first real attempt to quit drinking. That said one of the things I realized is how *un*-unique I was. One of the things that drove me to give this a real go was reading this subreddit and seeing the same "unique" features I had being discussed over and over again. Many many people are sitting in the exact same boat you are in. ..I have hit every single point on your list. ..&gt;**My life is fucked up right now.**..Mine was too. With all that's fucked up certainly I don't want to fuck it up any more by putting myself through the hell that is not drinking. Drinking is how I unwind! Drinking is how I cope with the fucked-up-ness! If I take that away I'm left with a clarity that will amplify and magnify how fucked up my life is. ..I am not one for platitudes and I have never read the Big Book; however the following is true: There are no problems that getting drunk doesn't make worse. Your life is still fucked up when you drink. The only difference is you have less time money and energy to fix it. You're not ready to address the real issues in your life when you're either drunk or hungover as fuck. ...&gt;**I am still in school and the city in which I live is oppressive and boring.**..You are only bored when you decide that you are bored. From a sleepy village in the mountains to a metropolitan wasteland there are always things to do. Also are you really fixing boredom with the few hours you spend drinking in the evening? Are your mornings the next day much more fun? The only person oppressing you is you. Pick up a squash game. Find a yoga class. Learn to cook a great meal. Focus on getting all A's. You're choosing to be bored and oppressed. Things change when you choose not to be those things and take steps to remedy your boredom. ..&gt;**I'm broke unfit alone and depressed.**..I was too. One of my biggest expenses was taking money out from random ATMs at bars. Obviously I could not go to the gym because I needed time to recover from the "fun" I had last night. I also needed a big shitty meal as a reward for feeling so terrible. I also woke with vague recollections of getting pizza or a donair the night before. Also depression: Is it possible that there is a link between getting fatter/broker and feeling bad? You know the answer. ..Since quitting I hit the gym every morning and I fucking love it. The feeling of moving forward lasts all day long. I am seeing gains all the time both in appearance and strength. Depression is a fading memory as it became clear that depression was not an innate part of me: my depression was caused by my actions. This may not be true for everyone but it sure was for me. Also even if your depression is more serious being healthy can do nothing by make it better even if it is just marginally. ..&gt;**That must be why I have a problem with alcohol because all those other things in my life suck.**..No you have a multitude of problems like most people. Turns out alcohol is one of those problems and it makes the other problems harder to fix...&gt;**I don't need to stop drinking permanently just until I fix all those other things.**..And then I'll be a normal drinker. I know myself too well now for that. All of those things I "fixed" will slowly come back. Maybe you'll be one of the rare persons who can go from being a full-out drunk to being a moderate. If I was a betting man (and I am) I wouldn't bet on that for me (and I won't). I don't want to go back. ..&gt;**I'll graduate from school find a job and move to a city that is neither oppressive nor boring.**..No matter where you go there you are. ..I did the same thing. Did two degrees across the country. Moved to a third for a few "dream jobs". Hated them. Through the grace of fuck I somehow managed to find my actual dream job. Though I was drinking like a madman for my first two jobs and it could have led to my hating them because I hated my life. Even worse alcohol is a central part of my profession as my mentors and colleagues tend to hit the bar after work. I've gone out a few times and not drank. Turns out I wasn't shunned like I assumed I would be! ..&gt;**With the money and schedule from my job I will use it buy and maintain a gym membership to get fit put myself in situations where I can make friends and find a girlfriend and afford mental healthcare to make me not so depressed.**..I see no flaw in this statement. It's a sad state of affairs that you have to pay for care you need but that's a debate for another day. ..&gt;**When all those other things are fixed then I can and will drink again.**..This is sort of addressed above. My strategy is to not stop at "fixing" my problems. Life can always get better. Once I fix the cracks in my life's foundations I plan on taking active steps to actually *build* on my happiness. Drinking does not play a part in this plan. ..
What link said..And what do I do in similar episodes of diarrhea of the brain?.I call another alcoholic ( as you have done sorta). I get my ass to a meeting..I was at a meeting in prison a week ago and the theme turned to "you are responsible for your own joy and happiness" this was being said by men who have been locked up for 30 years and nay never get out...At that meeting we added. Also you are responsible for your own misery...There is nothing in your list that another binge can not make worse.
We can feel like shit or even say 'fuck it all' and still not drink. That was kind of surprising for me to really understand at first but it's true. Sooner or later all feelings pass. Whenever I drank through a hard time I've never come out the other side thinking 'boy now that that's over I'm really glad I drank through it.'..Everyone goes through the ups and the downs sober or not. Learning to deal with them sober is difficult but it's the only way through them and it gets more manageable the more we do it...Hang in there reach out if you need to. You're not alone we all help each other get through life sober. Things can get better if you let them.
I just went through the exact same thing.  Around 4 weeks I started subconciously planning my relapse.  I managed to ignore those voices for a week and a half and then bam - I suppose I could have one drink. Guess what? It didn't work.  If you're like me it doesn't work.  I spent the next 3 weeks drinking uncontrollably. Now I'm back on day 2 and sick as a dog.  I was happy. Now I'm back at square one...Look at it this way-we are walking in the forest and come upon a fork in the path. One path is long and difficult but if you stick to it one day at a time it will get easier and flatten out before you. The other path (trust me I just checked it out) is easy but leads directly to Mt. Doom. It will strip you of your ambitions dreams hopes and perhaps even your life...You've got some time under your feet.  Keep it going. If you need more help you need to use chat room a meeting anything to keep going.
Its super normal to do this from what I saw in rehab. I think we talked about planned relapses a lot with our groups and  counselors. ..You're in good company here. Just don't drink today and what you're going through is just another attempt for the addict to rear its filthy head. 
I have this thought that I'll relapse in two years... It popped in the first weeks and came back to say hi this week...The way I see it my alcoholic standsure wants me to concede accepting a hypothetical drink. Once that's agreed internally how easy would it be to bring that date forward? I'm thinking fairly easy :/..Sane(r) standsure  can hang on to the idea that I lie to myself that my brain can be a dangerous neighbourhood. There are some places in it I don't want to walk alone. ..So I breathe call my sponsor and get to a meeting. I'm in the first year of recovery and I need to bring this into today.
