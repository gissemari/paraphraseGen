I'm just checking in to say hi to everyone here and to thank you for sharing your stories feelings and support.  I cannot believe how helpful this community is.  I've also found a great "Health Realization" meeting in my town and I think that is going to be a big help as well as it tends to focus on the positive things in life which I find very rewarding. ..Thank you all and hang in there when you are struggling it will get better!
