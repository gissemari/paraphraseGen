I have been down this road before and I want to go back down it again. Sober for 8 years and recently relapsed into 2 years of mostly drinking at home alone. Today is Day One of Sobriety.

Welcome back!  ..Can you expand a little on your story? How did 8 years of sobriety slip out of your grasp? What was the last 2 years like?  ..See I have less than 2 years in and I need to know what to watch out for. I was a solitary drinker too and I don't want to go back there. If you'd rather not elaborate I understand but you are in a unique position to help a lot of us with your story and I hope you will consider telling it.
Welcome back...Hope to see you around here more often. Grab a badge eh? 
Welcome!
Your story sounds a lot like mine. Drinking home alone. I had 5 years then went out for almost 9. Welcome back!
