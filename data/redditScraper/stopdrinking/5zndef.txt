Hey everyone posting this under a throw away account but I need help and anonymously seems to be the only way my stupid brain will even ask for it..I'm going through a divorce (that I don't wan't) after 3 years of struggling with alcohol. I wan't to get clean (to both prove to myself that I can be better as well as to my wife)..Every good thing that has happened to me in the past 9 months was because I was sober and everything else I was able to ignore the consequences of not being sober..I need help. I hate that I feel so enslaved to habit and repetition but I see how well everyone on here is doing. If you have any advice I'd be appreciative. I feel like I'm going through the darkest period of my life and feel so alone (even though way too many people have been super supportive). I know there's a lot of posts in here like this (and thank you guys for being so supportive to the others) but I'm lost. I keep screwing up and can't seem to make it better but I so desperately want to...Edit: what I meant by too stupid/smart was that I consider myself smart but I'm realizing that I obviously not only don't have the tools to address this but also that it took me *way* too long to even see that this was a problem. A smarter person would have seen this...Thank you

All I can tell you is what has worked for me after many attempts this time it's worked and tbh it's been easy. I made myself my own project. It was not about not drinking it had to be about everything. I've thrown everything at myself I possibly can and it's become a spiritual mission more than anything - which I think it is in the end anyway. So taking the focus off the negative ie loosing drinking and making it about the positive - gaining control - has made it easy for the first time in 15 years. .I have practised : positive affirmations morning and night; meditation; yoga; studying - reading everything I can  very highly recommend the book by Annie grace - free on the sidebar. Watching a lot of you tube videos - try Bruce Lipton  that shit blew my mind. .Anyway the point is for me it was changing my perspective and the rest flowed. I have zero desire to drink like none I'm absolutely gobsmacked tbh but not focussing on the why just accepting it for what it is in the now. .I have also been using emotional freedom technique which I swear has been the defining factor. You feel like a dick when you start doing it but I honestly can say I think it's working. .I lost my man before I embarked on this and it sux but I have realised as trite as it is until we really love ourselves which means honouring and respecting ourselves nothing will really work. Being a booze hag was as disrespectful as I could be to myself. .It is possible and it's better. Hope some of these ideas are helpful wishing you every success      .
