One of my first sober holidays with my in-laws. I am struggling with tomorrow. Today I have committed. I just keep getting anxious about tomorrow. How am I going to get through it? Any advice?

Think about it tomorrow so you don't waste today? .
You hold your head high and be proud! Your recovery is the only thing that matters. If it gets tough excuse yourself and go for a walk around the block say you just need some air. If it gets really tough excuse yourself and go home if your partner can't accept or support that you know where you stand. You do whatever it takes to get through this for you. Spend 3 hours here checking in asking for support if that's what it takes. NO PRISONERS! :)
Check in again tomorrow. Make a plan. Remind yourself that you can outlast any craving they don't last forever. Hangovers last longer than cravings. Have something non-alcoholic to sip on. Practice saying "no thanks"+subject change. Have an exit plan if you can. Just breathe.. It's going to feel so amazing starting the new year feeling healthy and confident and proud of ourselves :) one day at a time
