I've NEVER reached 60 days my closest stints were 45 days and 30 days but besides these three stretches I don't think I've ever lasted very long...I had to go to rehab this time and then I decided to quit my job to move home and be close to family. I think a lot of people relapse because they don't make the necessary changes in their life to support their sobriety. I KNEW I needed to change my environment or I'd likely relapse again and even though I'm jobless I feel at peace I feel good about sobriety and by putting it first I know things will come together even though from the outside my life looks pretty messed up right now...I was always against AA but honestly I think going to meetings this time around is helping. We NEED to be around other people who are sober and supportive even if you don't buy into the higher power stuff. ..Anyways I check this sub daily and I'm really grateful this place exists. IWNDWYT.

Congrats on the 60 days.  It is great that you recognize the things that need to change and you have family and friends to help you in your situation.  I will not drink with you today.
Congratulations on your 60 days. You're sounding really positive good on you  
 Congratulations! My big brother went to rehab for alcohol and he has done AA and NA (lives in a rural area so it just depends what the local groups are like) for six years and never looked back. If it is helping keep it up! 
Stay strong. Every day as it comes.
