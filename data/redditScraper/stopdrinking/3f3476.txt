Just posting because I've been struggling with a lot of anxiety lately. Being off my schedule (I'm a teacher) kids home which is great but also can be stressful we have my daughter's friend here and they're starting to get on each other's nerves and thus mine (but she's from out of state so there's nothing to be done but keep thinking up things for them to do to keep them entertained). My husband is bugging me about how much money is being spent on said entertainment it's hot as hell I'm just crabby and off-kilter. ..I have no real desire to drink I just have that free-floating anxiety the racing heart the "what do I do with myself" feeling that I hate. I'm just posting for some accountability. I won't drink today... I may strangle one of these pre-teens but I won't drink.

My husband is a high school teacher and I know he also struggles with being "off." It sounds like you're going through a lot. How are you managing?
yoga or some kind of exercise really helps me get through this
