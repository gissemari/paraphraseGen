Im so used to being intoxicated in social settings that now as a sober person I have noticed in social settings at work in particular I have trouble listening and retaining the information being thrown my way. It's embarrassing. ..For example recently my manager was explaining a lot of work related stuff at the end he addressed me and asked "what did I say after I said X?" I replied "Well you said a lot of things and I think it was Y.." Like fuck man this is just 1 example that sticks out to me right now but this happens all the time where I "zone out" when important matters general talk or training is being discussed...This is going to be detrimental to my future if I cant pay attention to long talks and I am sick of it. How am I supposed to climb the ranks if I struggle with paying attention to what someone is telling me?..I like my job too so I know its not discontent...Edit// I figured its important to note that I get 8+ hours of sleep a night exercise regularly and eat healthy...

So I have heard it takes a while - up to 2 years - for your brain synapses or whatever to get back to homeostasis but this is something that I would discuss with a doctor. Might be an attention deficit disorder or some other neurological thing I wouldn't know. But it can hurt to have a doctor check it out right?
