Well I technically made it to Day 2 since it's after midnight here. But I'm lying awake with a head full of crazy thoughts about all the damage I've done to my body and mind over the years of drinking too much. This relapse was especially bad due to the physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms after steadily increasing consumption over more than a week. Night before last I 'only' had about 6-7 drinks and woke up in mental agony after very little sleep.  .I started a list of actions I'm going to take including seeing a doctor and being honest about my drinking coming clean with my therapist and starting up some sober activities. I'm also going to stick to only sober people and places for awhile until I get my head straight. The biggest fear right now is the doctor visit and what I'll learn but it needs to happen. Thanks for your support everyone.

It sounds like you have a solid plan; don't beat yourself up now.  Remember the point of pain is change.  
I remember being anxious about my health and the damage I'd done when I gave up. I sweated tossed and turned through my first sober nights I went to bed early and went through the motions of sleeping as best I could using relaxation techniques to still my mind. To be fair I wasn't sleeping all that well when I was drinking I'd wake up in the wee hours dehydrated exhausted. ..Similar to you I drew up a basic plan of action for myself including:..* disclosing my problem to my doctor and SO..* substituting alcohol with herbal teas and sparkling water ..* eating right..* distracting activities: reading netflix gaming occasional walks..* I set initial goalposts of 30 60 90 days then 120.
