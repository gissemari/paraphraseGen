I've not been sober for long but one thing that's *hugely* helped me out is the following technique that I think I picked up from Lifehacker. If you still socialize in drinking situations and with old drinking buddies take a separate wallet or purse with you. Go to a cash-point as you normally would and draw out just as much money as you normally would for the night but put it in your Drinking Wallet instead of your normal one. Don't touch the wallet for the rest of the night (I usually find that the money I already have in my normal wallet is more than enough to pay for all the non-alcoholic drinks I want for that night - another benefit of being sober!) and when you get home pop the money in a safe box or a piggy bank or wherever you feel is a good place. Do this any time you feel that you would have spent money on alcohol; I've done it for trips to the pub movie nights with friends quiet nights in with housemates meals out at a restaurant trips to the theatre (half-time glass of wine anybody?) I found that it helps to have a goal set too for what you'd like to save up for; maybe a weekend away a DVD box-set you've wanted for ages a new phone a trip to the cinema a donation to a charity of choice - anything that will let you see concrete results emerging from your progress. ..Obviously this won't help with everyone as it requires willpower in other ways nor will it work all the time with those it does work for (my last slip-up was at a place my friend worked at since she got us free drinks) nor is it a long-term plan but I've found it useful and thought it might be worth sharing. I think the main reason I find this useful is that at the point of having to choose whether or not to have a drink I find it hard to come up with any reason why I shouldn't. Abstract health and financial rewards don't stack up in the moment compared to a tangible on-the-spot benefit that I think (at the time) alcohol will give me. By using the Beer Wallet technique I have a concrete reason to reject the offer of alcohol: the money in that wallet is going to something I want more than alcohol and to pay for that alcohol I'd have to reach into that wallet and take the money away from my savings. In addition my drinking (as I expect most people's to be) is habitual. Having the money in a physically different place simple as it is breaks the habit. If you want to pay for a beer you have to reach into a different pocket into a strange wallet whose only purpose is to remind you not to drink. There's no way you can pay for a drink out of this wallet without making the conscious decision to break the promise you have made to yourself. I find that's usually enough. There can be no justification or self-deception when using the Beer Wallet and for me and for now at least that's half the battle...tl;dr - put the money you'd usually spend on alcohol in a separate wallet and at the end of each night stash it away and save up for something nice!

If it works it works. There have been some recent postings on willpower vs. attention and I think what you're doing is hacking the attention cycle. When you're out and you get a craving instead of focusing on the feeling itself you start out right away with the thought process of using a "forbidden" wallet what that money is really there for what you're trying to achieve etc. You're interrupting where the attention is going to which is key to me...Two thoughts: First for me avoiding temptation in the first place is a simpler hack than fending it off with special techniques. I hope you're building a life that includes plenty of non-drinking activities and outings. Second in the past when I used secondary goals of health or money they were only helpful as long as those areas were still issues. Once they were not I had to make sure I had internalized the reasons for staying sober. It sounds like you understand this.
