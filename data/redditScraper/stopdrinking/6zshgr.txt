i keep reading those words and they are soo true i have two weeks under my belt and i keep thinking about alcohol. the first eek was soo hard the second week was euphoric and i can start to feel the little voice in my head starting like it always does to suggest a drink will be ok. that voice is the devil the monkey on your back and it starts in your head i have definitely started to recognize that pattern in my head starting a  few days before a slip. no voice not today. i will not drink with you today!!! one minute one hour one day at a time

Yes I couldn't agree with you more!..I will join you in not drinking....here's to diet Dr. Pepper :D......and internet hugs
Totally feeling the week 2 blues here.   Could be hurricane/babysitting induced cabin fever but I'm exhausted and miserable by 3pm.   Feeling OK in the morning but expecting a struggle layer.
You have the right attitude! Don't listen to those cleva voices - they lie!! Congrats on 18 days so close to 3 weeks!! I won't be drinking any of the minutes today right along with you!
Hello.  Tell the voice that is telling you to fuckit to Fuck Off!  I've had to reset my badge and I would be way better off if I would of told the voice to Fuck Off.  It sucks starting over.
Sometimes it's so hard to drive past the liquor store but you have to!  It's all in your head. I will not drink with you today!
