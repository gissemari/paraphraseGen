Be strong it gets better   Got a meeting to go to? If not there is a chat on this site.
Hang on!  It will be worth it in the morning.  For me I had to go through some hard days to finally be free. Sending positive thoughts your way!
Just keep pushing through.  Drinking won't make it any better.  You got this.  Try some coping strategies like videos on how much quitting benefits your body and mind.  Maybe treat yourself to some really yummy food.  Iwndwyt!
I try something for a distraction go for a walk i found early on a run got the stress and anxiety to subside.  Or go out and eat some crappy food...U can do it.
counting down the minutes till 10.30 so I can take my sleeping tablet with a huge say of relief that I've made it through day 3 
It'll get better. Remember that feelings are like a tide and although you may feel like your drowning now the tide will recede. I understand how you feel. Keep looking up.
