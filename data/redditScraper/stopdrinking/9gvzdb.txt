So I am currently on day 57 and I feel great.  For me ( and I'm guessing a few on this page) alcohol was always there for the good the bad and for the "fuck it why nots".  Well after 57 days off the bottle it is all starting to make sense now.  I used to sneak drinking after a rough day to take the edge off or a great day to celebrate and it always seemed OK and what I am supposed to do.  I think this is part to do with "normal" people being able to have a beer or two to take the edge off or to celebrate and most to do with my disease to trick me into thinking that I can do it too.  I know I cant drink and I shouldn't and I will NEVER have just one but that tricky little devil on my shoulder always seemed to make a good point.  Well I have had enough of that little devil and it feels so great to FEEL the stress of work and HEAR the "bullshit" my wife is throwing at me.  Its to easy to drink and forget.  It takes a real life adult with a rational thought process to get through these situations and not sweep them under the rug to deal with in a few days.  Sobriety has given me my adulthood back my life back and the ability to tell AND feel the difference between a good day and a great one and it lets me feel the stress and learn from it and figure out how to make things right.  Alcohol is not a problem solver its a problem forgetter.  Actually fixing something or taking care of it feels so good and for me isnt possible while drinking.  So thank you everyone here thank you for reading and I hope its not to much rambling.  And one thought to leave you all on (mainly for the newer people) is a relapse doesn't start with you taking that first sip it starts when you think you are doing enough and become complacent never stop working  toward sobriety.

Thanks for this! I'm having a tough day confronting problems that need to be solved (previously swept under the rug to deal with later) and this realigned my thinking. I will not drink with you today!
It is so much simpler to deal with things process them as appropriately as our present awareness allows and make judgement calls with that awareness than it is to  sweep them under the rug' as you say.  Every day is more fulfilling the further I go even when things aren't going nicely that day.  It's pretty decent!  IWNDWYT
