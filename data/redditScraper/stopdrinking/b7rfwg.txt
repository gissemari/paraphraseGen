I am currently 19 studying in university I have good grades and a good group of friends life is supposed to be good. However I notice I do not drink for the right reasons anymore. I don't drink to have fun and black out 90% of the time I drink. I dont drink every weekend and can go weeks in between but when I do drink I go on 2 or 3 day benders. My mom and a few of my friends have notcied this but I tell them Im fine. I often feel very lonely and struggle to talk about my inner demons and booze allows me to escape reality. I want to quit drinking but am worried life will be boring. I am very worried my drinking will get worse and am scared of what I might become. For those who quit drinking around my age and in university how were you able to have a fun?

You know our society has built a nighy life model around alcohol. This is the true but!! you dont need to follow the system to be happy. There are lots of staff to do except get hammered every 2 weeks and this has to do with sports travelling even alone (keep the money and do some Airbnb in a neighboor city or country) get involved with art play some music yourself or paint a bit make plans about places you want to visit build a better body and you will find out that there are lots of people around you that do the same and eventually you will build a social life around them...you are so young you can actually do everything man ;)
I'm currently listening to The Naked Mind by Annie Grace and it's very very insightful. You should give it a try! I'm 22 &amp; just decided I'm tired of dulling myself with alcohol as well. Good luck!!!
