Hello abnormies please help. I am at 46 days and I am really struggling. I have been really angry for a few days. I really figured that the time away from booze would help me professionally and personally. I guess it has but now I am dealing with some real shit on both fronts and I am really ANGRY that I can't go get fucked up to give me a break. Why am I busting my ass staying sober if my wife is still going to be on my ass about stupid shit and I still have problems getting focused and motivated at work? Is what they say in AA true and I really am suffering from a mental fucking condition where I tend to be a sulky prick all the time? At least if I had a few drinks right now I wouldn't be pacing the floor cursing out my wife kids and myself. Where is the serenity I am supposed to have? I am sober right now but I have been sitting at an airport for three hours white knuckling it and really wanting to just check out of the whole sobriety thing for a night but I know if I do I will destroy this whole fuckin narrative that 'yay I beat my drinking problem good for me- yay' and that I will just end up getting reeeealy fucked up tomorrow or the day after or this weekend or every fucking night. So I feel angry and pissy and am also 'poor me' and that makes me even more angry because its textbook shit you hear about in AA rooms and the answer is so obviously that I cannot give up now that it makes me crazy. Argh! Does anyone hear what I am saying or is this just self centered bullshit?
