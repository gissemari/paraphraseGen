It seems like a lifetime ago.  When I look at my life now versus then the comparison is that of light and darkness.  I lived every day crushed by guilt shame and regret.  Each day was filled with scheming as to how I'll acquire that next bottle without my wife knowing.  Each night was spent hoping my kids didn't get out of bed and discover their dad slurring and stumbling.  Today I wake up each morning knowing I have nothing to cover up clean up or fess up.  Nothing compares to this freedom.  ..Even though it feels like another lifetime I know I'm only one drink away from going back down the hole.  That reality humbles me and gives me grace for every person who's ever struggled with anything.  ..If you're reading this and currently trapped like I was take heart.  There is hope.  Don't let shame or regret lead to another drink.  Let it lead you to freedom...If you're in the initial stages of sobriety and struggling it gets easier.  One day you'll look back and wonder how you ever lived that way.  ..Here's to another day.  God bless you guys and gals.
