Been seriously struggling to get past day 3/4. What have you found that helps these days when the cravings get strong and will power lower?

Coming here and reading posts helps a TON so far. But I'm looking for the same advice. You got this... I won't drink with you today :) How's that for a start?
I seem to recall day 3 or 4 is pretty much when the last effects are leaving the body.  You start to feel a little less like shit and start to think "It wasn't *that* bad".  ..Two things plan for the day being the first.  Expect and prepare.  Next play that tape forward.  3 days into sobriety is pretty damn good how does 3 days or 3 weeks into a binge feel?..To prepare maybe think in terms of diet.  On day 4 if you have been sober the whole time plan to pig out on your favorite food.  Like cheesecake?  Eat an entire ome yourself.  Just feeling completely stuffed may help you want to eat or drink ANYTHING and may help with the feelings of being deprived...FWIW I am no doctor expert or dietician.  :-)
Meetings were essential to get me started on new patterns and break those shackles.
Delay deny distract do something else.  I won't drink with you today.  Oh I'm tracking my savings too.  I'm over $600 today:)
