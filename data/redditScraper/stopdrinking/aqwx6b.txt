If you went to one this week we might have run into each other. I went to so many. I needed help. I was struggling. On Wednesday night alone I went to an 8 930 then midnight meeting. I was on edge. I was quiet. If you were there and you greeted someone or you held someone's hand or someone smiled quietly at you that might have been me. Thank you. I got through the week without falling apart.
