After tonight it will mark two weeks without a drink.  I don't really feel like I'm benefiting at all which I suppose would make it extremely easy to relapse.  That's how I feel about it though and it's a bit depressing.  ..I thought I would struggle to sleep but that hasn't really been an issue at all.  But now that I'm getting 'proper' unbroken sleep I was expecting to feel better about it.  Instead I feel more tired than ever most of the time.  How is that even possible?  I thought I would have much more energy...I don't even know why I'm posting this as it just feels like a moan and it's probably not helpful to anyone trying to give up either.  It just feels like I need to vent somewhere..

Hi I am on day 1 and new here so I don't know if I would be much help. I have bipolar so I have experienced depression throughout my life. When I am feeling depressed I sleep a lot feel tired all the time and things that I would normally feel proud of or that would make me feel good simply don't. If I were you I would speak to my doctor. I am concerned withdrawal will send my moods into a tailspin but I have been there and I know what to do. Which is take care of myself see my doctor more frequently eat healthy and accept that I currently feel like shit and need to ride it out. I find telling a loved one surprisingly helpful just to say it out loud...I wish I could send some hope your way. What I can do is not drink with you today :) I will be thinking of you as well.
