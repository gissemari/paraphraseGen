It's either drinking or marijuana. Damn it. How the fuck do you stop addiction...

Hey I'm sorry you're struggling /u/anxiousandout --it's not uncommon in my experience that newcomers struggle with getting traction.  What worked for me was getting 1 day; then someone told me about the [Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) and it got a lot easier by meticulously following directions.  
Every time something doesn't work try something new. Step it up. Keep switching it up until you find the right thing.
One day at a time /u/anxiousandout. If it is easier for you to take it one substance at a time then break it up into stages and choose the one that is most destructive in your life and work on that one first. That's what I'm doing. I'm going to get a couple months under my belt not drinking then work on the smoking. That whole time I'm not going to worry too much about eating perfectly letting myself satisfy my sweet or salty cravings. But once I have some time not doing either of those then I'll work on my diet more.
One day at a time and for me sometimes that was overwhelming so it was one minute/hour at a time
I agree with /u/jeepman4eva For me I have to work on one addiction at a time. Drinking has had the most devastating impact on my life so I started there. May 13th will the three month anniversary since my last drink (it's also  my bday). That is the day I will quit smoking. I really don't think I could do both at once. .. I honestly don't know if you can *stop* addiction or not. I gave up cigarettes for 4 years and then went back. I hadn't been able to give up alcohol for more than a day in years. I will probably always have an addictive personality but it's up to me whether or not I let that rule my life. .. I hope you will join me in not drinking today.
