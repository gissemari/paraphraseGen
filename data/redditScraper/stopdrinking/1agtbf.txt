        I joined SD last year and only lasted about 5 days before I relapsed and convinced myself that my drinking wasn't as much of a problem as I thought. Well we all know how that goes. ;)  I was convinced to give sobriety another chance by a response from one of the moderators in a different subreddit. Here I am at three weeks and it's like something has just clicked in my mind. I know that I can never drink again and that if I do  it will be the end of my life. .          What really did it for me was finally recognizing that it really was a life or death decision. I have been choosing death for the past decade. I was convinced that I wanted to die and the best way to do that was to drink (and smoke) myself to death slowly. I tried to enjoy the fleeting moments of happiness between the misery and the depression but the enjoyable moments started to become few and far between. Choosing life seemed almost impossible for me but after a rare moment of clarity and self reflection I was able to understand that life really is the better choice. Death will come to us all soon enough and it's really nothing to be afraid of  but why choose to be miserable and live as if you were already dead in the meantime? .        So here I am at three weeks and it's St. Paddy's day one of the best excuses to get plastered if there ever was one. I live right down the street from an Irish Pub and they even close the street to traffic to make the entire neighborhood a pedestrian friendly drunk fest. That being said I have no desire to drink. Not because I wouldn't love to have a beer or 12 but because I have no desire to live in misery anymore. I know that if I choose to have a beer the 11 after will choose themselves and I will be well on my way back on the path of death. Thank you SD for all your support and sharing your struggles it has helped so much.
