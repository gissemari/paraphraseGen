I've never told anyone what I've been through. For a year I was a very heavy drinker basically blacking out every night. Finally went to a really nice detox facility got clean and for 3 weeks I felt great. Sober life really is so much better...&amp;#x200B;..If you notice I said I felt great for 3 weeks. It's at this point that I figured - I can control this and not fall off the rails again so I drank. Well - 2-3 weeks of heavy drinking later I've realized that's not the case I cannot control myself with liquor. Yesterday the plan was to drink like usual and then figure out a gameplan for getting sober again. However late at night I decided what the hell why wait I'll start today. I expected a short relapse wouldn't be too bad with the withdrawal symptoms...&amp;#x200B;..Anxiety and depression kicked in which I expected. Lots of self shaming too. I walked a lot - maybe 13 miles yesterday mostly to keep myself away from the liquor bottle waiting back home. Still the anxiety made me nervous because there were other symptoms - chest pains difficulty breathing long story short I opted against the bottle to help me through it and went to the ER to be safe they got an IV in me and afterwards I went home and slept great. Today is day 2. Depression still lingers but that's all so far and I know it'll go away eventually...&amp;#x200B;..I don't regret the relapse. If anything I think it was a good learning experience to better understand that I am not above the addiction. Looking forward to getting back to sober life. Walking has been very helpful also feels pretty good to finally type out the part of my life no one knows about.
