It's been awhile since I posted but I wanted to check in and stay active here. This space has been so important to me staying sober and I'm still taking it day by day. I'm feeling grateful today that I have a new job and it's scary to me to think how I would lose everything if I ever start again so it's just not an option. Big internet hug to everyone in the daily struggle--you are not alone :)

wow great job! Feel hugged too my friend. I will not drink with you today! 
I've been struggling with taking things day to day here recently. Just what I needed to be reminded of this morning. Thank you 
Had a difficult couple of days myself. Sometimes I forget it is still a day by day journey. ..I nearly bought wine tonight. I don't even really know why. I was feeling stressed and out of sorts. I came to SD and wrote a post but deleted it. ..After reading for a bit I decided to get chocolate instead and try to kill the cravings with sugar. It must have worked because I am going to bed sober...Thanks for reminding me that no matter how far along we go it is still always only day by day. Have a great one today!
Good on you. I'm nearly at 3 years and it's been amazing how I've managed to rebuild so much of what I fucked up. Congrats on the new job. I also have one and it's going great and I'm not going to drink and fuck it up. ..But you know what? We're good enough! No reason to drink away being worried we are going to screw up because no one expects perfection just good enough. (Sometimes bloody excellent but that's just gravy:-)) 
Great job!
