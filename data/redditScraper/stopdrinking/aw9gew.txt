Hello all.I'm here for some advice. ..My mum is currently dieting and exercising hard. She's been on and off obese her whole life but struggles to keep the weight off. She seems to have replaced her evening food binging with whiskey. Being large and well practiced with liquor she can easily drink a third off a bottle of whiskey in a night without losing balance. Unfortunately that means she doesn't really realise how drunk she gets. I would say she drinks to such an extent 4 times a week (on her own). ..Additionally she isn't very kind when drunk and will preach life lessons at you and yell over interruptions for around 45 mins (as long as I can normally stand). I should note that she is a carer for her adult autistic son who is fragile. Also her job has long hours and is emotionally draining serving the community. ..She clearly has addictive inclinations. I am currently particularly concerned because even  my friend and partner have noticed. Should I say anything? Unfortunately she can be very volatile when questioned...What do you all think? Does she have a serious problem?

Well do you think that she would be receptive if your pointed out the calories in the booze as not doing her diet any good?
It sounds as if she has a problem.  Maybe Al-Anon can give you some direction?
My father developed alcoholism while practicing OMAD and Keto. Somehow he things losing weight is healthy enough to allow him to get black out drunk every day. It's unfortunate but he has chosen alcohol over his family on countless occasions. I guess he's part of the reason I'm here. ..I couldn't quit being an alcoholic until I decided it was what I wanted. I've struggled but my goals remain the same - to quit drinking. ..I know it's a common phrase here - but an alcoholic only hits rock bottom when they quit digging.
