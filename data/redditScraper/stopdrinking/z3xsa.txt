After a nasty relapse and subsequent detox I moved to a new city and am on a waiting list for a treatment center. It's a 1-2 week wait and I'm living in a shelter for the duration of that time but I'm happy I finally found the help that I need.

Stay on it man. And maybe change your user name to laheydoesntdrink :) Stay strong man. There are plenty of people who wish they could be as strong as you. 
Good luck to you!
I wish the best for you!
That's great news Mr. Lahey! I'm gonna go get some cheeseburgers. 
Could you please share how you found the treatment center the type of organization that runs it costs etc? I'm really curious.
