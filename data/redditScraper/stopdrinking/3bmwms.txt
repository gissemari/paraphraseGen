I relapsed last night and am likely still under the influence...I moved back in with my parents after my lease ended so I am here until I find a place closer to where I will work...My parents know I have a problem and I know I will get berated/abused later today for drinking again. They will know without me saying anything. ..The problem is that the yelling and abuse just makes me want to drink again. I had a year sober until I moved back. ..My parents would claim support but I told them to go to alanon and they never did. Because they still don't get it. They ask "why don't you just stop drinking"...as if it were that  simple. I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety. They tell me it is all in my head...We all have anxiety about stuff. Any medical doctor is a quack to them. Mental illness just isn't a thing they say...I know the problem is with me but my parents who claim to be supportive are only making me feel worse...I am mostly venting.

I found it impossible for others to give me what I needed because I had no idea what that was. Somehow I resented/blamed my wife for not knowing. Kind of messed up. I know this isn't terribly helpful to you but I can relate to your struggle.
What were you doing while you managed to stay sober? Routines or was it just being alone without your parents bugging you about the drinking? It going to be hard for them to ever understand what you're going through. To them its simple to just not pick up a drink but for us its constantly on our mind. It may sound bad but I would find some support elsewhere for when you feel weak. Here is a good start :)
Have you read the [Baby Steps post?](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) When I was lost the simple sober actions that I describe at the Baby Steps gave me a path forward.  Good luck.
It may seem tough and daunting but you need to start somewhere today.
