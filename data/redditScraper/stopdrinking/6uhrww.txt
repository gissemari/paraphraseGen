I am only 21 years old but I do think that I am on a very thin line right now between losing complete control of my drinking and being able to "manage it". I almost always drink on my own because I only want to numb the pain. I have anxiety depression and bpd; the whole package deal right there.  ..My dad has introduced me to the world of drinking beer wine and coffee since I was 14 and now I feel really too drawn towards all those things and I try as little as possible to go see my family because of how unstable it makes me and I simply don't feel strong enough right now. ..I had a difficult breakup recently which seemed like a valid reason for drinking but there is no such thing. Yesterday I struggle so much not to go get a drink I couldn't sleep because I was obsessing about it. It was so powerful.  I am happy I manage not to and now I woke up with only a mild headache...I really want to stop and finally be strong enough not to go there again &gt;.&lt; ..I will not drink with you today. ..Edit: words

I will not drink with you today. We're here for you!
Very good that you're aware of it and thinking about it. Try to continue be self-aware and honest as you seem now. Good luck.
