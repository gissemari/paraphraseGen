I feel like I should write a few words since I am 100 days away from being sober for a whole year. This is the longest I have been sober since I was 13 (24 now)..They say that around the 9 month mark is when people go back out there and relapse. When I first heard that the alcoholic in me cheered and said " sweet you can now go out for a drink." But I didn't. Because the fact of the matter is is that not a whole lot of us who have been handed this shitty alcoholic card in life make it out alive. But the best part is that there is a solution and there is a way out. ..AA saved my life and not only that it gave me a life. Without it my life was miserable and unmanageable. If you're not the religious or spiritual type there are many organizations who carry the same message minus the higher power aspect. ..To anyone who is new or is still struggling I hope these words hold some sort of hope for you. I hope that you don't give up in your struggle for sobriety because I know what it feels like. I hope that if you need help you reach out and ask for it...My life right now is far from perfect but I have tools to help me get by one day at a time. Unfortunately sobriety comes with feelings and if you are anything like me that is something I tried to get away from. But I can assure you that being able to feel both good and bad emotions is a whole lot better than raging through life numb and drunk...Thank you for my sobriety.
