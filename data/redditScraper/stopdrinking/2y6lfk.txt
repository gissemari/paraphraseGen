Just saw my addictions doctor for the first time since relapse/wedding...Her next recommendation is Antabuse. The goal is to force me to not be able to drink in situations like my wedding...Other things I learned today:..1.  She considers me a severe alcoholic.2.  Results from my Dec 2014 liver test were "good". I didn't get the exact numbers but she said I don't have hepatitis or cirrhosis.3.  She is herself an addict in recovery (almost 20 years) from addiction to opiates...I'm nervous about starting the med but also excited to be adding to my "sobriety toolbox"...Thank you for reading. I will not drink today!

I always thought Antabuse would be beneficial to me once I had gotten to the point where I actually did want to stop but my doctor would never prescribe it for me...I think the point of it is to help a person see how normal life can be fun/sad/whatever without drinking (if a person is smart enough not to try to drink on it and instead gets violently ill of course). And for someone who understands how bad it is if you drink on it it could also take away the constant battle early on whether to drink or not drink...Currently I am having the most intense cravings I've had in a long time even more than the last time I quit and relapsed. Right now I would sell my soul for an Antabuse right now so that I would quit arguing with myself...Good luck with your sobriety whether you stick with Antabuse or not.
Hey - so glad you're here! I wrote a post awhile ago about [my experience with Antabuse](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/14mv7c/my_experiences_with_antabusedisulfiram/). TL;DR - it's a good tool for your toolbox provided you use it. ;)..Congrats on taking this important step! Please keep posting and let us know how it goes.
