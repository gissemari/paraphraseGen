I'm pissed I did this to my brain. ..When I was a teen and smoked a cigarette I always thought to myself "I'm just doing this when I'm young". I knew they were addictive and I always viewed them as something that could 'catch me' if  I wasn't careful. And I truly was careful and eventually just quit because I was so nervous to get cancer. ..I never had that 'fear' of alcohol and I certainly never thought about a beer being cancerous.  I chugged and chugged like it was Gatorade.  I feel like I've ruined my brain. I wake up tossing and turning swearing that tonight was the last night I'll drink. I start the day out almost excited thinking "yesterday was the last fucking time I do that to myself". Then maybe I get thru that day.. but by the next day I feel it creep into my mind. "I want a beer". "I'll just have a couple from now on". "I'll just drink tonight since it's (insert bullshit reason) and quit tomorrow for sure since I know I need to quit". ..I just wish I would have known that I was setting myself up for failure when I was young and my brain was forming it's reward center. I'm pissed that I might have to struggle with this constant fucking mental battle for the rest of my life. It's exhausting. And for every step forward for every 30 days or 100 days I make it.. I just find myself right back here at this spot day mother fucking 1. Sorry for the language I'm just overwhelmed with it all. I wish I could move to some island where all drugs were illegal and set up my life there so the opportunity didn't even exist.  Alcohol sucks. Okay rant over. ..&amp;#x200B;

Alcohol causes something like 6 types of cancer ..IWNDWYT 
Worth remembering that a relapse does not undo past success.  It's easy to think of it as a failure but every time you make the effort to quit or restrain yourself you are flexing your resolve.  Don't write that off.  You're not back to square one - there is no such thing as square one.  You're not moving backwards - only forward.
