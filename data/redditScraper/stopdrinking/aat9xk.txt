Struggling with  one glass of wine won't hurt  feels just now. Posting to see my badge and I figure it's because this is a milestone for me so hopefully I can ride it out.

I had the 'one beer is OK' thought today. Got past it and it has not been back. It is like an itch I can't scratch...for a while. IWNDWYT
Today you have been sober for a quarter of a year.   . How bout that!  
I had some bumpy days around the 90 day point as well. I almost wonder if there's something about milestones that challenge our lizard brains. Day 93? No problem. Day 99? On edge and wondering if I'd make it to 100. Day 102? No problem. I'm already mentally preparing for my next big milestone: triple 1's. Hang in there we've got your back!
I am too you're not alone in this. Stay sober with me and not drink for the next 24 hours you got this
Happy 90 Days!..Be proud of yourself. This is a beautiful milestone and you've worked very hard to get here...Do something nice for yourself today - massage a delicious treat whatever...you *deserve* it my dear :).
I always think "just one glass is boring" and I know what that usually leads to.
