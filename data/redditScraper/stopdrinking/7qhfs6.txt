But I'm not going to quit.  My family came up from Florida and had an intervention.  My wife of merely 8 months caught me texting an old flame and that was the final straw.  My father stayed with me all weekend; we watched sports and enjoyed each other's company.  ..I'm currently experienced mild/moderate PAWS.*extreme insomnia*.*anxiety*.*shakes/sweats*.*depression*..I had my last drink at 9am on Friday.  I relapsed last March and was on again off again all year after a 20 month run at sobriety.  Im gonna fight through these withdrawals go to counseling/celebrate recovery and get my life back on track.  Hopefully I can win my wife's affection back.  ..I am active duty USAF (Air Traffic Controller) and refuse to lose my career over this.  That would be the epitome of a  bottom. ..IWNDWYT and thank you all for listening

Have you tried checking out an AA meeting? The people you meet there can make a great support system. You're on the right path! IWNDWYT
All of our bottoms are different and I know how you're feeling right now. I even lost my job at my bottom. You've got this. Use that support system you have - clearly they love you. ..You can do this. 
It sounds like their intervention has made a positive difference. Your life might seem like a shambles now but it sounds as if you still have everything to lose if you keep drinking. You can do this.   ..When I made my sobriety the top priority of my life I was able to quit drinking. It was hard at first but it didn't take long for me to start enjoying the benefits of sobriety. My health and outlook have improved considerably. My constant anxiety has all but disappeared. I lost weight. I feel enjoyment. Sobriety has given me so much. It isn't a cure all as I still face the everyday obstacles that we all must face but my sobriety makes it easier to handle these obstacles. ..Welcome aboard! You have a lot to look forward too. I won't drink with you today.
