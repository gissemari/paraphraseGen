I have to remember that it took me several years to dig the hole I was in and it's going to take time to progressively climb back out again. My problems today are better problems than the ones I had a year ago. I still slip once in a while but there was a time when I couldn't make it through a single day. Now *I know* that I can stay sober every day if I can just remember every day that I CAN stay sober. ..Just needed to give myself a little pep talk. Drank 3 days ago (reset coming soon) and I'm pulling myself up out of the gloom that created. Time to push forward.

&gt;My problems today are better problems than the ones I had a year ago... Time to push forward. ..This resonates with me thanks for the comradery!
I know it seems so simple but each day I wake I ask myself if I regret not drinking the night before.  Each morning that is an easy question to answer.  ..It sets me up for starting the day on a positive note and can help push through those temptations when I say if I drink today will I be happy with that decision tomorrow?..The only that separates the two (now and tomorrow morning when you will be glad you didn't give in) is going to bed and sleeping.  It's sort of amazingly simple when thought of logically in those terms.  For someone like me who has a very analytical mind somehow this thought process helps...Best of luck and IWNDWYT!
