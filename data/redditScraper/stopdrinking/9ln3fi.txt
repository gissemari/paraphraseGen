Bloody joking obviously. It's been work but I'm so glad to have 123 days. I've been through a few firsts already (parties birthday funeral etc.) every sober 'first' is progress. By the time my first Christmas comes around I'll have over 6 months. ..I'm so glad I asked for help went through detox and chose to work for this new life. There's still a long way to go and I'm still struggling with anhedonia and anxiety but that's okay. As I read somewhere on here - I walked 10 miles to get into this mess I'm prepared to walk the 10 miles to get back out. ..Thanks to everyone here for being excellent support. Cheers   (not to worry that's my fizzy apple juice  )
