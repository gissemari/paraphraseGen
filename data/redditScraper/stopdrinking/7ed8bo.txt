Hey everyone. Like most I feel motivated to post about my 100-day success...While some days have been a struggle I've been able to make it due to this community. I regularly  read other people's posts in time of weakness and I've been able to pull through some really hard days...Also I enjoy reading about everybody successes because it pushes me forward and makes me realize how much my life is better now without alcohol. I just wanted to take this time to thank everybody who is active in this community.
