Sorry if this is a boring read posting stuff like this helps me feel on top of things. ..Today is officially the start of my university's freshers week. All my housemates will be drinking heavily and going out. My house will be full of people pregaming. Sometimes I feel like I'm too young to struggling like this but I've been binge drinking since 14 and for the past 2 years it was 2 or 3 black outs a week every week. I want to start my final year of university sober and in control of my life and my actions. ..I still check this sub daily and I haven't been struggling with temptation too much as I am still filled with a sense of dread and anxiety when I think about the last time I drank. But I'm worried that by mid week I'll have a lot of "FOMO".  But for today I'm okay. I have some art stuff to do and I'm going to start my course reading. ..I will not drink with you today. ..

there was a great post on here recently about having to be sober vs getting to be sober......its a change of mindset that is needed and may well be very helpful with the FOMO....will try to find it for you
I think college students have the toughest battle on the sub. I already had a problem in college but there was no way I was giving up my every night bar habit with friends and women.
