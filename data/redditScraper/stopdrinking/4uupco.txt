I've been feeling restless in general lately. I'm working two jobs. Writing poetry for a reading tomorrow night and just wrapped a play that got a lot of praise. All the same everything feels boring and lacks fulfillment. .To top it off the girl I'm seeing just told me that she still has feelings for her ex. While I understand her situation (I just got out of a long thing right when we started seeing each other) I'm feeling pretty letdown and stupid for falling for her. (To clarify she says she feels the same about me). I dont know if we should split up or not so that she can figure herself out. .All I know is that these feelings and situations are like a fuckin relapse mind field. I can't give up the person I've become over the past 5 months. I need to keep my sobriety because without it all the things I want in life are unattainable. I'll be back to stagnating. Sitting and watching and hoping my life makes a change for the better while I drink myself to an early death and continue other self-destructive patterns..You all help me more than you know. Not really looking for advice but if you wanna share Experience strength and hope please do. Just sharing to stay accountable. Be well everyone! I ain't drinkin that poison with ya today.

Great accountability post! Sounds like you got a lot on your plate at the moment. And one thing for sure adding alcohol to the equation will not help with any problems. I'm right there with ya...no poisonous liquid shall enter my body today!

All I know is any time I ever drank over a relationship I ended up even more confused miserable and depressed.  Nothing is worth drinking over.
