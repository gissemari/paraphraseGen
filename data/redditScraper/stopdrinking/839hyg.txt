I came very very close to relapsing tonight. But before I did I came and read some posts on this group and it gave me the strength and insight to realise it's not worth it. To fight through the urge and make it till tomorrow..So thank you to each member thank you to each person that posts their stories it does reach people and makes a difference regardless of upvotes..Thank you to all that respond and thank you to the admins..This group has saved me again so thank you..I will not drink with you today.
