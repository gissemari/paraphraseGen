Just wanted to share my story to put it out there so I can make a fresh start. After almost 2 years sober through AA I slowly stopped going to meetings (partly due to a breakup with another AAer) and was dry for a while (as in not drinking but not working on myself). And then around this time last year I convinced myself that I could drink *sometimes* now that I had gained such great emotional stability from AA during my sobriety.... (Ha.) ..I did the "controlled drinking" thing for a while (once then twice a week) and it worked for a while. But then shit hit the fan in my current relationship in the last couple months my anxiety ramped way the fuck up and I started drinking a bottle of wine a night alone or sometimes two occasionally more... just like it was before I got sober the first time. Nothing had changed...So the one saving grace here was that I had told myself before I started drinking again that if I ever missed work again due to alcohol I would go back to AA no exceptions. So Thursday night I drank Friday I missed work and Friday night I went to a meeting and another last night and going again tonight and so on and so forth. I just hope it sticks this time...I guess I'm putting this out there partly for selfish purposes to satisfy my need to vent partly in case it resonates with someone who is considering drinking again or is coming back after going out. ..So I'm focusing on what feels good. It feels good to not feel sick today and it felt good to spend time with old friends and other people working on themselves it felt good to be honest with myself and others for the first time in many months..bonus: I'm already losing a bit of weight.

Welcome back!..Keep coming!
Your story sounds a lot like mine - nearly 2 years sober then occasionally wine here &amp; there. Bar relationship issues at the beginning of summer &amp; boom. Full relapse &amp; I'm pissed at myself. I'm on day 2 after drinking almost every day for the past month. ..We got this. We know what to do &amp; now we know what happens if we get off course. I will not drink with you today :)
