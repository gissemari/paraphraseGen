Hey /stopdrinking.  Lovely community and I am glad to join your circle...This is the first year that I was able to maintain sobriety for more than 4 months straight.  But then I slipped up: I relapsed.  Since then I've relapsed repeatedly.  It's become much more difficult.  ..Shame does not equate to incentive that much I know.  And I've since realized that lying or shying away from admitting my relapses only contributes to continued drinking and guilt.  It's been suggested that I become more involved - and thus more accountable and responsible - within AA: this has helped some.....So for those that have relapsed what has aided you in lasting recovery?  I know relapses happen - it's ~~married to addiction~~ often part of addiction - but I am curious as to what you all may have experienced and learned concerning such episodes.

Hi and welcome.  Very glad you are here.  I have not experienced what you have gone through but this......&gt;Shame does not equate to incentive that much I know. And I've since realized that lying or shying away from admitting my relapses only contributes to continued drinking and guilt......this is so very true.  Thank you for saying it...Good luck!
For most of us relapses are part of the journey. Ask any addiction specialist and they will tell you that almost everyone experiences a relapse...Beat yourself with a feather not a hammer. Four months is awesome and I recommend coming back to sobriety focusing on the months you had not the relapses you had. View the relapses as "field work" in proving to yourself that sober life is the only way for you...Attend support groups like AA or the SD chat (see sidebar). These were key for me.
Better to come back and have a couple days of actual sobriety than to continue blotting out existence until the miserable end. Welcome back \o/.  .September was bad for me. 4 friends of Bill's ended their life rather than come back. I take that as a reminder that I am just a slip away from following their footsteps :/
Relapse is not necessarily "married" to addiction but yes it is common. Thanks for your post. 
Hey welcome /u/povertyofvocabulary I came back after 7 years of relapse and because I rigorously practiced the [ideas at the Baby Steps that I was able to get and stay sober.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2gg9tp/where_to_start_stopping_the_baby_steps/)
Get back on that darn horse and ride.  ..The thing about relapse is that you never have to feel like this again.  It can be a learning experience and you can do something different next time.  Glad you are here.
