Just thought I would post an updated of my experience thus far of quitting drinking smoking and cutting down to one cup of coffee a day. Its nearing one month now on the 13th of April and I am feeling great. In terms of drinking I was very much a social binge drinker plowing through 6+ alocholic beverages each Saturday or Friday night and dealing with a crippling hangover for 2 - 3 days after that then sometimes having a mid week horrah as well with a couple of drinks. I also smoked around a pack a night on those binge nights (it wasnt every weekend but definitely every second) and have been doing that all throughout my 20s I am now 30. Aside from those binge sessions I have been a generally healthy person exercising a little (but couldnt get fully into it as I would let myself down with my binges and feel generally too unwell/tired and then consequentially demotivated) I eat a primarily plant based diet and dont have any outstanding health issues that I am aware of aside from panic attacks/anxiety bit of depression which I known for a long time is a result of the binge drinking... anyway I digress... When I first quit a month ago I decided to up my exercise as I have been lurking in reddit and have read a few times that this is a great way to stay motivated and its true it really is and has worked so far and I am staying consistent with it without having the crippling hangovers to contend with.. I am up to running around 3 - 4k without having to stop at a moderate pace and want to improve on my times/speed. The additional spare time I have accumulated is amazing. I have so many hobbies and plans and etc getting done and I am now looking forward to doing because I am not scared I will start and then be too hung over to continue or will become demotivated due to mood slumps caused by my binge sessions. The social part is still tricky and I have become a little bit reclusive socially I refuse to go out at night or anywhere associated with drinking at the moment because it is all too fresh and I just dont feel ready. My partner is going to watch a game tonight with friends which I would usually be excited about going to but mostly because it would be a socially acceptable event for a binge session and I could get my fix of ciggarettes & alcohol. Ive decided not to go I just dont feel ready and I do feel like I am missing out and a bit sadened by it. But I am just hoping my confidence will grow as time progresses on this journey that I will feel strong and confident enough in myself to not feel like I am missing out.... The more I think about it I am sad I am missing out watching the game with friends but definitely not the drinking/smoking. There are just so many benefits already from stopping I have been waking up naturally at 6:15am when previously I was a 8am-struggle out of bed type of person and I can keep concentration all through the day at work ALOT easier then previously. The cravings are starting to subside and I have remained fully conscious of all the types of cravings including some which were me trying to create stressful situations for myself so I would feel compelled to binge. Anyway theres a rant and general thoughts about quitting I thought I would pop on here as I have been lurking and really enjoying reading what everyone else is going through in their sobriety. :)

Almost a month *and* it sounds like a lot of good is happening -- double fabulousness. Props to you for protecting your sobriety by staying away from the very situations that led to trouble in the past. From my past experience I too went through a reclusive patch as I worked out how to be with people and without alcohol. This time I added a bunch of non drinking activities to my week *before* I quit and it's been much smoother/ less isolating socially. ..Thanks for sharing.
It sounds like you are doing a lot of really good things and avoiding situations that could be tricky.  I see a lot of good coming out of this approach for you.  Excellent stuff.  You should be proud.
