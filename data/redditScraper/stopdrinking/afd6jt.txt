Bowling is fun.
dance classes?
Cook a new/challenging/fancy meal. Learn to make your favorite dessert. Go to the movies. Paint pottery. Take a yoga/fitness class together. Hiking and a picnic. Aquarium or museum. Go shopping and buy something for one another. Comedy show (this one may be triggering?) Plant some succulents or herbs in pots. Bowling. Indoor go-kart racing. Rock climbing gym. Hmmm... that's all I can think of for now but I may come back to add some more!
Bowling.Movies.Mini golf.Skating.Skiing.Mall.Dinner...Literally everything in life you can do without drinking except for... drinking 
Dog sledding.Skating.Skiing.Snowshoeing .Skidooing.Tobogganing.Tubing.Nordic..
Massages a bubble bath a fire place or lots of candles!   
Do you have any Escape Room places by you? Those are a lot of fun and make you really interact with your partner!
bowling.
Become a tourist in your own city! Or the one nearest to you. Look at the paper for best things to do over the weekend. Plays museums new restaurants great hikes or free classes. Comedy shows free open mic nights for musicians. ..Or look for a close road trip that may be a new place for you! It's amazing how many activities open up to you when you don't have to worry about driving or plan where you can get your next drink. 
My fiance and I love to grab brunch then treat ourselves to mani-pedis. Arcades are fun too. 
Go for a drive to somewhere new agree to share the driving :)
