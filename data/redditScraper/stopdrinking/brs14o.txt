Today I reset my badge for the first time I made it to 10 days then I had a drink followed by a few days of light drinking. Today I reset my badge as I'm sitting here reading thru the thread I'm sure many people have had their first badge reset and felt a little defeated. You stop drinking and think your life will instantly improve and everyday I struggle with this feeling but this group had kept me going on. I said to myself  welp time to start this all over again.  But in reality my number might be starting over but my journey with sobriety isn't. There's a quote I thought of while typing to get my badge reset - Life's a journey not a destination and I think that really really applies to sobriety in so many ways....Sobriety is a journey not a destination.

Doing the same friend...but today we'll get through it without an alcohol. IWNDWYT
I am in a wave of light drinking...2 gins..trying so hard to stop totally.
Sobriety is a journey and things get better and better because of the principle of accumulation.  I can't accumulate if I stop this momentum and go backwards.  That's my theory
