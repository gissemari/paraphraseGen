Trust trying to keep myself accountable. I'd had a good few weeks with sobriety earlier this year and I allowed myself to slip up. When I did I stopped posting here until I relapsed this weekend. I wish I hadn't. I wish I had gotten back on the wagon and kept coming here. That was the first big sign I was in trouble. I was hiding from you all. ..I'm trying a daily accountability thing. Posting here at least once a day and going to an AA meeting. Just trying to keep my sobriety at the top of my mind right now and trying to find any sources of support I can. ..IWNDWYT.
