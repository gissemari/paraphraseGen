Hi I'm new to this group and just about 2 days sober. I'm a sporadic binge drinker and while I consider myself a high-functioning alcoholic this time I really want to completely go clean and give up alcohol forever. I read about this group online and from what I'm seeing it looks like a great place to grow during struggles with alcohol and to come for support. I hope I can offer others help as I come alone in my journey as well. Looking forward to a bright and sober future <3
