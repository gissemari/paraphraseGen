I've had a long road here lately. I've tried to stop two times now. Then I always relapse. Most recently I was drinking a gallon of vodka every two days. I have empty bottles scattered all around my house. Now they're just a reminder of how deep or a hole I've dug for myself. I'm all alone. Living a life of a closeted alcoholic. No one knows exactly how much I've been drinking except me. But it all stops today. I hope. I want a new life. I want a life without drinking. I want to be able to enjoy my life to the best of my abilities. I want new hobbies and friends. ..I just want to live.

It can be done. Keep posting!
The fact that you are trying again proves you are still very much in recovery.  You're not starting fresh; you're continuing.  ..Perhaps it's time to look at the issue from a different angle if you've relapsed twice?  Sometimes people are insular about their alcohol issues because they feel embarrassed or ashamed so they don't seek outside help.  The thing is that there are a lot of people out there who are ready willing and able to help and wont judge you. ..If you haven't maybe it's time talk to your doctor about some assistance or to check out a local AA meeting or similar.  ..Good things are set to happen for you.
It can be done. Turn want into will do.  Stay here and read post participate. Try a meeting if you can. One minute hour morning evening day at a time. There's so much support here.  IWNDWYT.
