I see a lot of Friday blues posts or down posts and I wanted to share [for the first time!] my positive story for those feeling a bit down or alone. Thanks for reading. ..Then & Now ..Three months ago I would have been out drinking getting hammered sending angry text messages waking up with shame and remorse. I would have convinced myself that this time would be different and inevitably it wouldn't have been. I would have told myself that I'd only have one or that if I drank I wouldn't repeat the same behaviors. ..And then I would. ..Two and half months ago it happened again after a long stint of being sober. I went sober again for two weeks then drank again. A few drinks with a family member I hadn't seen in a while. It was nice to see them but the drinking didn't do much for me. I actually didn't even like it. ..And I wanted to remember our being together. I wanted to appreciate it. ..The next day something changed. ..A little over two months ago I went alcohol-free and have stayed that way since. I take it moment-to-moment and sometimes it's hard but so far I've decided every moment that not drinking is the best choice for me. ..Three months ago I would have hated the idea of sitting in on a Friday night and not drinking. The sound of my thoughts bouncing off the inside of skull would have sent oft-repeated mantras of self-loathing shooting down my spine and reverberating through my being. I would have longed for ANY escape out of the situation. I would have turned to alcohol. ..Now I struggle. I sit with discomfort. I think. A LOT. I hurt. But importantly I feel. I allow myself to experience the discomfort the angst. I've come to appreciate it. It means growth. It means brushing up against the edges of our identity and getting intimate with the places I used to ignore. From that challenge has come growth. ..But fuck it isn't easy. It's ugly. ..But it's better than three months ago. So so much better. ..If I feel the lows I feel the highs and they are so so sweet. The sunsets I missed. The smell of the flowers. The colors after a rain. Life couldn't possibly be this good. But it is and I am grateful. For all of it. The highs and the lows. Because I feel. ..Now I'm more connected with friends and family. We talk honestly. I experience gratitude for my life. In short I'm happy. Truly happy. For the first time in a long time. Maybe ever. I'm present. How many conversations had I missed? Secrets? How many romantic partners had I ignored? Missed out on? How many friends hurt? Family members let down? Moments missed? I saw a friend this week that I hadn't seen IN A REALLY LONG TIME. When I told him how much I missed him and how long it's been he told me it'd only been a week. I laughed. I've done so much I told him. Yeah he laughed. Funny how time works like that. ..Time has slowed down and moments have expanded because I'm present. ..Today I spent the day hiking with a new friend I made. It was a hike I had done a dozen times before. Today I saw it for the first time. It was the first time I had done it since I stopped drinking. There was the waterfall I never noticed. The pathway that ran to a boulder that looks out over the whole city I always walked past. The dog bowls with water at the top. We sat at the top and talked for two hours - about life meaning purpose. I didn't think about a drink once. I didn't wish to be anywhere but where I was. ..Tonight I stayed in sat on my couch with a textbook and read for the class I teach. I had a burrito a cup of tea and an ice cream sandwich. I didn't have a drink. I watched an episode of my new favorite television show. All alone. And my night went exactly how I wanted it to. ..Tomorrow I will wake up refreshed go for a short run as the sun rises over the ocean review my notes for class as my coffee brews teach and get a massage afterwards. ..One week from Sunday I will run a half-marathon. ..Now my life is better. I am not a drinker. When people ask me to join them for a drink I say No I don't drink. It's not that I can't it's that I don't want to. Sometimes I miss it and then I remind myself of how much better everything has gotten how I like myself love my friends and wouldn't trade my life for anything. ..I will not drink with you friends.
