Long update to follow...**Too long don't want to read?  Short version:**  Relationship problems health problems no matter how bad it is possible to stay sober because getting drunk doesn't make the problems go away it just postpones and makes it worse.  Staying sober has had amazing long term benefits for me.  I'm not drinking today.  Are you with me?..**********.**Long Version**..A month ago I posted this.  ..https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3a8pw1/hi_im_mouse_im_an_alcoholic_and_i_want_a_drink/..The 4 weeks since have been a challenging ride.  ..Spouse had been diagnosed with Chronic Graft vs. Host Disease as a side effect of his stem cell transplant and he was sick off and on but wasn't listening to me to take care of myself.  It is hard to see someone you love be sick and in pain daily.  ..Shortly after that post I hit a breaking point where I decided I MUST get away for a while or I was going to lose it.  I HAD to take a vacation..just to escape and have some fun away from our daily challenges my work problems and have some time for us to spend quality time together.  So I booked a mini vacation for July 4th weekend.  ..One week before our mini vacation Spouse and I both got sick with colds.  I kept the cough for a while and it still lingered during vacation...but Spouse didn't bounce back and was very very sick. We still went on vacation but about 75% of it was spent with hubby sleeping and me stuck in the hotel.  ..I posted this.  ..https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3bxzy1/taking_a_mini_vacation_night_1_sober_dont_panic/..I was frustrated and felt cheated of my "escape vacation" and quality time but in retrospect the time we DID have together when he was awake and we went to the boardwalk or did some shopping we held hands.  We talked.  I saw lots of bars and lots of liquor store and yet I stayed sober.  I used the resources I needed to stay strong when I got frustrated on vacation...I talked to my sponsor I chatted on IRC posted here on /r/stopdrinking and I relaxed when I could.  ..We came back from vacation...and that night my laptop died.  (*headdesk*)  So an unexpected expense which is why I've been out of touch here on SD for the most part.  It is tough to write a post from my phone.  ..In the 2 weeks since vacation Spouse's health has been a continued struggle.  He continued to have a terrible cough lost even more weight was barely eating due to nausea and stomach troubles and wasn't getting nearly enough fluids into his system.  Last Monday things came to a head and I took him to the hospital.  He has been in for outpatient IV fluids 3 times since then and has FINALLY turned the corner and is feeling better.  ..I had a number of "I Told You So!!" opportunities.  I have been trying to get him to eat and drink and take better care of himself...knowing he'd end up in the hospital if he didn't but things played out differently than I wanted.  But saying "I told you so" is not productive.  I have worked hard to take care of him and do what I can to make him feel better.  ..I have continued attended AA meetings talked to my sponsor kept a non alcoholic beverage on hand at all times work to cultivate and nourish the friendships I've developed in recovery as well as the friendships I've kept from "my old life"...the friends who haven't blinked an eye at supporting my sobriety.  The friends who voluntarily choose to not drink around me.  I work the 12 steps currently making amends to those I've harmed and I'm amazed at how my life improves as I dig out those old resentments and guilts and repair the relationships damaged from my drinking days.  ..I no longer try to reach out to my old drinking buddies.  They don't invite me to join them or go to parties and I'm ok with that.  I see their posts on Facebook talking about how hungover they are or laughing at the poor choices they made the night before bragging about the amount they were able to imbibe before forgetting the rest of the night and I no longer am bothered by the loss of contact.  I don't need that in my life and I keep them as FB "friends" because those people are reminders of the life I'd fall back into if I picked up a drink.  Hangovers blackouts drunk driving and embarrassment.  No thanks.  ..This past month since our near breakdown my husband and I have been talking and starting to have trust grow between us for the first time I can remember...and spending more quality time together than ever.  We've been affectionate communicative...and we have both reached a point where we finally recognize how much the other person is important.  ..Yesterday was our 11 year anniversary of when we began dating...and he told me a few days ago "I don't know where I'd be without you."  It is the most heartfelt touching thing he has ever said to me I think.  We've also realized the importance of physical touch.  Hand holding hugs snuggling...even if there can be no more than that we are connecting and I feel like I'm finally receiving nourishment of something I've been starving for for years while I stayed isolated inside the bottom of a bottle.  ..So I am repairing relationships some of which I never thought could be recovered.  I'm still strong.  And I'm living a life without regrets.  If something terrible happened today I can honestly say I've been doing the very best I can to be a good person care for those I love and as they say in AA "Do the next right thing".  ..Living a life of no regrets.  Did I screw up in the past? Yep.  Can I go back in time and undo it? Nope.  I can only move forward fix what I can improve myself work to be honest trustworthy and a good friend/family member/spouse.  I will wake up tomorrow hangover free knowing I did the best I could.  Perfect? Nope.  But I'm trying to be the best NonnyMouse I can be Today.  Just for today...I'm going to hug the people I care about.  ..I'm going to be responsible and reliable as best I can.  I'm not perfect...but I'm doing my best...I'm not drinking today. ..Stay sober my friends...Mouse..
