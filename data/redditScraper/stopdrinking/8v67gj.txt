And I will remember every second! Not that kinda hazy memory I would have had if I had my buzz on which was pretty normal I'm horrified to say:( still struggling with the guilt of drinking around my kid but it's getting much better as I'm replacing that with a sober mommy. ..

How wonderful that you will have this memory sober.  Here's to many such milestones in sobriety! IWNDWYT 
Awesome! Enjoy every moment. I'm 8 weeks pregnant and can't wait for those times :)
First steps are awesome! IWNDWYT!
