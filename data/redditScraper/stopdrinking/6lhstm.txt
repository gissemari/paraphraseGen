I was at the gas station to buy candy which was right by the fridge that had these bright colored wine coolers on display and it caught my eye. It looked like fuckin Kool aid like it was just eye catching. I had to have it. So I bought it and walked out the store then reality hit me and I thought "what the fuck am I doing" then threw it away. Now I feel guilty for even buying it in the first place and wasting 3 bucks. Damn those alcohol companies for making their poison look so appealing. Like for fuck sakes it literally looked like kool aid not booze and it was on display intentionally to catch your eye. Fuck.

that sucks. good you threw it out though. I've found myself staring at the drinks in the alcohol section but never buying. I think if I were to buy something I'd end up drinking it too. good job for tossing your's 
Good one.  I'm glad you caught yourself in time.  You can get a badge if you want one in the sidebar.  I won't drink with you today.
