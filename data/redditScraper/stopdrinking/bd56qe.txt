I started drinking when I was 19 and I started quitting drinking when I was 19.  I'm now 36 and still quitting. ..There is a line in the Big Book that goes something like this: "Quitting drinking is no great feat.  Staying quit that's the trick." ..One thing that's always hindered me is how drab and unexciting sobriety is.  More than that it's just unsatisfying.  The first few days of sobriety were filled with relief and promise.  An absence of pain discomfort and bullshit was enough.  But it's not enough for long.  Sooner or later (and in my experience usually sooner) you want more. ..Meetings are great and working the steps and/or doing other recovery program activities really work for some people.  But it seems to me that everyone could benefit from making sure other aspects of their lifestyle aren't too out-of-whack.  When your life is more rewarding more pleasant overall there's less reason to return to the familiar comfort of drunkenness. ..For me this meant primarily two things: (1) Cutting down on (but NOT eliminating) caffeine; and (2) eating better.  More specifically on point (2) I found that it really helps to eat a hearty but healthy breakfast and lunch with plenty of protein and healthy carbs in both meals.  Now even with much less coffee (just two cups most mornings and nothing after noon) I have more even steady energy throughout the day.  I never get fatigued in the afternoon anymore and feel pretty good overall.  In fact I haven't felt this good ... well ever. ..I've heard some people advise ignoring other vices early in recovery and if the vice is particularly hard to quit (like smoking) and I can see the wisdom in that approach.  But if you can adjust your lifestyle for the better in other ways and it isn't too difficult to do so it seems like a good idea to try.  Might just prevent a relapse.

I agree completely with this especially the last paragraph.  For me the change in diet and quitting smoking (2 days after alcohol) really accelerated the positive change and thus the reward.  It's not always wise to throw too many things in the basket for change and had I failed at one I would've been OK with that.  But for some (and me in the past) that would've been an excuse to give up altogether.  The journey is just so different for everyone.  Good luck and well done on over a year!
