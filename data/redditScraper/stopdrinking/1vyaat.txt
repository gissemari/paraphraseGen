I've read the Big Book NA Basic Text Living Sober Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions and I pick up Daily Reflections when necessary.  Recently I've been struggling (happy to say I haven't drank/used) but a fiction or non-fiction about addiction would be great.

*Parched* by Heather King is a memoir about alcoholism. It's very good. 
Thank you for asking this question.  ..Please look up The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business by Charles Duhigg...It is a fascinating read about the science behind habit formation.  I wish everyone in recovery would read this book.  Not because it will cure you but because it will help you understand the hows and whys about your disease.  It will help explain why relapse is so prevalent.  It has a section of the book that discusses AA and why the formula designed by AA is so effective when it is used and followed.  As an atheist in AA I found the science to be very helpful in allowing me to grasp why a program like AA was important to my sobriety.  It really is a great book.  I hope other people can benefit from it.
*Under the Influence* by Ketcham and Milam. This excellent book helped me understand and accept that I had the disease of alcoholism.
Drop the Rock about character defects and gives good particle examples. I can only read a couple of pages in that book and have to put it down and think about what it just said.
Friend gave me this one I really found it inspiring - http://www.amazon.com/The-Answer-Model-Path-Healing/dp/0982296010 
[Drinking: A Love Story by Caroline Knapp](http://www.amazon.com/Drinking-Love-Story-Caroline-Knapp/dp/1480564060). Even though her upbringing was different than mine and she describes a lot of gender-specific circumstances and consequences it's like she was telling my story. She does a great job of articulating all the manipulations all the justifications sneaking drinks and hidden bottles how for years I deferred sobriety for perfect set of circumstances that I knew would never come. It's a really great day to be sober.
Alcohol Lied to Me Beck..Blackout Girl Storm..Breaking Addiction Dodes..Drinking A Love Story Knapp..Finding Ultra Roll..Understanding the High Functioning Alcoholic Benton........
Dry by Augusten Burroughs....He is able to bring humor to something that has utterly wrecked most of us. It made me feel a little less alone :)
[The Book of Drugs](http://www.amazon.com/The-Book-Drugs-A-Memoir/dp/0306818779/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390520103&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+book+of+drugs+mike+doughty) by Mike Doughty. ..He was the creator and singer/songwriter of the band Soul Coughing. The book is a chronicle of that band's rise and fall and his solo career as well as his battle with alcohol and other drugs and eventual recovery. Good read.
