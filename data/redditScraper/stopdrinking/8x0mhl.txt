I have given up alcohol several times in my life for various periods of time. The longest was a little over a year. I have always relapsed. It feels hopeless. Like I will never be able to maintain any semblance of control over my life...I know that when I have alcohol in my life I am surrendering control. I know that when I choose to drink I am ultimately allowing external forces in which can and do have major influences on me. I've ruined relationships allowed myself to descend into depression and even ruined some work relationships...My main question is therefore - how does one break the spiral? How can one permanently and totally give up alcohol safe in the knowledge that it will never return?

For me it was recognizing that I had a mental addiction to alcohol that finally put me on the straight and narrow.  The key word being addiction.  I wasn't a weak person.  I didn't have an unfortunate habit.  I had an addiction.  ..Loss of control goes hand in hand with addiction.  It's part of what addiction is:  a compulsion to continue an activity which at one point was pleasurable but is now harmful and one in which we want to stop but encounter difficulty doing so.  ..Addiction isn't a dirty word.  Nowadays people can get addicted to video games ha.  Unlike video games however alcohol is a drug so it's a bit more involved.  ..SMART Recovery was what got me to break my addiction.  I bought the workbook on line and implemented the program on my own.  That's what worked for me.  There are other ways for sure.  ..&gt;Safe in the knowledge that it will never return...I am not sure this will ever be entirely possible.  People have relapsed after years of sobriety.  Remaining vigilant is probably the best defense.  Urges etc are long gone but I know that I can't ever have an alcoholic drink ever again.  I can't ever forget that.  
I have to start with 30 seconds and build up to minute seriously. Mostly I focus on breathing. I had quit for 10 years then my wife who never stopped handed me a beer one night I think it's been 7 years. On day 3 I think...The idea behind the 30 second method is to stay in the here and now as much as possible for me thoughts in terms of the future cause anxiety\fear. 
I got sober in AA...One thing I believe is that I can only arrest it one day at a time...
I can only do today. Worrying about the future overwhelms me...Having said that at first after I stopped drinking I didn't trust myself but as time goes on I feel more confident...Another observation is that I have realised that I much prefer certainty and control over uncertainty. The reality we all have to face is that life is full of change and uncertainty. Learning healthy ways to accept reality seems to me to be the only way forward. Simple but not easy.
&gt;How can one permanently and totally give up alcohol safe in the knowledge that it will never return?..First - I let go of wanting "certainty" which is pretty much reflected in the terms of your question - "permanently" "totally" "knowledge" and "never"...Here's a concept that I had to embrace acknowledge and accept **Fully**.  And it was an obstacle until I stopped letting it be an obstacle...I Wanted Certainty.  I wanted Guarantees.  I wanted Control...That was my mind lying to me...The  terms "Never" and "Forever" are only ambiguous words that actually have no meaning in reality.  I Cannot experience "never" and "forever".  I can't experience "tomorrow" which is a lot smaller and I'm willing to bet that you can't either...I have today.  I don't control alcohol.  I demonstrated that over and over...I **Do** control my sobriety.  **That** is what I control.  ..If I do that today that is my limit.  All I am allotted is now....  today...    That is what I control.  ..Here's the "magic" in all that.  If I take care of today.  If I do not have just ONE little drink today....   the first one....    "never" and "forever" and "permanently" and "totally" have no bearing on my life...Instead of solving the huge unsolvable I resolve the small solvable now.  Instead of a HUGE undertaking it's a small thing...Easy Peasey.
Take it one day at a time. That's what's worked for me.
In order to quit successfully for good I had to 100% embrace the fact that **moderation is a mirage**...it is unattainable no matter how hard I tried or what methods I used. Besides what was the point? I drank to get *drunk*. Zero drinks is so much easier. Alcoholism runs in my family. It is in my DNA. Just like a person with a peanut allergy that cannot touch peanuts I must avoid alcohol at all costs.    .The only way I can control alcohol is simply not drink it.    .In early sobriety trying to imagine a future without alcohol was a daunting task. Instead I just focused on one day at a time. As time passed my mind and body started to acclimate. I started feeling better and better. My brain chemistry started to recover and I started feeling *happy.* Soon living an alcohol-free life began to feel perfectly normal. Now I feel better than ever and do not miss drinking poison whatsoever. There is no way I would want to go back to that miserable way of life. It IS possible. If I can do it so can you.
Great question. I'm in the same boat.
I think that is exactly the problem. You have to understand that we seeking sobriety don't have control over alcohol so abstaining is key. I know for myself it is so so true. One and I'm done. Until the next time I get sick and done with the whole mess. I think it will always be there we just need to reject it always...Its having a plan in place when the ugly monster shows up.  
I do it one day at a time. ..Good luck to you.
