When I was serious about it the first time before relapsing I told my SO about it. I felt bad but the conversation had an understanding tone. I requested a daily affirmation completely innocuous that could be said at a party. "I love you more than the world" or something that has a hidden meaning that only you two know...I hope something like this can work out for you.
