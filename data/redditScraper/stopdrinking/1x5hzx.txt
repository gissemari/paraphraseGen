Almost four months later I'm still sober. I haven't written in a while because I haven't struggled as much or felt as committed. ..I'm still having drinking dreams. They're always the same. I "forget" that I quit drinking and after I've drank I realize what I've done realize I'll have to reset my badge get disappointed and start rationalizing why I can "let this one slide". ..It's been the same basic premise for months. I always wake up feeling relieved but I think this badge is really what keeps me motivated. I don't know if it's a long term solution though. ...A few things I struggle with:..Boredom. A random sunday nothing to do. I used to be able to drink and it either seemed more interesting to me or was at least a way out of thinking for a while. ...Sex. Alcohol increased my libido and made me more aggressive and open. Now I don't really care and it seems some what like a chore sometimes even though I am attracted to my boyfriend I just don't get in the mood as easily. This is the one that concerns me the most because while I don't have the alcohol induced outbursts that destroy my relationship this one feels like a slow painful death to relationships. Like how can I make him happy if I'm never in the mood anymore? ...I still sometimes get the thoughts. Maybe one day I'll be able to do this responsibly. I know I can't. I know I'm a binge drinker. And that that will never change. But I hope to keep temptation at bay.

**Good job on the 4 months!**  I've had dreams like that and they were really upsetting to me.  Question: whenever you drank to avoid boredom is that *all* you did?
Check out /r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY . Another woman had concerns about the bedroom too this week. ..Congrats on almost four months. That's awesome. 
4 months is awesome. Sober life needs filling with activity and projects to bring that sense of pleasure that alcohol stimulates/simulates artificially. Now is the time to cast about for the things that interest you. If it's not sex right now than it's not. Every long term relationship goes through a lot of sexual adjustment. Good luck.
Thanks for posting and making me think. Congratulations on your several months of sobriety...It's no wonder the AA programme dedicates an entire section to questions of sex. For me it is a source of anxiety motivation shame worry joy everything mixed in a big confusing bundle of conflicting emotions. I've had more than one relapse related to unmanageable feelings about sex. I try to accept that when I'm not in the mood I'm not in the mood -- no matter how disappointed my partner will be. Conversely I have to accept that when she's not in the mood she's not in the mood. It will give me some unpleasant feelings (of disappointment of rejection) but those are my feelings and I cannot hold her responsible for them...The best way I've found of looking at it is this: sexulity is a gift. I didn't choose to be born a member of the human species; I just kind of popped into existence with the gift of two legs two arms warm blood a (limited) capacity to understand the world around me and a wonderful frightening world-shattering desire to be physically close to somebody else. This desire is full of traps and paradoxes but I wouldn't want to be without it. I should be grateful for it not complain on days when it doesn't work. I don't know if this makes sense to you but it has helped me...Take care and be kind to yourself.
Congrats on four months-- Awesome!! ..I am totally with you on the sex thing and applaud you for speaking up! For me I know that my husband and I had problems in that area even before I quit drinking. We are the very "adventurous" types but it's always without exception been alcohol-fueled. Right now I'm just trying to get to a place of him being willing to work with me on getting back in the habit of once-a-week "normal Tuesday-night sex" but he is not particularly interested in anything that doesn't involved hours of planning props and trick monkeys...I look forward to reading any replies to this thread and please share any resources you come across in your recovery!
