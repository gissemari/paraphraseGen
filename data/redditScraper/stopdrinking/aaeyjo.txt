But I didn't even notice! Last 2 weeks I've been working out super hard so I didn't even notice until I checked my app today. I just wanted to take little time to reflect on getting to 60 days...I think the most important thing for me has been to find a routine and I can't stress that enough for anyone struggling to stay on track. It has been an adjustment but aside from working out I've been getting myself to bed earlier been filling my day with activities rather than lounging at home and been staying away from people that set off my triggers. I've been out a few times with friends but haven't had the strong urge to drink except for a few times but it never seems worth it. So for today IWNDWY and I hope you all have a great Friday!
