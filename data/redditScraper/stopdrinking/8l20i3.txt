Background - I'm 51F who has been heavily drinking for 5 years. Over those years I have successfully tapered twice using this method http://hams.cc/taper/ but each time only made it 21 days before relapsing. ..Currently   I've been tapering for 8 days. I've reduced daily drinks from 11 to 3; however I can't seem to get from 3 to zero...I'll take any suggestions or advice. Thanks so much..

Me again ;). Hope you found that comment helpful...I don't know much about tapering (I couldn't do it I actually went to detox in a hospital) but have you spoken with a doctor?..I'm 46 tried to stop drinking for many many years. Finally stopped after detox at 44 best move I ever made. ..It's not easy but it is simple ;)...If there's anything we can do to help please let us know - that's what we're here for my dear! &lt;3
I did some tapering before I quit too but I didn't go by numbers. I started with rules on when I could/couldn't drink. I can't say this will work for everyone but it certainly helped me.  .One of my first rules was no more drinking alone. I was allowed to drink at anytime during the week no limit on how much i just had to be with someone who was also drinking. This cut out more than half of my drinking and drank much less during the weeks. It takes out the "hiding and drinking to deal with things" brand of drinking.  .After a few weeks of doing that my next rule was no drinking from monday-friday. So now i could only drink on saturday and sunday if i was with people who were also drinking. Now the problem with this is that my binges got much much worse. This was both a good and a bad thing because the hangovers became brutal and I noticed much more how on mondays and tuesdays it was so hard for me to not pick up a bottle.  .Those two things helped me get past the denial part of it and later in the week i would feel much better because I'd be dry and had a weekend of drinking to look forward to. The more I noticed that cycle the stupider I thought it was. Following the rules also helped me with the discipline part of it. And eventually after a pretty spectacular binge drink I decided that enough was enough and quit.  ..Note: I have no idea if this method would help you or not. I just wanted to point out that theres more than one way of going about tapering
