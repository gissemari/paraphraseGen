Well tonight is hard really hard. Eating candy and drinking soda helps a little I guess! Reading your stories inspires me.

Keep going! It will be worth it when you wake up tomorrow :)

You've got this! I will not drink with you tonight! 
Yeah you got this.  You go.  You are strong.
IWNDWYT and tonight! keep strong
I have been sober for five years now and something that really helped me out in the beginning was taking a supplement called L glutamine. It is a tasteless powder that will curb your alcohol cravings you can mix it into your favorite drink. Research it on google. You can get a bottle of it at gnc for around twenty bucks. Another thing that really helped me out was using an app called clean time counter basically you type in the last time you drank and it will count the days hour's seconds ect that you have been sober and you can add motivational quotes..It helps you to stay sober because you don't want to have to reset the counter at zero for drinking when you see all the hours you have been sober.  I wish you the best my friend 
Also eating candy.  Also IWNDWY.  
Fighting that struggle tonight as well...The cravings haven't been too bad in the past few days but they are eating at me now....I will not drink with you tonight!
