I had posted here about 16 days ago a few days into struggling after my 30 day break of no drinking. To recap quickly - the 30 days sober went great and I felt great. What did not feel great was when I went back to drinking. Long story short I ended up feeling very dependent on alcohol more than ever when I went back to alcohol. *Much* worse than ever before. I came here for support and it has been one of my tools to keep sober. I got medical attention for my anxiety and put together 2 weeks worth of 24 hours at a time by going to AA meetings and keeping myself busy. I just wanted to publicly appreciate this whole group since I have been looking at it just about every day and it has gotten me to a place where I am now halfway through another month sober with no plans to go back to drinking. I will not drink with you today and I hope you all take it easy on yourselves today. Thanks.

The massive  accomplishment of reaching  the peak of Everest is kids play up against not taking a drink when the craving hits.
That is awesome - thanks for giving me hope today. 
Awesome job!!
