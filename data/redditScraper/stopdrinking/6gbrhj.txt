Hi everyone!..I just wanted to say I discovered this subreddit two days ago and really admire everything that everyone tries to do here. That being said this is my first ever reddit post and I'm glad that I chose here. ..Years I've struggled with alcohol and always told myself I could control it. Turns out that I can't and today was the final straw for me. I woke up in a daze couldn't find my keys and overall just had a shitty day at work. I've been sober before but after a breakup I moved in to a one bedroom and started hitting alcohol hard again. ..After wanting to stop for awhile now and with the things that transpired today I just wanted to say that today will be day one for me. I'll continue to read posts here for inspiration as I start this journey of sobriety. ..So all in all thanks everyone for what you do here and it feels good to say that I won't drink with you today. Thanks again!

Welcome.  I found this board to be incredibly helpful.  Do you have a plan to get sober?  I started off reading the Saturday and Sunday stories in the sidebar and also This Naked Mind is an eye opening book available link in sidebar to free download.  I won't drink with you today.
