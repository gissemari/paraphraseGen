Pardon the grammatical errors..Why is the end so enticing? The moment is all we ever remember.  When beauty occurs we don't think about what has or will be; just what "is."  To be lost is where I want to be found.  My ego nags and gnaws at me to worry.  To be discontent.  Not motivated not inspired; complacent.  I have been a slave to myself for far too long.  Trapped in a hell only I could create for myself.  Rage resentment self loathing; hatred of all the beauty that I was not willing or able to see.  Drowned in drink or numbed with pills powders and herb.  I was numb to beauty.  Which can only be found in the eye of the beholder as they say.  .Sometimes in the moment I am lost in a dark place.  With all the self hatred I could muster came a need to preserve everything negative; it was all I had.  Like a broken down and beaten animal all I had was my rage and a death wish.  But still a primal uncontrollable necessity to survive.  My misery and hell was and is created by yours truly.  This leads me to believe that on occasion out of instinct our common ground is the hell we have resided in.  For in the fire we found a sick kind of faith.  Each time we woke up was bitter sweet.  "Too weird to live but too rare to die."  We thought living hard meant dying free.  The day of our demise and departure was welcome but uncertain.  .Therein lies our turmoil and struggle.  Willing to die; ready to die; no matter the method or cost.  But now we've found within ourselves and in the reality we have had or eyes opened to there is so much and too much to live for.  "It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything.". Peace and love as always. Thank you for my life SD...
