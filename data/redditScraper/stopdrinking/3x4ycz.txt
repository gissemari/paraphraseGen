So I posted earlier about being a big baby about something at work. It wasn't alcohol related but I needed to make amends for it. So I did. I took full ownership of this situation said what my part was in it (all of it) what I should have done and what I will be doing differently in the future. It was very well received...u/coolcrosby has me chewing on the idea that I have other amends to make to my work. I missed a lot of work back in my drinking days. It was irresponsible and especially reckless in the line of work that I do. I do need to make these amends but I am NOT ready to make them yet. I say that not as an excuse but because the very thought of making these amends makes me want to relapse. And that is not typical thinking for me...Also I'm going to find a sponsor. I had a sponsor who moved away and to be honest I really like her and I wonder if there is a way for us to continue to be sponsor sponsee through phone calls and text. Or at least have her as a secondary sponsor...I think I do need to make these demands but I'm not ready yet. Damn these insightful people on this subreddit.

What will tell you that you're ready?
Ugh I *know*.  I have been made aware of what I have not yet done that I could do to help me move forward.  And I shall just slower than some parts of me want.
It sounds like you've decided you need to take action. Sometimes when I do the same I need to take action sooner rather than later or it occupies mind space and that's a dangerous road. Ya know?
