Been on a 3 day bender and finally without any hope.. reached out to Reddit seeing similar stories inspired me. Not in a good place and willing to take any advice.

Welcome! This place saved me...I started coming here every day. I took it one day at a time.  I found my way out of the darkness into the light...You can do this and I'm rooting for you my friend. 
You picked a good place to start. I'm a couple of weeks in and reading the posts and receiving support from people who actually understand what I'm going through has been a HUGE help. Take it day by day you can do this. 
Keep coming back here and read our stories/posts.
I'm glad you reached out! Checking in here every day is a key part of my sobriety a journey I began by having an honest conversation with my doctor. 
AA helped me even just listening for the first few months. When I was ready to seriously get sober thats where I found a huge irl support community. Just an idea! I won't drink w you today!
You don't have to live like that. You deserve a better life
This little light of mine im gonna let it shine!.Ask and it shall be given!  You are never alone here we all have your back.  So many times i asked for the courage to try.  And here i am over 50 days.  Just one day is all you need. One...Peace!
