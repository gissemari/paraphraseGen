Tonight will be my 12th evening in a row without alcohol.  No wine - 100% sober for all of 2019 so far.  All of the attempts successes (57 day longest streak many other smaller wins) repeated failures and relapses 54+% sober evenings etc. set me up for 2019 to be the year that I might be able to  break through' to real lasting sobriety.  I am committed to this goal and I am trying not to stare at the  rock in the road' every evening when I drive home past all the stores I used to  rotate' for buying wine. This sub reddit and all of you who post and comment here have helped me more than I can explain.  I found the sub early in my 2018 journey that began with a dry january attempt (made it 15 days that time) and it has made such a difference - I can't thank you enough.  IWNDWYT

Just know this. You dont have to drink ever again.
I'll join you.  I've tried life drunk and it didnt work.  I'm ready for a sober 2019.  IWNDWYT.
