I have been on and off for about 2 months now. Longest I've gone is 24 days. I keep going back and I think it definitely has to do with being social. I love my friends and especially love my SO (who drinks on occasion) but doesn't enjoy it nearly as much as I do. She is really supportive and has quit with me on numerous occasions. ..After that 24 day stretch I wasn't sure how I felt about drinking all I knew is that I had to quit. My health is what concerns me the most I've been a type 1 diabetic for 18 years now. Quiting is of the upmost importance but I seem to always fall back into it. ..How do I stop myself when being social?

Hi Nero I noticed if I get a non alcoholic drink in my hands before anyone can ask about it that helps. Also if you frequent a certain bar/club make nice with the bartender and let them know you're a sober seeker and they will help you out usually.  ..Please take care a family friend died from alcohol two weeks ago and she was a type 1. Youngin too not even 40 yet.   ..Keep coming back and make a plan. If your gf is supportive maybe let her know you can't handle the group drinking thing for a while and find some other activities to do?

Well it seems as though you have identified the common denominator in your relapses. This is a good thing!..I avoided any and all gatherings where drinking would be happening. Now with some sober time under my belt I can attend functions with a little self confidence.
