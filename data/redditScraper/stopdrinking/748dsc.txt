I am grateful for so many things in sobriety but the chance to share my message of hope with other struggling alcoholics is definitely the most rewarding! I just wish I wasn't so nervous...Today is 6 months sober for me and it has been a whirlwind. In the past 24 hours I've been asked to share my experience strength and hope at a rehab and was also offered 2 jobs. ..For anyone out there struggling today it is possible to live an amazing sober life. One day at a time. I need all of your thoughts and prayers friends because my stomach is in KNOTS! I won't drink with you all today and I hope you have a great day friends!

i was told before speaking for the first time that it was good to be nervous.  it meant i was about to be honest. before i speak i say a little prayer before to help just one alcoholic. if you tell the truth you'll be fine. 
You'll do great!  It's so important to share your experience.  
I just said a small prayer for you. You'll be great!
Outstanding!
