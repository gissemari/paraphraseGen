This is inspirational!  I'm so happy for you right now!
Good for you for reaching out. Good luck on the next step of your journey.
Instead of doing the same and expecting a different result you did something different. Well done. ..&gt;I am trying *not* to do something. Why can't I succeed at this? ..I have a theory of sobriety that's worked for me. For me sobriety is *not* about trying *not* to do something. It's a positive--I *am* living as a sober person. Getting to do that required me to stop drinking. Then after working through stuff for more than a year I started feeling like I was sober. ..Sober to me means I'm not doing without anything that I want or need because I don't feel I need alcohol. I also don't--I dunno--swim for exercise and I don't miss it because I like running. ..Glad you're taking steps. Hang in there.
I am using the trick that worked to quit smoking which was to tell myself "Oh I don't do that anymore".  I know it sounds stupid but it worked for smoking.  I am only at Day 21 for SD and so far so good.  Best to you for reaching out for help.   
&gt;For me sobriety is not about trying not to do something. It's a positive--I am living as a sober person. Getting to do that required me to stop drinking...Good stuff. This has been my approach as well. It's very empowering.
Great job! I also worked with an addiction specialist psychiatrist.  I've also had many relapses but in the last five years I have been sober far more than I've been drunk and I try to focus on that when I get down about my relapses.  I'm so glad you're here!
For me telling my doctor was my first step in my journey. Now I've been on this road a short time but it's nice to know I have someone to go to if I need additional resources. ..I am proud of you.
