Well last week I realized I was relapsing. I forgot that as alcoholics we are never cured. Just one drink can take us back to the firs step. I thought it's been so long and I have already have drinks and I control myself pretty well. That not realizing I was already craving drinks everyday of the week. It's incredible how you can go back and not even realize it...I am just sooo glad I was able to notice in time...I constantly read the posts by other people and I feel so happy when I see how everyone is so supportive...I am glad I got here.
