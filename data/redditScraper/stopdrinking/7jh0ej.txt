[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy Hump Day! What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** I have discovered that if you stand on one end of my couch get on tiptoe and then crane your neck you can just see a sliver of the waters of the San Francisco Bay. So I have decided this means that my apartment has a bay view...**Struggle:** I may have to have surgery on my left foot which would have me recuperating for six to eight weeks. So naturally I have been worried about how to manage that: How will I get groceries while I am healing? (I live on a steep hill.)  What if the surgery goes wrong? (My doctor said the surgery has a high risk of failure.) Then I decided that instead of worrying I needed to listen to [the wisdom of Linus van Pelt](https://i.imgur.com/BFNLKuF.jpg)...**General:** I recently had the following conversation with my mother:..**Her:** Why have you chosen not to go back to drinking?..**Me:** Well for one thing it's expensive. Also it's fattening...**Her:** But drinking is fun!..**Me:** Well so is cocaine...**Her:** (Opens her mouth to say something but then closes it again.)..
----------immediate responses--------

Hey....Triumph.. lost few kgs and went shopping!!! .Straggle...was angry and sad cause i relapsed but today i feel great again.. more determined to dont drink this weekend...
Love that conversation with your mum u/sfgirlmary. I couldn't come up with an answer to that either! We must be neighbours although I'd need to be on the roof and have half a school knocked down...Triumph: First real desire to get a drink (actually I did not want to drink I wanted to relieve a panic attack). Woosh and on day 150 too! I didn't drink...Struggle: Anxiety. I think it's the medication. Feels horrible...General: Been wanting to get the construction workers some cookies. Yet I feel a bit shy about it.
Triumph: two weeks sober is certainly a triumph! Waking up feeling fresh and alert no more hangover dread and shame. I've started writing more and can only hope that this routine becomes the ritual that drinking used to be...Struggle: anxiety can be a bit tough and it's difficult to get to sleep sometimes. But it's only been two weeks. Also the nicotine addiction is hard to overcome. ..I love the quote about cocaine also being fun. Whenever I mention to my friends that alcohol too is a self-destroying drug they don't seem to get it. And they're all "against drugs". I guess it's all about what your parents and grandparents did - sometimes tradition can cloud your logic. I'm not sure about in the US but here in the UK getting drunk is celebrated. It's a shame that poisoning oneself into confusion and memory loss is what we're supposed to look forward to especially over the Christmas period. 
Triumph: Tomorrow I will take a final exam and turn in a writing portfolio to finish up the credits needed for my Associates degree. It's kind of a trip. I've relapsed since a few times but in June of 2015 I was sober and randomly enrolled in school. I was a high school dropout that didn't get his GED until 25. 29 now. I'm very proud of myself for this...Struggle: I'm so fucking tired. I slept 4 hrs last night between studying before bed and in the morning all damn morning. Also started and finished a writing assignment then took a final. Studied tonight again and tomorrow have to wake up early study put together a writing portfolio take a final then go to work lol...General: I'm losing weight and I'm already on the skinny side. As soon as I'm done with tomorrow I'm gonna try to put on some healthy weight. I'm so excited for some time off school. Like FUCK...Hope everyone has a good day. Thanks for letting me vent lol.
I really wanted to drink tonight. I have a 30-40 min bus ride from the gym back home and after a decent climbing session I really wanted to reward myself with a small bottle that I could bring on the bus. That bus ride is rough at 11 pm at night. Worse yet is that if I have a good climbing day I use booze as a reward and if I have a bad climbing day I use booze as a relief. Either way I want some booze. ..Anyway anytime I passed a bar or liquor store I just focused on my breathing and just tried to be present and aware of any irrational cravings. ..I made it home drink-free. 
Haha!  This is an all around funny Wednesday edition sfmary.  Nicely done.  ..**Triumph:** So many triumphs this week.  I'm loving it. *First* I found out I passed exam 2 out 6.  1/3 of the way to full fledged architect.  *Second* I killed it with both my boys' birthdays in the past couple of weeks.  I think they really enjoyed the activities we did and loved their gifts.  *Third* big Christmas bonus for me from work.  WooHoo!  Paid for exam 3 and will have $ left over for Christmas for the family. *Fourth* finding some inclination to pluck at the guitar and dabble with my paints again.  Yay!..**Struggle:** I just cannot get myself to fall asleep early.  I am a night owl forever I'm afraid.  I really enjoy having time in the evening to relax read study work on projects etc.  I am like a kid that just doesn't want to go to bed and miss out on the fun.  But I am *terrible* at waking up early.  Sigh.    ..**General:**I've been really missing smoking lately which is stupid as fuck.  I just do though.  I am NOT going to smoke.  I've worked too hard at quitting to give in.  Funny no one ever asks my why I quit smoking when I'll start again or what about special occasions? Lol. 
Resetting my badge for what seems like the 30th time here goes.
Triumph: At 161 days this is the longest I have been sober in over 15 years! I realized today I survived a string of events and stresses this past week that normally I would have soothed with 2 bottles of wine and a blackout almost automatically. I realized that when I feel like I have come close to collapsing I never gave myself a chance to get through it - just always assumed the worst and inevitably made it worse by drinking till I shut down my thinking. ..Struggle: My head is starting to feel clear ... and I am starting to get to know some of the things I was hiding from in the bottle. I am having a hard time with motivation mostly around a huge writing project and it's hard not to freeze in the wake of it's impending deadline. That all or nothing thinking creeps in and still overwhelms me. ..General: I have been musing on something my therapist threw out a while ago - "maybe alcohol isn't the problem but a solution for you"
I am not drinking today
**Triumph:** Pat on my back: To focus my slippery mind I make a list of the things I need to do. Only five items but every time I do one I erase it make a mark and enter a new item to the list. I need a list but they easily become too long and intimidating or the tasks are too big. Preparing firewood? Victory. Bying that battery? Victory. Sending those Christmas cards? Victory. I feel like an idiot for saying this but heck I m an idiot who got 17 things done in a week. That s almost like tackling life. - Pat on others backs: I m off salary and on social security now and I was *this* close to losing the equivalent of $3000 right before Christmas because I was too distraught to check off a box on a form. Luckily my boss and the salary division came to my rescue. They didn t have to to that but they did. ..**Struggle:** I m having real problems with my motivation. After a month I m finally physically home free but the idea lingers. I know it would be *so stupid* to give in still I find myself looking for excuses. Oh well...**General:** My inlaws are coming today. The kids (2 and 4) have a Christmas celebration in kindergarden and they are both performing. Before the small ones came I always *hated* utterly *hated* that crap because I have an older son living with his mom and children performing and stuff was always a dagger in the heart. Now I m more at peace with things and we have these two little ones and I guess I ll survive and even find it enjoyable :-) BTW my inlaws are awesome. At my wedding speech I said that meeting them felt like being the prodigal son returning and my father in law sighed profoundly and said  yes .
Early days for me but last night's **Triumph:** calling at the pizza shop last night then nipping to Sainsbury's whilst I waited for my order. For possibly the *first time ever* I didn't buy any alcohol to go with it. I then went home and ate my pizza accompanied by only blackcurrant flavoured fizzy water!..**Struggle:** Still haven't told anyone that I've stopped drinking and am a bit nervous about how that's all going to go with all the upcoming parties and get togethers...**General:** Anxiety is still generally above average but certainly lowering each day - Hoping to triumph over that shortly...Loving this sub - it's so good to see how many people are in have been in a similar situation - has made me feel a bit less alone!..
* **Triumph**:  I'm not drinking despite my struggle. I've indulged in some extensive snacking but have been sane about it and haven't gained weight. ..* **Struggle**: We have a newly estranged child and it is hard. It is hard to talk about because people just assume that 1 estranged child is an accident but more than 1 -- must be your fault. It's hard because this isn't what I set out my hopes in life for. I've turned to Seneca's *De Consolatione ad Marciam* (translated of course); a letter to his friend Marcia who grieves beyond help for her son who has passed away. ..* **General**: It is a blessing that over the past months I've setup and grown into several routines and habits. They help keep me on track. I also find a lot of joy real pleasure in little things I find. I like computer stuff a lot and have recently found some software that makes my geeky life a bit "simpler" in the way only a geek can say that without a hint of irony. It's real fun to use it and play around with it.
Start of day 9! 
Is this the check in thread? If so yeah won't be killing any brain cells tonight
Feeling great! Day 4 here we go! 
Oh my god this week is literally dragging. How can it only be Wednesday. My fianc 's holiday party is tonight and I was supposed to go but he bless him seemed to sense my   low energy / unwillingness to socialize because super casual while washing the dishes he goes "oh if you don't want to go a few people at work need an extra plus one..."   ..Thank. The dear lord. I immediately ducked out of the holiday party.
Triumph. Since stopping drinking I have bought a new(to me) car for the wife and family(well needed for safe winter driving in canada) started new training for a career change and am in the process of repairing two broken relationships that were broke because of drinking. Amazing what almost two weeks of being SOBER can do!
Love that convo with your mother! I may need to use the cocaine line. ..Triumph: I am handling mom's hospitalization and need for more support at home calmly and hopefully competently. Grateful for general alignment of goals and philosophy with her and among close family members. And wanting to drink has not been an issue--there's a little wistfulness when I see a glass of wine but I am hyper-aware of how grossly the negatives outweigh any momentary relief or pleasure. ..Struggle: While not drinking hasn't been hard I am still overeating. But I will take lessons from this community and just keep trying until it sticks. ..General: Having once had a best friend who was a doctor and seeing how the sausage is made I am not at all intimidated by members of the medical profession. 
Hi all my first real comment here. ..Triumph - i quit drinking this week! After making an ass of myself at the work holiday party Saturday night i woke up Sunday and said this is it. Guess i had to go out with a bang. Reading This Naked Mind right now and am really into it. ..Struggle - I've taken breaks a few times before and i know the hardest days are coming usually after a week or 2 and definitely on the weekends. Having a party Sunday and don't need friends shoving drinks at me. Plan to tell them all I'm sober and drink seltzer out of a party cup. ..IWNDWYT. Thank you all here for being inspirational to me. :)
Triumph: I admitted to myself that I needed support with this journey and went to my first AA meeting yesterday..Struggle: I'm having an existential crisis about being an "alcoholic" for the rest of my life. I just don't want to drink anymore but I don't want a label either..General: Just looking forward to spending my day with my little guy.  He's so sweet.
Triumph: I have spent at least 20 minutes a day (and usually 30+) on the treadmill every day for the past week and my blood pressure is down and I'm feeling much stronger...Struggle: Boyfriend has started drinking again. Just a little so far and is not trying to tempt me or rub it in my face. His drinking problem has never gotten nearly as bad as mine so I'm not worried about him. I want him to be happy. But last time I caved it started with him starting drinking again after 4 weeks and my addicted brain saying "well look at him-- he's fine I'll just have a few too". Have to avoid that line of thinking this time. Also getting the holiday blues pretty bad. Trying to shake it off and focus on positives. ..General: Started listening to Home podcast. Have my intake appointment for out patient chem dependency treatment scheduled for right after Xmas. Gathering resources. Not just going to fly by the seat of my pants this time.
**Triumph:** I'm officially salaried with benefits! My insurance kicks in on the 15th so I can afford glasses and meds I've gone without for too long! ..**Struggle:** I have a couple kids in the classes I coach who really struggle with failure/confidence and I'm honestly not sure how to get through to them. I was that kid and I know that with work and time it gets better but right now I'm at a loss. Anyone have experience in this area?..**General:** Hah! I wish I was clever enough to shut people down like that. I'm getting better but usually I trip over my own tongue and stay quiet for the better part of an hour.
T:  Finished my final yesterday.   Passed my class.  Recovering today. ..S:  I have to get health insurance for myself and my daughter because the company is no longer going to cover the state i live in. ..G:  Went out with my classmates after the exam.  Just being around them made me glad to not be drinking.   I'm sure they aren't feeling to well today. 
**Triumph:** Blew right past 30 days. Shattered all my previous attempts at abstinence. As a plant-based eater I found that when I shifted to a vegetarian diet I started looking with a much more skeptical and critical eye our society's obsession with meat and animal products. I felt a shift within myself and I knew that I might have a few slips but I would not return to these habits. I feel something similar with alcohol consumption. I'm now hyper-aware of how alcohol is marketed how much people talk about drinking the amount of drinking on TV and movies etc. Before talking about drinking and seeing it on the screen would make me want to drink (or make me feel that my drinking was just fine). Now it makes me immensely grateful that I finally how the power to peer behind the curtain and see how alcohol truly works to make you miserable...**Struggle:** I'm still *super* addicted to my phone and screens in general. The irony is that SD is one of the things that I credit for my success alcohol abstention but it also has fed my tech addiction. So while I fully acknowledge that staring at my phone is much less bad than sucking back a pint of vodka it's still something I wish I was free from. I guess I'll take my fences one at a time...**General:** Godless is a pretty good show.  ..
T:  With the year coming to a close I feel better about my life than I have in years. Over the last 7 months as I've begun my new life the weight of the old threatened to drag me under. The weight just seemed like too much to bear. Most of that is gone now. There is a plan to shed the rest of it. I see the light at the end of the tunnel. I look at the future with hope rather than dread. ...S:  I have really kept to myself these past months. I've felt it necessary to focus on bettering myself shutting out many external factors including many people. Some friendships will last. Others needed to go a long time ago. But last night I found myself itching to do something and I couldn't think of anything to do. I did not want to drink. But I couldn't think of anything to do in its place. Going to a bar did not sound fun and sounded like a bad idea on top of that. I guess I just wanted to socialize. I miss that stuff. I went to a restaurant just to be around people. It was empty. Lol. So I just went home and played video games. I was fine but I need to figure something out. I'm thinking about trying AA just for the social aspect alone. My recovery has been going well without it though and honestly I worry about fucking around with what has been working. 
**Triumph:** One of my sobriety mentors told me I've really got my shit together. One of the newer regulars at my meeting said he really like what I have to say and that I know my shit. I need to learn to take compliments better...**Struggle:** Just... #Fuck  .Fuck cancer. Fuck depression. Fuck stress. Fuck the tyrannical threes.  Fuck politics. Fuck climate change. Fuck rampant development. Just fuck fuck fuckitty fuck fuck fuck. There.
I will not drink today. 
OMG sfgirlmary love (!!!) the response to your mother.  .Triumph: I'm back on the horse again.  Was sober for 6 months relapsed off and on for the past month or so and now I'm on day 3 again!  On a positive note I will be sober over half of 2017 when all is said and done and that's a huge accomplishment!..Struggle: Same as every first couple of weeks.  I want to eat all the carbs all the time.  Craving sugar and pizza and sweets.  This too shall pass.  :-)..General: My Christmas shopping is almost done so that's cool.  I might actually be able to relax a bit this year.  
Triumph: Yesterday I finally made my own decision to quit drinking.  It feels surprisingly good (and nerve wrecking) to make that decision for myself.  ..Struggle: Last night when trying to fall asleep I was getting really anxious about failure.  What if I fail? What if I look weak to my husband and friends and family because I am admitting that this is a problem for me.  Also I am feeling a bit anxious today because it's my off day and I finally am sober to work on my LONG to-do list... Where to begin!?  ..General: I keep reminding myself about the pesky annoyance of "what ifs." (Remember the ol' Shel Silverstein poem?).  I need to remember that every little step is awesome! ..I love this sub and am so happy y'all are here!.
**Triumph:** I'm still in training for my new job but I think I'm going to like it although it still exhausts me. One good side effect of this is I've been sleeping quite deeply and nothing wakes me up during the night...**Struggle:** Due to the circumstances of my work situation I haven't been able to see my loving husband for over a week. I miss him a lot...**General:** I'm working for the same healthcare network where I used to work over 15 years ago. One of the head nurses from the floor in the hospital where I used to work stopped by to visit one of our residents. She remembered me and spoke very highly of me. It made me feel good. I know I can do this and do it well...Happy Wednesday SD! I will not drink with you today.
Triumph: I pulled myself out of my pity party and re-engaged with the world. I am 233 days sober. .Struggle: I may have to do that again tomorrow. And I need to get back into any kind of exercise routine to give myself more energy. .General: I like sober.  .
Triumph: Starting my 4th day of sobriety...Struggle: My favorite brewery is opened today.  Using self talk to not go...General: I made a date with my daughters tonight to avoid the brewery.  We are Christmas shopping!
**Triumph**:.I put down the bottle the morning of Wednesday December 6th and I've now finished my first week without a drink so that's good. I also found out I can marinade chicken in a zip lock bag with just some spices and olive oil which completely changed the way I cook my meals...On top of being sober for a week I've also been meditating for the past 18 days. Just 10 minutes a day but back when I had done it for 1-2 months just 10 minutes a day was enough...**Struggle**:.A few difficult moments one of them being "you can work from home tomorrow" situation where my brain went directly to "Sweet! That means you can drink tonight since you can sleep in late go and get yourself some booze".  I didn't though I talked myself out of it by telling myself that it's just going to do more damage and I'm going to be groggy all day if I do. And as I said earlier Wednesday marked the first week of no drinking so I didn't want to relapse so close to the first milestone...However as if that wasn't bad enough today I woke up from a very realistic dream where I got drunk with my usual poison of choice  and then in a hangover state (still dream) claimed to myself that it somehow didn't count. I suppose technically it didn't since it was a dream but still. Waking up from that it took me maybe 5-10 seconds to realize that I wasn't hungover and I hadn't drank the night before...**General**:.Well I finally figured out why I've been sleeping halfway through to my alarms lately. At some point at some night I had managed to greatly decrease the volume of the alarm clock on my phone meaning I wouldn't even hear it until maybe 5-10 minutes later after the volume gets louder...It's also 11 days until Christmas and I can't wait to get myself a Christmas tree never had one at my own place before! Now that I haven't turned my paycheck to liquid shame I've even been able to afford Christmas tree ornaments for the soon-to-be tree...Not a whole lot going on but it's a start.
Triumph - I've been on SD every day and spent some time working on myself over the last week. I'd gotten slack and lost my self - awareness over the last few months. ...Struggle - I've got a funeral to get to on Friday an interview on Monday prep all weekend and travel between working the usual 9-5. I dunno why this is stressing me out so much but not drinking is making it a lot easier to cope. ...General - i just watched an episode of the Simpsons at 6pm in the UK for the first time in months a little ritual I enjoyed but it was one of the shit newer episodes - the jokes are so lame!!!!   
[removed]
Triumph - predictably it's the fact that today marks 4 weeks without alcohol..Struggle - feeling depressed and defeated lately.  I have health issues that I've ignored too long and there is permanent damage done.  All because my alcoholism kept me too scared to go to the Dr..General - I'm still feeling motivated to stay dry and I am dedicated to trying to remediate some of the damage I've done to my body.  I'm taking steps and really looking forward to the benefits however long it might take to see them.
I've quit at least 6 times this year. The first time for 60 days and the rest all less than a week. I'm back again and hoping this is  the one  as I'm feeling very motivated about fitness and racing (MTB and triathlon) again. ..I will not drink with you today. 
T: I made it through the day and took care of my responsibilities at work. Booked an appointment for a therapist tomorrow as well...S: I'm starting to accept that I am quite depressed. I am very good at hiding my emotions especially from myself but I no longer have the energy for that. Yet I am scared to confront them let alone feel them. I am scared to feel joy to not escape my fears to not fill my senses with stimuli to escape the emptiness. I feel that if I look down there it will swallow everything else. But I can't keep pretending that I'm fine anymore. ..G: I've started earing plant based breakfast smoothies and I feel I could live off them :) Not going full veg but eating less meat seems to make me feel less heavy both physically and mentally.
I'm not going to drink today.
Triumph: I told all my tight friends about my new path forward Monday and went on to tell them I may not be around for a while as I adjust to rewiring my thoughts. All were extremely supportive and encouraged my choice. Then I asked them if they could provide me with anyone they might know like a friend of a friend or coworker who is sober that I might be able to lean on here and there. One of my best friend's put me in touch with a best friend of his father in-law that is recovering as a problem drinker. My girlfriend's mom also hasn't drank in over 20 years and she is being very supportive encouraging and honest. ..Struggle: I'm having a super hard time rationalizing a vacation my girlfriend and I planned to an all-inclusive in April. I know the date is far away but it seems so close and scary to be surrounded with a never ending flow of alcohol. I'm also crying a lot thinking about things but I'm turning a corner this week and have been in much higher spirits. ..General: A couple things. ..Sunday I wanted 'reward' myself for putting a small amount of time under my belt. And I bought a nice little chain necklace with a circle pendant. One side is inscribed with the last time I drank a heart under that and iwndwyt under the heart. The other side reads 'one day at a time.' I wanted this to keep things visual for myself and constantly remind myself where I am coming from. ..My uncle a great guy who is also a youth pastor that I see maybe once every couple years randomly reached out to me Thursday. I lost it when I read his message. It's almost like he knew I was in pain. We talked extensively yesterday about battling demons and how some spirits are there to bring us down like the spirits served at a bar. And the positive spirits that can pick us up. ..I've also noticed the two sides to this sobriety thing. While most people are ultra encouraging and offer enormous support a couple people have toed the line advising I don't need this path and if my drinking were bad enough they'd say something. ..Well guess what? I don't really care for that. I'm tired of how I was blacking out and randomly pissing myself at times. That part of me is gone and I'm fully concentrated on moving forward. ..I will not drink with any of you today. 
Triumph: I wanted to drink last night and I didn't. I didn't drink today. ..Struggle: I've got the winter blahhhs. It dark and COLD even my apartment is freezing with the heat cranked. All I want to do is sleep. 
I'm was bit depressed and then I looked at my period app. Either I didn't add last months start or I'm pregnant. Fml. Bought a test and whatever the results I will not drink today! 
Haven't read the rules and I'm sorry if this breaks one. I've been trying to quit for half a year but haven't quite managed. At least now it's weeks between but I find myself coming back to drink when  reasonable  opportunity presents itself even though I  know I don't want to objectively speaking. Right now somewhat drunk. Bipolar means i have even more reason not to drink yet here I  am. ..Am on a fairly good path though if someone in Oslo wants to hook up (I do some mma related sports which has been a life saver and usually keeps my mind off other things if you want to join forces with me). But hello /r/stopdrinking. Guess we can consider this my day 0?
The current opportunity was a xmas party with work and i actually managed to start very reasonable.Whilst in the company of colleagues. Then they all went home and i decided to go to the pub by myself to have Jagger bombs and pints so i realise it's not straiggt forward with me. 
Feel like all I did today was sleep and eat. I feel gross and it's only day one. I can't sleep and I've got a headache 
Suuuup. Keep on keeping on
6 days sober
Triumph: I've switched my gym routine and am getting up early to go before work. I feel awesome and have more energy/focus through the day!..Struggle: My best friend has been staying with me this week. I'm over the moon happy to have her here but I've missed a lot of my regular meetings haven't been doing my readings and neglected my step work. I am starting to feel a bit shifty and will be glad when I can refocus...General: we just got a lot of snow where I live. Keeping my fingers crossed for a white Christmas 
Triumph: Day 2 of sobriety!.Struggle: I still want to drink :(.General: my black finger nail polish is all chipped and I need to paint my nails.
