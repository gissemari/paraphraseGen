While on this business trip a funny thing happened; instead of influencing colleagues to drink a lot as happened in the past when I openly share my struggle and recovery they tell me they are influenced and inspired to make changes in their lives too. Quite a reversal.

That's awesome. You are a strong person now influencing people in a better direction!
Thank you for sharing that!  I believe there are so many people like that in the lives of each and every person here on SD.  I hear a lot of what will people at work/my friends/the *bartender* **think** of me for turning down drinks?!  Some of them will think your a hero.  Even if they keep that a secret.  Because you are offering them a chance to make stand for their own choice now.  This is such a wonderful post.  Thank you      iwndwyt!
