Vent Open:..(So this isn't *exactly* appropriate here yet it does relate to the struggle. Life can be frustrating!)..I'm trying to teach myself programming and running into a lot of frustration. The learning curve almost seems to be a wall at times and it's not just me. I read a blog this morning from an actual programmer who was complaining about how user unfriendly getting into the field can be. ..Even the supposedly beginner resources are overwhelming. I couldn't have this conversation on r/learnprogramming -- you're expected to phrase questions a certain way and all of the questions on page 1 are over my head. I don't sense there are many true beginners at my level frequenting that board. ..When I have asked questions in other forums a common response is "have you Googled it" or "you'll just have to learn by doing." Coming from a background in education this is terrible pedagogy. I would never tell a student learning English as a second language that they should just Google something. (I have googled the things by the way.)..Right now I'm still just working inside the development environment and solving basic math and word problems. A real program that an ordinary user could click on and use feels a million light years away. It's just about everything I can do to keep going at this point. But I guess I will just out of spite. ..Vent Closed...All that said: I'm having a bad morning. ..I just have to remind myself of this: When I was drinking learning programming was only *idea* sloshing around in my brain. Today I am actually trying to *do* it no matter how frustrating it is at times.

Have you tried learning a scripting language to dip your toes in first?
Someone said: "Pain is weakness leaving your body". Frustration when trying to learn something new as in this case is weakness leaving the part of the body situated between the ears. I hear you. But you ARE doing it. And that is how languages are learned little step by gruelling little step. You can do it!
