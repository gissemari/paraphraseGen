This was shared a couple of days ago and I thought it sounded like a good meditation/prompt for Weekend Writing...&gt; We must each discover our own truth. It does not help us if those we love find their truth. They cannot give it to us. It does not help if someone we love knows a particular truth in our life. We must discover our truth for ourselves. We must each discover and stand in our own light. ..&gt; We often need to struggle fail and be confused and frustrated. That's how we break through our struggle; that's how we learn what is true and right for ourselves. We can share information with others. Others can tell us what may predictably happen if we pursue a particular course. But it will not mean anything until we integrate the message and it becomes our truth our discovery our knowledge. ..&gt; There is no easy way to break through and find our truth. But we can and will if we want to. We may want to make it easier. We may nervously run to friends asking them to give us their truth or make our discovery easier. They cannot. Light will shed itself in its own time. Each of us has our own share of truth waiting to reveal itself to us. Each of us has our own share of the light waiting for us to stand in it to claim it as ours. Each experience each frustration each situation has its own truth waiting to be revealed. ..**For your consideration:** What did this make you think/feel? Tell us about a time you discovered your truth about something.  How did that happen? What was revealed? Where did it lead you?

I found my truth two weeks ago at my first ever AA meeting. ..The subject of discussion was self-pity and I realized that I was and sometimes still am awfully good at pitying myself. Feeling bad for myself was my easy way out. It meant I didn't have to consider changing myself or working harder because I already had it harder than most other people. But that's bullshit. Plenty of people have hard lives and many of those people have fantastic lives regardless of their hardships...Most of us are going thru hard parts of life and that's why we're here. Don't let that stop you from being strong and becoming the baddest mofo that you can.
My truth is that i am someone who sometimes wanders off the beaten path and takes the road less traveled by. I have found this makes all the difference (with a nod to Robert Frost).  My truth is that i have realized that most people live in sick cultures that the human race needs to continue to evolve. My truth is that my personality is fear based.  My early life was a lot of fear trauma and terror.  I have found a way to be happy and whole despite this.  Fear no longer dominates my existence. It pops up when it should to warn me of danger. Fear is now my ally.
I have a teenage daughter. Many times I have told her things that I have learnt so she won't repeat my mistakes and... she doesn't listen. Doesn't care. Won't be told...I was / am the same. Sorry mum.
Emily Dickinson wrote ..&gt; The sailor cannot see the North.&gt; But knows the Needle can...I came in to sobriety again almost 11 months ago totally broken very afraid and most of all confused. Having tried everything to help me quit drinking I just stopped trying to do it my own way. I listened to the staff at the treatment center. I listened to my doctor my counselor and my sponsor. I used other people that had a measure of happiness and serenity in their lives as a Needle and today I have a little bit of that on my own. I still cannot see my North but I know I'm heading the right direction today.
&gt;We each must discover our own truth..Fear or Love?..I can interact with the world from a position of  fear  in which the preservation the protection of  self  is the primary objective.  .I can interact with the world from the standpoint of  Self .  ..My epiphanic truth was when I discovered that I was interacting with the world from the standpoint of  self .  .. Every discovery does not change the world but very discovery changes the discoverer. ..That  discovery  indeed changed the discoverer .that being  me .  ..I learned through trial error struggle and pain that  Preservation of Self  was my main goal.  I learned that Goals need plans.  My operating plan was directed by  General Fear .  Fear of anything that might adversely affect  self .  Fear established a redoubt to insulate and protect  Self .  There were walls with battlements the better to look into the distance to notice any potential adverse people places or things.  Fear established a forward operating base to intercept threats before they got too close.  Fear served as the  General  of my army and Fear pressed into service various conscripts to serve on the front lines.  These were the foot soldiers.  Some had names and ranks such as Private Impatience Corporal Irritation Sergeant Intolerance Lieutenant Apprehension and Captain Anxiety.  Serving just behind them and directing their deployment was Major Resentment.  The field officer was Colonel Anger...This was all pretty much running on  automatic .  I was operating from a fear-based vantage and not cognizant of it.  It was common to  be irritated  to  make others wrong  and if necessary to create resentments and finally to respond when  Others Made me Angry .  I of course at that time did not realize that no one can  make  me angry.  Rather it was and is a choice I make.  ..So my  truth  was discovering that  Fear  was the basic operating plan for my life.  I could not have told you that.  I would have denied that.  But that was **The Truth**.  My Truth...When I discovered that it only meant that I wanted to *Change my Entire Life* approach!..I did not and do not want  self  to be the central feature in my life because it employs  fear  as the operating plan.  Instead I wanted **Love** to be the primary characteristic of my existence.  That meant dethroning  self  and electing  Others  as a primary focus.  Instead of indulging self and living a self-centered existence I choose  others .  When I think of others when I do for others when I extend care compassion and kindness I live from my heart.  Fear is in my head.  Love is from my heart...All I had to do was change my whole life...I tore down the walls leveled the redoubt filled in the moats discharged the conscripts.  I'm now more open.  I'm vulnerable.  And since I'm not employing an army any longer my costs have decreased dramatically!  Those costs included isolation sadness loneliness depression and misery.  Focusing on self required all of those carrying costs.  ..Now I enjoy  lightness  indeed serenity.  Peace abides.  I walked away from the battles.  I laid down my sword and shield.  ..My new  truth  is I give love and often it returns in larger measure...It only required that I change my whole life..
When I was a kid I was told  truths  that were pretty horrific. As I realized they were misled at best I also realized I could not take anything anyone said for granted including my parents. After that I explored my own truth in everything...I do believe this is a wise enough approach but I'm concerned with the downsides. I have come off as proud or a real know-it-all sometimes rightfully other times not as I've honestly gone to lenghts to find the truth. But what's worse is the difficulties in learning from other people's  lectures  - the more convinced someone is combined with insufficient backing the less will they reach me. I believe in science I believe in experience but I do not believe in opinion and people eager to share their  wisdom  are often opinionated. So when real wisdom has been presented I'm afraid I haven't been able to take advantage of it. Slow learner.....
To answer my own prompt. Finding my truth...my life's journey. I love /u/trynamakea_change's quote of Emily Dickinson; that fits well for me. There's also the concept of "that still small voice." And I used to teach my students a somatically-based way of knowing their truth -- to feel an energetic expansion and *pull toward* something that (sometimes felt in the heart/diaphragm) which often means "yes" or a contraction/constriction in the diaphragm &amp; belly a sense of *moving away from* and a shortening of breath which often means "no."..When my SO had an affair and our 26-year relationship was turned upside down my son kept asking why I didn't just leave and get a divorce.  I kept telling him "I don't feel 'yes' yet." While this also sent me sprawling face first into my drinking it also sent me back to therapy.  Two years later I got sober again. A year after that my truth was getting clearer but I wasn't ready to make the full leap (30 years is a fucking long time to be together; it's all I'd known for my adult life).  I asked for a separation. Six months later coming home from a meditation retreat *I knew.* /we were divorced less than a month later...My spirituality was another area where I've had a journey to find my truth.  Raised in a Protestant home where church was a big part of our family I started questioning Christianity when I was in high school.  Over the next 10 years I realized that I really didn't believe in an omniscient beingness of god. At the same time there is a ton I don't know about the world the universe my own mind and body.  So while I don't believe in god per se I believe in [the Mystery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP9LT5HuzrE).  My truth -- that I keep striving to live into -- is that I have a nature that's natural state is love and compassion for myself and others and that this should be the basis of all my actions.
At meeting last night the topic of discussion was humility. I think a lot of my truth comes from realizing I've often made myself the victim and given up my own power. I let other people dictate my emotions... whether it's because they're paying too much attention or not enough attention or don't agree with me etc. 
It made me think of Carl Jung.  He was never into psychedelic drugs and I've had a hard time understanding why.  I am in no way advocating for the use of psychedelic drugs or any drug for that matter!  But I think that they can be a useful tool in many areas. ..I think I have a slight view as to why he wasn't interested in psychedelics.  I spend time with my daughter doing her homework and it's so damned frustrating for me because I can't do her homework I can help her but if I just tell her the answers I'm not really helping her...I was able to rationalize my alcohol use.  At sometime I realized that I wasn't different.  That was a very difficult moment to stomach.  I'd became that person that punched out of work went to the liquor store and cracked a beer as soon as he got home from work.  There were negative consequences accumulating from my drinking and I kept going with the drinking.  ..It led me to the thought "being an alcoholic sucks!"  I felt like a damned genius when I figured that out!  It was like I had discovered some scientific breakthrough that would revolutionize humanity...Then I realized that I wasn't the first person to come up with this conclusion.  What I had to do was to go through the misery and pain to come up with that conclusion on my own.  People can be pretty damned stubborn sometimes.
I remember I started to understand my truth about six months into my sobriety. I kept thinking I was this broken mess of a person that would never be "normal".  But after as each day went on I slowly started to learn more about myself and what this program had to offer me.  Through the start of this journey people kept trying to fee me I did not have a problem because I didn't fit the stereotypical alcoholic. Part of this bummed me out because they would never really understand how I was feeling. I would open up the best I could talk about my problems and listen to their advice. ..I found comfort in my truth that even though I am a bit self centered and tend to stick to myself it is OK. I don't need to change myself at my core to become a better person. Each day is a new chance to learn and adapt to the world around me.  I don't have to bend over backwards because something makes me uneasy. I can now excuse myself from situations and not feel bad about it.  This was the greatest thing that has ever happened to me. Each and every day I say the serenity prayer because it gave me the ability to know what I can and cannot change.  ..I really hope that everyone in this program finds that truth that helps set them free. I don't expect everyday to be amazing. But I do expect myself to deal with the bad days a little bit better. Then I can enjoy the good days the way they should be enjoyed.  Thank you for this topic have a good weekend everyone.
Great prompt. ..I don't yet know my truth but I am learning. For a couple of years I travelled aimlessly causing myself a lot of grief because I'd not yet retired certain problematic structures/patterns of being that I'd inherited. I kept repeating the same traumas; I was stuck in a loop. I'd not yet learned to take responsibility for my life for my freedom. I was too afraid to search for my truth because I was afraid of change. I did not know how to examine my foundations...I have since learned how. I am very fortunate to be in a position where I am able to examine my foundations to resituate myself in my history. I am taking stock excavating. I am presently living in my childhood home sleeping in my childhood bedroom surrounded by (my dysfunctional) family. I've been here now for nearly 9 months. It has been incredibly eye-opening to spot the patterns and beliefs that I've adopted ones that have caused great harm to me and to others. Ones that I have used to limit myself. I have been able to situate my trauma to remember a lot of things that I'd tried to forget. I even revisited the Catholic church I grew up in and after great deliberation decided to retire the faith...I do not know when but someday I will leave here and I suspect that when I do knowing my truth will become easier. For now I am working on having compassion for my family for forgiving them for forgiving myself. I am learning to let myself love. I am working on releasing my fears. ..I am letting go of these structures one by one to find out who it is that I am. 
This was particularly interesting because I was just discussing a similar situation with a gentleman who has much more recovery than I have and he has done it through the program of alcoholics anonymous. ..Since I am not in the program \(AA\) he greatly encouraged me to find my own path and that AA wasn't for everyone... he encouraged me to keep doing what I am doing because it's keeping me sober day by day. ..I realized long ago that I was going to have to navigate these waters as sole captain and that the paths that have been laid out aren't necessarily the paths that I should take. ..I guess the truth is we all see the world through our own subjective lens and each one of us has a slightly different perspectives on what "recovery" should look like/ is. ..This has lead me to try and carve out my own path through the wilderness of life with little tidbits gathered along the way from various applications applied and refined once the program was into my software and carefully choosing which parts of the program I want hardwired into my own harddrive. After figuring those out its just a simple task of forming those pathways that I wanted ingrained by repetition.... even if there was pain sweat and tears involved. ..Another truth is my programming was flawed from the start. I actually had to reboot my"self". All of these things that I thought I "was" and people telling me what I "am" were actually extremely malleable. Aspects of me that I thought were ingrained turned out to be just software that was I was running. Once I was aware enough and learned that this was just a certain neuro\-biochemical pathway I was following I was able to shift the direction a little bit. This has lead to a monumental shift in awareness biochemical make up \(due to recovery\) and overall sense of well being. Just learning that I can change when I am willing was a huge shift in how perceive this life...This is no nominal feat and imo one of the greatest accomplishments anyone can do in Human existence is break away from chemical slavery...Sending love and good vibes from Kentucky.

i am too tired to find my truth. i want some hennesy to warm me into a comfortable drunken bliss..i know that isn't an option so all i can do is keep pushing until this feeling passes.
This is absolutely powerful. I felt really validated about my own experiences in reading this. Because what was shared is absolutely my truth...I am impatient which I think led to me using alcohol to deal with anxiety making anxiety worse in the long run of course. I don't like suffering the unknown the uncomfortable I want a quick fix. But the more I am present with the discomfort the more I learn about myself...I learned the most about myself the very first all night panic attack I had when I stopped drinking. I suffered. Every part of me wanted to go to the liquor store. But I suffered the panic attack until the liquor store closed and the panic that remained but at least I knew there was no easy out. I had to experience the anxiety. It was absolutely excruciating. And yet I learned as a result of this that I can absolutely get through anything. ..Thank you for this.
So this might seem kinda obvious for this sub but I think I'm finally starting to truly accept that I'm an alcoholic and can not and will not ever be able to drink in a healthy or safe way. I knew I had absuive drinking habits but it always seemed like a passing problem or something I could solve/control eventually. But as I'm going to meetings and reflecting on my past actions patterns and failures I think I'm finally coming to accept my truth... That I have a real problem and one that I truly cannot control. ..Again this may seem obvious to many people here but it is a very hard truth for me and one that I've fought for years and haven't been able to accept. ..I'm sure there are many other truths about how or why I am the way I am and cannot control my drinking and I look forward to thinking about that and getting to know myself even better. But this first truth is so important because it feels more and more like it is opening up so many possibilities for self knowledge and self improvement on levels I've never let myself explore because I've never accepted that first fact... My drinking is unmanageable and it never will be. I am an alcoholic and I always will be. I hate the finality of that but again if I'm being truly honest with myself I really don't see any alternative to that conclusion...Anyway great topic thanks for sharing it

I found a truth for myself in my grandkids. Ever since I was old enough to think about such things I knew I didn't want kids. I was never the little girl to rock her baby dolls and play mommy. And my barbies rode My Little Ponies into battle against my brother's G.I Joe's. As I got older I firmly knew I wasn't going to have kids the idea of getting pregnant was about the worst thing I could think that could happen to me...People would say things like "you'll change your mind when you get older". Or the slightly less offensive "you would feel differently about your own" as I sneered at someone else's sticky handed drooly monster. I almost saw having kids as a weakness like people's lives are so unfulfilling that they have a baby to fill that hole. This from a person who filled all the holes with alcohol but I didn't see that then...And then my grandkids happened. It's a long story as to how I came to have grandkids every weekend but the short of it is they are my step daughter's and she's no longer with us. I loved them in a base kind of way from the start it's hard not to love a baby in your care even for a 'kid-hater' like me. The truth however has become clear to me. I get it now. I love them like nothing else in this world. It's  a different kind of love a new kind of love that I never knew could be experienced. A love that I never thought I was capable of giving and makes me a better person in every way. I have no regrets about not having kids of my own but now I know the thing that no one could have possibly explained to me. Expressing and nurturing my love for them is a part of my truth now and I'm so grateful to be able to share my life with them.
This is a great piece of writing. I actually have a great example of how this is happening in my life right now. ..I am rereading Infinite Jest I book that I fell in love with 3 years ago but haven't picked up since until yesterday. It is a massive fictional novel that portrays addiction of all kinds and I believe that addiction is its central theme. It is both encyclopedic and hilariously entertaining. On my second read through I am noticing a few things that I hadn't on the first time around. I have a new appreciation for the drum tight sentences for starters. But I also realize that I was not ready to read it seriously before. I didn't consider myself addicted to alcohol at that point. I was a heavy binge drinker before a year ago but then it progressed to drinking nearly every day. I was a full blown alcoholic and I knew it. Unbeknownst to me I was experiencing what I needed to truly understand Infinite Jest. Am I happy that I had those experiences? I'm not sure. I was a mess for a year but I think I emerged a much better person who has cut out alcohol entirely from my life. The way that David Foster Wallace describes addiction is so clear to me know when before it seemed like an obfuscated scenario. I think that a lot of you here would have a very rewarding experience reading this book. I don't want to spoil anything in this thread but I'm thinking about posting some relevant excerpts in the future so you can get a feel for what I'm talking about. Can't recommend it enough especially to all of you. And as always IWNDWYT
