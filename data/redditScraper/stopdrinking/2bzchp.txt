21/m with 659 days sober ..Got cash back in university for commerce real friendships and pride in my achievements...Strong in reflection (Can't lie to myself) empathy and problem solving..Struggle with women (commitment really) associating with people that don't drink chronically (It was my life for years) and putting in effort into things. (I'm kind of a minimalist work intelligently to get the job done as quick and easy as possible)...My biggest problems with drinking at this stage are meeting new people cutting off toxic relationships and keeping my resolve to not use or drink. I know for a fact I don't just want one but sometimes I think fuck it I could get away with going back for a couple months before it all falls apart again.

As far as romantic relationships go at 21 days if you aren't in a relationship or marriage put that stressor in a lock box that is fire proof and give the only key to it someone who lives 3000 miles away along with the instructions not to give it to you until it has been an appropriate length of time and you are confident in your recovery routine.....otherwise not fair to her and complicates things for your recovery. You have enough challenges for now.
I saw 21/male which I interpreted as 21 year old male with 21 days sober....?
