I managed to drop it for 100+ days November to March earlier this year up until my mom passed. Two months later a best friend passed as well. Since then I've been off and on but known what I needed to do. ..I've managed to quit everything. From casual pot smoking to accepting any random drugs that are offered to me even cigarettes (smoked a pack a day since 2011) and energy drinks. I feel incredible and what's strange is that this time around I didn't struggle with it. Any of it. At all. No weird urges and having to talk myself out of going to the store. I did experience some hardcore night sweats and heightened anxiety the first few nights but that's it...IWNDWYT

Congrats!! This sounds awesome for you. I just commented to share that in my experience when I start to feel overly confident is when I know I need to pay careful attention to not slipping. Pride comes before the fall and al that.
