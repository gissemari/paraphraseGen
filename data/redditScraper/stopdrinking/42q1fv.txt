Hello all. Last Friday I completed a 67-day stay in an addiction treatment centre after 22-years of steady heavy drinking. In September things came to a head and my wife staged a mini-intervention. After that we decided to have a Sober October where neither of us would drink. I also started attending an AA meeting. We made it through October just fine but once November came around I relapsed fast and hard. Within 10 days my wife had left to stay with her parents. A week after that I was in rehab...Rehab helped me learn a lot more about myself than merely attending those meetings did. Opening up and reconnecting with friends has proven to me the support I have in my life. I got out of there on Friday and today I had an examination required for work to assess my fitness to return. That was where I found out about this sub...Anyway here I am 72 days sober home with my wife and feeling better and more optimistic than ever. And looking forward to adding /r/stopdrinking to my network of support.

Hi Skaloop!
Hey there skaloop. I hope you have a good day tomorrow. I'm not as far along as you but working towards it. Keep at it.
Welcome aboard!
Welcome! I've had r/stopdrinking as my every-present pocket support it's easy to dip in read and be in like-minded company. It's helped me keep pointed in the right direction and helped me rewire my thoughts on alcohol.
