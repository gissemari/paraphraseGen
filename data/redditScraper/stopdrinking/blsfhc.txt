It's been a week since I posted my first post about how badly I had screwed up because of alcohol. Thankyou so so much to everyone who commented I know it sounds stupid but honestly being told "one day at a time" helped me so much. I'd never really thought of it like that. ..I just wanted to share something that has really helped me this time around. About 3 weeks ago I started practicing yoga and since I committed to stop drinking again it has helped me so much. Often I struggle to leave my house because of my anxiety and especially without my alcohol crutch so getting to the gym for exercise is not an option. I've been using YouTube videos to help me. I've found "yoga with Adrien" to be the most amazing thing! She is so patient and kind and it honestly makes me want to be kind to myself. I'm not sure if this is allowed but I hope it is because its helped me be kinder to myself and is giving me a different outlook on my sober journey. ..Thankyou for all your kind words and I hope this can help someone the way its helped me.
