Sorry my friend. Sometimes a relapse is part of the recovery process. You know what it feels like to be tempted and give in. It happens. Get back on to your sobriety. ..Remember time heals most things. 
Help me you 100.000 bastards :(
Sorry you're struggling. As outlined in the community guidelines we ask that you only post when sober. For this reason we had to remove your post.
I mean you are in a honest path of recovery. But noone gives a shit! They're all pre-loaded about you.. And they HATE you...Square one. We drink because we hate to be hated :(
It's all the same in terms of getting clean. Relapsing is relapsing. Don't let the idea of 86 days lost get to you. There are people that have relapsed after years (like I did with smoking). What matters is getting over it and learning from the relapse. ..This is a real disease and we can't forget that. 
My friend. I'm sorry but it sounds like you're not thinking straight. Can you get to an AA meeting?
I am just calling my sponsor now. Thanks :(
Is it possible to recover after a relapse???
