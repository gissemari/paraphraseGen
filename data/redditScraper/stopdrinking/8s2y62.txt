33 days is the longest I have been since I was 17 years old.  Not that the last 22 years have been pure misery but the downward spiral was steepening over the last 2 years or so.  I don't know when it changed for me.  Shaky hands on mondays drinking earlier and earlier calling out of work here and there and the anxiety just became unbearable.  I was losing my humor and optimism and replacing it with anger and depression.  Hid it well but the clock was ticking.  ..I have had a few resets this year but feel good this time around.  My first strectch of a few weeks in February was runined by attempts at moderation for "special events".  I still had it in my head that I wanted to drink but was just not allowed to.  Felt alot of the benefits early on (sleep mood poop improvements) but it wasn't enough.  On my last relapse I had to finally pay the piper with my wife and face the truth about my lying sneaking and overall shitty behavior.  This Naked Mind lots of podcasts talking with my wife cotinued presence here are all helping this time and I am mindful about lettling my guard down and spend time each day either reflecting talking or reading about my struggle with alchohol.  ..I have also been dealing with my identity as a drinker.  I have always viewed people that didn't drink or do drugs as lame or dorky.  The willingness to get fucked up was a badge of honor and embedded in my identity as a man.  I am now learning to let this go.  Clearer head and an aceptance of what being a responsible adult actually is.  I aim to hit 90 days just before my 40th birthday...looking forward to the second half of this life.  IWNDWYT!

I am on day 1. I also had the milestone of 40 this year (there really is something about this birthday being a "take stock of life" one). I would rather tackle this now and not wait until say 60. Good luck! 
I am relate to a lot of what you say here; optimism replaced by negativity a steep slope down in the past few years thinking moderation would work for certain occasions thinking that those who don't drink are sad. But I think it's great that you're on your journey now and are seeing the benefits of a longer time not drinking. That first month was really hard for me and I'm so grateful for this sub for helping me stay on course. Good luck on your journey :)
