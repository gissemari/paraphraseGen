Last night I was really tested. My MIL had some friends over and everybody was drinking one of my old faves (sauv blanc). It's the first time in 5 months of recovery that I've been so tempted. This is how I got out of the crazy thinking:..I am finally happy in my life and it's all due to not drinking alcohol. When I was drinking I hated my life loathed myself. I don't want to go back; I want to stay happy and healthy. ..Bam. Desire lifted. ..In case this is helpful to anyone struggling during the holidays. Love to you and IWNDWYT

I'm sober but really unhappy in my life so I somehow feel it wouldn't be that much worse (it would though... fucking sick brain)
Good on you. Stay strong. Keep on! 
Thank you for your post. I am hosting a party tonight and a little nervous about it. Your post helps.
Thank you I like my life sober too!!!  IWNDWYT
