Just a story. It is helping me to document some of my harder times and I plan to read them in the future when I feel in control again...The first time I got sober I white-knuckled it for months before the cravings went away. One night in particular comes to mind. My wife and her friends got back from a concert smashed at 3 AM. I needed to take one of her friends home and on the way back to my place remembered they had a bottle of vodka under the passenger seat. I slammed the brakes put it in park and started searching the car like a mad man. Seriously. Out of the car walking to all sides digging through the trunk at 3 AM. ..No bottle. I got in and started driving to the liquor store. They were closed. ..I sat in the car and realized where I was what time it was and that I was totally a mess. This was 3 months sober. My sponsor who had 10 years relapsed a week later. I really lost faith that I could ever stop. It was such a massive blow. At the same time I still questioned whether I had a problem. Still not at rock bottom...I am happy to say that I have hit bottom with my drinking 6 years later. I am not happy it took 6 years. I am happy to be sober today. I am happy to know in the deepest parts of my self that I am a better person without alcohol. I sleep better I eat better I work better I love better. Thank you all very much for this community. Thank you for your support. I am sober today and will not drink with you.
