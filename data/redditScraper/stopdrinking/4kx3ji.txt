I've never been a big drinker until now. Stopped smoking pot 2 months ago. Tho it seems I have replaced that baddish habbit with one  much worse for me. Started off with a few scotches a night but the last four nights I've been on a bender. Entire 5ths of Dewar's a night  last night I pissed off my buddies by being an ass. Got to shamefully apologize today  missed work. I never know when to stop. I've always said I'm bad at drinking cuz I am. I never have the luxury of blacking out I just get stupid when I drink I remember every dumb moment. It's like I just don't have any fore site when drinking like a switch goes off that says blocks me from reasoning. So I'm going to quit. For good before it really becomes an issue. I won't struggle with the DTs cuz I'm not in that deep but I can feel my self headed down  it definitely runs in the family. Having to entertain myself with out anything is my biggest struggle. Guess I need to find a hobby now. I'm not going to have a big coming out I'm just going to stop my friends would tell me just to pace myself better and to slow down a bit but I don't drink like them I can't have one I always finish the bottle . IDK why I even touch the stuff. So I wanted to write it down somewhere wanted to say it if for no other reason than to get it off my chest : today I quit drinking. Thank you for your time. Day one almost down.

I know what you mean about replacing one addiction with another. I used to smoke weed 5-10 times a day but hardly ever drank. When I quit smoking weed it was miserable...couldn't eat or sleep for two weeks. I had to live on a liquid diet because anytime I ate I'd throw up. I ended up getting through all that but then still couldn't deal with my emotions so I turned to drinking to solve that problem. Now I'm finally fighting that too. We can do this together. I won't drink with you today.
