I'm worried about making it through this trip with out drinking. Bars are everywhere I'm just nervous I will do everything I can to avoid a relapse.

follow my rule don't drink in front of work colleagues-period..Always be professional-these aren't your friends they are colleagues/potential clients..Good luck and I will not drink with you today!
Great advice.... nothing worse than seeing your colleague smashed and it effecting how people view them from that moment on....it has cost many their employment.....
I try to keep options available when I travel.  Can I exercise at the hotel?  I do yoga so I check out studio schedules near where I am. Are there AA or Smart meetings nearby if I need one. Is there a movie theatre nearby?  Good luck you can do this.
