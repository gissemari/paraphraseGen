I hit level 40 yesterday! I've turned into a big lurker here (and have been super busy at work) I wanted to share some things though. .First the drinking... still sober. Makerspace had an big fundraiser and after they opened up a keg and I pattered off home to bed... well actually I watched horror movies and played metroid. Same thing. Work has been a huge stressor and people have made comments like "bet your going to have a stiff one tonight" to which I reply "I don't drink but the wife is definitely getting a stiff one tonight." There is a bottle of something in the fridge that looks liqueurish but I don't talk to it and it don't talk to me. May not even be a liqueur. I did get a large jug of beer for my birthday  (my cousin was a drinking buddy of mine she didn't know) but I'm giving it to the kid. ..My grandbaby does not know a drunk Opa. That is an awesome sentence to say. She knows a tired Opa an angry Opa a tickling Opa. But I am always sober for her. She ownes my heart. ..My journey hasn't been completely easy but getting easier every day. My wife has been on her own journey for a year now. She is fat. (Hell I'm fat too but stick with me) when we met she was "losing weight" and for 20 years I watched this woman get bigger and bigger. Always "getting ready to diet" and just as often "this is the biggest I've ever been" she joined weight watchers and has been doing really well with it. Yesterday I got a huge Birthday suprise.  She apologized. I was corn-fused at first but I realized what was happening she was healing. She was sorry I have ever known her big. Ever used her weight as a crutch an excuse a reason to not do something. I've seen similar healing from this community and have made my own apologies. So I was supportive and let her talk and just listened and verified her (not that I could get a word in edgewise anyway.) So that happened. ..So it's May 1st I am not hung over. I have some new toys (a chia zombie hand a STM32 and a bunch of star wars little golden books to enjoy with my grandbaby) perhaps after I mow the yard Ill work some more on my 8x8x8 LED Cube...For the fellow dinosaurs I'm still alive and sober. You all are an inspiration to me and the struggling. For the strugglers it may not feel like it at the time but it is so worth it. Fight to free yourself and keep yourself free. You are worth it. ..For the lurkers yea you. Reading this with a drink in your hand wondering for the third night in a row if you should quit as you drain the glass and wait for your SO to go to the bathroom so you can slip on the kitchen and pour another. You who woke up to a wet spot put a towel down and started thinking of excuses to wash the sheets tomorrow without the SO finding out... ..You you who carefully planned your drinking schedule so you could stay sufficiently drunk but not run out. Stop lurking making excuses driving yourself mad over this chemical. Free yourself we can do it your not alone...I will not drink today.

&gt;started thinking of excuses to wash the sheets tomorrow without the SO finding out.....OH this brought me back! ..I also used to hide booze in our laundry room. So much hiding so many excuses...Thanks for this! You sound like a great opa!
&gt;She was sorry I have ever known her big. Ever used her weight as a crutch an excuse a reason to not do something...I get it...replace weight and food with behavior and alcohol= the same shit.  Congrats on your journey and good on you for listening and modeling that there are new ways of dealing with our patterns. Have fun with your grand baby Opa.
