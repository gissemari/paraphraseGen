I know this is a tried and true topic for anyone who's been around here or AA for a while but when I have these dreams it helps to "come clean" to my group (huh I just realized a subreddit is my new homegroup nifty). ..Around 2-3 months sober the first time I'd have dreams where I drank a beer be super sad about tossing my chips (relapsing not vomiting fries) and relieved to wake up still sober. I haven't had one in a long time but of course 63 days puts me right on schedule :p..It was a really random and all-over-the-place dream in which I was at a friend's wedding with my boyfriend and his whole family kept assuming I was a lesbian. They said how nice it was that my dude and I could be each other's date and they wouldn't let it go no matter how many times I yelled "I'M NOT A LESBIAN!" I ended up getting drunk just because I know that drunk me can successfully pick up someone far more masculine and attractive. For the record I think lesbians are the shit and part of me wishes I was little more into other women but I'm tragically straight and my man is rather effeminate...I was of course relieved to wake up next to my favorite pansy both of us still sober but this is the first drinking dream I can EVER remember that was so in tune with my real life. I'm 26 so it seems like all of my dearest friends are getting married. I'm not jealous of the weddings but I'm always sad that if I do get married it won't be to the sort of person I hoped. I love him to death but the only chemistry we ever had was when I was completely shitfaced. It's a little scary to have a drinking dream in which I'm reacting to a very real-life trigger instead of the usual "it's my favorite beer fuck it I'll have one" scenario that I typically dream. I certainly have no desire whatsoever to get drunk but I DO find myself craving an adventure and momentary escape which is what usually does me in...I'm just chillin on reddit with my coffee now off to work in a few minutes and certainly not going to drink today but it helps to get it all out there :)..Everyone have a beautiful one-more-day today!

&gt; next to my favorite pansy..LOL!  Poor guy.  I hope you don't say shit like that **to** him...Glad to hear things are going well otherwise.  Happy 63 to you!.
Had a sponsor tell me once drinking dreams are just a reminder that I am alcoholic.  If you woke up happy to have not gotten drunk that's a good thing.
