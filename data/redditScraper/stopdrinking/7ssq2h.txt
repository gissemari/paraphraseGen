Struggled with all kinds of emotions today. Anger frustration and overwhelming anxiety. I wanted to drink SO badly but I didn't. I have been binge eating to cope with my feelings. I feel awful now. It's so hard balancing all of this. Staying sober family work eating right exercising. I'm overwhelmed.

Sorry to hear it. Are you able to go to bed for the night yet look forward to a new day tomorrow?
Call in sick-take a day.
I can so relate. Dealing with stress is absolutely foreign to me and causes me to be physically sick sometimes. Binge eating happens occasionally as well during moments of considerable discomfort. But it's ok.  Progress not perfection  is the mantra I repeat during moments when I'm down on myself for using some weird maladaptive coping mechanism. You didn't drink and some days that just has to be enough. 
Right there with you! Almost nine months clean and this is where it actually gets hard I'm starting to realize. Now that I'm sober @ have some time under my belt all of the emotions and self deprecating thoughts come up and remind me why I drank. ..But we have the golden ticket now! We now of the opportunity to deal with this shit in a healthy way instead of drowning ourselves in substance abuse. At least we are free today. ..I will not drink with you today..Xoxo
I hear ya! But I always think my life would be a lot worse if I was hungover trying to deal with all the bs! Hang in there!
You are awesome for reaching out     I hope you feel better today... when I'm overwhelmed I like see which areas I can let slide and just focus on the vitals for a while until I feel better.  It's ok to need a break : ) watch out for the ditch and take it easy friend!  I will not drink with you today because I've got better things to do.
