Long story short I don't talk to my biological family on my dads side anymore because they're toxic and didn't support my recovery. But I do talk to my mom's side a lot but they're pretty traditional and we've never had a close relationship...Since I've gotten sober though I've been spending more time over there and really getting to know them and enjoying the company. But I've been hesitant to share my struggles for a number of reasons...Today though I was there for a Saint Patrick's Day dinner and it just sort of flowed out of me in conversation and I told them the whole story. I'm still so worried now that they are judging me or wouldn't understand. But I know that's not true and they were so supportive and gave me space and the time to speak and they listened it was really nice. I obviously didn't reveal the whole story in terms of the deeper struggles but it was nice to tell them about my stint in rehab and all the good things that have been happening since getting out...I'm still kind of on an adrenaline high from it right now and struggling to get to sleep. I'm looking forward to wake me up tomorrow and having the knowledge settle in that there's more people in my life who support me and that will make the journey forward easier!
