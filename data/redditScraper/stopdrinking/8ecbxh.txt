I fell off the wagon yesterday over some hell of a bad juju situation. But I'm gonna hold my head high and I'm gonna wear my shame like a badge. I know I fucked up bit now I can move on with new knowledge. I made a mistake but it's a learning curve. So here is the story. ..Over the last few weeks a girl I work with has been flirting with me. I took her and my supervisor out for a blues jam at my local pub. Now I haven't had any issues staying sober until yesterday. One month and I threw it away. But that's ok I can start again. So me and this girl were hitting it off just fine. Then I find out she's been sleeping with my supervisor while she's been flirting with me and asking me out. Now my supervisor is married with kids. I was pissed right off at them when I found out. I dipped out of the pub toute fuckin suite. I was angry with my supervisor. I couldn't believe he cheated on his wife with this girl. And her for doing this knowing he was married. Right fuckin livid. I wouldn't talk to either of them the rest of the night. I got a six pack from the pub went home. I drank the whole six pack in my truck while sitting in my driveway. I went inside my house sat down and my mom's employee came over. Fast forward through some drinks with her we drunk-fucked  (I ate her ass too I don't normally do that kind of shit). I woke up naked and missing some memory. Now everyone's mad at me because I acted selfishly. I'm not going to use this as an excuse to drink. I'm going to use this anger and sadness to fix all this. I told my supervisor why I'm pissed at him and told the girl we work with she should find a new job and not be a deceitful cunt. After all this I realised why I quit drinking in the first place. I don't want to be like these people. I can't do this anymore. I want to settle myself down and build a family. I want to be sober real and honest to myself. This girl I slept with last night is great and I need to be sober for both of us. She's mad at me for being drunk and I want to fix it. Because she's worth it. I'm worth it too I just needed to have this relapse to realise what's important and learn my lesson. Never forget your mistakes. Learn from them and grow because you can define your life in any way you choose. I choose to do mine sober and with a clear conscience. Despite a heavy heart and sadness. Thank you all for being here with me. Thank you all and IWNDWYT. Stay gold everyone.

That was a rollercoaster of a read. But hey if you're gonna relapse make it memorable right? I'm glad you're back my man.
