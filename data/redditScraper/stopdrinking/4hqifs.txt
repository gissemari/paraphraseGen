Hey there SD.Title says it all. I am not sure what I am trying to accomplish with this post but I don't have a ton of people I can talk to about this sort of stuff so I figured a bunch of strangers on the internet is my next best option. ..Im pleased to announce that my 22 days sober have been the longest Ive gone in about 14(!) years. Im feeling good but not great. I imagine thats typical...Im also happy but mostly terrified to report that I think Im actually going to graduate college. Adulting sounds hard/scary. But Im glad Ill be tackling this new life with a clear mind...My biggest struggles and triggers seem to be my current job (restaurant/bar) and my family (most are heavy drinkers). Im hoping to find a new job in the next few months but Im not sure how to go about dealing with my family...Anyways thats all I got. My therapist is a rockstar. This sub is a collective of rockstars. Thanks for reading God speed and much love to you all.

Congratulations on your 22 days. And love back atcha.
I found that going from working in a bar to working in a competitive sales-type of position was an easy switch.  It was also the best thing I could do for my sobriety.
