I wrote is as a song-ish poem about relapsing and my on-going affair with depression. I'm not a big poster here much more of a lurker but something about stumbling upon this today made me want to post it here. Sober cheers to all....I fear the fall ..Because I know ..How far and deep it goes;....I've fell before ..And it took years ..To climb out of the hole;....Yet still I go ..Down the same road ..Hoping this time I won't fall;....Will I learn ..Or is this it ..The time when I can't crawl.

Well it looks like you found a ladder this time.  keep climbing.
This is really good. Thanks for sharing that. Sometimes I would write song-like poems as well. It can be pretty cathartic.
I like your poem and how it looks at sobriety in a fragile way. We're all on the precipice of falling into that chasm; relapse is scary. For me each relapse gets scarier because I know how much harder it is to climb back up the cliff and out of that hole each time. My body is weakened each time. My tenacity fades each time. And my love of the drink magnifies each time--in such a sickly way. Thank you for posting this. Keep writing--it does good for the soul.
