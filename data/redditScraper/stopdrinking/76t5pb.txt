Hi! It's been a while since I've posted on this sub. From New Year's until May I (25/F) struggled to string together any more than two dry days. Two dry hours usually seemed impossible. Even though drinking took me to an emotional hell (that I never have to visit again) I had no other coping skills in my toolbox...On Memorial Day I surrendered completely. I checked myself into a dual diagnosis facility 1000 miles away from home. I had the gift of desperation I had been beaten into a state of reasonableness. When I walked into treatment I felt hopeless and defeated. My plan was to do what they told me so that my "inevitable failure" would be on the clinical team and the AA fellowship rather than on myself. After 90 days I "graduated" from the program feeling like a new person. My old enthusiasm for life had been restored--a trait that hadn't seen daylight since I began using alcohol at the age of 12. Fear of people and of economic insecurity had left me. I no longer harbored bitterness towards God or my past.  ..Over this past weekend I was in a slump. I felt myself slipping into old patterns of isolation and self-pity. Then I remembered where I was 141 days ago... withdrawing covered in mud and filled with terror. Where I was seven months ago... laying in a hospital bed attached to a banana bag with a BAC of 0.497. Where I was nine months ago... drunkenly trying to tie a noose with bondage rope only to give up and decide that freezing to death in the Iowa winter would be easier (and allow me to keep drinking). Where I was a year ago... making sure I had enough shooters hidden in my car to get me through a 4 hour drive to St. Louis without withdrawing...My worst sober days are far more fulfilling than my best drunk days. Even though I still live with mental illness I can rest my faith in my Higher Power and in my fellowship to help me through...To anybody in their first hours or days keep coming back. 141 days ago I could not fathom a life with joy productivity self-esteem or true connection. 141 days ago I was certain that my mother would bury me before she had to kick me off of her insurance. ..Prayer sponsorship fellowship meditation yoga and gratitude have saved my life and have convinced me that my life is worth saving...Your life is worth saving too.  ...
