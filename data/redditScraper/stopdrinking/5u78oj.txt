Two months feels a bit weird. The pink cloud has lifted but overall things are still so much better. Things that still suck: I haven't been able to find a job and I struggle with feeling completely useless and inadequate. 2. still learning language here and feel stupid pretty much every time I open my mouth. 3. and the worst no pizza delivery where I am :(. Things that don't suck: my husband is awesome. 2. i found spray-can whip cream today (first time I see that here!) and put it in my coffee 3. my mom is coming to visit me in the summer!! When I'm having a hard time I look at my lists and realize that the sucky things would still be sucky if I was drinking and that list would be a lot longer and my my good list a lot shorter. So I'll just keep truckin' along. I'm super grateful for this community and thanks for letting me ramble on here :)

Had to go home sick from work yesterday. For nearly an hour I was bothered by guilt for going home because I was too hungover to work (yet again). Had to keep reminding myself that I have been sober for two months now and I have a virus. So happy I am sick and not still drinking.
