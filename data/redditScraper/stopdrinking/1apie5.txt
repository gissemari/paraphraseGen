I'm starting to feel the withdrawals last acute kicks in the head and body. Every day I feel a little better. I'm glad I wrote all of this down. Last time I relapsed I fas feeling on top of the world and felt that I could easily handle a couple of beers. I can now look back and got through the awfulness of withdrawal and remind myself. I might start writing in a journal though rather than /r/stopdrinking. Perhaps update every couple of days or so. Then taper it down :).Again thank you to everyone that has helped me through a truly terrifying week. You guys have great big hearts.

day six here and I don't think I would be here without SD. Congrats on a week. I have one more day to go. I think tomorrow is going to feel great.
Awesome that things are getting better.  Keep it up!
I found journaling very helpful as an outlet and to later remind myself of how I was feeling in the moment. I kept reading here and posting occasionally (as I do now) for the ongoing support ideas contribution and sense of common cause. That and other tools--as many as I can gather--are both helpful and empowering...Hang in there!
