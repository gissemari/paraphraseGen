I don't  know what is wrong with me. At least drinking has restored a sense of normalcy. I'll never be able to stay sober...I just know it. I was doing so well too.

I could not understand what the fuck was wrong with me. Then I learned about what addiction looks like in the brain. I read about how my brain had become wired to expect alcohol crave alcohol and get excited even about being around alcohol. I learned that I was battling a powerful brain condition that was rooted in psychological biological spiritual and social causes...Then I surrendered. Then I started to get better...What was working for you? 
I hope you will remember that we are always here should you decided to start again.  Good luck to you.
You could always pour that shot out and start again. You CAN do this. I wasted 20 years of my life telling myself I couldn't. I found that rehab therapy and AA was a winning combo for me. You are not alone. There is obviously a desire to start again because you just reached out that is powerful. Go find that daily check in and sign up for the next 24 hours friend. 
well you were sober for two weeks recently. i can't remember the last time i went two weeks. you can always start again.

You can choose to live again. 2 weeks is nothing to scoff at. While all of us might have another relapse floating around inside not all of us have a recovery in there too. So you messed up we're imperfect beings. You weren't messing up for 2 weeks. The wagon is coming back round. Grab our hand and haul it back on in. We're there for you.
