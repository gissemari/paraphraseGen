I posted before about how I had always struggled with alcohol abuse but it became out of control when I started drinking 4-6 beers a night on 1.5mg klonopin (which by the way before anyone gets on my as about it I am prescribed by a psychiatrist for panic disorder). Saw the lethal path I was going down and decided enough is enough...It's day 4 now. My mental clarity is getting significant better although kpin alone has fucked up my memory big time. I haven't really had any withdrawal symptoms at all and I'm sure the klonopin has helped with regard to that (my GP said that's how it would likely be). I feel SO much better already. I'm going through one of the most stressful times of my life but I haven't resorted to alcohol to numb the pain. Last night was the hardest I have borderline personality disorder and I was triggered horribly by something and wanted to run out and get drunk and smoke a pack of cigarettes but I didn't drink or smoke which is a huge accomplishment for me. I finally feel like I can do this and I'm on the right path. ..This subreddit is instrumental to my sobriety and really helps me be accountable for my actions so I wanted to say thank you as well.

If day 4 feels this good can you imagine what day 5 feels like? :) Keep up the good work!
Awesome well done on your progress. The benefits honestly stack up and up as the days go on! Are you quitting smoking too? I somehow managed to kick both at the same time - wondering how it's going for you.
