Two weeks sober and my brain is screaming for hijinks. ..I'm home alone for the next week as the S/O is out of town - a situation where I would normally drink my face off. I'm not worried about a relapse but I need the voice inside my head to stop trying to convince me to order and eat an entire pizza or my weight in chocolate/candy...SHUT UP BRAIN!..IWNDWYT &lt;3

Bwahaha!..Why do our stupid brains never demand healthy things like Kale eh.....IWNDWYT ..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Ha I indulged my brain's demands for awful amounts of pizza in the first few weeks. Anything to keep myself from drinking.
The last four months I've been eating Oreos so much I should buy stock in Nabisco...I also have been lurking at my ex's Facebook page to see she has a new girlfriend and already has introduced her to her family when we lived together and I never met them. ..Ultimately I'd rather eat than drink but eventually I need to get my eating under control. Ugh. So I'm with you. ..Solidarity. IWNDWYT 
This is hilarious and 100% my brain too.
