One reason I always struggled with quitting alcohol and weed was because to me they represented a window to magic. ..I used these drugs to access another plane a portal to a higher realm of existence...But for me these drugs became dead and boring. They no longer gave me that magic - only pain depression anxiety paranoia misery...I have come to realise that sobriety is my key to a higher plane of consciousness. By staying sober my mind is liberated and builds on the steps of the previous days to gradually climb higher...I don't meditate but have wanted to for years. I'm hoping that my sobriety will be a solid foundation for this..."Imaginary evil is romantic and varied; real evil is gloomy monotonous barren boring. Imaginary good is boring; real good is always new marvelous intoxicating." - Simone Weil..The above quote was kindly shared by /u/Ladywhatever here: http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1mi2an/a_relevant_quote_that_i_think_applies_to_drinking/..Sobriety is magic!

Kudos for putting together well over a year of one day at a time. Your post is uplifting and made me smile. 
I've never heard that quote before I love it! Thanks so much for sharing it 
What a beautiful post.
Hey great post.  I have been meditating for a long time and listening to guided meditation videos are a good way to get into meditating.  You can rely on the experience of the speaker...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jyy0ra2WcQQ..This is a relaxation one there are so many on youtube.  I listened to a 2 hour long one last week.
