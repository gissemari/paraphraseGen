Hey Guys..I don't count days but I just signed in and noticed I am now over 1000 days. 1000 days of saying "nope." If I can do it so can you. I failed so many times when I was starting out. I even made it almost a year and the cravings were so hardcore I relapsed....again. ..For me it took time lots of time and work on myself to get to this point. During this try at sobriety at the 6 month mark I noticed a change from "Oh god I want to drink" to "man I don't want to drink anymore how can I achieve that?" ..I still have (very light) cravings sometimes but they are very different and nowhere near as hard to fight off. Even last night I found myself thinking that I miss the few beers with friends nights. What I don't miss is the litres of vodka the handcuffs the shakes the nightmares the pissed off family etc.....If you are just starting out good luck! Check in here often its such a great resource and community.
