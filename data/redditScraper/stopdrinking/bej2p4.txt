Yet again I've woken up completely destroyed after telling myself i was done with alcohol. ..I think 3 or 4 times in the past week I've drank a full 700ml bottle of spirits....I drank 5 strong beers last night and a whole bottle of rum I just woke up now at 8am and I'm a complete mess.. but i was the same yesterday morning and managed to recover and do it all over again. ..I dont drink every day.. but I binge drink at least a few times a week and very often i go on an absolute spree like this week and get completely hammered 4 times...I have OCD quite badly and even though my  medication keeps it under control for the most part these days.. I still struggle with it and i think my heavier drinking is a habit I've picked up over the years from self medicating to ease my OCD symptoms...A few years back i used weed to medicate myself and developed a psychological dependency to it which had me spending  60 every day but eventually i had some kind of nervous breakdown which lead to me getting help with my OCD and quitting smoking it...I slowly started drinking more and more shortly after. ..I don't have any hobbies or interests apart from drinking my life is a dead end and I've achieved pretty much nothing by the age of 31 because i've basically spent my life blowing my brains out with drugs and alcohol...I keep saying I'm done with alcohol.. but my family and friends all drink pretty often too...But the difference is that when they stop and the "Party" is meant to be over.. I stay up and drink myself to sleep. ..I think the reason I'm struggling to quit is the fact I can't seem to imagine a life without alcohol in it?..One of my concerns is that none of my family or friends have a problem with drinking it's casual for them and they know when to stop.. it doesn't impact their lives like it does for me so i know it will seem strange to them when i say i've had to quit. ..And I think the other thing is that being completely sober will be a new experience for me I went from a 10 year weed and casual drinking habit to a 5 year not so casual drinking habit lol ..I'm not 100% sure what I'm trying to ask you guys right now.. ..I guess i'm just venting and looking for some kind of  advice from people who have been in a similar situation?

Hey I also have OCD (and generalized anxiety and panic disorder) so I can definitely relate to using alcohol to self-medicate. The thing you have to remember is though alcohol might seem to help in the moment it'll make your compulsions/anxiety more difficult to control the next day. There's little worse for OCD than a hangover. And alcohol messes with the effectiveness of medication...I used to be the same having no real hobbies or life besides drinking. Since I've stopped drinking I've been able to fill my life with meaningful things and I'm actually doing all the stuff I always wanted to do. I'm in art school I'm studying on Duolingo everyday I'm working out reading more writing a bit. I find myself with the energy to actually fill my life with my passions and hobbies. And it's way better for my mental illnesses to have those outlets than drinking ever could be. I'm on my longest stretch of sobriety yet (43 days) and for the first time I'm taking meditation seriously. I find that with each passing week I have more energy than the last to fill my life up with stuff that just makes me better...You're probably going to have ups and downs on your sobriety journey. I fell off the bandwagon several times myself. I'd have one week two week three week stretches of sobriety then cave and have a beer. But even with each relapse I realized the alcohol didn't work like it used to and the stretches got longer. As long as you're always working towards sobriety in whatever ways work for you you'll get closer and closer to a better life...And as for telling others that you can't drink while they can because it doesn't seem to ruin their lives the way it ruins yours you don't have to frame it like it's something to be ashamed of like you have a problem and can't be like them despite wanting to. For me I think it's a better mindset to say to others that you're not wanting to drink that you're making a choice for your health because it makes you happier.  I just feel better not drinking  is something I've said a lot when questioned. And it's absolutely true. ..Best of luck to you. This is a great community full of inspiring stories and good advice.
