all through uni ive struggled with my drinking being unable to stop myself before black out. You know the cycle drink too much then spend the next day hating urself for whatever bullshit has popped up. well now that im graduating I can barely remember what ive done and have very little photos. and then it hit me ive been going to events and trying different things this whole time but being so stuck in that loop I wasnt really making memories and truthfully made less connections than I would have if I didnt have this issue. I also didnt travel a lot and theres a bunch of shows I didnt get tickets for because I was a broke college student and was super cheap about spending money. And then I realized what money I did have was going towards weed and drinks which in the end didnt make me very happy rather than doing cool shit...&amp;#x200B;..Basically learn from me and ask yourself what memories you are creating and if they make you happy. Undergrad is the time to do more than just ur studies and figure out who you are. I took a lot of life from my time here for a couple more drinks and its just not fucking worth it.

Amen! The drinking culture of college made me think that I didn't have a problem. That being a drunken asshole was normal and okay. It's not.
