At best I'd be suffering with a cracking headache tired depressed overweight struggling to stay above water at work beaten down and overcome with shame and self-loathing.  That was every day for me actually that was probably a good day...Today I'm suffering with a cracking headache and I'm tired (the result of sinusitis rather than a hangover)...But I'm not ashamed I'm managing my weight I love my job and am good at it I'm aware of myself and I'm okay with the knowledge that I still have a lot of work to do - I want to keep going I'm worth the effort...Last week I called an old friend that I've kind of been avoiding.  He's an alcoholic and I just could t face talking to him when he's drunk...So I called in the late afternoon figuring he'd be likely to be more sober.  Nope he was very drunk and told me what sounded like a funny story but was actually very very sad. Part of the story involved him opening a bottle of wine at 11am on a Sunday when he had a houseguest that he should have been entertaining...It just left me feeling so sad. So sad for him helpless that there is nothing I can offer him sad for the poor girl who had her weekend visit ruined because she didn't know he had this issue and sad that he couldn't see the impact of his behaviour on her...And sad that this was me for so long.   Not exactly the same but I must have ruined dinners weekend trips etc by simply. It being present in any real way.  By being drunk or hungover by cancelling plans with little or no notice...It's awful to think about but also useful to remember.  And it's not as awful as it could be because it's not me now.  ..Now I make and keep plans I show up and I am starting to think more about other people instead of focusing on myself so much. I'm excited to be with other people and not because it justifies me getting drunk...And I now go to bed at a reasonable time instead of staying up late for no good reason...And that's what I should be doing right now so I shall say goodnight...Goodnight you wonderful bunch of sobernauts and thank you all for helping me get myself onto a path I want to be on...Stay safe everyone and be kind to yourselves you deserve kindness ..xxx
