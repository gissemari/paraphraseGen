I left AA for a couple of months and now I want to go back but I'm worried that its going to be super awkward with everyone in the rooms. I feel like everyone is going to be cold towards me and happy to see me still struggling. What should I expect going back in?

You should expect acceptance. Anyone who doesn't understand and is cold toward you has a few things to learn about life. All of us our vulnerable to struggle. You won't be the first in that situation anyway. Besides AA isn't something you leave and then have to  join again like a club. It's always there waiting for you when you're ready. Stand tall and walk in that room where you belong. 
I'm sure they will be happy to see you! 
I've been there and it will all be positive.
They will say welcome back.   This happens all the time...AA is not easy to get used to it can rub the wrong way especially in the beginning but even now I occasionally will switch meetings...If you have been drinking it also is not a big deal at the start of some of my meetings they ask "is anyone coming back here for the first time or visiting" you can raise your hand or not...Welcome back
I have only seen people be welcomed back with love! 
They will be delighted that you are back.  A few of them will have gone through exactly the same thing.  You have nothing to worry about.  My own pride tried to kill me many a time but most of my fears were in my head. Good Luck.
