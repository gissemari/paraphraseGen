This is the day I struggle with the most. I am craving HARD today. I just want to get off work go drink and smoke cigs. How do I stop this cycle? I want to. I WANT to feel free. I need to. I don't want to be an addict. Trying so hard not to give up again.

When I was having a particularly tough day I tried to do things that I enjoyed on the easier days. Lots of self care. Ice cream shitty movies on netflix reading posts here on SD all night hanging out in my sweatpants. Whatever it took to get past the crappy night and into bed sober. ..Do you have a few things that you can think of to do tonight instead of drinking and repeating the cycle?
I joke that 7 days makes one weak. (I'm a dad now so I get to do that)..The underlying meaning is that you feel that you've accomplished something and can go back to your regular lifestyle.
I'm on day 7 right now and all I can say is I'm glad I'm not the only one. Let's take this day on and not drink together. You're already posting about it and I feel like that means you're wanting to fight it. Don't give up. 
Is it that you quit when you're hungover so the 6 days intervening are easy because you're less likely to drink. The 7th day is Friday which is the traditional drinking day. So you just need to get through Friday and Saturday and you'll be golden...The same thing happens every weekend but a little bit less each time until its no longer a habit...For me anyway.
