I used to look at everyone's flair and get so jealous. I never imagined I'd see a smiley face next to mine. Getting sober was the hardest thing I ever had to do. I reset my badge quite a few times this sub was always here when I needed it. If this knuckle head could do it I believe those of you still struggling can also. I'll post something longer tomorrow when I have more time describing the pretty significant transformation over the past year but for now I just wanted to thank all of you. Love you /SD !..edit: I felt like a CHAMPION today and did a lot of little things to celebrate. Seeing all your posts throughout the day made it extra special. Going to go sleep now. Good night everyone and thanks again :)
