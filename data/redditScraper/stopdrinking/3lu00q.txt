It's been a few months since I last checked in here. When I used to come here several months ago I had been struggling to control my drinking because I believed it was preventing me from clearing a hurdle at work. Once that challenge was completed I let go of a lot. Things kind of started going my way and I went back to my old habits. I got comfortable. .I'm here again because I want to be. I don't want to stop drinking for work I want to do it for me. I want to do it for my girlfriend and for my family. It isn't fair the way I use my girlfriend as a crutch; when I stay at her place I don't drink when I stay at my place I wake up on the couch with a headache and empty bottles. .It isn't fair to myself-- my face is fuller and more bloated than it should be skin is blotchy and discolored and from a productivity standpoint I'm not being the employee I should be. So anyway I'm checking back in because I want to see who I can become. Talk however is cheap... but I won't drink today.
