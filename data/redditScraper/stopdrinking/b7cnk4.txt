I just wanted to say thank you for this sub. I had a strong craving yesterday and so I just scrolled through all the posts here until the beast went away. I am so grateful for all of you. It blew me away how there are hundreds probably thousands of us all struggling with the same thing. It gives me strength when mine falters...I'm in day five and I'm an emotional wreck today. Crying over everything. I never cried like this before and it surprises me that the crying actually feels good. So I will stay close to this sub and let the tears flow lol. And Iwndwyt

Very glad you're here with us!
Welcome.  We are so glad you are here...You are gong through the worst of it right now.  Hang in there and white knuckle it for a bit longer and I swear it will get easier and much better!  It isn't easy but it is sooo worth it...One thing that helped me down the road was reminding myself how much of a struggle those first few days/weeks of sobriety are.  It may suck right now but that just might serve of the inspiration you need to resist a surprise temptation when your badge hits triple digits...Congrats welcome we are proud of you! IWNDWYT
