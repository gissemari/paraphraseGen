I was tired depressed and I didn't really care about my sobriety today. I was looking on the internet to see if there was a good promo on whiskey close by and preparing myself for a relapse. I didn't do it though. Instead I ate a bucket full of Ben&amp;Jerry ice and bought some comfort food to ease the pain. It worked still sober!..

In the moment... Whatever works works. In my experience it's usually just getting through those 10 mins or making another choice like a piece of pizza from the gas station. Eating something immediately usually kills any desire I have to drink. 
Eating something sweet always works for me.
This internet stranger is proud of you. I have an app on my phone that keeps track of my days sober. It helps me through these times. 
Glad you got through it!
Ben and Jerry's is better than my sponsor who told me to chew gum when I have a craving. Ridiculous right?
Good to hear! 
Thank u all for the nice replies!
You kick butt. You kick it all around town. Go you! :)
