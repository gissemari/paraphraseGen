On monday I had to commit myself consciously to soberness for the first time of this journey. I went to the store and bought nothing to drink that day. While it's nice to be able to do so I have the feeling it's only a very small victory on my way...Of course I went to stores before without buying any liquor. I also managed to stay sober for a few days quite often in the last ten years. It's especially easy after a fuck-up as I had one last week. It's owed to the raised awareness of the problem. This awareness slowly fades away the consciousness of the failure of the past sneaks of into oblivion. Leading to the thought: "Oh it's been so long why don't I treat myself to some beer today? It would be nice.".At the first occurrence of this idea for me the battle is almost certainly lost. I can argue for hours with myself have the most rational reasons against drinking. I will end up in the liquor section of the next store and surrender to the craving for alcohol. "What harm will a six-pack of beer do? I will stop after that." - slightly doubting this myself at this moment but doing it anyway...The problem why I lost this fight all the time I think is: what seems to be a rational discussion is nothing more than the struggle with an urge. It's hard to beat something which is itself not rational with rationality. Of course I'm used to think a lot about the world and my own position in it in form of arguments. But in this case I deceive myself to see something as a discussion ruled by the strongest arguments what is in fact a monologue of myself going to the store to buy beer. .You can't really argue with an urge and win. It won't go away be giving it attention and thoughts. If it would vanish the reason to argue would be gone too. That's why I always end up with something to drink in my hand because I convince myself to have the better arguments against the urge while in fact I do exactly what it demands by going to the store. ..The right way to beat the urge would be to stay aware of it to make a conscious commitment against it. If it arises I should not start to argue with myself about it I should already have made a rock-solid decision about it and go over to the necessary actions to overcome this faulty impulse. ..That's why I decided to stay around here in r/stopdrinking. It helps me to stay aware of the problem learn from others and to commit myself to stay sober. I can share my own thoughts and stories probably someone will read them and probably even benefit but at least I can keep myself aware of my own problem continue to take it serious and try to change. I'm thankfull for this opportunity and for what you all are doing here. Thank you and have a nice day!

 &gt; The right way to beat the urge would be to stay aware of it to make a conscious commitment against it.

Don't negotiate. The agony is in the negotiation. The answer is already "no". If the answer is just "no" then you don't have to agonize over the discussion...There are already a number of things in your life that you don't negotiate. Will you step into oncoming traffic today? You already know the answer to that question. No. That's a terrible idea...Will you drink? You already know the answer. No discussion is necessary. Put it away and move onto something else.
i've found that sticking around and participating here is a good way to stay aware of my addiction. You might find something in [Mindfulness Based Relapse Prevention](http://www.mindfulrp.com/) or [Urge Surfing](http://www.mindfulness.org.au/urge-surfing-relapse-prevention/) that fits with the way you're thinking of urges as non-rational.
