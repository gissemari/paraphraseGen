I met her at a community drop in I volunteered at...We had lots of good talks...A very nice person but very troubled...Always getting in her own way...She was trying but after years of struggle I guess it became too much...God Bless.

I am sorry for your loss. It is hard to know how much people we meet are struggling.  I hope you are able to find peace and stay strong. :)
