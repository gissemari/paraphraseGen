Well I got through the night it was tough but I did it. The cravings are bad but I am doing my best to use my coping skills to get by. Feels like an uphill struggle.

Well done!!!! Keep going! And try to quickly block that booze goblin (inner voice)... go for a walk.. talk to someone.. eat sugary products... drink big glass of water... its hard but its getting better... iwndwyt
Awesome job :\). Around that day is when it started getting significantly easier for me. You've come a long ways and have a lot to be proud of keep it up \&lt;3
I'm not going to lie: the beginning is hard but it does get easier!
Also you have a ton of us here to lean on for support. On days when I'm feeling tempted or just down and out I come here for support and remind myself that this has all been worth it. Every drink and temptation resisted was a good choice :-)
Congrats!  Those early days are not ones I ever want to repeat.  You build strength in sobriety with every test of temptation.  Try to shift perspective a bit and look at the desire or urge from outside of yourself.  I found saying things like "I'm experiencing an urge but I don't have to act on it" to myself helped.  No why no reasoning no endless loop of trying to understand just "this is what I'm experiencing.  I choose not to act on it."
