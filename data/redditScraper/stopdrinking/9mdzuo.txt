Of my first day on the new job!..Sorry for the clickbait!..Sitting here 45 minutes early. I'm scared. I'm afraid I won't be good enough. I already have a list of things that *could* go wrong...  My recent life has been like 14 months sober&gt;relationship&gt;relapse&gt;left job of ten years with no plan&gt;got dui&gt;girlfriend left..I still didn't drink. Today begins a new chapter in my life. I'm going to do my best and I know even through all the self-doubt   that's going to be *more* than good enough. ..Thanks for always being here SD.

Hey I took the bait! Anchor; I believe in you. You can take a deep breath lower your shoulders go in there and be excellent. Most worries never come to pass. Kick ass enjoy your first day I will not drink with you today!
Hey good luck on your first day!..Be sure to be as friendly as you can! Assuming you're working full time you'll likely spend most of your waking hours with these people so you definitely want to make a good impression. You can also make some pretty neat after work friends which can help to pass the time help you to get to know the job better widen your social circle and broaden your skills. Your place of employment can offer you so many opportunities if you let it just let it all sink in and enjoy yourself. If you make mistakes brush it off. Get any mistakes out of the way now so that you can start kicking butt ASAP  ..Keep us posted..Iwndwyt 
My friend the most important thing in your life are those 168 days.  You've created this opportunity by being sober.  You are already a winner!! Have a great day on the new job!
