My "dream" job in the beverage industry is ending. Partially by choice (a natural offshoot of my decision to stop drinking). Partially because the company is ready to move on too. And even though I'm glad I'm not drinking and know that this is the best thing for me I'm still a hot mess of angst anxiety and emotions. To name a few:..1) FEAR. Fuuuuuck. What am I going to do for a job? I don't know what's next for me yet. And that voice of self-hatred inside my head is having a field day making it hard to focus on job-hunting. Behind it all is that sneaky little thought: Nice work. If only you weren't such a drunk you could have kept a good thing going. ..2) SHAME. I know I haven't been giving this job my all since I stopped drinking. Given that my all is usually 200% (I have boundary issues. Surprise.) maybe it's not such a big deal. And pulling back may have been necessary to the success of my sobriety. But it weighs on me mostly because.....3) EGO. I'm helping transition my work over to new replacements. And they're good. Really good. Which just fuels the fires of how much I suck...4) GRIEF. Nothing is black and white. And I mourn the loss of the good parts of this job (creativity great team) just as much as I acknowledge the bad parts (working from home day drinking) were really fucking bad for me.  ..I am trying to acknowledge accept and move on. But I find myself repeatedly entagled in (distracted by?) these things. Probably because struggling with them is somehow easier than facing the unknown. Or accepting my biggest fear -- that I'm flawed imperfect and not as good as I want and need everyone to think I am. ..Ding ding ding. That's the root of it all folks. Accepting that I am who I am warts weaknesses and all is both my biggest fear and the key to moving past it. Not entirely sure how to do that but it probably has something to do with one day at a time I'm guessing...Thanks for listening. IWNDWYT.

Your post is so introspective and insightful... sounds like you are well on your way to letting go of the negative self images (just as you have let go of certain negative parts of your lifestyle) while at the same time using your past experiences as learning devices to help forge a new and better life for yourself...Best wishes I will not drink with you today.
The hardest part of moving forward and getting better is realizing what the issues are - you seem to have a good grip on what some of those are. That's at least half the battle and it looks like you're doing a great job of it if you can come tell us about it! Bravo!! .I don't know where you are in your sober journey but if it's still kind of early I would like to say this to you - although stuff doesn't just exactly magically get fixed or better when you stop drinking it also sort of does day by day. We become aware of what our issues are because they kind of slap us in the face without the alcohol to hide behind so we are forced to deal with them. It can feel really ugly at times because especially in the beginning they sort of all jump out at once. But little by bit you will just naturally decide on the more and more adult ways to deal with those things. Better jobs are on the way because you are now better equipped by way of being sober to do a better job at all kinds of jobs. Write down the best parts of that job and stretch your mind a bit to see what fields/positions might give you some of what you loved in it minus the alcohol of course. Best of luck you are more ahead of the game than you realize! Delighted to not drink with you today!
