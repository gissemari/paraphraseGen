Relapsed the last 3 days. I have a SMART group tonight I need a lot of encouragement going to. The anxiety and self-hate is real today.

Don't give up! Sounds like you know what you need to do. Go do it. You're worth it. 
Keep at it!  The anxiety will decrease the more you can continue on this journey.  Good luck to you :)
You can do this!  ..I know what you mean about self-loathing.  I got so sick of that more sick than the physical effects of hangovers.  ..You deserve to be free of that.  We're all here rooting for you!..And...please let us know how the meeting goes!
