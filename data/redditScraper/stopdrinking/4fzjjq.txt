Thus far each day has been a struggle but I've held strong pushing through the desire to drink. It honestly hit my just now why I drank. It's because I was so angry at work school friends family etc. I may not have realized I was angry when I had a few beers but I know indeed I was. With this realization I can finally say this time around has already been successful. Time to treat myself with a nice cold refreshing cup of sparkling water.

Kudos for four days! Underneath anger are usually feelings of betrayal loss fear disappointment. Without help I would not have learned how to cope with these feelings and stay sober. Rehab therapy and AA gave me the tools. 
We can do this! I'll cheers to you with a refreshing La Croix! 
Excellent job on four days!
