Hey all..I'm just posting this to introduce myself. I'm a 25 yo college graduate who has been drinking heavily since 18. I don't want to go into detail but I drink large quantities of vodka every day. I'm sick of it and know I'm going to kill myself if I don't stop...In happier news I'm almost to a week sober and feel a million times better. I actually like being sober. Its better than the misery I was in when I was always drunk...My biggest fear is relapsing. My longest streak has been almost a month. I hear all kinds of stories on here of people relapsing after 8 months or 8 years and it freaks me out almost to the point of rationalizing drinking again because I won't stay sober anyways so why try to quit. I know that's ridiculous but that's what scares me...Any advice?

Don't worry about next month. Worry about today right now. Before you know it "next month" will be in the rear view mirror. Best of luck to you. Give a shout if you need it 
Welcome /u/stop_the_drink -- I look forward to seeing your posts and comments as you go along.
Hey welcome to SD and congrats on nearly a week! Have you got plans for the weekend to keep your mind busy so you don't fall back into old habits? 
Hi I'm also 25 and sober. The fear of relapsing and ending up hungover and suffering from anxiety attacks helped me a lot in the beginning. I think it's a healthy fear...I also try playing the tape forward and imagine how i'd feel if I ended up drinking again that usually does the trick and makes me think rational again.
