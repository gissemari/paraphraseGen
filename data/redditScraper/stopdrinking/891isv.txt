I learned one of my many lessons this weekend about moderation.  Moderation is a dangerous word I use to convince myself that I have not lost control of my behavior. The reality is I saw a speeding train of relapse heading directly for me in the form of a wedding vacation to New Orleans and I couldn't step off the tracks so I tired moderation. Turns out it is as bad of an idea as it sounds. IWNDWYT!

There is no such thing as moderation for me.  One drink leads to another and another then months then years!  Lessons learned all round.  Wishing you good luck. IWNDWYT!
Thanks for going out and conducting some valuable research!  What can you share that others might avoid the experience?
i find it the strangest part of being an addictive drinker  i can moderate for a couple of months and then the shit hits the fan.  I develop a craving for MORE at some point and the Moderation -game is over.....then the massive drunkards begin again
"Patience is required with all growth" I absolutely love that. Been having my own moderation mishap for the past week but did not drink yesterday or today and will reset the badge tomorrow. 
Thanks KingKozz
