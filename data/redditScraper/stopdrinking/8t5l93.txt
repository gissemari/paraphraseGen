I'm not gonna drink but I swear sometimes I wish I never stopped so I could just drink without thinking about it again. Just take a little break from reality and loosen up. Have some fun for a change..I'm off to a party I don't want to go to and I feel no joy. I have to go but I'm gonna make it a short one. I feel like I have nothing to look forward to except eternal drudgery and struggle. I'm pleased mostly with not drinking but sometimes - mostly - it is a goddamn drag.

Things are usually not as bad when we are actually in them.  Its all perspective friend.  I hope the party doesn't suck as bad as you are expecting.  
I guess you've already seen recommendations for *This Naked Mind*? Might help...From that book:..&gt; Even if you could gauge the exact amount to drink booze doesn't make you cleverer funnier more creative or more interesting. There is nothing inherent in alcohol that can do this. More often when a shy person gets drunk they end up emotional weepy and repetitive. We don't realize how bad we look when drinking because we are drunk and so is everyone else..&gt;     &lt;This Naked Mind: Control Alcohol: Find Freedom Discover Happiness &amp; Change Your Life&gt;(Grace Annie;Grace Annie) page 111..And:..&gt; Drinking does not make dull people fun. Alcohol makes smart and engaging people dumb and boring. Its very nature slows your brain function and dulls your wit and senses. People rendering themselves senseless are not entertained. What could be more boring than the monotony of experiencing life with only part of your senses? It is no fun to be controlled by a poison..&gt;     &lt;This Naked Mind: Control Alcohol: Find Freedom Discover Happiness &amp; Change Your Life&gt;(Grace Annie;Grace Annie) page 204..I found [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/rh0js/culture_of_drinking/c45vb1a/) about drinking because you think you're more fun with it socially very good too.
