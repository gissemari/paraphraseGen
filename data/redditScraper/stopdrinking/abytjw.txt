I am having such a hard time. I try to just drink a little as I quit because I know quitting exacerbates my depression anxiety and insomnia. I have no medical insurance and cant afford to detox medically. Any support or advice is welcome.

Speaking with your doctor is always a safe route but if you can't do that right now would you be interested in meetings?
Sorry to hear you're struggling!..Alcohol actually *causes* depression anxiety and sleep problems... these things might initially *feel* worse after stopping but eventually they start to get better if you stay sober.....Meetings of AA/SMART/Refuge Recovery/LifeRing are held all over the place and are essentially free and they may also be able to signpost you towards other free/low-cost services locally.....Best of luck and keep us posted!..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Sounds like you are tapering. The next step is to find support. There is a lot of free support. Not everyone needs a medical detox. 
Even without insurance I can go to urgent care for around $15-40 bucks.
