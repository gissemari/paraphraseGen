one of the things that occurred toward the end of my drinking was losing my vehicle. It was an old car and it broke down. After a month of sobriety I saved up to buy a brand new bike to commute. It was an awesome hybrid bike. Saved up and paid 400 for it...Today I was out enjoying the beautiful weather and ran into a store to look around. I didn't lock the bike up it was my mistake. The bike was unattended for maybe 5 minutes. When I came back out it was gone...My heart began pounding. Like a baby with a bottle I immediately wanted to escape this horrible moment...Sorry universe- it's not gonna fucking happen. I'm not fucking relapsing. You don't know who you're dealing with. I will succeed no matter how much shit you rain on me. ..Learn from mistakes- move on- stay sober.
