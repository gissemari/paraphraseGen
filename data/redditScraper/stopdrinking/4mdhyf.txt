I relapsed last night.  It has been almost two months and I then said to myself "pshh I have shown I don't need to drink I am not realllly an alcoholic." Well yes I am....I will not drink today.  And that is the only battle that matters...Keep on fighting the good fight SD.

Welcome back!
Welcome back! ..It's good that you have learned something from your relapse!
Thank you for sharing! It's a great reminder. I've had those same exact rationalizations every time I make it XX amount of days.

It never ceases to amaze me how many of us are fighting this fight and just how hard it can be to get on the right path and stay on it.... It is an insidious habit and incredibly hard to break my advice just keep on trying because I genuinely believe once you switch the switch in your head about the joys (or in real terms the pain) of drinking and see it for what it is the struggle gets a whole lot easier you just have to keep trying until the switch flicks and then it becomes a maintenance issue rather than a brand new construction problem....if that makes sense! The switch will flick it did for me and I never thought it would or could.
That was yesterday for me too and am really fighting to not do it again but will not allow myself to do it. Keep up the good work!
