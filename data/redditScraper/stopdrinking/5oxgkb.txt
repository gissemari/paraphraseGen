Hello! Long time lurker first time poster. ..I've really fucked my life up now. Lost friends and my job bc I was completly wasted. I'm young but I've struggled with this for several years now and I'm really tierd. I blame my anxiety but in truth my anxiety comes from drinking myself shitfaced all the time. ..But I'm alone and the withdrawal is killing me. It's really hard not to open a bottle.

I was honest with my doctor about my drinking and received medication to make detox safer and easier. I also grabbed all the support I could find including a therapist and AA. I had no clue how to get sober on my own.
If you have some in the house you might want to consider dumping it out.   It will mess with your head if it's that close by. 
Read up on what alcohol does to your body and brain.  It took a long time for that info to sink into my head.  I also read a lot on what "moderate" drinking is - no more than one for a woman or two for a man - in one day.  I had to realize that I never moderated.  You have to start somewhere.  I will not drink today!
The mind plays tricks!  Don't give in.  Think back.  Do you want that again?
