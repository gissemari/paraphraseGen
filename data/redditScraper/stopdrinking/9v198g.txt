So I finally decided to signup and post. I have been sober for 5 years (checking in on SD periodically) and recently relapsed 5 months ago. I keep telling myself I can do it alone but obviously not. I am hoping a community like this will be a step in the right direction.

You're in good hands  
Welcome out of lurker mode :)...Feel free to request a [badge](http://sd.bot.nu/badgedate/).
Welcome! I have found this subreddit so supportive and welcoming and I am sure that you will too. Do you mind if I ask what strategies you used to support yourself during those 5 years?
I was a lurker about this time last year. My reddit age will hit one year in 20 days. This place has been my foundation motivation and salvation. Welcome you're in the right place...D
