We're all here for you! I'm very new to this. I'm only on day 8 but I wouldn't have done it without the support of the amazing people on here.   
You can do this. You are made of really strong stuff. You deserve happiness and health. One moment at a time. One day at a time. I won't be drinking with you today.
Glad you're here.  Sorry to hear about this struggle...With support and work everything got better for me...I find immediate support from meetings.
