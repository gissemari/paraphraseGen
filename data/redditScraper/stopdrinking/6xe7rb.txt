I've been trying to quit for such a long time at least a few years now. We average nearly $1000 a month going out to bars just for beer (not to mention what we spend on it with meals which I don't track) and my doctor noticed it in my blood work a few years back yet I just can't quit...These days I have no desire to start. Instead my spouse and I just have a desire to leave the house (we both work from home) which always winds up as "let's just walk down to our favorite watering hole." Are friends are there (some seriously good friends not just drinking buddies) we can socialize etc. I've tried getting us involved in volunteer work and other things but due to the demographics of where we live (median age is over 50) just about everything caters to retired people and for those of us who work during the day it's almost impossible to get involved...How do y'all do it? I mean how can an extrovert like myself keep social when all I know is the bar scene? If I can find an answer to that I think I'll finally be able to say "no I will not drink with you today" for good.

* **Food**: get a slow cooker. Throw in ingredients done. Use oven cooking. SO much easier than regular cooking. Aluminium foil dump veggies with spices add protein maybe potatoes if that's your thing close bake. Done. Get in the habit of making doubles of everything. Put 2 lasagna's in the oven freeze the other one. Buy lbs of ground beef on special. Make patties ([here's how to easily shape them](http://savorysweetlife.com/2010/05/shaping-perfect-hamburger-patties/). Keep a few in the fridge freeze the others. Nothing is better than being able to just microwave add cheese and whatever and **bam!** -- hamburger..* **Extrovert**: not 100% one at all but let me try... Sports? Tennis soccer basket ball -- any team sport really. Water fitness yoga classes. Great places to meet people and make friends. Meetups like the [Tampa Bay young professionals](https://www.meetup.com/YoungTampa/). 
I second food. Find a bar with food. Be appetizers guy. Usually they're the same price as a drink or 2. Then don't order a drink! Or if you can't do that stay in a have bbqs. Food is an amazing socializer tho.
