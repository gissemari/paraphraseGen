The rockiest road of my drinking is in the past since I've gone on medication for anxiety years ago. No more blackouts or weird regrets. An SSRI. It was a struggle and mostly I'm through it...These days my problem is that drinking is keeping me F A T. My impulses to have wine (my kryptonite) are still too strong. But other than keeping me a fatty (REASON ENOUGH) there aren't as many things pushing me to stop now. I know I need to either stop completely or radically change my own rules around it. Likely stopping completely is best...I would like to go to an AA meeting but I worry that if I - in my tentative stages around completely abandoning drinking - would be a weirdo. Can I go to a "closed group"? I don't know the rules. ..I know I have a problem after years of dealing with mental health issues my drinking is mainly a physical health thing (right so I should stop). It keeps me from losing weight. I will have a bottle of wine when I sit down to write (creative job) but then I'll have a glass of water and hit the hay. ..Do people from AA hang out socially? I feel like part of what I need is just more friends who don't drink - to change my perceptions around social activities. ..Sorry for the ramble.

Hello and welcome. Typically closed AA meetings are for people who identify as alcoholic or "have a desire to stop drinking"- different meetings might be more or less strict about that requirement though I can't speak for all meetings. If you don't think you're an alcoholic I would just try an open meeting. ..Many AA folks do hang out socially and that can be a way to meet people who do not socialize around alcohol. My concern with going to AA with a desire to learn to moderate might not be the right way to approach it. However many people come to AA uncertain that they are alcoholics or that they want to quit for good and in the process learn that they are much better off without it or that AA provides the support they need to quit drinking. .In my experience there is nothing to lose by trying an open meeting. This site is also a great place to find support and inspiration to stop drinking! .I hope that helps. 
You will absolutely be welcome at a closed meeting. AA is for anyone with a desire to stop drinking. If you have that you are welcome...Socially AA is great too. Last weekend I hung out with friends from the program and this weekend Iam going to as well. I have at least twenty people who I can call who will answer. ..Hope that helps!
Wine made me FAT too. I have already lost over 10 lbs and plan to lose 20 more to get back to my ideal weight. I am miserable and depressed when I'm overweight. Just one of many reasons for staying sober. When I think of all the sugar I was consuming I get grossed out. Blecchhh...I have really enjoyed the fellowship of AA in the past. Now I live in a small town w/out easy access to meetings so this SD community has becoming my support group...Wishing you all the best. Thanks for sharing...
Thanks for this post I couldn't have wrote it better myself... and I have tried to ask these same things I have these issues/questions too!
*The one thing I did learn is open meetings you can bring people! ( I went alone but it is nice to know if I am having a particularly anxiety high day I can drag someone with me lol) I Thought closed meetings were like invite only lol but they just mean its for the recovery person only.
