Struggling a little bit on this end.   Not drinking has made me feel kinda isolated.  I know its temporary while new friends and activities start to surface but still sucks in this dry limbo of transition..&amp;#x200B;..I've been dating a guy long distance for 3 years.   He supports me not drinking and we see each other every month but the waiting is hard.  I just started going back to the gym (which feels amazing) taking a class at night/online to buff my resume and everything is going great at my job.  I just feel like I am talking to less people than I used to when I was drinking because that was some major social lubricant to finding stuff to do...&amp;#x200B;..Im reaching out to friends and filling my time to stay busy but it still feels so lonely/isolating.  Maybe this is my brain downshifting away from the buzz of alcohol all the time or im discovering why I was drinking in the first place.  Im not sure.   Anyone ever felt like this or know a good solution for it?    ...Im in my 6th week or so of not drinking and digging it.   Just dont know how to chase these blues away.

&gt;Tonight I went to the gym did some work on my class and am going to meet a friend for a bit...That sounds like a great and productive night to me!
You could always choose a couple things that might interest you and then look to see if there is a meetup in your area.  I've never done it but i've been tempted many times.
That restless feeling of ennui will fade over time. Don't worry you're not doing anything wrong or missing out on any fun. It's just your body readjusting to the feeling of not being stimulated with alcohol.
