my sleep isnt consistent yet but its getting better. Red dry patches on my skin are clearing and my poops are solid and glorious..Brain fog is heavy and Its taking willpower not to let the rage take hold. My last relapse was only a short one and the benifits are coming on a lot quicker. If you fall of the bandwagon get back on it quick.

I'm glad you hopefully hopped back on the wagon quickly and you're seeing the benefits :) keep it up!
Nice job getting back on the wagon. I too just jumped back on after falling off briefly. IWNDWYT. Hugs!  
apologies that I'm late guys
