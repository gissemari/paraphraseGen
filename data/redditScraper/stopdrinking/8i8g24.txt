Hi all this week has been quite a roller coaster of emotions as they say "in sobriety you FEEL better you feel EVERYTHING better."..After my saga with the harrassing boss from hell (death threats coersion blackmail wrongfully terminated/evicted (I lived where I worked) had to call the cops to move my shit) I moved back in with my parents where my parents and bro are all active addicts so much so that my dad brags about it in front of me "I know you're getting sober but I'm gonna get high heh heh heh"..So just trying to weather this completely different storm and it's caused me to "emotionally relapse" where I am on defensive mode just trying to escape/throw up boundaries left and right where I can. I can't practice loving kindness because I'm too low right now...I got another job offer last week for (what seems like) my dream job and I had to complete a couple of courses and forward the HR lady the certificates of completion. ..The HR manager said "I appreciate that you turned this around so quickly!" and I broke out in tears...It's the first time in like a month and a half that someone has said anything remotely positive to me in the workplace for something I've done. ..It's so simple. Be kind to each other. It could very easily make someone's day (or for me my entire month)..IWNDWYT
