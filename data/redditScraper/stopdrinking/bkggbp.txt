I guess I always thought I'd have something figured out by now. The career path or the spouse or the property ownership or the travel experiences or something. I don't think of life as checking boxes off anymore but I still carry some of my lifelong expectation that life will eventually be easy - or at least routine with support and not struggling to carve out a space for myself every day. But maybe it never gets easy. Maybe life will just be long muddled string of challenges and pain and struggling with patches of contentment and joy like flowers in the sidewalk. Or maybe it doesn't have to be anything. Maybe it can just be. And I can try to be okay with that...&amp;#x200B;..Today I have my health. I did my favorite yoga poses on the floor while watching two marvel movies in a row since I don't use alcohol to silence my brain anymore. A critic I like says novels are important because they give us a sense of scale and narrative in our own lives. I don't have that despite my incessant reading. I am feeling miserable and have been disassociating all week and wanting badly to self-harm through exercise (an old coping mechanism). But I won't do any of that. Trudging forward. I will not drink with you today.
