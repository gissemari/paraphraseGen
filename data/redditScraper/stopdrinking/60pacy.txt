I have to let my thoughts out...I am in my mid 20s. I got sober earlier this year. After a year of heavy drinking I decided to quit... and it was easy for me as the benefits of complete sobriety were clear to me after a few days...I went just over a month sober... and it was easy... but I relapsed. And I relapsed hard; the past month is a blur. From the moment I get off work till I decide to stop poisoning myself in the evening I drink 10-12 strong IPA beers. That has been my routine now. My abdomen is burning as I type. I know something is wrong with my body right now because of what I have been doing...All my closest people are so frustrated with me and I don't blame them. I feel alone although I know I am not. I want company so I can be distracted but I also don't want to be around anyone anymore. I think I am heavily depressed too. ..I quit the first time and I don't know how to fucking do it again.....I have work soon and well I have the active effort in mind to just not drink. So that is a start. ..I don't even know why I am posting on here; I suppose just by writing out how miserable I have become and keeping sobriety in mind maybe I can win today and resist. ..Anyway I thank you in advance for listening to me whine about my stupid decisions. ..Have a good one people... hopefully I can join you in sober life again.
