Good morning SD! sorry for long ramble post..today i woke up on saturday morning and not being hangover in a very long time. it feels good i have energy and motivation to do stuff but most of all I'm proud. was a bit of a struggle last night at around 9 pm when i got asked to join at the bar. since i'm quite fresh to this sobriety thing  going out would very likely have ruined my first clean week. luckily i saw a post here on SD exactly about friday night rollercoaster which was enough to switch away from the "maybe i should go out"-way of thinking (my f*cking brain is a f*cking asshole sometimes) to more along "no no keep it together sit tight dont let this random question ruin the commitment do something qick find a distraction"  so i messaged the OP and went to the #stopdrinking chat which i heard was a good place for distraction. and chat delivered! very well actally. im not going to give all the credit to the chat peeps i already said im very proud of myself but i am grateful. .tl;dr proud to be not hangover this saturday morning and grateful to a reminder post on SD and the #stopdrinking chat
