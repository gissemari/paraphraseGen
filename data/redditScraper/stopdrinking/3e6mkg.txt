Hey guys!! Hey guys!! Happy Wednesday! [And in case you missed it from last week's comments...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1EeP56JWAg&feature=youtu.be&t=6s)..Let's hump it out on this happy day! Hump days are when we calibrate our sobriety check in see how our /sd buds are doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations in the format below...**Triumph**: Bear with me on this; it's a long one. ..As I've mentioned my struggles to get sober lasted years. I promised myself hundreds of times that I'd quit drinking and I failed hundreds of times. If you're struggling you'll probably hear a lot of people suggest that you try changing things in your life to help ensure successes. It took me a long time to internalize that. About a year ago [I read this poem](https://www.uic.edu/orgs/convening/resistan.htm). (It's short I promise.) I read it over and over and hung it on my fridge...So in my neighborhood there's a big hole in the sidewalk. I walked over it for years and I had this idea in my head that if my regular gait put my step right in the middle of the hole it was going to be a shitty day and I might as well drink and I managed to step right over it well I was in for a successful day (and I might as well celebrate with a drink!)..I haven't thought about this much in the past year until last week I saw that they had patched the hole with that awesome smooshy permeable paving. The hole was gone! I couldn't fall in it any more! ..I spent the past 359 days changing so many things in my life breaking those neural connections between "alcohol" and "reward." The hole in the sidewalk will always be there but it's less dangerous to me than it was before. It's less accessible. ..Occasionally the universe rewards our struggles by bashing us over the head with symbolism we can't ignore. That patched hole is my triumph this week!..**Struggle**: I had a rough day this week and as I was leaving work a fully formed thought popped into my head "Man I could use a drink." BOOM. Just like that like it was never gone. I was able to recognize it smile at it and let it go. But it's a great reminder that well that the hole will always be there waiting. ..**General Chat**: Do you have any poems or sayings that you like to reference when you're struggling? Share them here - maybe it'll be the spark to help a white belt in sobriety reach that next level!..More important how are you guys doing? How has this week been for you? Let us know your triumphs and struggles!

**[The Egg](http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html)** is pretty good....[Hump daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwrstxuicZk)
Yo Wednesday. .Struggle: My sleep schedule is embarrassingly atrocious. There's a lot of room for improvement. ..Triumph: was honest with my aunt about orthodontic work I'm having done that she thought was dumb and vain to spend money on. I was hiding it from her but then I thought about that 'ol honesty post and I came clean. It was good for me. My occasional lies were so deeply embedded in me that when I initially read that post I was like 'I don't lie about anything' then the next day I thought of like five things. I truly probably wouldn't have done that if it wasn't for that post and the surrounding posts. So thanks Crosby thanks sd...General chat: just trying to figure out why I sleep like a psychopathic vampire on a speedball of adderall and ambien when I'm totally sober. And yes I've tried actually everything 
Longest continuous stretch of sobriety in my adult life. ..Triumph: A big one accepted job offer in my field. It's an amazing opportunity and I feel so fortunate to be in this position after years of waiting. ..Struggle: It's a big job so there's a nervousness present. Also wrapping up my projects at current job in next 10 days is daunting. ..General Chat: I've really enjoyed following the Tour de France this year anyone else?
**Triumph:** Work has been rough lately. The business isn't doing so well there's been a ton of changes in management and a lot of the projects I've been working on would make it much easier for them to get rid of me if they wanted to. I had a good talk with my boss this week and he wants me to be part of the core network group moving forward and I got a nice bonus too. It's a big relief to know I'm part of the future plan....**Struggle:** One of my dogs has been struggling with health issues. She was doing a lot better with some new medication we are giving her but she seems to have taken a few steps backwards over the past couple of days...**General Chat:** I like this verse from [The Avett Brothers: *When I drink*:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qq7dTtq_uiI)..*But when I drink*..*I spend the next morning in a haze*..*But we only get so many days*..*Now I have one less*..*Just do your best*..*It's the only way to keep that last bit of sanity*..*Maybe I don't have to be good but I can try to be*..*At least a little better than I've been so far*..*Oh at least a little better than I've been so far*....
**Triumph**: I didn't let a bad decision on Sunday turn into "Well I guess I'm drinking again now" and just give up like I have in the past. ..**Struggle**: Trying to get my head around why I chose to drink. If I had been honest with a person who is very important to me I wouldn't have been in the situation that led me to drinking in the first place. ..**General Chat**: Trying to keep myself busy and engaged in what I'm doing. Even if it's something boring like cleaning if I can keep my mind engaged with what I'm doing it has less chance to wander to places I don't want it to go. 
Having a pretty good week even though I haven't been sleeping well (not booze related this time!)..Struggle: Sleep sucks lately but for a good reason (we'll get there). Work has been insane the last few weeks with our production schedule in full swing...Triumph: Not reallllly my triumph but my GF of 7 years just got offered a job that will nearly double her pay ($90k). After 2 years of her struggling for recognition of her work horrible bosses with crazy turn over and her latest boss taking credit for all the work she did..The board decided to out the current boss and promote my GF to that position!.We're so excited! We can move out of our apartment and get a dog and save a buttload more money!.But with the excitement and whirlwind of everything going on it's been taking a toll on my sleep but not anymore!..General chat: Almost 200 days! holy crap! .Also with regards to my GF's promotion: YYYYEEEEAAAAASSSSSS!!!!
**Triumph:** I'm starting to use my sobriety for things that I've neglected and it's giving me peace.  I've really kind of been like Dr. Grant in Jurassic Park as far as alcohol (or a T-Rex) is concerned - It can't see me if I don't move.. So I've basically been a recluse. Finally feeling confident enough to move a little and better my situation feels good. ..**Struggle:** See above....**Chit Chat:** It's not really a saying but I listened to a talk on youtube where a guy referenced being "Crucified between two thieves.  One is the regret shame and remorse of yesterday - the other is the fear dread and uncertainty of tomorrow."  I don't know why but I've been thinking about that a lot recently. Anyway thanks for each day SD!
Triumph: Haven't even thought about drinking in the last 3 days. Cravings are going down skin looks healthier and I've been getting more stuff done. I feel like i am over the psychological hump as I have been socially alcohol 3-4 times and declined. All my friends and family know I am abstaining from alcohol and are very supportive. ..Struggle: Looking in the future towards events I certainly want to drink at. Going to New Orleans in Dec and brother wants to take me to bourbon street. Certainly want to stay sober but that sounds super fun. Maybe it will be more fun sober :D
**Triumph** I got 3 huge compliments yesterday. One of my professors said he gave me the highest mark that he has ever given anyone on a project. Honestly I got home and cried. ..**Struggle** Life's good man. Everything is temporary anyways :)..**General chat** [Dammit Canada you are making us look bad!](http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/ashley-madison-says-1-in-5-ottawans-subscribed-to-adulterer-website-1.3162638)
**Triumph** Went to a comedy show tonight (Amy Schumer) and had the most fun ever.  Friends were drinking but it didn't even cross my mind.  I don't think booze would have made it any funnier just more expensive and I would have been busting to pee. ..**Struggle** I think a colleague is going to get a promotion over me because he's better at selling himself. Nothing is confirmed yet  but very tough times. ..**Chat** I go to AA Thursday Friday and Sunday and kind of miss it between Sunday and Thursday. I'm going to check out a new one on Tuesday. 
**TRIUMPH:** I had a great weekend. I spent time hanging out with my wife found a new restaurant we really like (where I've never drank and won't associate it) went to my first AA meeting saw Ant Man with a buddy of mine and basically was just in a good mood all weekend.  ..**Struggle:**  I'm dealing with the wife and my teenage sons and their ongoing inability to communicate without getting crappy. But I'm not escaping into a bottle any longer to drown my misery. ..**General Chat:** I finished reading Allen Carr's EasyWay to Control Alcohol.  Frankly I found the writing repetitive and tedious. Yes I get his message and will appreciate parts of it but I don't think getting over alcoholism is quite as easy as he makes it. And I'm a person who since the first week I quit drinking hasn't had many struggles with drinking.  
After Sunday's relapse I struggled with the guilt and shame the following day but I got myself to a meeting last night. I allowed peer pressure from co-workers to get the better of me. I even puked on the bedroom and living room carpet a real shit show. ..Triumph-.I finally recognize the severity of my drinking and what it does to me as well as others around me. This took a VERY long time to recognize but it finally hit me like REALLY hit me. I feel like I truly 'get it' now.
**triumph** 140 days without alcohol! that's five months! that's twenty weeks! WHAT! -- i'm working again my anxiety is gone my relationship with the SO has improved tenfold and i've been waking up at seven every morning to make healthy breakfast smoothies (chia hemp and flax yo) that really improve my mood throughout the day. ..**struggle** trying to get my social life back together. i realized that i have no non-alcohol related hobbies or interests so that was scary. it feels like i'm starting my whole life over -- so terrifying but also kind of nice...**general chat** hi all! i'm a long time lurker. i don't attend any meetings or have any IRL alcohol free friends so i figured it was probably time to get involved. 
Triumph:  After months and months of lurking here I finally was able to get over my fear of being judged and started to participate (yay me!).  ..Struggle: Still dealing with feelings of guilt and regret over past behaviors and poor choices made while I was drinking...General Chat: Any other sober gardeners out there?  For years I wanted to grow my own food.  I never got around to it because I was too busy being a raging alcoholic.  This is the first year that I was able to plant a full veggie garden and it's been awesome!  Turns out weeding is a great way to deal with anxiety.  Who knew?!
**Triumph:** This morning I had the thought (as I do multiple times every day) that quitting *really means* quitting that I will never be able to have "just one" not even that one that I'm pretty sure the local bar makes using magic. But this time it didn't immediately blacken my mood and cause me to crave a drink. That's new...**Struggle:** I'll be seeing family this weekend when my brother comes to town to play a show. There's no possibility that they won't notice that I'm not drinking and they're going to ask and it's really anxiety-inducing for me. Usually I'd just have a few to keep up appearances but it's probably a good thing that I'm not seeing that as an option...**General Chat:** I've had this little poem on my Facebook page since 2004 (you can tell how much I use Facebook). As someone who's dealt with severe anxiety my whole life it's been bittersweet a lot of times but it makes me realize that I'm not the only one who feels that way and I like that it makes a point of how silly it is without minimizing how it feels..."Some of your hurts you have cured..And the sharpest you still have survived..But what torments of grief you endured..From evils which never arrived!"..--Ralph Waldo Emerson
Doncha just love the messages that pop up in your life when your eyes are open? Great share thanks!..*Triumph*: I am seeing how much more even-keeled my emotions are sober and how I can handle daily frustrations or challenges without such a strong surge of irritation and without taking them so personally. Lo the resurgence of my sense of humor! I kinda thought maybe I outgrew it....*Struggle*: As the fog recedes and I gain clarity I feel inundated by all of the changes I feel I need to make in myself and my life. I'm trying to give myself time to just make sobriety my number one focus and not berate myself too much for all of my perceived flaws in need of attention....*General Chat*: I'm loving this sub the spirit of support and helpfulness found here and how much folks vocalize their appreciation for it as well. Y'all really are helping keep me focused on recovery and positive change. Thank you! Waiting on my flight to visit the parents right now and while there is some apprehension about staying strong I really feel confident I can come here and get the support I need should I feel vulnerable..
Adding another day!
Triumph:  I made it through my vacation sober and without smoking weed. Go me.  I went out to bars with friends for the first time and did not drink and while it wasn't always fun it was survivable.  Also I feel less like I am missing out now. Since coming home I've had a few setbacks and disappointments but I am handling them with grace and humor...Struggle:  My ex is in a bad place.  He calls me drunk and tells me about how unhappy he is the drugs he is now using how he wants to end his existence.  I feel guilty for being so much happier now that he is gone.  I almost feel guilty for being in a new and 100000X better relationship.  I should probably stop talking to him but we still have bills and stuff tied up together so I feel like we should keep the lines of communication open.  Also I wish we could just be friends but I don't think I can be friends with self destructive unhappy addicts anymore...General Chat: I like this song about being sober. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzTlt5tTjPc  Give it a listen.
**Triumph:** Things are good. Had friends over one evening and I opened beers for them and my wife. It was notable only because I noted the lack of feeling...**Struggle:** Working on my work/life balance and prioritizing what I need to get done vs what I wish to do.....**Chat:** I found the [The Desiderata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desiderata) to be very helpful early on. I recite it much less now but still try to hold to the ideas.
Struggle: Wednesday is rough day for me at work and I'd usually have a couple beers after work and the gym to relax. It's not much of a struggle but it's something that crossed my mind...Triumph: I had dinner with my family last night which I would usually have a couple drinks. I just passed the wine along and enjoyed my meal without the few glasses of wine so that was good!..General chat: what types of habits do some of you folks have/ used to have that would trigger the desire to stop drinking? Just curious. 
**Triumph:** I'm here. ..**Struggle:** 14-year-old daughter. Oy. I hope to regain intelligence as she gets older...**Chat:** Discovered a new line for myself. I occasionally use a little red wine in a sauce and I'm good with that (so no debate ya pikers). Last night the cork was stuck reversed end out in a previously opened bottle. I opened it with my teeth. Nothing happened but I won't do that again. 
**Triumph:** I wore a bathing suit a few times already this summer and no one dropped dead or ran away screaming.  I also didn't hate myself the entire time.  ..**Struggle:** Acceptance of my life as it is.  I don't talk about it a lot on here but my partner has pretty aggressive PPMS.  It sucks.  I am so fucking terrified of the future.  Every bit of it terrifies me mainly financial stuff right now.  And I know I didn't cause it and I definitely can't change it but fuck I hate it all the same.  It is such a strain on all of us...**Chat:** [Hole in the Sidewalk](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/95085-i-walk-down-the-street-there-is-a-deep-hole)..&gt; I walk down the street..There is a deep hole in the sidewalk..I fall in..I am lost... I am helpless..It isn't my fault..It takes forever to find a way out...&gt;I walk down the same street..There is a deep hole in the sidewalk..I pretend I don't see it..I fall in again..I can't believe I am in the same place..But it isn't my fault..It still takes me a long time to get out...&gt;I walk down the same street..There is a deep hole in the sidewalk..I see it is there..I still fall in. It's a habit..My eyes are open..I know where I am..It is my fault. I get out immediately...&gt;I walk down the same street..There is a deep hole in the sidewalk..I walk around it...&gt;I walk down another street. 
What up Wednesday!!..Triumph: Re-learning just how to work a program of recovery. My mornings are full of gratitude (as well as pre-coffee fog) instead of resentment...Struggle: Letting family issues get in the way of my progress. Still learning to let go of things out of my control and be okay with "the process".....General Chat: I had a visit with a new chiropractor this week and my back feels SO MUCH BETTER
Wow.  That's an awesome poem.  I love how it relates to the struggle many of us have...**Triumph**: I just spent the better part of this week at a company conference.  There was lots and lots of booze.  I was a little concerned that the booze would cause me some stress (though there was zero concern that I'd drink).  But there was zero stress too.  The only weird part was when one guy was walking around with a glass of strong scotch (is there any other kind?).  I can still smell it two days later.  But it was great to wake up bright-eyed when so many others were struggling from their exploits the night before.  And there was no shot at having hotel staff have to help me into my room or making a fool out of myself for being drunk.  I even got into a conversation about some Belgian beers with some dude.  I said the words "Those were my favorites" without feeling like I missed them.  I may have liked them before but I don't long for any of them at all...**Struggle**: Just been busy...**General Chat**: I have a big time celebration with a friend next week.  I'm extremely excited for and proud of my friend.  We're going to get together and have a nice meal.  Being a part of this friend's life is one of my favorite parts of mine.
