Through some introspection now that I'm sober I have come to a conclusion. This may not be a new thought but it's one I agree with. ..When we go back to drinking after a time or relapse there is a reason we can't drink normally. We have conditioned or trained our brains to drink in this manner. For instance when we are young we learn to ride a bike or play a certain sport. The longer we practice this activity the more our brains are conditioned to the activity. I played tennis for ten years in my teens. I became quite good. After a 15 years lapse I would still remember how to play should I begin again. I would not return to the time before I ever picked up a racket...Anyways I hope that this attempted insight helps someone. Stay warm!

Yes and sobriety is like the bike.  It is something that can't be taught it has to be learned.  IWNDWYT
Yes yes yes!!! Makes total sense and very helpful to hear. That's why for many of us- thinking we can moderate doesn't work. We go right back to the way we were drinking!
