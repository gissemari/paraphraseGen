My father has been sober for a year [today](http://imgur.com/T1K7JLI). I am so proud of him and of anyone who can fight alcoholism and win.  ..I was told since I was young that my family almost wasn't a family because of his alcoholism. He relapsed after almost two decades and our family was again in danger of survival. But he stopped drinking joined a program and transformed as a person.   ..He recently told me that during his days of drinking he had a plan to commit suicide. The only thing that stopped him was a glitch in the plans my mother and I had. I will never forget the day he told me that.  ..My father used to be dark and angry. We would fight a lot and I wouldn't tell my mother about the beers he had while she was out of the house. Everything is different now. Our relationship is wonderful and open and full of love and trust and respect.  ..I believe anyone can change I wish the best of luck to all of you.

Congrats to him and to you.  May it ever be so.
Congrats to him. I am so happy for you and for your family :)..I like to think that my sober anniversary is my new birthday too. I was born again as a better daughter sister and aunt - Just like your dad was born again to be better for himself and for you!

This is awesome! My dad like yours relapsed after nearly 2 decades of sobriety. He just had his 8 year "birthday" and I'll never forget the day he called me and told me he had got his 24 hr coin and I could just hear the difference in his voice. Truly a great feeling so happy for you and your family!
Wonderful!!!!...Just a thought.  Does he know you posted his picture?
