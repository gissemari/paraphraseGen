Relapsed yesterday. Felt like a drink after 3 pm. And nothing would stop me. The voice took over me. Its an evil voice. Always gets me. Will be working on how to shut it up next time. Two bottles of wine and cugarretes. So unhealthy.. feel sad but glad i be better tomorrow.

Sounds awful glad you're back!..I found the book '*Alcohol Explained*' and the book/YouTube '*This Naked Mind*' really helpful for understanding my drinking problem and permanently changing the way I view alcohol - they are well worth a look if you've not seen them.....I call that little voice the Booze Goblin and he's a crafty little bugger... I found that the longer I starved him of alcohol the weaker he became until eventually he vanished altogether!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
That voice is the worst! Thanatos lives in us all and wants us in the ground. ..Happy you're here and already on the up! I won't drink with you today. 
Nothing changes if nothing changes. What tangible actions are you going to take to remain sober?
I have found that the voice never does completely go away. It comes down to how do I react to the when I hear it. It does get easier with more sober time.
