The days are going by faster. But the struggle is real. Last night I half way had myself convinced to just relax and have a couple. No big deal I can handle it. What stopped me? Oddly making it to 8 months on this board. It seems like a silly little thing and yet its the way my brain works and so I am grateful. Today like the previous 239 days I am not drinking. Not even one..

Good deal. Not drinking with you today. I know that feeling the insidious voice of sure-a-couple-can't-hurt. Like you remembering the number I don't want to throw away helps. It is silly but silly that works. Cheers!
It's what keeps me going. Not sure I could handle the guilt if I did I would but know the anxiety would be through the roof  thanks everyone and I won't drink with you today 
I agree with you. Just keeping my number climbing is enough incentive for the moment. I come back to thinking about this number and it gives me encouragement. Here's to my 1/12th and and to your 2/3rds. 
WTG.  That is great.  Was there a trigger?  I won't drink with you today.
Weird me too.
