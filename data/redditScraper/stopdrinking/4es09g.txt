I've been away from this sub for a few months because I relapsed.  Badly.  I feel so ashamed of myself...A couple of shooters a few months ago led to a pint of 100 proof booze last night.  I took 4 shots in the car on my way home and 4 more once I got there.  I woke up today feeling just fine but knowing that this isn't acceptable...Last weekend my wife got blackout wasted at a toddler's birthday party...The day after I got blackout wasted at home...We know it's a problem but we can't stop.  I am not the father the husband the friend the employee the person I can be because of booze.  I fucking hate it.  But I can't stop...I've done the baby steps...I've done the meetings...I've done nearly a year without booze...And I keep crawling back to this evil mistress that is eventually going to kill me if I don't kill her first.

I'm glad you're back. How about not drinking with us today? Just today. Be present today. Be clear headed today.
Hello. I'm sorry you are struggling. From what you report I am very concerned about any children in your home. ...**When it becomes more difficult to suffer than to change;**. .**We will change.**

Welcome back. I to will join you today today is day 2 for me..Do not forget the wasted days it helps me fight back the urges and remember I do not want to be the person I was.
Even though my kids are now grown up (24 24...twins...and 26) it seems that at least once or twice a week a situation comes up with them and they need mine or my hubby's help. Today was urgent. One of the twins had day surgery yesterday. This a.m. I had to rush her to the Doctor to see why she was in so much pain who then had her taken by ambulance to emergency with me in tow. She is still there with another surgery scheduled for tomorrow afternoon. Thankfully I was sober not hungover and could deal with the situation. I like that feeling much better than the shame blame and guilt attached to not being present and aware. So today I am now home. Daughter is settled in hospital room and I will not drink so I am ready for tomorrow's challenges.
"We know it's a problem but we can't stop. I am not the father the husband the friend the employee the person I can be because of booze. I fucking hate it. But I can't stop."..This was me. I finally realized I had no control over alcohol. I realized I was an alcoholic. Being drunk every day and blacking out most evenings was my life until I finally realized what I was. ..Everyone has a different path. I really hope that what you said here is your moment of truth. That point where you make the decision you need to make. ..Kudos to you on sharing this. I'll not drink with you today.
