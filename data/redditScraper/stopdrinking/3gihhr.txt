I decided to quit drinking see my previous post from yesterday and today I was struggling had a terrible day at work and have been struggling with anxiety. I was craving a beer or four and then I saw some news on my Facebook. A guy I went to school with is currently a rep for student resorts out in Malia. It's famous for getting fucked up and just general debauchery. The UK equivalent of spring break if you will. Well on Saturday he got absolutely wasted and punched a dude the dude fell backwards and smashed his head on the pavement. The guy he punched died on impact and he's on bail on a manslaughter charge. That gentleman is what drinking does to you. Stay strong.

Ugh.... that's a good reminder. One night of heavy drinking can change your life forever. Or end it even. 
Yikes. :-(
Wow. A real tragedy but something you needed to hear right when you heard it. Hang in there. For me the first week has been the worst as far as cravings and just the actual behaviors that go with drinking. But we're here and we've been where you are. 
I'm not religious at all but one of the phrases that has stuck with me a lot in sobriety is "but for the grace of god there go I". ..I know that it was only luck that kept me from getting into any serious legal trouble when I was drinking. It was a very tough realization when I was finally honest with myself about how lucky I was to find AA before I wound up in jail or worse...I find those thoughts to be a good reminder of what can happen anytime my brain starts to tell me that one drink "can't be that bad. "
Unfortunately tragic stories like this are sometimes what we need to keep us grounded. Horrific!
