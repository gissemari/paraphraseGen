It finally happened to me like a lot of you I had a dream that I got totally smashed and relapsed. I was drinking in my dream and cursing at myself at the same time I woke up sweating and relieved it was in fact just a dream and I am still going strong. It is true what they say on here once you start getting to a certain point you don't think about alcohol as much and the days start to rack up. I rolled over 80 today! Thank you to all the great people that contribute to this sub we all appreciate you. Have a great Thursday everyone!

I've had a few of those dreams and I always wake up in a panic. Then I realize it was just a dream I'm super grateful that's all it was. Happy Thursday friend!
