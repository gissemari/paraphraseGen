i suffer from obsessive compulsive disorder. have since i was a little kid. control/lack of control is a huge trigger and ongoing struggle for me. i have been in therapy for nearly five years now and the progress is impressive but this is still something i face on a daily basis...my therapist states that my issue with control forces me to live in a black and white world and that learning to live in the grey is where i will find better balance. she believes that my ocd would greatly benefit from learning to muscle through though the uncertain and exist without such a narrow viewpoint...when i told my family and friends that i was quitting drinking and they all said that i was overreacting and of course my therapist stated i was being very black and white about it. but the reality is that i black out nearly every time i drink (even if it is just a once a week) and for three days after my obsessive compulsive disorder is in all bold caps neon-lit and cranked to the highest volume...when i drink my brain shuts off. so naturally when i start drinking i want to prolong the feeling as much as i can. it always ends in regret for me. i am a truly happier person sober...so why knowing this as a fact about myself do i break down nearly every weekend? a part of me blames everyone that says "you are overreacting/too hard on yourself/not an alcoholic." and in the right light i love to hear that from them and i believe it so that i can enjoy myself. but the adult in me knows those people are not to blame. i make the decision i hold the keys. ..if god forbid i had cancer and drinking made it worst or less likely to recover i probably would not drink. but despite the fact that drinking causes my mental health to suffer i continue to do it...i truly hope to collect enough time to feel comfortable not drinking with people. that is what i want but i honestly do not believe it is very possible. ..

What good can a therapist be if she/he doesn't know the truth about drinking to blackout drunk regularly?  I won't drink with you today.
