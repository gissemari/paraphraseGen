I'm over a month out since drinking alcohol.  I had been craving an ice cold beer in a mug.  Last night I drank a NA beer and it was good.  All I wanted was one!  No relapse tendency at all.  An recommendations on good NA beer?

Don't know where you live but I have found the Spanish/Catalan 0&amp;#37; beer Estrella Damm is very good and also the Heineken 0.0 is good. After that Beck's Blue and the Erdinger Alkoholfrei are OK.
I love my sparkling but I have been curious about NA beer. I'm so glad to hear you didn't relapse; I've been worried about that with the NA beer.

I like the Coors NA the best. I rarely see it though.
