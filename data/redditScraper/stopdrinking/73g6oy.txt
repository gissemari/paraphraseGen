Hey guys.I'm looking forward to a sober birthday tomorrow. I'm going out to get sushi with a couple friends. I'm nearing the 3 month mark. I'm definitely proud of myself but definitely still working on me and all the issues I have. I'm sensitive I hate being told what to do I'm anxious I'm weird I get depressed I struggle to communicate boundaries I'm too easy going I get too stressed out and I'm SOBER. I've been through hell from my drinking and I still carry my past around with me. But I have a lot to be thankful for. I look forward to more growth in my life as I turn away from the life I used to lead. I will not drink with you today or tomorrow on my birthday. Much love and keep truckin' SD.

Happy birthday! Almost three months is a HUGE accomplishment. Any plans to treat yourself? I am considering a new tattoo for myself.
