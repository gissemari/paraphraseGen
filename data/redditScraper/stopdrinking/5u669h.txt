I am constantly fighting to be sober so hard. Last time I made 5 months then I went back to drinking for a few more years. Somehow I've remained "functional" but drinking 12-26oz a night and more on weekends takes its toll I have really started to feel the effects. I have now been sober for a few weeks with a relapse on my birthday. I love being sober hate being drunk hate the hang overs. Damn addiction....... Gf isn't all that supportive she believes that I just need to drink beer only and will be ok. Suppose to move in with her having some serious doubts about that.... Of course there is so much more at this time I don't know... I just don't want to drink. ..Yes I know I need to reset days sober wish those really where my days but in place I have been busy poisoning myself.
