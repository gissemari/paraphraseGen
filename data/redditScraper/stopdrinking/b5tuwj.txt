Hey everyone. Just a quick one today. I'm back to Day 1 - two days ago I went on a full on binge and biked home through New Orleans (potholes drunk drivers and all) totally blacked out woke up with the usual curious scratches and bruises I couldn't remember acquiring. Yesterday I drank to taper off my shakes and anxiety. Today I'm clean and feeling a lot more stable. ..&amp;#x200B;..This is probably my 30th-ish day 1 since I realized I had a problem. I just recently started outpatient group therapy three times a week individual one-on-one therapy and attending AA meetings twice per week as well as taking Naltrexone. Putting these support systems in place one-by-one has been monumental in how I view relapses. Each one is now a learning experience rather than a reason to throw my hands in the air and say fuck it as us addicts like to do. If we can't be perfect at recovery we want to drink ourselves to death instead. That's not how any of this works. I would not know that without feedback from people with more sobriety under their belt therapists and doctors as my care team...&amp;#x200B;..Day 1 is not a failure. Day 1 is resilience. Day 1 is a brand new commitment to yourself a refusal to lay down and die to this disease...&amp;#x200B;..Whatever help you need no matter how many times you fall off go out there and get it. Build your care team. Utilize as many resources as you can. You deserve your love and attention and work. ..&amp;#x200B;..Peace.
