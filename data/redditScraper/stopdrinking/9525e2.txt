1 year 9 months ago. My second was born and I had been sober for a number of months. Boy I wanted to drink in those first few days. From stress anxiety nervousness tiredness. I was thinking about it and how much I missed and wished I could take a drink. I was never going to. Fully committed and never truly to the point of even considering a sip. But it was on my mind. Often...3 days ago we had our third. This is the first time thinking about alcohol. The only reason I am thinking about it is because of this subreddit since I've had a few moments to browse Reddit :)...Point is if your ever wondering if you'll ever not think about be tempted and struggle with alcohol maybe this will help you see the progression even during harder (although happy too!) times.

I also just want to mention I've gone through the first relapses where I thought I could moderate and now I know better. I'm not saying there's never moments where I long to drink with my family or friends but it is never something that makes me upset anymore.  I just wanted to demonstrate how much easier it's become and I hope new stop drinkers might be helped by this.
