So it's been a month. Not without its trials but overall the cravings haven't been terrible. Still the occasional attempt by my mind to tell me that I could handle a couple of beers here or there...I've read This Naked Mind over the last week and that is helping in keeping me on the right path...Physically I'm feeling better lost a few pounds and my clothes fit better...Mentally I'm getting some of the clarity back that I had before I relapsed. I'm back to working on myself again but this time there is an improved awareness with it. I think going through a relapse but being aware of it happening and of all of the ups and downs has really made things obvious for me...Life has a lot of challenges for me right now (financial kids relationship anxiety work) but they would be there regardless and even more strongly if i was drinking...Today I have a smile on my face and I am grateful for where i am at. I feel as though I can take on anything...Thank you all for being here and sharing your lives and struggles. It has really helped me understand that I am not alone in this and that I am good enough...Here's to another month :)..IWNDWYT!
