I'm devouring sweets in the afternoon in the evening when I get home on top of a chicken bacon sandwich. The struggle is brutal and I'm coping with calories today. It's not the healthiest option but better than poison!

My candy problem was thru the roof those first few weeks. Still eating more than I should but YES! It's way better than poison. 
I just bought two bags of dove chocolates and some martinelli's apple cider.
Better then booze.  At least the candy headaches only last for an hour of so.
The calories saved from not drinking ought to balance all that out.  A lot of folks here ate whatever they wanted the first couple of weeks and then sort of gradually worked on making healthier substitutions. Whatever get you through it!  I will not drink with you today.
All the time I spent counting how many beers I had. Now Im free from that. To heck with counting calories for awhile. I've still lost 10 pounds in 10 weeks. 
I've just lost 1.2kg in my first week despite a few binges. The only rule I set myself was no desserts and my psychologist amended it to mostly. You might surprise yourself when you calculate just how many calories you've cut out.
