I saw on Facebook yet another friend of mine got engaged I guess I'm at the age where that happens (32). But as happy as I am for them I always end up going down a shame spiral wondering what's wrong with me why I can't seem to meet anyone etc. I feel like it makes it doubly hard because I don't want to drink and I want to get my life together but I also worry about how I'll ever meet someone if I'm sober and staying at home every night. Obviously me dating right now is a terrible idea but it's something that has caused me to relapse before. Im just wondering if there are other single people out there and how do you deal with dating and or loneliness or comparing yourself to others?

You're definitely overthinking it. When I was dating I was surprised at how many people either weren't drinking or maybe had 1 drink with their meal and called it a night. It's just the age you're at and if that person thinks you not drinking is a deal breaker then trust me when I tell you that's not a person you want in your life.
