162 days in now.  Since quitting the scotch I have saved an estimated $10440.  For the first time I have money and don't worry at the end of the pay month.  I have paid off all debts and been able to buy myself and the wife some nice gifts.  I am now starting to save so I have a real rainy day fund for the first time ever...Here are my latest stats.....162 days sober..232 bottles of scotch not drunk (232 liters 61.29 gallons)..6728 standard drinks not drunk (21x daily recommended intake)..$10440 saved..38 days 16 hours time saved not drinking (only drinking not passed out time)..2264784 kilojoules 540934 calories..Stay strong everyone.  I have seen an increase in the relapse posts the last few days (or maybe I am imagining it) so hopefully this is an inspiring post to help everyone keep focused.

Really awesome!  What are you going to buy us?..Or... OK.  What are you going to buy for yourself?
Great stuff!  The numbers are impressive! Keep up the good work!
Jesus Christ on a popsicle stick.... That's a lot of booze and a lot of money saved! Congrats on your sobriety and congrats on surviving drinking! 
That's a really awesome way to break it down!
You are undertaking (just based on the numbers up there) a herculean task and you are freaking killing it. Well well done...Seriously man good job. Keep it up.
I was thinking about this today counting drinks not drank is more motivating to me than days. In 11 short days I have not put over 120 beers in my body. That's about 5 cases of beer. In over a week. ..I was going to Google a tracking calculator for this quitnet had one for smoking that was great.
540 934 calories?! Holy shit. I've never doing that shit ever again! lol...Seriously well done on those 162 days many more to come. Enjoy all of your new treats you can buy!
