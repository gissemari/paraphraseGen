I've been with this guy for 5 years....he's a great person and I love him very much. But sometimes he's not so great Any point we have almost broke up it has been because of him and alcohol. And every fucking time I forgive him. I've been consistently sober for 21 days and before my tiny relapse 60 days sober....he has not been which I don't expect of him either. But a day ago I woke up to him choking on his vomit and if I wasn't there he could have died. I just feel so done with this and for my sobriety I need to be....but it's so fucking hard to actually end it. I guess I'm just looking for strength in others if you have any advice or words of wisdom anything helps. With a heavy heart I thankyou all   I will not drink with you today.

Kudos for 21 days! I could not have stayed sober with a partner who abused alcohol. Protecting my sobriety was a priority. Since I wasn't sure how to do that I needed help. A therapist and AA meetings gave me the support and guidance I needed to stay sober. It sounds like you could use support. 
I was having issues with my SO when we lived together.  I finally decided to move out because (among other things) it was difficult to have alcohol in the house and be around her when she drank.  She often uses alcohol as a sleeping aid (as did I) and her mood is unpredictable on the weekends if she gets drunk.  I also got really tired of telling her it made me uncomfortable when she drives home from the bar buzzed...Our relationship actually got better after I moved out and she quit drinking for awhile.
