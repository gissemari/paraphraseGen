Last night I struggled. I could not rationalize the benefits of not drinking to myself. It was a bleak outlook that I could not conceive of a benefit to not drinking last night. In the I decided I would refrain from drinking for the benefit of my wife not for me. It wasn't a solid rationale but it worked. I also told myself I would only refrain for 24 hours. This I learned from this group. It really helped me last night...I slept soundly last night. I was wiped out..Today I woke up feeling great and am really f$&King happy I didn't drink last night. ..Here's to not drinking on day 5!

Whatever works!  The important thing is you put off drinking for those few hours.  I learned that here too.  I have learned a tremendous amount about myself and other people right here on SD.  I have spent countless hours reading and responding the last 46 days but I don't regret one damn second.  I am sober and happy.  Great job brutha.  Hang in there.
Congrats on that!  I bet your wife is glad to know you value her more than you value alcohol :)
