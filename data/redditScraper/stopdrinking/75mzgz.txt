Hi everyone..Five days later it will be 2 years for sobriety in my life. The first year it passed with some ups and down mostly down. However whenever I felt my mood down I reminded myself that even these ups and downs are due to my past drinking experience and drinking is going to be never a choice for me again. With this mindset there is no struggling no resistance. ..Even though deep depressive states I am able to cope with these moods with more healthy choices mindfulness walking and some exercise.  Last month I have been offered a high paid international job which would not be possible if I would perpetuate my filthy desperate states while drinking...I believe that if you just keep going on a little bit further leaving the addiction shores behind the more you become stronger against ups and downs. ..This sub also helped me a lot seeing that I am not alone in this journey. It is extremely important to have some sense of community seeing that you are not alone and no need to blame yourself or put down...
