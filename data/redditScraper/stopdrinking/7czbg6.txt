I just wanted to say thank you all for existing here. This community has helped me so much. I have been lurking here for a little over a month. I had 25 days under my belt before I had a previously scheduled girls weekend trip that I couldn't get out of without drinking. I know I could have. We all have choices. I chose not to. But I came back Sunday morning and was reminded why I quit in the first place. Nothing crazy happened. I just felt like shit and missed all the clarity I had before the relapse. So now here I am with a reset and ready to make it much longer than 25 days this time.

Welcome back!
It's a process! I didn't lurk here for long but I lurked inside myself for *years.* The first time I ever felt I had a problem I was 22. In 35 now. So a month in lurk mode is amazing if you ask me. ..I look forward to your updates!
