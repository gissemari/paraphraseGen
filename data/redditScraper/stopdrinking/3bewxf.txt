Bear in mind please that I'm trying really hard to not sound a massive prick. But this has been on my mind the last couple of days...I've been a steady on day a week binge drinker for a good long time. And its gotten to the point where I don't wake up a Sunday without having some regret. They range from mild i.e. I spent way too much money to medium i.e. Man I wish I hadn't've said that I owe him/her an apology. But I haven't hit the proverbial bottom...No DUIs never lost a job. I'm not in the bar everyday I've never been arrested. I don't think I'm alive only by the grace of God...But I do know I don't want one drink I want eight. If you string enough data points of drunk belligerence together you eventually have a trend. And I know if you roll the dice enough times eventually your luck will run out...So I've been to three meetings so far and I've gotten something out of each one. They've made me think and I did my first sober weekend in lord know's how long. And yesterday was really fucking difficult...But each time I'm there and I here people share terrible stories. And I sit there thinking "Wow that's awful." And I'm inspired by their ability to start climbing back out but I can't relate. I could see my drinking certainly leading to a horrible result but it hasn't yet...A gentleman caught up with me after a meeting and I'm truly glad he came up and said hello but when we spoke one-on-one I realized he'd hit a far deeper bottom than I had. As I tried to describe my struggles he didn't seem to understand. I distinctly remember him saying "Well you must have come here for some reason?" When I was finished. And bless his heart he was trying to help the new kid out but I felt like I left him with the impression that I was there on some court order or because I thought it was the hip thing to do or something to that effect...I guess the point of this long rambling post is to ask if anyone else has ever been to AA as more or less a preventative measure. An attempt to stop digging before you hit rock bottom...And how did you navigate I suppose trying to relate to others with whom you share a common addiction but an entirely different set of experiences related to it? I really think being in these rooms is a plus but it's been a bit of an awkward run for me.

I've met many people through the fellowship of AA that are in exactly your situation. The "bottom" is different for everyone and it does NOT have to be some awful thing where you've lost jobs houses or partners- a person's "bottom" is simply when they decide that the negatives of drinking outweigh whatever positives they think they're getting from alcohol. I promise you if you stick around you'll find plenty of people that you can relate to... and plenty of people that can relate to you!
I've never lost a relationship due to alcohol. I've never had a DUI. I've never had been reprimanded at work. Etc... Etc... ..I have let myself down so damn often. I have also started to see how my drinking was interfering with my ability to be my best self. I was starting to feel more and more embarrassed and like the drunk me was not living up to the standards I set for myself. Also I've realized as I drank more and more my ability to deal with big life issues got worse. I wanted to get ahead of that problem. ..I deleted my very first account on SD due to a somewhat dramatic relapse where I was convinced I could moderate to a few drinks. I wish I hadn't because you'd see me having a very similar thread as this. One thing that really stood out from that thread was that anyone with a DUI with a career hit with a lost relationship etc... Was at one point someone who just drank a lot but didn't have a DUI a career hit a lost relationship etc... This is almost defenitional. We're just stopping before the hump - there's really nothing fundamental that means we wouldn't end up with one of those experiences. ..So don't worry about not being at the "bottom" or not having a very bad experience short of just disappointment or embarrassment. As senor Crosby says bottom is where you stop digging. Your sobriety is yours the only thing that's important is that it is a positive thing for you.
