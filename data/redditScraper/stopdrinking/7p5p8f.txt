One of the best things I learned here is how to HALT when a craving hits. It stands for 4 major things that cause cravings- Hungry Angry Lonely Tired. So the whole point is to take care of whatever you actually need rather than to drink it away...I'm giving being sober another try. The physical symptoms subsided for me within the first few days but now my mind and emotions are beginning to sober up too. And I'm struggling tonight. I feel lonely. My friends work different schedules than I do and everyone is busy...I started thinking about going out to drink tonight. And then I HALTed. I'm not hungry or angry maybe a little tired but definitely lonely. And it's ok to feel that way. Drinking won't fix feeling lonely. I don't want a drink I want friends to hang out with tonight. And realizing the feeling/need behind the craving really puts it into perspective for me...I'm not drinking with you today.
