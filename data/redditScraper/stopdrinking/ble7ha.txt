Hi y'all! Just wanted to report that I've made it exactly one month sober today!..Some of the tough stuff I managed to accomplish/get through without the devil's juice in April:..1) Handling the fact my alcoholic ex spouse (who I'm still in love with) now has a girlfriend. Normally I would've went straight to drowning my emotions about something like this with enough wine to make Caesar slightly tipsy but this time around I analyzed my feelings congratulated him on the new relationship realized that as long as he was happy that I was happy even if he's not with me and instead of drinking I shared a huge chocolate milkshake with our kid...2) Mourned the one year anniversary of my alcoholic Dad's death with my family while drinking non alcoholic Busch (Busch was his favorite beer) and made a huge barbecue dinner for my family on his favorite grill...3) Got a job interview scheduled in a couple days that is very promising and will put my kid and me in a much better financial situation and will relocate us to an area with better educational opportunities for my kid and way more options for me to socialize that doesn't revolve around alcohol...4) Started therapy for dealing with a no joke traumatic past year and started meds to help with my depression and insomnia and am making lots of progress by leaps and bounds!..5) Remembered to send my Mom flowers on what would've been her and my Dad's 39th wedding anniversary and she gave me a big hug and cried with me a bit (holy crap those feelings)..6) Handling my son's "threenager" mood swings and attitude with way more patience than before..Anywho hoping this gives anyone here who might be struggling with their sobriety some motivation to stick with it. I'll raise a can of La Croix to all of you here on SD but one thing is for sure:..IWNDWYT
