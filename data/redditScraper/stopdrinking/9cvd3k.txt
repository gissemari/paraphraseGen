After years of struggling... I finally admitted to myself that I needed help and was willing to do anything it took to fight my disease. I went to AA every day and learned a lot about myself and others. It's not for everyone (and not for me right now either) but it did help save me. For that i'm eternally grateful...I'm so excited about the passion and happiness that has taken over my new existence. There will be ups and downs but I'll be free from the grips of alcohol to make the best decisions for myself and my family...I'm ready and eager to take on the world. Sober. I wish I could gift this feeling to the whole world...Thank you..BrendanEC
