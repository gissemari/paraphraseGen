Posting to see my badge! I'm so happy with my progress in not drinking. I'm in such a better place than I was 100 days ago it's unreal. Still struggling with feeling all of the feelings and working on mindfulness when I'm reaching for junk food now but at least it's not wine! Here's to staying sober another hundred days with a goal of moving from alcohol free to alcohol free and back on keto. ..SD you've helped me so much and you probably don't even know it. Thank you all for sharing your journeys. It has helped me so so much!
