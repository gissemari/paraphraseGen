A few days ago I was giving directions to a transit worker who was at my work for a banquet. He was dressed up shirt and tie. I noticed his small gold tie pin was a circle around a triangle.  I almost said nothing. As he was turning away I called after him "Hey I like your pin. AA?"..He nodded looking a little self-conscious..."How long?" I asked..."Coming up on 10 years" he said. .."Congrats!" I said. Pointing to myself "Six months."..He congratulated me saying six months is nothing to scoff at.  We parted ways. I don't even know what his name was.  But I wanted to share with all of you because sometimes we get so wrapped up in our own struggle and the slog of the day to day as addicts that we forget this could be the future for us too...We can do it SD. I won't drink with you today.

It almost feels a little like a secret club when you run into a member in public. There's an automatic sense of cocmoradery..
CONGRATS!!
Woot woot!
Congrats! :) Thanks for sharing. I will not drink with  you tonight.
