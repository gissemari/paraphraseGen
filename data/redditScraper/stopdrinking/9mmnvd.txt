Miracles do happen in sobriety. Sure not everything is rosy in the garden but I'm in a much better place since this time last year. Keep going if you're struggling with relapse I was in a stage of rinse and repeat for years. It's clich d but it does get better over time. ..I'm so proud of me for sticking it out. And you should be proud of you too.
