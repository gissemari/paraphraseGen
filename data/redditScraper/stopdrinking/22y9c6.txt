On May 25 2013 my family did the intervention.  My family and I don't talk much.  We have never had a good relationship.  But that day never have I felt so much love from my family.  I went to a 30 day facility and then a sober house for 30 days.  I came back home and saw a man die from his drinking when I was only 70(ish) days sober.  It was time to hang up my 22 year drinking career....I jumped head first into sobriety and have been working extremely hard at it.  Very hard.  Harder than anything I have done in my whole life....Everything had been going good until about a month ago I hit a dry drunk.  Things have been very out of wack since then.  My  fuck it mode  has been in overdrive and only now am I realizing the severity of my condition.  ...I just got back from a wedding that I was part of and I have known the family since I was 13.  There is no way to explain when where and how the choice to drink came into my head and only now am I beginning  to reflect on my behavior. How the hell did I not even think before I took that drink....I made out and did bad things with a stripper at the bachelor party.  I made out and did bad things with the event planner who is fucking married.  And now she's calling me telling me that she wants to see me. (Not good)  I made out with a 21 year old bridesmaid and we are texting now.   I almost got in a fight with a guest at the wedding because I was dancing with his wife.  I bitched slapped a groomsmen and told him to stop drinking.  I passed out in the back of a truck at the hotel that wasn't mine.  All of this in 72 hours.  I barely remember any of it and my head is still foggy....Everyone at the wedding loved me but those who really know me said that they are worried about me.  Some of them cried.  Grown men hugging me telling me they loved me with tears in their eyes and asking me what the hell am I doing?  And I don't have an answer.  I don't know what the fuck I am doing....The crazy part is that I know what I did was outrageous.  I know that I should feel a tremendous amount of emotions ..but I just don't.  And I am really scared.  How can I hurt so many people that love me and gave me one last shot to be a part of their lives and there are no emotions?  Why don't I care?  Why am I not capable of seeing what I am doing?  I know what the right thing to do is but I don't feel anything.  I just don't understand.  ...Today I found out that my father needs to see the doctor and we had  the talk .  He might be dying.  My mother wrote me a hand written letter stating that she loves me and wants to be a part of my life.  First one I have gotten from her in over 15 years.  My dog hurt her paw and needs medical attention.  I have deadlines for my business tomorrow.  I haven't paid taxes yet....And all I want to do is go have "another good time".  The monkey is on my back again.  ..It's not a fucking game.  It's not as simple as you think it is.  If you are a first timer here reading posts trying to figure out if you have a drinking problem.  You do.  Living life is much simpler better and more rewarding with a clear head and conscious.  You don't have to drink but there comes a time where an invisible line is passed and then you have to drink.  And that's when you're fucked.  Some people can do it.  But there is certain portion of the population that has something wrong with their brains and there is no shut off switch when pleasure is consumed.  You want more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more.  I am a part of that population.  There is no end to it and there is no satisfaction.  I want more and I want it now....Best part about my obsession (sarcasm) .....  Is that It doesn't go away. If I don't do something about it I am going to end up dead.  And I'm not ready die.  ..Day fucking 1.  What's up..

Wow raw stories like this give me hope I can one day quit forever. ..I've been battling the idea of quitting for several years. I've drank insane amounts ever since I came back from my first deployment to Afghanistan in 2004. But I just can never stop because I really don't want to even though it's so obvious I should...It's so ironic but it seems like to me that the more harm I do to those I care about the more I want to drink after even when drinking caused it. ..The cycles never seems to end and I keep hoping I can eventually be a functioning alcoholic like some kind of fairy tale for someone who absolutely loves liquor. 
Hit an SAA meeting after your AA meeting. That's the best shot if you don't want to die.
I don't know what to say to help except maybe one thing.  You need to make some amends as quickly as possible.  Don't use your drinking as an excuse but I think it's ok to let people know you're an alcoholic in recovery.  If you're busy taking care of the shit you created it makes it harder to focus on the compulsion to drink because you're right...it's not a fucking game.  I love you and wish you the best.  
The past is in the past what you can change now is the future.  And it is fucking awesome that you are starting now...Alcohol is rough on your emotions and the days coming up will be difficult both physically and emotionally.  Be sure to see a doctor if possible to help you through this as you know it can be dangerous...Credibility is built back slowly and amends take a while.  You tried an experiment to see if you could still drink...and you have the results.  Congrats on taking the right step we're here for you!
**Come back now.**.. It will get way worse too quickly.   The good will will evaporate  and shit will happen
You could look at it this way. . .Or you could get back on track and two months from now be saying "I've only drank # in the past year."
Welcome back and I'm glad you made it my friend. Please stay with us this time around k?..Thank you so much for sharing this:..&gt;But there is certain portion of the population that has something wrong with their brains and there is no shut off switch when pleasure is consumed. You want more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more. I am a part of that population. There is no end to it and there is no satisfaction. I want more and I want it now...I completely agree that when I put things into my body that are sometimes called "pleasurable" I have no off switch. Reading your description of it brought me back to that feeling and I am physically nauseous thinking about. Doing things that I know I should not be doing and feeling like I have no control over my mind and body in order to stop. Fortunately all I have to do is not take that first drink to never feel that horrible way again. ..Also fortunately there are other things that are pleasurable in this life that don't involve doing that to myself...all it takes is getting out there and finding them. Things that nourish my inner self instead of starve it.  ..I wish you well brother and I hope if you chose to reconnect with your family that it helps you reconnect with that place within yourself where the YOU you're looking for is waiting to join with you again. ..&lt;3 ..
Welcome back /u/sober-in-texas.  All the good advice is already in the thread plus you know what to do: stop drinking and grow the f#ck up.  It's hard work but you can do it.

Thanks for sharing. It helped put my personal situation in context. These thoughts came out me after reading your story...    psychosis..    feeling those feelings rise up again.    feeling like we are using it.    when it in fact is using us.    people on the outside wondering ..    what happened..    we don't see it.    we only see ourselves.    but not our real self.    the self that it wants us to see..    a false reflection.    a sense of power and contentment.    a lie we believe.    because we can't bear the truth..    we're weak..    even at our strongest.    when we are holding back the walls of relapse.    even at our most grateful.    when we see true beauty in the world.    even at our most trusting.    when we know that everything is going to be OK..    even at those times.    especially at those times..    we are vulnerable..    one act of self-sabotage.    and we are down for the count..    it's only a matter of time..    but time is on our side.    24 hours 48 hours.    3 days 7 days 10 days.    2 weeks 3 weeks.    1 month 3 months 6 months..    start over again.    24 hours 48 hours ..    it's an upward spiral..    we may be at the same place we were before.    but we're not the same people we were before.    we've grown.    we've learned.    we are better prepared for the struggle..    everyone's got their own set of tropes in life.    this struggle with addiction is one of ours..    we have a choice.    we've been down that road.    we know exactly where it ends.    and that's not where we want to be..    so we get up.    we move on.    we continue the struggle..    no guilt.    no judgement.    just doing what we know we have to do..    it's not a zero-sum all-or-nothing game.    it's not how many consecutive days we can string together.    it's about how many times we've said "no".    when the vocal majority inside of us is screaming.    YES! DO IT! NOW!..    cravings are emotions.    fear is an emotion.    guilt is an emotion..    emotions pass.    we remain..    for we are more.    we are stronger.    we are alive..    as long as we have the will to choose.    we can choose to be free..**It's simple but it ain't easy: just. don't. drink.**
Keep this.  It will help you...I have a journal from my last year of drinking. Being able to remind myself of the reality of what drinking is like for me has been invaluable...
Not too encourage your behavior but.....at least you got some action with all these women. Every time i drank i was just absolute pathetic and tragic...Going to meetings everyday is whats been keeping me thinking right. I just wish i had more purpose in my daily life. ..Thanks for the sharing
A lot of what folks are saying on here you have already read and registered into your brain if what you responded is the truth...Brother I have been there. I have been where you are at day 1 and picking up after the carnage. I get the numb. I get the fuck it but accept the consequences attitude. Been there am still there on bad days...First don't. Drink. Give yourself some head space. As much as you need. Go to work/school/adult responsibilities and go home..Second don't. Drink. Go to a meeting (AA/SMART/Church/choose your flavor). And talk it out with folks who don't come with strings attached. You can talk on here. I have you pinged so hopefully I will see any new posts from you..Finally don't. Drink. Make amends. But be smart about it. Don't make it a drama. It took me the better part of a month to get individuals to meet at a public cafe just the two of us and informing the other person. They will never ever speak to me again. Call it a life tax. I am still paying. You will be too. But it gets better. You will get through this..I like the idea of keeping a record of this. Please do. I wish I did.
I'm sorry it may sound silly but what's "SAA"?
Thank you for posting this.  I am deathly afraid of something like this happening and reading your post reminds me of how fragile we are.  It's a daily battle...Can I ask if you were in AA or a daily recovery program?  Did you have support after rehab?  Just asking as some of us are coasting and doing it 'on our own' and some of us are going to AA.  Did you have something like this or were you coasting and staying dry?..Something that you wrote reminded me of the way I felt when I was drinking heavily 'I just don't care' and I didn't feel anything either.  But the reason why I didn't care was because I didn't like myself too much and I thought I was a bit of a lost cause.  I also thought my family wouldn't miss me much if I drank myself away.  It sucks to feel that way.  Alcohol feeds those kind of thoughts though...Thanks for taking the time to write this.  I hope you'll get back on the horse. You made it farther than I have and you deserve props for that.
All the best buddy I hope you can see your way through this difficult time. Stay strong.

There's no respect greater than that I have for someone who can admit their faults and return to the program after a relapse. I'm an alcoholic..it's not easy to just break the cycle. The only thing that separates the dead alcoholic to the recovering one is the tenacity required to pick yourself back up after a slip (regardless of it being big or small) and take action to stay clean and live a full life without drugs/alcohol. Mad respect to you my friend for telling on yourself for relapsing thus gaining power over it. Keep on trucking.
I am at a pretty bad place as well.  I am just starting to realize i definitely have a problem and i need to fix it before it gets any worse.  I am so glad that i read your post because you are too fucking right.  Its not worth hurting the people you love the most.  day fucking 2 right here.  how you doing.
I just wanted to chime in and thank you for your raw and very honest post.  You can spend a lifetime hating yourself for what happened when you slipped up.  But just like taking a drink it's not worth it.
