That dream where you decide that having just one will be okay and you drink. The drink never ends up being worth it in the dream - only brings devastation. After waking up I question if it really happened and look for my SD friends. ..Day 66. The 60s have been hard for whatever reason...pink clouds are gone sober skills have been tested and retested in multiple situations and that little voice lurks in the background  just one would be ok - everybody else can do it  .(Maybe that's where the drinking dreams come from)...Posting to share the struggle and to renew collective strength in this journey...IWNDWYT   ..
