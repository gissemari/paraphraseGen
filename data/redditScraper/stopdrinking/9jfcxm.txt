I cold turkey-ed last month ..... and I got sick like really sick fever for a day colds and tonsillitis. Maybe it wasnt all from the alcohol. Days before I quit cold turkey I walked into rain ate SHIT foods like fastfood and sweets. Days before I quit my tonsils were itchy and inflamed a bit..I relapsed.....And I started to taper yesterday drank only one beer. And today when I reached after 24 hours my hands didnt shake but they were a bit hot and numb. So I drank one shot of vodka (45ml) and mixed wt soda. I dont know if it was psychological but my hands got better. Anxiety too maybe. So im planning to do the same tomorrow just a beer. For 5 days straight and then start reducing it by half for another 5 days.....Any tips and stories would be appreciated..Thank you

The only thing that any one of us can do is to tell you to see a doctor. We have strict rule against seeking tapering advice on this site because withdrawal can be dangerous even deadly and should be supervised by a doctor. We have removed your post and hope you'll seek medical support.
Its all cleared now. THANK YOU SO MUCH. Im seeing a doctor tomorrow specialising in alcohol. God bless
