I'll reset my badge...Thanks to you guys I've done sober stretches since late April that once felt impossible...By taking it one hour at a time I made it 96 hours then a week (when my goal was a month) and now six days...That week seemed harder than the six days. I think it's because at the beginning of the week I felt shitty. And no wonder! I was just eating junk and going on Reddit. This time I felt more productive. I made a little money on the side. I found that staying busy helped my cravings. In fact I caved when I was lollygagging on Reddit...I don't feel as bad about falling off the wagon this time as opposed to after a week. Last time it was "welp I've had one beer - might as well have nine more." A couple of weeks passed and I'd drink any number of drinks from zero to one to four to fifteen. That last fifteen was on the last day. I think subconciously I thought  "I'll make you feel so bad that you'll want to stop." I never drink fifteen but I did then...I still drank too much when I caved this time - four drinks - but I'm not going to do a fifteen-drink day to get back on the wagon. ..I also realized I like escapism. Staying sober was easier when I could escape into an episode of Black Mirror.  My plan for tomorrow includes a book Ready Player One to read in the evening. I hear it's similar to Black Mirror. I also plan to do schoolwork and look for a part time job...Oh yeah: And I learned that drinking alcohol was more sucky than I remember it. Sneaking around wanting more etc. When I had my cocktail playlist stuck in my head I didn't really want a drink: I wanted to listen to the music...What they say about relapsing in your head first is true. I think my brain wanted to buy wine all along. ..I turn 22 next month and I think a good birthday present would be to have some sober time under my belt. My birthday is in 41 days. My first mini-goal is ten days then fifteen days then twenty-one days. I think I'll be setting myself up for a good 22nd year. But of course the first ten doesn't come without the first day. I've found that taking it one day at a time and then letting the days add up is easier than setting a goal only to fall short so I'm a little nervous about setting my milestones...(Can I also get some advice for starting to look for a part-time job? )

Thanks for posting this. It was a good reminder. Thanks for doing the research  .Yes I find the  just worry about today  thing really helpful too.
Hi Rachie.Glad to hear you're improving I'm rooting for you over here!  Sending good vibes your way       ..What kind of part time job appeals to you?  When I was looking for one I focused on my hours of availability and how much effort I felt like going to how much I wanted to earn then decided the best sorts of jobs to apply for after that fit in those categories.  .
