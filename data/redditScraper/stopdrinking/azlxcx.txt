Y'all first off so glad I found this. I haven't had anyone who gets what I'm working through in not drinking anymore. Secondly I feel dumb posting this but I'm a trained social worker with no knowledge of alcohol recovery beyond the basics. I've worked in healthcare but not substance abuse (outside of referring people to programs). And anyway those days are past as I work in IT now. ..Here's the deal I cannot seem to make it past the seven day mark without relapsing. The days before that I am tempted. But at seven days I almost can't stop myself. Is there a book or website you would recommend for research? My google searches are turning up blog posts on the stages of change (which I already) know. But nothing on what my body/brain are working with as I progress through those first few days.

Alcohol Explained by William Porter is my Bible. Helped me understand so much including why I drank like I did. ..This sub also really likes "This Naked Mind" by Annie Grace. It's a good one helps you to reframe some misconceptions and attitudes we develop towards alcohol...Those two books helped me take a big step towards feeling free from alcohol rather than deprived of it. Alcohol Explained is the one that blew me away completely.
Rachel Hart has a podcast called "taking a break" and website. I enjoy her teaching.  
Ill download some episodes of that one too. It helps to have a few to try and see what works better for me. Thanks so very much!
