Day 18. Doing better than I expected to be honest. Taking it one day at a time. I'm going to my therapist and group counseling sessions doing my homework staying in touch with friends etc. I still feel very scared for another relapse but maybe thats a good thing. Slowly moving forward I don't want to go back anymore. Greetings from Europe I will not drink with you today.

Great!..Are there any Alcoholics Anonymous meetings near you?..I got sober in AA and I've met a lot of sober tourists over the years.  
Good for you. IWNDWYT
