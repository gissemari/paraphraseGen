Sober On!
If my head reaches a sober pillow  tonight I won. 
Kinda funny to me you say it that way - it's a mind trick I do in the gym sometimes (only 9 more times of doing that 1 thing) but had not yet applied it to my streak.  Thanks for the insight!
That is an interesting trick. Separate your concept of a 'sober interval' into 30 day chunks instead of single days. Then put it on repeat. I like it! I think I'll try it :).
That's kinda how I'm thinking of it. Instead of thinking "I'm never drinking again for the rest of my life" my goal is to make it to 30 days then challenge myself to another week then another week then the rest of that month and so on. Split it into bite-size chunks along a continuous timeline instead of one giant daunting task.
When I hit 250 recently I thought "now I just do this 3 more times and I'll have 1000 days!" 
Yes! Absolutely!..But it may take just as much work too :))
Oh I like this! 
Easier than that just do today ! 
I just reached 32 days- started a bit before sober October &amp; gearing fit head in to November. It's hard- just have to keep going...
I see if I can go 1 day I can do it once more...1 day at a time has stood by me for over 28 years. ..But what works works. I am just saying how I do it.
