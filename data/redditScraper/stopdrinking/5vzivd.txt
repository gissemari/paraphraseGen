I have been a mess of ups and downs over the past several months (year to be truthful) with regards to drinking. I'd go through a bad bender and come out on the other side relatively unscathed except for feeling like shit for a while. Attempted to go at not drinking again only to run into a wall of raw emotions and self-medicate yet again...I'm beginning to wonder if I can ever make it. Such a failure the longest time sober I've gone is 60 days and that was over a year ago. Here I am again facing Friday night and contemplating how nice it would be to have some whiskey and let go of all the stress from the work week/life in general for a little while...I want to scream. The truth is I actually want to feel that release but I know it is killing me and thus need to stop. I guess I've not truly committed to stop drinking all the other times...Hoping I can tough it out but I'm scared. I've had these tools at my disposal (this forum "This Naked Mind" book Alan Carr's book etc.) and still going through the cycles. Part of my mind wants to throw in the towel...I've set up appointments again with a therapist but that's not until late next week. Work has gotten to be such a trigger for me that sometimes I drink just to celebrate making it another day. I'm trapped in this one-dimensional life and see no opening for escape and that makes me also want to say screw it...Sorry for the rant I just really needed to put this all out somewhere. Here's hoping for a weekend "free".

I'm sorry you're struggling. That shit is no fun. I will say that for me 60 days was not enough for me to enjoy sobriety. I was still **really** pissed off. It seems like a long ass road but around 3 months was when I finally started feeling the freedom. I think many people give up a bit too early. I know it's hard and it sucks and it feels like it will never improve... but if you can hold it will improve vastly. ..Patience. It takes a *lot* of patience. I won't drink with you.
