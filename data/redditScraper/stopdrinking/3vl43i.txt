I got busy and forgot to post on my 1 year of sobriety.  It's been a struggle for sure but this sub has been a huge help!  I haven't gone to AA or anything but I'm looking into local support groups.  The biggest problem I've had is realizing most of my friends were drinking buddies and I'm having to relearn how to be social without drinking.  The past year has been a rollercoaster for sure.  I went through the initial "honeymoon" phase where everything was bright and amazing. Then as the months passed I realized that even though I wasn't drinking the problems that made me want to drink were still there.    I still have a lot of work to do facing my issues and dealing with them but I feel like I have the clarity to begin really recovering.  I really appreciate all the support I've gotten from this sub It's given me faith in humanity!  Cheers!

         I realized that even though I wasn't drinking the problems that made me want to drink were still there. ..I only have 50 daysbut can see this coming back to me...how do we get beyond those problems?..Like today grown up step son totally ignored my wife's plans it seems like he came when he wanted and left as soon as he could.. Not going to drink over it but certainly upset more for my wife who did so much planning and work for the event. There are other things I can look back on in these last 50 days that are "problems" but my resolve to not drink this group daily check in and Allen Carr are still keeping me good.
Congratulations!
