My car has been in the shop getting fixed so nothing much to do as I'm out of work. I would of definitely took this time to drink the day away before. Tonight I have to take a bus to a class it will be a struggle on the way back not to stop off at a bar or to go to a liquor store. I don't want to spend the day or night drinking.

Life is mostly boring for the majority (my opinion)-but we sure fight to keep it-so it ain't so bad I guess.
Find the little joys.  Yogurt flavors seltzer water sports trees the warm breezes...notice the good stuff and the boredom and cravings fade..
Good idea
[Here are a few ideas!.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/bored)
Download some audio books or podcasts to listen to on your bus ride buy a sketch book/pencils. Maybe there is an organization you can volunteer for? Donating that free time is an easy to make yourself feel useful while helping others. ..Volunteering also looks good on your resume. Pets also help! Start with a plant :) 
Having a lot of fun with Udemy courses on drawing and programming myself. Check it out they have tons of classes and they're all about $15 or less with coupons.
Then don't !
