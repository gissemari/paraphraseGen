It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-----------------------------------------..**Struggle:** Like many other artists I sometimes question whether or not I actually have any talent. I was given a grant from an arts council in upstate New York earlier in the year and so I had been feeling more confident but recently a family member a professional artist whom I admire and who has sold her work for years told me that my work is  dilettantish. ..**Triumph:** Comments like these still hurt my feelings but I am no longer completely derailed by them. In sobriety my emotions (even the bad ones) have become manageable and so I have been able to keep working on my collages regardless of what was said about them...**General:** I have a new phrase that I use to diffuse a tense or difficult situation:  Maybe you're right.  People calm down when they hear this even though in truth the phrase has no meaning. Maybe you're right maybe you're wrong maybe I'm right maybe I'm wrong maybe the earth is flat maybe donkeys love applied mathematics it all means the same thing which (because of the word  maybe ) is actually nothing at all. But I have found that it is effective in making people feel that they have won a point and then the conversation can move on. ..
----------immediate responses--------

I like the phrase; can I borrow it to use with my  know it all' control freak boss?! Good for you &amp; good luck!
**Struggle:** After being diagnosed with PTSD about six months ago (on top of MDD social anxiety GAD and panic disorder!) and learning about it/how to manage it with my therapist I am dealing with being triggered at work by someone who is basically using gaslighting to get away with underhanded crap countless times now. It's a challenge to say the least but I'm grateful I work with many other great people have strengthened my relationships with my friends (and cats!) and have learned healthy ways of coping since stopping drinking...**Triumph:** I met with my state rep today at the state house..! I'm still a bit surprised I did it tbh (chickened out before due to anxiety). It was to promote this Treatment Not Imprisonment bill to help people with addiction. While I didn't share my own story I stressed the importance of treatment and caring for those with substance issues and it was pretty cool. ..**General:** I've been drawing writing and being so much more creative lately. After leaving an abusive relationship three years ago and stopping drinking 219 days ago I just feel more and more like myself everyday and it's just so nice- and like I'm moving closer to doing what I really want to do with my life.
What an art snob! Glad to hear you're able to not let it get to you and still do your art. I feel like in that situation a "Maybe you're wrong" would've been a good response heh. Unless it's constructive criticism how rude! High five for art and not drinking! 
Dear u/sfgirlmary..The voices inside my head took a vote. The consensus is that you do indeed have talent. In fact that little imp I like to call Eve took a particular interest in the collage of the apple you created. ..Carry on. IWNDWYT 
I also thought your apple collage was gorgeous sfgirlmary so maybe the criticism came from insecurity? Glad you are out there creating!.Struggle: I live in a coastal city and bike commute to save $ and avoid traffic. Because of the ocean I have a headwind both riding in to work and riding home. Today it was really strong and I was already feeling tired. This felt like a metaphor for staying sober some days- everything pushing me one direction but me pushing back even harder towards the other direction..Triumph: Still sober able-bodied and have a job to commute to. Badge seems to be working again!! Thanks Mods!!.General: I am feeling moody this week! 
I'm so sorry that your work was dismissed like that and by someone you admire! I know how demeaning it is. The thing that sucks about this kind of comment (IMO) is that it's not a critique about one piece that is unrelatable to an individual or about some tangible attribute like color or balance or whatever but a total attack on the artist the process or the essence. It's a comment that doesn't spark conversation or exchange at all. It's just a blunt hammer BAM. I think the viewer must be a bit obtuse. I've only seen two or maybe three pieces of your work but the collages had a way of seeming a bit surreal like a snapshot of a dream of someplace very familiar but distinctly different in a way hard to pinpoint. And for me that concept itself is provoking. I mean I guess the "success" of art from the viewer's perspective is totally different from person to person. What should it make you experience? I used to argue with my aunt about political cartoons which she claimed were not art and I totally adamantly disagreed with her verdict. ..Anyway.....**Struggle:** Anxiety. Maybe it's because I've been reintroducing caffeine into my reality. Maybe it's everything...**Triumph:** Finished my internship hours necessary for my career to move forward. Yay!..**General:** OMG **maybe** you're a genius. I love that trick. Totally stealing that one. ..&amp;#x200B;
**Struggle:** A man from my city went through my profile after I posted on the local subreddit and decided to send me a long patronizing email about how I'm "dealing with my demons" so well and how he needs a buddy and an "ear to vent to". Er no thanks. My default is usually kindness and warmth for people who reach out/make themselves vulnerable in some way. If I had been drinking I'd have just gone for it tried to make friends probably tried to sleep with him at some point then regret it. Ugh. But unwelcome advances from men even if it is just "friendship" and especially in my context where creepy men abound (where don't they!) and *especially* a sort of overly-familiar tone because he's read my post history are super super upsetting. He was super polite about it whatever but I'm sick of men feeling entitled to my time or attention just because he's lonely/new to the city/whatever. If he'd even just tried to say hi/strike up a conversation based on mutual interests rather than telling me that someone in his family had debt and alcohol issues it would've been more appropriate. I'm sick of teaching basic online etiquette and politeness to 20-something dudes especially after the gigantic MeToo movement in India really did contribute to something of a cultural shift against entitled/creepy dudebro behaviour. (Phew sorry thanks for listening). Also I still haven't been paid from that client for over a month. Argh...**Triumph**: Many tiny revolutions. Working on editing the story for publication without much shame or anxiety. Treating work as "training" like I'm a work athlete and just showing up everyday. A niggling femur strain seems to have lifted after a day or two of rest. Cutting down on the excess caffeine and my body seems to be thanking me for it. It's mango season!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ..**General**: "If you are drinking too much if you are lost in your life and afraid to articulate even to yourself how unhappy you are how fearful of the future of death of other people of being poor of not being good enough sexy enough thin enough tough enough famous enough if you feel that you are not enough and that if you could only  X Y Z then everything would be fine' I believe you are on the spectrum of addiction."..&amp;#x200B;
Hey u/sfgirlmary .  Don't let that comment get you down!  I have a job where I have to create.  It's tough to put your work out there and negative comments can hurt I know. These words help me:.."It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat." - Teddy Roosevelt ..Brene Brown referenced this quote in her book Daring Greatly.  She writes  Vulnerability is the birthplace of love belonging joy courage empathy and creativity. It is the source of hope empathy accountability and authenticity. If we want greater clarity in our purpose or deeper and more meaningful spiritual lives vulnerability is the path.   ..It's not easy being vulnerable but so much good in life starts there.  I am proud of you for daring greatly with your art! IWNDWYT
/u/sfgirlmary I totally agree about the power of "maybe"!!! possibly my most useful tantrum-defusing word with Kiddo! and with my own inner teenager come to think of it. And glad you have the self-belief to keep going with your beautiful art - adding beauty to the world is such an important thing to be doing xx...*triumph* : my first TWO university assignments have been completed and submitted AHEAD of their drop-dead deadline. and despite the idea of celebrating with a glass of wine passing across my brain I didn't Tonight I will celebrate by reading a novel and not working late on the computer!..*struggle* turns out I still need to work on "how to celebrate stuff" without a glass [as in a whole bottle in a glass] of wine being part of the equation. Extra cheese is currently not enough... so have to give that some thought...*general* still love the late arvo/early evening endless sparkly water with a squeeze of lime or lemon. No idea why it's so darn enjoyable but it just is! I also appear to be getting quite the coffee habit though with uni and all the late nights and added driving involved. Not sure if I want to decide coffee is a problem. Maybe I'm just so used to looking at things trying to find the problem?...
"Maybe you're right" - thats a great conflict defuser I'm going to use that. Happy hump day/! IWNDWYT
I'm on day seven and yesterday was really hard. I cried while waiting for my sons bus but I didn't drink. Here's to another day! 
**Struggle:** Keep having nightmares where I get drunk and ruin my life. I wake up in the biggest panic and check everything is okay even though I haven't been near alcohol. Also I was kind of hoping my skin would be GLOWING by now haha everybody who stops drinking goes on about a glow. I look the same...**Triumph:** The coming Monday I will be 6 months sober. I posted at 2 months that my wife was pregnant and I never planned to drink again and I'm proud to say I've kept my word...**General:** Been doing so much DIY lately think my wife is amazed at how much I've been able to get done without drink in my life. Booked a couple of days off work and going to get stuck into some video-games maybe read a book and give myself a much needed break. 
Happy Wednesday! "Dilettantish?" Geez being rude with a pretentious word even. My phrase this year to shut down people who are being rude to me is "thank you for the feedback". Similar to yours in that it doesn't really concede a point and it doesn't mean I'm going to change anything either but it tends to end an unpleasant encounter. ..**Struggle:** Never enough time in a day to get everything done at work. People who were going to help me with stuff flake on me. I have to stop believing that our agents are going to come in and do extra work out of the goodness of their hearts. When they say they are I have to just nod and smile and continue to plan to do the work myself...**Triumph:** Loving bundling up each morning and getting a walk in with my dog and BF is even going with us most days. It's amazing what a little fresh air each day can do for your mood...**General** Supposed to hit 50 degrees here today! Love it!
Please don't listen to your family member.  I know it stinks to be told something like that by someone you admire but she's still just one person who's opinion doesn't really matter.  You got a grant for heaven's sake.  That's tangible that's affirming that's something you can take to the bank.  ..I'm a singer and I've heard discouraging comments as well.  You put it in your back pocket and keep going.  I remind myself of this thing I heard about Meryl Streep.  I had to go and find it for you.  Basically she was struggling to get her career going and was told by a director that she was "too ugly" for a particular part.  But queenie has won a bunch of Oscars since then so f-ck that guy.  ...[https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3313978/Throwback-photo-Meryl-Streep-32-unlikely-viral-hit-shared-fan-page-inspiring-message-overcame-sexism-Hollywood.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3313978/Throwback-photo-Meryl-Streep-32-unlikely-viral-hit-shared-fan-page-inspiring-message-overcame-sexism-Hollywood.html)
**Struggle:** My skin has been getting worse and worse the last 6 months even though I'm almost 90 days sober. I was hoping that alcohol was a contributor to the adult acne but turns out its completely hormonal. I saw the doctor yesterday and I'm going to get a dermatologist referral likely for accutane which requires no drinking. That won't be a problem now at least before it would make me put off the treatment! Also I have runners knee which is quite painful hoping it eases up soon as running has easily replaced drinking as my favourite hobby...**Triumph:** Speaking of running I ran the furthest I've ever managed before on Sunday 11k! It was tough but not impossible. I even had enough energy to bake a big cake afterwards. Felt good...**General:** Not even missing alcohol. Thinking about my formerly favourite drinks (especially the really *special* ones like fancy cocktails at nice bars) is just like looking at pictures of giant ridiculous food on instagram - the thought is tasty but I'm not in any way craving it or struggling with going without. If anything I miss the flavour as opposed to the alcohol itself - if I could get something that tasted exactly the same but was 0% I'd be all over it like a rash. This was only ever meant to be a temporary thing but I'm thinking at this rate it may end up being a forever thing. I like myself more like this.
I have the same general feeling that I am going to miss some flavors of things I like to drink. I'm trying to envision I will not miss them because they are lies. They taste good but they make me feel bad later I always have a wave of sadness the next day. Also I cleared up my acne using r/skincareaddiction getting accutane is the best bet but they have info to help with the side affects like dryness etc...Congrats on sober living!
Family can be the most toxic influences in our lives and friends too.  I've learned to identify people that should be my cheerleaders that are actually out to get me.  ..I think that she may be threatened and jealous.  I think the comment is/was meant to bring you down.  I thought the apple was awesome.  And I actually saved an image of one of your collages.  And I don't have any other art pics on my computer...**S:**  My landlord is selling the house.  The agent wants me to be home when there are showings because of the dogs.  ..**T:**  Survived my first three days of work.  ..**G:**  I turned my phone off at night the last two nights.  Ahh.  
&gt; a professional artist whom I admire and who has sold her work for years told me that my work was  dilettantish.  ..&amp;#x200B;..If they had an iota of decent judgement they'd have the judgement to use better phrasing to more effectively get their point across.  The word itself "dilettantish" really says more about the person uttering it than the work it's in reference to.  The implication that they can see a work from the angle of all 7 billion + people on earth and have decided there is no deeper meaning to it isn't only ignorantly arrogant but worse shows how little the understand about viewing a piece of art from outside their little realm.  There's nothing wrong with criticizing a piece there's nothing wrong with not "getting" a piece.  There is a serious issue when somebody says there's nothing to get about a piece.  How many works are expressions of personal stories and feelings that nobody who hasn't experienced similar things would even know to look for?..&amp;#x200B;..I'm not saying your work is good or bad nor anything about their work.  But their judgement should be considered less important than that of a toddler.  At least the latter doesn't have any predispositions...&amp;#x200B;.."Maybe you're right" is a brilliant way to move on with life.
Hello all! So I don't know if I'm an alcoholic. I have a very addictive personality in everything. If I enjoy a fast food burgers I'll get the same one every day for a week and then drop it. I listen to any song I like until I'm sick of it. Etc. So I definitely am addicted to nicotine. I used to smoke cigarettes now I vape. I've been vaping for years and still at a high level of nicotine - I just love it. No desire to cut back or quit that. But with booze it's been different. I just got sick of it. Typically I would drink alone after work. I'd have 6-12 beer in that time. Less often say on weekends or holidays I sometimes would start in the late morning and probably get through 18 or even more. I'd say on average I probably drank for sure every third day. I go to bed early by the way often before 10 - so I was downing beer FAST. It had some impact on my life (there were definitely a few days I could have done something else with friends but wanted to just drink at home and relax while gaming or whatever instead). But for the most part I was still at work every day still present for social gatherings sober or otherwise etc. If I am an alcoholic definitely high functioning. So I haven't had a drink in about a month (I'm on a weight loss kick at the minute). I love everything about it - not having to worry about how to get a ride home from frequent board game nights with friends etc. I'm looking better feeling better all of that. And I haven't had a craving for booze. If I'm an addict in that regard it's not the same type of addiction as with nicotine. I can take or leave the booze without any real investment of will power. The only thing that gives me pause is I really enjoyed a social drink and I find myself thinking - really? NEVER again? Not at my friend's wedding in September? Not when my craft beer taste-testing buddy visits this summer? I don't think I can safely be a social drinker because as I said I have a very addictive personality. I had a cinnamon bun last week I really loved and I ate four more that same day. I imagine if I allow myself a drink it'll end up being a week-long bender with breaks only for work. I'm just wondering is this familiar to anyone? Is it an addiction to booze or something else? It just seems a bit overwhelming to commit for life to not drinking anymore. Even though I don't miss that anxiety and lethargy waking up not feeling my best or dreading who I texted. Any insights more than welcome! Thanks!
Struggle: Fixing my marriage after alcohol helped me down a path of self-destruction. We are making progress but it will take time...Triumph: I'm 10 days sober and not absolutely miserable anymore. I get my antidepressants tomorrow...General: I've realized i really need to make new friends. I'm hoping to explore hobbies when i move in a month and make friendships that dont just revolve around alcohol.
Struggle: dealing with racism in my workplace. It's really horrible but for now I'm making a record of every instance. And I'll try my best to make a change at the company from  within.  I can't risk my job right now- I'm just trying to take it day by day. What would you say to your boss if he casually used the n word a few times a week? I give him a dirty look and try to disengage. He's either really dumb and not picking up my body language or doing it to bother me. Probably the 2nd one. I feel like a piece of crap not doing more about it. I'm sorry but it's a tricky situation- I am working on a plan. What makes me sick is he's a decent boss otherwise. But I can't look at him in a good light anymore. ..Triumph: here I am at a year! Whatever is going wrong or right in my life I can feel great about this. We went and got a 4 pack of gourmet donuts from a fancy bakery across town to celebrate- that Boston cream donut was better than a million beers! ..General: Miss Vanjie of Drag Race fame is a wise one.  You gotta pick a struggle. You can't struggle at everything bitch!  Alcoholism I choose you!
Struggle: I really cannot stand a lot of the people I work with they're very toxic and today it's really wearing on me...Triumph: I'm 7 days sober...General: Life is strange right now I'm in a very confusing situation with my ex where she's not sure if she wants to give me another chance or move on so we've been in contact and seeing each other still but I'm sort of in this limbo. She dated a bad alcoholic for years and is afraid to go down that road again although him and I are very different. I understand it though I'm just trying to give her space and hope for the best. If she wants to continue awesome if not oh well I won't drink because of that. I need to quit for me. 
I just admire your perspective so much Mary!  And I looove the "maybe you're right" phrase.  I just gotta get my ego to let me use it.  I'm so damn competitive even such a non-committal phrase makes me feel like I've lost.  Grrr...  In other news have you read "Big Magic" by Elizabeth Gilbert?  It delves into living a creative life with a humorous and pragmatic point of view that reminds me a bit of you...**Struggle:**  Getting derailed again in my career change goal.  Trying to not beat myself up but get back into gear.  I have GOT to get out of this job - I have very little energy after work and feel like it is taking the best of me for very little payback...**Triumph:**  I adulted and talked to a tax preparer about how my taxes got so high and now I understand what's going on (I don't like it but I understand it) so that I can take steps to avoid having to pay next year.  And I got my ass up for an early morning run today instead of spiraling into lethargy like last night's veg session was leading up to.  I will NOT escape my life through TV!!..**General:**  Today will be in the mid '70s here in Denver and this coming weekend we're having snow.  I live in a crazy state!
Stuggle: Just trying to keep my cool yah know? I'm in this for the 1000th time (moderation hasn't been the key) and on day 10. I've noticed I get pretty irritated at comments being said to me (could be about anything and from anyone). A few times I have really shown my frustration to people but in my defense I was hangry and they were pushing my buttons...Triumph: I haven't taken a drink! I'm dealing with my emotions sober so that's cool. ..General: I keep reminding myself that I am in control of myself at work and in my personal life. I keep up with the positive affirmations. I'm still figuring out this new life style and there will be hurdles. I'm not quite ready to run a marathon or go meet new people. But I do know who I don't want to hang out with that I don't want to go to the usual places and that I'm eating a lot of snacks and that's okay I guess. One foot in front or the other is how I'm taking this. ..
Struggle: Still dealing with my loneliness and desire for intimacy. Finding myself constantly let down that it's not something I seem to get used to and that I continually find the types of women who check many of my requirements for partners keep paying attention to me. One of them even said we needed to spend more time together and directly mentioned the possibility of some light bdsm knowing that it's something I enjoy. This whole not dating or sleeping with anyone for a year thing is going to get pretty damned hard if more people keep doing that...&amp;#x200B;..Triumph: Got to reconnect with an old friend last night and enjoy a nice little meal and a long conversation about where we've been in life. It was wonderful to know that she's in a better place than I had seen her last. ..&amp;#x200B;..General: Moving sucks but at least my new roommate is someone I know who's a kickass person who's sober meditates and has a cat I plan to steal whenever I move out from there...&amp;#x200B;
There have been other comments setting the record straight regarding your talent and that ; u/BelindaTheGreat's comment on being rude with a pretentious word being spot on...**Struggle:** Fatigue. I'm at a rehab center to learn to live with my new body; two years ago I downgraded from mediocre but functioning to the cheapest leftover crap in the junkyard. Turns out the fly shit at the bottom of the paper was the fine print saying no returns. Working with oneself is hard! Luckily I've done some real groundwork through this blessed community and the future's so bright I gotta wear shades. And some serious kick ass sunblock. Thanks all!..**Triumph:** I had 500 days this weekend. Sweet!..**General:** [This is where I'm at.](https://imgur.com/a/RprVCL0) One thousand years ago Vikings lived in this area and sailed these seas to plunder the British isles explore Russia populate Iceland and discover America. And I'm taking pictures with my phone greeting all my friends in all these places. To Valhalla!
**Triumph:** I continue to tick along. Life is challenging but I deal. Doesn't sound like much but I drank to cope and there were years in early sobriety where I wasn't sure I could.....**Struggle:** Life is challenging. Both my wife and I have been slammed at work this year. The stress worry and exhaustion spills over into home life. The kiddos are still developing emotional control. When the adults are struggling we can get caught in a vicious feedback cycle of our own creation...**General:** Can you use "maybe you're right" when they're obviously so fucking wrong?
**Struggle:** I've struggled a little bit with some depressed days but I'm trying to prevent a full blown episode by not drinking exercising meetings and getting support. It's hard to deal with though and it makes me want to give up...**Triumph:** I've scheduled a viewing for a house I really liked online. It's perfect for me and my boyfriend and he finally got on board (he was hesitant about location; but when we couldn't find something decent in-town he became willing). I'm hoping it works out!..**General:** Hanging in there. I have a weird mix of feelings of tired bored yet anxious and unmotivated. It's very strange because I don't know what to do to fix it.
S: Mixed feelings shopping for an apartment for my mom. She's 64 and her alcoholism has destroyed her ability to live in her home. She's currently in a wheelchair at a short-term rehab facility for the time being. It's sad because she ran a half marathon in 2013. ..T: Getting an unexpectedly large tax return this year! ..G: I'm now addicted to cranberry club soda mock tails. I drink La Croix during the day so it's nice to  sip on something so tasty as an evening treat! 
Struggle: Now that it's getting nicer out my mind is wandering to all of the activities that will be based around booze that I know will be coming up in the next month or so and I'm also thinking about a trip to FL I have in a couple weeks.  I don't know what my goal really is here I just know I'm at about 10 days without alcohol which is the longest I've gone in a lonnnggg time and I feel proud of myself and healthier already.  I see people posting about being sober for 30 days 60 days etc and it's just... amazing..Triumph: I was at a friend's house last night and she started making me a drink.  She poured the Sprite and was reaching for the booze when I spoke up and said I was OK with just the Sprite for tonight.  She looked at me oddly for a second then moved on with the conversation.  We hung out without my brain being all fuzzy and this morning I woke up guilt free..General: Life is day by day right now.  Thinking too far into the future freaks me out and I attempt not to do it.  This place is an amazing help!
Struggle: I am still struggling to keep my marriage happy. I've changed a lot since getting sober. It's not easy. ..Triumph: last night I called my sponsor and shared with her a secret I've been keeping for 12 years. I feel so much better about it now. I wish I had done so sooner!..General: The sun is shining and the wind is light today. I'm going to a banquet this evening with lots of sober friends. It's going go be awesome! 
An internal response to rude person: *Maybe you're ~~right~~ projecting.*  Seriously to me that statement says more about how that person sees their own work/status....**Struggle:**  Economy is a bit down and so is our business.  Hoping things pick up soon!..**Triumph:**  After years of neglect we are finally getting all the work done to our house to both bring it up to date and have it ready in case we need to sell.  My goal is keep it in top shape from here on so if we end up in a bind and and have to sell I won't have the extra burden of getting it ready...**General:**  At times I can have such low energy after work but all it takes is a little bike ride to re-invigorate me.  
Struggle: My wife has been away for 7 weeks for work and communication is getting harder we have struggled for the last year due to both of our work schedules.  We spend so little time together I think this affects me more than her but we are both committed to making everything work...&amp;#x200B;..Triumph: 21 years ago today I started my last binge with Alcohol.  On Friday I will be 21 years sober.  No matter what struggles I have today none would even exist if I did not quite drinking...&amp;#x200B;..General: Life is good
**Struggle:** I am having a really difficult time finding an AA group that I feel remotely connected to. The last few meetings I've gone to I've left feeling worse than I did when I came in which is making me question what the point of these meetings are supposed to be. I almost feel like I am punishing myself by going to them. I'm still 17 days alcohol-free and do not have a desire to continue but these meetings make me feel like if I am not heavily invested in AA that I will not stay alcohol-free. It's a double edge sword...&amp;#x200B;..**Triumph:** There were recent legal issues pending big big big issues and the charges were dropped!!! I feel like someone is looking over me for sure!! Also I have an apt to see a therapist this Friday so I can start the healing process!! Woohooo!!! Plus I found a website [www.hipsobriety.com](https://www.hipsobriety.com) that i really feel like I can actually relate to when it comes to getting sober for my reasons. ..&amp;#x200B;..**General:** It's been about 17 days since my last drink and I have been learning a lot about why I even pick a drink up to begin with. My anxiety is through the roof and occurs every 3 days or so and "coincidentally" that's about how often I used to drink alcohol. Even though I am not able to fall asleep earlier once I do fall asleep I am out like a rock and I sleep solid until my alarm goes off. Also being so fearful of pending legal charges it really put into perspective about what deserves my anxiety and what does not. Today I feel okay!
Struggle: My self-esteem is bad especially around drinking. I am struggling a lot with being too hard on myself. ..&amp;#x200B;..Triumph: I am doing pretty well having just moved to a foreign country. ..&amp;#x200B;..General: I am creating stuff. I am not stopping nor am I stagnating. I am trying especially in the struggle with stopping drinking and the general life stuff. I am being real with myself.
Headed to college with 7 roomates there who drink alot. I really thought i was gonna have to drop out but turns out its just a break and im going to be back on my grind. IWNDWYT!
Struggle:.My parents visited me for 5 days and seeing my dad's health in decline has sent me back into a deep depression. I haven't gone long without crying. Haven't washed my hair in a week. Just want to crawl into a hole and stay there. But I have to just soldier on. ..Also I was hit by a car that flipped and slid across the road next to me then conquered my fear of being in a car and last night the car I was in was hit. .My anxiety is tough to fight right now. ..Had to take my 3 year old pup to the vet 3 times for bloody urine and I don't trust their conclusion and can't afford a second opinion. ..And I'm just sad. ....Triumph: .Still sober still going to work not even tempted to drink really. ...General:.Ritz crackers are dope. 
friend died of suicide.
Struggle: I've been so fucking depressed lately. To make it worse I'm convinced that I've been bringing my boyfriend down with me and atm it feels like every part of me is just screaming to skip town and start over somewhere else in large part to spare my partner of having to deal with me anymore...Truimph: I start a new job tomorrow. It pays $7 an hour more than I was making at my old job so that is awesome..
Thanks! That comment really lifted me up. I was in an awful mood until I read that. Seriously. 
**Struggle &amp; Triumph**: This is a really hard time for me. My brother died this month and I'm in such deep pain I hardly know how to describe it. This happened right as my husband was leaving for a job opportunity leaving me to mourn alone. I had already been abusing alcohol so I knew this could be my undoing. But I put the bottle down on 3/18...I'm afraid and I'm heartbroken but today I walked past the beer section in the grocery store. I briefly considered buying something but I realized I didn't want to wake up feeling like shit tomorrow on top of everything else. Plus I still have my life. Shouldn't I do something with it? I know I may relapse but not yet not now not today.
Struggle: I am going though a divorce. Although things are amicable it's still very stressful and tough to get used to splitting time with my kids...Triumph: Today is my TWO YEAR soberversary!  I could not imagine how much better my life would be without alcohol. I am still grateful every day for my sobriety although I rarely even think about it anymore!..General: I finally joined a gym and started taking Krav Maga after wanting to do it for several years. Today was my third class and everyone is so friendly and encouraging! 
I went to an event at my old law school and I didn't have a drink at the open bar!!! I'm proud of myself. 
Hi I'm new. Late to today but I don't want to make a whole post. ..**Struggle**: I hate being pregnant. I'm grateful that it's forced me to not drink and it's allowed me to get space to rethink my relationship with alcohol. But I am also a horrible pregnant lady. Third trimester sucks balls. I'm in pain. I'm stressed. I'm emotional. Sobriety is supposed to make you all happy and grateful and how-bout-this-new-lease-on-life right? Not this lady. Life is measurably harder. I do not feel like I'm reaping any personal rewards here. I'm even more irritable than when I drink too much. I swear deep down I do possess perspective on this but right now I just hate everything and I need somewhere to vent about it...**Triumph**: I'm here saying hi. Getting started somewhere.
