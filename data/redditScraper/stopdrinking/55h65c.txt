Hmm I've never thought about this. I would assume no as long as you are taking the correct dose and not chugging the cold medicine to get a buzz. 
That's up to you I wouldn't for taking medication as directed. However I do ask my pharmacist and doctor to recommend non-alcohol-containing alternatives.
Nah you're fine. It's medicine. Not Poison. .Get well soon.
Personally I go for cold medicine without alcohol. I'm not sure if they work better because I'm sober or if they work just as well as the stuff with alcohol but it feels like it's working better because I'm sober. 
There are plenty of good cold medicines without alcohol.  If I were concerned about the alcohol content I would seek out one of these alternatives.

I caught a cold this week. Last night I had the last dose of Nyquil.  And then I went to bed. I took cold medicine - I did not have a drink.  The last time I had Nyquil was in February the last time I had a cold.  Neither dose lead to drinking.  No relapse and no reset here.  I know others may have different opinions but I am comfortable leaving my badge as is.
