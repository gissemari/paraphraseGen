Guess what day it is!..The week's half over.  It's time to share your triumphs and your struggles:..**Triumph**: It's looking like my knee pain is from a torn meniscus.  Yay.  This is a triumph because I've been managing it responsibly (going to the doctor following doctor's orders) and recently it's been feeling a bit better.  I'm supposed to let pain be my guide and lately it hasn't been hurting while I'm playing tennis.  I've just about been able to go all out...**Struggle**: I've got nothing...**General Chat**: The weather here in just-outside-DC is beautiful.  Chilly in the mornings and mid-70s.
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph: just got past 100 days sober. I feel great!..Struggle: My wife is in a bad place right now; her dad's got Parkinson's and is in hospice her siblings are nowhere to be found and there's drama at work. My struggle is to stop thinking so selfishly about myself and focus on getting her in a better place..General chat: I'm in Minnesota and right now we're all Adrian Peterson all the time. I'm a fantasy football player and I drafted the all-abuser team: both Peterson and Ray Rice. My scouting department didn't do a very good job of vetting the backgrounds of my draft picks
Triumph: Started a new training program called PHAT. The name of the program allows for all sorts of bad jokes. First time in ages I've squatted more than a plate! *feels good man*..Struggle: Mother in law's sister passed away yesterday. Funeral is on Saturday. Also bridesmaid and groomsmen from our wedding party are tying the knot on Saturday. Decisions decisions...General chat: sweater weather!..
HUMP DAY BITCHEZZZZZZZZZZZZZ..**Triumph:**  I have 10 dayS of sobriety and in those 10 days I have attended 5 AA meetings.  Yesterday I "came out" to my therapist (who up to this point I have only seen for couples counseling and yesterday we met alone for the first time) and told her about my drinking problem and some other stuff and cried a LOT and just word vomited everywhere.  It felt super great and she was unbelievably supportive.  She also said things make sense now and that she agrees - I am a full blown alcoholic and am doing the right thing.  ..**Struggle:**  I am mourning the absence of wine.  I am craving it.  Every second of every day.  I keep tasting every single sip I have ever had of my best friend Red and I have actually shed tears over the loss of her in my life. I know how utterly ridiculous that sounds but it is true.  I miss her and I am scared of my life without her.  I want this feeling to pass so badly.  ..**General Chat:**  It's fall.  THANK GOD.
**TRIUMPH**: Baby boy born on 9/7. Mom and baby are doing great!..**STRUGGLE**: Sleep as expected...**GENERAL CHAT**: Looking forward to the Chicago meetup which also happens to be on my 1-year sober anniversary.
**Triumph**: I have 32 days sober!..**Struggle**: I'm still smoking cigarettes and still feeling lethargic. ..**General Chat**: I skipped breakfast this morning and now am anxiously awaiting lunchtime. Turn faster clock hands!
Triumph:  Contracting a person from my past and giving them a mindful apology.  They we're very receptive...Struggle:  Turning in an honest rental application today.  Checked "Yes" under evictions. :\..General Chat:  Work is good.  My breakfast was usual..
Woke with a smile on my face specifically knowing "what's up Wenedsday" was going to be awesome!..**triumph** I finally figured out what's next!!!! I decided yesterday to go back to school going to go to admissions for both programs here to compare which is best for me today. My mom is so awesome upon hearing this she said  "I was getting two estimates this Friday to decide which to do first the kitchen expansion or the new bedroom upon hearing this I will call of the kitchen estimate." This feels so amazing I literally have tears of joy welling up as I type...**trial**getting the deposit back on my old house...**general chat** http://youtu.be/Yo-_Y4aL1uo I've posted this before but it is precisely how I feel today that it's hilarious too is a bonus...
Triumph:  I finally got over my anxiety and got a sponsor...Struggle:  I have a lot of resentment towards my ex.  I still live with her and will for about 8 more months so I need to get over it somehow...General Chat:  I started reading *Bleeding Edge* by Thomas Pynchon and it's fucking hilarious.  Don't be put off to the book just because it's Pynchon I think he's gotten playful in his old age.
hump dayyyyyyyy!
Triumph:  7 days 5 meetings 7 straight mornings at the gym. ..Struggle: not being such a touchy irritable dickface to my wife. ..General:  currently cooking lunch 4 different preparations for 30-40 people for tomorrow. Keeping me busy and happy. And I couldn't be happier that it's getting to be sweater/hoody weather in the Midwest. 
Triumph: Four days no alcohol...Struggle: That I might in fact have to go to treatment. I know if it's my reality it will be nothing but positive for me but it's scary. :(..General chat: MY FACE IS DEPUFFING. In just FOUR days I have noticed change in my body. WAHOO! And the weather here in the Twin Cities is beyond gorgeous today.

**Triumph**: I turned down multiple requests to out last night because my friends wanted to hook me up with a girl. Instead got a great night of sleep and got to work early. ..**Struggle**: Staying in last night was a worse struggle than I imagined but it was totally worth it..**General Chat**: My foot is only a few days away from being healed up enough that I can run and ride again. 
**Triumph:** Did a great job at a work thing and looked good doing it! It's over and behind me and I've got nothing but good memories of it...**Struggle:** Feeling a lot of pressure to get stuff done and struggling with the knowledge that it's totally self-imposed. I need to learn to give myself a break!..**General chat:** The weather this week has been SO FRICKING BEAUTIFUL. I'm so happy I'm able to get out there and enjoy it. 
**Triumph:** a couple weeks ago I realized I don't have to worry about my breath or how much I've had before I pick up the kids from school. Loving that feeling...**Struggle:** Dealing with some issues related to my self image and self deception while I was drinking. ..**Chat:** Indian summer here with temps back in the 90s. I'm melting during the day.
**Triumph**: Today's my first day of my sobriety. Hooray!..**Struggle**: Some good friend's opinions of me are still sour because of what I used to do when I drank. I'm looking to turn it around...**General Chat**: This weekend will be my first at college without a single beer in a long time. I'm nervous but really excited for it.
**Triumph:** I had to interview the superintendent of my school for a class assignment as I pursue my masters in educational leadership. He called me an excellent teacher and pointed out several specific examples of my strengths as a teacher...**Struggle:** I'm still fatigued although I seem to have a wee bit more energy today. I've also had a couple moments when I was tempted to drink these past couple of days. I resisted these thoughts though so I suppose that's a triumph!..**General Chat:** My boyfriend and I have a dog now. She's a Shiba Inu and she is very well mannered for a puppy. It's been years since I've had a dog and I was worried I might feel overwhelmed but it is actually nice playing with her and having her around.
It's been too long since I've checked in here in /r/stopdrinking.  I didn't know what's up wednesdays was a thing now but I like it and it's perfect timing as wednesdays are my meeting nights as well...**Triumph.**  Passed 6 months a while back and before 6 months I was sure I wouldn't make it that far.  I was obsessing about the day certain that I would drink once I hit that mark but it's come and gone and all of that anxiety has gone with it.  Closing in on 7 months now and feeling great...**Struggle.**  Family life has been rough things aren't great with my wife and one of my kids is sick again.  We are working on things and my kid is on the mend though...**General chat.**  I guess I already kinda did that.  Sorry to post out of order.  I'm going to try to make visiting this subreddit more of a routine since here is where I started my journey.
