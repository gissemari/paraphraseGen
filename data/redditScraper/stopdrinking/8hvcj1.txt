I'm struggling with bitterness towards past 'friends' and such. I know this is one of the key things to avoid but how? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

It helps to pinpoint why first..Then figure out how to solve that...I think there's different causes some in my control and some I can mend by changing my actions and attitude some things I have to accept were my own responsibility (ie. another person/people can't really *make* me do anything) or maybe I was the the victim of assault and I need to heal from that mentally and emotionally.  ..I google everything.  Yes everything!!!  .You'd be amazed at the wealth of information out there if we keep on digging for it.  ..I've been mighty vexed recently so one thing I'm doing is listening to self-improvement sleep hypnosis on YouTube.  Ha!  Me hypnosis?! Well I'll tell you it could be working because I'm waking up with a new more positive ability.. even a little helps : ).  When someone is telling me all night that  you have the ability to deal with stress it's easy for you  and such it's kinda helpful!  ..I hope this finds you well friend.  I won't drink with you today 
People in AA would tell me to pray for those people. Pray day after day that they get everything you want for yourself and more. You don't have to pray  to  anyone. Make it like you are wishing upon a star if you like. I didn't do that often but as silly as it sounds it is awful hard to keep hating someone you have been praying for for 30 days in a row. ..The other thing they helped me realize is that forgiveness is not for them. It is for me.  Me being bitter didn't harm them a bit. It was harming me. I learned yo forgive so I could move on. Many times I didn't have to tell the ither person. The inventory steps and amends steps helped with this aspect too. ..IWNDWYT
