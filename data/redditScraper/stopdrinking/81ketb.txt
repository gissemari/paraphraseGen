I didn't want to say no because it seemed rude and I didn't want to be wasteful and throw it out (it's very expensive champagne) so I promptly called my normal drinking friend and she is coming over now to take it off my hands. ..I haven't been struggling with too many booze cravings (mainly sugar) but today I have been craving it hard. The Universe is a sick prankster. ..What say you sobernauts? Was that a good strategy or should I have said no or thrown it away? Have any of you ever been gifted booze like that?

You didn't drink it. You didn't hurt your neighbour's feelings or drag her into your situation. And you gave a nice gift to a friend despite your craving to keep the bottle for yourself. Sounds like a damn fine strategy to me!
Bubbly is my drink of choice so I give you credit for employing that strategy! I'm expecting a few as birthday gifts soon and I'll take the same approach!
Perfect thing to do I think!  You don't have to explain why you wouldn't want a bottle of champagne or hurt her feelings and I'm sure your friend will appreciate the gift. And nice one for looking after the cat in he first place   though I'm a self confessed crazy cat lady so I'm biased :)  ..Admirable acts of kindness all round IMO.  Have an internet high five from me and cravings be gone!
Don't let your neighbor see your friend carry it out or it will hurt their feelings. 
My last relapse after 4 months was from a bottle of gifted champagne! I wasn't "out" about not drinking and my employer gave it to me for doing something well. Depending on how strong I felt that day in the future I would have rejected the gift or done like you and accepted it then promptly called someone to get it off my hands. You did the right thing! Nothing good would have come from drinking it.
I probably would have done what you did.
