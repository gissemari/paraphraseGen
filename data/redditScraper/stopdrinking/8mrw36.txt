These are the worst. It's my third day without drinking and I had this dream where I was fucking myself up with my fav beers. I struggled through the same process when I stopped self-harm but after a shitty day like I had it's really hard to tell myself that I won't have a drink...If you can help me through that it'll be wonderful. I don't want to slip again. I always slip in the end.

I'm on day 7 of sobriety and the past 3 nights I've had dreams of drinking and been pissed that I gave up so fast then when I wake up I'm like good it was only dream. But i feel still guilty lmao. I'm in the same boat.
Since I stopped drinking I sleep like a log. I can't remember any dreams. 
Nightmares about drinking are so common as to be nearly universal. Please don't let that get to you. The dreams mean nothing they are not an indication that you're doing anything wrong.
