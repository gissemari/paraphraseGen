Hi subreddit ..I am on day 2 again. I had a few sips of what my friends were drinking on Saturday - and I didn't even think about it. Nothing got out of hand as usual but I feel bad because I still broke my count. I know I can do moderation I have been to AA meetings and therapists and I learned that I do not suffer from the disease of alcoholism. After a lot of trial and error in college I learned to drink for the right reasons and in moderation. I have never been in an MVA or had any run ins with the law..Recently though I decided I wanted to stay sober because my consumption amount and attitude when drinking has changed a lot.   .I am from Venezuela and currently studying in the U.S. I hold dual citizenship. I am working on my doctoral degree so I can get a great job and help my family out. I don't want a big house or a nice car or vacations - I just want to take care of my family they are living in a hell that has lasted almost 20 years. I feel so guilty not being there suffering with and helping them directly. I tell them all of the time I will quit school and take care of my grandparents (who are well into their 90s) around the clock but they are insistent that I keep on studying and working hard for my future. Even if I could get my grandparents here I would not be able to afford out-of-pocket the 24/7 care they require. ..Things have recently escalated recently with the total lack of power in most of the country I am sending them phone battery banks with solar panels so we can keep in touch but it still tugs at my heart every time I think about it I don't want to even eat because I know they struggle to find food. I have just been wanting to drink every single day so I can try to cope with the guilt and anxiety it is no longer for fun. I keep waiting for the call saying that someone else passed away from malnutrition or another one of their cars got stolen or someone else got shot by someone trying to rob them - all of which have happened while I am here and they are there. It doesn't help that there are people in the U.S. who have no idea what is going on but openly support that dictator and won't listen to an actual Venezuelan.   .I know ultimately I will be the most help with a great job but I still want to drink so I can just not think about it for a few moments and I can stop having nightmares about it.   .I don't know if this is survivor's guilt but it is getting more difficult to deal with it without the option of a buzz.

I know you want to help your family. To do that you must help yourself first. Take care of you in order to be able to take care of them in the long term. Drinking made my stress worse and also my nightmares. IWNDWYT
