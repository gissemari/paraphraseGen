I'm curious to see if there is anyone else here who has experienced the problem I have...Over the last few years I have developed what can only be described as some sort of intolerance to alcohol. ..Basically on a night I drink I go to bed feeling fine and when I wake up I have about an hour before it hits me. I then will vomit for a minimum of 7 hours (sometimes 12) every half hour. I get sinus pain cold sweats and I shake. I have been to hospital twice to get an anti nausea injection. This can happen after a night I've only had 3 wines. Sometimes I will wake up fine and I have had much more than that. I never drink as much as my friends and they always wake up a little rough but get on with their day while I can literally not leave the bathroom or bed. ..This leaves me with a bad stomach for days (can't eat much/bathroom problems) dehydrated and normally take 4 days to recover. ..Some people can not believe I put myself through this so often but drinking with my friends has been the last 6/7 years of my life. It is also hard that I don't excessively drink yet have an excessive reaction. I set myself a goal I would stop for a month and go from there. I am still struggling to be social and am quite sad that I am having to give up this part of my life I really like the social act of drinking. ..EDIT: Found other young people with same problem. For anyone who might want to see they are not alone in this http://www.steadyhealth.com/alcohol_intolerance____t77502.html?page=1.

That my friend is a scary symptom.  Please promise you'll speak to a physician about your symptoms.  ..If you want to stop drinking this is the place to get support.  
I would consult with a medical professional regarding those symptoms.  I can't speak for anyone else but I never had that reaction in my decade of drinking...It is scary to give up a social ritual that you're used to but it is entirely possible to develop new ones.  Good friendships aren't affected by someone deciding not to drink - they just change and new activities replace the old.  New friendships and social circles replace the bar/club scene.
