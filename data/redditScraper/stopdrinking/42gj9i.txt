Today is going to be one of my hardest days.  For the past few years Sundays have been *my* day.  My day of no rules: I eat whatever I want and I drink as much as I want.  I know some people struggle with Friday and Saturday nights but I'm usually able to manage those evenings by just staying shut in with a movie or going to bed early...Sundays however are an all day affair (usually starting with brunch and ending with me passed out hard around 11pm).  This morning I woke up early with tea and read for a few hours.  My plan for the day is to meet a friend for lunch at a deli type place that doesn't serve alcohol so I can avoid the usual never-ending mimosa struggle at brunch places.  Then we are going to the movies.  Now this is where it's going to get hard.  I always get a beer at the movies or more likely two or three.  The friend I'm hanging out with today doesn't really drink so she never gets alcohol at the movies it's just me (but she's been to the movies with me enough to expect me to immediately grab a beer and she doesn't say anything about it).  She's also not a recovering alcoholic (she's just one of those strange people who literally only thinks about drinking on vacation and even then will have like one cocktail the whole time while I'm over there downing the pitcher of margaritas) so she doesn't understand the overwhelming need I feel when I see those beer taps lined up or the server pouring that bottle of wine into that too-tiny plastic cup.  I haven't told her I'm trying not to drink anymore either because I'm just not ready to share that with anyone and I honestly can't bring myself to commit to forever -- I'm just trying to focus on one day at a time right now.  I realize this secrecy is only making my struggle harder but I've told people in the past I was going to quit drinking and failed and I can't face admitting failure again...Anyway I thought maybe sharing these worries would help me get through this day sober.  Hope you all are having a great sober Sunday!  ..TL;DR:  Sundays are my hardest day to stay sober.
