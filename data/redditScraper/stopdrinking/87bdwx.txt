60 days alcohol free today and im so f-ing stoked! Thank you all for the support and kindness. This community has been such an amazing resource in getting me this far. To anyone struggling in their first few days week or whatever hang in there. It gets easier. Life is far from perfect now and i still have a lot of things i need to work on but i dont want to trade this feeling for anything.  I will happily not drink with all of you today.

Grats!!! I am not far behind you now :) I'm not fully back to normal yet but I am gradually feeling better day at a time. How about you?
I will happily not drink with you either!  60 days is a huge milestone.  It was for me it was like a different space in my head.  Let's keep it moving!
Congrats! It's a milestone demonstrating momentum. IWNDWYT!
Congratulations on 60 days! Awesome work!
