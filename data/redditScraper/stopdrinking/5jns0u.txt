Well done pal good work!
I'm feelin' the love.  Sober pillow contact is a high all its own.
Indeed!  Sober Sleep is Soothing.......
Nice work!
Awesome. That's the goal for each and every day Day 1 or Day 1000. Well done. 
Hitting the pillow sober sure does beat the time I hit the pillow drunk and woke up covered in my own vomit! 0/10 would not recommend. Nice job!
Every single night this is the thought I have right before I drift off: I  hit the pillow sober!
What did that pillow ever do to you? Really though great job. The day is long and full of temptations. 
I love my bed now. It is a place to relax and rest. Great job!
First day is so hard congrats to you. I will not drink with you tonight. Enjoy another sober nights rest. It is truly a blessing. 
Though I am still in my early days each of my 70 plus nights I have got into bed I am thankful.  I have similar thought if I make midnight pee trip and each morning in the shower.  All of them involve how much I enjoy sobriety and feeling well.
One of the best parts about sobering up for me has been waking up after 7 good hours of sleep without a hangover. I've always been a morning person -- even when hungover almost every day -- and this has really upped my productivity and happiness. Coffee! Coffee is so much better when it doesn't give you a headache.
My head hit the pillow sober but I can't sleep and am struggling not to get dressed and head to the store.
Awww yea:)
I plan on it.

The best pillow is a clear conscious.
