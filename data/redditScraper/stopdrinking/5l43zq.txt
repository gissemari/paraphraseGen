I have 94 days. I am in AA and going to 4-5 meetings week. Did any of you struggle with others saying "your not an alcoholic" etc? I keep thinking about whether I was truly "addicted". My therapist clearly said I was an alcohol abuser but I was not physically dependent on it. I certainly know my life is better without it and I tried to moderate but I could not. It is just the line of being an alcoholic doesn't seem so black and white. It was causing problems in my relationships also. I guess I need to stop comparing my drinking problem with others and just be happy that I am better off without it! ..Also on the internet I have read that 30% of population does not drink. Does this seem high to you guys? Now that I am in recovery circles I see other people who do not drink but it just seems like ALMOST everyone drinks somewhat but maybe I am overestimating it....

If alcohol was causing problems in your life then it does not matter what label people chose the only solution is to remove alcohol from your life...Great job on 94 days!..
