https://wellpleasedwedream.wordpress.com/2018/11/02/paracas-comrades-of-the-wind/.An article by Vittoria Benzine on her struggles with sobriety and dealing with the emotions of relapsing. She explores her own decisions through an art show about Peruvian folklore...For Transparency sake I'd like to note I run the website it's published on WellPleasedWeDream.com but I wanted to share the article with people who can relate. Thanks for positivity and best of luck to everyone fighting their demons. It's a battle you can win.
