A question to those who have more digits on their counters than I do. At what point in your sobriety did you notice an improvement in cognitive function supposing at all that you struggled with this while drinking? I had major issues with focus motivation problem solving and more and am hoping that my recent lifestyle change will help. I expect it's different for all just looking for your experiences. ..

It's gradual . It's subtle. Anti-depressant meds might be responsible for my poor memory and generally feeling dumb... or maybe I was always this way? Who knows. ..One thing I wish I had done for the physical part.. take pics and compare body face and skin tone a few months apart.
Drinkers often have an exaggerated view of their own abilities.
