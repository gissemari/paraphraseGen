Now I am again on day 0. Badge reset request sent.  Not to say that I was really drunk but still can feel the hangover. It's not the worst but you know... I asked myself  "Is that what you wanted to get?". Totally not worth it. .I still have my 40 days and I know that I can stop drinking. Not for forever but sure I can do it for today. Today I will not drink with you.

Hiya. You can do this. IWNDWYT   
Congrats on continuing your sober journey after this hiccup. IWNDWYT
Welcome back! IWNDWYT 
Forty days is impressive.  And you are right...you didn't lose those days.  I'm back on day one too.  Didn't go overboard yesterday but I wish I hadn't done it.  So we are starting again.  We can do it.  IWNDWYT.
The first time I quit for a month was the longest three days of my life (ha!). It took me several tries to finally hit my stride with longish-term abstinence but I view those first few attempts as warm-up laps. Congratulations on achieving forty   not everyone can do something that difficult. 
I honestly look at all those times that I didn't make it as the building blocks-foundation for what I'm doing now which really feels right for me. all of my failed attempts have manifested into invaluable knowledge about myself and my inner workings. I feel that my failed attempts to quit drinking have provided me a greater insight insight myself.. that I would not have otherwise and which  if I'm finally going to pull this off I will need in the long run anyway. resetting the badge is part of the process
Heck yea! 30+ is such a milestone I think no matter if you go back to  1'. IWDWYT
You can always start over.  Its about working up to ending habits like this.  It takes many attempts and you can always start over and try again.  Forgive yourself.  You can do it!
