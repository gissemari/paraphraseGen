For the last week I've been trying to get into rehab but I haven't been able to find any beds open and no one can tell me when one will be open. So today I tried calling a couple of the guys I met at a meeting I attended a few months ago before I 28 day dry spell then a relapse then back and forth back and forth. I finally got to a point where I don't even want to drink anymore but I know I need help to stay sober and I figured if I was gonna check myself into rehab and can't get into one my only other solution was to completely surrender myself to the program if I could find a ride. Prior to this I didn't recieve any calls back from the people who gave me their numbers but this time one of the guys who picked up offered to give me a ride. The people seemed very supportive not the judgemental vibe I got from some meetings. I gave my number to a few guys and told them to call me and leave a message so I had theirs as I have a google voice account and no cell phone. I'm kind of kicking myself as I should've written their numbers down just in case so I'm picking at the callouses on my hands nervously hoping I'll receive a call specifically from one guy who lives in the same town as me who attends meetings everyday and I can catch a ride with. I'm trying to keep myself calm about it as I really want to give this a shot full force as I have no other choice and I live too far away from the meetings to walk and I haven't gotten the bus schedules down yet in these boonies or where to wait for them at. I'm just really hoping he calls I know I have another guy as a backup but he lives in the next town over and I don't want to be too much of a burden. I dunno just posting this to get it out and give my hands something better to do than pick at my hands.

Thanks for your post. Keep trying to get into rehab. The structure and support is invaluable. Kudos for your efforts in getting to a meeting. Are you going to have any problems withdrawing? I did and received medical help with detox. Keep us posted. Bravo for being on the second day of sobriety!
