First of all you're gonna hate me but I didn't experience withdrawal except for the first day. I'm lucky and maybe that will help encourage others who haven't gone too far off the deep end and keep reading. You don't have to but this is also for me and I'd like to come back and read it some time...I'm 28 and 260 lbs so I drank heavily every night for years (started off at 185 lbs) to go to sleep. I was (am) a self-medicator and I was using alcohol to treat my symptoms of stress. Come this year I buy a house-- same day I have my first panic attack and I get diagnosed with anxiety disorder. Drinking increased. Then I get burglarized. Drinking now heavily increased. I went from drinking to sleep to drinking to manage my stress and then eventually I was sipping whiskey the moment I woke up because I had physical stress in my body and I knew that alcohol made the feeling go away...I thought-- I'll just drink until this physical feeling goes away and then I won't need it thinking I had a unique situation with my anxiety and ignoring the knowledge that alcohol only increases anxiety since mine was of course unique. Odds are that those physical feelings were probably withdrawal and I was only feeding it. This behavior of drinking from morning to night went on for a month. Come a blessing in disguise-- I started throwing up in the mornings from brushing my tongue. It just took one wrong gag and then it reminded me about throwing up every time so it would happen. Then I threw up a little blood...Remember my anxiety disorder? I was freaking out real bad. I was deathly afraid of a heart attack at any time during the last some months. After hoops and ladders I end up at the ER because that's the only place I could get my blood tested on a Sunday for something like anemia or making sure my blood count was normal. I got an EKG my blood tested and other things I can't remember. Then I got the best thing I could have received: a caring doctor who provided me with the knowledge I needed...He spent extra time with me because unlike the rest of his patients who end up there he told me I had plenty of time to get my body healthy without side effects. He wasn't worried about the blood in my throw up-- but he did say that my stomach most likely got the small tear because my stomach lining was damaged from drinking whiskey. He told me he'd bet his career on me not having a heart attack based on the blood results and the data. And most importantly he explained how my liver enzymes were way too high (or low) and that would only happen based on my drinking habits that I had fully described to him. He directly told me that it had to stop now or else I'd be like his other patients in 5 to 10 years with a tube down my throat and got me another resource who provided me with plenty of support options...You can bet that all I wanted was a drink that day but knowing that I couldn't do it with the knowledge he'd given me helped me drive on. Day 2 to now-- I woke up no skin crawling or other symptoms that would make me want to drink. I've been feeling physically and mentally better than ever and because of that I've had no urge to drink. Was all it took just a one day break off of alcohol which was fuelling my anxiety? Was it because the doctor bet his career on me not having a heart attack any time soon? Was it because I prayed to Jesus to heal my body?..All I can say is I'm thankful. And I hope anyone out there who might be reading and who is also struggling gets what they need to help them stop. If you self medicate like me I highly suggest getting your blood tested-- it gives you the cold hard facts...Going forward I'll be talking to a new counselor who specializes in alcohol abuse. I've got a vacation coming up in a few months and I'm going to see if the counselor suggests I get my blood tested and if it's clear then I'm safe to drink at it or if they suggest I don't drink at all based on my previous habits. I know this for sure-- I've posted here before with confidence that I could do this on my own-- but I'm no longer leaving that decision up to myself. For now I will happily not drink with you today.

Congrats on the 5 days! ..I don't think anyone is going to be mad about the lack of withdrawals though. Mine were comparatively mild aland I still wouldn't wish it on anyone. ..There is one topic that I don't think gets discussed enough and it's what's known as "The Pink Cloud". ..It's a kind of euphoria or high on life feeling that can happen in early sobriety. ..I saw this for myself when I was in rehab. Some of the guys there were just so happy so confident so positive they were quite literally in their glory. I was *so* jealous of that and more than a bit annoyed too. I was miserable lost confused uncertain etc. I really wanted the joy and happiness but at the same time their feelings just pissed me off because I felt it was unfair that they got to be happy and so sure about everything and I didn't. ..The thing about the pink cloud is that it's only temporary and further into my stay there I became really glad that I didn't get saddled with that curse because when they fell off that pink cloud they fell hard and fast. From my perspective it seemed that their recovery didn't really begin until they came back to reality and some of them unfortunately couldn't handle the landing and relapsed soon after. ..I'm not saying that this is what you're going through I can only speak to my own experiences and observations. Just be aware that your emotions may turn on a dime I know mine certainly did...IWNDWYT
Oh how painful are anxiety attacks they suck big time I remember being in the back of the ambulance a couple of years ago and I was shaking violently my arm started locking up I was breathing so fast I was hyperventilation! Alcohol makes anxiety better but then it makes it worse smoking sets mine off sometimes too. I'm glad you are making the right decision to quit. Good luck friend. We can do this!
