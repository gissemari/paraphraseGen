The holidays were a mess but I am so happy it's over! Can't wait to ring in 2019 with a healthy mindset and positive outlook on this beautiful life!  I wanted to say thank you to this sub. Everyone has been so kind and supportive from my falls to my struggles and no one judged me.  You are all amazing!  Happy New Year! Peace and love
