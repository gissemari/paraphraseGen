Hey all. .Just kinda checking in I guess. I come back here all the time just to see how many days my count has gotten up to just had one of those 'wow' moments this time haha. Friendly reminder if you're here there's a reason. If you're reading this as you're struggling keep going. I never thought I could make it this far. This is still the longest I've gone without drinking since I ever got drunk for the first time at 14 or 15 or something. Idk again just felt like posting... Don't think I've thrown up once since I quit used to be at least a weekly occurrence if not daily. No more shakes. No more regrets every morning. No more getting in to trouble needlessly. No more waking up with unexplained bruises. No more having people worry about me. No more hangovers. No more fear of getting pulled over still half drunk from the night before. No more getting into trouble. Still get the odd drunk dream weird good persistent they can be lol Anyway thanks for reading if you've made it this far. .This sub helped me immensely especially in the early days of sobriety. So glad I found this place and got myself a badge when I did. Can't really even find the words. Endlessly grateful is a good start. Have a good one y'all. Keep on keepin on!

HaPpY 523 days of Freedom!     .Woohooo!!! IWNDWYT 
Congratulations on your continued sobriety! Exactly what you said - ditto here. ..So I have an innocent intended to be silly question. Obviously you made your username before your sobriety. Is it still accurate? Or did that improve?.I'm kidding around.  But ya never know. .
I've never had a drunk dream what's the experience like?
Thanks for sharing your success.  IWNDWYT
