On this day two years ago I left detox and took the first voluntary action aimed at obtaining sobriety I checked into a 90 day drug and alcohol treatment facility. I had reached a point where I was finally willing to ask for help with a problem I cannot control the disease of addiction. There is no cure for addiction it cannot be controlled by willpower and it cannot be managed alone; who successfully controls their diabetes without help by sheer strength of will?..Roughly one month before that date I met with a counselor at that facility who invited me to check into treatment on that day. I refused because I thought I was too busy and that I was managing my addiction fairly well. I was wrong and I nearly lost everything I was working toward as well as my life. ..When I left the treatment center on that day Ed asked me something that changed my life. He said to me "Okay so you think you can handle this on your own. If you are wrong and it gets much worse or something terrible happens or you relapse will you be willing to check into treatment then?" I didn't answer him but the seed had been planted...When I finally came out of the haze and found myself locked in detox with a doctor telling me my heart had stopped the day before I accepted that I couldn't do it alone. I called and booked my spot in treatment. I have now been sober over two years and my life has changed so much I have kept a job and I am in graduate school! This wonderful path of sobriety is available for any alcoholic or addict who seeks help; it hasn't been easy but I have never been alone in this journey...So for anyone struggling with their sobriety or anyone who is trying to control a chronic disease all by themselves I ask you this question: If you relapse or your drinking/drug use gets much worse or something terrible happens will you finally be willing to accept help and seek treatment?
