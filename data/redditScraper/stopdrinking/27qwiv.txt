RANT: TL;DR @ end..But when I honestly reevaluated my life I can attribute the following completely to drink: been arrested twice once for shouting at police because they wouldn't let me in an ambulance with my equally drunk friend and once for jumping over car bonnets after a period of abstinence. Two of the cars were undercover police cars and another was a bouncers who was across the road. That ended in an adult caution and a  3800 ($5164) fine that took me 3 months working full time during college to pay off. I've started fights with strangers and had the shit kicked out of me by a bouncer in Canada because I was hammered I've thrown up/blacked out more times than I can honestly remember I left my girlfriend at a ball and woke up blacked out in my tux in bed I've kicked off a wing-mirror I've thrown glass bottles in the street just to see how far I can throw and to hear the smash I've pissed on peoples doorsteps spent  1000's of euro got in arguments with friends talked absolute SHITE for hours while repeating myself constantly stolen pints fallen over made a complete fool of myself spent ENTIRE days in bed because of hangovers dropped a laptop on a female friend and given her a black eye seriously contemplated suicide during semi regular binges to the point of planning how I would do it how people would feel. I once woke up with a really drunk and barely legible suicide note on my bedside table and loads of painkillers and some rum on my bed... I never told anyone about that and brushed it off as a drunken act of madness. It's literally only now that I've actually listed all the negative side-effects of drinking. I honestly thought that I get a little crazy and mischievous when I drink and that's what all my friends would say to you if you asked them they'd say "ah he goes a bit mad sometimes but he's grand he doesn't have a problem or anything like that". This is because I only drink once a week/ once a fortnight and it doesn't always lead to that. That being said I've seriously fucked up 100's of times and if I do again in Ireland I'll get a criminal record. .. A friend of mine is up in court for drunk and disorderly and I found myself telling him "no spirits anymore man they're dangerous" when in reality I should have been saying "cut down on your drinking altogether this could fuck up your life"... 56% of Irish males binge drink once a week. All my friends drink 1-4x a week and everyone I know is the same. It's only starting to dawn on me now that this is really fucked up and not normal. The perceived benefits don't seem to be worth the potential risks. ..I never pass a pub and have a craving for a pint I can go weeks without drinking and can count the times I've drank by myself on one hand but when I do drink a pint I'd always fancy another and although I don't always have it if the company I'm with is up for it I'll keep drinking pint after pint until last call or my money runs out... I guess what I'm really struggling with is that if i was to say my drinking was a problem people would literally laugh in my face and think I was taking the piss. They'd say "sure you don't drink every day you don't have cravings for drinking you don't get drunk by yourself all the time therefore you don't have a problem"...What I'd like to know is if a college student acted like I do infrequent binges many fuck ups eager to keep drinking once started would it be considered a problem where you're from? I'm wondering if this is an Irish thing or a college student thing that no one seems to think it's weird...TL;DR : I've fucked up many times when drinking and tend to not stop once I've started but don't have cravings drink every day or get drunk by myself often. Would this be considered fairly normal for a college student where you're from or is it part of a collective denial of Irelands drinking problem?
----------immediate responses--------

I wouldn't say it's common behaviour for college students here in canada. But I would say it's common behaviour of college students who happen to be addicted to / dependent on alcohol. 
Only you can decide if you have a problem.  It doesn't matter about Ireland or college demographics I believe change starts with the individual...Do you want to stop drinking or not?...
