A year ago today launched a 90-day streak for me. Although this number is small compared to most people here it felt like quite an accomplishment. I ruined everything by going on vacation because the cravings got too strong for me to talk myself out of. Even my wife was glad to help me relapse even though this was in no way her fault...I've always been more of a sneaky alcoholic rather than a blatantly drunk person but 4-6 beers on most days goes against my otherwise healthy lifestyle. ..**TL;DR:** Has it helped any of you to set up a fun challenge like this? I'm honestly hoping it will lead to a totally sober life but I'm using the baby-steps approach...Thank you and I'm glad to be here again.

Hi one day at a time its all I do...I had close to 6 months last time and got relaxed. Today I am at 109 and will be happy to make it to 110. Then 111 is the next goal...Thats how Im dealing with it now.
If you challenge yourself to 180 days I will challenge myself to 180 days too! Our stories are similar (just doesn't fit with otherwise healthy life) - let's beat our personal bests and keep going....one day at a time :)
