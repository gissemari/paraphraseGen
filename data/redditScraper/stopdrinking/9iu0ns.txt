I've known I've had a problem with drinking for a long time. For most of that time I told myself it was just a release and the real problems were deeper. And in a way that was true. ..I struggled with depression and self-harm as a teenager and over time I replaced the self-harm with "self-medication." I smoked too much weed I drank far too often. Unlike a lot of others I know I never had an issue doing these alone. Smoking a bowl in three going to a bar by myself drinking a pint of Jim Beam in my dorm while my roommates studied. I lived in my own head and found excuses for why it was okay and told myself these things were actually helping. They definitely did serve as distractions but they didn't truly help. I ended up taking a leave of absence from college last fall (partly for personal reasons - but also because my solution to those personal problems was to drink every day) and have yet to go back. I ruined a relationship I was seriously invested in because she thought I wasn't taking care of myself and she couldn't watch me throw my life away. I've made so many goals only to push them off or give up in favor of going out at night and spending my days high...I've known for a long time I've had a problem with drinking. I used to like to say "I know drinking isn't going to solve my problems but not drinking isn't going to solve my problems either." And that's true - not drinking alone won't solve my problems. I need to solve them. But I'm sure not drinking will help give me the space and clarity to do that...I've tried (half-heartedly) before. I've been a subscriber to this sub for over a year. I've looked up local AA chapters. I've kept drinking the whole time. Today's day two - and I've had many day twos. But I've never once had a day five in over six years. But this time feels different. ..IWNDWYT

You're right.  Drinking doesn't solve anyone's issues but it certainly makes them matter less (temporarily at least).  ..Sobriety's not going to be all sunshine and rainbows.  Sometimes it's going to be really really shitty.  But at least you're giving yourself a shot at fixing those other problems.  ..I'm also on day two (again).  Hopefully this time it'll stick for us both?
