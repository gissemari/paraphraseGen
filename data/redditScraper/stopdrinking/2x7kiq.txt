Hi all. I have 13 days sobriety from alcohol.  I've been reading some posts on here and thought it might help to make this part of my support system.  I had been drinking nearly every night for the past 15 years (I have alternated with smoking pot over the years but most drinking toward the end).  Since November 2014 I've been going to AA meetings an average of every day.  I've had a sponsor since December 2014 and I'm on step 9.  I broke up with my girlfriend a couple weeks ago which caused my last relapse - I had 43 days sober before that.  I've been unemployed for 16 months but finally started looking for work in January.  I don't have much to fill my life and days other than AA meetings exercise some time with my parents reading tv and other random things in life.  I'm still fighting the cravings every day but thankfully I'm taking Antibuse and can generally catch myself when I start going a few days without (setting myself up for a relapse).  Right now I'm angry that I'm alcoholic and have to deal with AA etc.  I'm also frustrated because I want to get a job and girlfriend and settle down but I know that I may not be ready for either of those things.  I'm having trouble accepting my current situation being patient trusting in the process and in AA.  I guess it's good that I'm feeling anything at all after 15 years of running from reality and numbing out.  I'm still occasionally in denial about my alcoholism and struggle with step 1 but I'm starting to catch glimpses of the extent of my denial and how far from reality I've been.

This is good for you to write and good for me to read. I've gone back and fourth drinking and quitting. Running from reality is what I've been doing as well bouncing around from city to city on the West Coast. I had a spell of sobriety that lasted nearly 9 months a couple years ago. It was the most boring 9 months of my life but I got in such great shape that I competed in a fitness competition. I loved the clearing of the "fog of alcoholism" where it became very clear what I was to do with my day. Now I'm back on the sauce wanting to quit and trying to clear the fog again. Worst part: I'm the best bartender in my city introducing new trends of liquor beer wine smoked cocktails flaming cocktails liquor infusions reverse spherification and hosting future classes of mixology called Burbonomics 101. My favorite jacket everybody recognizes me from is a bad ass Maker's Mark jacket given to me by the liquor reps here in Montana. I can't put my Slim Shady to sleep!
Welcome willingtoaccept. You'll fit right in here.
