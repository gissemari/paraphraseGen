I'm struggling today with pain.  I woke up this morning grumpy and hurting.  I have a terrible toothache that came out of nowhere so I am going to try to rearrange my schedule and get in to the dentist to see what is wrong.  Drinking used to be my preferred painkiller.  I used it to numb back pain general aches and most of all emotional pain.  Today I will take care of myself.  Today I will not temporarily cover my pain with poison.  I will not drink today.

Pain used to be a big trigger for me. Especially monthly cramps (sorry if TMI) which I used to treat with a couple midol and some chardonnay. I hope your tooth feels better! I can honestly say I did a lot of damage to my teeth and gums with the years of drinking and they are finally getting back to normal. 
Pain is really difficult. But when we stay sober we are motivated to address the source of the pain and get treatment for it which is something I would procrastinate so much when I was drinking.
oh please do not drink to numb pain.  It doesn't work.  My brother did that for his pain and ended up drinking himself to a slow painful death.  I won't drink with you!
