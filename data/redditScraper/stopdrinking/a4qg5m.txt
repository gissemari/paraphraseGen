The best part about celebrating my second year of sobriety is that I almost forgot about it.  For everyone who has felt the pain &amp; struggle that comes with having alcohol sitting front &amp; center of your mind please know that there is hope for a beautiful new life that is so full that there is no place for alcohol.  I have spent the day thinking about the unexpectedly deep snowfall playing with my twin boys in the snow cooking doing some online shopping on Amazon in preparation for Christmas &amp; rearranging my new living room furniture. Two years ago today I was in the ICU having drank myself extremely ill.  ..A lot has changed about my life since that day but there is really only one change that I made. I still am impatient and stubborn; I didn't become a marathon runner or start eating super healthy like I thought I would. I am still married to the same wonderful man and I still get bitchy for no reason and have to apologize to my husband and children from time to time. All I do is not drink no matter what sometimes in 5 minute intervals. ..Thank you to every one of you who participates in this sub. You are my inspiration today &amp; every day.
