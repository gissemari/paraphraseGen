I am a week sober today. I have been going to a meeting every day which has helped immensely. ..I am struggling today though - It's just been a perfect storm of events:..- Tired this morning but I hit the gym anyway.- Had a rough meeting with an ex-colleague this morning. He spent a lot of time talking about how my boss isn't who he says he is and this has me questioning things..- I have collectors calling. There is a new one today. It's like every time I turn around there is another $1000 owing..- It's raining..Logic and reason are going pretty strong right now. I don't want to throw away my progress but on the flip-side I am also at that critical time where it wouldn't be so hard to get back to a week sober. I am trying to play the tape forward...This disease sucks..---..**EDIT: I beat it! Instead of going to the liquor store I remembered that I had my gym clothes from this morning's workout. No rules against working out twice in one day right? I FEEL LIKE A MILLION DOLLARS NOW**

You are doing great! You came on here and shared your feelings. You are working out despite being tired. AND you are dealing with a bunch of stress at work. Cut yourself a little slack you are just getting used to feeling all the feels that alcohol destroys. When you get through it you will will be so much stronger and happier. Think of sobriety as the gym for your emotions the first few weeks are the hardest. Cut yourself a little slack and get lots of rest when you can. You're doing awesome. So many people out there don't even try. I won't drink with you today. 
hang in there buddy! .someone else just posted something similair and the cravings went away after eating some food. link: https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/6p9m30/its_crazy_how_much_halt_actually_works/.if its not time to eat a big meal maybe have a snack or five?.if you have the time i reccommend popping in to the irc chat and vent. the people there are great for distraction :)
I resisted the urge today and it feels good..You can do it!
There is no problem that drinking (and that nasty hangover) makes better. You keep doing what you're doing! Reaching out and being honest about feeling this way is so admirable something I need to get better at myself! Stay strong and practice some self care and I will not drink with you today!
Glad you're here!!  You're not alone!..I finally realized that it wasn't *lack of willpower* as my issue but rather *Lack of In Real Life Support*.  That's all I needed!..I went to meetings and immediately found people who understood what I was experiencing.  I got tools resources support and fellowship to first stop drinking and then to live sober...Now I just forgo ONE drink today - The First One..Never been happier!
Good one!  Congrats on a week.  It's so much easier to face and deal with these blips in the road sans the booze.  You got this. I won't drink with you today.
