Hey all. I am here because im close to the last straw. I have struggled with addiction my whole life. I was introduced to subastances at a young age. I was bullied and rejected by peers and family as long as I can remember. I always aspired to be part of something to belong and be part of the "joke" not "be the joke". This is the best way I can explain it. When I was in my teens I was the butt of jokes from my cousins. They played games (resident evil etc). So determined through and unknown force ( I now know as hate) I spent countless nights perfecting my gaming skills. I would be better than them through a growing medium of competition. This worked for a while but as I got better they grew in animosity. They ridiculed me more and I secluded from everything. I was lost in the gaming world. I believed as a young 13 yr old that games made me strong. At this time Halo 2 and live gaming became prevalent. I convinced my parents to buy me a subscription. I was amazing at this game. I became obsessed and gamed constantly. I was seeking some kind of acceptance. The only hapiness I felt was from my uncles. They were funny and loved by my family! I thought "how did they do this"? Well one night we had a family get together for a birthday. I noticed that my aunt made a good batch of margaritas ( i knew what alcohol was kinda at this point). Several of my family that I looked up to were drinking these margaritas and making everyone laugh. So when they all went to sleep I took the jug of margarita mixed with hornitos and tecate and poured a glass. I drank 3 glasses worth and thought nothing of it. Around my sixth glass I remember playing original far cry Multiplayer with my online buddies and remember feeling complete elation and relaxation. The next day I had varsity golf practice and remember puking at every port o potties at any hole I could. I discovered my in. I drank recklessly. I even started doing drugs. The first time I smoked weed I was a junior in high school. I had lunch then smoked a bowl with friends. I came back to school and went to calculus. Somehow I understood limits and derivatives and even enjoyed learning rates of change. I did this for two years. I went from a 2.1 gpa to graduating with 3.8 honors. When I graduated I felt a need to take a vacation away fron schooling. So I did. I took a job at a Window sales company (worst thing to happen to my life). I was okay at sales yet I came up short. One day I saked a co worker if they knew anyone who solde weed and or vicodin. They directed me to another co worker. A worker that was known as a king around the office. He could sell anything. When approached said co worker said he had something better than weed or pills. He said he had heroin. I nervously said "nah man doesn't that ruin your life and job"? He replied with what I now know to be the downfall of my entire life: "No man im on it now! I do fine here im even on it now"! So I anxiously asked for some. He sold me half a 1/4 quarter gram of black for $40 (at the time a 1/4 of a gram went for $15). I hesitantly took the heroin and as I got home I went on our family 2008 apple computer and looked up how to do heroin. I found a sketchy page on "catching the dragon". I found out you can do heroin without a needle. So I took a strip of tin foil and an old straw and free based the heroin. The feeling as the smoke entered my lungs was pure bliss. All the dissonance shame regret embarrassment loneliness seclusion was taken away by the pungent smoke of this substance. I became addicted for two years. Somehow I escaped it's grip and got a good job. I was the co ownwer of a Roof Sales company. This lasted for a couple years. However it went to shit due to my roommate being a bad person. He got out of probation and began smoking meth. He then became a monster (torturing his dog and me). I ran away and resided with ky parents and got a great job with benefits and great pay. Now 4 years later from the roommate incident I have a full time job with my great benefits part time job. I have been through rehab for alcohol with ny job. Have relapsed 3 or 4 times. I am slipping back into my alcoholic ways. I just want to go. I have nothing to give. My life has been nothing but a burden to my family. I never feel comfortable being myself. I feel all im doing is paying rent and bills and living for the moments I can be fucked up by either alcohol or drugs (where I find happiness no matter how fleeting)I am 28 years old and although I won't directly take my life I drink to hopefully not wake up someday. I often dream of somehow being approached by a stranger with heroin. I give them all my savings for as much heroin I can buy. I live out my life alone feeling the warmth of heroin again. Nothing else matyers..
----------immediate responses--------

I apologize for the spelling and grammatical errors. I am in the throws of a bad drinking binge. I just wanted to get something out there as I am close to giving up. This is not a cry for help. It is... well I don't know what. Im in a very dark place. Somehow I am still functioning. I have work soon and I just want to drive to the LQ and buy more enough to enter into a deep drunken non-existengance and slip intoan eternal sleep. No more pain embarrassment discomfort exclusion. Just nothingness. I want rest.
