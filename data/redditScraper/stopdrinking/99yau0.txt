I had hardtime at day one but not after it until day 5 came why? Nothing in day two three etc.. But day 5 bam! Head hurts feeling like going insane without drink and then relapsed..

Don't be too hard on yourself. Alcohol is mean and it's sneaky and if you're struggling to stop it's because this shit is addictive and everywhere. It digs a hole in you then demands you fill it with more alcohol...Keep trying! You can do this!
Get up keep going.  Keep racking up these sober days they all count!! IWNDWYT!
