Last night my husband took me to a beach resort for a last minute trip. I had so many opportunities to take a drink. I even walked up to two bars. It's hard to go to the beach without drinking I am in the habit of using the beach as an excuse to drink. Well the first bar I approached I ordered an ice water instead. The second one I started to get my favorite drink and they said they were closed had just closed five minutes ago at 6pm. Call it what you will but I think God helped me at that moment. I went back to the room and went out to eat a nice sober dinner with my husband and was able to get up for the sunrise feeling fantastic. I can do this! I will NOT drink today.

Good for you but honestly I avoided [bars in early sobriety because](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2szkp8/the_least_popular_advice_dry_people_dry_places/?ref=search_posts) like you I knew the temptation was not worth it even if all I did was come away with a soft drink.
I believe you can absolutely do this! I also agree with /u/coolCrosby that we have to be careful playing with fire so to speak. ..I too have had times where the universe intervened when I absolutely was going to drink for example I was driving home and about to turn left to the liquor store and an ambulance drove by forcing me to pull over to the right. I figured  that was the universe telling me not to drink. So I took that as an opportunity to make sure I was building my support so that I wouldn't get that close again.

Kudos for 6 days! I avoided places where drinking was a main activity in early sobriety. It was too tempting. I will not drink today either. 
It gets easier. I also had to rely on some luck in the first week. Had mentally caved at the grocery store and was about to buy a specific uncommon beer they frequently carried. Luckily for me they were out. I had enough resolve not to get anything (else).  ..I wish it hadn't been such a close call for me and I don't want to have to rely on luck to stay sober because like any gambling eventually the odds don't favor me. Still--you didn't drink and that's a good thing. 
Great job! Is your husband "in" on your sobriety?
