I came across this community some months ago - can tell by the username I created.. struggling to find it in me to stop drinking. Sadly didn't have the courage then to stop. Today I try again. I am 24 hours sober and I feel right now like shit! I want so bad to get up out of my bed and run to the liquor store. Sharp pains in different places I my body. I'm in tears.. trying not to wake my kids up from sobbing.. Can't sleep. Trying to be inspired right now by those of you saying the beginning is hard. Want to make it through to tomorrow...

The beginning can be hard but you are brave.  There is lots of good support here. ..I promise you it gets better.  We have all been through this. 
It'll be worth it. Hang tight 
I was having pains in my liver and stomach although everyone's mileage may differ it tokk around 7-10 days for those pains to go. Nothing in the grand scheme of things. ..I'm glad you're here. You can do this! If you can check out Allen Carr's Stop Drinking Now Easyway and Annie Grace's This Naked Mind. Both excellent reads. 
I just went through hell myself . Seems like each passing day gets better . Lots of hydration  and  just give yourself permission to hide away if you need to . Claim the flu to the kids maybe ??
