*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*....**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**....I'm pledging myself to not drinking today no matter what happens good or bad and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.....It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours let's not drink alcohol!....---....**This pledge is a statement of intent.**....Today we don't set out trying not to drink we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!....What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up.....---....**What this is:**....A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.....**What this isn't:**....A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.....---....This post goes up at:....     US Night/Early Morning....     Europe Morning....     Asia and Australia Evening/Night.... A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar... .. ---....Happy Humpday SD!  Today I thought I'd turn the spotlight on SD itself and look at a typical day in the life of this group.  I took a look at all the posts over the course of one 24-hour period (Monday) and it really confirmed for me what a special place this is.....There were 227 new posts (one every 6 minutes and 20 seconds on average) over the course of that 24 hours with 5446 karma points and 2457 comments/responses (as of the time I counted).  By any standards we are a *very* active and responsive group.  ....On that one day we had 23 'Day 1'/newcomer posts.  That is almost one person each hour choosing SD to help start their journey to sobriety and it doesn't include the number of people who start here without expressly making a Day 1 post.  We had a slightly higher number of people posting that they had recently relapsed and were starting again.  Although we'd all like to shake this demon without any relapse we know that it happens (I certainly do).  Providing a safe and encouraging place for people to work through the bad feelings that often accompany relapse put a new stake in the ground and try again is one of the most important functions we can fulfill in my opinion.....There were 44 posts celebrating a personal sobriety milestone (2 weeks 3 months 100 days 1 year etc.)  One person celebrated their 24th anniversary of sobriety!  Others celebrated making it to Day 2 or Week 2 for the first time in years.  And so many milestones in between.  SD showed up to celebrate them all making sure they each felt rightly proud of the work they were doing.  Because we know how important each step is.....Most touching though were the calls for help from people in a place of despair fear or desperation and reaching out to this group for help.  So many are bravely fighting through incredibly tough issues while trying to make this change. Seeing how readily this community rallied to their side was moving. I usually try to keep my feelings buried but reading through these posts  brought tears to my eyes.  The empathy warmth and generosity that so many of you show here is inspiring.  To paraphrase Jack Nicholson in *As Good As It Gets*: "r/stopdrinking you make me wanna be a better man."....I promise my posts from here on out will be shorter than the last few days. I hope that you're proud of yourselves for being a part of this amazing corner of the internet.  I will not drink with you today.....**Quote of the Day:**..&gt;"I don't want to live in the kind of world where we don't look out for each other. Not just the people that are close to us but anybody who needs a helping hand. I can't change the way anybody else thinks or what they choose to do but I can do my bit."..&gt;*--Charles de Lint*
----------immediate responses--------

Here!
IWNDWYT! (First post to SD finishing up my third day). 
I commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours; thanks for this motivation.
IWNDWYT!
No booze today!
IWNDWYT! Thanks! 
I will not drink with you today
I didn't drink in Aus with you today and I won't tonight!
I will not drink with you today.
Let's celebrate all those minestoles then with not drinking today. Here's to all off you be it your first day sober second a month or maybe even a few years and some days. IWNDWYT 
Without the support of SD I wouldn't of made it past day 1! It's truly life changing. IWNDWYT  
Thank you for your diligent research on this sub glitch-cat! It is really cool to see the #s. Agreed SD is a truly unique and wonderful place. IWNDWYallT.
I went out and while everyone was having a beer I had a seltzer and it felt good. I didn't have to do the mental math of "how many more can I drink before I can too drunk?" I wasn't as social as I am when I do drink but that's something I'm working on being okay with. ..Iwndwyt!
Have a nice wednesday everyone! IWNDWYT
Another fine day in my new alternate universe still glad not to be drinking   
IWNDWYT 
Love the quote of the day! I will remain sober today (April 3 2019) with you beautiful people. It's been a rough start to the week but today is hump day. Stay sober people. You are my world of inspiration.
Good morning and glad to be not drinking with you all today!!! 
Staying sober.
Realized today that I haven't had a drink in April. Going to keep it that way. One day at a time.  
Not drinking with you all today!  I've also cut the coffee down but I'm a tea fanatic.  A proper British cuppa.  So much better than alcohol!  
Great motivation here. IWNDWYT
 IWNDWYT 
Iwndwut
IWNDWYT  
I am grateful to wake up on a misty spring morning looking after a good night's sleep looking forward to the day ahead. I will not drink with you today.
I love this long post today! And I completely agree. This little corner of the internet is helping me stay sober every day. Thank you for sharing! IWNDWYT 
Good morning friends. As per usual: I will not drink with you today... 
Hello all...I will not drink today either. 
Greetings from the UK.Great meeting last night and coming up on day 14. IWNDWYT folks.
Good morning /r/stopdrinking! I hope we're all doing well this Tuesday. I haven't checked in for a wee while whoops - life got busy and on top of me a little bit and I let the daily things slide a wee bit. Still on the wagon still doing grand but it's been a bit tricky over the last few weeks. Finally got some space and time back time to look after myself properly...Doing grand today though and I hope you all are too! IWNDWYT!
Yesterday I attended class sober for the first time in months. And it was an evening class! Let's keep this going :) IWNDWYT
Hey guys!..Feeling physically bad as a result of my drinking but decided I'm NOT gonna beat myself up as long as I'm doing all the right things now (going to the doctors etc). Panic anxiety and guilt aren't gonna help anybody...IWNDWYT
I will not take that first drink today stay strong all
Hit a wall last night. Literally punched my wall while sleeping waking up at 2 am with a bleeding hand. Must have been tense..But I will not drink with you today!..Oh and the professor in my 8am lecture just advocated having a couple drinks the night before the lecture. Otherwise we'd be "missing out" haha...Much love   
I've made it through 11 Days! Never thought this was possible. Went to two baseball games without having a drink! REALLY never thought that was possible!..Today I'll hit an AA meeting and I will not drink!
Every day I don't drink is a milestone to me :) and here's another one! No booze today no booze tonight and I won't be drinking with y'all tomorrow either :).
Still sober
I'm not drinking with you fine people today.
Day 2. Really hoping i can make it to 7. Had a couple of nonalc buds today. Really helped the craving. I know this is gonna be a long road but everytime i try its been getting easier i think. Well see this weekend they are always harder. No more excuses.
Instead of drinking I will work on this every day to avoid slips (Sobriety Losing Its Priority)...IOP today.  Very nearly finished and I do not feel ready.  A couple of months ago I was having to really force myself to go in now I'd happily do another few months...IWNDWYT :)
IWNDWYT
3 months woohooo. Time does indeed fly by after a certain point. I will not drink with you today.
Didnt realize how lonely i was and how i ised drinking to make me not feel it. dont worry though IWNDWYT. It gets better right
Iwndwyt!!!
Not drinking today 
I will stand with you all and not drink today. It's been another rough Day 1 for me here in Tokyo Japan.  But I'm not letting that get in the way of this warm sunny day and the cherry blossoms that begin to drift in the air.    
I will not drink with you today! I'm proud and grateful for working with the sobriety fairy and helping her out as she rests on my shoulder. I won't harm you little one. ..&amp;#x200B;
I won't drink today.
IWNDWYT 
Wonderful summary. Im glad and thankful this sub exist it works wonders. Loved the quote. ..Anxious of going to work today. But I wont let it make me drink! At least not today...
Good mopening! Hope y'all have a wonderful day! IWNDWYT!!
Very cool post u/glitch-cat! Thank you for taking the time to gather that data and putting it all together. I'm very grateful that I chose SD to help me quit drinking this community is awesome :)..I'm not drinking today!
Iwndwyt
I will not drink with you today!
Had a slightly complicated chat with the person I've been seeing about where we're at &amp; what we want last night. Lots of tricky feelings on both sides but hopefully it'll work itself out and talking it through was definitely beneficial. Both parties are prioritising their own wellbeing which is key and at my end that mainly means not drinking and all the lifestyle &amp; attitude changes that come with that...The key thing is that drinking certainly **won't** help solve anything and knowing that is half the battle...Meeting tonight which is good and I suspect will be well-needed and then we're over halfway through the week! Hope everyone has a good hump day &amp; IWNDWYT.
I'm in. IWNDWYT  
No drinking with you today!
IWNDWYT
Today it could hit 62F/17C with sun but winds gusting to 30mph will likely cause trees/wires problems. So I'll be doing my not drinking poison safe at home on my deck today listening to my radio scanners reading a David Baldacci crime-thriller novel and feeding the birdies peanuts. In between doing for my dear Knitwit of course. All in all a great day to be sober and both she and I celebrate on a daily basis my being so.
I will not drink today
Just for today I will join you and stay sober.    
I will not drink with you today! Thank you for hosting u/glitch-kat :)
This group is truly wonderful. IWNDWYT friends 
I will not drink with you today!
Thanks for crunching the numbers u/glitch-cat! It's hard evidence that what happens here in SD is truly remarkable...It's been wonderful here in the Northern Hemisphere to see things starting to bloom - not just for their beauty but also in reminding me that nothing blooms all year round. ..So whether you're blooming or having a blooming hard day I hope you're treating yourself right &amp; IWNDWYT
not drinking today
I will not drink today. I enjoy your personal writings on the Check-in glitch-cat! Don't stop unless you want to. I am proud to be part of this supportive community.
Good morning everyone. Day 60 for me today. I would like to thank you all!!  This site and its members is a great place.  I am so grateful I found it.  IWND  WYT. 
I will not drink with you today! 
IWNDWYT   
I will not drink with you today.
Thank you glitch-cat for such a thoughtful post. Words cannot express how grateful I am for this sub.  IWNDWYT!
 IWNDWYT
This sub is amazing! Thank you u/glitch-cat for pointing it out and that summary. Been in and out of sobriety for 20 YEARS and this sub (just discovered a couple weeks ago) is making a HUGE difference! I go to AA but don't see and hear so much of the people LIKE ME who have relapsed  (often) but want to get sober! I keep going back to AA because 'the only requirement for membership is the desire to stop drinking." On here I've found people who don't judge me!! (Maybe they don't in AA either but I imagine they do). Anyway here's to all of you and in your honor IWNDWYT!! Peace to all. (Plus the fact that I can help someone on their day 1 on here when I am only on my day three just heals me to the core) :)
I will not drink with you today.
Two weeks into my sobriety and feeling better each day. Last time I managed 2 months. I'm really hoping to make it stick this time. Reading William Porter's Alcohol Explained and several other books.. IWNDWYT. 
I will not drink today.
Count me in :)
I will not drink today 
SD is a very special place. ..I will not drink with you today.
I will not drink today.
Second day sober... withdrawals have worn off so feeling fresh eyed but also more cautious as it's always when I feel good that the urges come on strongest. I won't drink today. 
IWNDWYT
I will not drink today.
IWNDWYT!
Made it to day 4. Barely. I will not drink today.
IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT!
IWNDWYT
Starting day3!  IWNDWYT 
Getting easier day by day
I loved reading that analysis glitch-cat. Thank you. .I'm not drinking with you all today!
I will not drink today.
Happy Wednesday! IWNDWYT!
IWNDWYT 
No etoh for me today
Not today. Not today. Not today)!!!!
I'm not drinking today no matter what happens no matter how I feel.
Excellent post! Thank you for gathering the data it is pretty great to read it!! ..No drinking here !
Day 4. Not much to say today except iwndwyt
I will not drink with you today.
I will not drink today. Happy to be here with all of you! 
IWNDWYT 
Not today. 
Not drinking today!
Iwndwyt! Day 3 finally feeling more like myself.
This is day 14. IWNDWYT.
Good morning friends. What a beautiful day. .IWNDWYT! 
IWNDWYT!! 
I will not drink with you today!!
Starting day 3. IWNDWYT! 
IWNDWYT
I am feeling so great lately. I'm almost to my best record by focusing on one day at a time. I will stay free from alcohol today. 
Thank you for the terrific DCI posts this week u/glitch-cat. I personally don't mind the longer posts; it's good to start the day with something that gets me thinking the right way. I especially liked today's topic; it feels really good to be part of such a caring community and your post made me think "What a great world it would be if we could all bring a little of the kindness from SD into . our interactions everywhere else. Let's make it happen!" :-)..IWNDWYT
I will not drink today!
Comrades!  We have sad times.  Among us recovering alcoholics here on r/stopdrinking we have individuals that cannot take the joke that is a proletariat Smurf.  Pray for them because addiction is not their only problem.  Peace love and understanding to all. IWNDWYT 
IWNDWYT
I don't know if I said this but I'm pretty sure I got the job I interviewed for on Monday. This is great wonderful news. ..But I'm scared. Everything I know will be changing soon. I've been a student for 22 years straight. In just over a month I won't be a student anymore. Don't get me wrong all of the changes coming are positive ones - but they're still changes and I'm still so nervous about not knowing who I am and what my role in life will be. ..Anyway. I will not drink with you today. 
Thank you Glitch-cat for taking the time to gather the information for this post! Reading these posts everyday has really helped in my journey for sobriety. If it wasn't for this sub I'm sure I would've tried to moderate my drinking by now. As it stands I'm on day 27 which is my longest stretch of not drinking in quite a few years! It's definitely changed my life! IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT!
IWNDWYT. Because I'm an alcoholic and drinking can kill me
Will not drink today.  
I will not drink today!!!
Hard morning I just want to disappear. But I am still committed to not drinking. IWNDWYT. 
9-6 is how long I slept last night! Yay sober (and exercise) sleep. I will not drink with you today.
IWNDWYT
Good morning SD!..Thanks for the check-in u/glitch-cat......talk about the warm fuzzies!  It's amazing to be part of such support and understanding in a way that can truly be lifesaving.  Aside from my sober husband SD is my safe corner of this booze soaked world and I value all of you! ..Lots of running to do today as 3 of us are sharing a vehicle and 2 have to work.  Such an annoying state of affairs right now but I'm certainly not going to drink about it!..Hang in there my friends!..&amp;#x200B;
I will never regret not drinking today
I won't drink today!
I will not drink with you today   Happy Wednesday everyone!! Stay Strong
Nope no alcohol today thx
I will not drink today!
I won't drink today!
I will not drink with you today!
It was hard not to drink last night with all the stuff I have going on. But I stayed the course and remembered I had a check-in this morning and it really helped to keep me honest. Day 3! IWNDWYT
I will not drink or use with you today!
I will not drink today.
I will not drink with you today.
IWNDWYT 
You're definitely not alone IWNDWYT 
I've been driving at least some alcohol for the past 4 months non stop..I want to give my body a rest..I had wine last night. Just a glass..Today i don't want to drink at all..So I won't. 
This place is great for making me feel supported and less alone...Since you brought up some meta stuff personally I'd love to see more posts from the milestone people talking about the benefits they've noticed. That's what really helps and motivates me. 
One day at a time mode over here...  IWNDWYT!
Hi glitch-cat. Day 3 again. Historically it's been a tough day but I feel fine. I'm going to my new workout classes and a meeting tonight. I will not be drinking today!
IWNDWYT!
I survived day 3 one of my key team members quit yesterday oncology appointment this morning (no reason to panic yet).  So here is the plan: not drinking today. 
It's been a booze-free April and I'm thankful for that. This weekend will be a big challenge (as usual). So I'll check in here frequently and try this one day at a time. See you tonight as I continue Not drinking with you. 
Day 17 over halfway to 30 days! I will not drink with you today 
Happy Wednesday SD! I'm looking forward to another wonderful day of not drinking with you!
no drinking today or the next 24 hrs
One week sober!!! My partner - who quit drinking with me - is going to a concert tonight with a friend. I hope he stays sober. Booze was destroying his health. He has been binge drinking longer than me and has had way more physiological withdrawal than me this past week. Other than that nagging fear Day 8 and feeling great! 
Day seven for me... survived a weekend and a night with my wife out of town. No reason to drink today
IWNDWYT 
Day 4! IWNDWYT   
Will not drink today!
Good morning glitch-cat. I don't know what I would do without SD. Such a great community. I will not drink with you all today. 
That was a fabulous intro Glitch  and a great quote to cap it off. Thanks for that. SD is a truly amazing place. I will not drink with any of you amazing people today.  ..
Thank you so much for the post about this place. No matter the issue in the past I never reached out for help. My drinking was my deepest darkest secret and I told nobody and barely admitted it myself. ..SD was literally the first place I opened up about everything. It took a while but the support and encouragement I got here when being so vulnerable and bearing my soul gave me the strength to tell other people. I now have a month of sobriety thanks to opening up my mind and hear and telling my family and a close friend what I'm going through. I would not have been able too without SD. ..You guys also gave me the encouragement to go to outpatient and AA and dive in despite my reservations. Those places have helped immensely. I'm broadening my support system and am so comfortable sharing my thoughts feelings feats and emotions in those settings. Not just about drinking but about myself. It's made me grow as a person and I'm more confident. ..I've worked my ass off this last month working full time supporting and raising a young family and doing 1-3 hours of meetings and sessions for my rehab every day. Not counting the time of reading journaling and reflection I do on my own. This normally would have exhausted depressed and broken me but it's all been amazing. ..All this is to say SD was the first step (pun intended) in this beautiful transformation I'm making. Thank you all. ..IWNDWYT 
I'm feeling stressed lately with the restrictiveness   of my and SO's diet. So I dreamed a horrible dream which I ended up drinking in. I didn't finish my drink though. I hope that counts for something.    IWNDWYT!! 
I will not drink today.
IWNDWYT 
Checking out a meditation class tonight- looking for new ways to calm my mind. IWNDWYT 
Day 99 for me. Today's Wednesday already? I've been pretty sick lately (running nose achy joints) since Friday and also working a lot earlier than normal which sucks. I was in bed pretty earlier last night though so it's getting better. I will wake up tomorrow with 100 days sober that's pretty cool. IWNDWYT!
Today I need to be here and present for the guy I love. IWNDWYT! 
IWNDWYT happy hump day
 IWNDWYT   Life is getting much easier.
IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT! I have dinner plans with an old friend tomorrow evening feeling nervous about the wine/cocktail list being passed to me. I think I might say "I don't feel well and don't want to drink". What have you said that works for you?
Thank you for crunching the numbers! SD is full of incredible people and does amazing things for people every day. I love you all and will not drink with you today!
Good morning from California!  Thanks for the data glitch-cat.  It truly affirms what we feel.....this is a special place no doubt about it.  Day 61.  Was out on a day trip with the husband yesterday.  Got home and we were tired and hungry.  And my lizard brain said  sit down!  Have a glass of wine and relax...... .  That feeling really lasted only a few minutes.  Had a bite to eat and a lacroix and everything was right again.  Scary sometimes how those feelings rear up.  It was the strongest craving I've had in awhile.   In my mind I said  back off bitch. Get back in your cage.   Gigi is running the show.  Good people of SD IWNDWYT   Gigi 
I Will not drink with you today! 
Happy Wednesday! So happy to have made it through Monday and Tuesday and to keep it up today. Here's to sober day number 3! IWNDWYT
Thank you for the research you did glitch-cat!  I was curious about some of what you discovered.  I really wouldn't be trying so hard to quit this poison if it wasn't for this group.  I am reminded why it is so important and what the alternative is if I don't quit.  I also feel heartened when I read stories of those who have been where I am and got themselves out of it.  IWNDWYT

Today I am making a conscious decision not to drink any alcohol. IWNDWYT!
I will not drink today!
IWNDWYT!!!!
IWNDWYT!
I did it! I didn't drink last night and I woke up sober. I've been on this endless cycle of resetting and binging and I finally broke that streak! Another day! Here we go! I will not drink today.
Good morning SD! I have to drag myself to work it has been 3 days of feeling like death warmed up. But I am sober and I believe I am recovering much faster then I would had I been drinking leading up to this cold! Onward! IWNDWYT!
Starting day 10! Love seeing those double digits. IWNDWYT! 
I will not drink today. 
Sober today with all of you!
Good morning sober friends. Thanks glitch-cat...those numbers are inspiring...I am proud to be a part.  "If a man is called to be a streetsweeper he should sweep streets even as Michelangelo painted or Beethoven composed music or Shakespeare wrote poetry."--Martin Luther King Jr. I am grateful today that whatever I do I will do it to the best of my ability. I went a long long time doing as little as possible just to get by. I will NOT drink with you today! Peace
Thanks for taking the time to make that analysis. Super cool. I'll say til the day I die that SD saved my life. ..I won't let ethanol win today and I see I'm in good company. IWNDWYT!
I went out to dinner last night for the first time since I quit 3/26 and I didn't even look at their cocktail menu! :) IWNDWYT 
Good morning world! Yesterday marked 4 weeks! Second time in my life...IWNDWYT 
I will NOT drink with any of you wonderful people today!  Plus I can't believe it's Wednesday already.... where did the week go?!
I will not drink with you today. 
3 days in a row up at 8am! Unheard of  ..Still not quite perfected getting up and being productive immediately but it beats sleeping in til the afternoon most days! ..IWNDWYT 
Trying to stay consistent with a routine is leading me back to bliss although I need to get more sleep I think. IWNDWYT 
I told you brain  ! Not today.
Thank you u/glitch-cat for this post and that quote. When I consider the endless needs of others I find my focus again. Thanks for all of that.
Not today!       
IWNDWYT!  
I will not drink with you today ! I have far to much to do and far to much to lose.  
Day 3! IWNDWYT.  
Hi SD ..today I am doing intermittent fasting and IWNDWYT!..Last night I went to a fancy restaurant with my friend which I chose because they have good MOCKtails! Had a blast and didn't miss the booze.
Hi SD!..&amp;#x200B;..Today I am doing intermittent fasting and IWNDWYT!!..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;
Good morning.  IWNDWYT 
I will not drink today. 
So today I didn't have much to do for work so instead of sitting at home day drinking I signed up to help with a recruiting event for my company. Going well and then planning on going to the gym afterwards! IWNDWYT!
Day 185 of not drinking. IWNDWYT 
IWNDWYT! 
Let's do this thing!
iwndwyt
Love love LOVE this post!! And I love r/stopdrinking. Everyone has each other's backs and the level of compassion and understanding is awe-inspiring. This has got to be one of the most supportive places on the internet. .I've almost reached my first short term goal of 4 weeks and IWNDWYT!
5 months here!! Its incredible the change my mental health went through over these months. I didnt realise how much drinking affected my mentality even during the couple days in between where I wouldn't drink. I realise now abstaining from it how much of an issue alcohol was for me. I'm so happy to have found this group and be here :) ..One thing that has truly helped me when I cannot avoid social drinking outings is soda water or kombucha. If I'm at home I'll put it in a champagne glass to make it a special thing! I also have taken CBD oil when I feel especially anxious to help calm me as that seems to be one of the core reasons I drank. Thank you for reading x ..I will not drink with you today!! 
I will not drink today. 
IWNDWYT    
IWNDWYT!  Day 3 already  feeling hopeful because of SD!
This is my day 3! IWNDWYT!
Day 4. I will not drink with you all today!!
Happy Wednesday. Just for today I will not drink with you...Solo por hoy no beber  contigo..Juste pour aujourd'hui je ne boirai pas avec vous..Sicut est hodie ut non bibam vobiscum....
Today is a good day I woke up confident I am making the right choice for my family and for myself. Today is a new day..And today I will NOT be drinking 
Celebrating 2 years today. IWNDWYT! 
IWNDWYT   
Hello from Kansas City MO USA.  I won't drink with you today 
IWNDYT!
Yup SD is pretty great.  Wouldn't be in a support group without it.  I think its cool that some people use SD as their only support group and it works for them.  IWNDWYT!
I will not drink with you on this lovely sunny Pittsburgh day!
I will not drink with you today.
Great quote thanks...By not drinking today I will be in a better position to do my bit. 
I will not drink with you today!
It seems like every sit-down place with a lunch special includes alcohol in the price but I am having an iced tea instead. ..I will not drink today!
I will not drink with you today 
Creeping up on day 3 which is when I usually start to feel some cravings. Today feels different so intending to keep it clean. Iwndwyt

Day 10 checking in. IWNDWYT
Heck yes! Tonight will make ONE WEEK!! I'm very proud of myself. I haven't gone more than a week in over 5 years! ..Last night was really tough but I am so happy I didn't give in and feel so much better for it. Falling asleep is still really tough but I'd rather know what time I fell asleep how I got into bed and remember what I ate for dinner. I chose not to drink myself into a restless sleep...Other than strong evening cravings and trouble sleeping I think I am over the toughest side of the physical withdrawal. Now it's time to really take care of the mental aspect. ..Thank you all so much for helping me get to this point! I honestly cannot believe I really got to a full week. I truly don't think I would have even gotten passed day 3 without this sub...IWNDWYT.    
Good morning Glitch-cat.  What a great tribute to our SD community. Every day IO think how grateful I am to the SD family.  ..I finally got to see my doctor about the chest pains Ive been getting.  Thankfully he says its not a cardiac event (which I feared) but a combination of acid reflux and stress.  He said I need to deal with the stress "to take the edge off".   I laughed because this was the primary cause and justification for my drinking.  He suggested citalopram (Celexa) and I'm considering.  Would love to hear if anyone has taken this.  (Im going to post as well).   ..Despite the stress Im not tempted to drink   .  I'd rather be present and anxious than numbed and depressed.  
I will not drink with you today!

Biked to work today because it's finally nice enough. Going to do laundry when I get home and try to go for a run. Also going to get some kombucha to drink. Should be a good night.

A month ago I was terrified I could not even get this far...But here I am. The longest I have gone in 16 years. ..Thank you all at SD. Daily check ins have been a life saver. ..IWNDWYT 
I know this is the completely wrong thread but I feel like you guys would offer some help. I've been smoking weed everyday since I was graduated from highschool. I'm a productive member of society but I'd really like to find a community like this one to help me stop smoking weed. I honestly can't do it on my own..I couldn't find a thread like this for quitting weed but I could really use a hand as I'm sure you know quitting is hard to do alone ..Thanks

IWNDWYT 
Today I bought a 20$ body wash. Crazy. But I felt like doing getting something that's roughly what I would have spent on alcohol if I was drinking. It smells fantastic and I took a bath and am ready for bed completely sober. 
Day one: redo. IWNDWYT!!
IWNDWYT 
5 days to go... April 8th and 1 year alcohol free are almost here! IWNDWYT
I will not drink today. I will give my body a break. I will not have a drink with you! 1st time. Determined 
Late to check in yet again but I didn't drink on this fine Wednesday! I'll try my darndest to check in early tomorrow.   And yes this is a special place we have here. It just might be the kindest corner of the internet.
So very new to this sub but wow I love reading through the check ins from all 'round the world as well as the great positive spirit and encouragement! Thanks for being a wonderful place.
I will not drink with you today.
