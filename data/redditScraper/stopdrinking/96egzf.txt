I love being able to shower every day. My hygiene was disgraceful towards the end of my drinking. I love not waking up in a pool of cold sweat every day (although I did today because of a scary relapse dream). I love being there for the people in my life. I love waking up before mid afternoon even though my sleep cycle is still fucked. I love being able to read. I love not having to do reconnaissance on the night before. I love being able to dress well instead of throwing on whatever's left. What a relief to be able to do these simple little things.

Isn't it all amazing!  One day at a time.  Good for you.  Thanks for posting!
Yesterday was chaos. Today is order. Tomorrow will be magic.
Yes quite agree it's the simple things in life that we once neglected that we now appreciate.  IWNDWYT!
   
An *Unimpaired Life*!
Yes to all those things. A silly thing I'm enjoying is staying up late because my move was always to drink wine until I couldn't keep my eyes open and usually go to bed by 9. I did LAUNDRY and bought TOILET PAPER before the last roll even ran out!
