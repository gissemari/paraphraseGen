Went to lunch today and when I drank I would always have a few beers at lunch enough to make me hate the rest of the day.  I felt the urge to pull over and get some wings and three big IPA's.  I didn't do it!  I feel this time I might actually make it..:)

Congrats! That is incredible. Especially avoiding the wings though...damn I love me some wings.
Congrats but I don't understand your title here. Just my own opinion by I hate seeing titles that imply someone struggled and relapsed and then find it was just clickbait. ..Happy to hear about you success today though!
Good.  Knocking down the pull of a craving like this is a huge step forward.  Keep resisting the urge it gets easier.
Sorry I just felt relapse pulling at me.  A habit was going to lunch and drinking.  Sometimes I would goto lunch and say "im not drinking at lunch" but still would drink.  Today I ate lunch and didn't!  I didn't goto a restaurant or pub either so that helped.
