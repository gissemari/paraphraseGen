I feel so dumb because I've been so confident that I don't want to drink and I list off my reasons why but right now the struggle is pretty rough. ...I want to drink a cold beer and just relax beyond the relax I've been feeling lately...I've been doing good with staying busy and excersizing to wear myself out but for some reason it's so difficult at this moment. ..I've gone back and forth with this thought like ten times already. Help!

How will you feel tomorrow morning if you give in tonight?..How will you feel if you reset your badge?..It's not you struggling...  it's the beast within begging to be fed. If you visualize it can you tame it?..Be strong! IWNDWYT!
Whew. Thank you. I'm reaching out on all sides to friends so I think I'll make it through this. Just so crazy how strong the cravings can come. Wasn't expecting this. I can't wait until I just don't even care about alcohol anymore. 
HALT: are you Hungry Angry Lonely or Tired? Address those possibilities and then play the tape forward!
I was definitely hungry and feeling kind of like my inner boozer was pissed that I am doing this for good. 
Hi SpecialK you're probably ok for tonight already I just wanted to pop in to say it's a good idea to keep expecting the unexpected.  These things spring on us out of the blue until we've fought them all from every angle.  Alcohol is cunning baffling and powerful.  It only holds as much power as we feed it though thank all the gods!  That means it'll run out of juice.  Keep on keeping on girl you can do this!  I will not drink with you any time you want!     Hug!  Good win tonight 
Thanks so much Fish! You're the best.
