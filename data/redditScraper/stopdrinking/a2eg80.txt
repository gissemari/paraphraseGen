So happy and grateful to be up early on a beautiful Southern California morning feeling well sober no hangover no remorse. .Had a very difficult and challenging experience Friday night at my wife's holiday party. Open bar good food loud music everyone drinking most drinking heavily. They were all having a great time while I was struggling. I made it through without drinking anything but it was very very hard. FranklyI was very surprised at how much I was suffering particularly towards the end of the night. Really started thinking that maybe it's better that I drink on these occasions so not to be in such a funk. .Still thinking about that proposition but glad I didn't give in. Certainly not ready to give up on this feeling of sobriety and wellness. .I will make it through the holidays without drinking.

That's sounds torturous.  It would have been hard for me not to give in to the temptation.  But having to start over is even harder. ..You did great.  Enjoy your day...IWNDWYT
To be honest I still struggle with this...I'm not the same fun vibrant outgoing person I used to be...Of course I'm also not all the negatives that come towards the end of the night...But I really avoid all social functions because of this..It's certainly not sustainable so I'm not sure where to go from here.
