I'm 19 years of age and I know that I have so much potential but my SO thinks that going to *get treatment for cancer* is confirmation that I am in fact a failure."...Sounds a bit different now doesn't it?..If you were sick with cancer going to the doctor to get treatment would be the thing to do.  It would literally save your life.  This is **no different.**  Your life is in danger and if your boyfriend thinks saving your life isn't worth it then he *isn't worth you.*..What do you do?  Go to rehab.  Go for a few weeks.  Go for a few months if you need it.  If your boyfriend isn't waiting for you when you come out then that's what I'd call a "win-win.".....  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|28|2|SarahSiddonscooks|*What is your most surprising learning from being alcohol free?* by Theunimpossibles|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/25xpxp/what_is_your_most_surprising_learning_from_being/chlpuoq)|.Like it or not here it comes....I had many short bursts of sobriety over the last 15 years or so none lasting any longer than 90 days so a lot of things that returned I already knew. BUT I was told several years ago that because of my alcoholism I was peri menopausal I only had a cycle once every 6 months if that. Next week I have 9 months sobriety and I will also be 6 months pregnant. ...  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|27|2|wuckfork|*Today is day one.

About nine months into sobriety I realised that the inevitable sadnesses of life were no longer plunging me into a pit of suicidal despair.

My biggest surprise was that I *didn't* enjoy many of the benefits of quitting in the months after I quit. I did not magically lose weight. My libido was still lower than it should have been. I didn't always wake up feeling great and my head was still sometimes foggy...In some cases alcohol was covering other root problems that I still had to deal with: for example I wasn't making good choices about food and tended not to get enough sleep. Without alcohol in my life I was in a much better position to correct these issues. But they didn't just disappear when I put down the bottle...I guess my message is don't expect miracles to shower down on you. Giving up alcohol will remove one of the biggest obstacles you face toward a better life but you're still going to have to put in the work.....  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|24|1|TacticalBurrito|*I was sober for 381 days. 381.

To me it was a huge source of guilt and shame which mostly led to more drinking to try to bury those feelings...The thing is you're not *losing* anything. Your year of sobriety still happened; that experience is not invalidated or trivialized or made meaningless by a relapse. Everything you've accomplished and everything you've learned in that time is still with you...And I feel you on the lost love anguish buddy....  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|24|1|themaincop|*Reading a number of relapse posts this morning.* by in4real|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/25xxuv/reading_a_number_of_relapse_posts_this_morning/chlyc80)|.I heard a similar one on here: "I wish I could drink like a normal person I'd do it every day!"...  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|22|0|eddie964|*An insight into my world: I think I found the most succinct way to tell people why I don't drink.* by greatmainewoods|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/26amwx/an_insight_into_my_world_i_think_i_found_the_most/chpasss)|.I keep it simple: "I don't drink." Adding "anymore" invites the obvious question and puts you in an awkward position if you don't want to answer it...If you just say "I don't drink" it usually stops the conversation dead -- the vast majority of people care about as much about your drinking habits as they care about whether you like broccoli. Answering like this also puts the social onus on the other person who now must ask the awkward question: "Why not?" Most people (not all) will correctly identify that as overly forward and move on to something else...When people ignore the social cues I usually make up something that's obviously bullshit. If they press I usually end the conversation. (I might make exceptions for attractive women.) ..Mind you I'm not ashamed of what I am. But if you don't know me well enough to know that I don't drink then chances are it's none of your damned business. I'd react the same way if a stranger asked me about my religious beliefs (up here in New England we don't wear that on our sleeves like they do down south) or my mother's favorite brand of douche....  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|21|4|DiscordDuck|*Funny analogy I heard in AA* by BlicerosBlackBox|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/267mv7/funny_analogy_i_heard_in_aa/chofoj0)|.Only problem with that is that you generally don't see loads of people eating cat food while you abstain. ;) Sorry that mental image popped into my head and it made me laugh....  ..  ..---.^this ^report ^was ^automatically ^generated. ^contact ^/u/offtherocks ^with ^problems.
