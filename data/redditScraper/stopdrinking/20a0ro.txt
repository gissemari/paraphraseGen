I'm not big on tattoos but that's a pretty cool tattoo.
Cool. I love programming and recursion plus I am a recovery alcoholic so I really like it. I want one.
It's geeky scientific and accurate. I love it.
That is indeed pretty damn cool. .I was thinking about getting the words ' The first will be your last' on my right hand index finger at one point. Just so I had to see it as I took a drink...if I drank again. Now I'm thinking hand tattoos are slightly extreme. 
Love it. I'm not a tattoo fan either but that's geeky cool. 
No fan of tattoos (have you seen most of those things after 40 years?) but the symbolism's meaning to you is another thing. Congrats for thinking ..
I like this too... I'd consider it for myself actually and I have no tattoos.
Pretty cool. I'm the same way when it comes to having drinks. Or at least I was. One turns into two turns into three..etc. etc..keep up the good work!
I know you said "new tattoo" which kinda implies that you have more but.....Is this your first?
This is great! Congratulations on 9 days!..I have 11 months today and am also a fan of recursion and - now - your blog. I got two new tattoos after about 6 months clean that mean something to my recovery. One of them is on the veiny side of my left wrist so I see it constantly. It's one of the most helpful tools I have...Keep it rockin'.
I love it!  Best of luck to you!  
Why did I click on that? shameless self promotion could've just put a imgur link.
Ah yes the spiraling out of control sequence. Nice
