I have been thinking of drinking a lot the past week. I'm not sure if it's the holidays and stress or what but it's been hard. But I still feel way better with this feeling than the one after I have to reset my badge or apologize to people or nurse a day-long hangover. I feel so much better than that so IWNDWYT.

Hang in there! Two more days and you'll hit triple digits! What an awesome accomplishment :) I plan to be where you are in 90ish days. 
Right here with you! Post rings true for me too. See you at 100
Do just hang in there. It doesn't change quickly but bit by bit it does get better. I am the least optimistic person in the world and even I can feel it getting better bit by bit. Way to go on almost-100! That's a serious chunk of time.
Horray for you!!!!    
Hang in there! 100 days right .. there.. you can do it! I will not drink with you tonight!
