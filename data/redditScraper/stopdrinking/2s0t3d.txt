I'm very thankful I found this subreddit. Also thankful that I'm not out there anymore. I've been lurking for a month or so and decided to jump in. I see a part of me in everyone's story. I've struggled with sobriety and alcoholism for over 35 years. For you folks that have been able to string together some time I can assure you that it still sucks out there. Withdrawls were extremely difficult this time. I'm fortunate to have a supportive 81 y/o mother my loving children and grandchildren a couple of close friends and a great psychiatrist. The last time I was sober lasted for six years. Then a run of some really shitty and unfortunate luck culminating with the death of my father sent me over the edge. That was nine years ago. In closing I can't believe I'm not dead. I look forward to sharing and reading your posts advice tears and joy for many year to come. Thanks for listening. Yours in sobriety BRM

It's pretty nuts how much similarity there is in most of our stories isn't it?..Glad you're here grab a badge from the sidebar.
As disheartening as it is to a guy with just a few weeks under his belt to hear that a guy can have so many years before CLUNK.... glad you are here. I've done a few other things to make this time stick for me but this community has been a god send. Unlike meetings it's here AT ANY MINUTE that I want to log on from anywhere. Pass an old haunt and feel an itch that has me in the parking lot... pull out the iPhone and go to SD new submissions and I'm suddenly pulling back out onto the road without ever having left the car. Welcome. 
Glad you're back among us here is better.
Welcome Home. .
Thanks for the warm welcome folks. Just for today I will not drink.
