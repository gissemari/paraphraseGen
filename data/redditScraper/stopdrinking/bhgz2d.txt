Today is 4 weeks or 28 days. I think since last February when I relapsed after close to 3 years sober through the miracle of AA I've gotten to this point maybe twice? ..The difference between those times and now is that I was isolated not going to meetings and generally just feeling miserable...This time around I've cut out some toxic people in my life I've made a point of hanging around people in AA who are my age and who I can relate to and I've been going to more meetings. I've also been exercising specifically jogging late at night. I am training for a 10KM run next month with my family...Usually I go to meetings with or where I meet people who I can go for fellowship afterwards with. Fellowship is sometimes as helpful or more helpful than a meeting. I need to feel connected to other alcoholics and be able to talk about things and I am not big on sharing in meetings (I have sometimes crippling social anxiety which makes it hard for me to do readings or speak in front of large groups). I am still working on getting a sponsor...&amp;#x200B;..A few months ago I felt utterly hopeless and was thinking about how I could go about killing myself (something I had never seriously considered before). I am so thankful I never acted on this. ..I know that the next steps for me include getting a sponsor and continuing to attend meetings and continuing to reach out to others in AA who I can spend time with outside of the rooms. ..I know my 3 years sober isn't lost because of my extended relapse and for now I am just focussing on making it through each day and finding productive spiritual things to improve my life...I also attended a Refuge Recovery meeting this week. I am going to continue to go to this meeting once a week along with AA. Unfortunately there's not a lot of RR meetings offered near me but I really like the Buddhist spiritual approach...Thanks for reading. IWNDWYT
