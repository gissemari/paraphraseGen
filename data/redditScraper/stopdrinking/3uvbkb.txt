Now I am having conversations with myself rationalizing why it's OK to do today - and struggling to not drink. This weekend I lost. I binged. I searched online for AA meetings but am struggling to find something. Is there a site or somewhere I can go to see where there are meeting locations/times so that I can find one that fits my schedule ?..Thanks all :)
