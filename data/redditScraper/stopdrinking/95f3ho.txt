Good evening SD. Hope my fellow sobernauts have had a good day. It is the end of Day 16 for me and I am sober. My energy levels are up as I've been eating more than usual. No afternoon nap for me today. Went for a power walk at the beach this evening and instead of returning straight home after it I spent two hours on the sandy beach. It has been a long time since I did that. I even waded into the sea for a while and it was surprisingly warm. When I was drinking I lost sight of the simple pleasures in life. Tonight as I lay on the beach listening to the waves and feeling the sun and breeze on my face I felt a good deal of gratitude. Sober I can be present and able and willing to take the time to appreciate the beauty of things around me. Drunk I was oblivious to everything. Anyhow each sober day brings with it a new revelation. Sending you all best wishes especially those of us still struggling:-)
