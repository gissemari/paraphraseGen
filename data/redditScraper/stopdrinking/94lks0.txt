Greetings sobernauts! I hope you have had a good sober Saturday. It is the end of Day 13 and I am sober. The day got off to a bad start. I received an email from an acquaintance that upset me. In early sobriety still my emotions are not perfectly balanced and I had to fight the urge to dwell on it. Reason being? I know from experience that resentment and anger are dangerous emotions to harbour because they can lead to relapse. So I took a deep breath and pushed those thoughts and feelings aside waited 10 hours and responded to the email in a gracious manner. It's important for me to learn anew how best to deal with the ups and downs of life without drinking alcohol in order to cope with negative feelings and circumstances. Today was a breakthrough for me on that score. Keeping plugged in to this sub today and reading your amazing posts has helped me through a difficult time. I'm  so grateful to SD. Sending you all best wishes especially those of us still struggling:-)
