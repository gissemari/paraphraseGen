It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Struggle:** Having MS is a real bitch....**Triumph:** A few days ago I went to a hearing concerning disability income because of my MS... Are you still not drinking alcohol?  the judge asked me from up on her bench. I was startled because the hearing was about my MS and alcohol had nothing to do with it... Yes Your Honor. Still not drinking  I told her. I realized that she must have seen all of my medical records including the one with the diagnosis of alcoholic cirrhosis... When did you quit?  she asked smiling... May of 2015  I told her... And the liver transplant? .. I don't need it any more Your Honor. .. Excellent! Great job  she told me and I was **SO PROUD.**...**General:** I thought the phrase  hot mess  was modern but apparently it goes back to the nineteenth century like the following printed in a newspaper in January 1899:..&gt;I say if [the public] would only stop to consider this before forming an opinion perhaps the wage-earners might win; but no they believe everything they see in the newspapers. If the newspaper says the sky is painted with green chalk that is what goes. Verily I say unto you the public is a hot mess. ..Sadly when I was drinking I was not a hot mess. I was just a mess...
----------immediate responses--------

**Struggle**: my dad just put a bunch of beer in the fridge. Leinenkule and Summit. Used to be two of my favorite brands. The idea of "just having a couple" keeps popping into my head but it's slippery slope that I'm sitting on top of and I don't want to take even one step down...**Triumph**: I seem to be able to eat peanuts again. I have Ulcerative Colitis and this is a huge victory for me. My large intestine has been in a dire condition for years and my streaks of not drinking have given it a chance to heal. Maybe if I keep going with not drinking I can recover fully...**General**: I just started a new job recently. Its nice to be employed again and I'm glad to be earning money but I'm not really enjoying it. It's not in the industry that I want to work in and I'm having trouble fully applying myself.
One thing I'd like to share with everyone here is a great book I'm reading entitled "Sixty Meters to Anywhere" by Brendan Leonard. In this memoir Leonard shares what led him to sobriety a glimpse at his drinking life and the process by which he reinvented himself. He became a journalist and a mountain climber and fusing those interests an outdoor writer and blogger who shares his love of climbing in various magazines and books. There's a lot of "quit lit" out there but for those of you interested in the restorative power of nature I recommend this book. https://www.amazon.com/Sixty-Meters-Anywhere-Brendan-Leonard-ebook/dp/B01E9MBNSM.
**Struggle:** Upper respiratory infections are no fun. Can definitely tell my body is still adjusting after my 30 day relapse!..**Triumph:** At midnight I'll be 14 days sober. I feel much much better about where I'm at with my decision not to drink this time around. I feel like a completely different person when I'm drinking and when I'm sober. I believe in myself sober. I'm more social sober. I care more about others sober. 2 weeks!..**General:** I really wish I could get into meditation. My mind really races and would love to get the benefits of calm/peace/clarity. I'm always rushing too and from work taking 10 minutes to meditate is hard!!
Struggle: Loneliness. Throughout the course of the last 6 months I've lost the majority of my close friends and split with my partner of 4 years. Nothing happened really. Things just sort of... fell apart. People moved across the country. I moved to a new house. I am overworked and don't have a lot of time for folks. A lot of the friends I do have that I know would want to spend time with me are very boozy people and I'm trying to avoid that. But I'm sick of going to work (where I often work alone) coming home making dinner reading and going to bed. I'm sick of sleeping alone. Holy shit I didn't realize how true that was until I typed it -- I'm really sick of sleeping alone. .Triumph: My two days badge doesn't really state it because of a recent slip up but I've been doing much much better not drinking -- very specific and gross triumph: Solid poops..General: Learning how to braze metal-work and use an Oxy-Acetylene torch!
Struggle: I have been getting anxiety when I think about giving up alcohol forever...Triumph: I'm back on track to losing the weight I've gained from drinking &amp; binge-eating from drinking. Already lost a couple of pounds this week. ..General: I'm so ready for baseball season! Opening day is so close! :) 
**Struggle:** Refat.  I'm back to where I was when I quit drinking. At least I didn't gain any weight during quitting smoking.  Still it sucks...**Triumph:** I'm finally dealing with an on-going health issue.  I got a CT scan and should get surgery soon.  The med tech asked me how long I have been suffering and why I decided to finally do something about it.  Sober = better adulting...**General:** Spring is here!  I'm really looking forward to gardening.  I've been pretty depressed without it.
Struggle: some colleagues (women) were talking about wine vodka and beer yesterday. I watched myself throwing everything overboard slowly and even asking "who wants to have one tonight?" crossed my mind...Triumph: I was conscious about my mind shift which saved me. What triggered me was not just the alcohol but the idea of having some female company combined with the 'good times' in a bar setting instead of arriving in an empty home. The keyword here: loneliness.
Struggle: I've been through a handful of job interviews the last few weeks for some really amazing opportunities and keep coming in second best to other candidates. I got a call back for a second interview at the start of this week but have still not heard anything so I guess I've not been successful this time either. Trying not to take it personally as I work in a hugely competitive field but it's starting to wear me down a bit...Triumph: I've been working really hard on my fear of public speaking this year and think I am finally starting to see an improvement. I will probably always be anxious about it but it's beginning to feel like a manageable anxiety rather than the all consuming terror it once was...General: seriously cannot wait for the 4 day Easter weekend! Boyfriend &amp; I have booked a cottage on the coast and are planning lots of walks etc.

Struggle: ruined my back lifting objects now I can't move my neck. Looking sideways is hard!..Triumph: I have resisted the urge to drink or take drugs to ease the pain!..General: been listening to the Sandy B AA YouTube series on the way to work every day and picked up a lot of good stuff. I recommend to anyone really starts the day off well.
I hope that conference works out in your favor u/sfgirlmary! &lt;3..**Struggle:**     My estranged sister/BIL/nephew are coming to me and Mom's for Easter. We haven't spoken in months. I know that I must take a stand for myself and be there though. ..**Triumph:**     I bit the bullet and went full speed ahead with the new job yesterday. I still think it's complex as hell but I'm going to give it my best. I was however pleasantly surprised by the warm welcoming messages from my old and new colleagues...**General:**     I've discovered a new happiness: last night K daughter and I ordered in Chinese lounged around cozily in the living room and watched Modern Family together - we laughed so hard and had so much fun! Life would never be this good if I was still drinking!.
**struggle** I went to my psychiatrist yesterday to discuss pregnancy with the medication I am on for bipolar disorder. I've tried several types of medicine in the past including lithium (which is save for pregnancy) and nothing worked as good as the one I am currently on. Anyway long story short the medicine I am on now is harmful for a fetus. There are options; switching to low doses of antipsychotics (but they make me gain like crazy and I already gained 15kgs due to medication) or trying without meds (which scares me because I am so happy to finally not feel suicidal and unstable and I am very scared to go back). I am 34 and even though my psychiatrist assured me I still have time I don't feel like I have many years to try out new medication. Also because I need to be stable for quite some time before me and my husband can make such an important decision like bringing a new human into this world. ..**triumph** I haven't had a drink in over a month am doing great at work and I am more than ever motivated to take care of myself. Becoming serious about our wish for children was my number 1 motivator to get healthy and I am even more motivated to giving it my all...**general** I look forward to the long Easter weekend...IWNDWYT.
Struggle: 10 days into giving up smoking and the struggle is REAL. Not so much not to smoke but more not to eat everything in my path...Triumph: this is the longest I have been clean of booze and cigs for over 10 years...General: I have a crush on a colleague of mine even though he is not my usual type. He has a crush on me too. He also has a girlfriend. Sigh.
Struggle: I have two big things that I'm working on right now: my thesis and studying for a national language competency test that I have to pass in order to stay in the country where I'm living. My entire life is here - my friends work studying my serious relationship I would be devastated if I had to leave and return home. I don't feel 100% ready for the test and it is in a week and a half so I am kinda freaking out about that...Triumph: I almost have a week sober just have to make it through today. This morning I woke up at 9:00 earliest in a while! I feel more energy coming my way and it's exciting...General: Someone told me to watch Criminal Minds because it was creepy. At first I was disappointed because it seemed like any other murder mystery series (which is my guilty pleasure anyway so it was fine) but now I've started binge watching it and when you watch 6 episodes a day the creepiness starts getting to you!..IWNDWYT :) 
Struggle: have been feeling stuck for weeks can't see where my life is going feeling extreme tiredness and so so flat. ..Triumph: still sober...General: trying to trust the process and believe I'm in the right path. I have to be because I don't want to drink anymore so there is no going back. I just don't know the way forward yet. 
**Struggle:** I'm currently having the worst period of interrupted sleep and insomnia that I can remember. I am still sort of sleeping but I'm also waking up feeling absolutely awful. I'll feel tired all morning and then finally wake up around 4pm and then by around midnight I can't sleep!..**Triumph:** I cycled to and from work yesterday for the first time in a few weeks after having injured my knee ligaments. Planning to do the same today even though it's raining. I love cycling...**General:** I need to read books again. I could never concentrate on a plot or take in dialogue while drinking. I've got such a backlog that the stack of books waiting for space on a shelf is almost as high as one of my shelves. And that's not even considering all the books on my kindle that I haven't read...
Struggle: I'm finding it hard to deal with my emotions and find myself going numb. An ex reached out last night and we talked for a long time but I always get those bittersweet memories and miss how things used to be for us. We talk as friends on and off because usually I end up drunken spilling my guts on how he's the worst or why I'm still in love with him. For the first time I was sober. It threw me off and the whole time I wanted a drink because I couldn't understand what I was feeling. It's been hard navigating my emotions and this was a curveball I'm not sure I was ready for...Triumph: I had to turn in homework past the deadline due to a website glitch and typically I would just ignore it and not deal with it but I sat down in a quiet room and chipped away at it and gave real thought to the assignments. My professors have been commenting on how I seem to be improving in class and to keep doing whatever I'm doing...General: I am really looking forward to the summer or at least weather that doesn't require a jacket. I miss sitting out in the sun and I'm pale as can be. It's finally warming up but of course instead of snow it's rain. I guess it's the right track though! Plus I lost almost 100 lbs since last summer I'm ready to show off!!
Struggle: I've been dealing with a lot of unnecessary stress at work. The boss expects so much out of me but it feels like other employees can just came and go as they please and do a half ass job and nothing gets said or done about it. It's really been testing my patience...Triumph: I recently got back into running and it feels really good to be back at it. It's the perfect way to blow off some steam and I always feel better after I'm done...General: can't wait to get to my folks for Easter weekend. Neither of them drink so I won't have to worry about being tempted by having alcohol around and Saturday morning I'm hitting the lake with my pops and we're spending the morning fishing. 
Struggle: my eating patterns. I went on vacation and ate like my life depended on I t for a week. Seriously kept eating and couldn't stop. The weeks leading up to I t it'd been restricting heavily and losing weight quickly. When I got back I gained some weight back and now I m finding myself taking on the challenge of restricting as much as possible again. I've had food cycles like this before in high school it's just weird how much pleasure I get out of restricting food and I know that I t is not healthy. As well as binge eating for the 7 days before. It's like  the all or nothing  Approach which quickly turned me into an alcoholic. I have the same unhealthy relationship with food and exercise. I need to find a happy medium. I m just not sure how yet...Triumph: 126 days man. Life's pretty fucking amazing and i can't believe I have friends now..General: it's kind of fun challenging myself to do one extra mundane task each day that will benefit  later me  like making my bed nicely and being able to come home to it. 
Struggle: not much but wine and beer can look good when on vacation. It can be hard to say no thanks...Triumph: i can do hard things...General: traveling in the american south i am fascinated by the durability of culture. 
Struggle: where has my motivation gone? Everything seems hard. ..Triumph: still pushing forward...Other: I am almost at 100 days. Never thought I'd be here.

**Struggle:** I fell off the wagon about three weeks in in January. Tried right after but didn't make it..**Triumph:** I'm back.
**Struggle** SO seems so negative to me. I'm trying so hard to be happy in this short life and he's always grumpy doesn't like anything always bored but won't try anything new. And IMO he doesn't appreciate me properly in a lot of ways. ..**Triumph** Continued sobriety and health. ..**General** Nothing but chilly or downright cold and wintry weather as far out as the forecast goes. I think I'd be in a better mood if it would warm up to where it at least stayed consistently above freezing for a while. 
I won't 
Struggle: My wife is still unemployed desperately looking for work at this point me not drinking is greatly helping our finances however...Triumph: I've gotten in some form of exercise 9 of the past 11 days and am down about 4lbs only 2 more until BMI does not qualify me as "overweight" (I know BMI isn't the best measure but it'll be nice still)...General: Considering a career change I currently work in sales (which I like) but I work with family right now which can be stressful a change of scenery might be good for my health.
Struggle: I've been dating a guy for about a month and a half. He is a heavy drinker and doesn't like doing sober things with me. And thinks my blackout last week  was no big deal  and  if he had a dollar for every time he doesn't remember doing something dumb while drinking he'd be rich.  I don't think I can stay sober while dating him so I know I need to break up with him. ..Triumph: I got a sponsor at AA. She's absolutely wonderful and so supportive and told me because I'm so willing to get help right now that I need to start working the steps now. So I'm going to start that soon. Also I'm a full week sober. 7 days. ..Also school has been rough. I'm finishing in 9  days!!! So I just gotta get through that and then I'm finally done forever. ..General: in my sobriety I decided to use that extra time and calories to get back in shape. I meal prepped this week and am currently writing this on the gym elliptical. Might as well be productive and sober! ..IWNDWYT 
Struggle: I feel lost in life now. My relationship with my gf isn't doing so well. My relationship with some friends isn't doing so well. My motivation with work is low. My appetite is through the roof and nothing seems to nourish me. I had a dream about throwing up my arms saying  f**k it  and drinking again for the rest of my life. Because  drinking and being a nobody for the rest of my days  would be  easier. ..Triumph: Today is day 14. Two weeks! I'm excited to have made it this far and am excited to keep going. Sleep patterns are returning to normal and I am actually sleeping through the night. Some really good friends are stepping up to support me in my sober journey. Friends that have surprised me and I didn't think would respond the way they have. I am very grateful for these friends. With all the good that is happening and all the structure I am putting up in my life there is no way that drink for the rest of my days would be easier...General: I am an avid bicyclist and runner. This whole confusing appetite thing really sucks! So I have started to keep a food journal for everything I eat and how it makes me feel. In a month I should have my nutrition back in line. I figure this is part of the sobriety process as meals are not including a  liquid diet  anymore and my body has to readjust. 
*Struggle*: really bummed following the house inspection today. Because some anonymous person had rung the real estate a couple of weeks back complaining my yard was full of trash and attracting vermin to neighbour's yards [a complete fiction!] the estate is now very down on me. Even having plants on my front verandah is not really approved of anymore I found out today because they don't want the complainer to have any grounds to complain again. and then she looks out back too and there was no junk to be seen [strange that] so she hums and haws. then I make a comment about us getting stray cats in the yard as one was in the garden. I could tell she didn't believe it was not some extra cat we've decided to have [which would be a breach of our lease we have permission for our one beloved indoor cat whom she had seen when inspecting the kitchen]. on leaving she points to a bag of potting mix near the front fence and says isn't that rubbish? no it's potting mix. Well you better put it in a shed. and get rid of the broken chair down the back. *there is no broken chair* I think. There is one of our garden chairs had fallen over in the wind a few weeks back and I hadn't  bothered to set it upright because like it's just a plastic garden chair that's fallen over way down the back. But the real estate cares if my chairs are all standing up normally I suppose. Most of all the fact some bully has used the estate agent to cause ongoing stress for me [as we will now be on the shit list for good] has disturbed me deeply. The real estate said the complainer did not even give their name "they don't have to" were her exact words. So basically I could ring anyone's real estate and make up some fabricated shit about them to make their lives hell and the real estate would take it seriously and put the screws on that person. How is this RIGHT? I'm rattled. And every time I have gone out back for a smoke [normally I love sitting out back with or without a smoke] I keep looking for a broken chair that is not there... just in case somehow I missed seeing it... even though I KNOW there is no broken chair. This is the residue of fuzzy self-blaming shame-filled alcoholic thinking patterns. Not trusting my own perception and memory and sensory evidence. Damn it made me feel like getting blotto tonight the whole situation. I loved this house. I felt secure here. Now I feel like I am living on eggshells all because of some unknown bully using the real estate to harass me...*victory* didn't drink. even though I had to go to the city booze barn this evening to stock up on my fizzy water and NA drinks for the Easter weekend I did not buy booze. I did not drink booze...*general* I really wish there had not been so many abusers and bullies in my life it just means I have this huge deep scar that new episodes reopen. Time to pull out the healing tools learned in counseling and psychotherapy again. .
Struggle: Work is really stressful. My partner is getting on my nerves leaving huge messes all over our apartment and generally just not investing in us right now. .Triumph: I'm on time for work. .General: I'm in a horrible mood today. Last night I was really tempted to drink. I'm still sober I'm still here.
Struggle: Trying to see if I need my anxiety meds or if I can wean off them..Triumph: week 3 of my new job and I feel like I'm settling in a little bit..General: I love my gf. We're looking for houses now that I've gotten my drinking under control a bit. I'm so much happier these days and it's making me love her even more 
Struggle: working at a new office where they are heavy drinkers. They gave me shit the other day for not going with them to happy hour? ..Triumph: I made a promise to myself not to drink and sticking with it. ..General: my life seems to be falling into the right place. I'm clear headed and that helps me a lot at work. I'm just concern that my coworkers will not like me because I'm constantly rejecting happy hour with them and that includes my boss.  I just don't think I'm ready to go to a bar and just sit there. 
**Triumph:** Just back from a four-day family vacation. Some wonderful moments of joy and fun. At no point despite the Struggles below did a drink seem appealing...**Struggle:** We were all on edge and slight frictions easily burst into flames. I had a work project go south and my stress about that seeping into everything else. I don't know why the kids were such monsters but it was easy to interpret them going from angels to devils wilfully and react accordingly...**General:** I read an article that authoritatively traced "nincompoop" back to Latin to make a political point. Neither online Merriam Webster or Oxford English dictionaries support that. Hmmm...
Struggle: LIFE - - Don't get me wrong i am NOT an "Oh Woe is me" kind of person just some days are hard.  Life has had a lot of harsh lessons for me the past few years and now I am trying to dig out of them and face the new world.  I as the song goes am often my own worst enemy - and procrastination... uggg.Triumph: GETTING up out facing things.  Nothing MAJOR but a lot of it is in the small victories that I get daily!  .General:  Holding it together with no wine to fall back on.  :)  .

Struggle:. In January my mom who I am extremely close with was dxed with a recurrence of cancer. But it went from stage 1 to stage 4. Long term prognosis isn't good. She takes care of my dad who has early dementia. I am devastated shocked and overwhelmed with dread...In February my dh was dxed with cancer. It is intermediate stage but aggressive.  He is having surgery April 9th. My anxiety is through the roof..Triumph:.Even though my drinking has been escalating for a year I used these 2 events as an excuse for a free for all for about a month. Until this past Sunday morning when I found this place.  This is my 4th day and I will not use my anxiety as an excuse to commit a slow suicide...General: .You guys are really nice...
Struggle: Not sure if I should go back to my old job. I quit partially because I felt that I couldn't get sober while still there but things feel different now. Just not sure what to do. I do have friends there that support my sobriety and the job is ideal for me in most other ways... I'm just wasting time doing what I am doing now -- which is practically nothing lol. Its really hard to make a decision and commit plus the whole time I've been off my skills have undoubtedly been slipping.  ..Triumph: Totally reevaluated my approach to sobriety and though only on day 10 today really feel like the changes I've made are helping and well totally different -- one of which is checking in here daily. IWNDWYT!..General: Its going to be kind of nice out today so I'm going to shampoo the carpet in my truck lol. Exciting life eh?
Congrats on the judge's comments u/sfgirlmary; I hope the hearing went well!..**Triumph:** I haven't craved a drink in over a week; I know that doesn't seem like a huge deal since I'm almost 3 months sober but it's a pretty big deal for me...**Struggle:**  I'm on the cusp of completely deleting my Facebook account. I just need a copy of all my data (photos timeline etc) and then I think I'll take the plunge. I was prompted by both the recent Cambridge Analytica issue and the rabbit hole of anxiety and anger I plummeted down after work yesterday just being on there for a couple hours. I can't get that time back and I don't truly know most of those people anymore. It's just something to talk about with my therapist but it's still disappointing. ..**General:** I'm debating downgrading from a smart phone once my current plan is up for renewal. I have no idea how practical it is at this time but that's what this research is for. 
Hot mess is an old term? Who knew? Thanks for that!
Struggle: My mother in law is visiting and she drives me up a damn wall. ..Triumph: Even though I used to drink to deal with my mother in law I have not; however I've eaten a bit more candy than I usually do...General: Glad to be able to come to SD to keep myself on track. 
You are hearby declared awesome and amazing. That is incredible work. 
Struggle: Found out I'm severely anemic (which may account for why I'm still lacking in energy and fuzzy on day 17) Colonoscopy is scheduled (Sorry for the TMI) ..Triumph: I'm on day 17! No feeling like death no hiding no chugging on a pint of Vodka until I pass out and struggle the next morning to remember if I posted stupid shit on social media. HA Other then the tiredness/Fuzzyness I do feel pretty good...General: Pollen is not a substitute for "spring snow"  I am so over the yellow car coating!
Struggle: Here I am at day two and realize I haven't had a sober weekend in 4 years. Feeling ok about it now but knowing myself I'm afraid of the temptation that will ensue..Triumph: 10 hours of sober sleep last night! Still have my job of 10 years (barely) and a loving kind wife who has decided to stop drinking too..General: Going for a mountain bike ride today. For a while I would just go park around the corner with my bike and get loaded so my wife would think I was actually riding. Here's to not lying to the ones we love!
**Struggle:** I still have post-concussive syndrome so I have a constant headache and Im constantly getting dizzy spells. They are often like the spins you get from binge drinking. So while I've been sober I get all the crappy side effects from over drinking without the ability to drink more to numb the pain. ..**Triumph:** My birthday is in a few days and I'm finally starting to get excited about ways to celebrate that don't involve drinking. It will be my first birthday without a drink in... 15 years? ..**General:** I don't think I quite noticed just how incredibly much alcohol pervades our culture. I wonder if the majority of our communities have at least some unhealthy dependencies on alcohol. I'm seeing the world with non-beer goggles. 
Struggle: Recently dealing with a bad bout of insomnia just in time for exams. Didnt sleep till 6am...Triumph: My will is no less resolute. Still want to be better and I know falling behind is just a minor setback - and one that ive accounted for in any case. 
Struggle: I've been thinking about mortality a lot more lately than I'm entirely comfortable with.  Between my aging parents (who are broke) my grandma who just suffered a stroke and just - thinking about how painful loss is.  Spring is always hard for me as it's the anniversary of when a close friend died by suicide.  I find myself torn between being happy about the birds sunshine grass etc. and waiting for the other shoe to drop and everything to be turned inside out like it did that year she died.  It's almost a physical feeling of apprehension. ..Triumph:  But I've stayed sober through it.  Being able to be there for family in the last week has been such a ... blessing?  (I'm not religious but that's the only word that comes to mind.)  In times like these I usually would have been stoned most of the time and spent at least a few days hungover.  Instead of getting up early and being with grandma I would have dragged myself out about 11am resented having to spend time just sitting around and day drank pretty much the moment I was able to leave.  What a jerk.  But I wasn't this time.  ..General:  I'm going to London in a week and I'm nervous!  But excited but nervous.  It's going to rain the whole time I'm there (no surprise) and I'll be by myself overseas for the first time but I need a vacation sooooo bad even if I just sleep in and wander around staring at art for 10 days it will be fantastic. 
Struggle: Finding I have less tolerance for trolls on all forms of social media in general. .Triumph: I am quitting all social media so this will soon not be a problem any longer. As well as I had a very zen moment this week as well as hit my 90 days recently..General: Sobriety at times is challenging but totally worth it! IWNDWYT!
**Struggle:** Stopping drinking has forced me to face how poor my social skills are. I really struggle at reaching out to people and bonding with them. Fixing that will be a lot tougher than putting down the bottle. ..**Triumph:** I've got a nice streak going on Duolingo. Working on my fourth language!..**General:** Really want to see Wes Anderson's new flick just need it to come to a theatre near me now. 
S:  school.  Failing my last semester of nursing school.   Also don't really have the drive to pull myself out.  I'm taking a break right now ..T:  in the desert.   Brought the rain and snow with me.  I feel like Eyeore...G:  found out "bless their heart" is basically a  back handed insult.
Struggle: Having dreams about binge  drinking because I get mad at someone..Triumph: Waking up and thinking what a nightmare that was..General: Happy to be working on 8 days sober. Looking forward to going camping for the first time sober this weekend. .
[removed]
HUMPPPPP DAYYYY!!!! ..Struggle: I'm eating all the sweets. Ice cream container says it comes with 12 servings. I've somehow found a way to make that a 3-serving size container...Triumph: Almost made my 1 month mark. The cravings are certainly diminished. At least the vividness of the cravings have subsided. I still get the random "I should get drunk" thought but it isn't the same as the first 1-2 weeks...General: I have a birthday coming up and a vacation planned with my brother. I haven't told him yet that I've quit drinking but I'm sure it will come up when I see him and decline a beer or whatever. The birthday thing is whatever. My parents asked me last night if I had any plans for it and I just said "Nope not doing anything". It is on a Tuesday after all and I have no friends. *shrug*
what a lovely triumph mary! the general had me giggling...struggle: missing my toxic ex also very angry and bitter about love. i am a "hot mess" when it comes to relationships...triumph: worked hard this week so i could be off for my move. i feel less anxious being off work for 3 days. ..general: the move is saturday! i am excited for it to be over but grateful i am able to be moving as that is a dream for many people. i am also blessed with friends and family that are helping - that is huge. 
Struggle: sleeeeeeeeeep. Will it ever come back? It's not so bad once I'm finally out but onset is an hours long process. Probably isn't helping that I'm on a super early shift for work right now. At least I'm in the middle of a good book to kill the late night hours. ..Triumph: I did something nice for a couple of friends and it seemed to mean a lot to them. I don't know if I would have been clear headed enough to do that when drinking. I definitely wouldn't have been able to afford it. ..General: nothing but rain coming. At least the Temps are up. 
Struggle: ..Still trying to find my groove 9 days after my vacation ended. There doesn't seem to be nearly enough time in the day to get things done. ...Triumph:..I'm giving Keto a try finally. Preparing nearly all my meals instead of going out for lunch every day. So far so good. Also I quit diet soda as of Monday.  Le Croix stock is about to go up just FYI. ...General:.I need to quit internet and social media (again). That's where a lot of my time is disappearing. It can be relaxing to just turn the brain off and peruse r/all but I inevitably get annoyed and/or aggravated by something I see. 
I'm tempted to drink right now it's been 18 days and I've been doing great. I haunt really had any urges. But today my bf and I are arguing because of fucked up things that ive done to him when I was drunk like talking to other people. Last night somebody from my past text me and he found out this morning because he checked online. And we gotinto this argument. Right now we are living with his aunt waiting to move into a house. I'm so excited for this new chapter but my natural self wants to say fuck it. And my ego is saying fuck him. And these demons are just telling me to only drink one. please help. I'm going to shower and try my best to pray on it and avoid. But I wanted to tell somebody my thoughts
Struggle: my colleagues are going for drinks after work and I had to turn down the offer. It upsets me because drinking with them was always so fun for me but I had a dream about alcohol last night and am feeling too fragile to go. ..Triumph: I knew right away that I had to say no to this evening. A bunch of versions of how it would go went swimming through my head. I do feel one step closer to being able to go without drinking just not tonight. I'm getting a mani pedi instead. ..General: saying  no  and doing something else for myself is empowering. 
Struggle: Lately ive been really wanting to get back in to using drugs. Not alcohol but adderall or any amphetamines i can find. Also been really wanting to get back in to oxys.I know i shouldn't be using these again no more or less than i should be using alcohol but there is a part of my brain thats trying to convince me that my real problem was with alcohol and since i didnt abuse opiates or amphetamines the same way i abused alcohol it would be okay for me to use them again. I know this is a lie but i still find myself wondering who i could score speed from...Triumph: I got my sixty day chip yesterday and im so proud.
Struggle: Regaining trust in my relationship. My partner understands my struggle with addiction but has a hard time trusting me due to dishonesty surrounding it in the past. It's hard for her to invest herself in me emotionally right now which I completely understand. It's early on in my efforts towards recovery (this time around) and it will take time and diligence on my part to regain that trust. At least she believes in me and supports my efforts. I just don't want to let her down and start off again from -100..Triumph: Successfully avoided drinking during a few major 'trigger times' by treating my urges as ignorable out of band 'noise'. Had many urges to go to the corner store to get 'just one 22oz IPA' or have 'just a glass' of the bottle of wine in the kitchen but I didn't act upon them and took care of other productive urges like fixing some things around the house. Learning to prioritize/categorize urges is huge for me..General: Really enjoying taking solid poops again! Sorry but this is a big deal for me ;)
Struggle: Have the occasional FOMO sadness when certain people want to have a drink with me. Then I remember how bad it is for me thankfully. Still a little sad but I get over it quickly...Triumph: Two weeks on holiday in France with heavy drinkers and was able to say no to alcohol several times a day and it wasn't an issue...General: Feeling generally awesome waking up with no hangover and getting things done. I have an influx of emotions coming and going lately that were likely dulled before which is a little unnerving at times but I manage it with meditation. Just regular feels I suppose but a little all over the place.

Verily I am also a hot mess but only because I'm so stressed out I can hardly see straight. Work is going to kill me dead. 
**Struggle:** Got a period for the first time in 8 months when I though maybe just maybe I was close to entering menopause and never having to bleed/cramp/bitchfest again. It's as if the period knew my feelings towards it and has arrived and made its presence known accordingly with crime scene worthy carnage collateral damage and intense cramps/pain...**Triumph:** I have hit 90 days without drinking. Never in my adult life have I gone this long without having a drink. I can't believe it. ..**General:** I have the most supportive wife on the planet. I am so grateful for her; she also brought me home my favorite chocolate cupcakes and salted chocolate caramels from my favorite local dessert shop as a gift for my 90 day achievement. &lt;3 
Struggle: Hadn't slept that great for a couple nights..Triumph: I think this long period of abstinence is paying off. A long term physical symptom of anxiety is magically disappearing  (2 years of constant chest pain) also work is going better
I actually slept last night!  I went to be and read for a few hours later than normal but I was able to ACTUALLY sleep for 6 hours.  I woke up feeling super groggy though that probably has something to do with not sleeping much the last 2 days.
I just commented on another post and realized today is my 1500 day without a damn drink!! HOLLA ! 
**Struggle:** Daughter was bullied at school today...**Triumph:** Back into regular cycling following a winter where I got out once a week at best...**General:** I don't know why but someone has been adding soil to our garden...The plot thickens...
I'm proud of you too!  I've told your basic story to a few folks in the vein of the kind of hold alcohol can have on one and how one can reverse one's life.  You're so amazing!..**Struggle:**  My father.  Ugh. I wanna wring his scrawny neck.  And take care of him. And never see him again.  I know I can't make him stop drinking but I can't just abandon him to his ways either.  I'm really hoping his extended stay in the hospital breaks down some of his walls of denial..**Triumph:**  I am taking care of myself through this tough time for the most part.  Exercise eating well and letting myself cry.  Started sobbing in the middle of spin class but it was cathartic (hopefully everyone else was in their pain cave and didn't notice!)..**General:**  I miss speaking Spanish. Need a way to practice that doesn't take up a ton of my time.  Ordering tacos at the taco truck ain't doing it! 
Struggle: only finishing up day 3 and the loneliness is already hitting me very hard. And boredom. It's insane because I am a very lonely/secret drinker why would I crave making that worse? Haven't had or thought I COULD have a girlfriend for almost a decade oy.  ..Triumph: getting delicious food at the moment and bought a gym membership. Hope to use it this time.
Struggle: I am on my first week and have plans to go out on Saturday.  These friends are cool and will understand.  I haven't seen one of them in years which is the main reason I want to go.  I know they will be drinking.  They wont pressure me but I will be at a bar for sure...Triumph:  On day 4!  I finally got some sleep last night after 2 sleepless nights...General:  I have a DnD group to play with this weekend and I am excited for it!
