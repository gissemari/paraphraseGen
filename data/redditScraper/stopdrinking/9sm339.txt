I'm 28 I'm young. I watched my dad deal with the same Demons I'm dealing with with alcohol. It sucks. Here I am doing the same thing. I come from a privileged upbringing where struggling with alcohol isn't talked about so I tell no one...I am in counseling. ..I want to live. I'm so scared. A lot of times I think the only thing that will fix me is suicide. Why do I do?

Hey buddy that suicide thing that s the demon talking. He s not part of you. He s not you. He s not something you need to be affiliated with...This sub is full of people who have felt what you feel now me included. I battled that demon for 15 years and saw no end - until it came and that end wasn t death it was life in a way I simply couldn t imagine surrounded by the darkness of my night. What I experienced when the sun rose and I stopped drinking and faced my demons was that the kicking and screaming wasn t him defeating me it was his frantic death cramps...You re here you re doing real work you can do this. I will not drink with you today.
Sounds like you're having a pretty harsh time mate but keep at it. Have you done much reading to try and reconfigure your thinking? I've just finished The Unexpected Joy Of Being Sober and it was great... really encouraging and there's a section in there when she waa wrestling with the same dilemma you are. I haven't got that bad so I can't say it's outside of my experience but stick with it. You got some sober buddies a crew like that could offer good support right now!
