Un-fucking-real... ..To think that I spent the last decade blowing off school work and personal decisions in exchange for the bottle and enhancing that with prescription drugs. I am so thankful to not be mixing shit like Effexor and Seroquil with shots of Old Crow whiskey. I am so much more clear headed and motivated and I have a great AA homegroup I go to at 6:30 AM 3-5 times a week...Back in late August I was roaming the streets of downtown Portland OR hiding off the grid for 40 days trying to drink myself to death and slowly try to pull the plug on myself. After 30 days had gone by people thought I had jumped off a bridge due to an unfinished suicide note I had written while drunk and had no recollection of writing. Now I have a steady job as my own boss with a few clients and things are really looking up!..I want to thank the folks here at SD for playing part in my sobriety when I couldn't make to AA meetings. This has been a great tool to connect with people from around the globe who struggle with alcohol and share their stories...Cheers and DON'T DRINK!
