I was taking the tram home from work yesterday and there was this lady sitting close to me. I had my headphones on so didn't really notice her but as she got up to leave her paper bag carrying a few groceries collapsed. I helped her gather her stuff while another person gave me a plastic bag to hold them. She was holding a Coke bottle and smelled of booze. She was very zoned out of it and it was only 3pm. Another person held the tram door open to help her get out in time...I haven't stopped thinking about this woman since she was a young respectable looking woman but clearly was struggling. I said a prayer for her last night and hope that someday she gets the help she needs. I had thought about having a drink after work yesterday but that encounter jolted me back to the reality of what my drinking was like...Please please please keep trying if you are struggling to stay sober. Alcohol just isn't worth it...I will not drink with you today. Xx

That lady is included in my thoughts today along with us all..  IWNDWYT  
Encounters like this just bring it all home to you!  Stay strong people and I will not drink with you today :)
I am very very sure that I have been that lady in the past. Make up done decently dressed but smelling of alcohol and trying to hide the clinking of bottles in my bag. You did a really good thing yesterday. Thinking of her but glad I'm not her anymore  IWNDWYT
