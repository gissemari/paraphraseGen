Cuddled my son to sleep for his morning nap. Trying to let that love and peace suffuse through me and radiate out to others.  I need to be the quiet glow...Tried something new today. Took all my frustrations and reframed them as things I am thankful for. Instead of focusing on my father in law banging a found at 5am being quiet I am grateful for the place to stay with family...Then there are the things I am truely grateful for. The love and support of my family. A growing centeredness and self-awareness. This place to vent and struggle and share support. Another day sober
