I had an intensely vivid dream that I relapsed. It was if it was so real. I felt the drunkenness shame guilt etc...I'm pleased to say that although I was a bit disturbed I am still sober. ..IWNDWYT

I had one the other night. I also had one where I was with Olivia Munn. Can confirm both never happened
