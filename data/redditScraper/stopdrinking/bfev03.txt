Your bottom isn't my bottom.....It breaks my heart. Even though you're no good for me. Even though I've been told many times to let you go that I deserve better there's still that little bit of hope..So now I have to be strong pretend to be unphased. .You saw my calls &amp; texts yesterday. It was a bad day..I'm angry &amp; hurt by you yet I understand you so damn well..All the times you were passed out a bottle not too far away even if it was hidden. The messages to other girls that were deleted. The names &amp; things I was accused of because you felt guilt from the things you did. .There were times you were thoughtful about the little things that made me happy. .And times you acknowledged your behavior &amp; tried to fix it. But that bottle has a strong grip once it takes hold. And it feels good to not feel. To not deal. Until it becomes too heavy..I got to see you see you for everything. Who you were are and can be..And I have to remind myself that as an alcoholic going deeper into the bottle that you're the only one who can pull yourself from the chaos. .As much as you want control you have none..I hope one day you find your bottom because I understand very much the pain you project is internalized as well. And no matter the pain you caused you deserve to heal. .And I can tell you climbing up from the bottom is gonna hurt like a bitch but it'll start to feel better. .Even though I've been told to let you go....I have faith you'll find your way even from a distance. Until then...IWNDWYT ...**This could go on a few boards but wanted to share it here for those struggling with guilt about actions they have done. If you're trying I know it's hard but I see you. Do not kick yourself in the ass for your past. Your actions today &amp; choosing to not drink &amp; be better than what you were are payment to yourself &amp; those caught in the crossfire**
