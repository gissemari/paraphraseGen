My best friend got a DUI last month. She blew a .33 at 1:30 in the afternoon and was taken to the ER because her BAC was so high. I feel awful for her husband who is suffering because of her actions and had to pay thousands to bail her out of jail and pay her lawyer. I've no idea what punishment she will get and I continue to watch her spiral out of control. I myself have been struggling with quitting alcohol and have driven many times in the past when I shouldn't have which is something I am ashamed of. I used to be disgusted with people who drink and drive and never thought I would become one of them until I started to struggle with alcoholism. I want to learn from my friends mistake and never drink and drive again ever. .

My DUI stopped my destructive downward spiral. But you're right it doesn't *have* to be yours to give you a reason to change. It is possible. 
I had to lose more than I was willing to lose before I quit drinking. I was stopped four times by the police when I know I had to be .20 and never got a ticker. Twice I was in accidents and didn't get a ticket. One accident even failed a sobriety test and the cop told my wife to drive me home (accident was clearly the other person's fault). Did any of these cause me to quit drinking?  Hell no.  I didn't lose anything. ..Luckily I did quit before I lost eveything. AA taught me that I didn't have to lose everything or kill someone. I could choose my own bottom. That made sense to me. I got a desire chip that night and I haven't drank since. ..Please find a recovery program and kick this awful disease. If you are an alcoholic it is not your fault but it is your problem.
