No deep thoughts no powerful insights no drama--just a quiet night with the weekend beckoning...It's good for me to stop and appreciate a little peace of mind. It's oddly good too to contrast how much effort I wasted chasing contentment at the bottom of glass after glass where it never was with how much less effort it takes me to let things flow naturally...I may yet struggle I may yet have bad days to come but tonight is good. Tonight I didn't drink with you and I'm content with that. Peace SD.
