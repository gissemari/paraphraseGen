Hi all I relapsed for 6 months but I thought it was longer so that's the good news.  I don't have much bad news I'm just glad to be back.  I got some great support last year but I won't torture myself about who I may have let down it's counterproductive. ..It's Friday so I'm watching Netflix and getting a pizza.    ..I hope you're all having a great Friday  ..Dean

I'm glad you're back. And good not torturing yourself I never found self-flagellation to be a good means of keeping sober either...Netflix and pizza sounds like a pleasant Friday. I'm going to my dad's for dinner with the family...It'll be a great Friday for sure! Just gotta stay on the sober path.
Cool. .
Welcome Dean. Netflix? Pizza? Sounds like a solid plan to me. ..I will not drink with y'all today.    within
