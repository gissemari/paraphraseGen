Alright. So after eight years of being a horrendous drunk I've made it 70 days without any booze or drugs. Gave up cigarettes and energy drinks 63 days ago but I do still get by with a vape. ..I had a rough week around my dad's birthday awhile back but I got through it. I've been fretting very hard over what I'm going to do for a future for stable steady reliable income. One step at a time...I've tried to quit drinking and smoking before countless times. One thing I never did was just quit everything. Generally when I'd quit booze before I'd turn to pot and occasional drug use. I made it 90+ days December  17-March  18 before relapsing around the time my mom died in hospice. Shortly after a close friend was murdered. I was also going through a breakup from a three year relationship that took over six months. After all that it became a struggle to stay on board for the rest of the year. Constant off and on. I went through many bouts of sheer insanity with drinking and everything that was going on. ..October of 2018 a woman who'd known me for awhile told me I didn't need rehab but  You need a good woman a hot meal less nicotine and a good night's sleep. ..It's beginning to seem as if she was right. This time around with quitting it seems as if something much larger than me has been involved. It was almost effortless to put everything down and walk away. It's all strange but great...Thank you for reading. .IWNDWYT

&gt; You need a good woman a hot meal less nicotine and a good night's sleep...Don't we all ;-).  Also that's great.  2 months is an awesome accomplishment.  Keep it up and IWNDWYT!
70 days is an accomplishment. I am at 78 days so I know how hard it is..I would prefer a 'loose' woman to a 'good' one at this point.
