I'm struggling hard today. I was struggling hard last night. But I'm still here still fighting myself. I have to go to the grocery store today and walk past the liquor section shortly after entering but I did that last week. Only difference now is seven days. I stand hard in the fact that I need to know myself without that liquor to deaden my nights. Weekends are tough.

I'm 7 days today too. I feel so much happier though.  I hope you are finding some positives out of your brilliant 7 days sober. We need to be so proud of ourselves. 
Nice work. Stay strong. IWNDWYT. Hugs  
Bravo!
