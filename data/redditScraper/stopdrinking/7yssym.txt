This is the longest I've gone in months without having my one night a week of boozing and doing stupid shit. I find it to be very true that once you surrender yourself to the fact that you no longer have the ability to stop drinking once you start you're on your way to a healthier and happier life. The first drink is never worth it. I hope this helps someone tonight struggling. Sobriety is worth it. You are worth it. I am worth it. Goodnight loves. Stay strong.
