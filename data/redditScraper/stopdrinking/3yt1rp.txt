I'm so grateful to have made it through the Christmas period without a drink. Today has been a rough one. Had to get up at 5.15 to catch our flight home. It's getting harder and harder to leave my mum alone. She's 77 and really not doing so well. I live in another country - which I love - and I am an only child so the guilt is hard. We aren't very close but I feel terrible leaving her to struggle alone...But at the same time I am so so happy to be home. Had a sleep this afternoon. We will all eat pizza tonight watch crap on TV and enjoy being able to fart swear and speak German!! Bittersweet. I know how happy the children are to not have to be on best behaviour anymore...Arriving somewhere after a trip was always a time to drink so I am feeling a bit raw all round this evening. I am not going to drink and i can get a good night's sleep and feel much better tomorrow morning.

Hello and bravo for 14 days sober! I am not going to drink today either!
Congrats on two weeks!
Congratulations on your 2 weeks - getting some space to rest and relax is always nice.
