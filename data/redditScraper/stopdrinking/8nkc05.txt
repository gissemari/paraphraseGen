I'm a little freaked out about posting my face on the internet but I hope I can help someone else out who is struggling today..[Before and After - 50 Days Sober](https://imgur.com/a/ihw4f7R)..I took the before picture on my way to my first AA meeting. Believe it or not I *am* wearing makeup in the before picture! (Foundation powder mascara) My skin was just so blotchy puffy and bloated from swigging vodka while drinking two bottles of wine a day haha!..Getting sober is the best gift I have ever given myself. After multiple arrests crashing my vehicle and fucking up all my relationships I didn't think there was hope for me: I was ashamed of myself. I don't feel that way any more. Even at 50 days in I feel so damn hopeful about the future even if it's a little scary. ..If you're struggling reach out for help and you will receive it. I personally have chosen AA and I go every day. I've met an amazing community of people who I now call friends and feel more loved than I ever had...IWNDWYT

Inspiring. Thank you 
That isn't fair. I'm 86 daus in and still look like a spoiled tomato. 
Thanks for sharing! Inspiring for sure! IWNDWYT 
Look at you!  Simply stunning transformation!  You are radiant!  Congratulations!  Not sure at 48 if I'll get the same type of results but you pic inspires me to get to day 50 to find out! 
Awesome! What a major accomplishment! Yes sobriety is a gift! IWNDWYT 
you look incredible! congratulations on your milestone that's a pretty awesome achievement. also thank you for letting me know that i am not alone on wanting to eat everything in the house especially if it's sweet :)...thank you for this post. IWNDWYT!
Wow!  Amazing transformation in every way!  
Keep it up gorgeous ;).
WOW! What an amazing transformation. 
Congrats on 50 days!!!! You look amazing!!! 
Holy macaroni!  After just 50 days?  Amazing!  Keep it up (:
You look great- the change is very noticeable! I can see it in your eyes as well...I can so relate to drinking and binge eating. Many times after a night of drinking I would wake up to food scattered all over my kitchen counters and floor like a raccoon had gotten into the fridge and had its way with my food supply. 99% of the time I wouldn't even remember eating any of it. Then I would spend 2-3 hrs at the gym trying to work off food I couldn't even remember eating. Not my finest moments.. I'm cringing even typing that out.
Looking great! Keep it up girl! 
Way to be brave! Maybe one day I'll share a photo too. Congratulations to you. Amazing accomplishment.
Congratulations you look amazing and more importantly you look peaceful and happy.  Hugs to you!
Awesome work! I'm so happy your world is improving. (And thanks for the reminder that AA is for everyone -- atheists and agnostics included. Love seeing other Group of Drunks believers around these parts!)
holy crap what a difference!!  You look awesome sobriety is treating you well!  IWNDWYT
Hey girl you look GORGEOUS! I was thinking maybe I'll post a before/after at 30 60 etc. Good idea :\) Congrats to you! ..IWNDWYT
Please post after a year you look 5 years younger on today's picture! Inspiring!
You look amazing!..I relate to your story so much. Multiple bottles of wine (boxed tbh) mixed with straight alcohol throughout the day. ..Drinking in my car...Giving up on the gym because I decided I preferred day drinking. ..Ice cream. So much this...I agree so much about the help part. Quitting is some much easier when you seek help from others...Congratulations on getting back on track.  Getting sober (and getting healthy again) feels so much better than I ever thought it would..
You look so healthy!  And pretty!  Congrats on 50 days P&amp;R references are always nice too :)
Wow I just realized my skin looks so good because I quit drinking haha that never even occurred to me! My 'God' is The Force like Star Wars :) You look stunning! I also had multiple arrests and had to crash my car into a light post to learn my lesson... IWNDWYT
What a miracle. So inspiring! Congratulations and keep it up! Cheers
You look great! This was helpful for me today thank you!
That's an amazing transformation!! at first I thought you were at day 500 not 50 and I still thought it was amazing for that time but even more so when I re-read it. Keep up the good work! 
Sobriety agrees with you. ..Also love the P&amp;R reference. Treat yo self!
You look great!
You look wonderful!! I really need this post today-- you helped me. I'm pushing to almost 50 days. I'm in my hometown for the summer which has been a challenge because it's my old binge drinking stomping grounds. THANK YOU for this post :) 
Your eyes. .So tired and defeated.Now alive and determined. ..So proud of you!..IWNDWYT 
You look like a different person and I bet you feel like one too!  Awesome job!..It took my body a while to catch up and start shedding a little weight after I stopped drinking.  I was also eating ice cream and candy too much but it was better than booze.  And now that I've really weaned from booze my sweets habit has also leveled out.  It takes time but we can ALL get there!
Hello!! 50 days is amazing! ..You look great!..Let's keep going together!..ONWARD TO 100 !!
Wow. You look fantastic!! What a transformation in such a short space of time :-).Fair play to you for embarking on this journey we are all on to live healthier more fulfilling lives. You're an inspiration! Keep up the good work...IWNDWYT 
That is awesome. IWNDWYTD.
You look amazing  great job lady! I'll post progress at day 50 too  you inspired me to do it. IWNDWYT!
This is inspiring! I'm going to do the same to inspire myself. 
I'm at Day 44 and I feel you on eating sugar like there's no tomorrow (and having a similar wine habit for several years!). I've never eaten so much ice cream in my life (and I used to work at a Ben &amp; Jerry's in high school!)! Gives me hope! I for sure feel better than I did over a month ago - and your progress on eating better and exercise gives me hope to not just continue my sobriety but to start working out (like I used to love to do!). Thanks for the inspiration and IWNDWYTD!!
Girl you look amazing! Keep on winnin'  
You look amazing!!    IWNDWYT 
You look amazing Op and congrats on being sober. I will not drink with you today. 
Go girl!!! You look great and way to go congrats on 50 days! 
Amazing!
Great job getting to 50 days! Jealous of your awesome skin improvement mine seems to have worsened!
You look like a different person! Amazing transformation. Thank you for sharing. It helped me today. ..IWNDWYT

EAT ALL THE SUGAR!! I gave my self about a year of sweets and every now and then I still eat them :) Iwndwyt
This post will help so many. Thank you. Amazing transformation. 
Amazing work
You look great congratulations!  
Looking great! Keep it up!
I'm just past 50 days myself and the change in how I look and feel is so amazing - so glad to hear others having the same experience! I always used to set goals for myself to go to the gym or diet but drinking and hangovers always won out over  motivation . So happy to finally be achieving them! Keep coming back!
Huge congrats on your sobriety and progress. Also thank you for being willing to be candid and share your experience. That willingness has the potential to help someone else who is currently struggling and debating about whether or not to do something about the situation...Keep taking progress pictures. It can be fun to look back over time and see the change...Here's my six-year progression:. https://twitter.com/silverladder/status/935952023048019968?s=09
You look amazing    well done you. Will not drink with you today. 
You look so good! Keep it up :) 
You look amazing honey! Love this post you could literally be talking about me with your drinking days and AA experiences! Keep up the good work you are glowing :-)
You went from "overtired and overworked mother of 4" to "19 year old college student/model" Way to go OP!
Man I too got  crazy sweet tooth after I stopped drinking while till managing to lose 15 lbs. Keep up the great work you're an inspiration
Wow this is absolutely amazing! You are amazing! \&lt;3 you go girl! I myself am looking to get on the right path of health and fitness as well! What you have wrote is a great inspiration to me. Thank you. IWNDWYT. 
Damn you look awesome! 
Wow! You look incredible! If you take a look at my history I posted a similar post. I was very unsure of posting my face but now I am so glad I did. The support I received was a huge motivation to keep going...I hope you are feeling the same and keep on keeping on!
You look fantastic! Such a wonderful change! 
Wow
What a difference! Congrats :) 
Well done on your 50 days! 
You look very happy Congrats on your milestone. 
Wow way to go 
Looking good! IWNDWYT!
 Wow!  What a difference. I think that is why my face appears so red. This really helps encourage me to continue to not drinking. 
THanks so much for this.  Day 5 here and struggling. :(
Beautiful   ..I feel the same about AA and am continuing to be fearless and thorough. I've got a great sponsor which has made all the difference...And you know what? Treatin yo self is much better than the self-loathing and putting that cunning poison into our bodies! What insanity!..I will sober on doing 90/90 with you    
Good on you mate. You look fantastic...I'm at day 6 certainly don't look as great as you but feeling better.  .IWNDWYT.
Thank you for this. I have also battled legal troubles fucked up my car and broken relationships. I was hospitalized with alcohol poisoning just 1 week ago. I am also an atheist so I have always struggled to get on board with AA. My boyfriend of 3.5 years has broken up with me twice over my issues but is still giving me a 3rd shot. He has faith in me but I've always struggled to have faith in myself. I have never even gotten to 30 days. I am now trying again going into day 8 of sober life. You have inspired me. ..It's funny.. I've already noticed a similar improvement in my own skin as well. No more dark circles! 
Beautiful :) Keep going!. . .
Watermark your photos! Great job too.
Congrats!
You look amazing congrats!!
Awesome testimony. Keep coming back!..Chris k
You are so pretty you look great sober. Congratulations on 50 days.  Find a good (female) sponsor and talk to her.  In the beginning i also did lots of meetings. It helps. There will be rough times ahead and don't try to deal with them alone. Talk to people when it gets hard. Dont keep things to yourself. Go for coffee after meetings with the others. They are fun and informative.  What helped me so much was seeing a counselor as well. I can't say enough good things about it. But make sure if you do that you have a GOOD counselor.  And dont worry about being an athiest.  My sponsor would say when it came to step 3 slip another o in there and turn your life over to the care of "good".  As long as you understand that anyone who has a knowledge you lack is a higher power.  When we learn to trust others who know more than us we expand ourselves and what we can do.  I can't operate on myself so i consult a higher power a surgeon. This person has a knowledge i dont have and can do things i cant. But if i turn it over it almost always goes well.  Its just an example but you get the idea.  I had to learn that i am not the centre of the universe.  My wife is.  It sounds like you are doing well i hope you keep learning and growing.
i just need to get through the cravings and i think i should be fine. great job!
Sure you will look different after being sober but these photos are with and without makeup and good lightning....
Wow you look incredible! And it definitely is treat yo'self 2018 as you are treating yourself by caring for yourself in the best way ever - being sober! ..I really needed to hear that comment about AA to be honest as I have been toying with the idea of going however was put off by the religious aspect. Would you recommend it to someone non religious like myself? Xxx
You look beautiful. Rock on sister! IWNDWYT 
I don't think I've seen a more drastic before and after pic especially after only 50 days. What an incredible transformation. I think getting physically active was key for my sobriety. I sometimes go on a few day sugar binges which I have to work on but life is good. Keep it up hanna
Wow!..Huge difference...Congrats on 51 days!
You look great!  I too lost my fitness when alcohol took over.  I gained 40-50 pounds in my drinking but now I am down 30 pounds today on my 145th day sober and life has never been better.  I'm cycling running hiking rowing anything I want again!  ..Keep up the good work!.
OMG you look absolutely gorgeous!   Congratulations and keep up the good work! You rock Girl! :)
Very well done!  
&gt; I don't really believe in god (atheist) but I do believe in MY god which I found in AA: **G**roup **O**f **D**runks...I love this!
I've stayed away from alcohol for over two years and I'm only getting more fat. Sigh... Great job!
Inspiring thanks for posting and congrats! You got this.
Dang. That's amazing. A lot of the time I don't see much transformation. You can really see the difference here. 
You're beautiful thanks for posting your pics. You're very inspiring. Congratulations on your sobriety.
I want to cry and hug you. 
Thank you so so much for your reply. I am very apprehensive to go to a meeting but you have literally just convinced me it's for the best. You have a fantastic outlook and it really speaks to me. Thanks again for replying &lt;3 IWNDWYT
Thank you for sharing!
I can relate to every part of your post! Thank you for sharing.  
Day 50 looks good on you. You are gorgeous! ..I fell into the same routine. I loved working out and trying new fitness but drinking slowly took over which made the binge eating easy to make excuses for. It is somewhat comforting to hear a similar story. ..I am also atheist so I am a little nervous about AA but I LOVE your meaning you made for your higher power. Thank you so much for sharing. ..IWNDWWT
Congrats what is your skin care regimen and what products do you use ? Everything is working
Treat yo self 2018 lol im 104 days in. Can feel a huge difference.
