This past four days have been the worst of my life. Missed work to drink since tuesday i haven't stop. I got an awful tattoo in my finger. A tattoo that one things i always told myself not to do drunk. Spent all my money in cocaine and alcohol i have only 100 bucks for the whole month. .Binge drinking. Never do that. Its not worth it just watch a movie or read a book..This just needs to stop. Life is really beautiful and im missing it.

What do you want to do next?
I'm sorry addiction is causing such harm. What is your plan?

I can relate to spending irresponsible amounts on alcohol many times over the last year that would be any time I was buying alcohol considering my financial state lately.  I'm amazed at how much I save even though many weeks I wasn't spending "that much".  My goes at sobriety the last couple of months have shown me how exciting it is to see the savings stack up!..I believe you can get a hold on this and move forward how can we help?
