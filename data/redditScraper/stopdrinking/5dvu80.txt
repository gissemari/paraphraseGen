Hey guys just a quick one just wondering how everyone is fairing? ..I've been struggling along this whole time I really thought it would have gotten easier by now or even a semi non issue but it hasn't. I find it just as hard  now as when I started. Does anyone have any tips tricks or comments for me any and all welcome thanks heaps guys :)..

Wow! Kudos! I would never have made it 125 days without the help of my therapist and AA. Going to meetings makes staying sober easier and more fun for me.

Life gets slower ... the peeks aren't there unless you really work at something to accomplish a goal now.  You can peek on alcohol in 10 minutes ... it's the easy way out.  Never fails though ... wake up feeling like Shit ... less money .. legal risk of how you got home etc...I will not drink today with you 
Thanks guys for the help it might have been a simple already answered question but I figured with each day perhaps a new take on how to do sober!
