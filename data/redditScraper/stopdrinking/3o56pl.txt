Okay I've read a bunch of posts here regarding dreams and they range from great vivid and resting dreams to dark relapsing dreams. ..I've always manged to have detailed and very pronounced dreams even while drinking but they were sometimes a blur and not frequent.  Last night when I finally went to bed due to exhaustion (only slept a few hours) I had some very vivid dreams. I didn't think anything of it.  This afternoon I couldn't keep my eyes open so I decided to skip class and sleep.  ..I've had the most vivid dreams I've ever had.  I can still feel the textures the smells the feeling - a person I think I love in my dream from this nap.  Ya'll might get a kick out of this since my buddy can't stop laughing. .. I went to India on this trip thing I won or something stayed at a house I don't know and met this girl... I don't know the person I'm staying with but apparently my parents know him so thats all good.  .*.Let me preface (for Reddit) I last went to India 21 years ago and have minimal memories of the place.*  ..But seriously yo i'm in love with this chick I forgot her name even asked a buddy who knows her to text her but with the wrong name...The plan was for her to reply "who is this"? .....and for him to go "isn't this naavi?" .In hopes she replies back saying her real name but she never did - my in dream plan to find out the girl I love failed ..So back to the story I met her at this house I'm staying at and we just kind of hit it off.  She knew I was going to head back to Canada so we just decided to hang out.  Just went on a regular date like little children (ice cream movies and park).  I remember walking in sandals and feeling the rocks getting between my toes and her remarking that shoes are actually a thing here and I'm trying to hard for the authentic experience. ..She has to go to work but tells me a few stories about her work but she has to buy a couch and her boss won't give her any more time off.  She takes my number and tells me she'll call me at her break and see if we can meet up for a quick lunch.  She bids me bye and tells me what bus to get on.  ..I remember getting on this bus and sitting in an empty seat but feeling uneasy since I don't know anything about where I'm going what so ever but I trust she knew what she was talking about.  I sit down and then eventually these 3 girls come and sit at the row of seats beside me.  I notice one girl is using Bing maps and I turn to them and basically said "can I ask you guys something" in Hindi.  The one with the phone gets all defensive and agigatd and starts asking me "who am I who do I think I am?" extremely hostil while her friend squirms.  This nice old lady beside me (other side) peeks over and tells them to be respectful and kind and tells me to ask what I was going to ask.  I go on "as I was saying do you find Bing maps works well here or Google? I'm from Canada and I mainly use Google there" they tell me Bing (hahaha) and I say thank you and proceed to look straight forward. ..Some minor gap but I remember getting a call from the girl before and looking at the number with the area code (80) 2 something something.  ..Again never been to India since the advent of cells have family there that I haven't talked to in 15+ never call that country.  I just woke up and decided o check the area code and it was +91 80 for Bangalore.  I've never been to that city and for the life of me I can't tell you any other area codes.  Now the caller ID I had on my phone didn't have +91 so that means I had a Indian cell number. Thats such a trip. ..Another blank but I guess this is her lunch time and yea.....We end up going to this mini carnival and went on those tea cup type of rides. Ghetto painted green with chips falling off but get this they give you a sweet (ladoo) for the price of admission.  So here I am eating a ladoo and getting tossed around in a ride.  Her looking at me weird and offering me the other ladoo. ..She tells me shes got work on Saturday from 3-11 but wants to see me before I head back.  I offer to check out sofas for her and give her recommendations while shes at work and hopefully she won't have to spend much time looking on her day off.  She thanks me and that was that.  ..Now is when I get back to "home" and tell my buddy to give her a call because for the life of me I forgot her name.  Starts with a M but thats all I can recall.  ..The Jays scored and there was a loud scream and I abruptly woke up.  Sorry about the abrupt ending but it was nice waking up with a smile. ..To add I AM single but I've been on more than a few dates recently with lovely women but never felt an attraction.  I'm Canadian and while it would be culturally idea to be with an Indian women that really isn't my goal so I have no clue why my mind went there.  ..Just thought I'd share my friends couldn't stop laughing so figure ya'll might get a kick.  ..TL;DR: Had a dream where I went to India and fell in love despite the fact of me not being there for 2 decades and managed to get an area code correct though I don't think I've ever called the country.

What a fascinating dream! I don't know much about sleep but I do know that I get way better sleeps when I am sober. I am sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong but I think that drunken sleeps disrupt REM sleep which we need to get a really deep sleep. Does anyone know if dreams come in REM sleep? Where is that in a different phase? It doesn't really matter. Enjoy your sleep and dreams! Especially the weird dreams.
