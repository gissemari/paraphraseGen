Today is day 50 of my sobriety. I got here with the support of close friends and family from learning to be honest about my struggle attending weekly addiction group sessions new medication that helps with the cravings seeing my psychotherapist regularly and being committed to a continuous recovery process. These are all things I never tried before. And I am still recovering. And it is still hard. But I learned that there are resources and that I do need help. So I will continue to take it one day at a time. Literally. My goal: Abstain today. That's it. TODAY. IWNDWYT
