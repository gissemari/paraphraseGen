So recently I made the decision to stop drinking entirely which has been a blessing in so many ways.  When I made the decision my life was complicated but then everything hit me at once.  Here are just a few things that have happened to me in the last 12 days...First off the girlfriend that I cheated on because of the alcohol started talking to me again which is awesome.  But I feel like she can't ever trust me again eventhough I'll never hurt her again.  Basically I may have lost the best thing that has ever happened to me.  So that is a daily struggle...Next my aunt was diagnosed with ovarian cancer about 3 months ago and has been getting progressively worse over the last 2 weeks.  She had a fall and her body is not reacting to the chemo well.  She is one of the best people I know so seeing her suffer kills me inside...Then my dad was sent to the ER because he overdosed on pain meds then polished off a bottle of barcardi.  He's currently unconscious unresponsive and his kidneys are failing all while being on a ventilator...Lastly my one and only brother who just so happens to be a recovering alcoholic is in a very very bad place.  He's back to drinking using and lying.  These are his cycles and patterns and I see through his bullshit immediately.  He might be able to lie to everyone else but not me...As you can see when it rains it pours and everything happens at once.  The point of all this wasn't to get sympathy or pity.  The point of this was to show each and everyone of you that throughout all of this shit going on I have remained sober and it's too the point now where I'm almost expecting more bad shit to happen just so I can be like "fuck you universe I am staying fucking sober!"  So yeah I'm with you every step of the way and I will remain sober.  There isn't anything that will make me drink again.  I will not drink today and I will not drink again.

My list:              .Missed promotions assholes at work.      .Death of father         .Long illness and death of mother      .Divorce - 4yrs sober.      .Dating!!!           .Promotions new enhanced assholes at work.         .Marriage       .Moving. Buying a house.      .Sept 11.  (Was close by).          .Retirement..Loss of a dream. (selling sailboat before ready to swallow the anchor).       .Daughters wedding...     .And more **all of these would have been made worse if I'd drunk( and for all except 9/11 there was no urge)** on 9/11 I kept walking and it passed in 30 seconds but I still remember it...**you can do it** and do it better sober..
My list:..Loss of professional license and very public disgrace;..IRS Criminal Investigation;..Wife having affair with her sociopathic law partner;..Pleaded guilty to felony charge of attempted Income Tax evasion;..Sentenced to Prison;..Daughter pregnant;..Daughter goes through rehab for alcoholism and substance abuse;..Car destroyed by drunk driver;..Son struggling with his sexuality;..Goes to prison;..Witnesses sexual assault in prison and is put in solidarity confinement for "my safety;" ..Did not drink.  Recovered.  Life works out.  ..Today I am happy frequently joyous and free.  ..Oh and let me say something about the SO issue.  Life and relationships are complicated I love my wife.  We live in separate parts of our house but we are domestic partners in 90% of our lives and to be honest at this point in my life her past struggles with some her feelings for someone else has very little to do with my feelings and respect for her.  It is something she went through and something we went through together.  She doesn't need my forgiveness. ..Edit:  My 4 year old Grandson is the light of my life!..Life gets better with sobriety and time.  
Thanks for posting this.  So many things happen that are out of our control and we still have the ability to control our behavior.  It is marvelous.  Take care.
You're dealing with a boatload! Stay strong... and way to be awesome!
I got a list too of accidents and deaths and heartbreaks major and minor.  There is a sign in one of the places I go to meetings that says "There is nothing so bad that a drink can't make worse."..Iceman I'm so happy for you that you are hanging in there in spite of this shitstorm.  chemical excursions from life aren't the answer here and you are doing great!  The trick is to know that things change and feelings do too...Well done friend well done.
Try to remind yourself that this too shall pass everyday is a little bit better even if you cannot see it at the moment.  And give it time for this too shall pass.  Stay strong.  
Wow!! This is a powerful post iceman77. ..Thanks for the inspiration! I have slipped on and off since 2013 and for no good reason. I was letting my AV call the shots and I'm sick and tired of it...I didn't drink yesterday and I won't drink today! 
If you finally don't want to drink anymore I hope that you find the way...The longer I'm sober the less I feel honest about blaming alcohol on any of the behaviors other than **"More ONE AIN'T ENOUGH"** and having to drink until it's done...All the lying the drama the trauma the crime is something I did alcohol is just a chemical I made the excuses maybe my sick head made the excuses but it was never ethanol. I'm the  one with the brain nervous system will to live not alcohol...I used to think things happen in threes...I used to have hard rules that life had to fit...Something that has provided a huge weight off my shoulders is telling myself *"Well you could be wrong."*..&gt;There isn't anything that will make me drink again...I've said this to my innermost self twice. At the end of years of drinking woke up to say "What the fuck?! I was never going to get like this again!?" I don't doubt that you've had enough. Life has a way of hammering away at my resolve. I needed some serious help to find a way to live so that I could stand by and stay stopped even if my resolve is destroyed because sometimes I have no defense I'm helpless I can't anymore I don't have the fight in me I give up I roll over I'm dead inside and the only thing that ever worked when I got like that is a drink...Then I wake up years later and say "WTF!??! I was never going to get like this ever again!?!"..I don't have to do this alone any longer no one does. I found that doing Alcoholics Anonymous helps me...Good luck.
So many times I have said "that's it! no more". Praying that I would not get drunk today only to be pounded by 10 am...I had no idea how to stop drinking I knew I could not do it on my own and that something outside of myself would have to get me sober if it was to be...I spent time in Jail multiple times detoxs and hospitals. I went to halfway houses and tried Antabuse. None of it worked...I was homeless and drunk before it became fashionable and in my early 20's. This was in the early eighties after I have been fired from the Army for being a drunken lunatic...I woke up in a place in Denver lovingly called "The Snake Pit" aka Denver Cares another time and one of the staff there asked me "What are you going to do"...For the first time I had no idea at all and it scared the hell out of me...I was a few weeks before my 25th birthday had been living on the streets since I got out of the Army at 18 and had never completed a damn thing...I ended up going to a long term treatment center in Ypsilanti Michigan called Dawn Farm. Detox was "Grab a shovel and clean the Chicken Coop". ..I was ever so sick in my life then they made us do "yoga". I thought I was going to die...This was in 1983 and I have been sober since...Phredex has very little to do with my sobriety just go to meetings and live as good a life as I can...In early sobriety I got VERY involved in Young Peoples AA ICYPAA MCYPAA Went to the conferences and the dances helped on the convention committee's. ..These commitments kept me sober for years because people were counting on me and for the first time I cared enough to not want to let them down...Jump in with both feet you will not be bored and your life will become so much better that you cant imagine it...I promise.
Wow sorry about your family. You know a lot of people would see all those problems as reasons to drink. Glad you can see through it. The reality that alcohol will just make our already complicated lives more complicated and difficult to deal with and hurt the people closest to us. . . .You can do it. Stay strong. PM me if you ever need to vent/chat.
Now you really know that nothing will force you to drink. I had some of those lessons. Painful but worth it. Take care of yourself. 
With all due respect in my opinion the list is irrelevant.   ..With all due respect my opinion is irrelevant.  ..Stay sober for one more day.   ..Repeat.  .
Good to see you again Iceman! I'm sorry all those things have been happening and my thoughts go out to you that's some heavy stuff. But you've managed to use it for good and to help you stay sober and that's amazing. I kind imagine you standing on the edge of a cliff beating your chest and screaming "Yeah universe I'm staying sobbbberrrrr!!" Congrats on those 12 days and I will not drink with you today. Stay safe &amp; strong fellow sobie and my thoughts are with you. 
Debriefing when the shit hits the fan is not a pity party it's vital to share what's going on. That's some fine clarity you have going on iceman77. .. I'm glad you're with us. 
Sorry the shit's raining down on you...but then again shit always happens to us all (not trying to minimize what you're going through...).  Just remember that it's much easier to deal with it all sober.  Your head's clearer you're less likely to totally beat yourself up.....Just stay sober...just today.  Tomorrow will deal with itself.
It sounds like you figured it out! I was sober for 5 months once and then relapsed over (a lot of things but culminating with the suicide of a good friend two hours after I last saw him.) I got sober 3 days after the funeral again because drinking didn't make it any better and I just couldn't do it again...Two weeks later a friend in my grad cohort died from an undiagnosed heart condition. Then my step mom who is 10x of awesome and a type 1 diabetic ends up in the ICU because of a stupid boss. Then my dad has emergency surgery. I lose my job and can't find a new one. I get really sick doctors can only figure out I'm now super (randomly anemic and not absorbing potassium/magnesium well) and I fail a class in my first year of grad school. And my boyfriend &amp; I break up. All within 4 months. And that doesn't include the ex boyfriend who stalks me &amp; tries to sexually humiliate me by telling everyone fake details about our personal relationship (that I had to talk to my dean about because it was embarrassing to go to class with a row of graduate student men snickering and other people asking me on dates assuming I was into all that!) it doesn't include the rest of the family regular drama. ..Those first 4 months sober after so recently failing sucked. But! I stayed sober! Noting is worth drinking ever again. And exactly a week ago I celebrated 3 years sober (and I just turned 27.) So it's possible and you're doing it!! Congrats and keep going!
I admire your fortitude iceman. If you can stay sober through all of that you can stay sober period...I've gone through some difficult things sober but I don't have a comparatively significant list of horrible things I didn't drink over (yet) only thousands of little things that I didn't drink over. That's still progress for me though because I used to drink over thousands of little things and a few things a little worse...Thanks for the inspiring post. It certainly helped me stay sober another day right along with you.
I am fucking the universe with you - right up the bum!..Staying sober together for the next two dozen :)
