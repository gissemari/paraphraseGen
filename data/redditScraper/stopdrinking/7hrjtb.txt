It seems I have a hard time accepting that sometimes it's OK to take some down time from work and responsibilities.  ..My old strategy was to drink and feel that I was doing "something"...How do I just accept that's it's OK at times to goof off and not be working 24/7 without drinking?

I have some fantastic news for you - you get to figure out just what the hell it is that you like to do for fun!..It took me a while to discover what I like to do when I'm not drinking or drinking as a companion activity. Minigolf running (sort of lol) weight lifting xbox writing etc. The limit is your imagination...I don't have any advice on how to accept that though - I'm a lazy bird whose default is "chill out" ha
I can definitely relate. I was really hard for me to just relax at first. Are there any activities that help you get out of your head? Walking really helped me early on.
