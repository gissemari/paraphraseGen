It's not like I've been binging for the past two years it started off slow. Slowly but surly it became a daily thing again. I was working a lot of hours at the time so could only really drink in the evens so didn't see it as a problem. ..About 6 months ago I lost my job probably no fault of my own. ..Since then I've kind of just spiralled out of control. The drink wasn't cutting it anymore so I turned to using drugs again. ..Anyway long story short. I have an appointment to see my doctor tomorrow and I'm terrified...I have a tendency to present myself very well nice clothes smile and pretend like everything's ok. Over the years under pressure I'm become very good a lying. I need to completely open up to this guy admit I have a problem and become clean as a whistle again. ..Rant over! Sorry for rambling it's 2am here in the U.K. and my minds just racing about how it's all going to play out.  ..I'm 24 and I just want my life back.

My doctor was very helpful with me. I was terrified and crying going into the appointment. I was crying when I left too but felt a huge weight off my shoulder. You're on the right track. I hope your appointment goes well (I suspect it will!) and I think you'll feel much better tomorrow.
Good for you! I'll be thinking of you!
You got this. Keep us posted. 
Perfect timing!   Alcohol withdrawal can be fatal.   Medical supervision can make it a bit  safer.
