It's the middle of August. My last drink was before Christmas. That's pretty good. ..But before that I stopped in February. I managed a few days. I managed 30 days. At one point I managed 56 days. But I kept relapsing. I decided to moderate. Then I have up on the moderation. A year of relapses. ..However I realised they weren't relapses. ..It's been over 20 years of drinking. It takes a long time to unlearn that. They were just points where I learnt what my triggers are how my friends will react how to deal with parties and events what to say to people who ask if I want a drink. ..So if it happens to you it's not great. But learn the lessons and move on. It is possible.

I tell people on this sub a lot. A slip is okay. What matters is if you get back up on the horse. Looks like you did and its working out for you!
