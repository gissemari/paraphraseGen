Does anyone else struggle with sleep issues since getting sober? I certainly have and almost 2 years in I'm still trying to figure out ways to get a really good night's sleep. ..For about the first year and a half of sobriety I was able to fall sleep no problem but my sleep was never refreshing. My ex told me that I'd toss and turn all night expending energy when I should have been getting rest. I got a sleep study done and was diagnosed with hypersomnia but they couldn't find a reason for my chronic exhaustion. The doctor tried pushing amphetamines on me! Ha! That wasn't happening  ..Recently though I've been having trouble FALLING asleep. I broke up with my girlfriend and moved out and now I'm living out of a single room that I'm renting in a townhouse. As soon as I lay down to fall asleep I get hit with a real panicked feeling and have to spend the next hour meditating and trying to reassure myself that I'm not going crazy. I'd be lying if I told you it doesn't take its toll on my mental health. ..My therapist postulates that it's because I have complex PTSD from my childhood (later exacerbated by excessive drug and alcohol abuse). I take melatonin before bed and I do try to exercise on top of the work I do outside every day. But goddamn do I wish I could figure out this issue. I envy those who's sleep improved when they got clean! ..Can anyone else relate? And if so how have you been able to improve your sleep?

I'm only on Day 2 so I cannot speak to sleep quality in relation to length of sobriety. But I do relate because one of the ways I'd always let myself accept a drink when I was half-heartedly trying to "cut down alcohol consumption" was I'd remember that I sleep well and can get up on time if I've been drinking but on alcohol free days I'd always oversleep and I'd never wake up feeling refreshed. Obviously I know deep down inside that it's probably because my body is doing lots of repairs on those sober sleeps.... But the mind is not to be trusted. Good luck with trying to get good sleep I'm rooting for you.
