Last Sunday I binged really hard. I'm a heavy beer drinker but I moved to hard liquor that evening with some friends and I went way too far. I drove home speeding the whole way with my girlfriend in passenger seat. I was swerving a lot but not caring. How could I do that? She is the most precious thing in my life. I love her more than anything. That's not the person I want to be. I've sworn to her so many times that I would always protect her but in that instance I am her biggest threat. Fuck me for that. I haven't had a drop since then. I've made a promise to her that I won't. This weekend has been hard I made it through last night fairly easily but today has been a struggle. I want to go buy a 12 pack so bad but I won't. For her and for me. I believe in myself and I believe in all of us. This subreddit gives me hope and makes me feel proud. Thank you all for listening and bless you all on your sobriety and desires for such.
