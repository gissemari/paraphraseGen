And I have my wife to thank. I had almost 2 months under my belt but had a "screw it" moment which led to a week-long period of daily drinking that I was terrified to tell my wife about. She knew about my problem and I knew she was proud of my period of sobriety but all I could think about was disappointing her and having her decide she couldn't handle someone like me. ..I finally broke down sobbing and admitted my failures and she was (as always) so incredibly understanding and supportive. I was so scared of myself and her opinion of me but it turns out all she wants to do is be part of my support and allow me to feel like I can tell her anything. I'm incredibly lucky...It took me too long to realize that in hiding my relapses and weak moments from other people and trying to get back in the fight on my own I wasn't protecting their feelings I was only hurting myself and my chances for strengthening my recovery. Honesty with yourself is inseparable from honesty with others...For some reason this time feels different. I will not drink with y'all today!

Yay! That's awesome. You are 100% right. We get traction in recovery when we get real with ourselves and others.
