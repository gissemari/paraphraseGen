Day 16: today was a nightmare of a day - really one of those days that made me want to grab a bottle of wine and a dozen doughnuts for myself. But by the end of the night I found a very different reward: realizing that if I hadn't had a huge bill at the mechanic and if I hadn't found out at the last minute that I couldn't pay with my emergency Amex forcing me to overspend on my checking account (and if I hadn't sent a check to finally pay off my medical bill last week) and if I hadn't had to call my mom and ask for financial help for the first time since college and if I hadn't left my checkbook at home preventing a direct account transfer and if I hadn't had to stay at work extra late and if I hadn't discovered the problem with my car still wasn't fixed prompting me to take the time to record it on my phone and if my phone weren't a brick that took forever to load google maps and if Walgreens had updated their google results and I hadn't gone to a location claiming to have a Western Union that didn't and if I hadn't taken a million wrong turns getting to the only WU that was still open and if I hadn't been transferred a different amount than originally agreed upon preventing the WU agent from completing the transfer and if I hadn't had to call my sleeping parents a bajillion times and eventually call my amazing brother (and if I hadn't overheard the correct amount and if he hadn't gone along with my act in front of the WU Agents) and if I hadn't missed the first bank on my way home and if I hadn't mistaken the bank I ended up at for the one with a drive through ATM I wouldn't have ended up at the back of the restaurant where some fellow human being was having a far worse day than I was and I wouldn't have had the opportunity to reach out and say "Hey do you need a hug?" I wouldn't have been able to give him a moment to breathe freely after losing faith in humanity and I wouldn't have been able to reinforce his hope for the existence of good people on earth. I needed that hug just as much as he did and I am so glad we got to share in the vulnerable and limitless empathetic kindness of the human race and understand how it can be magnified by the ridiculously endless struggles of living life.

awwww. I am sorry your day was such a mess but I am totally blown away by your simple gesture that completely changed both you and your fellow human beings day/night.  You are an amazing person and I am glad you are sober to spread the love and I am proud to be in a community with you lol. ..I am a bit of a Harry Potter Geek and this reminded me of the quote:."Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light".You were the light for yourself and for another :)..High Five
This brought tears to my eyes! Isn't it funny how life works?? That kind of appreciation is wonderful... thanks for sharing :)
