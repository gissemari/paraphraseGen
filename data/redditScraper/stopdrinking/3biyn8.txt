I hope I can hold onto this feeling. ..Last week I got promoted. I went out with coworkers who all got slammed that night. I just sat there eating mozzarella sticks as their speech started to slur and one of them was hugging the toilet. I was the only one to make it into work the next day - brownie points. ..Saturday an old friend who moved away came back. We used to be wine buddies - I actually never over did it with her because she always stayed pretty sober. I told her I wasn't drinking anymore so we took our dogs for a walk instead. ..Sunday I went out bowling and everyone was drinking beer but I was cool with my ginger ale. ..I wasn't struggling. ..I wasn't tempted. ..Something clicked in me the night I found an unopened bottle of vodka and poured it out - even though I was alone in the house. I laughed in the kitchen for like 3 - 4 minutes just.....overjoyed with myself. That feeling has carried through every day since. ..This morning I woke up my husband and I have been doing great. I made some breakfast for him in the morning which previously I was too hung over to do. Scrambled eggs and toast. He told me I look like a different person and he just needed to step back a little to see it. I have never had a better compliment. ..I feel amazing. ..I feel empowered. ..I feel different. ..I think I've started to like myself again. ..Just wanted to let the world know ..**update** one of the things I truly miss from the old days was trivia night at this bar/pub that's dog friendly. I decided I was in control enough to not order my typical special drinks. You can do this! I said. You're a badass! I said. And I did not drink! Not today! As an awesome and unexpected bonus Alllllll those times where I was drunk and said "it's on the tip of my tongue" came out tonight correctly! My team ended up 4th/32. I was DD and I had a fucking blast. ..**Omg you guys. Omg**..*oh oh oh -- I left out the best part. My husband came with me!!! This used to be a secret activity that I did when he was away! I turned something unhealthy into something awesome!*
