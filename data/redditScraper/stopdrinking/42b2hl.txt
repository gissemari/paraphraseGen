One of my moments of insight came after I made a ridiculous post here that was passive aggressive and semi-incoherent. I was super tired I have been working insane hours. Being tired makes me super grumpy I feel bad about how I act and ***chaching*** a trigger for relapse risk. I didn't. I grabbed the journal my therapist and all you dinos told me to use. I recognized so many things about myself in that page and a half that I wrote. Things I  used alcohol to cover. Alcohol was like the Langoliers instead of eating lost time it ate bad things and feeling I had about myself. So....yes I will keep the journal bad entries and all. .I hated journaling as much as I hated the thought of trying to find a better AA experience than I had before. .SO My big positive step for the week is journaling and liking it. Maybe next week or so (after I change my hours and even employment) I will begin a search for a group. We will see. .Thank you all for putting up with incoherent overly emotional passive aggressive insanity on my part. I am growing and learning from you all. .Now I have a date! Stay warm and sober.

lol sounds a lot like me haha. Congrats on journaling. I have my therapist appointment Monday so I am waiting to see if she is telling me to do one on specific things or what not. I too am switching jobs.... well I am leaving the current one and have applied to others but everything has been closed due to the snow storm here. Anyway Congrats on over a month that is terrific! &amp; on your big positive step this week :)..High Five
Journaling is a great idea.  Maybe I would put all my grumpy overly-sensitive BS in there instead of taking it out on my husband.
