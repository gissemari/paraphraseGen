Woohoo I relapsed but I made it back upon the sober train. Ditched some old habits and threw all the alcohol out. ..And I have been successful in not hoarding any alcohol secretly. I was keeping a beer or two in the closet even at 156 days a while ago. My mind is so past alcohol in some ways. Know those who are just starting out you can change..That's all I really have to say. I'm just happy and thankful....Keep it up everyone!

Congrats!
Cool! Glad you made it back.
Good work /u/xxfivefiresxx -- too often the relapsers don't make it back even with initial resolution.  Thanks for showing it can be done.  
Progress being made.  Good work.
Glad you're here with us. Congrats!
Welcome back!
I too have relapsed and know how difficult it can be to admit that I probably should not drink again - it's just something that's not good for me and causes some serious difficulties in my life.  However since doing that my life has gotten progressively better and better even if I have had some serious set backs or bad days...Welcome back and I hope you hang in there.  It's worth all the effort.
There's plenty of room on the sober train glad you made it back :)
