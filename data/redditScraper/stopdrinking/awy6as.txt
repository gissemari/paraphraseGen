I'm in a funk. Lately I've had to drag myself out of bed in the mornings and just prefer to be alone in my misery not wanting to face life. I have been feeling so restless and anxious and ramped up my drinking to get away from those feelings. As you all know it hasn't helped. My problems won't go away with wine. ..There has to be relief from these feelings though so I'm reaching out for recommendations on meditation tips or videos or podcasts. What do you turn to for relief from life's struggles?..Thanks for being here all.

I swim go to yoga AA meetings therapy and catch up with friends.
I think for me just accepting it was going to be a slow road helped. I think it took maybe 3 months for my mood to fully even out now I pretty much never suffer from depression or anxiety which constantly plagued me when I was drinking...I guess if you can just think of it as part of the process and not be too hard on yourself you will find it gradually eases. Long baths early nights and Netflix helped too...You have made such a great decision I promise you will get through this hard part and it shouldn't take too long either x
I turned to a therapist treatment and involvement in AA. This is how I learned to have the sober happy life I have today. ..In the sidebar of this subreddit you will find the Saturday Share stories. Reading them helped me a great deal. 
This Naked Mind either book form or on Audible has been a big help for me.  You got this.  
Yoga. Cook n eat good food. Spend time with sons. Jog. Write. Date
'Why buddhism is true' by Robert Wright is a good general introduction to mindfulness meditation from a western perspective. Simple breathing meditation takes 5 minutes to learn but you need to do it every day.
