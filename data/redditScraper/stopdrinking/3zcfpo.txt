Last time I quit drinking I went through a couple of weeks of hell with withdrawals. I completely "forgot" about that experience when I decided to relapse over the holidays. This time around it's not nearly as bad because I only drank for about 5 days not all in a row and I drank less than I did in the past (but I'm sure that would escalate quickly if I kept up the drinking)...Although the withdrawals aren't nearly as bad it's still incredibly uncomfortable. The anxiety the restlessness the constant feeling of doom. I can't make clear decisions and I keep second-guessing the ones I do make. I constantly feel like I did something terribly wrong or that something terrible has happened and I can't shake that feeling from the back of my mind. Of course a drink or 5 would quickly kick that can down the road if I wanted to take the easy way out. But it's not really the easy way is it? Drinking is the hard way in the long run...I know that it will improve over the next days and weeks but I can't wait for this feeling to go away. Just wanted to vent a bit. It actually did make me feel a bit more calm. Deep breaths!

Hang in there.  You might want to consider that when we go back to drinking we [kindle the effects of withdrawal when we stop again.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiryIy4_o7KAhUGVyYKHcNTA6AQFggcMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fpubs.niaaa.nih.gov%2Fpublications%2Farh22-1%2F25-34.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNEeLY4zkG3DpDKodveqzshwj4pHcQ&amp;sig2=WTdcjIvvEjJhinfsgEnkYw&amp;bvm=bv.110151844d.eWE)
Just think: once you get through this you never have to go through it again :)
I'm feeling very cranky myself on day 2.
&gt;The anxiety the restlessness the constant feeling of doom. I can't make clear decisions and I keep second-guessing the ones I do make. I constantly feel like I did something terribly wrong or that something terrible has happened..This is how I felt all the time while I was still drinking. It finally got better after I was sober a few months.
Just last night I was shaking and jerking around in my bed scared of my own shadow. Today is a lot better. Just give it a little time. I've been through it many times. 
Same here.  This is a horrible place to be and at least we can work to make this the last time we go through it.
Hang in there. During my first two weeks I wrote out all the reasons I quit. I read it every now and then to remind me that I'm doing the right thing by not drinking.  I can't remember what a hangover feels like after a few days without alcohol.
