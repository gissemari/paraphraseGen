I found this sub yesterday and haven't been able to get it off my mind its so inspirational. I would like to start off by saying thank you and congratulations to everyone who has some time under their belt truly inspirational to everyone still struggling I offer my support. we can do this!..Who am I? I don't know anymore. I suppose this started when I first started drinking with my best friend at the age of 16. we didn't drink a lot per se but when we did I would try to drink the most I would get so drunk I'd end up puking or making a complete fool of myself and his family hates me now because of it. 8 years later and I'm better at controlling myself. still don't know my limit all the time but my body is conditioned to not puke and keep everything down. unless its the day after and I wake up before work and routinely evacuate the contents of my stomach. but am I an 'alcoholic'? I function well. I hold down a great job in logistics I'm a manager I'm a Boyfriend (common law) I'm a friend I'm a brother son and I pay all -- ok most of my bills on time. I function well in society. but I'm a drinker I live pay cheque to pay cheque and never have extra money because any extra money I do have goes to drinking -- I would like to point out though if I don't have money to drink (I.E money set aside for bills) I don't drink. Two years ago I decided to stop drinking / felt like I was an alcoholic because I noticed that I was drinking every night and my girlfriend and friends didn't. Anything we did together I would drink - my wonderful girlfriend never said anything about me drinking too much or that she didn't like it. I came to this decision on my own and she has been fully supportive of me except maybe when I was quitting she wouldn't stop me from having a drink and caving in but would make sure I knew I would be giving up everything I had been working towards. This decision to stop drinking only lasted 3 weeks the first time in this time I started going to AA and it wasn't for me at all in fact it almost scared me some of the people their completely ruined their lives and have done some pretty horrible things while drinking and I understood why they were there. but the problem was I didn't fit in I felt ashamed to be there here I am a 22-Year-old (at the time) young adult who functions well and hasn't done anything to ruin his life because of alcohol. I felt as though I was taking away from their resources and was no help to anyone there so I stopped going 2.5 weeks later. I decided that I would control this on my own   it didn't last long. but admittingly I felt amazing having not drank for that time period I felt better when I woke up. I slept better I had more energy I wasn't grumpy I truly felt a new love for life.  Now 2 years later I'm 25 and still on and off with quitting if i decide I'm drinking too much and will try to limit myself. But as soon as I taste it   that all goes out the window. Usually I'll do 1 week or 2 week spurts.  I don't know who or what I am. Am I an alcoholic? I don't feel very much like an alcoholic because from AA I have this tainted idea of what an alcoholic is. that an alcoholic has hit the bottom. They've lost jobs relationships homes they've destroyed their lives. I suppose that's a pretty shitty way for me to view it though. Yesterday was the first time in awhile where I didn't really have money but decided I was going to get some wine. Maybe not my proudest moment. I don't know if I truly want to quit though (maybe that's the addiction speaking?) I keep telling myself  I just need to control it     I can control this   this is a non issue . Do or have any of you felt the same as me? Am I an alcoholic? Am I just   borderline? I think im looking for advice or someone to shake me and say  you an alcoholic. You need to get your act together!  I know its said your always an alcoholic   even after you quit. But I don't know. What do you think? Where do I go from here? I don't really know what im expecting to hear from all of you. I simply don't know much I guess. Thanks for taking the time out of your day to read this. Keep up the good fight =).
----------immediate responses--------

I don't care about the label. Alcohol was affecting me in negative ways...Oddly enough I came to the realization that I actually was an alcoholic once I tried to stop drinking. It became painfully obvious how dependent I had become both mentally and physically...I see no shame in admitting this. I became addicted to an addictive substance...I drank for thirty years. Never lost a job. Many promotions. Roof over my head. Wife. Kids. Etc...My life is dramatically better without alcohol. With or without the label I will continue down the path of sobriety.
