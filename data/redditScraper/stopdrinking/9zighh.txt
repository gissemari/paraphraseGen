  ..I apologize for the wall of text the cross-post and the throwaway but I could really use some support. Thank you in advance...Earlier this year I had 6 months sober in AA. Near the end I was feeling so amazing. But I was smoking a little weed from time to time. Maybe once every 2 weeks. I confided in a friend in AA about it and she promptly informed me that I'd relapsed so I ended up getting drunk...I figured it would be a quick slip and I would get back on track. But coming back to the rooms was hard. I made it a month then drank then another month then drank and so on...I knew I needed to do something. But I am having a hard time relating to others in AA. I don't drink because I had issues as a child or because I hate life or because my boss is a dick. I drink because I am biologically addicted to alcohol. This is likely because of growing up with friends who binge drank. I also have my own business and generally LOVE life...I tried the Sinclair method which studies show can reverse addiction to alcohol by blocking the endorphins using medication over time. The same has been done for years with smokers. I haven't always taken the pill though and have been to the ER a handful of times to get Ativan to help me detox. ..I desperately want AA to work for me but I can't get my stubborn head around certain things:..\- I'm told  not to think because I'm not equipped . I've owned 2 tech businesses that I started from scratch before the age of 30. ..\- My last sponsor made me inventory every single sexual partner I've ever had and what happened. I was a bit weirded out by this and feel embarrassed now...\- I got to step 5 before but didn't feel any different after...\- I hate the idea of being powerless for the rest of my life when I have seen evidence of things like The Sinclair Method literally curing people of their Alcohol Use Disorder. The obvious thing being that if I chose not to take the medication on several occasions I might be an  alcoholic ...\- On that note there is no medical diagnosis for being an  alcoholic . The DSM has something called Alcohol Use Disorder which is not a black and white thing. It's a spectrum...\- I don't believe I am a so-called mental defective. I think that term as well as identifying as  an alcoholic  at every meeting is detrimental to mental health. ..With all that said. I can't deny that the net end result of my 6 months in AA doing the steps had me at the best I have been in a long time. ..I want to quit drinking. I love my friends in AA. I just can't seem to shut my brain off.

 Fuck that person. Fuck anyone's rules. Smoke your weed. Your one rule should be not to drink...If AA's judging led to a relapse maybe they aren't what you need
If AA isn't the right 'fit' why not try one of the other options like SMART Refuge Recovery LifeRing etc?..I've never been to AA this sub has been my only support group and it's worked great so far... AA is certainly far from being the only option.....I find I have all the power in the world over alcohol as long as it remains *outside* of my body but no power to change the fundamental chemical interaction between the drug alcohol and my brain... works for me.....I also don't define myself as an 'Alcoholic' (whatever that is); that's not essential either... I had a severe Alcohol Use Disorder which I no longer have because I don't drink... (I know how I could *get* an AUD again *really* quickly though!).....&gt;I confided in a friend in AA about it and she promptly informed me that I'd relapsed..How extraordinarily presumptuous of her.....I still smoke weed occasionally in full awareness of the potential risks of doing so (given that addicts who continue to use any of the mood-altering substances are statistically more likely to relapse back onto the primary drug of choice at some point) and don't find that it makes me want to drink in the slightest... Your mileage may vary!..I have trouble shutting my brain off too sometimes... listening to the 'Dharma Punx' podcasts (consisting of a talk on some aspect of the neuroscience or psychology of addiction followed by a guided meditation) has been really helpful for this.....Best of luck with whatever you decide to do!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt; 
Keep trying. You'll find the right fit in AA with willingness some openness and time. It's worth it. As you said you were your best after those 6 months. The program works. I'm in San Diego if you want to chat.
I haven't tried AA but the group you went to sounds irritating. I have read posts on here that  describe  wide variations in group dynamics so you might see if you find a better fit. In My area there is only 1 so I hope you have more to pick from. Keep on trying to find some sort of support that fits for you. We are not one size fits all in recovery. 
In my experience i can only get help if im willing to help myself. Instead of running around in circles talking about what is stopping you getting help use that time &amp; energy to find &amp; form a solution. You just gotta be willing
&gt;I love my friends in AA.  I just can't seem to shut my brain off...I understand!  I've gone through most of my life thinking !!..I'm not responsible for my thoughts....  I don't completely control what I think....  Thank God...  or I'd be arrested at times!..I'm not responsible for my thoughts I am responsible for my actions.  ..I don't find particularly useful the "Hi I'm an alcoholic"....   Sometimes I say "Hi I'm PG and grateful to be sober today"...Labeling myself as mental defective is counter productive for my success.  Much of my thinking brought me significant success.  ..What I need support with is when my "thinking" is taking over ....  ..&gt;The idea of being powerless for the rest of my life..I'm not powerless in life.  ..The dynamic of my life is Thinking -&gt; Beliefs -&gt; Choices/Decisions -&gt; Actions -&gt; Results/Consequences.   I employ feedback loops based on the results I obtain...In that whole chain of thinking-beliefs-choices-actions-results the only thing I Control COMPLETELY is my next choice.  ..I am similarly more powerful than ALL the alcohol in the World that is **outside** my body...I decide to take a drink the only unimpaired choice I make is the first one - To have the first drink.  ..After that all my choices are subject to me being impaired.  I have enough data to know that once the alcohol is **inside** me I have yielding power to the alcohol to make subsequent choices. And Alcohol always chooses more...With regard to AA it provides a great support network.  ..I take what I need and leave the rest..
I am like you.  I drink the way I drink because it's just how I am.  Took 32 years of trying to prove otherwise before I finally asked for help and was pointed to AA...I've worked the steps and have had a spiritual awakening.  I have a new set of tools for dealing with life.  I've come to learn that I only have power over my actions and my attitudes and that's plenty for me to manage.  I try to work in partnership with the universe now as opposed trying to fix it.  ..I do take medication for depression.  My motivation is healing and presence.  I don't need other substances to escape anymore because being in the present moment is ok now.  
I have the same exact problem with AA. I always  take what I like and leave the rest  but it's hard to  leave the rest  when those things are in some way detrimental. Nothing gave me more hope and relief that finding that there were other options outside of aa. I still go occasionally but I also use SMART this reddit page the book/website   the naked mind  and just doing my own personal research. All of these things make a cocktail of support that help me personally. And it also makes it easier for me to accept the help of AA and to be able to ignore what I don't like about it. Best wishes to you this really sucks!
