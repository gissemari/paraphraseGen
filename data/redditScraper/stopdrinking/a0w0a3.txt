After some deep soul searching I believe that my problem drinking stems largely from trying to escape pain. Emotional pain in my case. Everyone has pain of some sort I am sure I can see my entire family struggling in one way or another with it.   .The question is am I willing to put in the upfront work to handle that pain? ...Because postponing it with alcohol is a never-ending loop of pain: I feel some hard feelings but I don't want to feel them so I numb them out but it barely works and I end up a wreck of missing memories making my life more complicated and more painful and then I'm suffering NEW mental and physical pain due to hangovers and withdrawal and addiction. Then the worst part is... that original pain? Well it's still there! Because I never dealt with it to begin with.  ..I am ready to deal with the pain now. I want to feel it. I see it I accept it and I don't want to live trapped inside it anymore.   ..Thank you all of you for being here as a very valuable community.  IWNDWYT.

That is a great quote. 
When you are feeling that long awaited pain be sure to hug yourself.  We are allowed to feel these emotions.  Good job!!  IWNDWYT.
Great quote! For me sobriety is just one part of my attempt to really face life as a creator instead of a victim. And this takes feeling feelings and taking a good hard look at reality. And honestly yes in part I am motivated by wanting to give my kids a better future by leading by example.
Well said!
