This afternoon I was at home and started to get that anxious feeling that used to be an everyday feeling for me. That feeling would lead to the never ending cycle of drinking to ease the anxiety which led to more anxiety once the buzz ended and the hangover kicked in...I thought out this craving today instead of getting into my car for a ride to the liquor store I sat on my couch breathed it out and kept telling myself that this will pass...It did pass I'm sober and I'm now in my car waiting for my AA meeting to start. If I picked up I wouldn't be in a good place right now would be on the path to losing everything because I don't have another relapse/recovery in me. This is it and I made a pledge to not drink today...Day 43 is another good sober day.

Way to go! It's been day at a time for me especially early on. One day is not so hard to do! A few minutes ago I realised today is my fifth anniversary.... Still it is only as good as one more day without a drink. ..I sure won't drink with you today! .
Awesome!
I wish there was a physical manifestation of every time we battle back the beast. There is physical evidence of when we relapse (dui broken relationships extra weight blotchy skin bruises from falls broken household objects dents in walls horrifying text messages lost time fatty liver messed up bowels etc). Way to go OP.
Way to go!! Best Wishes.... DDAGTM
Great job!
Excellent Job!!  For me the more times I resisted the urge the less power I gave it and the easier it got.  Keep up the good work!
I did too. :) Yay us! On to another sober day!
Keep it up.
