So im new here but here a quick summary of my story. Ive been drinking since college Im now 28 years old and Probably havent had gone more than 7 days without drinking since. Ive been gifted enough to get through life as a "functional" alcoholic. But in the past few months ive been drinking 6-7 times a week... but I am now 6 days sober and im extremely happy and productive. The main reason Im sober is because i moved 1000 miles away for work. I dont have my friends and family around. That being said tomorrow we have an outing for work (to celebrate the new start and blah blah). Im afraid ill drink and maybe I should just stay in (specially since its only been 6 days). Ive been trying to quit for 3 years and I usually make it to about this many days before i relapse... So here I am awake in the middle of the night going through forums to find help...
