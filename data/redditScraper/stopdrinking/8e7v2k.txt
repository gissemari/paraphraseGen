This sort of fits in with Eminem's 10 year sober-versary but I love hearing music from the recently sober: records that were made as they were struggling to be clean.  Do you have any favorites to share that reflect all of our struggles with substances?..This morning I discovered the Strokes third album "First Impressions of Earth" which seems like it was recorded right after they started to sober up around 2006.  The lyrics are just what I am going through and I feel like I'm like a teenager identifying with love songs on the radio!  ..Sample lyric from "On the Other Side": .I hate them all I hate them all.I hate myself for hating them.So I'll drink some more I love them all I'll drink even more.I'll hate them even more than I did before..Got any more to share with me?

Johnny Cash man. Not exactly newly sober but the struggle is in every single word he says. And his autobiography is fantastic. 
Check this out: https://youtu.be/580SsnoG344..By a group that had a #1 country hit but this song didn't get much playtime I don't think...The singer on the left was in recovery last I heard. ..**Note: video has some triggers (lots of bottles)**..
Maklemore! Especially his song  starting over 
Missio is a great band in recovery for recovery. 
Not an album but I love O.N.E. by Yeasayer. There's also music suggestions on the sidebar. 
Jason Isbell and the 400 unit!
