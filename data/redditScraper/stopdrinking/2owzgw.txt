Hi I want to reach out to my aunt who has been trying to stay clean for a while. She just can't seem to do it but wants it "so bad."..I can't imagine and I'd like to say the right things to her and..avoid anything "wrong." Some family members and immediate family members of hers seem to have given up on her...How can I encourage her? What would you like to have heard from someone while you were struggling?

Agree with Al-anon. From what you describe it sounds like she wants to want it. In my experience when people straight out want it they take action. If they want it badly they become willing to go to any lengths. There's precious little anyone else can do aside from setting healthy boundaries.
