This time it's with a sponsor from AA. ..I know I'm an alcoholic. ..I know alcohol is bad for me in all kinds of ways - mental health financial health physical health...I also know I can't get sober and stay sober by myself. I need other people to help...I don't love AA. The big book feels dated. The posters on the wall look old. The way we all talk is weird with our cliches and sayings - keep it in the day keep it simple let go etc...I don't like the god word. I'm an atheist when it comes to an interventionist god. There isn't a special plan for me. That's my ego talking...However it gives me structure company and a n opportunity to explore a broader spirituality of the unknown my powerlessness and my acceptance of how things are and questions that will forever remain unanswered so I can move on with my life...The acceptance of a power greater than myself also means I can accept alcohol is a power greater than me. I can stop trying to  defeat it . I can let it go...Anyhoo - it's going alright at the moment. Anyone who is struggling try a 12 step program for 90 days. Get a tough sponsor who will keep you accountable to doing simple thing daily to keep your active recovery on track...I can feel it working. That's all that matters...Viva stopdrinking! Addiction is a dirty business. Confusing and frustrating but solvable...I feel so much better without a drink. Happy sobriety. Peace between the ears. Calm. Pleasant. Relaxed. ..Love to you all.

Sounds good Simon  !  It's good to hear you're doing what you gotta do to chase sobriety down for yourself that's fantastic news buddy keep it up and I wish you all my best   
Your feelings about AA should have no bearing on the effectiveness of the program. I agree the language is dated and some of the conventions are lame I'm not an atheist but I can understand disliking god but the 12 steps are a program of action that requires no belief or agreement in order to work. You don't ever have to find god or like the big book you can still get results by putting in the actions. Good luck with it all and congratulations on 13 days you're doing great!
