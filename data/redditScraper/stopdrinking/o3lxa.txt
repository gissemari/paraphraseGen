Hi everyone!..Boy have we grown a lot in the last couple days! We've had more than 350 new members join our community since January 1st! That's a 30% increase in size almost overnight! We're at 1500 users now! (ok ok technically 1499 when I posted this but close enough! :P)..These [traffic graphs](http://i.imgur.com/JD7eG.png) and [detailed stats](http://i.imgur.com/3ZidV.png) tell the story better than words ever could! After [/r/stopdrinking](/r/stopdrinking) [was featured on the reddit blog](http://blog.reddit.com/2012/01/reddit-helps-with-your-new-years.html) we had almost 1000 unique visitors *an hour* come through the doors of our little subreddit!..I think it's terrific that we've got so many new members as every one of us has a unique perspective and our own unique insights to share! Diversity is our strength and more members means more people making positive life choices taking a stand against their problem drinking and getting the help and support they need to turn their lives around...Growing has it's challenges too. As the subreddit increases in size there's more potential for us to meet people who have different views that we might feel are incompatible with ours. The challenge to us all is to make the effort to look for the good in other people and try and find  the common threads that bring us all together here for support advice and encouragement...One of the most amazing things about this subreddit is that over the seven months we've been here there have been fewer incidents that required moderation than I could count on one hand. The community here is overwhelmingly gracious welcoming encouraging and supportive. That's a rare thing to find anywhere especially on the internet...It's you guys and your honesty and willingness to share that have really made this place such a valuable and important resource for so many people. I'm so happy and proud to be part of this community. I'm amazed every day by the courage and compassion I see displayed in the posts and comments here...I know as a community we've all just made it through a tremendously challenging time. The holidays are one of the most difficult times of year for anyone who's trying to deal with problem drinking. Whether we made it through the holidays sober or not the important thing is that we're all still here and we're working together to be better today than we were yesterday and better tomorrow than we are today...Over the next little while I hope that we can all go out of our way a little bit to offer some extra care and to support to the members who are struggling and who are maybe trying to get their feet under them again after the stress of the holiday season...If you're new to the community please make a post an introduce yourself! We're a friendly bunch and as you can see we love meeting new people! If you're still working up the courage to quit then that's ok too come and say hi and let us know how you're doing. We've all been there before! If you're not quite ready to join then that's ok too. We'll be here when you're ready!..So congrats again on being the most welcoming supportive encouraging community that I've ever been a part of. You are an inspiration and a joy to know and I look forward to discovering 2012 together with all of you..-Franks2000inchTV..P.S. The nominations for the [best of reddit awards](http://blog.reddit.com/2012/01/who-would-you-nominate-for-best-of.html) are open! If you can think of a community that might be a good candidate for [Best New Community](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bestof2011/comments/o1aai/nominate_best_new_community/) then you should go let them know!  (wink wink!)
