Hello. I've never posted anywhere like this before. Never been to a meeting. I'm a mum been through lots of changes in past 1.5 years and have struggled to moderate my drinking for the past year. I know I have a problem. I've a history of eating disorder and recovery. Most recently I had post-natal depression which has come back (due to the boozing I think). There is a strong genetic disposition to alcoholism in my family. .I drink at home sometimes with my husband sometimes alone. Not everyday. I know I have a problem and I need to stop. But I can't seem to do it on my own. I'm going to check in here because I've nobody else to check in with. I'm scared. Thanks for reading.

Keep checking in. Most of us don't do it in one go but knowing you're not alone makes a big difference...We'll always be here.
