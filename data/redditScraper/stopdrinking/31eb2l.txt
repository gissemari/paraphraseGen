He had over 9 months sober.  The last few weeks he's drifted away from what worked.  A series of unfortunate things happened while he was disconnected and he relapsed.  He finally reached out to me tonight.  I'm happy he's still alive and reached out.  Saddened he didn't reach out before he took that first drink.  Relieved he's ready to hit some meetings with me tomorrow. And grateful that *I'm* still sober through this.  We're all in this together.  We're not perfect.  Mistakes happen.  Tomorrow is a new day.

Thank goodness you were sober and able to be there. I'm so scared of that point of my sobriety. 
Sounds like he's got himself a good sponsor.  
I have a co-sponsor as well as a sponsor. I find that both help greatly and my sponsor strongly encouraged it. Glad to hear you are making the effort. Also glad to hear your sponsee is too.
A teacher told me that parenting has changed a lot and has made us hyper fearful of all slips and falls. She said that parents used to let their kids learn that things were hot and would burn them by letting them touch hot things and actually learn from the injury but wouldnt let them fall into a fire...I think about the journey of sobriety similarly some people need to scald their fingers and I am not going to stop them but I will have warned them. But I also won't let them destroy themselves without trying to intervene. Sounds like your sponsee has a solid sponser and that they have some wounds to tend to but that they actually learned and grew with their error.
