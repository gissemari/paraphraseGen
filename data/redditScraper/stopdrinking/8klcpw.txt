I was telling my husband today that I have spent my entire life struggling. It was like I was thrown in a river the moment I was born and with every year I was abused as a child and  with every trauma I suffered that river got swifter and more treacherous always leading towards a huge waterfall that spilled into an abyss. ..Because I was born to a "broken" mother \(she was schizophrenic and chose to self medicate with alcohol\) who married a Vietnam veteran with PTSD who also self medicated with alcohol I didn't learn to swim nor was I given a boat or a life raft.....I had to dog paddle half drown t taking on gulf of water along the way...By the time I was in my mid 30's I was bipolar suffering from PTSD from my own abuse and self medicating with alcohol. By the time I was in my 40's I was an epileptic who refused to treat ANY of my physical or mental illnesses. ..I will not go into the destruction of my life for it is a common theme for folks who suffer from mental illness and alcoholism as a result of self medicating said mental illnesses.  190 days ago I stopped that barreling down the river towards the abyss and reached out for the shore. DRY LAND!!!!!  It took a complete psychotic breakdown and though I have yet to hear from the court I am facing 2 felonies and a DUI because I refused to face the fact that I was mentally ill JUST LIKE my mother......just like my dead brother. He went over the raging waterfall and killed himself in 2008 at age 38. He never stopped drinking. He never got help for his mental illnesses. I never stopped dog paddling choking on the water but trying to stay afloat long enough to reach the shore.........and here I am..........It's been 190 days today.  I go to therapy every week for my PTSD and BiPolar/mood disorder  \(I guess that was MANIA and not just that I liked to talk a lot and was full of enormous amounts of energy......and had a bad temper sometimes....especially when drunk.\) I still fight the medications from the shrink...but when I am manic \(I am pretty sure this is what prompted the bad week that got me arrested that day. I didn't even have half my clothes on....didn't know where I was...don't remember a thing and my BAC wasn't that high.......\) and am back on my seizure medications. I am middle aged so the medical stuff seems to never end.....BUT I AM SOBER..........I made it to the shore and am on dry land............I just have to learn how to walk now on water logged legs  :\)

Man it sounds like you have had a hell of a time.  Good for you for fighting through it and approaching your issues with honesty!  Maybe those water logged legs will begin to dry out the longer you stay on land.  :-) I will not drink with you today!
   good job!!! I wish you all my best on your journey    .IWNDWYT
