Just wanted to say a quick thank you to this sub. I've been following it because of my boyfriend - how I can help him. He has struggled with alcohol for years and is not a happy drunk by any means. I had seen the book The Naked Mind recommended here many times so I bought it for us to both read. He has been reading it and just told me that he loves this book and he's so happy I bought it. It made my heart smile. So thank you all so much for all of the help. I appreciate it more than you all know.
