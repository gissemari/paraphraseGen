This is my fifth day sober today. I am just trying to take it one day at a time. I have started going to AA now. I am not sure if that is a good idea but I have liked it so far. The nicotine gum helps with the cravings. As long as I do not smoke I will not drink or that is what I tell myself. I am really struggling to find a purpose in this endeavor other than myself. This is my first time posting to this sub so if anyone could give me some advice I would appreciate it. I am trying to get to 30 days sober which will beat my record as an alcoholic for self-imposed sobriety. Thanks for reading.

I'm on day 5 too!  I found day 4 the worst for some reason.   Woke up irritated  went to work irratated came home irritated.  Kids asked if I was ok.  Had cravings that went over me like a wave then disappeared.  Had the best night sleep in years!  Woke up feeling great but not letting my guard down!  You can do this! * Also watched the documentary Fyre last night about a bunch of drunk people trying to plan a music festival.  Did not go well.  Stay strong!
My advice?  Stay quit now before you become like me - alcohol dependent...I scoffed at the term. Didn't understand that it was a real thing...12 days ago I had to chug down 2 full coffee cups of vodka to get out of bed.  Had to choke it down to not barf it up...I have not had a drink in 10 days.  I am finally FREE...IWNDWYT
Hey I'm only sober since Monday but I went to AA and 2 people came up to me afterwards and gave me their phone numbers. I am supposed to call one lady everyday at 5pm. Right now my purpose to stay sober is so that I can call that lady. And then to be sober for my 730pm meeting. So baby steps I guess try to find someone to be accountable to
