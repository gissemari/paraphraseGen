Relapsed lost my job missed a final project that caused me to fail a class &amp; ended up with the worst hangover I've ever had that lasted days. I'm ready to start over and stop drinking once again. Reddit I will not drink with any of you today. Or tomorrow. Or the next day. Welcome back sobriety! I'm very happy to be sober again. :)

It was a hangover from hell that was the final straw for me too.   You can do it!
Don't worry about tomorrow or the next day. One day at a time - a cliche but so true.
Glad you're back! Whenever I relapsed I tried different paths to sobriety. Anything we can do to help?
