I say imperfect because we have no way of knowing how many people with badges are still sober. ..So what good has SD done? I don't think I'd be sober if not for SD. I might even be dead.  If not for SD I wouldn't have met a whole slew of people whom I have come to consider my friends.  I have met some of them in real life and I'm sure I will meet others as our work and travel schedules continue to take us to each others' towns. ..Here's another example:  I had one long-time AA member tell me that SD has opened his eyes to the struggles many newcomers face.  For example before coming to SD he didn't realize how much God talk bothered some people. The guy wasn't trying to be insensitive it had just never occurred to him before.  Now when conversations go certain ways in his local meetings he speaks up and shares what he's learned here with his AA group.  ..Take a moment to comprehend the magnitude of that. Do you get it?  As one of the 17000 people here on SD listening talking and learning you are having an effect on hundreds or even thousands of real-life recovery groups. Somewhere out there a newcomer to a real-life group who has never even heard of reddit may have received a warmer reception because of the words you've take the time to share here.  And that warmer reception may have made the difference for him or her.  You have in essence changed someone's life.  ..I think that's pretty damned cool...---..**Question:  How has SD impacted your life?**..--- ..Whats New?..* Reddit is no longer displaying the individual up/down vote information for posts or comments.  [Announcement from the admins here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/28hjga/reddit_changes_individual_updown_vote_counts_no/)..* There's a new option in your reddit settings for a "controversial comment indicator."

[Here's more info.](http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/293oqs/new_reddit_features_controversial_indicator_for/)..* The SD sidebar now displays the number of new badge requests & badge reset requests for the previous 7 days.  It's listed in the "Badge" section.  These numbers will update each morning...* There was an effort a couple weeks ago to get some SD-related swag manufactured.

According to Wikipedia the earliest known evidence of warfare dates to around 13000 BCE.  [Guess where it was found?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUXLE9sbFN8)  Coincidentally this is also around the time of the [Holocene Extinction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction) which is "the extinction event of species that has occurred during the present Holocene epoch mainly due to human activity."  Go figure...When I first showed up here I never imagined that SD would ever have 7000 subscribers let alone 17000.  Wanna know the secret to SD's success?  Take a look in the mirror...Thanks for being so awesome everybody.   ..\m/  Keep it up! \m/...---..**Question:  What song is currently knocking around in your head?**....

Song:  [Sailing by Christopher Cross.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQeqmNbA2Hs)...Well it's not far down to Paradise  .At least it's not for me  .And if the wind is right you can sail away  .And find tranquility  ..Oh the canvas can do miracles  .Just you wait and see believe me  ..It's not far to never never land  .No reason to pretend  .And if the wind is right you can find the joy  .Of innocence again  ..Oh the canvas can do miracles  .Just you wait and see believe me
I've been on SD since the beginning. Although my presence has wavered over the last few months I still read everyday and do what I can...This place transformed me. It helped me feel okay with how I was living my life...Seeing this place grow has been mind blowing :)
SD gave me something that wasn't drinking to be compulsive about from about days 35-90something. Now it's a resource in adding depth and texture to my stepwork and continuing sobriety....Some songs never stray too far before they come on back home:...[Modest Mouse - Baby Blue Sedan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JAzZYxHvEg)
SD has been here to remind me of what it was like when I was drinking. The constant state of disarray and wondering if things would ever change. It reminds me of what it was like new in sobriety the struggle of dealing with emotion and occurrences sober and facing them head on with the help of others. It reminds me that other people have as much time as me that other young people are in recovery and that people stay sober (CC and SM2L lookin at you!) and that life is good sober. It gives me a chance as a young person to share my story with other young people who are afraid or unsure or just looking for reassurance. ..The song that's been in my head all of today is [You'll never walk alone by Gerry and the Pacemakers](http://youtu.be/OV5_LQArLa0). Maybe it's the World Cup that's got me going into it (the song is Liverpool's anthem essentially) or maybe it's the meaning behind it. I feel as though I walk through life with someone beside me. I NEVER WALK ALONE. 
Weeeeee!!!! Watch those numbers climb and see the internet affect our world around us. I like that thought. I know I certainly bring what I find on SD out into my life. I go to AA meetings and I have shared this site with many people (even have it printed on my welcome card for newcomers at meetings). I tell them it's not an AA "affiliated" site but they can find many useful tools here along with a great bunch of supportive people. I don't know if any have actually taken me up on it but one of my friends who is not in the program has and she's sober today! ..[Washing of the Water](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PXn1dPQsji4) by Peter Gabriel has been with me for days it seems. Probably because I've been doing a lot if posting on my flickr account and part of the lyrics ("living river") is in the URL extension to my home page. ..Thank you to everyone who contributes and lurks here. We have the ability through this site to touch the whole world my friends!
I've only been around for a year but it seems like the numbers are jumping up another 1000 every couple of months.  ..SD has given me a positive purpose for that time that I formerly spent ranting about justice issues with all the impact of pissing in the wind.  And while it sometimes feels similarly I am amazed at the people that reach out and hang on and grow up on this Subreddit.  SD doesn't replace recovery for me but it has given me an accessible outlet for the impulse to do 12-Step work and as a result it has helped me to stay sober and grow in my sobriety.  ..The other thing is in all sincerity I feel that the DINOs and quite a few of the SD regulars have become my friends.  As a result I think of so many of you day to day knowing nothing more than your usernames and what you may have shared on SD or DiR or in PMs with me.  Here's to the next 17000 SD subscribers may they all become DINOs.
Q1: I wouldn't be sober without SD I'm sure of that. So SD has helped me find a new path a better one. I'm thankful for all of the people here who help each other every day to be better versions of themselves. ..Q2: Thanks to reading all the comments before replying I now having a Sailing earworm. I'll have to post a song later... I'm sure eventually something else will bob to the surface.
SD helped confirm what I already knew: I was in serious trouble but that I'm not alone. When I first came here I was hungover depressed and scared. I genuinely thought I was on an inescapable downward spiral! But SD has helped me nip it in the bud. it's great being part of this community and knowing that if i ever need help you guys will gladly oblige and tell me what's what. ..If it wasn't for this subreddit I'd still be searching for that holy grail the fine line between moderation and binge drinking. Reading our older member's posts helped me see that there is no such thing. You all helped me to give it up and realise the many benefits of sobriety!..The song in my mind is the mighty Disclosure's [When A Fire Starts to Burn](http://youtu.be/4nsKDJlpUbA). It's about change ;)

I came to SD 2 years ago fresh out of Detox.  I was hitting some meetings but I didn't stay long.  I went back out for the better part of a year.  But towards the end of that run lurking here gave me hope.  I made it back to the meetings...Now I come here for three reasons.....1. I get to see my own crazy style thinking laid out in black and white text by another alcoholic often a newcomer but not always. I get to see how crazy or flawed my thought process is really clearly when it is on the screen in another person's post.  It's not always so obviously crazy when that type of thinking is going on in my own head.  It's humbling...2. I get to share my experience strength and hope like I would at a meeting but I can share with people that may not have the benefit of a meeting yet...3. I've only just begun to learn to grow to recover.  I come here for the experience strength and hope of all of you.  I come here teachable to learn...I love you guys and I appreciate that your words of wisdom or cries for help are here to challenge me and teach me or give me a chance to serve.  ~~Sometimes~~ Usually it's both in one post...______________________________________.[Brian Fallon - The Blues Mary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWf0GeaKOVA)..I learned how to hammer in the burning August sun..I learned how to lie and cheat how to steal and just how to run..I fell asleep most nights with somebody else's blood on my tongue ..Your tongue..You learned just how to run....But it's just the blues Mary the blues ..Swirling around my head like your dreams in Dorothy's shoes..I'm somewhere over the rainbow for you...You learned how to cry in them lonesome September nights..I learned to get by with the dogs and the dirt and the charm of the street..I fell asleep most nights with your pictures right behind my eyes..Your eyes..The killer and the victim arrive right at the same time..But it's just the blues Mary the blues ..Swirling around my head like your dreams in Dorothy's shoes..I'm somewhere over the rainbow for you..And it's just the blues Mary the blues..Swirling around my head like your dreams in Dorothy's shoes..I'm somewhere over the rainbow for you...The cause for smile is bright like the ramparts on the 4th of July..And my baby swings like a boxer and sends her right hooks onto my chin..She cries like a baby (cries like a baby)..And she wears me just like a ring..Cries like a baby (cries like a baby)..And she wears me just like a ring..Learned how to swagger..I Learned how to hold you while your body burned..I Learned how compromise while this whirlwind hurricane turned..We fell asleep most nights with each other's blood on our tongues..My love..Did you ever just have enough...But it's just the blues Mary the blues ..Swirling around my head like your dreams in Dorothy's shoes..I'm somewhere over the rainbow for you..And it's just the blues Mary the blues..Swirling around my head like your dreams in Dorothy's shoes..I'm somewhere over the rainbow for you..And it's just the blues Mary the blues..Swirling around my head like your dreams in Dorothy's shoes..I'm somewhere over the rainbow for you
It is a comfort to know that I am not alone in my struggles with alcohol and desire to quit drinking.  I know I need to get my butt to a real "live" support group but in the meantime the people on SD keep me sane.  Thinking of The Cave Mumford &amp; Sons.  Don't know exactly what it all means but I imagine my God and the beautiful people on SD pulling me out of my cave and helping me to live my life as it's meant to be.  .  ."The Cave"..It's empty in the valley of your heart.The sun it rises slowly as you walk.Away from all the fears.And all the faults you've left behind..The harvest left no food for you to eat.You cannibal you meat-eater you see.But I have seen the same.I know the shame in your defeat..But I will hold on hope.And I won't let you choke.On the noose around your neck..And I'll find strength in pain.And I will change my ways.I'll know my name as it's called again.. Cause I have other things to fill my time.You take what is yours and I'll take mine.Now let me at the truth.Which will refresh my broken mind..So tie me to a post and block my ears.I can see widows and orphans through my tears.I know my call despite my faults.And despite my growing fears..But I will hold on hope.And I won't let you choke.On the noose around your neck..And I'll find strength in pain.And I will change my ways.I'll know my name as it's called again..So come out of your cave walking on your hands.And see the world hanging upside down.You can understand dependence.When you know the maker's land..So make your siren's call.And sing all you want.I will not hear what you have to say.. Cause I need freedom now.And I need to know how.To live my life as it's meant to be..And I will hold on hope.And I won't let you choke.On the noose around your neck..And I'll find strength in pain.And I will change my ways.I'll know my name as it's called again.
When I think about what my life would look like had I never stumbled upon this subreddit it makes me feel nauseous. This subreddit made me realize that alcoholism is something that can strike in your 20's. I'd have never believed that were it not for this place.  This subreddit performs miracles on a regular basis and I'm thankful every single day that it's always here. ..
What I like most about SD is the stories prove that the issue is indiscriminate. Anyone of any age sex creed etc. can be effected and can stop drinking with the right support. ..If that doesn't provide hope to someone then I'm not sure what does. 
I'm new here but this sub is helping me more than words can say. I'm almost 9 days sober because of you guys! Well and me of course :)..The song knocking around in my head that's been invaluable to me the last couple days is The Who's Blue Red and Grey. It's so uplifting and pretty and the lyrics have kind of been a mantra for mindfulness and appreciating every moment since quitting...Here's the link:.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7SliN-82P0

SD is so great. I don't even know where to start. Started lurking. Wrote my first post. And then holy shit I realized two things. 1) I could stop drinking ( or sad if you will 2) and that if I did thinks in my life would get better one day at a time. Also encouragement and motivation to go to meetings and to exercise. Seeing the numbers on my badge go up fills me with such pride. Seeing other people post their milestones also fills me with pride...One big thing is that it has helped me come to terms with all the awful destructive embarrassing harmful things I did while drinking. Helps me take what I can from my experience and move on...not closing the door/ forgetting my past but the sense of solidarity helps me move forward. I've done shit that would horrify a non alcoholic. I ad knowledge it I no longer 'stuff' those feelings down or try and hide from my past or pretend my past didn't happen so that level of acceptance of the things I've done has been huge in my sobriety. ..Thanks everyone!
SD has been my go to place more so than meetings a lot of the times to find similar stories offer encouragement and learn.  I feel even if I am just lurking it is very cleansing for me especially if I have a bad day.  SD is a place that has helped me so much with what a welcoming understanding and helpful community we have here. ..[Gergory Alan Isakov - All Shades of Blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufHlEvB11dk).."Broken bottles shine just like stars make a wish anyway."
SD has given me somewhere to get insight and wisdom from other people at various stages of sobriety. Through the sub I've gained a new perspective on my relationship with alcohol and both the challenges and rewards that are likely to come through sobriety. It really helps to have a group of like minded people who can help me with any struggles along the way. One thing that I have really taken to heart recently is that I'm not alone in anything that I have struggling with - there are people out there who have felt the same pain and can help me through any stage of this...Highly coincidental but the song I had in my head is Sober by Pink. For a long time I couldn't listen to that song - seemed like the world was goading me whenever it came up on my ipod. And that was happening well before I ever figured I had a problem with alcohol (maybe my subconscious was trying to get that idea through for a while longer than I realised?). Listened to it again this morning and saw it as less of a slap in the face and much more of a reminder as to why maintaining my sobriety is such a good thing. ..How do I feel this good sober? I'm working on it and really the buzz was never worth the fall. I've already had proof that trying to hide my problems behind alcohol wasn't working. The problems and hurt never went away and while I was pretending they didn't exist they were just getting stronger and stronger. ..So now I just have to build up the rest of my life. And then I'll end up feeling *better* sober than I ever did while drinking.
I am new here and already gotten some excellent advice from you guys and girls.  It's just nice to know that I'm not alone.  Life is good and a gift we can't waste...Listening to Everything In Its Right Place - Radiohead http://youtu.be/onRk0sjSgFU
Aimee Mann's album *The Forgotten Arm* has been stuck in my head all day. It's an album about alcoholism. And SD has been a great non-judgmental support group that is available whenever I need it!
SD had given me an internet support system in addition to my AA network which is awesome and also being subscribed keeps me on my toes while I mindlessly scroll reddit I'll be all "Oh right alcoholism can't forget about that"..Also don't forget me -red hot chili peppers (pretty much the whole by the way album)
This place is my daily reminder that I'm not going to drink today.  I love this community the honesty the compassion the support.  While I have a lot of support in friends and family they are never going to quite "get it" the way everyone here does.  ..Today I'm listening to KONGOS -Come With Me Now. 
Have not checked in here in quite a while and wow has this place exploded. . . it's on the exponential up and up.   Great to see so many subscribers who probably care (at least a little bit) about sobriety.   ..SD hasn't really impacted my life in a big way.  This is not to say I don't appreciate it but as far as monumental changes go not so much.  ;)  My program didn't take off until I started getting serious about getting out from my introvert cave and working with newcomers.  My work hours (which are coincidentally spent on the computer) are WAY more productive when I hit a meeting or two and talk to another alkie f2f.  ..Getting wasted and crying into my laptop... wow am I glad I don't have to do that any more.   My laptop still gets some tears once in a while sometimes laughing till I cry -- and sometimes a little sad because ZOMG I AM HUMAN NOT ROBOT HAVE FEELINGS IS OK ... but they're definitely not the miserable kind of tears.  
It's a good time to be alive.  A mere 100 years ago there wasn't much hope for addicts a d alcoholics...SD is like a meeting I take what I need and leave the rest. It also helps me get out of my own self.
Another amazing milestone! I've bounced around online since the BBS days and I've never found a better sobriety site than SD. SD has given me the chance to talk sobriety with people all over the world. It's also given me many new and valued perspectives and insights...In lieu of a song how about a [sound tone](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alfemRp5VE8)--one at 17000 hz! It's already past the point at which I can hear. Can you hear it??
First question: SD has been instrumental to my success this go around with sobriety. Without you guys and all of your stories I'm not sure I would have taken my problem so seriously. Big thanks. ..Second question: I have a four year old daughter so naturally the song in my head is "Let it Go" from Frozen. :)
Q1: It's a great resource for those times when I can't get to a meeting! .As Bill w. said I help myself by helping others...Q2: [Better](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S20wPeZvlTQ) by Cat and the Menagerie.
This subreddit has given me a pool of people with similar experiences to draw on when I've been struggling and haven't had other people to turn to. It has meant a lot to me in my attempt to deal with a really serious problem and has given me comfort in some pretty difficult times...The song knocking around in my head at the moment is inexplicably cheesy 90's hip hop - I listened to the Pharcyde on Rdio at work on Friday and haven't been able to get rid of it. Next stop [/r/nomorepharcydepleasegodstop](/r/nomorepharcydepleasegodstop).
Hasn't yet...[Tho we're friends forever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVtyOwcQo-w)
Funkagenda - One Day at a Time. Trance-y song that starts off with an audio sample from an AA speaker. Only lasts 15-20 seconds but then it sets up an "instrumental" (quotation marks because all production is done in computer and not through any traditional instruments) that for me is contemplative and introspective. ..SD means the world to me. I'm on here all day as I work at a help desk. While I'm waiting for software to install or what not I read a lot of the posts here. Helps me stay focused on my goal of not drinking one day at a time...
**Q1**: I'm very introverted by nature - SD has helped me reach out and keep a support group active in my life...**Q2**: What song? [Atlus Novus by Scale The Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0kUpcCSzn8&amp;feature=kp)..Edit: This thread made me go through and cleanup one of my music libraries at work. Some other gems that I enjoy with their respective genre:..[Grafix - Show Me How - DnB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQbs4zgkNCg)..[Andy Blueman - Time To Rest - Epic Trance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf65BcRCBMU)..[Animals As Leaders - C.A.F.O. - Math Metal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfzWpp0hMc)..[Protest The Hero - Clarity - Progressive Metal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7pvvAuj7jw)..[Paul Gilbert - Get Out Of My Yard - 80s Metal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vS6syL0-jM)..[Diecast - Fade Away - Hardcore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDWlJL5dTxA)..If I think of any others I will add them - As you can see I like mostly metal... .
How'd it change my life:..It helped me quit smoking. The /stopsmoking sidebar while I gave positive feedback here just ate at me until I gave it a shot. I have 90 days today :)..What Song:..The song I wrote recorded and am mixing for my band because I've had to listen to it about 250 times this past week. AAAUGH
*I would not be sober without this subreddit.*..In combination with cognitive behavioural therapy involvement with AOD service providers meditation and my early adventures in AA r/sd provides a valuable service to those wishing to remain sober indefinitely. If I start thinkin' about drinkin' all I need to do is whip out my phone and flick through my Reddit reader to remind myself that I am on a lifelong journey. In mother Australia we have a charity event called Dry July. I did it for three years and only made it through all the way once. The guilt was incredible. SD has helped me adjust my priorities and outlook to see that merely abstaining for a month every year is not enough for me. I have been gifted with the disorder of alcoholism which I am neutralising with my own free will. All that I need to do to be the best I can is not drink which I do one day at a time. Dry July is not enough... I'm doing Dry 'Til Ya Die...Thank you everybody...EDIT: The song would be Tool's 'Lateralus.' I was also singing Mr Bungle's 'Sweet Charity' for most of the afternoon.
Been kicking about here for a few days here and there. I think I first latched on to this subreddit about in the fall of 2011. It took a couple of tries but with the help of this sub AA and a bit of good fortune I've been sober since I woke up and I took my last drink 448 days ago.  ..Want a chuckle? Last night I had a drinking dream and my first thought when I woke up was "Aw fuck. Now I have to reset my badge."  ..Anyway here's one of the most motivating songs I know and it constantly gets stuck in my head for which I am very grateful. PLEASE give it a listen.  ..https://soundcloud.com/alyshabrilla/lifted-master-alysha-brilla  ..Lifted by Alysha Brilla:..You were down in the dark down on your knees  .This was the lowest you'll ever be  .Face on the floor hands at your back  .You were helpless and hopeless and ready to crack.  .You feel all alone and empty and cold  .and you feel like you're done when you're not even old.  .Put on the music you used to love  .cuz you gotta get up you gotta get up   ..You gotta get lifted  .You gotta get lifted  .You gotta turn your world around  .You gotta pick yourself up and off the ground  .Get lifted  .You got to lift it  .You've gotta love what you do and do what you love  .and you gotta get up you gotta get up you gotta get..   ..Somebody who feels just like you  .is lying alone and crying for truth  .and wondering who has been in their shoes  .People walk miles singing the blues.  .and yes you're gonna feel pain  .but music takes that away  .so just put on the records you used to love  .cuz you gotta get up you gotta get   ..You gotta get lifted  .You gotta get lifted  .You gotta turn your world around  .You gotta pick yourself up and off the ground  .Get lifted  .You got to lift it  .You've gotta love what you do and do what you love  .and you gotta get up you gotta get up you gotta get..  ...Pain it's a shame but we all feel the same  .all you gotta know is you gotta live for today  .listen to that rhythm to that sweet melody  .And never look behind you'll see  .and yes you're gonna feel pain  .but music takes that away  .so just put on the records you used to love  .You know you gotta get on up...    ..You gotta get lifted  .You gotta get lifted  .You gotta turn your world around  .You gotta pick yourself up and off the ground  .Get lifted  .You got to lift it  .You've gotta love what you do and do what you love  .and you gotta get up you gotta get up you gotta get..

I love this place. It is amazing. It is the definition of community...SD is not only my sobriety life line--it is one of the sites of inquiry for my MA thesis. The others being physical AA and SMART recovery meetings. I'm thrilled to hear that SD works both ways... That sharing SD with your physical AA community has helped them in some way just as SD suggests checking out physical groups...In my research and experience I've found that community and thriving interpersonal relationships are paramount in recovery. Addiction isolates people from their communities and from themselves. The best remedy is a non-hierarchical togetherness. SD exemplifies this sort of community: one I'm proud to be a part of...Alkaline Trio- Take Lots with Alcohol..And the new Lana Del Rey album is HAUNTING in the best way :)
Thank you everybody.
Like others I'm not sure where I'd be right now without this sub. Two years ago I was in counseling yet failing to get traction for more than a few days at a time. Then I got blackout drunk cut my head got in a terrific dispute with my wife and then left on a trip with my son for three weeks. During which I drank but managed to keep the wheels on and had a great time. ..I returned to a broken marriage and found this sub. I'm not sure how; I'd not been on reddit long before I found it. SD helped me get traction along with everything else I'd been doing. I got two months nondrinking then relapsed and then finally stopped. ..I still have stuff to deal with and stopping drinking and becoming a sober person didn't solve my problems. But I turned the ship around. There are still icebergs around but at least I can see them and steer with some intention. Now I can work on life's problems and have found happiness in that. ..This community has done that for me. Lurking then posting and contributing. It's my daily dose. As days have accumulated I feel close to those who are starting out--and maybe experiencing setbacks--on this journey. I'm not religious but this is the closest experience I've had to salvation. ..Thanks to this community to new posters to all the Day 1 folks to the old-timers who attend here and particularly thanks to the mods for nurturing this place. ..EDIT: Song is Camper Van Beethoven [Take the Skinheads Bowling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKfMlQ7KWFE)
It's given me.. sustained release
SD has given me the chance to read successes and struggles of others from home over the past two years as Ive tried to get sober. It's a constant reminder that people out there have done it and although I have failed over and over and over I can do it too.

A month and a half ago this community helped inspire me to pour out the beer I had just bought instead of crack it open and throw away my sobriety. I desperately wanted to drink nearly every day of my second month. But reading posts here helped me get through it. Haven't had a desire to drink for the last 30 days or so!..As for a song I've got [Keys to the Kingdom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6Ox7zXPsTg) stuck in my head! Rock on r/stopdrinking!
At one time I was a drunk Dalek. Then I became a sober Gallifreyan...17000 eh? I remember when this place had 170!..Oof. I miss y'all. This place has given me a lot. Wisdom patience and the knowledge that life is decent sober...The song that's kicking around my melon? Stern des S dens.
I found SD around 2 months ago after my husband and parents sat me down and told me *what I'm really like* when I drink. I was resistant to believing that I had a problem but was so glad to find this community for support. Coming here and getting the courage to attend that first AA meeting changed my life. I don't attend AA as regularly now but come here to read every day and post when it seems helpful or relevant. Thank you to everyone who makes this community as active and special as it is. You are all incredible and to anyone out there who feels hopeless you aren't--and this moment can be when everything changes. It's a huge leap of faith to put down the bottle live and be present with your thoughts and feelings--but it is worth it. Every bit worth it...And "Sure Shot" by the Beastie Boys is stuck in my head right now along with the Killers "Prizefighter."
It amazes me that I'm coming up on 3 months and it never would have even started without SD. This place was my rock until I began going to meetings and it encouraged me to go. I rarely post here but I lurked for days and kept seeing people saying things I could relate to. Whenever I had a question stuck in my head that I was too anxious to post about I searched for it and without fail someone else had already asked it. I found exactly what I needed here. I love /r/stopdrinking and am extremely thankful that it exists...And I have Strawberries by Why? stuck in my head.
[Almost Lover - Jasmine Thompson \(A Fine Frenzy cover\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6o1GVKul38c) ..Ahhhh this song!!! Been on repeat for dayz man. ..Yo thanks SD. I'm sober because of yous.
Just the incredible feeling of freedom. I feel like a weight of chains has been cast off. It's one more thing to leave behind. Thanks SD!!!
SD has been [so good to me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVcG9lpZV24).
