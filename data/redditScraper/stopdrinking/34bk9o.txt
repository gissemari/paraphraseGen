So I think I'm going to need all the support I can get on this one. I'm currently enlisted in the Air Force (22) and we have a dependency program called ADAPT. I drink a little bit excessively (6 times a week 4 drink minimum). I didn't really want to quit drinking I just wanted tips on moderation so I went to go speak with them. They gave me an audit and I end up getting diagnosed with moderate alcohol dependency. I'm now enrolled in a 20 day therapy session at a behavioral hospital where at the end of that period we will reassess where I'm at. I'll be getting random blood and urine samples drawn to make sure I'm not ingesting any alcohol during this time frame. ..I didn't want any of this I absolutely love drinking. I can't drink at all anymore without risking disciplinary repercussions. All of my friends drink so now I'm going to be lonely as fuck. I have a lot of hobbies that I regularly did such as playing the banjo cycling kiteboarding kayaking ect. I will continue to do these activities however I'm going to be left with nothing to do during the night time and I'll be all by myself. I hate the fact that I even went into get advice in the first place because look where I'm at now. ..I will be trying my hardest to actually pull this off but it's going to suck and I'm not all that thrilled. I'm also extremely nervous that I will "relapse" and get into trouble. Any advice or tips on how to deal with this and where to make friends that don't drink would be much appreciated. I'm not religious at all so church isn't something I'll be interested in.

Send me a PM if you want man. It's my first day as well. 
Is it possible that this assessment is correct and I don't know this is actually a great thing that may save you from a miserable life?
