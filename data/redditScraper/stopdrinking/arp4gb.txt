Little bit of a past success my mom just texted and reminded me about. Today is my 2nd birthday and I'm 6. In February 2013 I was struggling hard with self esteem and severe depression and had some internet bullying going on. i didn't have an alcohol problem yet. I decided it wasn't time for me to be here anymore.   I won't say much for trigger purposes but I woke up 2 days later in ICU. When I realized where I was I just felt so guilty. I cried. I didn't know what to think. But I knew I definitely didn't want to die. I was basically forced to go to short term inpatient treatment so my phone was taken away.   Someone I had been talking to called 911 and she didn't know my address. On record my residence was my parents because I just moved into my own apartment. So the police went there first. In a panic my mom and sister spam called me and left voicemails. I remember getting my phone back and my mom dropping me off at home. I listened to the voicemails and crumbled. I felt their pain and fear in their voices and it broke my heart.   I immediately attempted to contact my ex who lived in Alaska had PTSD and had struggled with ideations. Same day I found his obituary information. I was devastated. I couldn't save him from the same mistake I made.  I don't judge people who have these issues or attempt and I'm not angry at those who pass on. We never know what someone else's pain is or feels like. What might be easy for me is someone else's hell. All that to say there is a ton of help out there. Don't ever feel like you have no one. If you can't shake loneliness just remind yourself you feel alone and that is a symptom of your mental health and not the reality. It is harder with images and memories and thoughts that pop up in our head and sometimes we can't explain where it's coming from. But hold on and fight it even if it's all you can do. Don't those dark shadows in your mind win. You're worth giving yourself a chance to make it out.

Thank you for sharing. Your story is no joke and was probably not easy to share.  It is helpful though. I want you to know that by you opening up you helped me.
