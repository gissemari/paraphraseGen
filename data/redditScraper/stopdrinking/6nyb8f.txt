Hello all. Today is my second day of not drinking. It's going pretty well and I hope it stays that way. A friend told me to drink la croix in place of alcohol. I googled it and came across this group. ..I've been a 6-8 beer per weeknight and 8-12 on weekends for years... 6 months ago I landed my dream job. I left a stable job I had been at for years (and could roll in late with a hangover and nobody cared) to take a much higher paying job. I thought my life was made. There'd be no more struggling and busting my ass to make ends meet. I ended up being fired 3 months later just from my inability to focus making simple mistakes etc. I know it was because of my drinking. ..I was unemployed for a month and became very depressed about my lost dream. Beat myself up about my drinking but all I did was drink more day and night. ..I got another job 2 months ago and I cut back on my drinking.. for a few weeks. I didn't want the same thing to happen again and I convinced myself that I could regulate my drinking. But that didn't last. So I've realized that I need to stop drinking completely. ..I've been drinking la croix like my life depends on it but it's really keeping the cravings away. I know it's still early but this is the longest I've been sober in years.
