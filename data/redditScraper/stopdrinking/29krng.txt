I may or may not have mentioned in some of my previous posts but when I was in the Behavioral Health Unit at a hospital in 2012 (drunk wanting to kill myself) a psychiatrist diagnosed me with Cluster B personality traits...For reference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_B_personality_disorders..I won't go into an in depth description of Cluster B and my symptoms but I'm the classic "Ego maniac with an inferiority complex."  I get my feelings hurt incredibly easily I need constant external validation etc.  I used to drink to "check out" from these feelings.  If I didn't like how someone treated me I drank.  If I got rejected by some girl at the bar I drank and so on...Now that I haven't had a drink in over 10 months I'm forced to face these feelings without my previous coping mechanism.  I've developed other tools but progress is slow.  ..Anyway I don't feel like drinking but I'm incredibly tired and unmotivated and just needing to connect with others that have similar struggles as me.  I hope you are all doing well today.  I appreciate the time you take to read this and the posts you make help me tremendously...Thanks :)

You too?!!!  
Yeah man it really sucks having to find other coping mechanisms for all the crazy junk I used to drink to suppress. I think it's like one of those things where you're overrun with mongooses so you let loose a whole bunch of snakes to get them and then are like "ah damn look at all these snakes."
When you're feeling shitty that's the best time to check in!..Hang in there -- relearning coping skills is tough but it's ultimately a lot better to deal with them sober than not...
