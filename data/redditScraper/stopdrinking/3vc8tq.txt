The Op Ivy song referenced in the title of this post has been in my head since my meeting earlier... .It's so hard seeing people relapse. I guess it gets easier but over the past couple of weeks it's been rife amongst some of my home group. Tonight was a serious reminder of what is waiting for me the second I drink again - a guy literally begging for help after his most recent relapse binge. His health and mental health is in tatters. He looks exhausted and downtrodden. My heart breaks for him as he's the loveliest guy but just can't get sober for any real length of time. It could easily be me but luckily today I've spoken to other alcoholics read some recovery stuff and been to a meeting.

Hell yeah I love Operation Ivy! I'll always look at that song differently now.
