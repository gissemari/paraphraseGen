Last night hubby had his MRI done next Friday we meet with his new oncologist/surgeon to figure out the next step...probably surgery in early November.  ..This week I started working with a new sponsor since my "old" one moved out of state.  (Old sponsor and I are still in contact but I feel I need face to face contact occasionally to keep me on track.)..This morning I met with a group of young women at my house for a monthly "Dino" (people with more than 1 year sober) AA Book Study I've started.  We are working through the book and discussing how we would go through this information with newcomers and relate the info to our own experiences to help sponsees.  ..So I'm making a point to kick up my sobriety efforts as the next few weeks come up.  As I said spouse will likely be having surgery (if that is the direction we go with treatment plan) in early November.  So once again he will have a holiday season battling cancer but if that is what it takes to have more Christmases together we'll do it.  ..Speaking of Christmas I've undertaken a project "Hope Tree" working with friends to create cancer ribbon ornaments of all colors to decorate the artificial tree on the cancer floor of our hospital.  Hundreds of ribbons will be made and **lots** of ribbon and supplies have been purchased (I probably should not have done all of that on my own but it is done now).  ..If this will give some joy to struggling patients and their families in the holiday season it is worth it.  Each patient will be able to write their name or a message a blessing or a wish on a tag attached to the ornament.  I have one month to get this project done..but it is charity work that gets me outside of myself.  ..This is a mock-up of what we'll be making.  http://imgur.com/Oe8DkSH..Here is your challenge Sobernauts:  Bring a little cheer to someone today.  You have blessings in your life...and November is NOT the only time to be thankful.  So buy a cup of coffee for the guy in the line behind you.  Smile at the woman dealing with her toddler or offer to help someone carry their groceries.  You have no idea what is going on in those person's lives...and while you may be struggling with your desire to drink by spending a few minutes brightening the day and improving the life of another human being you make yourself a better person.  It is worth it.  ..Stay sober my friends...Mouse

**AMEN!**
Beautiful work here my Mouse.
Your posts are always appreciated!
Great post! I wish you and spouse the best. I love your idea for the Dino big book study group. Also love the orange ribbon you posted for obvious reasons :)
Thank you for this. Sometimes we need a reminder of the fragility of life. Doing something you may see as a small act of kindness can turn out to have a great impact on someone else. You are doing a great thing here Mouse. Thank you for the inspiration. Sending my love to you and your husband.
Mouse you are always such an inspiration. I will keep you and your hubby in my prayers.
Your Dino big book study sounds really great! I am very frightened about the prospect of sponsoring. I didn't find much use for the big book personally but I feel I should connect with it more for the sake of my future sponsees. I wonder if there is anything like that in my city? And if not maybe I could start one? Hmmm... There are big book studies but I like the idea of looking at it from the perspective of showing it to newcomers.
The "hope tree" is a wonderful idea. I'll be paying the kindness forward. I'm crying your amazing.
Yes! Thank you for this "big" reminder!

Prayers for you both.
Update appreciated Mouse.  I was actually wondering how you and Hubby were doing the other day. Thoughts &amp; Prayers from the Batcave for both of you..Love the Pay It Forward idea!
I will do better today for having read this! Hang in there and thanks for sharing.
