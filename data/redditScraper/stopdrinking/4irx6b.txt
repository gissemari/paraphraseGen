This is day two. I am really struggling to not pour a glass of wine. Yesterday was fine!  And I'm giving myself 50 different ways to rationalize it!  Like oh maybe I can just drink a glass or two?!  Or maybe I overreacted. Ugh.

In the first few weeks I found it very helpful to search this forum for things like "blackout" or "prison" or "manslaughter" - for me "blackout" and "family" were very good reminders of the price I would pay for a glass of wine or anything else alcoholic.  "Newborn" was on the list too as I had recently become a dad again.  It really does surprise me how sick my thinking was.  I would like to offer my encouragement that it does get easier.  It feels so good to NOT feel so bad all the time!  Hang in there :)
It took me a few weeks before I got used to the new normal. I promise you it does get easier. After the first few weekends I got used to what it is again to function without a constant buzz or worse. I know when i first started quitting I was doing a little bit of white knuckle coffee and Netflix binging. Then I felt boredom set in after a month. Then I had to find things that I like to do especially the things I could not so because I was drunk. The feeling to be able to go or do what I want at anytime because I was sober was quite freeing. I also stopped by this sub often and read and posted daily. Good Luck and glad you are here.
You have to learn how to do everything sober and after the initial wave of suddenly sober euphoria the work begins.  Look at it as a new challenge to learn and overcome your triggers.  You will feel great along the way but there are plenty of speedbumps so slow down and drive over them.
