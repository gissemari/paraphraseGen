Not really sure what is going on with me. ..It all started on Saturday when I was talking with my wife about my sobriety. This has been a hang up for me in the past. She has been more supportive this time around but our conversation on Saturday led me to believe that she still doesnt understand that drinking in any form is completely off the table for me. She's a normie she doesn't get it and I don't fault her for it- but damn its just introduced all of these weird thoughts and feelings for me. ..I have been feeling great. Not drinking has been really good to me and really good to my family. I asked her if she has noticed a change in me at all- and she said- not really. I guess this hurts because I feel like I have made so much progress- I've been working so hard to be good but one of the people closest to me has not really noticed that much of a change...I have always been a hard worker I am not the kind of person who lets things go unfinished or lets things slide to an unacceptable degree. Even when I was drinking I managed to get my masters degree and graduate with a 3.9 GPA I managed to get promoted at my old job and then I secured the job I had been working toward for several years. Our family life was pretty good. My kids are happy and active in sports and activities. I have also been supporting our family for the last 7 months on my income alone (about 3.5 of those months while in full blown addiction). So to anyone outside of my head full blown addiction did not really look so terrible. ..But on the inside it hurt so goddamn much. Alcohol felt like the only thing I had- even though I was surrounded by so much that I had worked so hard for- but all those things were starting to feel like they were just getting in the way of my drinking. ..When things weren't up to my standards I felt like it was due to my drinking- but coped by drinking more. I am a perfectionist. I always have been and I put a lot of pressure on myself. Still do. So when I started getting out of shape and putting on weight and my wife and son started getting out of shape and putting on weight I felt like it was my fault. I still do. When my 6 y/o started acting out and I dealt with it lazily or ignored it entirely and her behavior continued because I was unable to be consistent with discipline I felt like her behavior was my fault. I still do. I know I cant fix any of these things when I am drinking and since I quit I know they are improving...As a family we are eating better. I have been working out and that has motivated my son and wife to work out too. I am present and able to consistently discipline my 6y/o and her behavior is getting better. But the fact that my wife cannot see that this improvement is a direct result of my quitting drinking really really makes me mad and frustrated. I want some credit from her for all the hard work I do. Now I feel guilty that I need validation from her so desperately. Its stupid that I would even gamble my sobriety over something like this. It makes no sense...I feel like I can share this here but I dont feel like I can talk about this with her. I honestly feel like she feels threatened by my sobriety. ..Not to like brag or toot my own horn but I am a pretty good looking guy. I am loosing weight and getting back into shape but I am doing that for me. I think my wife sees my self improvement as a vehicle to attract other women. Since I've sobered up shes mentioned that she is afraid that I will leave her. She even told me that she wants to get a job because she is worried that I will leave her and she will have no way to support herself or the kids. Let me just say I do NOT want to leave her at all. I love her and we are good together...Honestly. One of the reasons I quit drinking is because of behavior I exhibited when I was drunk and alone. I never cheated on my wife. But when I was drunk I thought about it- more times than I would like to admit. I would browse casual encounter ads on craigslist and fantasize about it. Things I WOULD NEVER DO WHILE SOBER. I never did pursue anything and never communicated with anyone- but I know that if I continued to drink- it would have happened eventually and that absolutely would have ruined my marriage. ..One of the biggest reasons I quit drinking was for my kids. The other was for my wife and our marriage. I cant tell her that. So I have to live with it...The cognitive dissonance of this all is just driving me nuts. This helped to get it all out there. Thanks for listening.

You struggle mirrors my own quite closely.  I totally get your need to feel validated by your wife.  And not getting that makes you feel alienated.  Same here.  ..All I can in consolation is that it's early days yet for you.  This is very fresh for you AND her.  Our spouses cannot ever TRULY know the hell that was going on in our minds and bodies when were in active addiction.   It's simply not possible no matter how much we articulate it.   I'm quite positive that her seemingly indifferent attitude toward the positive changes you are making are simply making her insecure about herself.  That's normal.  My advice:  try to visibly demonstrate even more than usual how much you are attracted to her physically &amp; want her and how much you love her.  Touch kiss hold - in public even.  Once she feels more confident in her own sexiness she will in turn feel more confident in your loyalty to her which will help her feel more enthusiasm for the MASSIVE internal changes you have been making.  ..Best of luck on your journey.  You got this   . 
Thanks for sharing. I think I have a similar personality as you except I'm not a guy. I don't have too much advice but maybe if your wife is open and if you feel comfortable...you should share what you wrote here to her. You could rewrite it in a letter form. What you say makes total sense and I get it...maybe she will too Except you could leave out the craigslist part etc...because I'd be furious about that and I think it would just degrade trust. Good luck! And please keep on going it sounds like your sober self is so good for your family! IWNDWYT
It does kind of sound to me like she's subconsciously or consciously minimizing you kind of trying to block you out of her vision because she feels threatened somehow. Sort of being in denial of you...It makes sense that that would hurt not being seen. Needing validation--I feel like we are allowed to expect to be perceived accurately by those we trust it's not like you're demanding the postman acknowledge your personal growth. But likely it's just a fear and resistance thing in her because she *does* see the changes and has mentioned her insecurities. ..I wonder if she's depressed or what's going on. I'm sorry.
Thanks for sharing this. ..It's great stuff that you are almost at 100 days and it sounds like you are doing amazing honest work on yourself even if perhaps it's hard for those around you to see clearly yet. ..Perhaps being quite functional even under the drinking is making the internal change harder to see on the outside. ..Patience is a virtue and perhaps your improvement in time will be the spark of improvement in the ones close to you as well. ..I think remembering this is important :..&gt; I know I cant fix any of these things when I am drinking and since I quit I know they are improving. ..
I found that I not only have to let go of past resentments but I need to be honest about what I need so that I don't create new ones...As hard as it may be we need to have these difficult conversations with the people we love. That is part of the growing and evolving that comes with recovery. ..Good luck. The beginning is so tricky but it definitely gets easier along the way.
Yeah my SO is very supportive but he's similar; I was a very high functioning problem drinker and aside from a glowing complexion and a smaller dress size (not by much sadly) he confessed he didn't notice much of a difference. He said that he has to consciously notice it like "oh you're not drinking" because it's just such a normal fabric of our lives (neither one of us drinks). ..It's been a moderate struggle with only a handful of truly rough days and I don't talk about it that much but it is hard when you're doing so well and your partner is like "oh you're not drinking? hadn't really noticed!" 
I know the feeling of having a  normie  for a partner who just doesn't see the problem as I do because I've always been high functioning. This has caused me to fall off the wagon (briefly thank goodness) twice. Both times while on holiday and wanting to  just relax  and  enjoy  with him.  The problem is I don't relax or enjoy drinking at all anymore. It gives me anxiety causes me to be irritable and creates a giant mind fuck everytime. ..Finally this last time he got it - because instead of trying to hide how alcohol makes me feel on the inside - I spilled it all. He now sees how it's best for me to abstain and supports that. If that hadn't worked I would've initiated therapy for us. As a therapist myself I know the power of having a neutral 3rd party assist in helping couples to see both themselves and the other so much more clearly.  I wish you the best. It sounds like you have a really good thing that you don't want to lose.  If her insecurity and your feeling invalidated continue to cause friction it could be worth checking out a good therapist to get past this bump. I've found it usually makes the bond that much stronger to consciously work through difficult tensions. ..Stay strong! You're worth it. 
"My wife cannot see that this improvement is a direct result of me quitting drinking really makes me mad and frustrated."..When I'm "upset" that's a signal for me that *something is wrong with me*.  "Wrong" being along the lines of I'm unsettled I'm not at peace I'm 'out of whack"...So when you write her behavior "really makes me mad" is an opportunity to look at myself...I've learned that if I re-write that in the following form I get more success:  .."My wife has done X-Y_Z and I have **decided** that I will now be mad."..Another way of writing it is "I didn't get what I want and now I have **decided** that I will be mad."..Because that's what I do.  Someone cannot actually MAKE me mad.  I choose to be mad. ..When I arrive at this juncture I can now ask myself "Do I **want** to  be mad?"..Do I want to be irritated increase my pulse be resentful give someone the "silent treatment" plot my next actions because I'm "Justified"?..If so I'm right where I want to be...Usually I decide I DON'T want to be there...
