*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*. .**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**. .I'm pledging myself to not drinking today and invite you to do the same.. .Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.. .It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours lets not drink alcohol!. .---. .**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!. .What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up.. .**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.. .**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.. .---. .This post goes up at:. .    US - Night/Early Morning  .    Europe - Morning  .    Asia and Australia - Evening/Night. .A link to the current Daily Check-In post  can always be found near the top of the sidebar.. .---..A few quotes on Gratitude and Happiness to ponder:..- "*Most people are about as happy as they make up their minds to be.*" --Abraham Lincoln         .- "*Optimism is a happiness magnet. If you stay positive good things and good people will be drawn to you.*" --Mary Lou Retton         .- "*For every minute you are angry you lose sixty seconds of happiness.*" --Ralph Waldo Emerson         .- *The struggle ends when gratitude begins.*" --Neale Donald Walsch         ..And last but not least from the infinite wisdom of our very own u/slipacre...         .- "*Most often the only thing I can change is my attitude.  Changing my attitude fixes a lot of things.*"...I wish each and every one of you a Peaceful Day (or Night) and know that YOU Are Loved.   ..I will not drink today no matter what happens good or bad.
----------immediate responses--------

I survived Day Three! Went to my very first meeting and got my 24 hr coin and met some very nice people. Got a Big Book and started reading it. Met with my new lawyer paid them way too much money and worked out a plan for the DUI charge. ..Will hit a meeting tomorrow if I get called into town to work if not I might just stay home with the Big Book and some seltzer water...IWNDWYT!
 IWNDWYT 
Thanks shineon &amp; excellent day to be with sober friends. At 1pm CT today I will have been sober for 1 YEAR! It is truly a day to celebrate! Brian Tracy said..."Every great move forward in your life begins with a leap of faith a step into the unknown." I am grateful today to have miraculously found the courage to take that leap. Stay strong &amp; Sober on! I will NOT drink with you today! Peace
On day 3 of my sobriety. Feeling good that I'm choosing to live a healthy lifestyle.
Hey SD - I'm not drinking today...Wishing you a lovely day filled with happiness and good health &lt;3.
I remember when I first started visiting here I was surprised by all the support gratitude positivity and optimism. I am finally starting to understand- conquer addiction (for 6 hours 6 days or 6 years) and you start to feel like you are back in the drivers seat and you get to pick the company and destination. So- today I'm driving to the beach you can all have a ride there are plenty of snacks and fizzy waters in the cooler. IWNDWYallT.
Thank you for hosting shineonme4ever! IWNDWYT
I didn't drink in Aus with you today and I won't tonight!

No drinking today 
IWNDWYT
I am not drinking today..I've never done a very good job at focusing just on one day so this go around that's going to be my focus just one day. Just this Tuesday.
I failed. 
I'm in a rehab for physical (not alcoholic lol) ailments this week. I've befriended a man with a lame arm one with a faulty artificial hip one who has a ten minute memory and a plain weirdo. And a cute nurse (every ward has to have one right!). Instead of packing five bottles of booze I packed five family sized bags of chocolate. Step two: Not eat them all on the first night.....I will not drink with you today! 
I've had rather a lot of "Day 1s" recently so here's to Day 3 (raises sparkling mineral water)...IWNDWYT
Day 3. IWNDWYT! 
For today not drinking. 
Changing and adapting my attitude has always been the key for me for things to be better or go smoother. But I still have many moments where I think why the fck do I always have to change my attitude perhaps you should change your attitude and that my friends does not get me to far. I am thankful I don't have to drink today and I won't. Peace People
Made it to day 6. Got to sleep at 1030 and my daughter woke up at 4 am because she's sick. I'm sober so I could easily help my wife out. Never felt better to get so little sleep. My daughter is also feeling much better and snuggling with us.
Started off the day meditating instead of staring at my phone for an hour. ..Have a coffee date soon. Baby steps...IWNDWYT 
Checking in. On day 38 but the badge is still stuck.

I attended another concert while sober last weekend. Felt amazing...I'm keeping the sober train rolling for at least one more day. I will stay free from alcohol today.

I'm at the two week mark. Here's where the going gets tough for me. Won't drink today!
Glorious sober morning soberniks!  Here in Smurflandia this little blue worker likes to start his day with coffee kitty and meditation (so much for alliteration).  A purring cat in your lap really helps clear the mind.  Have a smurferific day! IWNDWYT 
Today marks 1 month for me &amp; IWNDWYT
Working on day 106. I will not drink with you today!

IWNDWYT - Day 4 excited for my day. Last night was great I got some laundry done and the kitchen is clean got some solid sleep with dreams last night too! 
IWNDWYT   
I will not drink today!
Sam Harris has some good quotes to the effect of: with meditation you eventually realize you decide how angry or upset you want to be in any given moment...Anyway watched The Dirt last night. It glorified intoxication and bad behaviour as only a rockstar profile can. It also showed the gross side.  Whatever. ..Not drinking TODAY!
Thanks for the great quotes u/shineonme4ever. ..Today I will make up my mind to be sober and happy starting with a good workout at the gym to get the endorphins going. I hope all of you have a great day too! IWNDWYT
Good morning everybuddy! Let's stay positive today and kick Tuesday's ass! IWNDWYT! 
Good morning from California!  It's 4:30 am and I'm on my second cup of coffee and reading my beloved SD .  I must poke my head in here a dozen times a day see what's happening.  Good people of SD IWNDWYT    Gigi 
I will not drink with you today!
I will not drink with you today!
IWNDWYT
 Changing my attitude fixes a lot of things . Amen. Needed to hear this today morning. I will not drink with you fine folks today. Happy Tuesday SD. Shine your brightest.
The beginning of Day 17 and all is going well. I had energy when I got home from work last night and started cooking dinner right away rather than just plopping on the couch and not wanting to do anything. Happy to come here every morning and see all of the support and well wishes. :) And of course IWNDWYT.
Day 9.  Im flying out of the city to be with my mom for a week in an environment where drinking isnt really an option.  Havent been tempted too much but still looking forward to the added security time for contemplation and figuring out what im up to next in life.  IWNDWYT
Welcome Day 2. I feel so much better today and I'm looking forward to going to bed tired and happy tonight. I will not drink with you today!
I will not drink with you today 
day 9...&amp;#x200B;
IWNDWYT 
Whoops. I had lots of plans for things I wanted to do before work this morning but one thing took priority: sleep! ..In sobriety I am learning to listen to my body and give it what it needs. Today that was a little extra sleep and that's okay. ..I will not drink with you today!
Getting closer to a second spin around the sun. I won't be drinking with you today!

I recently stepped into a new role at work and Tuesdays are mega stressful. But I won't be drinking today!
IWNDWYT 
Instead of drinking I will work on this every day to avoid slips (Sobriety Losing Its Priority).  .Today I'm joining a gardening group definitely can't show up to that drunk.  Then there'll be some further reading of TNM and the BB.  .I'm loving these check-ins they're so positive...IWNDWYT :)
I will not drink today.

IWNDWYT 
Checking in. Not drinking alcohol today.
Made it to day ten. Going for eleven tomorrow. IWNDWYT
23 days sober! It feels great to type that and seems surreal. I counted every day early on and they dragged forever. Then I focused hard on sobriety and the day to day and all of a sudden it's been 23 days!..IWNDWYT 
I will not drink today!..Been feeling the social anxiety and lack of friends a bit more lately. Going to try to get myself out of my shell a little bit in the coming weeks if I can. Hopefully spring helps.
IWNDWYT
Today I will not drink...Today I will go for a walk in the spring sun...Today is my focus...Stay strong SD! &lt;3..&amp;#x200B;
Good morning SD. .I will not be drinking with you today and I will never drink again and I will never change my mind. 
I won't drink today!
I love these quotes! IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT 
I will not drink today.
iwndwyt
Instead of drinking today I'll try to compete some basic tasks to make my life better.
Happy and healthy! I'm not drinking today
I will not drink today!!!
Got into a fight with the SO yesterday. It wasn't fun but I was able to keep a cool head and we could work through it. Something that would have been impossible if I weren't sober...IWNDWYT
I found this amazing community yesterday on my day 1 after a best friend led me here on a tearful wine filled Sunday of despair and sadness. This is not my first day 1 but waking up today (after sweat filled sheets shirts and choppy sleep) I know each day I will gain a little more clarity and a lot more peace.  The physical will only be temporary and im ready to take my life back. This is my first post but I'm pumped to say day 2 I will not drink with you today!!!
Absolutely no way!  
IWNDWYT!
Good morning. I will not drink with you today. 
Lots of ice cream but no alcohol - I Does anyone else get triggered by relief? Or maybe it's the space where anticipation used to be. After I have achieved something that I have been nervous about like a big client meeting my instinct is to desperately grasp for something to ease the strain - to numb after a period of intense concentration. It's odd though because it's usually a response to something I have done well while a poor performance would cause me to dig in my heels and keep working. Anyways needless to say I filled the void with sugar not alcohol so I shall count my blessings. IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT!!      
IWNDWYT
I will not drink today. 
Taking a stab at day one here \_again\_ -- Feeling very up and down minute by minute but I know in my heart this is what I have to do.
Morning SD! IWNDWYT! 
Week One Done!!  And IWNDWYT   
Not today.
I will join you all in not drinking today or tonight. 
Saw a photo of myself from a couple of years ago during a heavy drinking period. My fave was so swollen it was almost twice the size and my eyes were tiny slurs. Funny thing is that I thought I looked ok at the time but the difference has been astonishing especially since trying to get sober I've been paying much more attention to my diet etc. IWNDWYT 
**IWNDWYT!!!** Going out with The Husband tonight in Northern KY to see Kinky Friedman solo no Texas Jewboys! Our adult sons are both going as they grew up around Uncle Kinky so at least they know what to expect! Dinner at Pompillos!
I will not drink with you today.
Hello friends I'm beginning day 2 without alcohol. Just for today I am NOT drinking and IWNDWYT. 
Good morning team! Love you all. Together we are strong no booze all day long!..IWNDWYT!
IWNDWYT 
Day 10 for me today! I have an app that tracks "streaks" for habits I am trying to cultivate and since 2016 the longest I have gone without alcohol is 17 days. Here's hoping that my current streak sticks...I will not drink today.
I am not drinking today.
I'm happy I didn't drink last night. I won't drink tonight either - I will have a good productive day instead. 
I will sooooooooooooooooooooooo not drink with any of you tonight. ;)
Not gonna make a whole new thread since searching yielded pages and pages of results. Today is day 36 and last Friday at age 33 I was diagnosed with ADHD and it makes so much goddamn sense. In the past I've quit smoking for 3 weeks went on a diet and exercise plan for 6 weeks and lost 25 pounds. Both of those times and so many others I got bored and stopped doing the needful...I was so worried that with alcohol after awhile I'd get similarly bored. "Well I know how to quit drinking don't need to worry about that anymore because I could do it again."..I will not drink with you today. Even if sitting with my friend while she awaits testifying against her abuser in court today makes me as angry as it has all right to.
Good morning.   Looks like my badge has been updated to double bad luck so I better not drink today 
Just got out of rehab and IWNDWYT
checking in!
Still sober.
I will not drink with you today 
I will not drink with you today

Iwndwyt   
Starting to feel better. Waking up hangover free is truly a nice feeling!! Peace everyone..I will not drink today! 
I will not drink today. 
I will not drink today. 
Day 91 for me went to meetings on Sunday and Monday. Picked up my 90 day chip yesterday! The 60 day chip was gold-coloured and the 90 day chip is green. IWNDWYT!
I will not drink today. 
I won't drink today!
Getting moved in--I will not drink with you today!
Great quotes /u/shineonme4ever!..Toddler is sick with a barking cough.  I slept in a chair with him on my chest to keep him upright and comfortable last night.  It's not the best circumstances but I love that feeling when he falls asleep and just sinks into my arms.  I'm going to miss these times once he's too big for that kind of snuggle...This moment brought to you by Sobriety  as I prolly would have been blacked out if I was even awake enough to help back when I was drinking...IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT 
Checking in for today. Was dry for 30 days and have been drinking more often than not this month. Trying to sustainably give it up for good but man it's hard with how much drinking is intertwined with most social or celebratory aspects of culture. Also the fact that I haven't found a good replacement way to deal with stress and just instantly relax/ check out makes it difficult for me. Anyways just sharing my struggles and trying to make it through the day sober. 
Still not drinking still missing my flair :( 
Day 10 going strong! IWNDWYT 
Well I f'd up. I let stress and anxiety get the better of me. It triggered my desire to drink to feel a release. Time to start over. I need to remember the great changes I've made. Fix the mistakes and do better today. I will not drink with you today!!
I will not drink today but I will go to class even tho I am mega later &amp; stay after to help a classmate with a project. I love the quotes you shared! I am obsessed with The Secret atm and the power of attraction (positive). ..[High Five](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg)
IWNDWYT    
  IWNDWYT aaand will eat healthy today :)
Checking in. AA meetings have been depressing the shit out of me lately. Maybe I'll skip next weeks for a breather. 
On Day 10 and using my free (not hungover) time to look for new apartments and plan for a big event next year looking forward to a productive and restful day. IWNDWYT! 
IWNDWYT
Day 177 of not drinking. IWNDWYT 
Requested a badge reset for yesterday. I drank a couple times a week throughout March and it sucked and made me feel crappy. I'm done for good this time. 
I will not drink today.
I'm done beating myself up over poor decisions this past weekend...Live learn and move forward...Thanks for the encouraging words! It means a lot...IWNDWYT
iwndwyt!
[Been hanging around in the chat under this name and finally made an account because I've been lurking under my regular name and didn't want to connect them.]..Anyway here I am on day 17. I didn't think I'd make it this far! .Having quite a lot of weird memories... Like 20 times a day a random memory from the last 15 years will pop into my head. Like clearly defined moments some related to drinking some not; some regretful some nostalgic and a few seemingly banal...It's just an observation and I don't know what it means... stuff suppressed or just neurons kicking into action. ..Anyway day 17 it is and I know I won't be drinking today...Over and out!
No drinking here today 
Day 3 today. Feeling kinda anxious but better than I was 3 days ago. IWNDWYT!
Almost 3 weeks in miss the liquor but enjoying having all this time back to myself. Just gotta hang in there. 
Happy Tuesday! It's a beautiful day in Houston..IWNDWYT  
I actually made it through the three day weekend!  I'm on a roll and will not drink today!
I made it to 154 days but I reset this Friday. Really bummed out because I was looking forward to the half-year mark...But trying to stay positive and focusing on how much I smashed my previous record and how good it is going to feel when I break this new one...IWNDWYT
Attitude and optimism absolutely key elements in the journey. Thanks for the reminder Shine. IWNDWYT.

Day 2 of sobriety for me. Trying to stay healthy and productive today. Went for a nice walk/jog with the dog and had a nice breakfast consisting of mostly fruit. I will not drink today
IWNDWYT 
Good morning everyone today will be another sober day for me. Hope everyone has a lovely day.
Oh my gosh! My badge showed up for the first time! What a wonderful motivator to not drink today! 
I will not drink with you today 
Had to re-set back to day 1 on Sunday after having 3 beers on Saturday. IWNDWYT!
I dreamt last night that I got drunkwoke up this morning and my counter is gone all together.Not cool.

"gratitude is a must"
Everyone I went to bed sober last night.... I am so proud of myself.... IWNDWYT
Hi everyone after nose dive into insanity (I drank over the weekend) I'm back and will not be drinking with you today. Its hard to be honest about that even anonymously but its the only way I can overcome this problem...  honest and sober.  Have a great day. 
IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT lovely brave fantastic people!
Love those quotes! Happy Tuesday SD I will be enjoying this beautiful day and not drinking with you all! 
31 days! IWNDWYT
Love all of this.  IWNDYYT.
It's been a full week on here and I have noticed some differences. Sleeping better able to rise and shine earlier and go to bed earlier. Spending less and eating less...&amp;#x200B;..Just for today I will not drink.
iwndwyt unless you got that LaCroix mango. I'll drink all of that. 
IWNDWYT! Day 3  stay strong everybody. 
I will not drink with you today!
I will not drink with you today 
Day one again :/ 
IWNDWYT
First time checking in after a long time lurking IWNDWYT 
I won't drink today 
won't drink today
My last drink was March 21st and for real I have zero euphoria zero sense of pride or accomplishment. All of my failures over the past 30 years are swirling above my head in an ominous vortex. I want to run away from it. I want to leave the world without any further damage from me. I don't want to exist but I am too cowardly to end it.
Not today.
Iwndwyt. Day 2.
I don't post here much but where's my flair?  I passed a year a few weeks ago..
I will not drink today.
Just for today - I will not drink with you all!
day 3 of sobriety :)
Thought I checked in the morning must have forgotten! Didn't drink today off to bed now. Day 24 complete (badge is wrong!) goodnight folks.
IWNDWYT!  
IWNDWYT 
Hey my badge is working! Thank mods!..Ok into it now.  3:16 was my first sober day and it's been going pretty smoothly so far until today.  I'm lurking on here I'm lurking over on r/keto a lot too; been doing that a few months now. So!  Middle of the day doesn't this out-of-the-blue 'Man I could go for [redacted] and a pizza.'  I wrestled the pizza part down pretty good.  Pfft; bread. :P  But the first bit was killing me.  I got home and chugged some LaCroix.  Maybe I was just thirsty?  I brewed my usual (of late) pot of coffee.  And I'm hanging on and getting control back.  I will not drink with you tonight!
Having a terrible day due to affects from drinking yesterday. I will not drink today. I'm so broken.
day 2 - going to the gym tonight instead of any other shenanigans
I want to stop drinking.... The morning depression is fucking hell
Today was not an easy one. I am 9 days sober and I got home this morning (I work 3rd shift) to find my girlfriend had moved out. We weren't good but I still wanted to grab a case and just go to town on it but I didn't. I got a soda water and called a friend to talk about it a little before retiring to bed for the day. I made it through even when I thought there was no way I could...&amp;#x200B;..IWNDWYT
Hey ya'll.  Day 2 and I will not drink today.

Was feeling alright and thought I'd even go to the gym tonight... then my focus zoomed in on the liquor store right next to my gym! Gonna avoid temptation and wait for a better day..I will not drink with you today.

Day 2 here we go. IWNDWYT 
My 3rd day alcohol free! It is so hard to do it on my own I know this subreddit helps and reading/responding to posts helps but physically I'm on my own but it is possible!
About to hit the sack but I didn't drink today!
10 minutes left in my day but I am NOT drinking today. 101 days sober.
I will not drink with you today

I just woke up to an angry neighbor saying he will contact the landlord the next time I cry so loud. I'm in a new country all alone. No friends. No family around. I know my chips are stacked against me. I am so hopeless. I don't know what to do. My depression is flaring up everyday. I think about quitting everyday. I think I've had enough. I won't drink with you today. 
IWNDWYT!
