A little background: I have struggled with mental illness and addiction for well over a decade. I frequently would self-medicate with booze which always turned into an uncontrollable drunkorexic multi-day binge. I have experienced many negative consequences from my drinking realized I can't continue on like this and recently started AA. ..Yesterday I removed all alcohol and evidence of alcohol from my house. Bags and bags of bottles and cans. I took them to the redemption center and made $11 and change. I am putting that money in the collection basket at my next AA meeting. It feels good not having to look at it anymore. Making my house happier and healthier for the holidays.
