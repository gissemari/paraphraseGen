I've been reading [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Road-Most-Traveled-Chuck-Ragan/dp/0982065140) and there's a quote in there by a guy named Casey Cress:..'Rock bottom is a terrible place to be and worse when you're too drunk to stand up and climb out on your own'..It hit home so hard I thought I'd share. Nothing more. It helps me realise where I was and why I was doing so terribly. 70 days of newfound happiness in the pocket. Struggling most days but I'm so much happier than I was.

I'm thankful that I had some strong hands helping me get up from that rock bottom.  That was a sad place to be...Good quote. 
Oh gawd....I remember a time that I fell down while drunk and I literally could not get back up no matter how many times I tried so that really hit home. Thankfully if we keep trying to get and stay sober and don't give up on ourselves eventually we will be able to stand sober on our own steady two feet. Having supportive hands to guide me really made all the difference. ..Grats on your 70 days levb1 and keep it up!
Good quote. I can definitely relate to it. Also reminds me of a quote from comedian Marc Maron "it's surprising how elastic rock bottom can be." Meaning that sometimes we hit rock bottom without noticing and we stretch it further than necessary.
