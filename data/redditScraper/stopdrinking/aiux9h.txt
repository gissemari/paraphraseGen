I've been feeling a bit down myself but it looks like posts about struggles and cravings are up. I don't point it out to criticize this is where you should be if you are in need of support but I just noticed it...Maybe it's the post-holiday slump? Maybe I'm just projecting...

Blue Monday. The most depressing day of the year.
4 degrees wind chill of minus 20 and sideways snow has proven challenging to my attitude of gratitude.
i feel this lately myself and was attributing it to the gray weather we've had lately where i live but i think you are right.  Post-holiday slump is real.  ..Most notably if I see Christmas lights/decorations still up on or in a house after New Years I get a horrible heavy feeling in the pit of my stomach.  It makes me super sad for some reason.
The Astro weather was really bad last week and the full moon paired with the lunar eclipse was not auspicious but this week is supposed to be way better and much more productive.
I blame the eclipse
Moon screws with me head
