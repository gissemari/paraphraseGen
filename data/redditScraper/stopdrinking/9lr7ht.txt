I am hurt and disappointed in a colleague and mentor ... Long story but I thought they had my back but I don't think they did. Nothing drastic but feel let down. Usually I'd wallow in it and reach for a glass of wine... Followed by the bottle. Have family staying and we went out for a meal.. I was the driver and found my resolve strong as they had a drink with dinner. So... I'm glad to say that after a hard working week in lots of ways including quitting the wine ..I am going to bed clear headed and looking forward to the weekend. Reading here throughout the day hearing all the stories is really affirming regardless of number of days relapse stories resolve stories ... Whatever it may be. Thank you soberheads IWNDWYT

Well done! Part of sobriety is navigating challenges as they come up and it sounds like you're doing that really well!!
Congratulations on staying strong! I can't always  control outside events ...but I can choose not to drink.  Keep on truckin'! IWNDWYT 
Good work! For me every temptation/urge i avoid has meant that the next one has become that little bit easier to avoid....Not sure what you're doing to help you maintain strength and resolve but I've found podcasts immensely useful on top of this reddit group. The three I've found and listen to a LOT are The Recovery Elevator Recovery Rockstar and The Bubble Hour..Looking forward to waking up refreshed and sober tomorrow morning with you and the rest of the gang in here!
