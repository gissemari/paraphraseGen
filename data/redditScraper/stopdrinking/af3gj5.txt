So here we are late on a Friday night and I'm drinking tea.  Just a few weeks ago I'd be working my way through a 6 or 12 pack and planning what I was going to get for my weekend drinking...&amp;#x200B;..Ever since I poured out my last few beers on the 30th I've been sober.  NYE was surprisingly easy to not drink the party I was at was hosted by a pregnant lady and no one batted an eye at me declining an offer of a beer.  And that was that just a night of games and lots of laughs.  Fast forward a couple days after NYE and I am struggling work was a complete shitshow I was stressed about money and bills.......I knew there were two liquor stores within walking distance (one I knew was a bit of a hike but I've walked farther).  I can't think of the last time I was more disgusted with myself for even contemplating going to get more alcohol...&amp;#x200B;..I've been slowly telling people around me I've quit I just told my close friends at work that I'm sober and they all said they were proud and I could tell that they meant it.  My ex wife is proud of me I know that seems odd but we're still close and my best friends know and support me 100%.  I knew going into sobriety it was going to be a struggle and I knew I needed a way to keep myself honest.  I guess this subreddit will have to be my stand in journal but I'm ok with that decision.  You all have been exceptionally open and supportive of me and others who post on here and I think I hope I pray that this time sobriety will stick.

I'm going on 3 years. Own the shit out of it make it a strength not a burden laugh about it joke about it talk about it. Own your sobriety or the addiction will end up owning you. ..Love you be safe and way to go! 
Congratulations on nearly two weeks! The first two weeks were the toughest for me.  Keep on truckin'! IWNDWYT
