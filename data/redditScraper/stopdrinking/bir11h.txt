I've been struggling a lot lately. I've been lying to people in my support network about my sobriety. Things got way out of hand this weekend and I almost burned my apartment down. My clothes smell like smoke and I'm kind of terrified about going home tonight. I'm clutching my 24 hour chip. At least I know a drink wont fix anything.

Lean away. ..I'm sending you all of the thoughts and love &lt;3
Getting honest was the hardest and most fulfilling thing I did. I lied about everything mainly because I didn't trust anyone because I didn't trust myself. I knew I'd lie at the drop of a hat. When I trusted the people that supported me to tell them the truth and found out that they meant what they said I learned I could mean what I say. It was not easy by any means and felt weird in the beginning. I have found this sub to be very helpful by all means lean on us. IWNDWYT
Time to get honest man it makes this thing a whole lot easier. You can do it. I'm not saying let it all out just dont lie.

I hope this is the beginning of a new and better life for you. Thank goodness your apartment didn't burn down!! I'm sending you thoughts and hoping each day is better for you. Take care.
You're right - a drink will absolutely not fix anything and it's great you recognize that. I've got some tough situations on my plate as well but drinking will make all of that worse. It will prevent me from being present and aware and from handling my situation properly.
You can do it!  Just relax and don't overthink it.  You'll be just fine.  Iwndwyt!
