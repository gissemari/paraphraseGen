Last time round it was easier. Last time round it was blue skies and positivity. ..This time 140+ days in its a struggle and its been a struggle since day 1. Its not the not drinking as such its life. It feels like I've broken that part of me that knows how to be happy and not anxious and I'm afraid it'll never come back. ..I'm seeing a therapist I've started anti-depression meds I'm doing all the right things to improve my life but I feel like I'm still wallowing around at the bottom of the well. I'm so frustrated with me and my inability to get it together. It has to get better.

Oh how I relate!.I keep telling myself "I'm doing everything I can to make MY life better".Stay the course and don't feel weird about putting yourself first!
Thanks for your post. I started anti-depression meds a while ago and it was a huge turning point for my life from awful to much better. There was an adjustment period where I felt weird at times but that passed and my depression right along with it. It saved my life. It does get better very soon.
