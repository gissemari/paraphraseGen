So this women I know socially (kids go to the same school) has now called me twice for help when her boyfriend and father of their infant has been drunk/violent. I have gone over there in the middle of the night offered her a place to stay etc. The thing is that they are both heavy heavy drinkers. As a mother my heart breaks for her kids but there is only so much one can do. The real kicker for me was that the day after I get the middle of the night phone call for help I see them at this festival I was working at. It is the middle of the day and they have all the kids in tow and are getting drunk like really drunk. Its just insane the pain and destruction that alcohol causes and yet you go back for more. I can identify with the struggle but I also know that as a mother I would do anything for my kids and seeing this women put herself right back in the situation was just so insane and frustrating. You can only help people who want to help themselves so in this case I feel like I need to step away.
