Because I essentially am. Safety net being that when things get to hard I can get blitzed. I'm on day 2 and that's the thing that keeps gnawing at me.  There's no check out option now. After struggling with alcohol for 13 years that feels really scary to me. It also sharpens for me the reason I drink.  Idk how I will ever pull this off but I can say that IWNDWYT. Tomorrow's may be a different story but you have my word for today

A sober you is your safety net.  Your decisions will always be better when not marinated in alcohol.  You're still gonna mess up but you can be aware of it and will care enough to fix it when you do now.
Yeah this is still a fear of mine. That alcohol is the only way to really let loose and there will come a time when the  relief  it brings is the only thing on my mind. But unfortunately I've been brainwashed into believing that's true. All my time sober (a whopping 90ish days) have told me that's not true. There is a fantastic life out there for me with healthy coping mechanisms. I just need to tune out my brain when it tries to frame getting blasted as the only one.
I feel challenged by having to be present all the time and deal with my emotions rather than numbing them with alcohol...But I'm sorting things out in my head rather than running away from them. And it's really helping...Don't feel unsafe without your numbing option. It's a really crap one. 
I can relate. You start doing things saving money and the thought pops into your head "I can't wait to spend this money on booze weed cigs etc." but then you remember that you can't.
