Because I don't want to admit I am struggling. . .This is my first post on this sub so Hi!. .So some history. I was an every day need to drink vodka guzzler I'm 25 pretty severe anxiety before I started drinking so... I'm sure you can imagine how I feel right now ha. I am from the UK. I've quit with my long distance SO. & we are both on day 11. The longest I have been sober in 3 years. Past most of the physical crap... except the sleep & I am still getting headaches.. .So... today has probably been the hardest for mental cravings. I just feel SO desperate for a drink. My anxiety is through the roof. I have tried to distract myself all day. But nothing is shutting my brain up. I am so scared I will slip that I have been avoiding my partner because I don't want him to see me like this... especially if i screw up.. .I'm at a loss right now. My brain is screaming "what's the harm in having a few?" & I am starting to think it would just be easier to give in.. .Right now I am figuring a way to get my hands on some. I thought posting this might at least help me to see I am being stupid. This behaviour is not normal.. .I thought it would be easier after the physical hell I went through.

&gt; This behaviour is not normal...It's normal for this group!  Many of us have been there.  One thing I wish someone told me when I was early on in sobriety: early sobriety is a relatively short period of time.  When you're a few months into it these days you're having now will seem like a distant memory.  Knowing that it's a relatively short period of time do whatever it takes to stay sober.  I bought a new gadget to occupy my time (an Android tablet).  I tried out fancy sodas and coffees.  I tried a bunch of different teas.  I bought or rented movies and TV shows.  I spoiled myself with cookies and ice cream.  And before I knew it (after a couple weeks) I no longer had to distract myself from wanting to drink. ..Good luck.
Congrats on doing what's very difficult for most of us that struggle with this disease admitting that there's a problem and reaching out for help.  Both of those actions were very difficult for me...The anxiety sleeplessness hopefully the obsession - these things all will pass.  Try not to get caught in the rituals where you planned your drinking - that's very hard to break free from once the body/mind is in motion.  ..Remember that physical hell that you went through because you'll just have to go through it again.  This disease is a hell of thing because it's going to tell you that it wasn't that bad or a few won't hurt etc.  For me it's never a few but rather a whole bottle.  ..Keep fighting the fight and continue to ask for help.  It gets better and this may help: the definition of submit is to join the winning side...I wish you all the best.  
I'm also 25 an I also quit with my long distance SO! Weird...Posting here helps me when I have moments like you're having! Also the IRC is good for that too. Welcome!
The other thing that I found incredibly important was to focus entirely on what little segment of time I need to get through to be successful.  In my case it was just 1 day. I only need to stay sober TODAY.  I can drink tomorrow if I want to but I'm not drinking TODAY.  Now tomorrow morning I plan to stay sober but who knows tomorrow is not here.  Stay focused on NOW...One of the mods /u/offtherocks created a spreadsheet that helped him get through and he broke the targets into even smaller segments that he checked off or filled in as he achieved them...Finally here's the promise don't give in--and it will get easier.  
How fit are you? My suggestion- strap on some running shoes get out of the house and run until the urge passes. Then turn around and run back home. :)
peas0up I might recommend a strategy that I use whenever I get cravings. Keep a rubber band around your wrist. Now don't only use this for craving drinking. Use this as well for whenever you feel a **negative** thought in general. Any time you feel negativity or a craving pull the band back and snap it on your wrist. **Hard.** Keep this up. Everyone is different but for me it trained me to halt my negative thinking. Once I stopped that the cravings followed.
You know everything you've gone through for the past 11 days do you really want to go through all that again?  This part absolutely sucks but if you do it right you will only have to go through it THIS ONE TIME.  Your mind and body are in the process of recalibrating; your mind especially has not had to produce it's own dopamine for a while because alcohol did that job.  It's going to take time and yes it's going to be unpleasant to go through.  You're not like a regular sober person right now - you are Knurd (that is you are through soberness and out the other side) things seem and feel worse than they actually are.  (I nicked that from Terry Pratchett he makes a valid point).  Every day you go without alcohol your mind and body are learning how to do without it more and more.  Hang in there it WILL get better and you will be glad that you did. 
It took me about 3 weeks to feel somewhat normal. It takes time but be careful after about a month you'll forget how bad it was and be tempted to have just one again.

&gt; My brain is screaming "what's the harm in having a few?" &amp; I am starting to think it would just be easier to give in...My wisdom (for what it's worth) is that it is *definitely* easier to give in but what will be easier in the long run? I struggle with this same feeling often and I try to imagine myself where I'll be a few hours from now if I don't drink vs. if I do. In this light not drinking is invariably the better choice for me.
I know how you feel.I usually want to come post positive things because I want to be a positive person...It's important to post when you feel down or you need help Not only is it good for you but I guarantee there is at least one other person out there who is feeling the same way but can't or won't post about it. So really you're helping lots of people when you get the help you need!
11 days is awesome.  What are you doing now?  Are you in the UK or from the UK living elsewhere?  Let us know how before you go for that drink.  You've probably made it through the craving by now.
[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2035oh/lots_of_new_subscribers_this_is_what_helped_me/) is how I stayed sober my first month.  You're doing great and you're almost at 14 days which is a milestone!
