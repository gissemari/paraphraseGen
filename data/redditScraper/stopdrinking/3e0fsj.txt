Seven days sober and I don't even feel like a drink. After two years of knowing with absolute certainty that I had to stop and a constant parade of meetings relapses and the odd hospital visit I feel like I've actually finally managed to make the change I needed in my life. I'm sober and I genuinely intend to stay that way...I'm cooking liver tonight. To celebrate.

Congrats on 7 days! Here's to many more for both of us. 
Congrats! I love liver and onions too!
