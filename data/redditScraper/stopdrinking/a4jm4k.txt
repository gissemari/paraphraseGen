It's been a pretty wild ride and to be honest a particularly stressful year BUT not drinking throughout it has definitely been the best self care I could have given myself. .I've learnt so much about myself my loved ones and society in general. Giving up alcohol is truly the best thing I have ever done for myself. To those of you struggling with your decision push through. The rewards are infinitesimal

Congratulations!!! Last thursday was 12 months for me. It's great to have the feeling of inner-peace. And when I don't have it I know how to regain it :)
Well done.  Thanks for sharing.  ..I love to read post about living happy joyous and free lives without alcohol.  ..To thine own self be true. 
Great job! Very happy for your success!
Congrats my friend 
Congratulations 
I hope you'll forgive my pointing this out but your freudian slip of using 'infinitesimal' instead of 'infinite' is hilarious. Having only 11 days myself right now the rewards DO feel infinitesimal and I laughed as I related to that. I hope to soon have your joy at my own sobriety and to be encouraging others the way you're doing. Thank you.
Congratulations!! Good luck to you in the future!!
Excellent work. I'm at 6 months today and couldn't agree more 
Go you! Amazing achievement :) IWNDWYT
