I quit drinking 3 months ago after my wife moved out with the kids and kept them from me for 2 weeks. I got a lawyer involved and fought her for 50/50. Naturally being half Irish I hit the Jameson Irish Whisky straight pretty hard for a few weeks in effort to cope with the sudden change in life circumstances at the time. Of course that only made matters worse and it was only a matter of time before I would have likely ended up losing my shared custody of my kids because I couldn't handle them when I was miserable and depressed on the days I had them and wasn't drinking. 3 plus months sober now and healthier than I have ever been in my life at 39. Hitting the gym eating super clean runnig 7km a week lost 20 lbs more energy generally happier the list goes on. But I'm not here to boast. I just want to share the other side for those who may be still struggling like I was. I was pretty much willing to drink myself into oblivion but I  realized one night during a drunken evening of self introspection that  although my wife doesn't want or need me any longer my 3 kids certainly still do. So the choice was pretty clear. Sober up or lose them too. So I quit and detoxed at home. It was fucking awful for the first few weeks. But I had to do it. Today I found a case of Budweiser Prohibition non-alcoholic 0.0% beer at my local Costco (in Canada) and I think I have found my happy medium. Work hard all day in the sun and still enjoy a cold (near) beer without the worry of consuming any alcohol. There are always compromises in life. Some for the better.

This reads like the blurb to a particularly gritty movie starring Liam Neeson. It'll be a great story for the kids when they are older. Well done the hardest battles are those we fight within ourselves.
You're doing right by your kids. And yourself. Keep it going!
