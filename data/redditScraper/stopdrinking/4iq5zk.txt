Hiya. You aren't a failure. Failure isn't a lack of success. Failure is a lack of Get Up after a fall. You also didn't lose that time. That time MEANS something : you did it. And **you can do it again**.  ..."As things go wrong as they sometimes will and the road you're on seems all uphill.   ...When the funds are low and the debts are high and you want to smile but can only *sigh*.   ...When care is pressing you down a bit. Rest if you must yet *you mustn't quit.*". ..Hang on friend. 
You are not the first to throw away some time and you won't be the last. Any day spent sober for an alcoholic like me is a great fucking day. I support you getting sober again and sobriety is worth the work. Remember the difficulty lies in the first couple days... After that we just learn to cope with life as it comes.
