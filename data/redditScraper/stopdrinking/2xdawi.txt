Hey /SD..Almost to the 10 month mark  and I've encountered something strange. ..In order to graduate next semester I had to complete an elective course on art and social protest and a majority of the themes are involved in some dark hedonistic viewpoints.  It's had me thinking about old mentalities living fast and dying young and all that.  Suffice to say I don't agree any more but it's kind of like having a conversation with someone I used to be and I know far too well where that type of thinking will lead...Some of the topics have been difficult to deal with and I've been losing sleep because of it which tends to just create all kinds of problems as I suffer from Bipolar disorder.  The result is basically insane lucid dreams when I do sleep anxiety and depression.  ..It just blows me away how powerful the monster I spent 10 years creating (most of which in my father's garage) will continue to pop up and try to convince me that self destruction is the only way to actually be "living".  I love my life now I like being sober my family is happy I'm sober I eat healthy I'm close to graduating I exercise I don't wake up with embarrassing things to explain from the night before from drinking. ..And yet I'm struggling.  I know this will pass and this is in no way an example of my sobriety as a whole but I just hope getting this out there will speed up the process a little bit or at least lighten the load.  Thanks for being here /sd.

You know what Corrr living a sober life is the most punk rock of all the paths. I'm not saying that just to be clever. Henry Rollins once said that questioning everything and anything to him was punk rock and I think choosing to live the life fully examined and not living through a bottle takes guts and strength of character because you have to step away from the typical social pacifiers and take a serious  account of what matters to you. 
10 months wow that's the time it takes to brew a human baby in utero. So substantial in such a short amount of time.  ..But if we think about human development babies come out really vulnerable and impressionable sounds like the path of sobriety might have some similar characteristics only you're able sort through it all and have a bit of existential experience.   ..Feels as if I'll never get through this process and can't seem to speed up.  Then I remember that I'm sober I've already reached the ship now it's time to enjoy the voyage rocky seas and all..
