Spring is in the air or at least it's trying to be here in the North East US and before you know it summer will be upon us. And with the nice weather comes long holiday weekends cookouts vacations maybe some weekends at the beach. All good times for sure but these situations can also be intimidating and sometimes difficult to navigate for someone trying to stay sober. With a little prompting from my friend u/embryonic_journey :) I thought it would be a good time to share some of the tools I've used to help me get through the fun times sober. And if the idea of summer and vacationing is too far away for you to think about right now and fill you with a sense of dread have no fear! These helpful tools can be used anytime like today!..The first tool is HALTS a handy acronym to remember to address your physical needs when cravings rear their ugly head. ..**H**ungry..**A**ngry..**L**onely..**T**ired..**S**tressed..I can't count the number of times my urge to drink dissipated once I stopped and assessed what my body was feeling and took care of that need. Sometimes when I think I really want a drink it turns out I really just need to eat a sandwich...Next up is DEADS another acronym in my tool box that gives me a plan of action when I find myself in tough situations. ..**D**elay..**E**scape..**A**void..**D**ispute..**S**ubstitute..Whenever I go on vacation now I write out a DEADS plan along with HALTS to [carry with me in my wallet](https://imgur.com/QHwlewA). When I find myself wanting to drink despite the fact that I *really* don't want to drink I can consult the list and take action. It also helps me to remember that as much as I think I want to drink in that moment it mattered enough to me to physically write out a plan ahead of time so I better stick to it!..Lastly is Play the Tape Forward. This is a great tool because it can be used anytime anywhere at any moment. It's a thought exercise that helps to take an honest look at what *just one drink* really means. For me I like to imagine out the worst case scenarios and play the tape forward into the subsequent days and consequences. How far would I let one drink go 2? 3? 10? Till I black out? Till I drive drunk into something or someone? What stupid mean horrible things will I say? What's tomorrow going to feel like? What will be my mental state from having relapsed? Will it have been worth it? For me when I play the tape all the way through the answer to the last question has always been no...So there you have it some of the tools that have helped me get and stay sober. I learned them right here on SD and I hope they can help out somebody else. What are your tools strategies and plans fellow sobernauts? Please feel free to share them here and lets help each other out because [Knowledge is Power!](https://imgur.com/SE2woYE).

Needed this today! Awesome ideas thank you!!
Thank you for sharing. I will not drink with you today.
&gt; I write out a [...] plan..I do this too and it's helped me more than anything. I really liked what you wrote about that it mattered enough at one point to write it out. When I get a craving for a drink my brain has a hard time remembering the motivation it had during the stronger moments. Writing that down and reading it during those weaker moments really helps remind me of the determination I had when I wrote the stuff originally and snaps me back out of wanting a drink. Thanks for sharing the great post!
This is great! I want to get in the habit of using these tools so that it becomes second nature. Thanks for posting!
These are great. I'm only starting but something I've been doing for reinforcement (this is kinda dumb) is this little mantra with my hand. I really like the phrase IWNDWYT and now I think to myself "I will not drink today" touching a finger to my thumb as i say each word starting with index then making a fist on the last one. It helps me feel strong. 
One of reason I love Reddit and esp this sub all the great help and advice.  Thanks for sharing!  IWNDWYT 
Great tools!..I have a piece of paper that I keep in my wallet that says "One day at a time" on one side and on the other it says "Instead of drinking..." which is followed by a list of things I could be doing instead of drinking. My idea is to have it at the front of my wallet so that if I ever feel the need to buy booze I'll be confronted by this card and the better choices listed on it. If anyone is interested I can provide a printable template later today (I'm on my way to work right now and don't have the file on me). 
HALTS saved me so many times.  Why I really liked it is because it gave me a preventative strategy too.  I'd ask myself is doing this thing today a good idea?  I'll be exhausted and starving won't that be an issue?  Or I need to decrease the amount of stress in my life because that puts me at risk.
intriguing news. 
Good post thanks!
Thank you for posting friend. ..Tonight I am not going to be able to avoid at least three of my triggers at the same time. I'm not feeling so confident at the moment. Maybe these tools will help. ..655 days you are an inspiration!
I'd also like to share something that might be obvious to others but I rarely see it mentioned here. ...Allow your craving to be heard!!!...Everyone now and again a little voice pops up in my head. "Sure it is a very sunny day a nice cold glass of wine would be nice"....Previously using DEADS or the like this would send my body into panic mode and I'd try everything I could to silence this thought. Me trying to silence it would make the voice then get louder and louder as it fought to be heard. In my panic and fustration I would lose confidence and the craving would win....These days I listen to my cravings. You know what a cold glass of wine on a hot day would be nice. But that's all it is nice. And being sober is nicer so that drink is not something worth obsessing over....Stopping drinking doesn't mean that alcohol will stop being an enjoyable experience. There's no point denying it and treating like every craving you have is a personal failure. Acknowledge your cravings accept them and move on....
I found early in that 90 percent of my craving was hunger and/or thirst..Just eating a meal was enough 
I never heard of DEADS before thank you for posting about it! Many of my triggers are often unavoidable and both HALT as well as relieving HALT (eating relaxing resting etc) can give me cravings but delaying may work!..I recently realised that when I'm colouring (like those complex colouring books) it just makes me procrastinate everything else to death. Sometimes I really need to go to the toilet or sleep or do some simple task but nooooo let me just colour in one more spot and the next and the next. I think this might work when my evil side brings up the thought  let's just take a quick trip to the convenience store for a drink it'll feel good 
Congrats I appreciate the tools!
