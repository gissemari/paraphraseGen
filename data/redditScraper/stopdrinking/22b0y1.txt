Hello all. Just wanted to check in and say how helpful you all have been since I have been on the subreddit. Six months came and went and I'm still sober and grateful to be here...One year ago today I hit my rock bottom and was in the hospital because I had reached my limit. I was completely and utterly powerless over alcohol and it was evident in that alcohol had taken over my life. I am still powerless over alcohol but now I have taken the road to recovery and taken alcohol out of my life...Is this easy? No. I slipped up over the course of the past year as is evidenced by my badge number. Do I wish I could still drink? No. I know that I can't drink like people who aren't alcoholics because when I do drink I drink alcoholically. Sobriety may be hard but it is a hell of a lot easier than drinking every day than hiding that drinking than trying to throw away all of those empty bottles without others noticing than trying to exist as an anxious hungover zombie when I'm not drinking than lying to everyone I know and who loves me about the problem that I have...Surrender for me meant accepting that I am not perfect and that I don't need to be perfect. I will always struggle with that but now at least alcohol isn't getting in the way...Thanks for letting me share.

Congratulations on finding sobriety and good luck on being successful with the next six months
Grats! 
Accepting imperfection is powerful. To me it meant I could continue trying to become a sober person despite imperfection in the pursuit. ..Congrats and thanks for sharing this milestone.
Well done!
