I went 17 days without a drink before I decided to grab a 6 pack. That 6 pack turned into 5 days in a row. I'm at work right now and all I can think about is making it through day one again. Just need to constantly remind myself of how good I feel when I'm clean. Drinking is not even fun anymore yet I choose to do it. I just had to get this off my chest. Thank you for reading. Let's have a good day and not drink!

Quitting the drink has been the best thing I have done for myself in a long time. Nice work on those 17 days! Congrats on getting back on the horse!
Drinking stopped being fun for me but it took my brain a long time to accept that reality.  Once I did it was helpful because I knew I wasn't missing out on anything.  ..Welcome back! IWNDWYT 
Glad you are back with us...Let's not drink today. ..Let's not worry about yesterday or tomorrow. I won't if you won't.
Been there done that. Just keep going 
Good work on those 17 days! I know I slipped up many times before it stuck every day without alcohol is a victory regardless. What caused you to pick up again? Do you have any insights as to how to prevent and or fight that in the future?
