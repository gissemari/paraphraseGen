Yesterday was a pretty good day for me. Went to work and came home and had an enjoyable day reading and playing some video games. Around 4:30 drinking came across my mind and then that's all that I could think about. I was rationalizing why it would be okay for me to go get just a few of those shot bottles from the liquor store because if I didn't buy a fifth or handle if have to stop after a few shots. ..I managed to push off those thoughts because I attend a martial arts school and the classes started at 6:30. But between the start of those thoughts and martial arts I simply wanted a drink. I made it through that time and then went to class and felt amazing. I went home and didn't have a care in the world. I went to sleep sober and this morning I had a deep almost philosophical discussion about history with my dad. That is something I probably wouldn't have been able to do if I had even just a few last night. ..Checking in with this sub daily and slowly seeing the number getting bigger for days sober is encouraging. My birthday is in a couple of days and I have already had friends say they are going to buy me a drink. I have politely told them what I am doing and most of them respected it. I am excited to make it through a birthday completely sober instead of blackout drunk for a day or even longer. That would be an accomplishment that I have not done in over 4 years. ..Anyone who is struggling with drinking I can say that even though my number of days is low I am starting to feel better about myself and it is worth putting the effort in to not drinking. I challenge you to not drink today!
