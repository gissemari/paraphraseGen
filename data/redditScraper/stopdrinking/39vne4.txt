Two weeks after a sick relapse. Literally. My time back on the drink gave new meaning to the definition of alcoholism as an allergy to alcohol. At first it was manageable until it wasn't. I woke up for three months either blindingly hungover or blindingly hungover and vomiting bile until dinner or next drink. Tmi? Now I'm back. I'm using AA to learn how to cope with life as a sober full time working parent. It's a good system for me right now. Trying to focus on strategies that help me avoid the selfishness and resentment that typically lead me to drink or use. ..I still try and imagine a life in AA and get overwhelmed but I do see immediate and positive benefits to this approach. Most notably a lot of acceptance and support where I have otherwise spent the goodwill and patience of my family. ..My biggest struggle is a mandatory family Sunday dinner at my husbands folks place. A ton of drinking tension and self-destruction all with poor interpersonal skills and a terminally ill father in law who is miserable and (understandably) depressed. For me it's incredibly triggering with the pain drinks always offered and family telling me I'm not alcoholic. But I'm trying to also see that my husband needs to be there for his father and I need to be there for them both. So I'm working my way through that. Making sure to hit a meeting before I go to dinner. Didn't drink made it through another Sunday and another week and grateful to finally be sleeping through the night again. ..How do you all cope with family duty and boundaries?

I always have an escape route for whatever reason.  I normally have an AA meeting I can get to if I think things are going to go south and will go from there...If It were my S.O.'s family she would fight for me to have them quit asking me to drink I would talk to you S.O. and ask for the same.  IF thats something they can not do sometimes going to the family events may be something you should consider not going to.
Staying sober is the best thing you can give your family.  It's a selfish thing especially at first because you have to take care of yourself if you want to take care of others.  The serenity prayer works for me when I get into a rough situation I can't leave.  There will be time when you have extra energy for others but don't feel guilty about doing what you have to for yourself.  The time will come when you can turn your attention to family.  You will be no use to anyone if you drink so that's priority number one right now.  Take care.
