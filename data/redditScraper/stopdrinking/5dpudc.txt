I know I'm new here and in that euphoric stage: 'yay I'm sober and everything is going to be great forever!'  But I know there will be a time when I'm not ok. And I'm going to struggle. This is not my first go-round on the wagon but I'm hoping it will be my last. I've noticed that whenever I start to doubt this new journey reading through all of your stories make it fresh in my mind again. Why I am here. ..Because I'm a 40 year old single mom with a bottle of wine (and most days more like 2) a day habit. The only way I knew how to deal with stress. And panic attacks. And the sh*t-show that is my life. But I've gone to work hungover too many times. Blacked out on my couch in my clothes more times than I can count. Gotten my kids ready for school still half drunk from the night before on a semi-weekly basis. I'm sick of this disgusting wretch of a person that I've become. ..I see you all sharing and see myself in all of your stories. It makes me feel stronger and more committed. And when I struggle I read and remember. And feel all over again the lies that alcohol told me. ..Hoping that this holds and I never forget. I hope if you're struggling that you see yourself in everyone else's stories and that you know that we hear you. We understand. And we are hoping with you. And not drinking with you today.

I'm always a little uncertain of the future and what it may hold.  Hell there are days I find myself worrying about how I'm going to stay sober in the future.  However  the only thing I am in control of is the present.  The only moment that I have any say over is the one that is around me right now.  All I need to do in the meantime is not drink and be the best I can be right now.  This community is amazing.  Not drinking with you today.
