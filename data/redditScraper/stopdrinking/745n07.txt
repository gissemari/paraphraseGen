[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy Hump Day! What's Up Wednesdays are when we celebrate our sobriety see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** As a result of my sobriety and with my doctor's blessing I have been able to stop taking three out of six prescription pills I am supposed to take every day. That's half my medication intake!..**Struggle:** When I was a drinker I hated teetotalers.  I felt they were smug and holier-than-thou and that they wanted to tell me how I should live (which I felt was none of their business). Now as a sober person I struggle because I **so** don't want to become one of those holier-than-thou teetotalers. But when I see a person whose life is being ruined by a drinking problem my heart just breaks...**General:** If you can believe it until recently I had never eaten sweet pie like apple or cherry. My mother is British and never served American food so I just never had it. (Most British pies are savory with meat.) I always wondered "Why is everyone in this country so crazy about pie? I don't get it." ..Then about a month ago in a little village in the Adirondacks I went to a diner that is famous for its pies and ordered a slice of blueberry crumble. I took one bite and said "Okay now I get it.".
----------immediate responses--------

General:  I have a problem with anyone who puts booze in baked goods.  Or maybe I have a problem with baked goods like cake and how much I need it.  I bit into a piece of bundt cake thick with frosting. It tasted like I was making out with some drunk chick at a night club. Yuck. Only eating the icing was far less satisfying.  
**Triumph:** Just been doing my accounts for the summer period and had my best year since setting up 5 years ago. At last it feels like I might actually be able to grow a business.....**Struggle:**...but only if I can get rid of a nasty bout of procrastination that has hit me more recently. I don't know if this is my mind's way of telling me to slow down for a bit but it's causing anxiety. ..**General:** Blackberry &amp; Apple Crumble is the best! We've just come to the end of the blackberry season here so they've been on the menu quite a bit recently.
TRIUMPH: Anxiety levels way down someone told me yesterday I was looking well eating healthier food have started drawing and listening to music again...STRUGGLE: The cravings are gone but am unable to imagine never having a drink again. I work in the drinks business for a start I love good bars and cocktails. So still haven't come to terms with this being a permanent thing...GENERAL: My mood is flat my sleep isn't great life feels a bit grim without the magic of booze. I can't watch the news right now. My weight hasn't budged I weigh the same after two weeks of clean living as I did when I was cheerfully guzzling red wine chocolate pizzas and pasta. Great.
Triumph: Second week. I work at a bar. I have a free drink tab and am surrounded by liquor. I feel extremely confident in my ability to refuse alcohol...Struggle: Ever since quitting. I have had a very strong fear of drinking again. I don't feel the urge to drink but the reflection of who I was drunk and how I acted terrifies me...General: I spent way too long working on my dnd character the other day but I think I know where my build is going to head and I feel adequately optimized 
**Triumph:** I went back to AA because I realised that I need real life community support &amp; I will get that from AA &amp; I can accept that I don't have to agree with all aspects of the program for it to be helpful for me...**Struggle:** I haven't been able to stop smoking yet (did do 8 days) emotionally it is far harder to give up then I was anticipating it feeds that thought process of still needing to self sabotage..... :(..**General:** Procrastination seems to be my new best friend.... I am wasting so much time 'looking' at the things that I want to be doing... e.g Comment on SD nah I'll just keep lurking &amp; reading......  Watch study lectures nah I'll see what other courses I can do.... Finish crochet project nah lets see what other patterns are out there...... lol (I did finish one project!!!)
u/sfgirlmary you just made my day. OMG I can't believe you're off *half* your med's! That's totally amaaaaazzzzzing! Congrats xo &lt;3...Triumph:    While I was drinking I couldn't cook to save my life. I guess I was too busy dumping entire bottles of chardonnay in every pot and pan I had :/. This past week's menu included: grilled lamb chops roasted pork with apples and onions in a cinnamon/nutmeg/butter sauce and pan seared salmon with mango salsa. I now make cooking part of my daily routine and (my SO) couldn't be happier lol!..Struggle:    K's daughter is due to give birth October 11th. I'm getting somewhat anxious about meeting his ex-wife even though they've been divorced for 12 years. Then again I've learned not to *sweat the small stuff* and this is *really small* compared to everything else happening in this world right now...General:    Mary! I'm jealous of that blueberry crumble! My favorite is apple crumble but I've been craving a slice of warm pecan pie with Halo's Pancakes and Waffle ice cream on top. (I've GOT to see if u/stratyturd or u/physis81 have tried this one yet!!??)...&lt;Excuses self to go add more elastic to waistband lol&gt;
Triumph: Actually making friends and relationships with people in AA for this first time in 6 years...struggle: realizing there is a lot more to sobriety than not drinking and having to deal with how much I hate.Myself and how many flaws I've ignored for so long...General: I got to stay at my cousin's house this past week and play with her kitties   I love cats.
Triumph: work conferences used to be a disaster for me.  Guilt hangovers morning long recovery the whole nine yards.  Don't miss that at all.
Triumph: going on day 3!!! Seriously amazing for me. I feel lesss anxiety and I'm encouraged to keep going...Struggle: dealing with daily frustrations in different ways instead of reaching for a liquid memory erasing potion...General: feeling good not to have the anxiety and confusion of a hangover. A little tired here in day 3 so I'll just let myself take it easy. I know I'm getting to a better place.

Triumph: I've quit again and today is Day 2. Spent two hours this morning re-reading This Naked Mind.  I also know how lovely it is to have sober experiences so it'll stick this time.  I know it!..Struggle:  The feeling of starting over again and not feeling like I can tell anyone because I'll look like a spineless loser who can't stick to anything either with not drinking or diet and exercise.  It's the  yeah we've heard THAT before...  thing. Ugh...General: Enjoying the fall season! Basic or not I love pumpkin and squash and cinnamon and apples this time of year and I'm not afraid to enjoy it! My local coffee shop makes their own pumpkin spice syrup for lattes which is exponentially better than what Starbucks dishes out. And a pumpkin spice bagel with honey butter doesn't go amiss on a chilly morning either! Happy fall Northern Hemisphere!
**Triumph:** Actually keeping up with exercising and have been since August. Been keeping up with running every other day (mostly). Strength training a few times a week as well. This is longest I've kept up an exercise routine in many years. ..**Struggle:** It has been hard to maintain my diet recently. I've been doing keto since May and can't seem to stick with it. I love how I feel when I'm on it but I can't get past some of the sugar/savory cravings...**General:** I have a four-day weekend coming up because of the holiday and am going to try and catch up on reading and maybe watch a movie or two. Been thinking of doing the National Novel Writing Month thing in November. 
**Triumph:** 2 days in and last night I slept properly for the first time in a long time. Stayed asleep for a solid 6 hours and even had some nice dreams :)    .**Struggle:** I have a meeting with my advisor later and will have to explain that I'm far behind schedule. I wont tell him it's because I was drunk for two months so I hope he'll just accept that I've made some mistakes and am behind.    .**General:** I really want some pie now! Feeling thankful for this community and happy to be here
Triumph: I just woke up to my first day sober! I only had 7 hours sleep (I need at least 20 haha) and I feel more rested than I've have been in ages...Struggle: I have a shift at work tonight in a bar and I know I'm going to struggle pulling pints and making G&amp;Ts without having a drink after my shift as usual :( wish me luck!..Xo
Triumph: I made it to my 5 am gym session for a week ..Struggle: I can't let go of my morning cigarette :/..General: I'm so excited for the sober holidays! My family are big drinkers and I look forward to remembering the quality time spent with them and my daughters first holidays :) ...
**Triumph:** I stepped on the scale this morning and I've lost 10 lbs! I know that'll fluctuate a bit but I'm still thrilled that weight loss and other fitness/diet goals are going well...**Struggle:**I'm a little lonely. I'm used to it but it's not fun. I'm also really nauseous right now and I really don't want to go home today...**General:** Since I have nothing going on this weekend I'm planning a small camping trip near a really good bouldering area. I can't wait!
Triumph: Realised a trigger yday regarding some social behaviour many people. Also withdrawals from coffee has stopped and feel a lot better without it...Struggle: Today not really anything felt like shit yday though but that was then and related to above social stuff. ..General: Put an order for L-Theanine a couple days ago looking forward to try it and it seems harmless :) 
Triumph: My anxiety is starting to fade and I get excited for the mundane things again. (Tv shows playing with my baby first thing in the mornings delicious coffee creamers..)..Struggle: the area around my liver has a very dull/slight ache. It's not my gallbladder because I had that removed a month and a half ago. I know I've likely got inflammation going on but am hoping with abstinence it will start to feel better. I've had my liver enzymes checked and had a full CT scan of my abdominal organs and everything was good. ..General: my 3 month old baby is having a sleep regression and whereas he was sleeping for like 5-6 hours at a time at night now he's waking every couple hours and I'm soooo exhausted. No options to squeeze naps in because I have other kids to care for but I am such a better mom sober regardless of exhaustion or not!!
Triumph: Just making it this long without drinking is triumph enough for right now. I'm feeling very good about getting over a lot of withdrawal symptoms and my mood is getting better...Struggle: I used alcohol to dull stress and anxiety and I am trying to find ways of working through these problems without alcohol. Booze never made problems go away but I didn't care as much about them. I know I can do it but when you stop running and turn around and face what's been chasing you we'll that is challenging for me. 
Triumph:    Tonight I'm going to see a screening of Monty Python and The Holy Grail with a Live Q&amp;A with John Cleese afterword with my Dad.  ..Struggle:  It's getting closer to the months where I'm a shut in.  The winter was always a tough time for me because there was nothing to do but drink.  ..General: Not quite a pie but I will murder a hobo for a good cobbler.  Blackberry preffered but peach will do in a pinch. 
**Triumph:** I just found a room in a new apartment which I didn't think I'd as easily as I have done. Great price location and nice sized room. Available now too...**Struggle:** I have  20 to last me until the 11th...**General:** I never bothered watching GoT and thought surely no series can live up to so much hype. Turns out it does. Looks like I'll be wasting 3 hours a day binge watching it for the next few weeks. For fuck's sake.
**T:**  Getting my house in order.  It's good to get some of the chaos under control...**S:** Found out my ex has been drinking again.  It's really upsetting me for various reasons.  She doesn't know that I know.  I'm debating confronting her about it.  I'm not sure it'd do any good.  I've known about a couple slips but this is not sitting well with me.  She hasn't been diagnosed with anything but I believe she has some serious mental problems.  I'm thinking at least bipolar and borderline personality disorder.  That plus alcohol equals a potentially volatile situation.  Anyways this complicates things even more in an already too complicated situation...**G:**  I haven't tried Halo top on some warm pecan pie.  Actually still haven't tried Halo top yet.  Glad to see Polar got some HP time in.
Triumph: I keep pushing through and coming back everyday. I've been working on my diet and fitness levels. And just feel like I'm heading in the right direction...Struggle: I seriously have a sugar problem like anytime anything stressful comes up at all all I want to do is eat a whole cake to myself. I'm not even exaggerating. I'm trying to overcome with more protein water tea and sleep. ..General: Life is a bitch. 
Triumph:  I have all the balls in the air right now and I'm juggling them not dropping them none of the balls are on fire!.Struggle:  I still think about drinking in moderation.  Yesterday was a struggle deluxe and I fought with my husband.  .General:  Wednesday is good.  I got this day!
Triumph: FINALLY got a physical last week for the first time in 18 years!  Everything looked fine EKG normal got blood results Monday and everything is good!  This was actually a surprise. Obviously thankful my liver appears ok but I was worried about blood sugar and other stuff as well.  For years I had a deep suspicion that I was not healthy but was afraid to go to the doctor.  What a relief. I have been walking and doing light exercise for a few months but this week decided to start running VERY gradually. Yesterday was the first time since 2003 that I ran for more than 30 consecutive seconds. ...Struggle: after a good day everything crumbled last night over stupid bullshit that completely destroyed my mood. It is the dumbest shit just something that came in the mail that I will have to spend a few hours on the phone fixing today. It was not worth ruining my good mood and the fact that it did pissed me off even more!  I am alive and healthy and things could be so much worse. I am still trying to learn how to not let small shit upset me. ...General:  I spend a lot of time in self reflection and I dare say self absorption. Right now my thoughts are not just on myself and my stupid problems but the many many people affected by the latest mass murder in my country in one of my favorite cities. Also with Puerto Rico everyone else whose lives were affected or even ruined by the recent hurricanes and Tom Petty a legend who will be missed. He died too soon as do most of us but I feel he would want us to be positive about the life that he had and the great work that will live on.
TRIUMPH: I've had plenty of opportunity to drink (I live in a bar) but have taken none. I'd always thought that I'd need to move out if I ever wanted to get sober. Going strong...STRUGGLE: Without alcohol anaesthetising my depression it's clear that I've got a lot of work to do to get onto better terms with myself. It's confusing and intimidating...GENERAL: I accidentally left a pineapple in one of my storage boxes and now all the stuff in that box smells of off pineapple. I bought another pineapple and I've no idea where I put it.
Congratulations on the reduction in medications.  That is wonderful news!.**Triumph:**  I have begun meditating in the mornings again and love having that little piece of time and quiet all to myself.  It's hard work staying focused but I think it's an important part of retraining my neural pathways and slowing down the automatic reaction of reaching for instant gratification...**Struggle:**  During a beautiful hike last weekend I realized I was pretty numb to the beauty and normally energizing effects of the exercise.  It scared me.  Exercise in nature is my medicine and if it doesn't work I'm worried.  I think I've been shutting down a little bit to protect myself from the horrible news of the world and from the draining effects of my job.  And I can't just stay "unshut" for the parts of life that feel good.  Everything suffers when I shut down.  I had to deliberately tell myself to open up and appreciate the beauty of the moment.  It did help but I think I really do need that meditation to keep me open in the moment instead of shutting down when things feel scary or painful...**General:**  I WANT ALL THE PIE.  I'm on 2 months of a paleo challenge so no sugar for me 'til Thanksgiving.  And then I'mma bake an apple pie and maybe even make a chocolate cream pie.  Mmmmm.....
Hey guys! ..Triumph: Passed my practical exam today with distinction! Can't imagine how I'd have got through with no preparation and a foggy head and shaky hands. Go me!..Struggle: My feline friend is unwell :( he's going to the vet's this evening but seeing him so uncomfortable is making me really anxious and upset :(..General: It's so so cold for October here in the UK. Where is this glorious Indian autumn I'm promised every year!? It'll be wooly coat time soon....
triumph: i hit a weight loss goal this morning. my first of a set of four goals. my reward? getting my nose pierced friday! ..struggle: i am holding anger towards my ex-room mate and i am trying to deal with it in a healthy manner. ..general: made the decision to get rid of cable today and instead got a fire stick. going to be saving some money which is great. i am excited that working on my debts and finance is something i care about now. less angry than yesterday. still feeling it all. no real desire to drink though. thankfully. :)
**Triumphs:** I have a few! ..1. I'm taking things slowly this time. Any time I've tried to stay sober in the past I've gone into self improvement overdrive. "I need to start eating healthy and cooking! I need to workout 5 days a week! So much time for these 10 hobbies I've been meaning to get into!" This ultimately leads to me burning myself out or thinking I have my act together which of course leads to relapse. I've learned that the most important thing for me right now is to not have that first drink and I can gradually incorporate these goals into my new life. So now i'm thinking "Pizza and ice cream no big deal. Don't feel like running today oh well I didn't drink hundreds of calories." ..2. My skin is finally clearing up. I've been seeing a dermatologist for the last 6 months and nothing he's prescribed me has worked. Its been extremely frustrating and taken a toll on my confidence. 8 days of no alcohol and I'm seeing vast improvements...3. Yesterday I had a conversation with my room mate that I've been putting off concerning the future of our living situation. It went better then expected for both of us. Communication yay!..**Struggle:** I'm still smoking weed. It helps me sleep through the night but makes it more difficult to wake up in the morning. I'd like to eventually cut this out of my life...**General:** I started listening to music that I was really into before I started drinking (late 90's pop punk stuff). It puts me in a good headspace and reminds me that I once did and still can enjoy things without alcohol..
Test
**Triumph:** I got a lot of work done yesterday. I turned in some writing for critique. I have been much more productive with my writing lately; I still feel uncertain about what I'm producing but I'm proud that I'm producing anything at all. ..**Struggle:** I have such a deep conviction in my brain that I am unloved and can't belong anywhere. Also I haven't been taking my antidepressants this week and I have been so so emotional...**General:** The weather is perfect. PERFECT. I'm scared for winter to arrive (always brings out the worst of my depression) but this part of fall is so beautiful; I'm trying to cherish every day.
Triumph: Meditation is up anxiety is down...Struggle: Eating more as I drink less need to work harder on curbing all types of impulses I guess...General: Life is hard but worth it.
Triumph: 67 days is starting to sound like a reasonable amount of time. And my energy is better. ..Struggle: Can't decide how open to be about not drinking with friends. My impulse is to just say "I quit." But I think there's a part of me that believes I will drink again and that part doesn't want to say or imply I've quit for good. That bothers me. Last night I said I was taking a sober October to lose weight but I didn't like shading the truth that way. Tonight I think I will say "I am not drinking tonight; I sleep better without it." ..General: I just ate an entire pint of coffee-toffee ice cream. It was delicious. 
**TRIUMPH:** after almost 2 months my wife says she has seen a change for the better in me and that it has encouraged her to want to try to deal with her own issues (drinking and other)...**STRUGGLE:** tough to keep myself from looking into the future and worrying how things will work out.  It's always been a problem for me but at least I'm able to think things through more clearly now...**General:** my late Grandmother used to make the most incredible individual sized "hand pies" from scratch (apple and apricot).  I really miss her. 
Triumph:  Didn't drink despite having by far one of the more worse days yesterday since beginning sobriety.  Wife is beginning therapy and it is rehashing a lot of old things that I thought I had moved past but her bringing them up showed me I hadn't.  I still felt shame and guilt.  Best part about two people doing therapy is using each other's things we learn.  I went to my own devised happy place this morning and amazingly that place allowed me to remember I do a lot of good things too...Struggle:  Rewiring my damn brain to not be so hard on myself.  All my life I have just counted my mistakes and never really the nice things I have done which makes bad days super worse...General:  My dad was recently diagnosed with something and it makes me sad still and probably always will that it comes with getting old.  Getting old is a big fear of mine.
**Triumph:** It's been a hard week but I'm still here.  I am not tempted to drink in the slightest.  I guess that's a triumph...**Struggle:** A year ago I told myself that I would wait a year before making any major life changes.  I have realized that I am still terribly unhappy in my marriage and am trying to figure out how to go about asking for a divorce or separation.  Even coming to the decision has been terrible.  I don't know how the hell I'm going to proceed.  I still love him a lot in a friend way that I would love to preserve but doubt he will let me.  Our kids are teens or near teens.  I don't want to rip apart our family.  I just feel like I can't take living with him anymore...**General:** Pie is amazing.  I bake tons of pie. I think I will bake an apple pie tomorrow to cheer myself up.
