So this is a question I've had for some time. There is a debate among AA members as to whether smoking weed while not drinking is considered sobriety and whether it's proper to do it...I understand the arguments. Here is what I've seen so far:..1. YES to Weed: Alcoholics who smoke weed will not want to go out and get a drink. Weed also helps get your mind off of drinking. If some alcoholics can smoke cigarettes then why not weed? Wouldn't smoking cigarettes be worse for you?..2. NO to Weed: A person who smokes weed is never truly sober. Also smoking weed can be habit forming. A person with depression may choose to smoke weed every day and not be living their life as he or she should. Those who are also addicts should never touch weed because it may lead them to relapse on harder drugs and inevitably alcohol...Where do you stand on this?
----------immediate responses--------

I understand both sides and I see how for some people smoking weed can become a replacement for alcohol/habit-forming...For me though weed has helped me sleep much better in early sobriety. I don't get a hangover I don't text/say/do things I regret I don't seek out harder drugs I don't put myself in dangerous situations. It doesn't exacerbate my depression or anxiety (if it did I would absolutely stop). I think it depends on the person. Eventually I'd like to be totally sober but for now smoking weed works for me.
&gt; NO to Weed: A person who smokes weed is never truly sober. ..I don't give a rats ass what you call it I smoke weed and haven't drank in nearly 9 months. Sober or not I've removed the problem in my life and I'm happier.
That's not really a debate in AA... that's a justification by people who think addiction is confined to a single substance and that the one substance is their only problem...Personally I don't smoke weed because I know it will lower my inhibitions and impair my judgment and make it more likely for me to think I can have just one drink. And i know when i take mind altering substances i will eventually start doing it compulsively. I've seen a lot of people migrate back to their DOC after the marijuana maintenance plan. Some don't more do. ..Quitting drinking is only the beginning part of AA. Living a happy fulfilling life without needing the crutch of a substance to get you through the ups and downs and being of service to others is what it's ultimately about. 
Lots of folks like CBD oil they say it helps and I admit I'm mighty curious also but no weed products for me for work because we get drug tested.  I guess if a person wanted to be a purist they wouldn't want to smoke or anything.  I know one thing I won't be drinking with you  
&gt; Alcoholics who smoke weed will not want to go out and get a drink. ..This is 100 percent not true for me and is basically why I choose not to smoke weed. At some point for me weed is not going to be enough. ..Everyone is different though.
I'm not in AA although I used to be...This is my take. AA's make a big deal about "singleness of purpose". The program is about alcohol and only alcohol. There is also the Third Tradition...This means that any discussion about other substances is per se not part of the program. ..And if there were to be a discussion about other potentially addictive or harmful substances and people were declared "not sober" for using substances other than alcohol then this would logically have to apply to nicotine caffeine....and maybe sugar. Also what about behavioral addictions like gambling sex shopping etc?..My feeling is you can't have it both ways: you can't have singleness of purpose at the same time as you have restrictions on the use of substances other than alcohol..
I smoke. It helps me tremendously.
I think thats one of the only you can answer that question questions. I smoke weed almost every night before bed. Weed doesn't turn me into another person like alcohol does. If anything it slows down a very anxious and nervous person I also don't feel like I need it. I run out sometimes and i'll forget to refill my prescription for a couple of days. My thoughts on weed is we've only really recently got the green light to start studying it in medical fields and I think it's honestly proven to be really helpful. It's helped people with seizures and with cancer. Why can't it help addicts? I know there are some that hail the benefits of it and some who say it's just as bad. All I know is I've never been hungover from weed I get good sleep and all around my anxiety and depression is way more manageable when I smoke fairly regularly. 
I think it all lies in intentions. I mean people drink coffee all the time in AA. It's definitely a mood altering substance. For me I would just check why am I using this substance? Will it lead to a healthier way of life? Does it align with my new value system? 
I take a middle of the road approach. I do not consider myself a sober person because I still smoke weed. I quit drinking as I cannot control how much I drink when I do but I am able to keep myself in check when I smoke. ..As others have said it comes down to the individual and whether or not weed makes you want to drink. It doesn't for me and I am comfortable with using it to turn down my brain for a bit. I will also go months without smoking and be perfectly fine with it...Can you be considered sober while high? No definitely not. Can you be high and not have it impact you're daily life in a negative manner? Like alcohol that is dependent on who you are. Some can drink and not have a problem. Some can smoke and not have it lead to anything beyond ordering pizza and playing video games. Others cannot...Regarding sobriety it depends on your goal. If you want to live a life fully clear headed stay away from all mind altering substances. If alcohol is truly the only substance you abuse then I personally don't see the harm in smoking now and again. Just be mindful of where it takes you and if any negative traits develop from it discontinue usage immediately.
I think the danger is just in replacing one addiction with another. If you go from drinking every day to getting high every day I wouldn't really consider you to be  sober  but I do think that pot is a lot less harmful for most people than alcohol it won't destroy your liver or your pancreas or cause you to become violent and angry. 
Aside from the clear statistical data as weed is better for people than alcohol. I will agree that your life can be just as debilitated if you lounge around not doing anything productive because you smoke too much as with drinking. ..I haven't been able to smoke for six years because I've been in the military. I'm getting out this July and honestly I cannot wait to smoke. I hardly ever drank before enlisting and it has had a lot of negative effects on my life situations and my health. ..I was so much more happy productive active and went out more before when I smoked. So I totally advocate smoking especially if it helps you quit drinking. But as long as it doesn't take over your life..
If I were to smoke weed I'd reset my sobriety date...If someone else smokes weed I would **not** tell them to reset theirs...Marijuana the way I've experienced it is pretty psychoactive. It's a drug that does more than cigarettes or coffee. It's a drug I would abuse if I smoked at all (it's been 6 years.) So I toss that into the pile with alcohol heroin pills etc...But that's just where I stand. I let others resolve their own path of sobriety when it comes to marijuana. I wouldn't badger an alcoholic--in A.A. or elsewhere--about pot. I only ask people be cautious.
thats something that only you can decide for yourself ..for me I smoke up a bit every now and then holidays special occasions and yeah once and a while just for the hell of it but I try not to turn back into the pot head version of me that I was in college lol...Alcohol was always much more of a problem for me that weed was even in my heaviest smoking days.
I used to smoke occasionally when I first quit drinking but I tend to get a little too anxious when I'm even slightly high. Plus the munchies hit me so hard I just eat non-stop. Nowadays I like having my head be as clear as possible...weed kinda clouds things up for me and I tend to do dumb stoner shit like misplace my keys and lose my wallet.
Its an individual decision to be 100% honest. You have to decide for yourself if marijuana is something you can have in your recovery. I started smoking weed again recently at night before bed and regret it. I dont think it set back my recovery at all and it doesnt make me want to drink but i just feel more groggy in the morning from staying up late to watch cartoons stoned when id otherwise be asleep. Has it had a huge negative impact on my life? No but it hasnt really added anything positive to my life either do im hoing to be putting down the pipe yet again. As for you only you can make the call whether or not weed is acceptable for you to use.
Isn't the purpose of getting sober from alcohol to be  sober ? Quitting alcohol is not impressive if you just switch to other psychoactive drugs. Sure your liver gets a break but now your lungs are gonna take a beating.
I used to smoke weed a lot for several years before my addiction to alcohol developed. As I began to drink more I stopped liking the way weed made me feel as much and I decreased the habit to the point where I felt completely in control and at ease with how much I smoked and I still smoke sometimes these days. My roommates at the time smoked constantly and I turned it down all the time without issue. I couldn't do that with alcohol anymore I would never turn it down. All I'm saying is I think it has to do with your individual relationship to a substance. Only you know how that relationship feels and once it starts to feel dependent I'd try to make moves to let it go. I will say not drinking makes me less interested in doing any drugs as I just really enjoy the clarity and energy of my natural sober state!
there has been a lot of post in this sub the past few days about weed and every single time the answer comes back to &gt;.Do what is best for *you*..Weed effects everyone different people have different definitions of what "sobriety" means to them nothing works for everyone all of the time. ..Do what you think is best and do what makes you feel the best and helps you stay sober from alcohol 
Been smoking long before i started drinking and Noe and sober but still get high. It also helps my glaucoma.
**for me** i am an addict.  The substance does not really matter getting high drunk stoned whatever does matter.  and I am much better off without it...To me weed is a drug just as alcohol is a drug.  ..Maybe there is a "casual user" out there who can do it and "get away with it" long term but I don't know any...Cigarettes are bad for you true but using that argument why not heroin?
Problem here is that if I smoke weed I will drink.  Know this by long experience.  For some reason weed gives me just enough anxiety to feel I need a drink.
I personally don't like AA and wont do it ever again. For me it was just a weird and negative experience with allot of people on power trips and piss poor attitudes...For me having people prod me about how I felt throwing suggestions for upcoming feelings I'd feel telling me how to live my life (i.e. not smoking weed it's an escape not true sobriety) etc. wasn't my thing!..Im going on two weeks as happy as can be the thought of an AA meeting where someone is going to be grumpy/pissy having to hear some AA guru rant like he's a life coach with a PhD in addiction? No thanks!!..On the whole weed thing specifically? I feel like its up to you and is different for everyone. I smoked the first two days I quit booze at night and since then haven't had an urge like I do with alcohol haven't  bought any. Its never been a problem for me...Also if someone is just jonsing for a drink and they smoke weed instead? I call that a temporary win that their liver will appreciate the next day.
I used weed habitually/daily before I did the same with alcohol. Getting a high would be a symptom of the same problem that caused my problem drinking. In order to live in recovery and improve myself weed is not an option for me. Learning to find happiness cope with struggles and find connection and purpose without substances is the best path forward for me.
