relapsed on my birthday and it cost me my job. I have some money saved up for about 4-6 months of tight living and fortunately don't have dependents. i was offered complimentary therapy which is good and have groups lined up. standard worries coming off a hard detox... just was looking for a little kindness if anyone has some to spare. I think if I can get to 14 days to start I would start trying giving plasma to delay the income depletion. I'm just spewing. appreciate you all
